The company currently sits on a paper loss of $158 million, with the company also set to acquire Semler Scientific to expand its portfolio of Bitcoin. Holders of the Variable Rate Series A Perpetual Preferreds are set to see their distributions reduced from next year. These currently have a 13% current yield. Strive Asset Management, LLC ( ASST ) offers a jumbled and, in my opinion, currently hard to invest in Bitcoin (BTC-USD) as a treasury business strategy that aimed to ride the bandwagon established by Strategy ( MSTR ) but faces headwinds from elevated financing costs and a constrained premium to its BTC holdings. The company owned 7,525 BTC as of its most recent purchase of the cryptocurrency, with this bought at an average price of $113,383 per BTC for an aggregate nominal amount of $853.21 million. With BTC currently valued at $92,438, around $695 million in aggregate, ASST sits on a significant paper loss of around $158 million. While bulls would be right to highlight a market cap of $859 million puts ASST's mNAV at a decent 1.24x, this is far below MSTR's premium that was well north of 2x before the recent BTC dip. BTC as a treasury is anchored on constant access to the capital market to raise funds recycled into buying BTC. ASST needs to be able to continually sell its common equity to achieve this, but would see its BTC per share come in at a materially lower clip in the event its mNAV continues to narrow. Strive ASST's philosophy in a crowded marketplace of global BTC treasury companies is to focus on BTC per share and use the cryptocurrency as its hurdle rate for deploying capital. The hurdle rate is a term mainly used in private equity that describes the minimum rate of return required on an investment. ASST, which is the 14th largest publicly listed BTC as a treasury company, is likely describing a policy to BTC purchasing policy that limits new buys on pre-determined BTC per share metrics. The company is young, only going public in September through a merger with Asset Entities. ASST has since gone on to engineer an all-stock acquisition of Semler Scientific ( SMLR ). The deal would see ASST pay SMLR $90.52 per share, which represented a 210% premium at the time the acquisition was announced. Strive Website The Variable Rate Preferreds, Semler Scientific, Liquidity, And Cash Burn SMLR is currently trading for $20.33 per share at a $310 million market capitalization. It also currently owns 5,048 BTC, valued at $467 million. The clear mismatch between SMLR's current market cap, the implied acquisition market cap at $1.38 billion, and the value of SMLR's BTC holdings reflects the upside-down nature of the deal. The overall BTC as a treasury strategy depends on the constant tapping of investor euphoria to issue shares at a strong premium to buy BTC. The mismatch reflects the sustained pullback of BTC since the deal was announced, and a likelihood that the deal will be significantly altered. It simply does not make sense for ASST to pay $1.38 billion for BTC that's valued at less than half of this amount. It's entirely against ASST's own philosophy to focus on BTC per share, as they could just sell half the amount of shares they would need to exchange for the acquisition and own more BTC at current prices. For investors looking for BTC exposure, it won't make sense to pay such a premium when direct ownership or the use of an ETF would net more BTC. QuantumOnline ASST currently has a Variable Rate Series A Perpetual Preferred Stock ( SATA ) outstanding. These started trading shortly after the firm's IPO and is set to be used along with a $450 million at-the-market (""ATM"") common stock offering shelf, and cash and cash equivalents on its balance sheet of $109 million as of the end of the fiscal 2025 third quarter to buy BTC. There were 2 million shares of SATA offered, upsized by 750,000 shares from the prior announcement, with the shares sold for $80 per share for gross proceeds of $160 million. The preferreds currently pay a $12 annual coupon , in monthly distributions, for a 13% current yield as they're currently swapping hands for $91.61 per share. QuantumOnline Further, as they're perpetual, ASST is under no obligation to redeem these at any point. They have a $100 per share liquidation value, so they're currently trading hands at an 8.4% discount to this. This works for investors looking for a forever income security, but in aggregate with the unique variable terms of the preferreds, raises significant risk that ASST will face headwinds in making what's currently a $24 million per year coupon payment. ASST needs constant access to the capital markets to be able to copy the MSTR strategy, so the use of monthly distributions and selling the preferreds at a discount was meant as sweeteners to get investors on board with the offering. Seeking Alpha ASST can start reducing the variable payments from three months after its IPO. This is limited to the aggregate of 25 basis points and the excess of one-month term SOFR on the first business day of the relevant distribution, over the minimum of the one-month term SOFR from the previous distribution period. As ASST pays out monthly, this implies that it can, from the first quarter of next year, reduce the distribution on the preferreds by at least 25 basis points per month, around 300 basis points per year. This would compress its coupon rate from 12% to 9% over 12 months at a minimum, lower than the 10% MSTR pays to the holders of some of its preferreds. SATA is up from its IPO as they were sold at such a steep discount, but the December Fed rate cut, in aggregate with a weak BTC price and the eventual 3-month hurdle, is likely set to see these trade lower. Cash flow from operations was $22.1 million during the third quarter, with ASST's cash balance set to cover this rate of operational cash burn by just under 5 quarters. However, the company maintains access to capital markets with an ongoing ATM program and can tap its BTC holdings for sales to meet its operational cash burn needs and extend its cash runway. Conclusion ASST's BTC holdings are upside-down, trading at a significant loss to its average buy price, just as its stock continues to dip. This is now down 92.4% from their 52-week-high. There are now far too many BTC as treasury companies available to investors to buy, with the list north of 100, not including the ETFs.

As the top meme coin bounces off a key support, could this favor a bullish Dogecoin price prediction ? According to data from BitInfoCharts, the number of daily active addresses (DAAs) within the Dogecoin blockchain spiked to its second highest level in three months on December 3 at 67,511. The highest reading during this period occurred on September 15, back when DOGE hit a local top of $0.30 and started retreating to its current levels. What this metric may have indicated back then is that a significant number of wallets were both buying and selling, as the price hit a high level. This time, following a 50% retreat from those highs, this could be evidence that this is a highly contested area for both bulls and bears again. Interestingly, DOGE has gone up by 3.5% in the past 24 hours and currently stands at $0.14. This has been a key area of support for the token from which it has bounced three times already. Trading volumes have more than doubled, further confirming that buying pressure is increasing rapidly. Paired with higher wallet usage, could Dogecoin be getting ready to reverse its downtrend? Dogecoin Price Prediction: Key Levels to Watch as $0.14 Holds Strong Dogecoin has gone up today, and trading volumes are accompanying the move as the token bounces from the $0.14 level. Source: TradingView The pivotal area for DOGE is the $0.16 mark, as a move above this area would confirm a trend reversal and finally break the token’s bearish structure. The first and most likely target if this happens would be the 200-day exponential moving average (EMA), as this is typically a high-volume price zone. Meanwhile, a bullish breakout above this key line would confirm a positive mid-term outlook for Dogecoin. If that’s the case, we could see the token spiking back to its September 2025 levels, back when daily active addresses reached their 3-month peak. This week is critical for the markets as the Federal Reserve will convene on Wednesday to make a decision on interest rates. A rate cut could be exactly what the market needs to propel crypto prices back to their recent highs . As the meme coin market gears up for a potential breakout, all eyes are shifting to early-stage presales with the highest upside. Maxi Doge ($MAXI) is one of the most talked-about presales in the space right now, and with momentum building fast, it could be the next major gainer once listings go live. Maxi Doge ($MAXI) Raises Over $4 Million Despite the Market’s Turmoil The latest wave of selling has not deterred investors from piling into Maxi Doge ($MAXI) . This new meme coin embodies the hype that comes with bull markets and aims to build a thriving community of ‘degen’ traders who love taking big risks in exchange for big gains.

After months of sustained selling pressure and increased whale activity, the market is now watching whether Solana can hold its recent gains or slip back toward lower support zones. Related Reading: What’s Happening With XRP And Why Did Its Spot ETF Crash 20%? This comes at a time when analysts, on-chain trackers, and market participants are also assessing the broader influence of KOL (Key Opinion Leader) predictions, many of which have dramatically misaligned with Solana’s actual price trajectory over the past two months. SOL's price sees some small gains on the daily chart. Source: SOLUSD on Tradingview Solana Price Stalls Below Key Resistance SOL is currently trading just under $138 after a modest recovery from the $128 low. Technical data indicates that the Solana price is struggling beneath a dense cluster of moving averages, with the 20-day EMA at $138 repeatedly rejecting upward attempts. The intraday structure remains corrective, as rallies tend to fade before gaining traction. A sustained close above $140 remains the key threshold. Clearing it could open immediate targets near $142 and later $150. However, failure at this level risks renewed pullbacks toward $132, and deeper weakness could revisit $128 region. Short-term indicators offer mixed signals. The hourly RSI remains above 50, while the MACD leans slightly bullish, suggesting that momentum exists but lacks conviction. KOL Predictions Scrutinized as Market Cap Declines Solana’s market cap has fallen roughly 40.5% over the past two months, contradicting bullish influencer claims made earlier in the quarter. Data from Santiment shows how traders predict a near-term all-time high, only for SOL to continue its downward slide. This divergence is leading analysts to lean more heavily on tools like the KOLs_Tracker, which ranks influencer performance and helps identify when certain calls may function as contrarian signals. The gap between predictions and actual performance has added an extra layer of volatility to Solana’s narrative, as traders use social sentiment data alongside traditional indicators to gauge market direction. With network activity and flows still subdued, traders are approaching such predictions with increased caution. Liquidity Shifts Highlight Whale Influence On-chain activity shows notable movement from large holders, including a whale that recently transferred 100,000 SOL to Binance, part of a broader trend that has seen over 600,000 SOL moved to exchanges since April. While not enough to move the market on its own, such consistent selling reinforces resistance zones and limits recovery momentum. The address still holds more than 700,000 SOL, meaning additional liquidity could enter the market if the Solana price approaches previously favored selling levels. Related Reading: Ethereum Founder Breaks Silence With Major Upgrade Proposal As the Solana price deals with this tight range, market participants remain focused on whether buyers can establish a base above $138–$140. Until then, resistance remains firm, sentiment remains cautious, and the path forward depends on both technical confirmation and the broader crypto market direction.

Speaking at the Bitcoin MENA event in Abu Dhabi, Saylor suggested countries could use overcollateralized Bitcoin reserves and tokenized credit assets to launch regulated digital bank accounts that offer higher yields than traditional deposits. Saylor’s comments come as the CEOs of Citigroup, Wells Fargo, and Bank of America are scheduled to meet with both Republican and Democratic senators this week to discuss legislation focused on crypto market structure. As earlier reported by Cryptopolitan , Bank executives and U.S. senators are expected to gather on Thursday at the Financial Services Forum, a bank trade group that is organizing the meeting. “The meeting is another opportunity to share [the banks’] perspectives and serve as constructive partners in crafting smart policy to ensure the U.S. remains a digital assets leader,” a spokesperson for FSF said. Topics that are priority to cover include bank permissibility, as well as payment of interest and illicit finance, the spokesperson noted, adding that “meetings between our CEOs and lawmakers happen often.” Saylor underscored the motivation behind his proposal by pointing to low global yields. Bank deposits in Japan, Europe, and Switzerland provide little to no yield, Saylor pointed out, while euro money-market funds yield around 150 basis points, and US money-market rates remain closer to 400 basis points. This, he added, is why investors resort to the corporate bond market, which “wouldn’t exist if people weren’t so disgusted with their bank account.” New framework proposes overcollateralized BTC reserves Saylor described a framework in which digital credit products comprise approximately 80% of a fund, with another 20% in fiat currencies , and a 10% reserve buffer built on top to mitigate excess volatility. If such a product were available on a regulated bank’s platform, depositors could place billions of dollars in institutions to obtain larger deposits. The account would be backed by digital credit with 5:1 overcollateralization held by a treasury body, he added. In Saylor’s view, the country offering such accounts may attract “20 trillion or 50 trillion dollars” in additional capital flows. The CEO suggested that a country adopting this line could become the international “digital banking capital of the world.” The comments followed Saylor’s revelation on X that the company had purchased 10,624 BTC for roughly $962.7 million the previous week. The latest buy increases Strategy’s ownership of the asset to 660,624 BTC, purchased for about $49.35 billion at an average cost of $74,696. Saylor’s description of a high-yield, low-volatility digital bank product is reminiscent of some of what Strategy sells. In July, the company debuted STRC, a money-market-style preferred share with a variable dividend rate of around 10% and a structure designed to maintain its price near par while being backed by Strategy’s Bitcoin-linked treasury operations. Although the product has already grown to around $2.9 billion in market cap, it has also been met with some skepticism. Critics question volatility risks as Saylor expands BTC holdings Bitcoin’s volatility is one reason some observers question Saylor’s push for Bitcoin-backed, high-yield credit instruments. Bitcoin has delivered strong long-term returns, but its short-term performance remains unpredictable. Although the product has already reached a market capitalization of around $2.9 billion, it has also faced some skepticism. And Bitcoin’s volatility is one reason some people wonder whether Saylor’s push toward Bitcoin-backed credit instruments, with high yields, is too big a stretch. So far, Bitcoin has posted strong long-term returns, but it doesn’t give much insight into its immediate performance. Bitcoin has been trading at around $90,911 as of the time of this post, roughly 28% less than its record high of $126,080 on Oct. 6, and approximately 9% less over the past 12 months, according to CoinGecko. However, over five years, BTC has increased by 1,155% from $7,193 on January 1, 2020. During October, a former Salomon Brothers bond and derivatives trader, Josh Man, called Saylor’s moves “folly” and suggested STRC could suffer a liquidity event. He wrote: “The fiat banking system has been around a long time and has figured out how to build a moat around demand deposits so that they don’t break the buck. Hiking rates on STRC to maintain/defend a peg or price level is not going to work when depositors want to get their money back out.” Get $50 free to trade crypto when you sign up to Bybit now",News|Bitcoin,EN,0,0,BTC|FIAT|MARKET|REGULATION|TRADING|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-12-08 23:16:52

Economists are betting on a rate cut come Wednesday, which has helped to lift prices after a difficult few weeks for crypto. Bitcoin is up by 3% today, while altcoins such as Ethereum, Solana, and Cardano have posted gains closer to 4%, while Canton and Zcash are up by more than 13%. Now is therefore a good time to be reentering the market, and we’ve accordingly picked our next altcoin to turn $100 into $10,000, which is the exciting new ERC-20 token PEPENODE ($PEPENODE) . Next Altcoin to Turn $100 into $10,000 – 8 December First unveiled in September, PEPENODE has since gone on to raise more than $2.2 million in its ongoing presale, which is quickly attracting new converts. This figure provides a strong vote of confidence in the new project, which is aiming to make cryptocurrency mining more accessible to average investors. It will do this by enabling users to build and run their own virtual mining rigs, instead of requiring them to invest in expensive mining hardware, as proof-of-work cryptocurrencies do. By spending PEPENODE tokens on new virtual nodes and by upgrading and combining these nodes, users can earn greater mining rewards. PEPENODE pays out mining rewards in external tokens such as Fartcoin and Pepe, providing users with a very strong incentive to acquire more PEPENODE tokens in order to enhance their mining rigs. There may be multiple paths but they always lead back to one thing… Upgrading Those Nodes https://t.co/FaKIaBoHfa pic.twitter.com/L6mF94nPB9 — PEPENODE (@pepenode_io) December 8, 2025 Holders of the token will also be able to stake it for a passive income, with the current rate of return at 565% APY . This is hugely generous, and arguably makes PEPENODE one of the most attractive new tokens to invest in at the moment. PEPENODE Will Launch Soon: Here’s How to Buy Early Traders can invest in PEPENODE by going to its official website and joining its presale, which will run for several more weeks, at which point the coin will list on exchanges. PEPENODE will have a max supply of 210 billion tokens, with its allocation divided between development, marketing, node rewards, liquidity, and its treasury. It’s currently selling at a price of $0.0011825, although this price will continue to rise every three days until the same comes to an end. Investors can use ETH, USDT, BNB, or fiat to buy whatever amount of the token they want, and will receive their coins once the sale closes. Given the market appears to be preparing for a big comeback, now may be an ideal time for a new token launch. And because it has such strong fundamentals, PEPENODE is our next altcoin to turn $100 into $10,000.

He argues that multi-year low gas fees have bred complacency, with a massive shift in retail activity to cheaper Layer 2 networks like Base and Arbitrum sidelining the altcoin’s issue. Average Ethereum gas price. Source: Etherscan . His solution: an on-chain prediction market designed to help users secure future gas prices and mitigate sudden spikes in transaction costs on the network. We need a good trustless onchain gas futures market. (Like, a prediction market on the BASEFEE) I've heard people ask: ""today fees are low, but what about in 2 years? You say they'll stay low because of increasing gaslimit from BAL + ePBS + later ZK-EVM, but do I believe you?""… — vitalik.eth (@VitalikButerin) December 6, 2025 An on-chain futures curve would provide a clear signal of long-term market expectations. It would permit users to prepay for block space and lock in costs regardless of future spikes. With a shared reference point for future network conditions, developers could buy gas insurance to cap operating costs ahead of critical events, while heavy users could also offset future fee spikes by taking the opposite market position. This all amounts to a more favourable platform for users, facilitating the transition from web-2 to web-3 as blockchain technology needs the reliability expected at the institutional level. Ethereum Price Predictions: Adoption Could Fuel New All-Time Highs The potential adoption of controlled gas fees could bring to Ethereum could help fuel the breakout of a bullish 19-month head-and-shoulder pattern, now unfolding.

The RSI is closing in on the 50 neutral line, forming several higher lows as buyers step in. The MACD also displays a growing lead on the signal line, suggesting a sustained bullish trend. A fully realised pattern breakout could see the neckline reclaimed around $5,500 , reclaiming past all-time highs and entering new price discovery in a 90% move . But as the bull market matures, if Ethereum finds a bigger part to play in the transition from Web2 to Web3, the move could extend 250% to $10,000 .

Here’s The Latest,https://timestabloid.com/another-win-for-xrp-in-asia-heres-the-latest/,"Professional investors in Hong Kong now have direct access to XRP trading using the Hong Kong Dollar (HKD), following its addition to the lineup of assets available on OSL, one of the region’s licensed digital asset exchanges. The platform disclosed that XRP has been integrated into its Flash Trade service, broadening its market offerings for institutional-level users who operate under Hong Kong’s regulatory framework. OSL confirmed that both deposits and withdrawals for XRP are active on the XRP Ledger (XRPL). With this update, trading is available across three markets: XRP/HKD, XRP/USDT, and XRP/USD. Under local rules, only clients classified as Professional Investors can use this feature, and OSL emphasized that the restriction is consistent with the jurisdiction’s compliance standards. XRP is now available at OSL HK — secure, compliant access to one of the world’s most established digital assets. Renowned for its speed and efficiency in cross-border transactions, XRP expands OSL HK’s token lineup. Available to Professional Investors via Flash Trade &… pic.twitter.com/SWFUlCIta9 — OSL HK (@OSL_HK) December 5, 2025 Importance of the HKD Trading Pair The introduction of an XRP/HKD pair represents an important development for investors seeking direct exposure without relying on foreign stablecoins or multiple conversions. Although several licensed exchanges in Hong Kong support XRP, most only offer trading against stablecoins such as USDT. HashKey , for example, provides access to XRP but does not currently offer an HKD pair. OSL’s decision to enable HKD-based trading gives market participants a more convenient way to access the asset and reduces dependence on additional currency conversions. Hong Kong’s Supportive Regulatory Landscape Hong Kong continues to position itself as a welcoming environment for digital asset companies through clear and structured regulations. The government has taken steps to attract reputable industry players while maintaining oversight, resulting in a market that encourages innovation while adhering to compliance requirements. Within this environment, the availability of a direct HKD pair strengthens XRP’s presence and supports broader adoption among investors who prefer to operate within a recognized regulatory system. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 As part of the listing announcement, OSL outlined the characteristics that define XRP’s use case. The exchange noted that XRP is designed to facilitate low-cost cross-border transactions and microtransactions, supported by the XRPL’s rapid settlement time, which generally completes transfers within a few seconds. OSL also referenced the asset’s decentralized validator network and its ability to move value without centralized oversight. Market Context and Recent XRP Performance The listing arrives at a time when XRP has shown upward movement in the broader market. Over the past 24 hours, the asset recorded an increase of about 4.75%, reaching a price of $2.09 . This positive momentum, combined with expanded trading access in a regulated center like Hong Kong, may encourage renewed attention from institutional investors. By enabling XRP/HKD trading, OSL has created a more accessible pathway for professional investors and reinforced Hong Kong’s status as one of the few jurisdictions offering regulated fiat-paired XRP trading. This development simplifies entry into the asset, aligns with the region’s commitment to transparent digital asset activity, and enhances the range of trading options available to institutions operating within Hong Kong’s financial system.

The current plans offer valuable tax advantages, but they force investors to deal with narrow, state-selected mutual fund portfolios that underperform relative to IRAs and HSAs. According to the Bitcoin Policy Institute, those limitations prevent households from accessing inflation-resistant assets and stronger long-term growth opportunities. The Bitcoin Policy Institute’s research has evaluated how modernizing 529 plans to permit Bitcoin allocations could improve returns and better safeguard education savings, working on the premise of Bitcoin’s history of delivering strong long-term performance and offering diversification benefits due to its low correlation with equities. Bitcoin Policy Institute drums up BTC for 529 plans According to the findings, portfolio modeling shows that even small allocations of Bitcoin (1–2%) increase compound annual returns and Sharpe ratios, boosting portfolio efficiency without materially increasing risk. The policy recommends the issuance of federal guidance or amendment of the tax code to allow Bitcoin in 529 plans, aligning them with the investment flexibility of IRAs and HSAs, with claims that such a model would streamline nationwide adoption.‍ Another recommendation is to establish the first Bitcoin-inclusive 529 plan in Wyoming—the only state without a current plan and encourage states to update their 529 offerings by incorporating BTC and other alternative assets, expanding payment capabilities (such as ACH), and advocating for more flexible rules on portfolio adjustments. The bottom line is that modernizing 529 plans—through federal guidance, state innovation, or both—would expand investor choice, increase portfolio resilience, and align education savings strategies with today’s financial realities. Growing interest in digital assets at the state level The discussion happening around BTC and 529 plans is happening as momentum around crypto-linked retirement exposure continues to grow nationwide, with citizens of the US looking forward to using their retirement savings to invest in cryptocurrencies, private equity, property, gold and other kinds of non-traditional assets. The consensus right now is that a presidential executive order has cleared the way for fiduciaries to offer crypto investments as an option. However, it will take some time for widespread availability to be implemented. In the meantime, regulatory bodies are working on new guidance to facilitate the change. In Indiana, there is a newly introduced bill that would require public retirement programs to offer Bitcoin-related investment options and also limit how much power local governments have to restrict the use of digital assets. The proposal, known as House Bill 1042, was filed on Thursday, December 4, by State Representative Kyle Pierce, a Republican from Anderson, and was presented during a meeting of the House Financial Institutions Committee. Its main focus is on giving public workers access to cryptocurrency investments while setting clear legal boundaries around digital asset use, custody, payments, and mining. Aside from forcing administrators of several state-run retirement and savings plans to include cryptocurrency exchange-traded funds as standard investment choices, the proposal would also permit certain public pension funds to invest directly in crypto-linked ETFs and give the state treasurer authority to place funds from specific accounts into stablecoin-based ETFs. According to Pierce, the bill is designed to give Indiana residents more financial flexibility, balancing investment choice with regulatory guardrails while allowing the state to explore potential government use of blockchain technology through pilot programs. The bill also includes clear safeguards for self-custody, and if enacted, would make Indiana the first state in the country to require publicly managed retirement programs to provide Bitcoin exposure as a standard option. Other states have taken similar steps, but none as overt as Indiana. Last year, Oklahoma passed a law preserving residents’ right to hold crypto in self-custody wallets and blocking special taxes on Bitcoin transactions. Then this year, Kentucky did something similar by formally recognizing self-custody as a protected property right. Meanwhile, Wyoming approved laws that allow public pension funds to invest in digital assets, and Arizona introduced legislation that would allow Bitcoin ETFs in retirement accounts.

The operation started as a minor investigation into a simple fraudulent crypto platform. Gradually, it expanded into a complex probe of a vast, unscrupulous money-laundering network. How it Happened The thieves created and operated many forged cryptocurrency investment platforms. They used high-quality deepfake advertisements to make their projects seem legit. They repeatedly called their customers, promising massive returns on investment. They also showed their users fake proof of profits realized on their platforms, thereby attracting thousands to interact with and deposit funds into these fake crypto platforms. Once these naive crypto enthusiasts transferred their crypto assets to the fraudulent platforms, the criminals moved them across various crypto networks and exchanges, cashing out the funds and extending the chain of their actions. The criminal act targeted people from Spain, France, Belgium, Bulgaria, Germany, and Malta. Notably, it was not limited to Europe as some of the victims were from Cyprus and Israel, both West Asia countries. Hence, authorities from these affected countries were a part of the investigation. Authorities Takedown $815M Fraudsters The first phase of the operation was executed on 27 October 2025 and ended successfully. In response to requests from authorities in France and Germany, the police raided strategic locations in Cyprus, Germany, and Spain, arresting nine individuals suspected of engaging in the laundering of funds stolen through shady crypto project operations. Following their apprehension, the police seized $350 million (€300,000) in cash, $931,000 (€800,000) in bank accounts, and $483,000 (€415,000) in cryptocurrencies. They also confiscated digital devices and high-value wristwatches from the suspected criminals. As the authorities delved deeper in the case, they realized it had grown beyond a simple fraud scheme into a sophisticated criminal operation. Hence, they carried out the second phase of the investigation, targeting the affiliate marketing infrastructure used by these online scammers. Meanwhile, the authorities have not concluded their operations. They are still conducting thorough investigations into the remaining stolen funds and plan to crack down on other individuals involved in the fraudulent act.

The cryptocurrency market, often driven by sentiment and momentum, is now showing clear bearish signals that demand attention. Recent analysis reveals concerning patterns in both on-chain metrics and broader economic factors that could impact Bitcoin ‘s near-term trajectory. Let’s examine why the market sentiment has turned cautious and what these developments mean for your portfolio. Why Is Bitcoin Showing Bearish Signs Right Now? The current Bitcoin market presents a complex picture where traditional bullish catalysts appear to be losing steam. According to recent analysis, several key metrics have shifted toward a more bearish outlook. The monthly futures premium, a reliable gauge of market sentiment, has dropped below the neutral 5% threshold. This decline suggests that institutional traders are becoming less optimistic about Bitcoin ‘s immediate price prospects. Moreover, the options market tells an even clearer story—put options now carry a significant premium, indicating heightened demand for downside protection. What Do On-Chain Metrics Reveal About BTC’s Health? On-chain analysis provides crucial insights into Bitcoin ‘s fundamental strength, and current data points to concerning trends. The lack of substantial inflows into spot Bitcoin ETFs represents a significant shift from earlier this year when these products drove substantial buying pressure. Additionally, network activity and transaction volumes have shown patterns consistent with previous bearish phases. Key indicators to watch include: Futures premium below neutral levels – signaling reduced institutional optimism Elevated put option costs – indicating increased hedging against declines Reduced ETF inflows – showing diminished institutional participation Exchange outflow patterns – suggesting changing holder behavior How Are Macroeconomic Factors Impacting Bitcoin? The broader economic landscape plays a crucial role in cryptocurrency markets, and current conditions are creating headwinds for Bitcoin . The declining probability of Federal Reserve interest rate cuts removes a potential catalyst that many investors had anticipated. Higher interest rates typically reduce risk appetite across financial markets, including cryptocurrencies. Furthermore, the slump in the U.S. real estate market signals potential economic stress that could affect investor confidence. These macro factors combine to create a challenging environment for risk assets like Bitcoin . What Does the Options Market Tell Us About Sentiment? The derivatives market offers valuable insights into trader expectations, and current data reveals a distinctly bearish tilt. On Deribit, one of the largest crypto options exchanges, BTC put options are trading at a 13% premium compared to call options. This premium indicates that traders are willing to pay more for protection against price declines—a classic characteristic of bearish market conditions. The options skew, which measures the relative cost of puts versus calls, has shifted significantly toward puts, suggesting that professional traders are positioning for potential downside. Can Bitcoin Overcome These Bearish Headwinds? While the current indicators appear bearish , cryptocurrency markets have historically demonstrated remarkable resilience. However, overcoming these challenges requires monitoring several key developments. The return of sustained ETF inflows could provide necessary buying pressure, while any shift in Federal Reserve policy could improve risk sentiment. Additionally, Bitcoin ‘s upcoming halving event in 2024 remains a fundamental bullish factor that could eventually outweigh short-term bearish signals. Investors should watch for: Institutional adoption trends – particularly through regulated products Regulatory developments – that could improve market structure Network growth metrics – indicating fundamental adoption Macroeconomic policy shifts – that could improve risk appetite The current Bitcoin market presents a cautionary tale for investors. Multiple indicators from both on-chain data and macroeconomic analysis point to a bearish outlook that demands careful attention. While the cryptocurrency has weathered similar periods before, the convergence of negative signals across derivatives markets, ETF flows, and economic conditions suggests a period of heightened risk. Savvy investors should maintain a balanced perspective, recognizing both the challenges and the long-term potential of Bitcoin as a transformative asset class. Frequently Asked Questions What does ‘bearish’ mean for Bitcoin? ‘Bearish’ describes a market outlook where prices are expected to decline. For Bitcoin, this means indicators suggest the cryptocurrency may face downward pressure in the near term. How reliable are futures premiums as indicators? Futures premiums are generally reliable sentiment indicators because they reflect institutional expectations. When premiums drop below neutral levels, it suggests professional traders are less optimistic about immediate price appreciation. Why do put option premiums matter? Put options give holders the right to sell at a specific price. When these options trade at higher premiums than call options, it indicates increased demand for downside protection—a bearish signal. Can Bitcoin ETFs reverse bearish trends? Yes, sustained inflows into spot Bitcoin ETFs can provide significant buying pressure that could counteract bearish signals. However, current data shows diminished institutional participation through these vehicles. How long do bearish phases typically last in crypto? Bearish phases in cryptocurrency markets can vary significantly, from several weeks to multiple months. The duration depends on multiple factors including market structure, adoption trends, and macroeconomic conditions. Should I sell my Bitcoin during bearish periods? Investment decisions should align with your individual strategy and risk tolerance. Some investors use bearish periods to accumulate at lower prices, while others may reduce exposure.

But when sentiment hits extremes like this, it often signals the opposite of what traders expect and could favor a bullish XRP price prediction . Santiment data shows social sentiment has plunged into “Extreme Fear,” while CoinMarketCap’s Fear and Greed Index dropped to just 16. From Wednesday to Friday, XRP slipped from $2.20 to $2, capping off three days of selling pressure. Yet behind the scenes, investor interest appears to be building. XRP-linked ETFs have now recorded 15 consecutive days of net inflows, according to SoSo Value, totaling nearly $900 million in fresh capital. Combined assets under management for these funds now sit at $861 million, suggesting that both retail and institutional investors are positioning for a rebound. With fear rising and big money flowing in, this could be the early stage of a major reversal. XRP Price Prediction: XRP Is Forming a Bullish Falling Channel Pattern XRP has bounced off the $1.95 support zone and is now forming a series of higher lows, signaling a potential trend reversal. Source: TradingView The next key level to watch is $2.20. A breakout above this resistance, followed by a successful retest, could confirm a bullish reversal pattern and open the door to a rally toward $3+. In the past 24 hours, XRP has gained 3.3%, with trading volume jumping nearly 90%. With momentum building, the token could be positioning itself for a major breakout. As broader crypto sentiment begins to shift, some of the most promising new projects have continued to gain traction. One project in particular is Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) , a presale project building a Solana-powered layer-2 solution for Bitcoin. By combining Bitcoin’s security with Solana’s speed and scalability, $HYPER is creating a new level of utility for Bitcoin, and investors have taken notice, with millions raised so far. Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) Lets Investors Earn Passive Income on BTC Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) was created to address the Bitcoin blockchain’s long-standing scalability issues by introducing a Solana-powered infrastructure that reduces transaction fees and speeds up transaction speeds.

Revisiting Amazon’s Long-Term Growth Pattern The discussion gained momentum after market analyst 24hrscrypto1 referenced the growth of Amazon’s stock price during its early years. He pointed to data showing that Amazon traded at only $0.09 in the late 1990s before gradually rising to more than $229 over an extended period. According to the figures he shared, this represents a cumulative increase exceeding 250,000%. The analyst emphasized that Amazon did not immediately gain widespread recognition and spent many years in periods of slow movement before registering major gains. He argued that this timeline demonstrates how large returns often require sustained patience, especially in sectors that involve new technologies or emerging markets. Everyone crying that “XRP is taking forever” needs to look at this chart and breathe for a second… Amazon was $0.09 in 1997 and nobody cared… Nobody understood it Nobody had the patience People want Amazon level returns… …but with microwave level patience. pic.twitter.com/tcsAsssGZa — 𝟸𝟺𝙷𝚁𝚂𝙲𝚁𝚈𝙿𝚃𝙾 (@24hrscrypto1) December 8, 2025 Growing Concerns Inside the XRP Community The comparison surfaced amid increasing frustration among XRP holders. The asset has experienced slow momentum even as several major developments have unfolded. Ripple allocated $2.5 billion this year toward various initiatives, and XRP-focused exchange-traded funds reportedly accumulated close to $1 billion in their first month of activity. Despite these notable events, XRP’s price has fallen by more than 26% over the past two months. The extended consolidation has led many investors to express concern about XRP’s performance relative to other digital assets. According to 24hrscrypto1, the dissatisfaction reflects a broader trend in which many traders expect substantial gains within short periods but are reluctant to endure lengthy phases of limited price action. He argued that this mindset overlooks how long it can take for underlying technologies to develop and for market participants to fully appreciate their value.

Some commentators stated that the analogy does not hold up when reviewing long-term charts. One user, Mortimer, argued that Amazon’s price history shows steady progression over time, whereas XRP’s chart displays frequent stagnation across multiple years. He contended that the patterns are fundamentally different. In response, 24hrscrypto1 said that the appearance of Amazon’s growth curve is influenced by hindsight. He suggested that looking at Amazon’s early chart without knowledge of its future success would show slow progress similar to what XRP is currently experiencing. He maintained that XRP may still be in the early stages of realizing its potential. Another participant noted that, historically, XRP’s appreciation from its lowest recorded levels to its past highs still reflects strong lifetime gains. Even so, some analysts argue that the asset may have already passed its most significant growth phase. While some community members use Amazon’s history to support optimistic projections for XRP, others cautioned that equating a cryptocurrency with a longstanding corporation can lead to unrealistic assumptions. One critic pointed out that Amazon’s value is linked to a business producing revenue, while XRP functions as a digital asset without the same type of financial foundation. He warned that drawing parallels between the two may encourage misplaced confidence. Disclaimer : This content is meant to inform and should not be considered financial advice.

55523518,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=238787,1765238411,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Hold Bitcoin for Decades: Strategy CEO’s Bold 2065 Commitment Reveals Unwavering Conviction,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/strategy-ceo-hold-bitcoin-2065/,"BitcoinWorld Hold Bitcoin for Decades: Strategy CEO’s Bold 2065 Commitment Reveals Unwavering Conviction In a stunning declaration of long-term faith, Strategy CEO Phong Le has announced the company plans to hold Bitcoin in its treasury for over four decades, with a target date of 2065. This move signals a profound shift in how institutions view digital assets, not as a short-term trade, but as a generational store of value. But what does this mean for everyday investors and the broader crypto market? Why Would a Company Commit to Hold Bitcoin for 40+ Years? During a CNBC interview, Phong Le provided clear reasoning for this unprecedented timeline. He stated that Strategy’s stock remains a crucial vehicle for investors seeking exposure to Bitcoin, even after the introduction of spot Bitcoin ETFs. The decision to hold Bitcoin until at least 2065 is a strategic commitment to this thesis. It transforms Bitcoin from a speculative asset on the balance sheet into a core, long-term strategic holding. This approach communicates unwavering conviction to shareholders and the market. It suggests the company views Bitcoin’s potential maturation and adoption as a multi-decade journey. Therefore, they are insulating their strategy from short-term price volatility and regulatory noise. Strategy Stock vs. Spot Bitcoin ETFs: What’s the Better Play? Le’s comments highlight an interesting dynamic in the investment landscape. With spot ETFs now available, why choose a company stock to gain Bitcoin exposure? Le argues Strategy offers something unique. Active Management: The company can make strategic decisions about buying, holding, or leveraging its Bitcoin position. Additional Value: Investors get exposure to Strategy’s core business and management expertise, not just the crypto asset. Long-Term Alignment: The 2065 pledge aligns management’s incentives with shareholders who believe in Bitcoin’s long-term future. Essentially, buying Strategy stock is a bet on both Bitcoin’s success and the company’s ability to manage that exposure wisely over time. The commitment to hold Bitcoin acts as a powerful anchor for that strategy. What Are the Risks of Such a Long-Term Bitcoin Hold? While bold, this strategy is not without significant challenges. Committing to an asset class as young and evolving as cryptocurrency for 40 years involves inherent risks. Technological Disruption: Could a new technology surpass Bitcoin? Regulatory Uncertainty: Long-term global regulatory frameworks are still undefined. Market Volatility: Extreme price swings could test the resolve of any holder. Execution Risk: The company must maintain its operational strength for decades to uphold this promise. However, by publicly stating its intent, Strategy is betting that these risks are outweighed by the potential reward. The move may encourage other corporations to consider similar long-term crypto strategies. Key Takeaways for Investors from This Bold Move Strategy’s announcement is more than a corporate headline; it’s a case study in conviction. For investors, it underscores several critical points. First, institutional adoption of Bitcoin is moving beyond speculation into strategic allocation. Second, having a clear, long-term plan is crucial when dealing with volatile assets. The decision to hold Bitcoin indefinitely removes the emotion of timing the market. Finally, it highlights the importance of choosing investment vehicles that match your belief in the asset’s timeline. In conclusion, Strategy CEO Phong Le’s pledge to hold Bitcoin until 2065 is a landmark moment of institutional confidence. It frames Bitcoin not as a passing trend, but as a foundational asset for the digital age. This long-term vision could inspire a new wave of corporate treasury strategies and reshape how all investors think about the time horizon for crypto investments. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q: Why 2065? Is that a specific target? A> The year 2065 is likely a symbolic date representing a commitment far beyond typical investment cycles, emphasizing a multi-generational hold rather than a precise target. Q: Does this mean Strategy will never sell any Bitcoin? A> The statement suggests a core, long-term holding strategy. The company may still manage the position tactically, but the intent is to maintain a significant Bitcoin treasury for decades. Q: How does this affect the price of Bitcoin? A> While one company’s strategy doesn’t directly control price, such strong, public conviction from a CEO can boost market sentiment and encourage other institutions to consider similar long-term holds. Q: Should I copy this strategy for my personal portfolio? A> Not necessarily. A corporate treasury strategy differs from personal investing. Always assess your own risk tolerance, timeline, and financial goals. Consider consulting a financial advisor. Q: What happens if Phong Le is no longer CEO? A> This is a key risk. The commitment is tied to current leadership. Future management could change the strategy, though such a public pledge creates expectations for continuity.

The broader crypto landscape remains sharply divided: some analysts argue that ETH and the rest of the market still face downward continuation, potentially setting new local lows, while others believe this correction is simply a reset before a much larger bull cycle—possibly extending into 2026. Related Reading: Bitcoin Must Break $97K To Restore Confidence Among Youngest Long-Term Holders – Details Yet one signal stands out clearly amid the noise: smart whales are unanimously going long on ETH. On-chain data shows that several of the most profitable and consistent whale traders—each with tens of millions in realized gains—have opened substantial long positions, collectively exceeding hundreds of millions of dollars. Their coordinated behavior indicates confidence that Ethereum’s recent lows represent opportunity rather than danger. This alignment among top-performing whales introduces a compelling counterpoint to bearish narratives. While retail sentiment remains fragile, the most sophisticated market participants appear to be positioning for a larger move ahead. As Ethereum stabilizes above $3,150, the question now becomes whether whale conviction will prove to be early—or correct. Top Performers Load Up on Ethereum According to Hyperdash data shared by Lookonchain, some of the most successful and influential whales in the market are aggressively accumulating Ethereum—sending a strong signal that high-conviction players expect upside ahead. One of the most notable is BitcoinOG, the trader widely recognized for shorting the market during the violent 10/10 crash, a move that earned him significant credibility. With a total realized PNL of $105 million, BitcoinOG is now positioned firmly on the bullish side, holding 54,277 ETH worth approximately $169.48 million. Another major player is the well-known Anti-CZ whale, named for his historical pattern of taking the opposite side of positions favored by Binance founder Changpeng Zhao. With an impressive $58.8 million in total PNL, this whale is currently long 62,156 ETH—a massive $194 million position. His trades have often been early indicators of broad market direction, adding weight to this shift toward bullish exposure. Finally, pension-usdt.eth, a consistently profitable whale address with $16.3 million in realized gains, is long 20,000 ETH valued at $62.5 million. Taken together, these positions reflect a unified stance among top-performing whales: despite market uncertainty, they are positioning for Ethereum strength. Related Reading: Ethereum Shows Signs Of Accumulation As CVD Strengthens And Correlation Stays Elevated Weekly Structure Shows Early Signs of Stabilization Ethereum’s weekly chart reveals a market attempting to regain its footing after a sharp multi-week decline from the $4,500 region. The recent reclaim of $3,150 is a meaningful development, as this level aligns closely with prior weekly support from mid-2024 and sits just above the 50-week moving average—an area that often acts as a trend-defining zone. ETH briefly dipped below this region during the November selloff, but buyers stepped in aggressively, producing a strong weekly wick that signals demand at lower levels. Despite this recovery attempt, ETH remains below key resistance levels. The 20-week and 100-week moving averages are positioned above the current price and converging, creating a zone of potential rejection unless momentum strengthens. For now, ETH is trading in a transitional structure: no longer trending downward aggressively, but not yet showing a confirmed bullish reversal on high timeframes. Related Reading: Ethereum NUPL Holds Steady, Signaling Market Balance Amid Volatility Volume patterns also support this interpretation. Selling volume has diminished compared to the capitulation phase, while recent green candles show moderate but steady buying interest—suggesting accumulation rather than full risk-on behavior. If ETH can establish consecutive weekly closes above $3,200–$3,300, the chart opens the door for a retest of the $3,600–$3,800 range. Failure to hold $3,150, however, risks another move toward $2,800 support.

According to the report, XRP is garnering institutional interest and demand on a global scale. While retail traders debate short-term price movements , smart money capital inflows into XRP are surpassing those of almost every other altcoin. XRP Dominates Institutional Inflows Across Europe And The Globe According to an X post by crypto expert Stern Drew, the latest WisdomTree report shows that XRP is the only digital asset attracting consistent institutional demand worldwide. In Europe, XRP has attracted over $549 million in new institutional capital this year, more than three times the inflows into Ethereum. This figure surpasses the total for every altcoin in the market and multi-asset products except Bitcoin. In a continent traditionally known for conservative investment strategies, these flows into XRP represent a decisive vote of confidence from European institutional investors . Drew has revealed that the demand for XRP has also extended beyond Europe. Outside the United States, XRP has captured roughly $252 million in fresh institutional capital just this year. By comparison, Bitcoin products absorbed only $268 million in smart money capital. Given that BTC products are more than 25 times the size of XRP products, this suggests that institutions have directed nearly 25 times more new capital into XRP than into Bitcoin. Drew has suggested that this increase in flows indicates careful, deliberate positioning rather than short-term speculative activity, which highlights the market’s growing preference for XRP . US Adoption Signals Broader Shift In his post, Drew also revealed the growing institutional interest in XRP within the US. This year, a new synthetic XRP product attracted $241 million, surpassing flows into Solana and all other altcoin products in the same category. This surge came at a time when the two largest cryptocurrencies, Bitcoin and Ethereum, collectively saw $6.4 billion exit their ETF structures . Drew revealed that the dramatic outflows from BTC and ETH signaled that institutional investors were diversifying from established assets while selectively accumulating XRP. The WisdomTree report also showed that, excluding Europe and the US, regions such as Asia and other global markets are increasing their exposure to XRP. Surprisingly, this surge in global institutional demand is occurring during periods of market stress rather than euphoric rallies. The XRP price is currently down by more than 15% this year and trading at just $2.1. The cryptocurrency has also been experiencing significant choppy action over the past few months, failing to reclaim former highs above $3. Despite this structural weakness, institutions continue to accumulate XRP in large quantities, indicating a clear bias toward the cryptocurrency. Drew has also revealed that smart money views XRP as a settlement-grade asset , well-suited for integration into the future architecture of regulated digital finance. He highlights that, as global institutional preference increasingly concentrates on XRP, price movements might follow later.",XRP|bitcoin|Ethereum|ripple|solana|Stern Drew|wisdomtree|XRP news|XRP price|XRPUSD|XRPUSDT,EN,0,0,BTC|ETH|MARKET|XRP|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-12-09 00:00:59

The regulator published its proposals on December 8, targeting improvements to how firms interact with experienced clients while simplifying the investment journey for ordinary consumers. The measures form part of efforts to bolster the UK's position as a leading financial hub and encourage greater participation in capital markets. The FCA's framework establishes distinct regulatory pathways for different investor categories. Professional investors will operate outside certain retail regulations, though the threshold for qualification remains deliberately stringent. Only individuals with substantial market experience, access to professional advice, or a genuine capacity to absorb investment losses will qualify for professional status. New Classification System Removes Arbitrary Barriers The current system relies on what regulators describe as arbitrary tests that fail to assess investor sophistication accurately. The revised approach places responsibility directly on firms to verify that clients genuinely meet professional standards before classification. Wealthy and experienced individuals gain access to a streamlined process for opting out of retail protections. Firms must obtain documented informed consent from clients choosing this route. The requirement ensures investors understand the protections they are waiving. Simon Walls, Executive Director of Markets at the FCA, stated that the changes aim to support an investment culture across all investor types. The framework provides retail customers with clearer information while giving professional markets defined boundaries based on contractual agreements and proportionate oversight. Professional investors will no longer face constraints such as the Consumer Duty, a regulation requiring firms to deliver good outcomes for retail clients. The exemption allows more flexible engagement between firms and sophisticated investors who can negotiate terms directly. Simplified Disclosure Requirements for Retail Investors The regulator is overhauling its communications with retail investors. Prescriptive templates inherited from European Union regulations will be replaced with a more flexible approach centered on Consumer Duty principles. Firms will gain freedom to design disclosures that effectively communicate investment risks, costs, and potential returns. The Consumer Composite Investments regime replaces the existing PRIIPs and UCITS frameworks, which consumers have historically found difficult to understand. The FCA has opened a consultation examining how regulation can better facilitate consumer access to investments. The review specifically considers expanding retail investor access to private markets, an asset class that has traditionally been reserved for institutional players. Britain faces challenges in encouraging investment participation. Recent research indicates 55 percent of adults remain unwilling to accept investment risks. This reluctance has significant economic implications. Analysis shows half of British household wealth outside pensions sits in property, while 15 percent of the population holds their savings in cash.

The conflict intensified when OKX announced on December 5 that it would terminate its service and migrate to a new platform by the end of December. MANTRA CEO JP Mullin claimed that the data is inaccurate and turns the process back to front, posing a risk that users will act on timelines that do not match Governance Proposal 26. Governance mismatch and conflicting dates The central issue is OKX’s assertion that the OM migration will occur between December 22 and December 25, 2025. According to MANTRA, the official governance proposal states that migration can only begin after the ERC-20 OM token has been fully deprecated. The deprecation deadline is January 15, 2026. On December 5, 2025, OKX published a statement entitled “OKX to support OM crypto migration”. This statement contained multiple factual errors and misrepresentations not present in official MANTRA governance proposals. We are incredibly concerned by this development, which shows… — JP Mullin (🕉, 🏘️) (@jp_mullin888) December 8, 2025 Proposal 26 also states that the migration date is conditional on the completion of additional technical review and does not assign any December dates to the conversion process. The project also pointed out that OKX had announced several dates in December that were not discussed with MANTRA , including trading services, deposits, withdrawals, and a December 22 snapshot. MANTRA claimed that no dates have been finalized regarding migration and emphasized that since April 13, the exchange has not communicated with the project regarding the specifics of migration. Exchange-imposed suspension schedule The December 5 announcement by OKX details significant changes to how OM trading will work. With OM, borrowing was to close on December 5, and between December 12 and December 19, the OM/USDT margin trading was to be suspended. OM-linked perpetual futures were to be delisted on December 15. Trading bots linked to the affected markets would gradually decrease in activity before each suspension. OM pairs were to be paused in the spot market between December 19 and 22, and OKX said that all deposits, withdrawals and transfers would end at 03:00 UTC on December 22. The user balance record was recorded at the same time, with OKX stating that the migration would continue until December 25. The exchange explained that no accounts with a balance below 10 OM would be converted and that only users with a KYC Level 2 or higher would be able to convert. During the migration period, OKX reported that information regarding OM valuation would be unavailable. MANTRA CEO advises users to retain direct custody Reacting to this, the MANTRA CEO encouraged users to take their OM out of OKX and migrate it through the official project channels as soon as the process becomes accessible. According to MANTRA, this method will ensure that their governance decisions are based on their own timeline, rather than an exchange-issued timeline, which aligns with Proposal 26. The team added that every other big exchange has been aligning their preparations with MANTRA, and that the only exchange to announce dates without liaising with the project was OKX. MANTRA further indicated that it is determined to work with all OM retail holders during the transition and will continue to collaborate with the exchanges to ensure that the migration process is accurate and consistent.

The regulator found X to be in violation of the EU’s digital regulations after a two-year investigation. US officials, including Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Vice President JD Vance, were also critical of the EU, claiming that the decision is an attack on American companies. Why did the EU fine Elon Musk’s company? Elon Musk’s social media platform, X, has been fined £120 million ($140 million) for breaching the European Union’s digital regulations. The Digital Services Act was adopted in 2022 to regulate online platforms, but this is the first time the EU has issued a non-compliance decision under its rules. The fine covers three main violations confirmed during the two-year investigation, including the deceptive design of X’s blue checkmark system, the lack of transparency in its advertising repository, and failure to provide access to public data for researchers. Before Musk acquired X in 2022, the platform was known as Twitter, and blue checkmarks were largely reserved for celebrities, politicians and influential accounts. After the purchase, the site started issuing badges to anyone willing to pay $8 per month. European regulators argue this system makes it difficult for users to judge the authenticity of accounts and exposes them to scams and impersonation fraud. The fine breaks down into £45 million for the blue checkmark issue, £35 million for the advertising repository problems, and £40 million for blocking researchers from accessing public data. X now has 60 days to inform the Commission how it will fix the blue checkmark issues and 90 days to submit plans for fixing its advertising repository and researcher access problems. Failure to comply could lead to additional periodic penalty payments. How are U.S. officials reacting to the fine? The U.S. Secretary of State, Marco Rubio, called the fine an attack on American tech platforms and the American people by foreign governments. Vice President JD Vance accused the Commission of seeking to fine X for not engaging in censorship. Musk initially simply reacted with a post on X saying that the decision was “bullshit.” By Saturday, he had a much bigger reaction, stating that the EU should be abolished and sovereignty should be returned to individual countries so that their governments can better represent the people. U.S. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick recently stated that the EU must revise its digital regulations to secure a deal for reducing its steel and aluminum tariffs. The Trump administration has consistently argued that the EU unfairly targets U.S. technology companies with severe financial penalties and burdensome regulations. The U.S. Ambassador to the EU, Andrew Puzder, said the fine, which was placed not just on X but on Musk himself, is an example of regulatory overreach targeting American innovation. European officials have denied the accusations so far. A Commission spokesman, Thomas Regnier, stated at a press conference that the EU is not targeting anyone based on their country of origin. Regnier also noted that Europe’s preference had not been to fine X. He explained that when companies engage constructively with the Commission, they prefer to settle cases, using TikTok as an example. Meta was recently found in breach of EU competition rules over its pay or consent system earlier this year and was fined £200 million.

Acting Chairman Caroline Pham said the initiative was intended to draw digital-asset activity into U.S.-regulated markets and to get away from using offshore trading platforms. Bitcoin , Ethereum, and USDC will be treated solely as collateral for the first three months. The program establishes guardrails for Futures Commission Merchants (FCMs) accepting digital assets, requiring them to report weekly and receive timely alerts of operational issues. The CFTC also guided the application of tokenized real-world assets, including Treasury securities and money-market funds, under its current regime, with a focus on custody, segregation, valuation, and operational risks, while maintaining technology-neutral regulations. In carrying out the pilot, CFTC suspended Staff Advisory 20-34, a 2020 memo that has excluded FCMs from accepting digital assets as collateral. The agency said advances in tokenization and the GENIUS Act had rendered the advisory obsolete. The GENIUS Act, passed in July, established a federal framework for non-securities digital assets and expanded the CFTC’s authority over both spot crypto markets and tokenized collateral. Coinbase’s chief legal officer, Paul Grewal, backed such a change, identifying the 2020 advisory as a “concrete ceiling on innovation” that went beyond regulatory limits and irritated the President’s Working Group on Digital Asset Markets. U.S. derivatives markets set to welcome institutional crypto activity The CFTC’s pilot program could have a ripple effect on the U.S. cryptocurrency market. Allowing tokenized assets, such as Bitcoin, Ethereum, and USDC, to serve as margin collateral may help increase the liquidity of derivatives markets and attract new institutional investors who currently avoid U.S.-regulated platforms due to stringent regulations. Improved inclusion by these investors may lead to reduced dependence on offshore exchanges, thereby increasing the number of trades and the capital raised under U.S. regulatory oversight. Analysts suggest that adding tokenized collateral could also stabilize the market through standardized reporting and operational safeguards – something that could help mitigate the kind of volatility seen in the digital asset space. The pilot also indicates regulators are starting to come to terms with digital financial innovation, setting the stage for more crypto firms to do business in the U.S. rather than overseas. Broadly speaking, the program represents a significant step toward bridging the gap between traditional finance and digital asset markets. Spot crypto trading debuts on CFTC-registered exchanges The pilot is a few days after the CFTC approved spot crypto trading on CFTC-registered exchanges for the first time, a step Pham called unprecedented. Bitnomial exchange in Chicago, which is regulated as a derivatives venue, is now scheduled to launch leveraged spot trading, with its existing futures and options products, this week. The U.S. derivatives watchdog regulates the exchange as a designated contract market (DCM). This means that the new activity will be launching in a fully regulated space, following strong encouragement from the federal agency, including direct meetings with Acting Chairman Caroline Pham to help expedite the process during the prolonged federal government shutdown. “Recent events on offshore exchanges have shown us how essential it is for Americans to have more choice and access to safe, regulated U.S. markets,” Pham said in a statement. “Now, for the first time ever, spot crypto can trade on CFTC-registered exchanges that have been the gold standard for nearly a hundred years, with the customer protections and market integrity that Americans deserve.” The step, which Pham referred to as a “historic milestone,” tracks recommendations from the President’s Working Group on Digital Asset Markets, which issued a report this year outlining a crypto agenda for U.S. regulators. Pham noted the CFTC is “finally using our decades-long existing authority” to initiate this trading. Don’t just read crypto news. Understand it. Subscribe to our newsletter.

The Crypto Fear & Greed Index has frozen at a reading of 22, firmly planting the market in ‘extreme fear’ territory. This crucial sentiment gauge, a favorite among traders and analysts, suggests investor anxiety is running high. But what does this persistent fear actually signal, and more importantly, how should you navigate it? Let’s break down the numbers and the psychology behind them. What is the Crypto Fear & Greed Index Telling Us Right Now? The Crypto Fear & Greed Index is more than just a number. Compiled by Alternative.me, it acts as the market’s emotional pulse check. A score of 22, unchanged from the previous day, is a clear signal. The scale runs from 0 (extreme fear) to 100 (extreme greed). Therefore, hovering just above 20 indicates a market gripped by significant pessimism and caution. This isn’t a fleeting moment of doubt; it’s a sustained state of worry that influences trading decisions across the board. How is the Fear & Greed Index Calculated? This index doesn’t rely on gut feeling. It uses a data-driven formula to quantify the market’s mood. Understanding its components helps explain why the reading is so low: Volatility (25%): Sharp price swings, especially downward, increase fear. Market Volume (25%): High sell-off volume versus buying volume points to panic. Social Media (15%): The tone of conversations on platforms like Twitter and Reddit. Surveys (15%): Direct sentiment polls from the community. Bitcoin Dominance (10%): A shift to Bitcoin can signal a ‘flight to safety’. Google Trends (10%): Search volume for negative or positive terms. The current Crypto Fear & Greed Index score suggests these factors are collectively painting a bleak picture. Is Extreme Fear a Bad Sign or a Hidden Opportunity? This is the critical question for every investor. Historically, the Crypto Fear & Greed Index has been a powerful contrarian indicator. Periods of ‘extreme fear’ have often preceded major market bottoms and buying opportunities. Why? Because when everyone is selling in panic, assets can become undervalued. However, ‘extreme fear’ can also precede further declines if the underlying market issues are severe. The key is to differentiate between irrational panic and justified caution based on fundamental problems. Actionable Insights for Trading in a Fearful Market Navigating a market with a low Crypto Fear & Greed Index requires a cool head and a clear strategy. Here are some steps to consider: Do Not Panic Sell: Selling at the peak of fear often locks in losses. Review Your Portfolio: Assess which assets have strong fundamentals versus those driven purely by hype. Consider Dollar-Cost Averaging (DCA): This strategy involves buying fixed amounts at regular intervals, which can be effective in volatile, fearful markets. Set Clear Limits: Define your risk tolerance and set stop-loss orders if necessary to manage downside. Use the Index as a Gauge, Not a Gospel: It’s one tool among many. Combine it with technical and fundamental analysis. The Psychological Battle: Mastering Your Own Fear & Greed The most important chart isn’t on your screen; it’s in your mind. A low Crypto Fear & Greed Index often triggers our own worst instincts—the urge to follow the herd off a cliff. Successful investors learn to recognize these emotional triggers. They understand that market sentiment is cyclical. The extreme fear of today will eventually give way to optimism, and later, potentially to extreme greed. Your goal is not to time these cycles perfectly but to avoid making catastrophic decisions at the emotional extremes. In conclusion, the Crypto Fear & Greed Index holding at 22 is a stark reminder of the market’s current nervous disposition. It reflects real data from volatility, volume, and social sentiment. While it signals caution, history teaches us that such pervasive fear can also seed the next opportunity. The wisest approach is to stay informed, stick to your long-term strategy, and remember that in the chaotic world of crypto, sometimes the best move is to simply not make a move driven by panic. Use this period of fear to conduct thorough research and prepare for the market’s next phase. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q: What does a Crypto Fear & Greed Index score of 22 mean?

Have you noticed subtle shifts in the cryptocurrency market lately? The latest data reveals a fascinating development: the Altcoin Season Index has edged up to 19. This single-point movement might seem small, but for seasoned traders, it represents a potential early signal of changing market dynamics. Let’s explore what this means for your portfolio and whether we’re witnessing the beginning of a broader trend. What Exactly Is the Altcoin Season Index? CoinMarketCap’s Altcoin Season Index serves as a crucial market health indicator. The calculation is straightforward yet powerful: it compares the price performance of the top 100 cryptocurrencies (excluding stablecoins and wrapped coins) against Bitcoin over a 90-day period. When 75% of these altcoins outperform Bitcoin during this window, the market officially enters an “altcoin season.” Think of it as a market thermometer. A score closer to 100 indicates strong altcoin dominance, while lower scores suggest Bitcoin is leading the charge. The current reading of 19 represents a one-point increase from the previous day, moving the needle slightly toward potential altcoin strength. Why Should You Care About This Movement? Even a modest shift in the Altcoin Season Index matters because it reflects changing investor sentiment and capital flows. Here’s what this movement potentially signals: Early Rotation Signs: Money might be starting to flow from Bitcoin into alternative cryptocurrencies Risk Appetite Change: Investors could be becoming more comfortable with altcoin volatility Market Diversification: The crypto ecosystem may be broadening beyond Bitcoin dominance However, remember that we’re still far from the 75 threshold that defines a true altcoin season. This movement represents early-stage interest rather than confirmed trend reversal. How Does This Compare to Previous Market Cycles? Historical context helps us understand the significance of the current Altcoin Season Index reading. During major altcoin seasons, the index has consistently remained above 75 for extended periods. The current level of 19 indicates we’re in what many analysts call a “Bitcoin season” or transition phase. Previous cycles show that sustained movement above 50 often precedes stronger altcoin performance. Therefore, while the current reading remains low, the upward direction bears watching. The key question becomes: will this momentum continue, or is it just temporary market noise? What Actionable Insights Can You Take Away? Monitoring the Altcoin Season Index provides valuable information for your investment strategy. Here are practical ways to use this data: Watch for Consistency: Look for sustained upward movement rather than one-day spikes Combine with Other Indicators: Use the index alongside trading volume and market sentiment data Set Alert Levels: Consider establishing watch points at key levels like 25, 50, and 75 Review Your Portfolio: Assess whether your current allocation matches market conditions Remember that no single indicator should dictate your entire strategy. The Altcoin Season Index works best when combined with fundamental analysis and risk management principles. What’s the Current Market Reality? Despite the slight increase in the Altcoin Season Index , Bitcoin continues to dominate market conversations and capital. The cryptocurrency landscape remains heavily influenced by Bitcoin’s price movements and institutional adoption news. Many altcoins still move in correlation with Bitcoin, though decoupling events become more frequent as the index rises. The journey from 19 to 75 represents significant market evolution. It requires sustained altcoin outperformance across multiple sectors and projects. While some individual altcoins may shine, true season declaration demands broad-based strength. Conclusion: Reading Between the Numbers The Altcoin Season Index movement to 19 offers a glimpse into potential market evolution. While far from signaling a full altcoin season, this upward tick suggests increasing attention toward alternative cryptocurrencies. Savvy investors will monitor this trend while maintaining balanced perspectives on both Bitcoin and altcoin opportunities. The cryptocurrency market thrives on rotation and innovation. Today’s slight index movement could be tomorrow’s significant trend. Stay informed, stay diversified, and remember that understanding indicators like the Altcoin Season Index helps you navigate market transitions with greater confidence. Frequently Asked Questions What does an Altcoin Season Index of 19 mean? An index reading of 19 means that only a small percentage of top altcoins have outperformed Bitcoin over the past 90 days. We remain firmly in Bitcoin-dominant territory, though the upward movement suggests potential early interest in altcoins. How often does the Altcoin Season Index update? The index updates daily, providing regular snapshots of market rotation between Bitcoin and altcoins. This frequency helps traders spot emerging trends more quickly. Can the Altcoin Season Index predict price movements? While not a direct price predictor, the index reflects market sentiment and capital flows. Sustained movements often correlate with broader market trends, making it a valuable sentiment indicator. What happens when the index reaches 75? When the index sustains a reading of 75 or higher, it signals an official “altcoin season.” This means at least 75% of top altcoins have outperformed Bitcoin over the previous 90-day period. Should I buy altcoins when the index rises? Index movements should inform but not dictate investment decisions. Consider the index as one data point among many, and always conduct thorough research before making investment choices. How reliable is the Altcoin Season Index? The index has proven historically reliable for identifying market phases. However, like all indicators, it works best when combined with other analysis methods and should not be used in isolation.

As the development progress gets significant revisions and as the distribution of funds tightens, it can be considered that Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is getting into the spotlight of the conversation regarding being one of the most popular top cryptos below $0.05. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is developing a decentralized lending platform that will have a Peer to Contract and a Peer to Peers environment. Users in the P2C model are lending out assets like ETH or USDT and obtain mtTokens. Such mtTokens increase in value with the payment of interest by borrowers. With borrowing in the P2P environment, the interest rates vary with liquidity, the loan to value policies regulate the safe borrowing habits. Liquidation can be done in case the collateral is overly low. Liquidators cover some amount of debt and seize discounted collateral. Such an orderly structure is a strong contrast to the 2021 rise of SHIB, based on the sentiment, social trends and speculation. Mutuum Finance is also being characterized as a utility new crypto, and some investors think that this puts it in a better position to outperform meme assets over the long-term. Presale Growth, Metrics and Early Price Action Mutuum Finance started off in early 2025 at the price of $0.01. The token is currently trading at $0.035, which is 250% up in development. The project has also attracted more than 18,400 holders with a value of $19.2M. Over 810M MUTM tokens were already sold. The total token supply is 4B. Of these 1.82B tokens, which is equivalent to 45.5% are being allocated towards presale phases. Phase 6 has now penetrated beyond 95%, and there is only a small number of tokens at the present price. The official listing price is $0.06 which has also contributed towards accelerating participation since the distance between the two prices becomes difficult to overlook. Mutuum Finance also has a 24 hour leaderboard where the best user wins $500 worth of MUTM every day. This has contributed to continuous day-to-day interaction and presence in various parts of the world. Onboarding has also been made easy thanks to card payment access, not to mention that it has made it easy to participate in DeFi even among new participants. V1 Schedule, Security Stack and Analyst Expectations On its official X account, Mutuum Finance has confirmed that the V1 testnet will be deployed in Q4 2025. V1 will bring the lending pool, the mtTokens, the liquidation instruments and the debt-tracking module. Launched with support of ETH and USDT. This is the next milestone that is likely to attract new users with the protocol nearing operation into live mode. The role of security work has also contributed significantly to the establishment of trust on the project. Mutuum Finance has also been CertiK audited (Score: 90/100) on the Token Scan. Halborn Security is making checks on the lending contracts to ascertain that they are behaving per the actual circumstances. There is also a $50,000 bug bounty that runs the project, in order to fix the issues before the release of V1. The initial growth models emphasize that protocol-related yield, repurchase and scalability lending mechanisms can result in the token outperforming regular meme-based assets. A number of analyst forecasts currently place MUTM in a 5x to 7x band following V1 activation should there be an increase in borrowing demand. Layer-2 Scaling Mutuum Finance will establish a USD-pegged interest-backed stablecoin, according to the official roadmap. Stablecoins commonly become integrated in the lending ecosystem since it can ensure predictable borrowing and amplify liquidity. This acquisition should contribute towards the growth of the platform. The project will also be deployed in a variety of layer-2 networks. L2 support is accompanied by reduced fees and increased coverage and this is quite critical in the lending markets where collateral updates, interest and liquidation updates are frequent. L2 activities can also spur growth and reinforce greater liquidity. Chainlink feeds will be used as the primary oracle layer in the protocol. Other inputs on pricing will avoid the errors of liquidation. Precise pricing belongs to the most significant aspects of the lending platforms, which is why this arrangement is critical towards long-term viability. With such features put together, certain long term models have depicted a possibility of 800% upside potential over the next crypto cycles. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has surged 250%, raised 19.2M, higher than 18,400 holders and about to complete Phase 6 with an allotment of above 95%. Since V1 is planned to be activated in Q4, audited contracts, mtToken yield, buy pressure, stablecoin development, oracle protection and layer-2 planning, the project is accelerating much more rapidly than many pre-staged tokens. Maps of possible future investors who are tracking the next crypto opportunities believe that Mutuum Finance can now be one of the most powerful early arrangements going into 2026 as it starts to demand more and the remaining tokens at $0.035 are erased.

Released by the Trump administration, the document outlines the nation’s long-term security priorities and technological ambitions, yet its silence on crypto stands in contrast with both market momentum and recent political statements. As global financial systems increasingly integrate digital assets, many observers see the absence as a signal of policy uncertainty at a time when regulatory clarity is becoming more important for industry growth. Why Has AI Taken the Spotlight Across its 33 pages , the strategy places artificial intelligence, biotechnology, and quantum computing at the center of America’s next-generation competition. The administration states that U.S. technology and standards must “drive the world forward,” underscoring a focus on advanced computing rather than decentralized finance. Digital assets, which had gained prominence through previous remarks from officials, receive no explicit mention. This stands at odds with comments from President Trump in recent months. In a CBS 60 Minutes interview, he warned that China should not become the global leader in virtual assets and insisted that Bitcoin mining should remain within U.S. borders. A Subtle Reference, but No Clear Policy While crypto is not named in the strategy, the document does reference strengthening American “leadership in digital finance and innovation.” Analysts view this as a broad gesture rather than a firm policy direction, but it leaves open the possibility that digital assets may still influence future regulatory or economic strategies. This ambiguity comes despite a year of significant pro-crypto actions. Measures such as the GENIUS Act for stablecoin oversight , the formation of a crypto enforcement task force, reduced regulatory pressures on exchanges, and opposition to a central bank digital currency have all shaped expectations. The establishment of a national Bitcoin reserve, funded through forfeited digital assets, further signals that crypto remains a strategic consideration even if not formally acknowledged in the latest blueprint. Market Response and Broader Implications Currently trading around $91,900, Bitcoin briefly fell below $90,000 following the release of the strategy, a move compounded by broader macroeconomic pressures and anticipation of a Federal Reserve rate decision. The administration’s call for increased defense spending among NATO allies has also raised questions about inflation and monetary policy, factors that could influence investor appetite for digital assets. For now, the omission leaves the industry navigating a familiar gap of strong political rhetoric, scattered policy initiatives, but no comprehensive framework. As the U.S. centers its priorities around AI and quantum computing, crypto’s position in national strategy remains undefined. Is this the end of the ‘Crypto Administration’?

The mix of heavy buying by public firms and signs of miner strain is drawing attention from both bulls and bears.

The chart lists an average purchase price of $74,436 and shows 88 confirmed buy events over time. Saylor captioned the image “Back to Orange Dots?” — a short, familiar cue that has often come before a new accumulation round. Strategy’s most recent reported move was a 130 BTC buy, which fits the company’s long habit of adding during periods of market fear. That pattern matters because when an entity repeatedly buys through downswings, it shapes how other investors react. ₿ack to Orange Dots? pic.twitter.com/npB0NWSZ52 — Michael Saylor (@saylor) December 7, 2025 Corporate Buying Continues Based on reports from BitcoinTreasuries.NET, the top 100 public firms now hold about 1,059,453 BTC combined. ABTC reportedly added 363 BTC, the largest increase this week, while Cango Inc. purchased 130.6 BTC. Other names cited in recent filings include Bitdeer, BitFuFu, Hyperscale Data, Genius Group, and Bitcoin Hodl Co. These moves show that some companies keep expanding reserves even when prices wobble. For market watchers, steady corporate accumulation can be a calming force, though it does not erase broader sell pressure. On-Chain Stress Indicators According to Glassnode charts shared by the Bitcoin Archive, the Hash Ribbon has shifted bearish again, a sign that some miners are facing stress or even pausing operations. Short-Term Holder NUPL has fallen below zero, meaning many recent buyers are holding coins at a loss. Historically, episodes where miners are squeezed at the same time new holders are underwater have appeared near significant lows. That outcome is not certain, but the combination of technical miner strain and unrealized losses among short-term wallets is the kind of setup traders watch closely.

Some expect that corporate purchases and purchases by Strategy could blunt downside and spark a rebound. Others remain cautious because on-chain indicators point to real strain. Market action around major events, like central bank announcements, has also shown Bitcoin can stall before policy moves and then move sharply after.

With negotiations stalled and key disagreements unresolved, the future of a clear legal framework for cryptocurrencies in the United States hangs in the balance. This deadlock creates immense uncertainty for businesses and investors alike. Why Has Crypto Regulation Stalled in Congress? According to Senator Moreno, speaking at a Blockchain Association policy summit, the path to a bipartisan crypto regulation bill is currently blocked by fundamental disagreements. While the U.S. managed to pass the narrower GENIUS Act for stablecoins last summer, efforts for a broader, more comprehensive law have ground to a halt. The senator emphasized a firm stance, stating he would rather have no agreement than a bad one, refusing to include problematic provisions just for the sake of passing a bill. The core issues causing this impasse are not simple. They strike at the heart of how the U.S. government views and manages digital assets. The lack of progress leaves a regulatory gray area that many argue stifles innovation and fails to protect consumers. The Major Roadblocks to Agreement So, what are the specific hurdles preventing a deal on crypto regulation ? The negotiations have stumbled over two primary, and deeply complex, challenges: The SEC vs. CFTC Turf War: A major sticking point is defining the jurisdictional boundaries between the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC). Lawmakers must decide which agency gets primary oversight over different types of digital assets—a decision with huge implications for the industry. Consumer Protection Provisions: Crafting rules that adequately protect investors from fraud and market manipulation without being so restrictive that they crush legitimate innovation is a delicate balancing act. Agreeing on the specifics of these provisions has proven difficult. These are not minor technical details. They are foundational questions that will shape the U.S. crypto landscape for decades. Resolving them requires compromise from both political parties and regulatory bodies with sometimes competing philosophies. What’s Next for US Crypto Policy? Despite the current stalemate, the conversation is not over. Republicans and Democrats are scheduled to meet again to continue discussions. The question remains: can they bridge the gap? The outcome of these talks will determine whether the U.S. embraces a leadership role in the digital economy or continues with a patchwork of state rules and aggressive enforcement actions. The delay in federal crypto regulation has real-world consequences. It creates uncertainty for companies deciding where to base their operations and leaves everyday investors without clear protections. Many industry advocates warn that the United States risks falling behind other nations that are moving more swiftly to establish clear rules. The Final Verdict on the Regulatory Impasse The admission by Senator Moreno that crypto regulation talks have stalled is a pivotal moment. It highlights the profound challenges of governing a fast-evolving technological frontier with traditional political and regulatory tools. While the desire for a “no bad deal” is principled, the ongoing vacuum carries its own risks. The coming weeks will be critical as lawmakers reconvene, facing pressure from both an eager industry and a concerned public to find a viable path forward. The dream of comprehensive, clear crypto regulation remains alive, but its path through Congress is now fraught with significant obstacles. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What did Senator Bernie Moreno say about crypto regulation? A1: Senator Moreno stated that negotiations for a comprehensive crypto regulation bill in Congress have stalled due to key disagreements, primarily over SEC/CFTC jurisdiction and consumer protection rules. He expressed a preference for no deal over a bad one. Q2: What is the GENIUS Act? A2: The GENIUS Act is a U.S. law passed in the summer of 2023 that specifically regulates stablecoins—a type of cryptocurrency pegged to a stable asset like the U.S. dollar. The current stalled talks concern a much broader regulatory framework. Q3: Why is defining SEC vs. CFTC jurisdiction so important? A3: It’s crucial because the SEC regulates securities (investments), while the CFTC regulates commodities (like goods and futures). How a cryptocurrency is classified determines which rules apply, impacting everything from trading to disclosure requirements for companies. Q4: What happens if Congress can’t agree on crypto regulation? A4: Without federal legislation, the current state of regulatory uncertainty continues. This likely means more enforcement actions by the SEC and CFTC based on existing laws, a patchwork of state-level regulations, and continued legal ambiguity for businesses and investors. Q5: Are there any upcoming meetings about this? A5: Yes. According to reports, Republicans and Democrats in Congress are scheduled to meet on December 9th to continue discussions on the stalled crypto regulation bill. Q6: How does this stalemate affect the average crypto user? A6: It prolongs uncertainty. Users may face unclear tax reporting guidelines, inconsistent protections across different platforms, and a U.S. crypto industry that is hesitant to innovate or offer new services due to the lack of regulatory clarity.
