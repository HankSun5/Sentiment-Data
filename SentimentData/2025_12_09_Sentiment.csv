The company currently sits on a paper loss of $158 million, with the company also set to acquire Semler Scientific to expand its portfolio of Bitcoin. Holders of the Variable Rate Series A Perpetual Preferreds are set to see their distributions reduced from next year. These currently have a 13% current yield. Strive Asset Management, LLC ( ASST ) offers a jumbled and, in my opinion, currently hard to invest in Bitcoin (BTC-USD) as a treasury business strategy that aimed to ride the bandwagon established by Strategy ( MSTR ) but faces headwinds from elevated financing costs and a constrained premium to its BTC holdings. The company owned 7,525 BTC as of its most recent purchase of the cryptocurrency, with this bought at an average price of $113,383 per BTC for an aggregate nominal amount of $853.21 million. With BTC currently valued at $92,438, around $695 million in aggregate, ASST sits on a significant paper loss of around $158 million. While bulls would be right to highlight a market cap of $859 million puts ASST's mNAV at a decent 1.24x, this is far below MSTR's premium that was well north of 2x before the recent BTC dip. BTC as a treasury is anchored on constant access to the capital market to raise funds recycled into buying BTC. ASST needs to be able to continually sell its common equity to achieve this, but would see its BTC per share come in at a materially lower clip in the event its mNAV continues to narrow. Strive ASST's philosophy in a crowded marketplace of global BTC treasury companies is to focus on BTC per share and use the cryptocurrency as its hurdle rate for deploying capital. The hurdle rate is a term mainly used in private equity that describes the minimum rate of return required on an investment. ASST, which is the 14th largest publicly listed BTC as a treasury company, is likely describing a policy to BTC purchasing policy that limits new buys on pre-determined BTC per share metrics. The company is young, only going public in September through a merger with Asset Entities. ASST has since gone on to engineer an all-stock acquisition of Semler Scientific ( SMLR ). The deal would see ASST pay SMLR $90.52 per share, which represented a 210% premium at the time the acquisition was announced. Strive Website The Variable Rate Preferreds, Semler Scientific, Liquidity, And Cash Burn SMLR is currently trading for $20.33 per share at a $310 million market capitalization. It also currently owns 5,048 BTC, valued at $467 million. The clear mismatch between SMLR's current market cap, the implied acquisition market cap at $1.38 billion, and the value of SMLR's BTC holdings reflects the upside-down nature of the deal. The overall BTC as a treasury strategy depends on the constant tapping of investor euphoria to issue shares at a strong premium to buy BTC. The mismatch reflects the sustained pullback of BTC since the deal was announced, and a likelihood that the deal will be significantly altered. It simply does not make sense for ASST to pay $1.38 billion for BTC that's valued at less than half of this amount. It's entirely against ASST's own philosophy to focus on BTC per share, as they could just sell half the amount of shares they would need to exchange for the acquisition and own more BTC at current prices. For investors looking for BTC exposure, it won't make sense to pay such a premium when direct ownership or the use of an ETF would net more BTC. QuantumOnline ASST currently has a Variable Rate Series A Perpetual Preferred Stock ( SATA ) outstanding. These started trading shortly after the firm's IPO and is set to be used along with a $450 million at-the-market (""ATM"") common stock offering shelf, and cash and cash equivalents on its balance sheet of $109 million as of the end of the fiscal 2025 third quarter to buy BTC. There were 2 million shares of SATA offered, upsized by 750,000 shares from the prior announcement, with the shares sold for $80 per share for gross proceeds of $160 million. The preferreds currently pay a $12 annual coupon , in monthly distributions, for a 13% current yield as they're currently swapping hands for $91.61 per share. QuantumOnline Further, as they're perpetual, ASST is under no obligation to redeem these at any point. They have a $100 per share liquidation value, so they're currently trading hands at an 8.4% discount to this. This works for investors looking for a forever income security, but in aggregate with the unique variable terms of the preferreds, raises significant risk that ASST will face headwinds in making what's currently a $24 million per year coupon payment. ASST needs constant access to the capital markets to be able to copy the MSTR strategy, so the use of monthly distributions and selling the preferreds at a discount was meant as sweeteners to get investors on board with the offering. Seeking Alpha ASST can start reducing the variable payments from three months after its IPO. This is limited to the aggregate of 25 basis points and the excess of one-month term SOFR on the first business day of the relevant distribution, over the minimum of the one-month term SOFR from the previous distribution period. As ASST pays out monthly, this implies that it can, from the first quarter of next year, reduce the distribution on the preferreds by at least 25 basis points per month, around 300 basis points per year. This would compress its coupon rate from 12% to 9% over 12 months at a minimum, lower than the 10% MSTR pays to the holders of some of its preferreds. SATA is up from its IPO as they were sold at such a steep discount, but the December Fed rate cut, in aggregate with a weak BTC price and the eventual 3-month hurdle, is likely set to see these trade lower. Cash flow from operations was $22.1 million during the third quarter, with ASST's cash balance set to cover this rate of operational cash burn by just under 5 quarters. However, the company maintains access to capital markets with an ongoing ATM program and can tap its BTC holdings for sales to meet its operational cash burn needs and extend its cash runway. Conclusion ASST's BTC holdings are upside-down, trading at a significant loss to its average buy price, just as its stock continues to dip. This is now down 92.4% from their 52-week-high. There are now far too many BTC as treasury companies available to investors to buy, with the list north of 100, not including the ETFs.

As the top meme coin bounces off a key support, could this favor a bullish Dogecoin price prediction ? According to data from BitInfoCharts, the number of daily active addresses (DAAs) within the Dogecoin blockchain spiked to its second highest level in three months on December 3 at 67,511. The highest reading during this period occurred on September 15, back when DOGE hit a local top of $0.30 and started retreating to its current levels. What this metric may have indicated back then is that a significant number of wallets were both buying and selling, as the price hit a high level. This time, following a 50% retreat from those highs, this could be evidence that this is a highly contested area for both bulls and bears again. Interestingly, DOGE has gone up by 3.5% in the past 24 hours and currently stands at $0.14. This has been a key area of support for the token from which it has bounced three times already. Trading volumes have more than doubled, further confirming that buying pressure is increasing rapidly. Paired with higher wallet usage, could Dogecoin be getting ready to reverse its downtrend? Dogecoin Price Prediction: Key Levels to Watch as $0.14 Holds Strong Dogecoin has gone up today, and trading volumes are accompanying the move as the token bounces from the $0.14 level. Source: TradingView The pivotal area for DOGE is the $0.16 mark, as a move above this area would confirm a trend reversal and finally break the token’s bearish structure. The first and most likely target if this happens would be the 200-day exponential moving average (EMA), as this is typically a high-volume price zone. Meanwhile, a bullish breakout above this key line would confirm a positive mid-term outlook for Dogecoin. If that’s the case, we could see the token spiking back to its September 2025 levels, back when daily active addresses reached their 3-month peak. This week is critical for the markets as the Federal Reserve will convene on Wednesday to make a decision on interest rates. A rate cut could be exactly what the market needs to propel crypto prices back to their recent highs . As the meme coin market gears up for a potential breakout, all eyes are shifting to early-stage presales with the highest upside. Maxi Doge ($MAXI) is one of the most talked-about presales in the space right now, and with momentum building fast, it could be the next major gainer once listings go live. Maxi Doge ($MAXI) Raises Over $4 Million Despite the Market’s Turmoil The latest wave of selling has not deterred investors from piling into Maxi Doge ($MAXI) . This new meme coin embodies the hype that comes with bull markets and aims to build a thriving community of ‘degen’ traders who love taking big risks in exchange for big gains.

After months of sustained selling pressure and increased whale activity, the market is now watching whether Solana can hold its recent gains or slip back toward lower support zones. Related Reading: What’s Happening With XRP And Why Did Its Spot ETF Crash 20%? This comes at a time when analysts, on-chain trackers, and market participants are also assessing the broader influence of KOL (Key Opinion Leader) predictions, many of which have dramatically misaligned with Solana’s actual price trajectory over the past two months. SOL's price sees some small gains on the daily chart. Source: SOLUSD on Tradingview Solana Price Stalls Below Key Resistance SOL is currently trading just under $138 after a modest recovery from the $128 low. Technical data indicates that the Solana price is struggling beneath a dense cluster of moving averages, with the 20-day EMA at $138 repeatedly rejecting upward attempts. The intraday structure remains corrective, as rallies tend to fade before gaining traction. A sustained close above $140 remains the key threshold. Clearing it could open immediate targets near $142 and later $150. However, failure at this level risks renewed pullbacks toward $132, and deeper weakness could revisit $128 region. Short-term indicators offer mixed signals. The hourly RSI remains above 50, while the MACD leans slightly bullish, suggesting that momentum exists but lacks conviction. KOL Predictions Scrutinized as Market Cap Declines Solana’s market cap has fallen roughly 40.5% over the past two months, contradicting bullish influencer claims made earlier in the quarter. Data from Santiment shows how traders predict a near-term all-time high, only for SOL to continue its downward slide. This divergence is leading analysts to lean more heavily on tools like the KOLs_Tracker, which ranks influencer performance and helps identify when certain calls may function as contrarian signals. The gap between predictions and actual performance has added an extra layer of volatility to Solana’s narrative, as traders use social sentiment data alongside traditional indicators to gauge market direction. With network activity and flows still subdued, traders are approaching such predictions with increased caution. Liquidity Shifts Highlight Whale Influence On-chain activity shows notable movement from large holders, including a whale that recently transferred 100,000 SOL to Binance, part of a broader trend that has seen over 600,000 SOL moved to exchanges since April. While not enough to move the market on its own, such consistent selling reinforces resistance zones and limits recovery momentum. The address still holds more than 700,000 SOL, meaning additional liquidity could enter the market if the Solana price approaches previously favored selling levels. Related Reading: Ethereum Founder Breaks Silence With Major Upgrade Proposal As the Solana price deals with this tight range, market participants remain focused on whether buyers can establish a base above $138–$140. Until then, resistance remains firm, sentiment remains cautious, and the path forward depends on both technical confirmation and the broader crypto market direction.

Speaking at the Bitcoin MENA event in Abu Dhabi, Saylor suggested countries could use overcollateralized Bitcoin reserves and tokenized credit assets to launch regulated digital bank accounts that offer higher yields than traditional deposits. Saylor’s comments come as the CEOs of Citigroup, Wells Fargo, and Bank of America are scheduled to meet with both Republican and Democratic senators this week to discuss legislation focused on crypto market structure. As earlier reported by Cryptopolitan , Bank executives and U.S. senators are expected to gather on Thursday at the Financial Services Forum, a bank trade group that is organizing the meeting. “The meeting is another opportunity to share [the banks’] perspectives and serve as constructive partners in crafting smart policy to ensure the U.S. remains a digital assets leader,” a spokesperson for FSF said. Topics that are priority to cover include bank permissibility, as well as payment of interest and illicit finance, the spokesperson noted, adding that “meetings between our CEOs and lawmakers happen often.” Saylor underscored the motivation behind his proposal by pointing to low global yields. Bank deposits in Japan, Europe, and Switzerland provide little to no yield, Saylor pointed out, while euro money-market funds yield around 150 basis points, and US money-market rates remain closer to 400 basis points. This, he added, is why investors resort to the corporate bond market, which “wouldn’t exist if people weren’t so disgusted with their bank account.” New framework proposes overcollateralized BTC reserves Saylor described a framework in which digital credit products comprise approximately 80% of a fund, with another 20% in fiat currencies , and a 10% reserve buffer built on top to mitigate excess volatility. If such a product were available on a regulated bank’s platform, depositors could place billions of dollars in institutions to obtain larger deposits. The account would be backed by digital credit with 5:1 overcollateralization held by a treasury body, he added. In Saylor’s view, the country offering such accounts may attract “20 trillion or 50 trillion dollars” in additional capital flows. The CEO suggested that a country adopting this line could become the international “digital banking capital of the world.” The comments followed Saylor’s revelation on X that the company had purchased 10,624 BTC for roughly $962.7 million the previous week. The latest buy increases Strategy’s ownership of the asset to 660,624 BTC, purchased for about $49.35 billion at an average cost of $74,696. Saylor’s description of a high-yield, low-volatility digital bank product is reminiscent of some of what Strategy sells. In July, the company debuted STRC, a money-market-style preferred share with a variable dividend rate of around 10% and a structure designed to maintain its price near par while being backed by Strategy’s Bitcoin-linked treasury operations. Although the product has already grown to around $2.9 billion in market cap, it has also been met with some skepticism. Critics question volatility risks as Saylor expands BTC holdings Bitcoin’s volatility is one reason some observers question Saylor’s push for Bitcoin-backed, high-yield credit instruments. Bitcoin has delivered strong long-term returns, but its short-term performance remains unpredictable. Although the product has already reached a market capitalization of around $2.9 billion, it has also faced some skepticism. And Bitcoin’s volatility is one reason some people wonder whether Saylor’s push toward Bitcoin-backed credit instruments, with high yields, is too big a stretch. So far, Bitcoin has posted strong long-term returns, but it doesn’t give much insight into its immediate performance. Bitcoin has been trading at around $90,911 as of the time of this post, roughly 28% less than its record high of $126,080 on Oct. 6, and approximately 9% less over the past 12 months, according to CoinGecko. However, over five years, BTC has increased by 1,155% from $7,193 on January 1, 2020. During October, a former Salomon Brothers bond and derivatives trader, Josh Man, called Saylor’s moves “folly” and suggested STRC could suffer a liquidity event. He wrote: “The fiat banking system has been around a long time and has figured out how to build a moat around demand deposits so that they don’t break the buck. Hiking rates on STRC to maintain/defend a peg or price level is not going to work when depositors want to get their money back out.” Get $50 free to trade crypto when you sign up to Bybit now",News|Bitcoin,EN,0,0,BTC|FIAT|MARKET|REGULATION|TRADING|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-12-08 23:16:52

Economists are betting on a rate cut come Wednesday, which has helped to lift prices after a difficult few weeks for crypto. Bitcoin is up by 3% today, while altcoins such as Ethereum, Solana, and Cardano have posted gains closer to 4%, while Canton and Zcash are up by more than 13%. Now is therefore a good time to be reentering the market, and we’ve accordingly picked our next altcoin to turn $100 into $10,000, which is the exciting new ERC-20 token PEPENODE ($PEPENODE) . Next Altcoin to Turn $100 into $10,000 – 8 December First unveiled in September, PEPENODE has since gone on to raise more than $2.2 million in its ongoing presale, which is quickly attracting new converts. This figure provides a strong vote of confidence in the new project, which is aiming to make cryptocurrency mining more accessible to average investors. It will do this by enabling users to build and run their own virtual mining rigs, instead of requiring them to invest in expensive mining hardware, as proof-of-work cryptocurrencies do. By spending PEPENODE tokens on new virtual nodes and by upgrading and combining these nodes, users can earn greater mining rewards. PEPENODE pays out mining rewards in external tokens such as Fartcoin and Pepe, providing users with a very strong incentive to acquire more PEPENODE tokens in order to enhance their mining rigs. There may be multiple paths but they always lead back to one thing… Upgrading Those Nodes https://t.co/FaKIaBoHfa pic.twitter.com/L6mF94nPB9 — PEPENODE (@pepenode_io) December 8, 2025 Holders of the token will also be able to stake it for a passive income, with the current rate of return at 565% APY . This is hugely generous, and arguably makes PEPENODE one of the most attractive new tokens to invest in at the moment. PEPENODE Will Launch Soon: Here’s How to Buy Early Traders can invest in PEPENODE by going to its official website and joining its presale, which will run for several more weeks, at which point the coin will list on exchanges. PEPENODE will have a max supply of 210 billion tokens, with its allocation divided between development, marketing, node rewards, liquidity, and its treasury. It’s currently selling at a price of $0.0011825, although this price will continue to rise every three days until the same comes to an end. Investors can use ETH, USDT, BNB, or fiat to buy whatever amount of the token they want, and will receive their coins once the sale closes. Given the market appears to be preparing for a big comeback, now may be an ideal time for a new token launch. And because it has such strong fundamentals, PEPENODE is our next altcoin to turn $100 into $10,000.

He argues that multi-year low gas fees have bred complacency, with a massive shift in retail activity to cheaper Layer 2 networks like Base and Arbitrum sidelining the altcoin’s issue. Average Ethereum gas price. Source: Etherscan . His solution: an on-chain prediction market designed to help users secure future gas prices and mitigate sudden spikes in transaction costs on the network. We need a good trustless onchain gas futures market. (Like, a prediction market on the BASEFEE) I've heard people ask: ""today fees are low, but what about in 2 years? You say they'll stay low because of increasing gaslimit from BAL + ePBS + later ZK-EVM, but do I believe you?""… — vitalik.eth (@VitalikButerin) December 6, 2025 An on-chain futures curve would provide a clear signal of long-term market expectations. It would permit users to prepay for block space and lock in costs regardless of future spikes. With a shared reference point for future network conditions, developers could buy gas insurance to cap operating costs ahead of critical events, while heavy users could also offset future fee spikes by taking the opposite market position. This all amounts to a more favourable platform for users, facilitating the transition from web-2 to web-3 as blockchain technology needs the reliability expected at the institutional level. Ethereum Price Predictions: Adoption Could Fuel New All-Time Highs The potential adoption of controlled gas fees could bring to Ethereum could help fuel the breakout of a bullish 19-month head-and-shoulder pattern, now unfolding.

The RSI is closing in on the 50 neutral line, forming several higher lows as buyers step in. The MACD also displays a growing lead on the signal line, suggesting a sustained bullish trend. A fully realised pattern breakout could see the neckline reclaimed around $5,500 , reclaiming past all-time highs and entering new price discovery in a 90% move . But as the bull market matures, if Ethereum finds a bigger part to play in the transition from Web2 to Web3, the move could extend 250% to $10,000 .

Here’s The Latest,https://timestabloid.com/another-win-for-xrp-in-asia-heres-the-latest/,"Professional investors in Hong Kong now have direct access to XRP trading using the Hong Kong Dollar (HKD), following its addition to the lineup of assets available on OSL, one of the region’s licensed digital asset exchanges. The platform disclosed that XRP has been integrated into its Flash Trade service, broadening its market offerings for institutional-level users who operate under Hong Kong’s regulatory framework. OSL confirmed that both deposits and withdrawals for XRP are active on the XRP Ledger (XRPL). With this update, trading is available across three markets: XRP/HKD, XRP/USDT, and XRP/USD. Under local rules, only clients classified as Professional Investors can use this feature, and OSL emphasized that the restriction is consistent with the jurisdiction’s compliance standards. XRP is now available at OSL HK — secure, compliant access to one of the world’s most established digital assets. Renowned for its speed and efficiency in cross-border transactions, XRP expands OSL HK’s token lineup. Available to Professional Investors via Flash Trade &… pic.twitter.com/SWFUlCIta9 — OSL HK (@OSL_HK) December 5, 2025 Importance of the HKD Trading Pair The introduction of an XRP/HKD pair represents an important development for investors seeking direct exposure without relying on foreign stablecoins or multiple conversions. Although several licensed exchanges in Hong Kong support XRP, most only offer trading against stablecoins such as USDT. HashKey , for example, provides access to XRP but does not currently offer an HKD pair. OSL’s decision to enable HKD-based trading gives market participants a more convenient way to access the asset and reduces dependence on additional currency conversions. Hong Kong’s Supportive Regulatory Landscape Hong Kong continues to position itself as a welcoming environment for digital asset companies through clear and structured regulations. The government has taken steps to attract reputable industry players while maintaining oversight, resulting in a market that encourages innovation while adhering to compliance requirements. Within this environment, the availability of a direct HKD pair strengthens XRP’s presence and supports broader adoption among investors who prefer to operate within a recognized regulatory system. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 As part of the listing announcement, OSL outlined the characteristics that define XRP’s use case. The exchange noted that XRP is designed to facilitate low-cost cross-border transactions and microtransactions, supported by the XRPL’s rapid settlement time, which generally completes transfers within a few seconds. OSL also referenced the asset’s decentralized validator network and its ability to move value without centralized oversight. Market Context and Recent XRP Performance The listing arrives at a time when XRP has shown upward movement in the broader market. Over the past 24 hours, the asset recorded an increase of about 4.75%, reaching a price of $2.09 . This positive momentum, combined with expanded trading access in a regulated center like Hong Kong, may encourage renewed attention from institutional investors. By enabling XRP/HKD trading, OSL has created a more accessible pathway for professional investors and reinforced Hong Kong’s status as one of the few jurisdictions offering regulated fiat-paired XRP trading. This development simplifies entry into the asset, aligns with the region’s commitment to transparent digital asset activity, and enhances the range of trading options available to institutions operating within Hong Kong’s financial system.

The current plans offer valuable tax advantages, but they force investors to deal with narrow, state-selected mutual fund portfolios that underperform relative to IRAs and HSAs. According to the Bitcoin Policy Institute, those limitations prevent households from accessing inflation-resistant assets and stronger long-term growth opportunities. The Bitcoin Policy Institute’s research has evaluated how modernizing 529 plans to permit Bitcoin allocations could improve returns and better safeguard education savings, working on the premise of Bitcoin’s history of delivering strong long-term performance and offering diversification benefits due to its low correlation with equities. Bitcoin Policy Institute drums up BTC for 529 plans According to the findings, portfolio modeling shows that even small allocations of Bitcoin (1–2%) increase compound annual returns and Sharpe ratios, boosting portfolio efficiency without materially increasing risk. The policy recommends the issuance of federal guidance or amendment of the tax code to allow Bitcoin in 529 plans, aligning them with the investment flexibility of IRAs and HSAs, with claims that such a model would streamline nationwide adoption.‍ Another recommendation is to establish the first Bitcoin-inclusive 529 plan in Wyoming—the only state without a current plan and encourage states to update their 529 offerings by incorporating BTC and other alternative assets, expanding payment capabilities (such as ACH), and advocating for more flexible rules on portfolio adjustments. The bottom line is that modernizing 529 plans—through federal guidance, state innovation, or both—would expand investor choice, increase portfolio resilience, and align education savings strategies with today’s financial realities. Growing interest in digital assets at the state level The discussion happening around BTC and 529 plans is happening as momentum around crypto-linked retirement exposure continues to grow nationwide, with citizens of the US looking forward to using their retirement savings to invest in cryptocurrencies, private equity, property, gold and other kinds of non-traditional assets. The consensus right now is that a presidential executive order has cleared the way for fiduciaries to offer crypto investments as an option. However, it will take some time for widespread availability to be implemented. In the meantime, regulatory bodies are working on new guidance to facilitate the change. In Indiana, there is a newly introduced bill that would require public retirement programs to offer Bitcoin-related investment options and also limit how much power local governments have to restrict the use of digital assets. The proposal, known as House Bill 1042, was filed on Thursday, December 4, by State Representative Kyle Pierce, a Republican from Anderson, and was presented during a meeting of the House Financial Institutions Committee. Its main focus is on giving public workers access to cryptocurrency investments while setting clear legal boundaries around digital asset use, custody, payments, and mining. Aside from forcing administrators of several state-run retirement and savings plans to include cryptocurrency exchange-traded funds as standard investment choices, the proposal would also permit certain public pension funds to invest directly in crypto-linked ETFs and give the state treasurer authority to place funds from specific accounts into stablecoin-based ETFs. According to Pierce, the bill is designed to give Indiana residents more financial flexibility, balancing investment choice with regulatory guardrails while allowing the state to explore potential government use of blockchain technology through pilot programs. The bill also includes clear safeguards for self-custody, and if enacted, would make Indiana the first state in the country to require publicly managed retirement programs to provide Bitcoin exposure as a standard option. Other states have taken similar steps, but none as overt as Indiana. Last year, Oklahoma passed a law preserving residents’ right to hold crypto in self-custody wallets and blocking special taxes on Bitcoin transactions. Then this year, Kentucky did something similar by formally recognizing self-custody as a protected property right. Meanwhile, Wyoming approved laws that allow public pension funds to invest in digital assets, and Arizona introduced legislation that would allow Bitcoin ETFs in retirement accounts.

The operation started as a minor investigation into a simple fraudulent crypto platform. Gradually, it expanded into a complex probe of a vast, unscrupulous money-laundering network. How it Happened The thieves created and operated many forged cryptocurrency investment platforms. They used high-quality deepfake advertisements to make their projects seem legit. They repeatedly called their customers, promising massive returns on investment. They also showed their users fake proof of profits realized on their platforms, thereby attracting thousands to interact with and deposit funds into these fake crypto platforms. Once these naive crypto enthusiasts transferred their crypto assets to the fraudulent platforms, the criminals moved them across various crypto networks and exchanges, cashing out the funds and extending the chain of their actions. The criminal act targeted people from Spain, France, Belgium, Bulgaria, Germany, and Malta. Notably, it was not limited to Europe as some of the victims were from Cyprus and Israel, both West Asia countries. Hence, authorities from these affected countries were a part of the investigation. Authorities Takedown $815M Fraudsters The first phase of the operation was executed on 27 October 2025 and ended successfully. In response to requests from authorities in France and Germany, the police raided strategic locations in Cyprus, Germany, and Spain, arresting nine individuals suspected of engaging in the laundering of funds stolen through shady crypto project operations. Following their apprehension, the police seized $350 million (€300,000) in cash, $931,000 (€800,000) in bank accounts, and $483,000 (€415,000) in cryptocurrencies. They also confiscated digital devices and high-value wristwatches from the suspected criminals. As the authorities delved deeper in the case, they realized it had grown beyond a simple fraud scheme into a sophisticated criminal operation. Hence, they carried out the second phase of the investigation, targeting the affiliate marketing infrastructure used by these online scammers. Meanwhile, the authorities have not concluded their operations. They are still conducting thorough investigations into the remaining stolen funds and plan to crack down on other individuals involved in the fraudulent act.

The cryptocurrency market, often driven by sentiment and momentum, is now showing clear bearish signals that demand attention. Recent analysis reveals concerning patterns in both on-chain metrics and broader economic factors that could impact Bitcoin ‘s near-term trajectory. Let’s examine why the market sentiment has turned cautious and what these developments mean for your portfolio. Why Is Bitcoin Showing Bearish Signs Right Now? The current Bitcoin market presents a complex picture where traditional bullish catalysts appear to be losing steam. According to recent analysis, several key metrics have shifted toward a more bearish outlook. The monthly futures premium, a reliable gauge of market sentiment, has dropped below the neutral 5% threshold. This decline suggests that institutional traders are becoming less optimistic about Bitcoin ‘s immediate price prospects. Moreover, the options market tells an even clearer story—put options now carry a significant premium, indicating heightened demand for downside protection. What Do On-Chain Metrics Reveal About BTC’s Health? On-chain analysis provides crucial insights into Bitcoin ‘s fundamental strength, and current data points to concerning trends. The lack of substantial inflows into spot Bitcoin ETFs represents a significant shift from earlier this year when these products drove substantial buying pressure. Additionally, network activity and transaction volumes have shown patterns consistent with previous bearish phases. Key indicators to watch include: Futures premium below neutral levels – signaling reduced institutional optimism Elevated put option costs – indicating increased hedging against declines Reduced ETF inflows – showing diminished institutional participation Exchange outflow patterns – suggesting changing holder behavior How Are Macroeconomic Factors Impacting Bitcoin? The broader economic landscape plays a crucial role in cryptocurrency markets, and current conditions are creating headwinds for Bitcoin . The declining probability of Federal Reserve interest rate cuts removes a potential catalyst that many investors had anticipated. Higher interest rates typically reduce risk appetite across financial markets, including cryptocurrencies. Furthermore, the slump in the U.S. real estate market signals potential economic stress that could affect investor confidence. These macro factors combine to create a challenging environment for risk assets like Bitcoin . What Does the Options Market Tell Us About Sentiment? The derivatives market offers valuable insights into trader expectations, and current data reveals a distinctly bearish tilt. On Deribit, one of the largest crypto options exchanges, BTC put options are trading at a 13% premium compared to call options. This premium indicates that traders are willing to pay more for protection against price declines—a classic characteristic of bearish market conditions. The options skew, which measures the relative cost of puts versus calls, has shifted significantly toward puts, suggesting that professional traders are positioning for potential downside. Can Bitcoin Overcome These Bearish Headwinds? While the current indicators appear bearish , cryptocurrency markets have historically demonstrated remarkable resilience. However, overcoming these challenges requires monitoring several key developments. The return of sustained ETF inflows could provide necessary buying pressure, while any shift in Federal Reserve policy could improve risk sentiment. Additionally, Bitcoin ‘s upcoming halving event in 2024 remains a fundamental bullish factor that could eventually outweigh short-term bearish signals. Investors should watch for: Institutional adoption trends – particularly through regulated products Regulatory developments – that could improve market structure Network growth metrics – indicating fundamental adoption Macroeconomic policy shifts – that could improve risk appetite The current Bitcoin market presents a cautionary tale for investors. Multiple indicators from both on-chain data and macroeconomic analysis point to a bearish outlook that demands careful attention. While the cryptocurrency has weathered similar periods before, the convergence of negative signals across derivatives markets, ETF flows, and economic conditions suggests a period of heightened risk. Savvy investors should maintain a balanced perspective, recognizing both the challenges and the long-term potential of Bitcoin as a transformative asset class. Frequently Asked Questions What does ‘bearish’ mean for Bitcoin? ‘Bearish’ describes a market outlook where prices are expected to decline. For Bitcoin, this means indicators suggest the cryptocurrency may face downward pressure in the near term. How reliable are futures premiums as indicators? Futures premiums are generally reliable sentiment indicators because they reflect institutional expectations. When premiums drop below neutral levels, it suggests professional traders are less optimistic about immediate price appreciation. Why do put option premiums matter? Put options give holders the right to sell at a specific price. When these options trade at higher premiums than call options, it indicates increased demand for downside protection—a bearish signal. Can Bitcoin ETFs reverse bearish trends? Yes, sustained inflows into spot Bitcoin ETFs can provide significant buying pressure that could counteract bearish signals. However, current data shows diminished institutional participation through these vehicles. How long do bearish phases typically last in crypto? Bearish phases in cryptocurrency markets can vary significantly, from several weeks to multiple months. The duration depends on multiple factors including market structure, adoption trends, and macroeconomic conditions. Should I sell my Bitcoin during bearish periods? Investment decisions should align with your individual strategy and risk tolerance. Some investors use bearish periods to accumulate at lower prices, while others may reduce exposure.

But when sentiment hits extremes like this, it often signals the opposite of what traders expect and could favor a bullish XRP price prediction . Santiment data shows social sentiment has plunged into “Extreme Fear,” while CoinMarketCap’s Fear and Greed Index dropped to just 16. From Wednesday to Friday, XRP slipped from $2.20 to $2, capping off three days of selling pressure. Yet behind the scenes, investor interest appears to be building. XRP-linked ETFs have now recorded 15 consecutive days of net inflows, according to SoSo Value, totaling nearly $900 million in fresh capital. Combined assets under management for these funds now sit at $861 million, suggesting that both retail and institutional investors are positioning for a rebound. With fear rising and big money flowing in, this could be the early stage of a major reversal. XRP Price Prediction: XRP Is Forming a Bullish Falling Channel Pattern XRP has bounced off the $1.95 support zone and is now forming a series of higher lows, signaling a potential trend reversal. Source: TradingView The next key level to watch is $2.20. A breakout above this resistance, followed by a successful retest, could confirm a bullish reversal pattern and open the door to a rally toward $3+. In the past 24 hours, XRP has gained 3.3%, with trading volume jumping nearly 90%. With momentum building, the token could be positioning itself for a major breakout. As broader crypto sentiment begins to shift, some of the most promising new projects have continued to gain traction. One project in particular is Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) , a presale project building a Solana-powered layer-2 solution for Bitcoin. By combining Bitcoin’s security with Solana’s speed and scalability, $HYPER is creating a new level of utility for Bitcoin, and investors have taken notice, with millions raised so far. Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) Lets Investors Earn Passive Income on BTC Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) was created to address the Bitcoin blockchain’s long-standing scalability issues by introducing a Solana-powered infrastructure that reduces transaction fees and speeds up transaction speeds.

Revisiting Amazon’s Long-Term Growth Pattern The discussion gained momentum after market analyst 24hrscrypto1 referenced the growth of Amazon’s stock price during its early years. He pointed to data showing that Amazon traded at only $0.09 in the late 1990s before gradually rising to more than $229 over an extended period. According to the figures he shared, this represents a cumulative increase exceeding 250,000%. The analyst emphasized that Amazon did not immediately gain widespread recognition and spent many years in periods of slow movement before registering major gains. He argued that this timeline demonstrates how large returns often require sustained patience, especially in sectors that involve new technologies or emerging markets. Everyone crying that “XRP is taking forever” needs to look at this chart and breathe for a second… Amazon was $0.09 in 1997 and nobody cared… Nobody understood it Nobody had the patience People want Amazon level returns… …but with microwave level patience. pic.twitter.com/tcsAsssGZa — 𝟸𝟺𝙷𝚁𝚂𝙲𝚁𝚈𝙿𝚃𝙾 (@24hrscrypto1) December 8, 2025 Growing Concerns Inside the XRP Community The comparison surfaced amid increasing frustration among XRP holders. The asset has experienced slow momentum even as several major developments have unfolded. Ripple allocated $2.5 billion this year toward various initiatives, and XRP-focused exchange-traded funds reportedly accumulated close to $1 billion in their first month of activity. Despite these notable events, XRP’s price has fallen by more than 26% over the past two months. The extended consolidation has led many investors to express concern about XRP’s performance relative to other digital assets. According to 24hrscrypto1, the dissatisfaction reflects a broader trend in which many traders expect substantial gains within short periods but are reluctant to endure lengthy phases of limited price action. He argued that this mindset overlooks how long it can take for underlying technologies to develop and for market participants to fully appreciate their value.

Some commentators stated that the analogy does not hold up when reviewing long-term charts. One user, Mortimer, argued that Amazon’s price history shows steady progression over time, whereas XRP’s chart displays frequent stagnation across multiple years. He contended that the patterns are fundamentally different. In response, 24hrscrypto1 said that the appearance of Amazon’s growth curve is influenced by hindsight. He suggested that looking at Amazon’s early chart without knowledge of its future success would show slow progress similar to what XRP is currently experiencing. He maintained that XRP may still be in the early stages of realizing its potential. Another participant noted that, historically, XRP’s appreciation from its lowest recorded levels to its past highs still reflects strong lifetime gains. Even so, some analysts argue that the asset may have already passed its most significant growth phase. While some community members use Amazon’s history to support optimistic projections for XRP, others cautioned that equating a cryptocurrency with a longstanding corporation can lead to unrealistic assumptions. One critic pointed out that Amazon’s value is linked to a business producing revenue, while XRP functions as a digital asset without the same type of financial foundation. He warned that drawing parallels between the two may encourage misplaced confidence. Disclaimer : This content is meant to inform and should not be considered financial advice.

55523518,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=238787,1765238411,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Hold Bitcoin for Decades: Strategy CEO’s Bold 2065 Commitment Reveals Unwavering Conviction,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/strategy-ceo-hold-bitcoin-2065/,"BitcoinWorld Hold Bitcoin for Decades: Strategy CEO’s Bold 2065 Commitment Reveals Unwavering Conviction In a stunning declaration of long-term faith, Strategy CEO Phong Le has announced the company plans to hold Bitcoin in its treasury for over four decades, with a target date of 2065. This move signals a profound shift in how institutions view digital assets, not as a short-term trade, but as a generational store of value. But what does this mean for everyday investors and the broader crypto market? Why Would a Company Commit to Hold Bitcoin for 40+ Years? During a CNBC interview, Phong Le provided clear reasoning for this unprecedented timeline. He stated that Strategy’s stock remains a crucial vehicle for investors seeking exposure to Bitcoin, even after the introduction of spot Bitcoin ETFs. The decision to hold Bitcoin until at least 2065 is a strategic commitment to this thesis. It transforms Bitcoin from a speculative asset on the balance sheet into a core, long-term strategic holding. This approach communicates unwavering conviction to shareholders and the market. It suggests the company views Bitcoin’s potential maturation and adoption as a multi-decade journey. Therefore, they are insulating their strategy from short-term price volatility and regulatory noise. Strategy Stock vs. Spot Bitcoin ETFs: What’s the Better Play? Le’s comments highlight an interesting dynamic in the investment landscape. With spot ETFs now available, why choose a company stock to gain Bitcoin exposure? Le argues Strategy offers something unique. Active Management: The company can make strategic decisions about buying, holding, or leveraging its Bitcoin position. Additional Value: Investors get exposure to Strategy’s core business and management expertise, not just the crypto asset. Long-Term Alignment: The 2065 pledge aligns management’s incentives with shareholders who believe in Bitcoin’s long-term future. Essentially, buying Strategy stock is a bet on both Bitcoin’s success and the company’s ability to manage that exposure wisely over time. The commitment to hold Bitcoin acts as a powerful anchor for that strategy. What Are the Risks of Such a Long-Term Bitcoin Hold? While bold, this strategy is not without significant challenges. Committing to an asset class as young and evolving as cryptocurrency for 40 years involves inherent risks. Technological Disruption: Could a new technology surpass Bitcoin? Regulatory Uncertainty: Long-term global regulatory frameworks are still undefined. Market Volatility: Extreme price swings could test the resolve of any holder. Execution Risk: The company must maintain its operational strength for decades to uphold this promise. However, by publicly stating its intent, Strategy is betting that these risks are outweighed by the potential reward. The move may encourage other corporations to consider similar long-term crypto strategies. Key Takeaways for Investors from This Bold Move Strategy’s announcement is more than a corporate headline; it’s a case study in conviction. For investors, it underscores several critical points. First, institutional adoption of Bitcoin is moving beyond speculation into strategic allocation. Second, having a clear, long-term plan is crucial when dealing with volatile assets. The decision to hold Bitcoin indefinitely removes the emotion of timing the market. Finally, it highlights the importance of choosing investment vehicles that match your belief in the asset’s timeline. In conclusion, Strategy CEO Phong Le’s pledge to hold Bitcoin until 2065 is a landmark moment of institutional confidence. It frames Bitcoin not as a passing trend, but as a foundational asset for the digital age. This long-term vision could inspire a new wave of corporate treasury strategies and reshape how all investors think about the time horizon for crypto investments. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q: Why 2065? Is that a specific target? A> The year 2065 is likely a symbolic date representing a commitment far beyond typical investment cycles, emphasizing a multi-generational hold rather than a precise target. Q: Does this mean Strategy will never sell any Bitcoin? A> The statement suggests a core, long-term holding strategy. The company may still manage the position tactically, but the intent is to maintain a significant Bitcoin treasury for decades. Q: How does this affect the price of Bitcoin? A> While one company’s strategy doesn’t directly control price, such strong, public conviction from a CEO can boost market sentiment and encourage other institutions to consider similar long-term holds. Q: Should I copy this strategy for my personal portfolio? A> Not necessarily. A corporate treasury strategy differs from personal investing. Always assess your own risk tolerance, timeline, and financial goals. Consider consulting a financial advisor. Q: What happens if Phong Le is no longer CEO? A> This is a key risk. The commitment is tied to current leadership. Future management could change the strategy, though such a public pledge creates expectations for continuity.

The broader crypto landscape remains sharply divided: some analysts argue that ETH and the rest of the market still face downward continuation, potentially setting new local lows, while others believe this correction is simply a reset before a much larger bull cycle—possibly extending into 2026. Related Reading: Bitcoin Must Break $97K To Restore Confidence Among Youngest Long-Term Holders – Details Yet one signal stands out clearly amid the noise: smart whales are unanimously going long on ETH. On-chain data shows that several of the most profitable and consistent whale traders—each with tens of millions in realized gains—have opened substantial long positions, collectively exceeding hundreds of millions of dollars. Their coordinated behavior indicates confidence that Ethereum’s recent lows represent opportunity rather than danger. This alignment among top-performing whales introduces a compelling counterpoint to bearish narratives. While retail sentiment remains fragile, the most sophisticated market participants appear to be positioning for a larger move ahead. As Ethereum stabilizes above $3,150, the question now becomes whether whale conviction will prove to be early—or correct. Top Performers Load Up on Ethereum According to Hyperdash data shared by Lookonchain, some of the most successful and influential whales in the market are aggressively accumulating Ethereum—sending a strong signal that high-conviction players expect upside ahead. One of the most notable is BitcoinOG, the trader widely recognized for shorting the market during the violent 10/10 crash, a move that earned him significant credibility. With a total realized PNL of $105 million, BitcoinOG is now positioned firmly on the bullish side, holding 54,277 ETH worth approximately $169.48 million. Another major player is the well-known Anti-CZ whale, named for his historical pattern of taking the opposite side of positions favored by Binance founder Changpeng Zhao. With an impressive $58.8 million in total PNL, this whale is currently long 62,156 ETH—a massive $194 million position. His trades have often been early indicators of broad market direction, adding weight to this shift toward bullish exposure. Finally, pension-usdt.eth, a consistently profitable whale address with $16.3 million in realized gains, is long 20,000 ETH valued at $62.5 million. Taken together, these positions reflect a unified stance among top-performing whales: despite market uncertainty, they are positioning for Ethereum strength. Related Reading: Ethereum Shows Signs Of Accumulation As CVD Strengthens And Correlation Stays Elevated Weekly Structure Shows Early Signs of Stabilization Ethereum’s weekly chart reveals a market attempting to regain its footing after a sharp multi-week decline from the $4,500 region. The recent reclaim of $3,150 is a meaningful development, as this level aligns closely with prior weekly support from mid-2024 and sits just above the 50-week moving average—an area that often acts as a trend-defining zone. ETH briefly dipped below this region during the November selloff, but buyers stepped in aggressively, producing a strong weekly wick that signals demand at lower levels. Despite this recovery attempt, ETH remains below key resistance levels. The 20-week and 100-week moving averages are positioned above the current price and converging, creating a zone of potential rejection unless momentum strengthens. For now, ETH is trading in a transitional structure: no longer trending downward aggressively, but not yet showing a confirmed bullish reversal on high timeframes. Related Reading: Ethereum NUPL Holds Steady, Signaling Market Balance Amid Volatility Volume patterns also support this interpretation. Selling volume has diminished compared to the capitulation phase, while recent green candles show moderate but steady buying interest—suggesting accumulation rather than full risk-on behavior. If ETH can establish consecutive weekly closes above $3,200–$3,300, the chart opens the door for a retest of the $3,600–$3,800 range. Failure to hold $3,150, however, risks another move toward $2,800 support.

According to the report, XRP is garnering institutional interest and demand on a global scale. While retail traders debate short-term price movements , smart money capital inflows into XRP are surpassing those of almost every other altcoin. XRP Dominates Institutional Inflows Across Europe And The Globe According to an X post by crypto expert Stern Drew, the latest WisdomTree report shows that XRP is the only digital asset attracting consistent institutional demand worldwide. In Europe, XRP has attracted over $549 million in new institutional capital this year, more than three times the inflows into Ethereum. This figure surpasses the total for every altcoin in the market and multi-asset products except Bitcoin. In a continent traditionally known for conservative investment strategies, these flows into XRP represent a decisive vote of confidence from European institutional investors . Drew has revealed that the demand for XRP has also extended beyond Europe. Outside the United States, XRP has captured roughly $252 million in fresh institutional capital just this year. By comparison, Bitcoin products absorbed only $268 million in smart money capital. Given that BTC products are more than 25 times the size of XRP products, this suggests that institutions have directed nearly 25 times more new capital into XRP than into Bitcoin. Drew has suggested that this increase in flows indicates careful, deliberate positioning rather than short-term speculative activity, which highlights the market’s growing preference for XRP . US Adoption Signals Broader Shift In his post, Drew also revealed the growing institutional interest in XRP within the US. This year, a new synthetic XRP product attracted $241 million, surpassing flows into Solana and all other altcoin products in the same category. This surge came at a time when the two largest cryptocurrencies, Bitcoin and Ethereum, collectively saw $6.4 billion exit their ETF structures . Drew revealed that the dramatic outflows from BTC and ETH signaled that institutional investors were diversifying from established assets while selectively accumulating XRP. The WisdomTree report also showed that, excluding Europe and the US, regions such as Asia and other global markets are increasing their exposure to XRP. Surprisingly, this surge in global institutional demand is occurring during periods of market stress rather than euphoric rallies. The XRP price is currently down by more than 15% this year and trading at just $2.1. The cryptocurrency has also been experiencing significant choppy action over the past few months, failing to reclaim former highs above $3. Despite this structural weakness, institutions continue to accumulate XRP in large quantities, indicating a clear bias toward the cryptocurrency. Drew has also revealed that smart money views XRP as a settlement-grade asset , well-suited for integration into the future architecture of regulated digital finance. He highlights that, as global institutional preference increasingly concentrates on XRP, price movements might follow later.",XRP|bitcoin|Ethereum|ripple|solana|Stern Drew|wisdomtree|XRP news|XRP price|XRPUSD|XRPUSDT,EN,0,0,BTC|ETH|MARKET|XRP|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-12-09 00:00:59

The regulator published its proposals on December 8, targeting improvements to how firms interact with experienced clients while simplifying the investment journey for ordinary consumers. The measures form part of efforts to bolster the UK's position as a leading financial hub and encourage greater participation in capital markets. The FCA's framework establishes distinct regulatory pathways for different investor categories. Professional investors will operate outside certain retail regulations, though the threshold for qualification remains deliberately stringent. Only individuals with substantial market experience, access to professional advice, or a genuine capacity to absorb investment losses will qualify for professional status. New Classification System Removes Arbitrary Barriers The current system relies on what regulators describe as arbitrary tests that fail to assess investor sophistication accurately. The revised approach places responsibility directly on firms to verify that clients genuinely meet professional standards before classification. Wealthy and experienced individuals gain access to a streamlined process for opting out of retail protections. Firms must obtain documented informed consent from clients choosing this route. The requirement ensures investors understand the protections they are waiving. Simon Walls, Executive Director of Markets at the FCA, stated that the changes aim to support an investment culture across all investor types. The framework provides retail customers with clearer information while giving professional markets defined boundaries based on contractual agreements and proportionate oversight. Professional investors will no longer face constraints such as the Consumer Duty, a regulation requiring firms to deliver good outcomes for retail clients. The exemption allows more flexible engagement between firms and sophisticated investors who can negotiate terms directly. Simplified Disclosure Requirements for Retail Investors The regulator is overhauling its communications with retail investors. Prescriptive templates inherited from European Union regulations will be replaced with a more flexible approach centered on Consumer Duty principles. Firms will gain freedom to design disclosures that effectively communicate investment risks, costs, and potential returns. The Consumer Composite Investments regime replaces the existing PRIIPs and UCITS frameworks, which consumers have historically found difficult to understand. The FCA has opened a consultation examining how regulation can better facilitate consumer access to investments. The review specifically considers expanding retail investor access to private markets, an asset class that has traditionally been reserved for institutional players. Britain faces challenges in encouraging investment participation. Recent research indicates 55 percent of adults remain unwilling to accept investment risks. This reluctance has significant economic implications. Analysis shows half of British household wealth outside pensions sits in property, while 15 percent of the population holds their savings in cash.

The conflict intensified when OKX announced on December 5 that it would terminate its service and migrate to a new platform by the end of December. MANTRA CEO JP Mullin claimed that the data is inaccurate and turns the process back to front, posing a risk that users will act on timelines that do not match Governance Proposal 26. Governance mismatch and conflicting dates The central issue is OKX’s assertion that the OM migration will occur between December 22 and December 25, 2025. According to MANTRA, the official governance proposal states that migration can only begin after the ERC-20 OM token has been fully deprecated. The deprecation deadline is January 15, 2026. On December 5, 2025, OKX published a statement entitled “OKX to support OM crypto migration”. This statement contained multiple factual errors and misrepresentations not present in official MANTRA governance proposals. We are incredibly concerned by this development, which shows… — JP Mullin (🕉, 🏘️) (@jp_mullin888) December 8, 2025 Proposal 26 also states that the migration date is conditional on the completion of additional technical review and does not assign any December dates to the conversion process. The project also pointed out that OKX had announced several dates in December that were not discussed with MANTRA , including trading services, deposits, withdrawals, and a December 22 snapshot. MANTRA claimed that no dates have been finalized regarding migration and emphasized that since April 13, the exchange has not communicated with the project regarding the specifics of migration. Exchange-imposed suspension schedule The December 5 announcement by OKX details significant changes to how OM trading will work. With OM, borrowing was to close on December 5, and between December 12 and December 19, the OM/USDT margin trading was to be suspended. OM-linked perpetual futures were to be delisted on December 15. Trading bots linked to the affected markets would gradually decrease in activity before each suspension. OM pairs were to be paused in the spot market between December 19 and 22, and OKX said that all deposits, withdrawals and transfers would end at 03:00 UTC on December 22. The user balance record was recorded at the same time, with OKX stating that the migration would continue until December 25. The exchange explained that no accounts with a balance below 10 OM would be converted and that only users with a KYC Level 2 or higher would be able to convert. During the migration period, OKX reported that information regarding OM valuation would be unavailable. MANTRA CEO advises users to retain direct custody Reacting to this, the MANTRA CEO encouraged users to take their OM out of OKX and migrate it through the official project channels as soon as the process becomes accessible. According to MANTRA, this method will ensure that their governance decisions are based on their own timeline, rather than an exchange-issued timeline, which aligns with Proposal 26. The team added that every other big exchange has been aligning their preparations with MANTRA, and that the only exchange to announce dates without liaising with the project was OKX. MANTRA further indicated that it is determined to work with all OM retail holders during the transition and will continue to collaborate with the exchanges to ensure that the migration process is accurate and consistent.

The regulator found X to be in violation of the EU’s digital regulations after a two-year investigation. US officials, including Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Vice President JD Vance, were also critical of the EU, claiming that the decision is an attack on American companies. Why did the EU fine Elon Musk’s company? Elon Musk’s social media platform, X, has been fined £120 million ($140 million) for breaching the European Union’s digital regulations. The Digital Services Act was adopted in 2022 to regulate online platforms, but this is the first time the EU has issued a non-compliance decision under its rules. The fine covers three main violations confirmed during the two-year investigation, including the deceptive design of X’s blue checkmark system, the lack of transparency in its advertising repository, and failure to provide access to public data for researchers. Before Musk acquired X in 2022, the platform was known as Twitter, and blue checkmarks were largely reserved for celebrities, politicians and influential accounts. After the purchase, the site started issuing badges to anyone willing to pay $8 per month. European regulators argue this system makes it difficult for users to judge the authenticity of accounts and exposes them to scams and impersonation fraud. The fine breaks down into £45 million for the blue checkmark issue, £35 million for the advertising repository problems, and £40 million for blocking researchers from accessing public data. X now has 60 days to inform the Commission how it will fix the blue checkmark issues and 90 days to submit plans for fixing its advertising repository and researcher access problems. Failure to comply could lead to additional periodic penalty payments. How are U.S. officials reacting to the fine? The U.S. Secretary of State, Marco Rubio, called the fine an attack on American tech platforms and the American people by foreign governments. Vice President JD Vance accused the Commission of seeking to fine X for not engaging in censorship. Musk initially simply reacted with a post on X saying that the decision was “bullshit.” By Saturday, he had a much bigger reaction, stating that the EU should be abolished and sovereignty should be returned to individual countries so that their governments can better represent the people. U.S. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick recently stated that the EU must revise its digital regulations to secure a deal for reducing its steel and aluminum tariffs. The Trump administration has consistently argued that the EU unfairly targets U.S. technology companies with severe financial penalties and burdensome regulations. The U.S. Ambassador to the EU, Andrew Puzder, said the fine, which was placed not just on X but on Musk himself, is an example of regulatory overreach targeting American innovation. European officials have denied the accusations so far. A Commission spokesman, Thomas Regnier, stated at a press conference that the EU is not targeting anyone based on their country of origin. Regnier also noted that Europe’s preference had not been to fine X. He explained that when companies engage constructively with the Commission, they prefer to settle cases, using TikTok as an example. Meta was recently found in breach of EU competition rules over its pay or consent system earlier this year and was fined £200 million.

Acting Chairman Caroline Pham said the initiative was intended to draw digital-asset activity into U.S.-regulated markets and to get away from using offshore trading platforms. Bitcoin , Ethereum, and USDC will be treated solely as collateral for the first three months. The program establishes guardrails for Futures Commission Merchants (FCMs) accepting digital assets, requiring them to report weekly and receive timely alerts of operational issues. The CFTC also guided the application of tokenized real-world assets, including Treasury securities and money-market funds, under its current regime, with a focus on custody, segregation, valuation, and operational risks, while maintaining technology-neutral regulations. In carrying out the pilot, CFTC suspended Staff Advisory 20-34, a 2020 memo that has excluded FCMs from accepting digital assets as collateral. The agency said advances in tokenization and the GENIUS Act had rendered the advisory obsolete. The GENIUS Act, passed in July, established a federal framework for non-securities digital assets and expanded the CFTC’s authority over both spot crypto markets and tokenized collateral. Coinbase’s chief legal officer, Paul Grewal, backed such a change, identifying the 2020 advisory as a “concrete ceiling on innovation” that went beyond regulatory limits and irritated the President’s Working Group on Digital Asset Markets. U.S. derivatives markets set to welcome institutional crypto activity The CFTC’s pilot program could have a ripple effect on the U.S. cryptocurrency market. Allowing tokenized assets, such as Bitcoin, Ethereum, and USDC, to serve as margin collateral may help increase the liquidity of derivatives markets and attract new institutional investors who currently avoid U.S.-regulated platforms due to stringent regulations. Improved inclusion by these investors may lead to reduced dependence on offshore exchanges, thereby increasing the number of trades and the capital raised under U.S. regulatory oversight. Analysts suggest that adding tokenized collateral could also stabilize the market through standardized reporting and operational safeguards – something that could help mitigate the kind of volatility seen in the digital asset space. The pilot also indicates regulators are starting to come to terms with digital financial innovation, setting the stage for more crypto firms to do business in the U.S. rather than overseas. Broadly speaking, the program represents a significant step toward bridging the gap between traditional finance and digital asset markets. Spot crypto trading debuts on CFTC-registered exchanges The pilot is a few days after the CFTC approved spot crypto trading on CFTC-registered exchanges for the first time, a step Pham called unprecedented. Bitnomial exchange in Chicago, which is regulated as a derivatives venue, is now scheduled to launch leveraged spot trading, with its existing futures and options products, this week. The U.S. derivatives watchdog regulates the exchange as a designated contract market (DCM). This means that the new activity will be launching in a fully regulated space, following strong encouragement from the federal agency, including direct meetings with Acting Chairman Caroline Pham to help expedite the process during the prolonged federal government shutdown. “Recent events on offshore exchanges have shown us how essential it is for Americans to have more choice and access to safe, regulated U.S. markets,” Pham said in a statement. “Now, for the first time ever, spot crypto can trade on CFTC-registered exchanges that have been the gold standard for nearly a hundred years, with the customer protections and market integrity that Americans deserve.” The step, which Pham referred to as a “historic milestone,” tracks recommendations from the President’s Working Group on Digital Asset Markets, which issued a report this year outlining a crypto agenda for U.S. regulators. Pham noted the CFTC is “finally using our decades-long existing authority” to initiate this trading. Don’t just read crypto news. Understand it. Subscribe to our newsletter.

The Crypto Fear & Greed Index has frozen at a reading of 22, firmly planting the market in ‘extreme fear’ territory. This crucial sentiment gauge, a favorite among traders and analysts, suggests investor anxiety is running high. But what does this persistent fear actually signal, and more importantly, how should you navigate it? Let’s break down the numbers and the psychology behind them. What is the Crypto Fear & Greed Index Telling Us Right Now? The Crypto Fear & Greed Index is more than just a number. Compiled by Alternative.me, it acts as the market’s emotional pulse check. A score of 22, unchanged from the previous day, is a clear signal. The scale runs from 0 (extreme fear) to 100 (extreme greed). Therefore, hovering just above 20 indicates a market gripped by significant pessimism and caution. This isn’t a fleeting moment of doubt; it’s a sustained state of worry that influences trading decisions across the board. How is the Fear & Greed Index Calculated? This index doesn’t rely on gut feeling. It uses a data-driven formula to quantify the market’s mood. Understanding its components helps explain why the reading is so low: Volatility (25%): Sharp price swings, especially downward, increase fear. Market Volume (25%): High sell-off volume versus buying volume points to panic. Social Media (15%): The tone of conversations on platforms like Twitter and Reddit. Surveys (15%): Direct sentiment polls from the community. Bitcoin Dominance (10%): A shift to Bitcoin can signal a ‘flight to safety’. Google Trends (10%): Search volume for negative or positive terms. The current Crypto Fear & Greed Index score suggests these factors are collectively painting a bleak picture. Is Extreme Fear a Bad Sign or a Hidden Opportunity? This is the critical question for every investor. Historically, the Crypto Fear & Greed Index has been a powerful contrarian indicator. Periods of ‘extreme fear’ have often preceded major market bottoms and buying opportunities. Why? Because when everyone is selling in panic, assets can become undervalued. However, ‘extreme fear’ can also precede further declines if the underlying market issues are severe. The key is to differentiate between irrational panic and justified caution based on fundamental problems. Actionable Insights for Trading in a Fearful Market Navigating a market with a low Crypto Fear & Greed Index requires a cool head and a clear strategy. Here are some steps to consider: Do Not Panic Sell: Selling at the peak of fear often locks in losses. Review Your Portfolio: Assess which assets have strong fundamentals versus those driven purely by hype. Consider Dollar-Cost Averaging (DCA): This strategy involves buying fixed amounts at regular intervals, which can be effective in volatile, fearful markets. Set Clear Limits: Define your risk tolerance and set stop-loss orders if necessary to manage downside. Use the Index as a Gauge, Not a Gospel: It’s one tool among many. Combine it with technical and fundamental analysis. The Psychological Battle: Mastering Your Own Fear & Greed The most important chart isn’t on your screen; it’s in your mind. A low Crypto Fear & Greed Index often triggers our own worst instincts—the urge to follow the herd off a cliff. Successful investors learn to recognize these emotional triggers. They understand that market sentiment is cyclical. The extreme fear of today will eventually give way to optimism, and later, potentially to extreme greed. Your goal is not to time these cycles perfectly but to avoid making catastrophic decisions at the emotional extremes. In conclusion, the Crypto Fear & Greed Index holding at 22 is a stark reminder of the market’s current nervous disposition. It reflects real data from volatility, volume, and social sentiment. While it signals caution, history teaches us that such pervasive fear can also seed the next opportunity. The wisest approach is to stay informed, stick to your long-term strategy, and remember that in the chaotic world of crypto, sometimes the best move is to simply not make a move driven by panic. Use this period of fear to conduct thorough research and prepare for the market’s next phase. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q: What does a Crypto Fear & Greed Index score of 22 mean?

Have you noticed subtle shifts in the cryptocurrency market lately? The latest data reveals a fascinating development: the Altcoin Season Index has edged up to 19. This single-point movement might seem small, but for seasoned traders, it represents a potential early signal of changing market dynamics. Let’s explore what this means for your portfolio and whether we’re witnessing the beginning of a broader trend. What Exactly Is the Altcoin Season Index? CoinMarketCap’s Altcoin Season Index serves as a crucial market health indicator. The calculation is straightforward yet powerful: it compares the price performance of the top 100 cryptocurrencies (excluding stablecoins and wrapped coins) against Bitcoin over a 90-day period. When 75% of these altcoins outperform Bitcoin during this window, the market officially enters an “altcoin season.” Think of it as a market thermometer. A score closer to 100 indicates strong altcoin dominance, while lower scores suggest Bitcoin is leading the charge. The current reading of 19 represents a one-point increase from the previous day, moving the needle slightly toward potential altcoin strength. Why Should You Care About This Movement? Even a modest shift in the Altcoin Season Index matters because it reflects changing investor sentiment and capital flows. Here’s what this movement potentially signals: Early Rotation Signs: Money might be starting to flow from Bitcoin into alternative cryptocurrencies Risk Appetite Change: Investors could be becoming more comfortable with altcoin volatility Market Diversification: The crypto ecosystem may be broadening beyond Bitcoin dominance However, remember that we’re still far from the 75 threshold that defines a true altcoin season. This movement represents early-stage interest rather than confirmed trend reversal. How Does This Compare to Previous Market Cycles? Historical context helps us understand the significance of the current Altcoin Season Index reading. During major altcoin seasons, the index has consistently remained above 75 for extended periods. The current level of 19 indicates we’re in what many analysts call a “Bitcoin season” or transition phase. Previous cycles show that sustained movement above 50 often precedes stronger altcoin performance. Therefore, while the current reading remains low, the upward direction bears watching. The key question becomes: will this momentum continue, or is it just temporary market noise? What Actionable Insights Can You Take Away? Monitoring the Altcoin Season Index provides valuable information for your investment strategy. Here are practical ways to use this data: Watch for Consistency: Look for sustained upward movement rather than one-day spikes Combine with Other Indicators: Use the index alongside trading volume and market sentiment data Set Alert Levels: Consider establishing watch points at key levels like 25, 50, and 75 Review Your Portfolio: Assess whether your current allocation matches market conditions Remember that no single indicator should dictate your entire strategy. The Altcoin Season Index works best when combined with fundamental analysis and risk management principles. What’s the Current Market Reality? Despite the slight increase in the Altcoin Season Index , Bitcoin continues to dominate market conversations and capital. The cryptocurrency landscape remains heavily influenced by Bitcoin’s price movements and institutional adoption news. Many altcoins still move in correlation with Bitcoin, though decoupling events become more frequent as the index rises. The journey from 19 to 75 represents significant market evolution. It requires sustained altcoin outperformance across multiple sectors and projects. While some individual altcoins may shine, true season declaration demands broad-based strength. Conclusion: Reading Between the Numbers The Altcoin Season Index movement to 19 offers a glimpse into potential market evolution. While far from signaling a full altcoin season, this upward tick suggests increasing attention toward alternative cryptocurrencies. Savvy investors will monitor this trend while maintaining balanced perspectives on both Bitcoin and altcoin opportunities. The cryptocurrency market thrives on rotation and innovation. Today’s slight index movement could be tomorrow’s significant trend. Stay informed, stay diversified, and remember that understanding indicators like the Altcoin Season Index helps you navigate market transitions with greater confidence. Frequently Asked Questions What does an Altcoin Season Index of 19 mean? An index reading of 19 means that only a small percentage of top altcoins have outperformed Bitcoin over the past 90 days. We remain firmly in Bitcoin-dominant territory, though the upward movement suggests potential early interest in altcoins. How often does the Altcoin Season Index update? The index updates daily, providing regular snapshots of market rotation between Bitcoin and altcoins. This frequency helps traders spot emerging trends more quickly. Can the Altcoin Season Index predict price movements? While not a direct price predictor, the index reflects market sentiment and capital flows. Sustained movements often correlate with broader market trends, making it a valuable sentiment indicator. What happens when the index reaches 75? When the index sustains a reading of 75 or higher, it signals an official “altcoin season.” This means at least 75% of top altcoins have outperformed Bitcoin over the previous 90-day period. Should I buy altcoins when the index rises? Index movements should inform but not dictate investment decisions. Consider the index as one data point among many, and always conduct thorough research before making investment choices. How reliable is the Altcoin Season Index? The index has proven historically reliable for identifying market phases. However, like all indicators, it works best when combined with other analysis methods and should not be used in isolation.

As the development progress gets significant revisions and as the distribution of funds tightens, it can be considered that Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is getting into the spotlight of the conversation regarding being one of the most popular top cryptos below $0.05. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is developing a decentralized lending platform that will have a Peer to Contract and a Peer to Peers environment. Users in the P2C model are lending out assets like ETH or USDT and obtain mtTokens. Such mtTokens increase in value with the payment of interest by borrowers. With borrowing in the P2P environment, the interest rates vary with liquidity, the loan to value policies regulate the safe borrowing habits. Liquidation can be done in case the collateral is overly low. Liquidators cover some amount of debt and seize discounted collateral. Such an orderly structure is a strong contrast to the 2021 rise of SHIB, based on the sentiment, social trends and speculation. Mutuum Finance is also being characterized as a utility new crypto, and some investors think that this puts it in a better position to outperform meme assets over the long-term. Presale Growth, Metrics and Early Price Action Mutuum Finance started off in early 2025 at the price of $0.01. The token is currently trading at $0.035, which is 250% up in development. The project has also attracted more than 18,400 holders with a value of $19.2M. Over 810M MUTM tokens were already sold. The total token supply is 4B. Of these 1.82B tokens, which is equivalent to 45.5% are being allocated towards presale phases. Phase 6 has now penetrated beyond 95%, and there is only a small number of tokens at the present price. The official listing price is $0.06 which has also contributed towards accelerating participation since the distance between the two prices becomes difficult to overlook. Mutuum Finance also has a 24 hour leaderboard where the best user wins $500 worth of MUTM every day. This has contributed to continuous day-to-day interaction and presence in various parts of the world. Onboarding has also been made easy thanks to card payment access, not to mention that it has made it easy to participate in DeFi even among new participants. V1 Schedule, Security Stack and Analyst Expectations On its official X account, Mutuum Finance has confirmed that the V1 testnet will be deployed in Q4 2025. V1 will bring the lending pool, the mtTokens, the liquidation instruments and the debt-tracking module. Launched with support of ETH and USDT. This is the next milestone that is likely to attract new users with the protocol nearing operation into live mode. The role of security work has also contributed significantly to the establishment of trust on the project. Mutuum Finance has also been CertiK audited (Score: 90/100) on the Token Scan. Halborn Security is making checks on the lending contracts to ascertain that they are behaving per the actual circumstances. There is also a $50,000 bug bounty that runs the project, in order to fix the issues before the release of V1. The initial growth models emphasize that protocol-related yield, repurchase and scalability lending mechanisms can result in the token outperforming regular meme-based assets. A number of analyst forecasts currently place MUTM in a 5x to 7x band following V1 activation should there be an increase in borrowing demand. Layer-2 Scaling Mutuum Finance will establish a USD-pegged interest-backed stablecoin, according to the official roadmap. Stablecoins commonly become integrated in the lending ecosystem since it can ensure predictable borrowing and amplify liquidity. This acquisition should contribute towards the growth of the platform. The project will also be deployed in a variety of layer-2 networks. L2 support is accompanied by reduced fees and increased coverage and this is quite critical in the lending markets where collateral updates, interest and liquidation updates are frequent. L2 activities can also spur growth and reinforce greater liquidity. Chainlink feeds will be used as the primary oracle layer in the protocol. Other inputs on pricing will avoid the errors of liquidation. Precise pricing belongs to the most significant aspects of the lending platforms, which is why this arrangement is critical towards long-term viability. With such features put together, certain long term models have depicted a possibility of 800% upside potential over the next crypto cycles. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has surged 250%, raised 19.2M, higher than 18,400 holders and about to complete Phase 6 with an allotment of above 95%. Since V1 is planned to be activated in Q4, audited contracts, mtToken yield, buy pressure, stablecoin development, oracle protection and layer-2 planning, the project is accelerating much more rapidly than many pre-staged tokens.

55525093,642048,1765242043,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/55525093.jpeg,Crypto Community Reacts as U.S. Strategy Push AI While Leaving Digital Assets Undefined,https://bitcoinist.com/crypto-community-reacts-as-u-s-strategy-push-ai/,"The United States’ new national security strategy has renewed debate across the crypto community after omitting any direct reference to digital assets or blockchain technology. Released by the Trump administration, the document outlines the nation’s long-term security priorities and technological ambitions, yet its silence on crypto stands in contrast with both market momentum and recent political statements. As global financial systems increasingly integrate digital assets, many observers see the absence as a signal of policy uncertainty at a time when regulatory clarity is becoming more important for industry growth. Why Has AI Taken the Spotlight Across its 33 pages , the strategy places artificial intelligence, biotechnology, and quantum computing at the center of America’s next-generation competition. The administration states that U.S. technology and standards must “drive the world forward,” underscoring a focus on advanced computing rather than decentralized finance. Digital assets, which had gained prominence through previous remarks from officials, receive no explicit mention. This stands at odds with comments from President Trump in recent months. In a CBS 60 Minutes interview, he warned that China should not become the global leader in virtual assets and insisted that Bitcoin mining should remain within U.S. borders. A Subtle Reference, but No Clear Policy While crypto is not named in the strategy, the document does reference strengthening American “leadership in digital finance and innovation.” Analysts view this as a broad gesture rather than a firm policy direction, but it leaves open the possibility that digital assets may still influence future regulatory or economic strategies. This ambiguity comes despite a year of significant pro-crypto actions. Measures such as the GENIUS Act for stablecoin oversight , the formation of a crypto enforcement task force, reduced regulatory pressures on exchanges, and opposition to a central bank digital currency have all shaped expectations. The establishment of a national Bitcoin reserve, funded through forfeited digital assets, further signals that crypto remains a strategic consideration even if not formally acknowledged in the latest blueprint. Market Response and Broader Implications Currently trading around $91,900, Bitcoin briefly fell below $90,000 following the release of the strategy, a move compounded by broader macroeconomic pressures and anticipation of a Federal Reserve rate decision. The administration’s call for increased defense spending among NATO allies has also raised questions about inflation and monetary policy, factors that could influence investor appetite for digital assets. For now, the omission leaves the industry navigating a familiar gap of strong political rhetoric, scattered policy initiatives, but no comprehensive framework. As the U.S. centers its priorities around AI and quantum computing, crypto’s position in national strategy remains undefined. Is this the end of the ‘Crypto Administration’?

The mix of heavy buying by public firms and signs of miner strain is drawing attention from both bulls and bears. Related Reading: Bitcoin Adoption Is Just Getting Started — 200x Growth Possible, Tom Lee Says Saylor’s Tracker Signals According to a StrategyTracker chart shared by Michael Saylor, Strategy holds about 650,000 BTC with a portfolio value near $58 billion. The chart lists an average purchase price of $74,436 and shows 88 confirmed buy events over time. Saylor captioned the image “Back to Orange Dots?” — a short, familiar cue that has often come before a new accumulation round. Strategy’s most recent reported move was a 130 BTC buy, which fits the company’s long habit of adding during periods of market fear. That pattern matters because when an entity repeatedly buys through downswings, it shapes how other investors react. ₿ack to Orange Dots? pic.twitter.com/npB0NWSZ52 — Michael Saylor (@saylor) December 7, 2025 Corporate Buying Continues Based on reports from BitcoinTreasuries.NET, the top 100 public firms now hold about 1,059,453 BTC combined. ABTC reportedly added 363 BTC, the largest increase this week, while Cango Inc. purchased 130.6 BTC. Other names cited in recent filings include Bitdeer, BitFuFu, Hyperscale Data, Genius Group, and Bitcoin Hodl Co. These moves show that some companies keep expanding reserves even when prices wobble. For market watchers, steady corporate accumulation can be a calming force, though it does not erase broader sell pressure. On-Chain Stress Indicators According to Glassnode charts shared by the Bitcoin Archive, the Hash Ribbon has shifted bearish again, a sign that some miners are facing stress or even pausing operations. Short-Term Holder NUPL has fallen below zero, meaning many recent buyers are holding coins at a loss. Historically, episodes where miners are squeezed at the same time new holders are underwater have appeared near significant lows. That outcome is not certain, but the combination of technical miner strain and unrealized losses among short-term wallets is the kind of setup traders watch closely.

Some expect that corporate purchases and purchases by Strategy could blunt downside and spark a rebound. Others remain cautious because on-chain indicators point to real strain. Market action around major events, like central bank announcements, has also shown Bitcoin can stall before policy moves and then move sharply after.

With negotiations stalled and key disagreements unresolved, the future of a clear legal framework for cryptocurrencies in the United States hangs in the balance. This deadlock creates immense uncertainty for businesses and investors alike. Why Has Crypto Regulation Stalled in Congress? According to Senator Moreno, speaking at a Blockchain Association policy summit, the path to a bipartisan crypto regulation bill is currently blocked by fundamental disagreements. While the U.S. managed to pass the narrower GENIUS Act for stablecoins last summer, efforts for a broader, more comprehensive law have ground to a halt. The senator emphasized a firm stance, stating he would rather have no agreement than a bad one, refusing to include problematic provisions just for the sake of passing a bill. The core issues causing this impasse are not simple. They strike at the heart of how the U.S. government views and manages digital assets. The lack of progress leaves a regulatory gray area that many argue stifles innovation and fails to protect consumers. The Major Roadblocks to Agreement So, what are the specific hurdles preventing a deal on crypto regulation ? The negotiations have stumbled over two primary, and deeply complex, challenges: The SEC vs. CFTC Turf War: A major sticking point is defining the jurisdictional boundaries between the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC). Lawmakers must decide which agency gets primary oversight over different types of digital assets—a decision with huge implications for the industry. Consumer Protection Provisions: Crafting rules that adequately protect investors from fraud and market manipulation without being so restrictive that they crush legitimate innovation is a delicate balancing act. Agreeing on the specifics of these provisions has proven difficult. These are not minor technical details. They are foundational questions that will shape the U.S. crypto landscape for decades. Resolving them requires compromise from both political parties and regulatory bodies with sometimes competing philosophies. What’s Next for US Crypto Policy? Despite the current stalemate, the conversation is not over. Republicans and Democrats are scheduled to meet again to continue discussions. The question remains: can they bridge the gap? The outcome of these talks will determine whether the U.S. embraces a leadership role in the digital economy or continues with a patchwork of state rules and aggressive enforcement actions. The delay in federal crypto regulation has real-world consequences. It creates uncertainty for companies deciding where to base their operations and leaves everyday investors without clear protections. Many industry advocates warn that the United States risks falling behind other nations that are moving more swiftly to establish clear rules. The Final Verdict on the Regulatory Impasse The admission by Senator Moreno that crypto regulation talks have stalled is a pivotal moment. It highlights the profound challenges of governing a fast-evolving technological frontier with traditional political and regulatory tools. While the desire for a “no bad deal” is principled, the ongoing vacuum carries its own risks. The coming weeks will be critical as lawmakers reconvene, facing pressure from both an eager industry and a concerned public to find a viable path forward. The dream of comprehensive, clear crypto regulation remains alive, but its path through Congress is now fraught with significant obstacles. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What did Senator Bernie Moreno say about crypto regulation? A1: Senator Moreno stated that negotiations for a comprehensive crypto regulation bill in Congress have stalled due to key disagreements, primarily over SEC/CFTC jurisdiction and consumer protection rules. He expressed a preference for no deal over a bad one. Q2: What is the GENIUS Act? A2: The GENIUS Act is a U.S. law passed in the summer of 2023 that specifically regulates stablecoins—a type of cryptocurrency pegged to a stable asset like the U.S. dollar. The current stalled talks concern a much broader regulatory framework. Q3: Why is defining SEC vs. CFTC jurisdiction so important? A3: It’s crucial because the SEC regulates securities (investments), while the CFTC regulates commodities (like goods and futures). How a cryptocurrency is classified determines which rules apply, impacting everything from trading to disclosure requirements for companies. Q4: What happens if Congress can’t agree on crypto regulation? A4: Without federal legislation, the current state of regulatory uncertainty continues. This likely means more enforcement actions by the SEC and CFTC based on existing laws, a patchwork of state-level regulations, and continued legal ambiguity for businesses and investors. Q5: Are there any upcoming meetings about this? A5: Yes. According to reports, Republicans and Democrats in Congress are scheduled to meet on December 9th to continue discussions on the stalled crypto regulation bill. Q6: How does this stalemate affect the average crypto user? A6: It prolongs uncertainty. Users may face unclear tax reporting guidelines, inconsistent protections across different platforms, and a U.S. crypto industry that is hesitant to innovate or offer new services due to the lack of regulatory clarity.

This action sends a stark warning to the project and its investors, emphasizing that compliance and transparency are non-negotiable in today’s crypto landscape. The MASA delisting watchlist placement is not a final verdict but a critical probation period that could determine the token’s future on a major trading platform. Why Did Coinone Place MASA on the Delisting Watchlist? Coinone’s decision stems from a series of unresolved issues that raised red flags for the exchange’s compliance team. The primary reasons for the MASA delisting watchlist action are clear and focused on investor protection. The exchange stated it will monitor the project for approximately one month to verify if these significant concerns are adequately addressed. The core issues cited by Coinone include: Incomplete Security Follow-Up: Evidence suggests that corrective measures from a past security incident have not been fully implemented, leaving potential vulnerabilities unpatched. Opaque Governance: A lack of transparency and rationality in the project’s procedures for making major changes, leaving the community in the dark about key decisions. Insufficient Disclosure: Failure to properly disclose important matters to investors and the exchange, violating fundamental principles of trust and communication. What Does a Delisting Watchlist Mean for MASA Holders? For current investors, the MASA delisting watchlist status creates immediate uncertainty. However, it is crucial to understand the process. A watchlist is a precursor to potential delisting, not the event itself. This period is a final chance for the MASA project team to demonstrate concrete improvements and satisfy Coinone’s requirements. During this watch period, trading of MASA on Coinone typically continues. However, the announcement often triggers market volatility. Investors should monitor official communications from both Coinone and the MASA project team closely. The key question is: Can the MASA team provide verifiable proof that they have resolved the cited issues within the given timeframe? How Can the MASA Project Respond to This Warning? The path forward for MASA is challenging but defined. To avoid a full delisting, the project leadership must take swift, transparent, and verifiable action. First, they must publicly address each of Coinone’s concerns with detailed plans and evidence. Second, they need to enhance their communication channels, ensuring all stakeholders are informed about significant changes. Finally, implementing and documenting robust security protocols is non-negotiable. This situation serves as a powerful case study for other crypto projects. Exchanges like Coinone are increasingly acting as gatekeepers, enforcing standards that protect users. The era of operating without clear governance and security is rapidly closing. Projects that prioritize these elements will build stronger, more resilient communities. Key Takeaways from the MASA Delisting Watchlist Announcement Coinone’s action reinforces several critical lessons for the broader cryptocurrency market. It highlights the growing importance of exchange oversight in an industry maturing beyond its wild west phase. For investors, it underscores the necessity of due diligence, looking beyond price charts to assess a project’s operational integrity and compliance posture. The MASA delisting watchlist event is ultimately a story about accountability. Whether MASA survives this probation period will depend entirely on its team’s ability to deliver transparency and security—the very foundations of trust in decentralized finance. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) What is a delisting watchlist? A delisting watchlist is a probationary status where an exchange flags a cryptocurrency for potential removal due to compliance, security, or operational issues. The project is given a set period to address these concerns before a final delisting decision is made. Can I still trade MASA on Coinone during the watchlist period? Yes, trading usually continues during the watchlist period unless Coinone issues a specific trading suspension notice. However, investors should be aware of potentially high volatility and monitor official announcements. How long will MASA be on the watchlist? Coinone stated the watch period will last “about a month.” The exact timeline should be confirmed via Coinone’s official公告. What happens if MASA gets delisted from Coinone? If delisted, MASA trading pairs would be removed from Coinone. Investors would need to withdraw their MASA tokens to a private wallet or another supporting exchange before the withdrawal deadline closes. Does this affect MASA trading on other exchanges? Not directly. Coinone’s decision is specific to its platform. However, other exchanges may review their own listings based on the issues Coinone identified, making this a pivotal moment for the project’s reputation. What should MASA holders do now? Holders should closely follow official updates from both Coinone and the MASA project team. Assess the project’s response to the cited issues and make informed decisions based on the transparency and speed of their corrective actions.

Final 90K Tokens Left While ETH Futures Buzz Grows and XRP Shows Strategic Momentum,https://timestabloid.com/could-bullzilla-be-the-next-100x-crypto-final-90k-tokens-left/,"Crypto never stays quiet, it sprints in like someone yelling, “Who touched my bags?!” Markets are buzzing again as major networks announce upgrades, trading floors heat up, and new contenders roar into view. Ethereum climbs on innovation-driven confidence. XRP reminds investors how volatility can become a strategy. And overshadowing the meme galaxy is BullZilla, smashing presale milestones and rewriting what early-stage momentum looks like. BullZilla rises with a cinematic storyline, disciplined tokenomics, and a scarcity engine that’s tightening by the day. With less than 90K tokens left, investors are racing to catch the final allocation. The project positions itself as a standout challenger for the next 100x crypto title, powered by a community that grows louder with every stage progression. BullZilla Presale at a glance Stage: Stage 13 (Zilla Sideways Smash) Phase: 3 Current Price: 0.00033905 Presale Tally: Over $1M+ Raised Token Holders: Over 3700 Tokens Sold: Over 32 B Current ROI: ($1,454.75% ) from Stage 13C to the Listing Price of $0.00527 ROI until Stage 13C for the Earliest Joiners: $5,796.52% $1000 Investment =2.949 million $BZIL Tokens Upcoming Price Surge = 1.96% increase in 13D from 0.00033905 to 0.00034572 BullZilla Stage 13C Delivers 1,454% ROI: And Stage 13D Adds Another 1.96% Soon BullZilla ($BZIL): The Next 100x Crypto Contender Smashing Into the Market BullZilla delivers the next 100x crypto energy instantly, blending a mythical lore universe with one of the most polished meme-brand identities in the space. The Zilla DNA storyline, multidimensional battles, and lore-based culture make the project feel alive,giving holders emotional investment beyond just price action. Community-driven branding becomes rocket fuel for visibility and on-chain traction. The tokenomics deepen that appeal. BullZilla’s deflationary framework gradually reduces available supply, reinforced by a recent burn of 666,666 BZIL tokens,a standalone scarcity boost not linked to presale stages. Combined with predictable price increases every 48 hours or every $100K raised, the supply curve tightens as demand accelerates. With Stage 13C nearing its cap, scarcity-driven pressure continues to rise. How a $5,000 Shot Turns Into a Zilla-Sized Bag (With Post-Listing Value) A $5,000 entry at the Stage 13C price of $0.000339050 secures roughly 14.745 million BZIL tokens, valued at about $77,700 at the confirmed listing price of $0.00527,a massive built-in upside before trading even begins. After listing, BullZilla’s burn mechanics, presale momentum, and narrative-powered brand strength could amplify that value further as liquidity builds. It’s like snagging Avalanche before the training wheels came off,except this time, the mascot breathes fire. How to Join BullZilla Presale Before the Next Price Jump Head to the official BullZilla presale dashboard, connect a wallet, choose a payment token, and secure BZIL before Stage 13C sells out, with fewer than 90K tokens remaining. A 10% bonus is available on $50+ purchases with a referral code, plus 10% referral earnings from friends’ buys. Rewards unlock two weeks after purchase. Stage 13D activates soon with a 1.96% price increase, and every new stage automatically raises the BullZilla price as funds enter or time expires. Ethereum ($ETH): Vitalik’s Gas Futures Proposal Ignites Market Momentum Ethereum climbed 2.96% to $3,137.59 in 24 hours following Vitalik Buterin’s push for an on-chain, trustless gas futures market. This proposal introduces a forward-pricing mechanism for block space, enabling users to lock in future gas rates and hedge against volatility, even when fees are currently low. The concept aims to improve cost predictability for developers and heavy network users. Industry analysts view this as a structural evolution rather than an experimental idea. A BASEFEE futures market could become a key element of Ethereum’s long-term infrastructure, strengthening its role as the settlement layer for global on-chain activity. Traders watching Ethereum price today see this development as a strong foundational catalyst for future demand. XRP ($XRP): Price Up 1.43% as Volatility Insights Reshape Investor Strategy XRP increased 1.43% to $2.08 over the past 24 hours as analysts revisited its historical volatility patterns. XRP’s sharp surges and sudden pullbacks continue to serve as a case study for risk-aware investors. Lessons such as dollar-cost averaging, stop-loss planning, take-profit automation, and sentiment tracking remain central themes in its price behavior analysis. Regulatory developments still influence XRP heavily, prompting traders to adjust strategies quickly. These insights now align with broader discussions around modeling tools such as Cardano price prediction and extended Cardano 2025 price frameworks. XRP’s chart remains a valuable resource for understanding real-time market reactions. Conclusion Crypto markets show renewed strength as Ethereum pushes structural innovation and XRP delivers clarity through volatility analysis. These developments increase momentum behind opportunities in the next 100x crypto sector, where early positioning becomes crucial. BullZilla leads that conversation. With over $1M raised, 3,700+ holders, 32B+ tokens sold, and an ROI of 1,454.75% from Stage 13C to listing, the project is hitting major milestones. Less than 90K tokens remain in the current phase, and the recent 666,666-token burn adds further scarcity pressure,not tied to stages, but boosting long-term value. As Stage 13D approaches, urgency grows with every minute.

This obstacle arises despite their approval of a law specifically designed for stablecoins this summer. As the lawmakers seek to develop a bill that would establish clear regulations for the crypto market and safeguard clients, Ohio Republican Senator Bernie Moreno expressed his disapproval with the recent bill talks. According to him, a discussion on a bill to oversee the crypto industry is “somewhat frustrating.” Meanwhile, sources close to the situation hinted that Democrats and Republicans are set to meet on Tuesday, December 9. Discussions in a broader bill spark concerns in the crypto industry During the Blockchain Association Policy Summit held in Washington, D.C. on Monday, December 8, Moreno highlighted the ongoing discussion regarding what should be included in a broader bill. The United States Senator argued, “I don’t want to push through a bad bill just to say we passed something.” According to him, there is no better deal than a bad deal. The following day, Moreno announced his intention to meet with Democrats. When reporters inquired about the reason behind this meeting, the Senator mentioned that they would give these democrats room to weigh in on their point of view on this discussion. However, he complained that over the past few weeks, their opinions have been pretty annoying. In the meantime, reports noted that the House and Senate are developing different versions of a market structure bill that must be reconciled. Notably, the House approved its version of a bill in July. This bill, known as the Digital Asset Market Clarity Act or Clarity for short, focused on regulating the crypto ecosystem. Following this approval, reports noted that passing bills in the Senate poses a greater challenge than in the House. Regarding Moreno’s concerns about recent bill talks, analysts discovered that the Senator is a member of the Senate Banking Committee. This committee plays a crucial role in drafting its own version of a crypto market structure bill. Under the leadership of Republicans, it managed to create a draft that aims to define jurisdiction between two key agencies in the crypto industry: the SEC and CFTC. This draft also seeks to introduce a new term to categorize ancillary assets. This term will clarify which type of cryptocurrencies are not viewed as securities. To achieve these goals, sources suggested that the Senate Banking Committee should collaborate with the Senate Agriculture Committee. This proposal was raised after last month’s reports highlighted that the Agriculture Committee shared a draft law that would give new power to the CFTC. Both bills must undergo an important process to implement changes before they can be made available for voting during congressional hearings. Uncertainties surround the upcoming committee’s markup hearing Following the existence of the two bills, a reliable source shared an audio made last week, revealing that Tim Scott, the Chair of the Senate Banking Committee and a Republican from South Carolina, assured the audience at a “Crypto Christmas” event that there is a practical way to have the committee’s markup hearing on December 17 or 18. However, Senator Mark Warner, a Democrat from Virginia, insisted that it would be difficult to finalize the markup hearing before the holidays. Warner made this statement during a discussion with Eleanor Terrett of Crypto In America. According to him, what they are waiting for at the moment is guidelines from the White House on matters concerning quorum and ethics. Notably, Warner is also a member of the Senate Banking Committee. Crypto In America initially hinted at the expected timing of the markup. Want your project in front of crypto’s top minds?

However, a major breakthrough has arrived for the Sui ecosystem. The digital asset tax platform ZenLedger now officially supports the Sui network, promising to transform a complex chore into a streamlined process. This integration is a game-changer for anyone using SUI, aiming to demystify Sui tax reporting and ensure users stay compliant with evolving regulations. What Does the Sui and ZenLedger Integration Mean for You? This partnership directly tackles one of the biggest pain points in crypto: tax preparation. ZenLedger’s system automatically pulls transaction data from the Sui blockchain. It then aggregates this information with data from your exchanges, wallets, and other DeFi activities. Therefore, instead of manually tracking hundreds of transactions, you get a unified, standardized report. This service is crucial for users, developers, and businesses building on Sui who need accurate financial records. How Does ZenLedger Simplify Sui Tax Reporting? ZenLedger operates by connecting to your crypto activity across the board. For Sui users, the process becomes remarkably simple. First, you connect your Sui wallet addresses to the ZenLedger platform. Then, the software automatically: Imports Transactions : Fetches all your SUI transfers, DeFi interactions, and staking rewards. Calculates Gains/Losses : Applies accounting methods (like FIFO or LIFO) to determine your taxable income. Generates Reports : Creates ready-to-file forms such as IRS Form 8949 and Schedule D for the US, with similar reports for other countries. This automation eliminates human error and saves countless hours, making Sui tax reporting less of a seasonal headache and more of a background process. Why Is Accurate Crypto Tax Compliance So Critical? As governments worldwide increase scrutiny on digital assets, proper reporting is no longer optional. The consequences of inaccurate filings can include penalties, interest charges, or audits. Moreover, for the Sui network to achieve mainstream adoption, it must provide users with tools for real-world financial compliance. This integration with a trusted platform like ZenLedger adds a layer of legitimacy and practicality. It signals that the Sui ecosystem is maturing and addressing the full lifecycle of asset management, not just the technological innovation. Actionable Insights for Sui Network Participants If you’re active on Sui, now is the perfect time to get your records in order. Start by reviewing your transaction history across all Sui applications. Consider using ZenLedger or a similar service before the tax year ends to avoid a last-minute scramble. For developers, this integration is a feature you can highlight to attract users who are concerned about compliance. Ultimately, simplifying Sui tax reporting removes a significant barrier to entry and participation. Conclusion: A Major Step Toward Mainstream Crypto Adoption The collaboration between Sui and ZenLedger is more than a technical add-on; it’s a vital infrastructure upgrade. By seamlessly integrating tax compliance into the user experience, Sui is positioning itself as a forward-thinking, user-friendly blockchain. This move alleviates a major source of anxiety for crypto enthusiasts and paves the way for more confident and widespread use of SUI and its applications. In essence, it turns a complex regulatory challenge into a simple, automated solution. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q: Do I need to use ZenLedger if I only have a small amount of SUI? A: Tax obligations typically depend on your jurisdiction’s laws, not the amount. Even small transactions can generate taxable events. Using a platform like ZenLedger helps ensure you don’t miss anything. Q: Can ZenLedger handle my Sui DeFi and staking activities? A> Yes. The integration is designed to pull data from various activities on the Sui network, including decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols and staking rewards, which are often complex to calculate manually. Q: Is my financial data safe with ZenLedger? A> ZenLedger uses read-only access via API keys or wallet addresses. It cannot move your funds. The company also employs bank-level security encryption to protect your data. Q: How does this help if I use multiple blockchains besides Sui? A> This is a key benefit. ZenLedger aggregates data from hundreds of sources. Your Sui tax reporting will be combined with your activity from Ethereum, Solana, or other networks into one comprehensive report. Q: What’s the first step to start using ZenLedger for my Sui taxes? A> Simply create an account on ZenLedger’s website and follow the prompts to connect your Sui wallet addresses. The platform will guide you through the rest. Share This Insight Did you find this guide to simplified Sui tax reporting helpful?

The analyst summed it up by saying DOGE is “licking the bottom of its monthly Ichimoku cloud.” Dogecoin Hovers At Key Monthly Ichimoku Support The 1-month DOGE/USDT chart on Binance, captured on 7 December 2025, shows Dogecoin at around $0.14050, down about 3.8% for the month so far. The monthly candle opened at $0.14599, reached a high of $0.15340 and a low of $0.13177, underlining relatively tight but clearly downward monthly price action. On the chart, the Ichimoku indicator uses standard 9-26-52-26 settings. The fast conversion line (Tenkan-sen) currently sits near $0.20092, and the base line (Kijun-sen) around $0.27491. The leading spans that form the cloud are plotted near $0.23792 and $0.26674, producing a forward-projected red Kumo that extends well into 2026. Related Reading: Analyst Says Dogecoin Price Is Ready To Fly, Here’s Why With DOGE at roughly $0.14, price is trading far below both Tenkan and Kijun and is positioned just at the lower boundary of the projected cloud. That lower cloud edge, which bends into the low-$0.12 to mid-$0.13 area before flattening, is the zone highlighted by Cantonese Cat. The October monthly candle shows a long lower wick that briefly pierced deep below, toward the mid-$0.06 region, but closed back above the cloud floor. The current, still-forming candle again tests just under that boundary and is, at the time of the snapshot, holding marginally above it around $0.14. Related Reading: Dogecoin Bulls Smell $1.30 As On-Chain Data Turns Red-Hot For Ichimoku practitioners, the lower Kumo boundary is often treated as the final structural support in a still-constructive higher-timeframe trend. In this case, the implication of the chart is clear: as long as monthly closes remain above roughly $0.12–$0.14, the multi-year structure can still be interpreted as a long-term bottoming zone rather than a completed breakdown. In other words, for this analyst, Dogecoin’s prospective bottom hinges on whether that monthly Ichimoku support band in the $0.12–$0.14 range continues to hold. DOGE Sits Inside Key Support Zone In The Weekly Chart On the weekly DOGE/USDT chart, price is sitting directly in the highlighted red support zone around $0.135–$0.145. This band coincides with a prior multi-week consolidation area and a former horizontal resistance level that capped price before the last major breakout. Over the past several candles, weekly closes have clustered inside this zone while wicks repeatedly probe through it, underlining how aggressively the market is testing this level. The current candle trades near $0.14392, keeping Dogecoin inside the upper half of the support block but still below the 20-, 50-, 100- and 200-week EMAs, with the 200-week EMA at $0.15563 now just overhead. At the same time, DOGE has clearly lost the rising black trendline that had connected higher lows from the left side of the chart. After breaking beneath this trend support, the DOGE price dropped sharply. The intersection of the broken trendline and the nearby moving averages now forms an overhead supply region, meaning price is compressing between these levels and the red horizontal support zone.

55526643,641936,1765245647,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/55526643.jpeg,Where Are the Sellers? Low Bitcoin Inflows Hint At Holder Conviction Amid Deepest Pullback of 2025,https://bitcoinist.com/low-bitcoin-inflows-hint-at-holder-conviction/,"Bitcoin is attempting to reclaim the $92,000 level as bullish momentum gradually returns after weeks of uncertainty. The market has spent nearly two months in a corrective phase, shedding roughly 36% from its highs, yet signs of stabilization are beginning to emerge. A new CryptoQuant report from analyst Darkfost highlights a striking deviation from typical mid-cycle correction behavior—one that may explain why sentiment is starting to shift. According to the report, inflows of cryptocurrencies onto Binance remain unusually low, even as Bitcoin has experienced one of its deepest pullbacks of the cycle. Historically, during significant corrections, investors tend to send large amounts of BTC and other assets to exchanges, signaling growing willingness to sell and escalating market fear. This pattern appeared repeatedly in past downturns, often marking periods of capitulation. But this time, the data suggests something different: investors are not rushing to offload their holdings. Instead, they appear more comfortable holding through volatility, showing patience rather than panic. Such low inflows contrast sharply with prior mid-cycle resets and hint at a more resilient market structure beneath the surface—one where holders may be preparing for the next phase rather than abandoning ship. A Shift in Inflows Reveals Unusual Investor Behavior Darkfost notes that today’s data shows a markedly different behavior from what Bitcoin typically displays during major corrections. Instead of focusing on BTC alone, the analysis aggregates total inflows of all cryptocurrencies sent to Binance, offering a broader view of market intent. The logic behind this metric is straightforward: rising inflows signal growing selling pressure, while shrinking inflows indicate that investors prefer to hold rather than exit their positions. During previous downturns, inflows surged. In April 2024, right after Bitcoin hit a new all-time high at $73,800, total inflows exceeded 200 million coins, reflecting intense selling pressure. A similar spike appeared in December 2024, as BTC broke above $100,000, signaling that investors were preparing to lock in profits. Today’s environment looks nothing like those periods. Despite experiencing a much deeper correction, inflows are five times lower—and notably stable. Investors are not sending coins to exchanges, which means they’re not eager to sell. Instead, they are sitting through the decline, showing patience rather than panic. This unusual calm suggests a more confident market structure. If selling pressure continues to fade, this investor restraint could become one of the most constructive signals supporting a future bullish recovery once the correction runs its course. Bitcoin Price Action Shows Early Signs of Stabilization Bitcoin’s latest 3-day chart shows the market attempting to stabilize after a sharp two-month correction that pushed the price from above $120,000 to the recent lows near $84,000. The current rebound toward $91,960 reflects improving short-term sentiment, but the broader structure still leans bearish until key levels break. One of the most important developments is BTC’s interaction with the 200-day moving average (red line). The price dipped below it during the flush-out but has now reclaimed it slightly, a signal that sellers may be losing momentum. Historically, regaining the 200MA on high timeframes marks the first stage of recovery after major corrections. However, confirmation requires follow-through and stronger volume—something that remains limited for now. The 50MA and 100MA sit well above price, reflecting the depth of the recent decline and acting as overhead resistance. The clustering of these moving averages between $100,000 and $110,000 forms a heavy supply zone. Bulls would need several consecutive strong candles to break back into that region. Volume has decreased notably during the rebound, suggesting that buyers are still cautious. Until BTC reclaims the $96K–$98K area—where structural resistance and realized-price bands align—this move remains a relief bounce rather than a confirmed bullish reversal.

According to real-time data from Binance’s USDT market, BTC is currently trading at $89,996.28.

Let’s unpack what’s happening and explore the potential implications of this key Bitcoin price movement. Why Did the Bitcoin Price Fall Below $90,000?

Often, such a break below a major round number like $90,000 can be a technical signal for automated trading systems, leading to increased sell pressure. Furthermore, broader macroeconomic conditions, such as interest rate expectations or geopolitical tensions, frequently impact risk assets like Bitcoin. Therefore, understanding the context behind this Bitcoin price drop is essential for making informed decisions. What Does This Mean for Bitcoin Investors? For holders and traders, a sharp Bitcoin price decline can be unsettling. However, volatility is an inherent characteristic of the cryptocurrency market. Here are key considerations for navigating this dip: Long-Term Perspective: Historical data shows Bitcoin has experienced numerous corrections before reaching new highs. A long-term investment strategy often looks beyond short-term volatility. Risk Management: This event underscores the importance of only investing what you can afford to lose and having a clear exit strategy. Opportunity Assessment: Some investors view significant pullbacks as potential buying opportunities to accumulate assets at a lower price point, a strategy known as “buying the dip.” The current Bitcoin price action serves as a critical reminder of the market’s dynamic nature. How Can You Analyze Future Bitcoin Price Movements? Staying informed is your best defense against market uncertainty. To better anticipate future Bitcoin price trends, consider monitoring these aspects: On-Chain Metrics: Data like exchange inflows/outflows and wallet activity can provide insights into holder behavior. Market Sentiment Indicators: Tools that gauge fear and greed in the market can offer contrarian signals. Macroeconomic News: Keep an eye on central bank announcements and global economic data, as they influence all risk markets. By combining these analyses, you can develop a more nuanced view beyond the daily Bitcoin price quote. Navigating Market Volatility with Confidence The journey of Bitcoin is rarely a straight line upward. Periods of consolidation and correction, like the break below $90,000, are part of its market cycle. The key for participants is not to react impulsively to every Bitcoin price swing but to understand the underlying forces at play. Building knowledge, practicing sound risk management, and maintaining emotional discipline are the pillars of navigating this exciting yet unpredictable asset class. Remember, informed decisions are always more powerful than emotional reactions. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: Is Bitcoin’s drop below $90,000 a cause for panic? A: Not necessarily. While significant, Bitcoin has a history of recovering from such corrections. Panic selling often locks in losses; a calm assessment of your strategy is advised. Q2: Could the Bitcoin price fall further from here? A> It is possible. Markets can trend in one direction. The next major support levels, often around previous consolidation zones, would be key areas to watch. Q3: Should I buy Bitcoin now that the price is lower? A: This is a personal investment decision based on your risk tolerance and goals. “Buying the dip” is a common strategy, but it carries risk if the price continues to decline. Q4: What are the main reasons for this sudden Bitcoin price drop? A> Reasons can include large sell orders, negative market sentiment, broader economic factors, or technical breakdowns triggering automated selling. Q5: How does this affect other cryptocurrencies? A: Bitcoin often sets the trend for the broader crypto market. A major Bitcoin price drop frequently leads to declines across altcoins, a phenomenon known as “Bitcoin dominance.” Q6: Where can I get reliable Bitcoin price information? A: Use reputable cryptocurrency data aggregators and major exchange websites. Cross-reference information from multiple trusted sources for accuracy.

That’s the stark reality Fitch Ratings has presented. The agency warns that U.S. banks with a significant crypto business could face serious consequences, including credit rating downgrades. This news sends a clear signal about the perceived risks of mixing traditional finance with digital assets. What Did Fitch Ratings Say About Banks and Crypto? Fitch Ratings, a leading global credit rating agency, issued a report highlighting a critical tension for banks. On one hand, activities like stablecoin issuance or using blockchain technology offer new paths for profit. On the other, they introduce substantial new risks. The agency specifically stated that banks with large-scale, crypto-related operations may be subject to “negative rating actions.” This is a formal way of saying their credit scores could be lowered. Why Does a Crypto Business Pose a Risk to Banks? You might wonder how a modern crypto business could threaten a century-old bank’s stability. Fitch points to several interconnected dangers that go beyond simple market volatility. Reputation Risk: The crypto sector is still associated with high-profile failures and scandals. A bank’s involvement can damage its trusted image if something goes wrong. Liquidity Risk: Crypto markets can freeze or become unstable rapidly. If a bank needs to access funds tied up in digital assets during a crisis, it might not be able to. Operational Risk: Managing digital assets requires new technology and security protocols, increasing the chance of technical failures or cyber-attacks. Regulatory Risk: The rules for cryptocurrency are still evolving. A bank could face heavy penalties or be forced to abandon profitable ventures if regulations change. These risks, when combined, can weaken a bank’s overall financial profile, which is precisely what credit rating agencies assess. Which Major Banks Are Already in the Crypto Arena? This warning isn’t about hypothetical banks. Fitch’s report mentions that industry giants like JPMorgan, Bank of America, Citi, and Wells Fargo are already involved in the crypto sector. Their activities range from custody services and blockchain projects to facilitating client transactions. This means the warning has direct implications for some of the world’s most influential financial institutions. Their foray into digital assets is now under a microscope, with their creditworthiness potentially on the line. What Does This Mean for the Future of Banking and Crypto? Fitch’s stance creates a significant dilemma. Banks are under pressure to innovate and find new revenue streams, and cryptocurrency presents a major opportunity. However, pursuing this crypto business now comes with a formal warning label from a key player in global finance. This will likely force banks to be extremely cautious. They may slow their expansion, invest more in risk management, or wait for clearer regulations before deepening their involvement. The message is clear: growth in crypto must be balanced against the foundational need for stability and trust. In conclusion, Fitch Ratings has drawn a line in the sand. While acknowledging the potential benefits, the agency has prioritized caution, signaling that reckless expansion into cryptocurrency could erode the very foundations of a bank’s credit strength. For the financial industry, navigating this crypto business landscape will require a careful, measured approach where innovation does not compromise resilience. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) What is a credit rating downgrade? A credit rating downgrade is when an agency like Fitch lowers its score for a company or government. It signals higher risk to lenders, which can make borrowing more expensive and damage confidence. Does this mean banks should avoid crypto completely? Not necessarily. The warning is about “significant” or “large-scale” operations. It encourages banks to manage their crypto involvement carefully and ensure risks are controlled, not to avoid it altogether. How could this affect regular bank customers? If a bank’s rating is downgraded, it might become more cautious with lending or offer less favorable rates to protect its stability. It could also slow the rollout of new crypto-related services to customers. Are all crypto activities equally risky for banks? No. Fitch noted that different activities carry different risk levels. For example, simply using blockchain for internal efficiency is less risky than issuing a public stablecoin that must always be redeemable. What can banks do to mitigate these risks? Banks can invest in robust compliance systems, maintain high liquidity buffers specifically for crypto operations, conduct thorough due diligence, and engage proactively with regulators. Will this stop the adoption of cryptocurrency by traditional finance? It is more likely to slow and shape adoption rather than stop it. Banks will probably proceed more deliberately, with a stronger focus on risk management and regulatory alignment. Found this analysis of banks and crypto business risks insightful?

The real debate now centres on what comes next, with investors increasingly nervous that policymakers will signal a “slower pace” of easing in the months ahead. Still high inflation and a lack of fresh data during the government shutdown have fed “divisions” inside the Fed, according to some investors and analysts. After this week’s likely cut, money markets now lean toward only two more moves by the end of 2026, down from three that were priced in barely a week ago, a shift that matters for Bitcoin and other digital assets that trade closely with global liquidity conditions. In bond markets, the US 10-year Treasury yield hit its highest level since September during Monday’s session, extending selling pressure in Europe and Japan and lending support to the dollar. Higher long term yields tend to tighten financial conditions, a backdrop that can cap risk appetite even as traders talk about rate cuts. Markets Waver As December Cut Bets Firm But Policy Path Remains Unclear Wall Street’s main indexes closed lower on Monday, with most S&P 500 sectors finishing in negative territory while Treasury yields pushed higher. Hopes for a December rate cut firmed after data last week showed consumer spending increased “moderately” toward the end of the third quarter, although investors still want clearer signals on future policy moves from what many see as the most “divided Fed” in years. Derivatives pricing reflects that tension. Traders are now assigning roughly an 89% chance of a 25 basis-point cut on Wednesday, while expectations for additional easing have been trimmed. For crypto markets, any surprise in the statement or the press conference could quickly show up in sharp moves around the $90,000 level. Policy Signals From Beijing And Washington Guide Asian Equities And Crypto Chinese assets remained in the background as Beijing’s top leaders set “domestic demand” as their main economic priority for 2026 while signalling a measured approach to stimulus. Any conviction that China will stabilise growth without aggressive easing could influence regional risk appetite and therefore the broader tone for Asian equities and crypto alike. Monetary policy politics are also in play. Kevin Hassett, seen as a leading candidate to become the next Fed chair, said it would be irresponsible for the Fed to lay out a plan for where it aims to take interest rates over the next six months. The White House National Economic Council director told CNBC that following the economic data remains crucial, a stance that points to more meeting-by-meeting decisions rather than a pre-set easing path. For crypto traders, the coming days look pivotal. Greg Magadini, director of derivatives at Amberdata, said this upcoming week is going to be driven by the FOMC rate decision. “This will set the tone for the EOY sentiment. Odds are shifting toward a -25bps cut, which could set the stage for an end-of-year rally in crypto and risk assets,” he said. He added that Trump is expected to announce his pick for Fed chair in early 2026, with Senate approval to follow and the new chair taking over in May 2026 after Powell. That handover, combined with this week’s decision, is already feeding into long-term positioning in Bitcoin and the rest of the digital asset market, even as prices hold near $90,000 for now.

South Korea’s leading exchange, Bithumb, has announced a critical operational pause. To ensure a smooth and secure transition, Bithumb will temporarily suspend deposits and withdrawals for Ethereum (ETH) and all related assets. This essential measure supports the upcoming Ethereum network hard fork , a significant upgrade to the blockchain’s core protocol. The suspension, effective from 12:00 p.m. UTC, is a standard safety procedure adopted by exchanges worldwide during such events. What Does This Ethereum Network Hard Fork Mean for You? If you use Bithumb, this announcement directly impacts your trading activity. The suspension applies not just to ETH but extends to all tokens built on the Ethereum blockchain and a significant list of 18 Ethereum Layer 2 networks. These Layer 2 solutions, like Arbitrum and Optimism, are popular for their speed and lower fees. Therefore, this is a broad pause affecting a wide ecosystem of assets. The primary goal is to protect user funds during the Ethereum network hard fork , preventing any potential transaction errors or loss that could occur if the network splits temporarily. Why Are Exchanges Like Bithumb Taking This Step? You might wonder why a simple software update requires such a drastic measure. A hard fork is a fundamental change to a blockchain’s rules. Nodes that do not upgrade to the new software will operate on a separate chain from those that do. This creates a period of uncertainty. By suspending movements, Bithumb ensures: Fund Security: No transactions are sent to an incorrect or outdated chain. Network Stability: Allows the upgrade to proceed without exchange traffic interfering. Seamless Integration: Gives the exchange’s technical team time to update their own systems to be compatible with the new chain. This proactive approach is a hallmark of responsible exchange management and is crucial for maintaining trust during essential network upgrades. Which Assets Are Affected by This Suspension? The scope of this suspension is comprehensive. While ETH is the primary asset, the pause encompasses the entire Ethereum ecosystem on Bithumb. This includes: All ERC-20 tokens (like USDT, USDC, SHIB, etc.) Assets on 18 specific Ethereum Layer 2 networks Any other asset whose transaction validation depends on the Ethereum mainnet It is vital to note that trading of these assets within the Bithumb exchange may continue normally. The restriction is solely on moving assets onto or off of the Bithumb platform. Always check Bithumb’s official announcement for the precise list and the most current status. How Should You Prepare as a Trader or Holder? Don’t get caught off guard. With the Ethereum network hard fork imminent, taking a few simple steps can save you from frustration. Plan Your Transactions: Complete any urgent deposits or withdrawals well before the 12:00 p.m. UTC deadline. Monitor Official Channels: Follow Bithumb’s official blog and social media for the “all-clear” announcement once services resume. Understand the Fork: Research the specific hard fork (like the Dencun upgrade) to understand its technical benefits for scalability and fees. Stay Calm: This is a routine operational procedure, not a cause for alarm regarding the safety of your funds on the exchange. The Bigger Picture: Why Hard Forks Are Essential for Ethereum While temporarily inconvenient, these upgrades are the lifeblood of blockchain innovation. Each Ethereum network hard fork introduces improvements that enhance security, efficiency, and functionality. Past hard forks have paved the way for staking, reduced energy consumption, and laid the groundwork for future scaling. This temporary pause by Bithumb is a small price to pay for the long-term health and evolution of the entire Ethereum ecosystem, which benefits all developers and users. Conclusion: A Temporary Pause for Long-Term Gain Bithumb’s decision to suspend ETH and Layer 2 transfers is a standard, safety-first response to a significant Ethereum network hard fork . It underscores the exchange’s commitment to protecting user assets during critical blockchain upgrades. For traders, it serves as a reminder of the evolving nature of cryptocurrency infrastructure. By planning ahead and understanding the reasons behind such measures, you can navigate these events with confidence, knowing they are designed to build a more robust and capable network for the future. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: Can I still trade ETH on Bithumb during the suspension? A1: Typically, yes. The suspension usually applies only to deposits and withdrawals (moving crypto in/out of Bithumb). Trading ETH against other pairs on the exchange’s internal order book often continues as normal. However, always confirm with the latest Bithumb notice. Q2: How long will the suspension last? A2: The duration varies but is usually between a few hours and a couple of days. It depends on the complexity of the hard fork and how quickly the exchange’s technical team can verify network stability. Bithumb will announce when services resume. Q3: Are my funds safe on Bithumb during this time? A3: Yes. The suspension is a preventive measure to ensure fund safety. Your assets remain securely held in Bithumb’s wallets. The action is taken to avoid any technical errors during the chain transition, not because of any security breach. Q4: What is an Ethereum Layer 2 network? A4: Layer 2 networks are separate blockchains built on top of Ethereum (the Layer 1). They process transactions off the main chain to improve speed and reduce costs, then batch-settle the final data back on Ethereum. Examples include Arbitrum, Optimism, and Polygon zkEVM. Q5: Will I receive new forked tokens from this hard fork? A5: Most modern Ethereum hard forks are “upgrade” forks, not “chain-split” forks. This means there is no new competing token created. The network simply upgrades its rules. Exchanges like Bithumb typically only support the upgraded canonical chain. Q6: Do other exchanges also suspend services for hard forks? A6: Absolutely. It is an industry-standard best practice. Major global exchanges like Binance, Coinbase, and Kraken also implement similar temporary suspensions during significant network upgrades to guarantee user protection.

The U.S. Department of Justice announced the plea, revealing a social engineering scheme that siphoned a staggering 4,100 Bitcoin, valued at approximately $371 million, from unsuspecting victims. This case serves as a stark reminder of the persistent threats in the digital asset space. How Did This Massive BTC Phishing Scam Operate? According to court documents, the criminal group executed a complex fraud between October 2023 and May 2024. Their primary weapon was a fraudulent online gaming platform that operated in states including California and Connecticut. This was not a simple hack; it was a calculated BTC phishing scam built on deception. The conspirators used social engineering tactics to lure users. They likely promised high returns, exclusive gaming experiences, or fake investment opportunities within the platform. Once users engaged and connected their crypto wallets, the thieves stole their funds. The scale—4,100 BTC—highlights how effective and damaging this type of scam can be. What Does a Guilty Plea Mean for Crypto Crime? The guilty plea is a significant victory for law enforcement. It signals that authorities are improving their ability to track, apprehend, and prosecute individuals involved in complex crypto crimes. This particular BTC phishing scam involved cross-state operations, making the investigation challenging. However, the plea also brings hope for victim restitution. While recovering all stolen funds is often difficult, successful prosecution can lead to asset seizures and court-ordered repayments. This case sets a precedent, showing that even in the seemingly anonymous world of cryptocurrency, illegal actions have serious consequences. How Can You Protect Yourself from Phishing Scams? This incident underscores the critical need for vigilance. Phishing scams are evolving, moving beyond fake emails to elaborate fake platforms. Here are actionable steps to protect your assets: Verify Platform Authenticity: Always double-check website URLs and official social media channels. Look for spelling errors and poor design, which are common red flags. Use Hardware Wallets: For significant holdings, never store all your crypto on an exchange or in a hot wallet connected to dApps or gaming sites. A hardware wallet provides an essential air gap. Enable Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA): Use MFA on all accounts related to your crypto activity. This adds a crucial layer of security beyond just a password. Be Skeptical of “Too Good to Be True” Offers: High-yield promises in gaming or DeFi are major warning signs. Legitimate platforms rarely guarantee extravagant returns. The Lasting Impact of This Landmark Case This guilty plea is more than just a news headline. It represents a growing crackdown on digital asset fraud and a clear message from the Department of Justice.

This crucial milestone represents more than just another technical update—it’s a gateway for builders to finally deploy scalable applications on a production-ready Layer 2 solution. For developers who have been navigating Ethereum’s congestion and high fees, the MegaETH mainnet beta offers a promising alternative that could transform how decentralized applications are built and experienced. What Does the MegaETH Mainnet Beta Mean for Developers? The Frontier release marks MegaETH’s transition from test environments to a live, developer-facing platform. Unlike previous testnets, this MegaETH mainnet beta provides the actual infrastructure where applications will eventually serve real users. Developers gain early access to deploy and test their dApps in an environment that mirrors final production conditions. This phased approach allows the MegaETH team to identify and resolve potential issues before opening the platform to general users, ensuring a smoother experience for everyone involved. Following the initial release to developers, the platform will undergo several weeks of intensive testing and optimization. During this critical period, the MegaETH team will provide dedicated support for application deployment, debugging, and performance tuning. This developer-focused phase demonstrates MegaETH’s commitment to creating a robust foundation rather than rushing to market. The careful rollout strategy reflects industry best practices for launching complex blockchain infrastructure. Why Should Developers Pay Attention to This Launch? The MegaETH mainnet beta arrives at a time when Ethereum scaling solutions are becoming increasingly competitive. However, MegaETH distinguishes itself through several key features that developers will find compelling: Production-Ready Environment: Test your applications under real network conditions Dedicated Support: Receive direct assistance during the deployment phase Early Advantage: Position your dApp ahead of the competition before user onboarding begins Feedback Integration: Help shape the platform’s final features through your testing experience For blockchain developers, accessing the MegaETH mainnet beta represents a strategic opportunity. Early adopters can optimize their applications, identify potential integration challenges, and establish their presence on what could become a major Layer 2 ecosystem. The weeks following the Frontier release will be particularly valuable for teams looking to perfect their user experience before the platform opens to the public. What Comes After the MegaETH Mainnet Beta Release? The deployment timeline follows a logical progression designed to maximize stability and user experience. After the developer-focused phase concludes, MegaETH will begin onboarding regular users to the platform. This staggered approach serves multiple purposes: it allows developers to refine their applications based on real testing data, enables the MegaETH team to scale infrastructure gradually, and ensures that when users finally arrive, they encounter polished, functional dApps rather than experimental prototypes. This careful rollout strategy addresses common pitfalls in blockchain launches where platforms open to users before applications are ready. By prioritizing developer experience first, MegaETH increases the likelihood that users will find compelling applications immediately available. The success of any Layer 2 solution ultimately depends on the quality of applications running on it, making this developer-first approach particularly strategic. How Does This Impact the Broader Ethereum Ecosystem? The MegaETH mainnet beta contributes to Ethereum’s ongoing scaling narrative by providing another viable option for developers seeking affordable, fast transaction processing. As more Layer 2 solutions reach maturity, the entire ecosystem benefits from increased competition, innovation, and choice. Developers now have additional options when deciding where to deploy their applications, while users gain access to more scalable dApps across different platforms. However, challenges remain. The proliferation of Layer 2 solutions creates fragmentation concerns, and developers must consider interoperability between different scaling solutions. The MegaETH team will need to address these ecosystem-wide considerations as their platform matures. Nevertheless, the arrival of another production-ready scaling solution represents positive momentum for Ethereum’s long-term scalability goals. Conclusion: A Strategic Step Forward for Ethereum Scaling The MegaETH mainnet beta Frontier release represents a calculated, developer-focused approach to launching Layer 2 infrastructure. By prioritizing application development and testing before user onboarding, MegaETH increases the platform’s chances of delivering a polished, functional ecosystem from day one. For developers, this provides a valuable window to prepare their applications and potentially gain first-mover advantages in a new scaling environment. As the Ethereum ecosystem continues to evolve toward a multi-Layer 2 future, solutions like MegaETH contribute to the diversity and resilience of the network. The coming weeks will reveal how developers respond to this new option and what innovative applications emerge from the Frontier testing phase. One thing remains certain: the race for Ethereum scalability just gained another serious contender. Frequently Asked Questions When exactly will developers get access to the MegaETH mainnet beta? MegaETH announced that Frontier will be released to app developers next week, though the company hasn’t specified an exact date. Developers should monitor official MegaETH channels for the precise launch timing. How long will the developer testing phase last? The platform will undergo “several weeks” of support for app deployment and testing before user onboarding begins. This suggests developers will have at least 3-4 weeks to work with the MegaETH mainnet beta before it opens to general users. What kind of support will MegaETH provide during testing? While specific details haven’t been released, the announcement mentions “support for app deployment and testing,” which typically includes technical documentation, developer tools, debugging assistance, and potentially direct support channels for early adopters. Can developers deploy production applications immediately? The Frontier release is labeled as a “mainnet beta,” suggesting it’s feature-complete but may still undergo refinements. Developers should treat it as a production-like environment but anticipate possible adjustments before the full public launch. How does MegaETH differ from other Ethereum Layer 2 solutions? While technical specifics weren’t provided in this announcement, MegaETH’s phased rollout strategy distinguishes it through its developer-first approach, prioritizing application readiness before user acquisition. Will there be any incentives for early developers? The announcement doesn’t mention specific incentive programs, but early developers typically benefit from first-mover advantages, platform familiarity, and the opportunity to help shape the ecosystem’s development.

A startling revelation from the Canada Revenue Agency (CRA) suggests many are not. The agency has identified that approximately 40% of cryptocurrency platform users are at a high risk for tax evasion or underreporting. This finding sends a clear message: the era of ambiguous crypto taxation is ending. The CRA is now actively closing legal gaps and pursuing cases, having already recovered millions. Let’s explore what this means for every crypto user in Canada. What Did the CRA Discover About Crypto Tax Evasion? The CRA, through its dedicated cryptocurrency audit program, conducted a risk assessment. It determined that two in five crypto platform users pose a significant compliance risk. This isn’t a minor oversight. The agency is currently investigating over 230 active cases specifically tied to digital assets. Moreover, their efforts have proven financially substantial. Over the past three years, the CRA has collected approximately 100 million Canadian dollars, which is about $73 million USD, from these enforcement actions. This data, reported by Wu Blockchain, highlights a systemic issue in the crypto space. Why Is Crypto Tax Evasion So Prevalent? The CRA itself points to a primary challenge: legal and identification gaps. For years, the pseudonymous nature of blockchain transactions created a gray area. However, the rules have always been clear. In Canada, cryptocurrencies are treated as commodities, and transactions can trigger capital gains or business income. The perceived complexity and anonymity led some users to neglect their obligations. Common pitfalls include: Not reporting trades between different cryptocurrencies (e.g., Bitcoin to Ethereum). Forgetting to declare income from staking, mining, or earning crypto. Incorrectly calculating cost basis and capital gains on disposals. Assuming small transactions or losses don’t need to be reported. How Is the CRA Cracking Down on Tax Evasion? The agency is moving beyond assessments and into direct action. A key strategy involves compelling cryptocurrency platforms to disclose user information. For instance, the CRA has demanded data from companies like Dapper Labs, the creator of NBA Top Shot. This legal pressure on service providers shatters the illusion of complete anonymity. The goal is to obtain records of large or frequent transactions to identify taxpayers who have not voluntarily complied. Therefore, if you trade on a regulated exchange, the CRA can likely access your activity. This crackdown is part of a global trend. Tax authorities worldwide are sharing information and developing tools to track blockchain activity. The message is unambiguous: compliance is no longer optional. What Are the Consequences of Crypto Tax Evasion? The risks are severe and go beyond simply paying the owed tax. If the CRA finds you guilty of tax evasion , you face: Substantial penalties and interest on the unpaid amount. Criminal prosecution in severe cases, which can lead to fines and even imprisonment. A reassessment for multiple years , compounding your financial liability. Damage to your financial reputation and credit score. The collected $73 million demonstrates the CRA’s serious intent and capability. Ignorance of the law is not a valid defense. How Can You Ensure Compliance and Avoid Trouble? Taking proactive steps is crucial. First, understand that all crypto activity must be reported on your annual tax return. Start by gathering complete records of all your transactions, including dates, amounts, and values in Canadian dollars. Consider using a reputable crypto tax software to automate calculations. If you have unreported past transactions, the CRA’s Voluntary Disclosures Program (VDP) may allow you to correct your filings without penalty, though strict conditions apply. Consulting with a tax professional experienced in cryptocurrency is one of the smartest investments you can make to navigate this complex area and prevent crypto tax evasion . In conclusion, the CRA’s 40% high-risk finding is a watershed moment for cryptocurrency in Canada. It signals the end of the wild west phase and the beginning of stringent enforcement. The agency is leveraging legal tools, collecting vast sums, and investigating hundreds. For the responsible crypto user, this underscores the importance of meticulous record-keeping and transparent reporting. The path forward is clear: embrace compliance to secure your financial future and contribute to the legitimate growth of the digital asset ecosystem. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: Does the CRA know I own cryptocurrency? A1: If you use a registered cryptocurrency exchange or platform that operates in Canada, the CRA has the legal authority to request user data. They are actively doing so, making it increasingly likely they can identify holders. Q2: Do I need to pay tax if I haven’t cashed out to Canadian dollars? A2: Yes. Taxable events include trading one crypto for another (e.g., Bitcoin for Ethereum), using crypto to buy goods or services, and earning crypto through activities like staking. It’s not just about cashing out. Q3: What if I only made a few small trades? A3: All transactions, regardless of size, are technically subject to reporting. While the tax owed on small gains might be minimal, failing to report them could still be considered non-compliance if discovered. Q4: Can the CRA track transactions on decentralized wallets? A4: Tracking becomes more difficult but not impossible. If you ever moved funds from a known exchange to a private wallet, that initial link exists. Blockchain analysis tools are also advancing rapidly. Q5: What should I do if I haven’t reported crypto taxes in previous years? A5: You should speak to a tax professional immediately. They can advise you on the best course of action, which may involve using the CRA’s Voluntary Disclosures Program to correct past returns before the agency contacts you. Q6: Are cryptocurrency losses tax-deductible? A6: Yes, capital losses from cryptocurrency can be used to offset capital gains from the same year or carried forward to offset future gains. You must report the transaction to claim the loss. Found this guide on crypto tax evasion risks helpful? Navigating tax rules is essential for every investor.

Is this a strategic accumulation for their own treasury? Could it be for a client’s custody solution? Or is it part of a broader fund management strategy? While the exact purpose isn’t publicly disclosed, the sheer scale demands analysis. Large, traceable moves by reputable firms provide transparency and data points that retail investors rarely see. Why Are Institutional Moves Like This So Important? Institutional activity serves as a key pillar for market maturity. When a firm like Galaxy Digital makes a substantial Galaxy Digital Bitcoin deposit , it validates Bitcoin’s role as a serious institutional asset class. This isn’t speculative day-trading; it’s a calculated allocation of significant capital. Market Confidence: Large deposits can signal long-term belief in Bitcoin’s value proposition, potentially stabilizing prices. Liquidity and Infrastructure: Such moves test and rely on robust custody, settlement, and blockchain infrastructure. Regulatory Clarity: Operating at this scale implies comfort within the existing regulatory framework, encouraging others to follow. Moreover, tracking these flows has become easier with tools like Lookonchain. This transparency is a double-edged sword—it provides valuable insights but also means large players know their moves are watched. Could This Galaxy Digital Transaction Impact Bitcoin’s Price? Direct cause and effect in crypto markets are complex. A single Galaxy Digital Bitcoin deposit of this size is unlikely to cause a sudden price spike on its own. However, it contributes to a larger narrative of institutional accumulation, which can influence market psychology. Consider the following potential impacts: Supply Perception: Moving coins off exchanges into private custody reduces readily available supply, which can be seen as bullish. Sentiment Indicator: It reinforces the idea that sophisticated investors are building positions, not exiting. Network Health: Large transactions demonstrate active use of the Bitcoin network by major financial players. Therefore, while not a direct market order, the psychological and fundamental implications of this deposit are meaningful for overall trend analysis. What Should Crypto Investors Learn From This? For individual investors, the key takeaway isn’t to blindly follow every institutional trade. Instead, use this Galaxy Digital Bitcoin deposit as a learning opportunity. Understand the strategies and patterns of leading firms. It highlights the importance of: On-Chain Analytics: Using tools to monitor wallet activity and large transfers. Macro Trends: Seeing beyond daily volatility to focus on long-term adoption signals. Portfolio Strategy: Considering how institutional adoption might shape future market structure. Galaxy Digital’s action is a data point in a much larger story of digital asset integration into global finance. Conclusion: A Clear Signal in a Noisy Market The recent Galaxy Digital Bitcoin deposit of $81.6 million is a powerful reminder that institutional players are not just observing the crypto space—they are actively participating at a colossal scale. This move underscores a continuing trend of capital allocation to Bitcoin, reinforcing its status as a digital gold for the modern era. For the astute observer, it provides a glimpse into the strategic thinking that drives the upper echelons of crypto finance. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: Who is Galaxy Digital?

Related Reading: ‘Something Big’ Is Coming For XRP, Says Toroso Investments Portfolio Manager As large investors deepen their presence and developers explore changes that could make transaction fees more predictable, sentiment on Wall Street has shifted sharply recently. For many, the combination of tightening supply and improving fundamentals has created conditions that could support a meaningful repricing. Exchange Supply Tightens as Institutions Accelerate Accumulation Ethereum held on centralized exchanges has fallen to its lowest level since the network launched in 2015. Glassnode data shows that balances dropped to 8.7% of the total supply last week, marking a 43% decline since July. The reduction is tied to staking, layer-2 migration, institutional custody, and long-term treasury allocations, destinations that rarely send tokens back to exchanges. BitMine Immersion Technologies, now the largest corporate holder of Ether, expanded its position by another $199 million over the weekend. The firm controls $11.3 billion in ETH, representing about 3.08% of supply, and continues buying toward its 5% target. ETFs have also contributed to the drawdown, with cumulative inflows now above $12 billion. Analysts note that nearly 40% of all ETH is locked in staking or institutional products, creating one of the tightest supply environments the asset has experienced. Technical analysts point to hidden signs of accumulation. Recent On-Balance Volume readings have broken above resistance, even as the price lingers near $3,050, a divergence that some interpret as indicating buying pressure. Fee Reform Pushes Forward as Vitalik Buterin Proposes Gas Futures Market Alongside market activity, a new economic proposal from Vitalik Buterin is drawing attention. The Ethereum co-founder outlined a system for onchain gas futures that would allow users to lock in transaction fees for future time periods. The mechanism resembles traditional futures markets and is designed to help traders and developers hedge against sudden increases in network demand. Buterin argues that clearer forward pricing could support businesses that rely on predictable costs, particularly as activity expands across staking, tokenization, and decentralized applications. Although still in its early stages, the idea is viewed as part of a broader effort to make Ethereum more stable as it scales. Analysts See Conditions Forming for a Larger Cycle Market commentators increasingly cite a combination of shrinking supply, rising institutional involvement, and improving network efficiency as reasons Ethereum may outperform in the next major cycle. Some compare current dynamics to Bitcoin eight years ago, noting that Ethereum’s evolving economic model and expanding role in tokenized finance give it a broader set of drivers than in previous cycles. Related Reading: Trump’s New Security Strategy Leaves Crypto And Blockchain Out Whether these developments immediately translate into price gains remains uncertain. But with exchange balances at record lows and institutions steadily accumulating, analysts agree that Ethereum is entering a structurally different phase, one defined less by speculation and more by sustained demand.

Momentum is building, but the market now awaits to see whether bulls can force a breakout or if a deeper pullback ensues. Ethereum Holds The Line: $3,000 Support Ignites Fresh Upside According to a recent update by analyst Ted Pillows, Ethereum has demonstrated resilience in the face of recent market volatility. The asset successfully held up the crucial $3,000 level and is now showing signs of moving higher, suggesting that this level remains a strong foundation for the current price action. Related Reading: Ethereum Shows Strength: Indicators Suggest Bigger Moves Ahead Ted highlighted a significant external factor contributing to the upward pressure: some large whales have reportedly opened ETH long positions. This institutional or large-scale buying interest has been identified as a major driver fueling the current price move, suggesting that deep-pocketed investors anticipate further appreciation. The analyst provided a clear trigger zone for the next significant leg up. If ETH can break decisively above the $3,300–$3,400 level, it will serve as structural confirmation, expected to trigger a swift rally to the next resistance zone between $3,700 and $3,800. However, Ted also outlined the risk scenario. A failure to break above the $3,300–$3,400 zone could result in the asset turning back down for another retest of the foundational $3,000 zone. Upside Reaction Expected From Major Support Zone In an earlier update, More Crypto Online highlighted that Ethereum is currently reacting from a major weekly support zone, suggesting that an upside move remains likely. However, the analysis also noted the possibility of one more low before a stronger reaction takes shape, keeping both scenarios firmly in play. Related Reading: Ethereum Is Sitting On Its Most Critical On-Chain Support Level — A Rally Emerging? The key resistance area above remains the most important region to watch. Once ETH approaches this zone, the market will essentially be forced to decide which direction it will take over. Both bullish and bearish scenarios remain valid based on the broader market structure. What ultimately shifts the probability toward one side is how ETH behaves at these critical levels. A sustained hold and strong reaction could reinforce the bullish case, while weakness or rejection could signal the opposite. For now, the market is still in the phase before major confirmation. If Ethereum loses support and forms a clear five-wave decline to the downside, the bearish “white scenario” becomes the leading outlook. Until then, the chart simply outlines the conditions that will reveal the market’s preferred path once price makes its next decisive move.

This approach, often called ‘HODLing’ in crypto circles, signals a long-term belief in Bitcoin’s value proposition.

For executives watching this trend, ANAP’s playbook offers actionable insights. First, they set a clear, public goal (1,000+ BTC). Second, they executed purchases steadily, likely averaging into the market. This disciplined approach mitigates volatility risk compared to a single, large buy.

The first major resistance is near the $3,220 level. A clear move above the $3,220 resistance might send the price toward the $3,350 resistance. An upside break above the $3,350 region might call for more gains in the coming days. In the stated case, Ether could rise toward the $3,450 resistance zone or even $3,500 in the near term. Downside Break In ETH? If Ethereum fails to clear the $3,180 resistance, it could start a fresh decline. Initial support on the downside is near the $3,080 level. The first major support sits near the $3,015 zone and the 61.8% Fib retracement level of the upward wave from the $2,914 swing low to the $3,179 low. A clear move below the $3,015 support might push the price toward the $2,975 support. Any more losses might send the price toward the $2,920 region. The next key support sits at $2,840 and $2,820.

Over the past 24 hours, forced crypto liquidations have wiped out millions in leveraged positions, revealing a clear split in trader sentiment between major assets. While Bitcoin bulls faced pressure, bears betting against Ethereum and Zcash took the hardest hits. Let’s break down what these crypto liquidations mean for the market’s direction. What Do These Massive Crypto Liquidations Tell Us? The data paints a clear picture of conflicting expectations. Forced crypto liquidations occur when a trader’s leveraged position suffers such significant losses that the exchange automatically closes it to prevent further debt. This recent wave highlights where traders were most confident—and most wrong. Bitcoin (BTC): $63.27 million liquidated, with 51.99% being long positions. This suggests many traders betting on a price rise were stopped out. Ethereum (ETH): $49.96 million liquidated, but here, 58.16% were short positions. Traders expecting ETH to fall were forced to cover. Zcash (ZEC): A staggering 83.66% of its $14.60 million in liquidations were short positions, indicating a strong, unexpected move against bearish bets. This divergence is crucial. It shows the market is not moving in unison, and asset-specific narratives are driving volatility. Why Are Bitcoin Longs Getting Liquidated? Bitcoin’s price action has been trapped in a range, leading to frustration. When the price fails to break upward, over-leveraged long positions become vulnerable to even small dips. The prevalence of long crypto liquidations for BTC signals that bullish momentum is struggling. Traders may have entered longs expecting a breakout that didn’t materialize, leaving them exposed when support levels were tested. This creates a cascade effect, where each liquidation fuels more selling pressure. How Can Traders Navigate This Volatility? Surviving periods of high crypto liquidations requires discipline and risk management. First, understand that leverage amplifies both gains and losses. Using lower leverage can prevent a minor price swing from wiping out your position. Second, always use stop-loss orders. They won’t always save you from a flash crash, but they are a critical line of defense. Finally, pay attention to funding rates. Persistently high positive rates can signal an overcrowded long trade, which often precedes a flush-out. Remember, these crypto liquidations are not just numbers; they represent real capital being removed from the market, which can impact liquidity and price discovery in the short term. What’s the Outlook After a Liquidation Event? Large-scale crypto liquidations often act as a reset button. They wipe out overextended positions, which can reduce selling pressure (if longs are liquidated) or fuel a short squeeze (if shorts are liquidated). The Ethereum and Zcash data suggest a potential short squeeze occurred, forcing bears to buy back assets to close their positions, ironically pushing prices higher. For Bitcoin, the long liquidations may have removed weak hands, potentially setting the stage for a more stable foundation if buying interest returns. In summary, the recent crypto liquidations underscore the peril and opportunity in leveraged trading. They reveal the market’s fragile consensus and serve as a stark reminder that in crypto, risk management is not optional—it’s essential for survival. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) What are crypto liquidations? Crypto liquidations happen when an exchange automatically closes a trader’s leveraged position because it has lost too much of its initial margin. This prevents the trader’s account from going into negative balance. Why were more Ethereum positions short? A higher percentage of short liquidations for ETH suggests the price moved upwards against traders’ expectations. This could be due to positive news, technical breakout, or a cascade of shorts being forced to buy back ETH, creating a “short squeeze.” Are liquidations bad for the market? They create short-term volatility and pain for affected traders. However, they can also be healthy by removing excessive leverage, which reduces systemic risk and can lead to a more stable price floor. How can I avoid getting liquidated? Use lower leverage, employ sensible stop-loss orders, avoid over-investing in a single trade, and constantly monitor market conditions and your position’s health. Do large liquidations signal a market top or bottom? Not definitively. While massive long liquidations can occur near market bottoms (capitulation) and short liquidations near tops, they are better viewed as indicators of extreme sentiment and leverage being flushed out, not precise timing signals. Where can I track liquidation data? Websites like Coinglass and Bybit provide real-time liquidation heatmaps and data across multiple exchanges, helping traders gauge market sentiment and potential pressure points.

To support a significant network upgrade, Binance will suspend all NTRN deposits and withdrawals starting at 2:00 p.m. UTC on December 10. This planned Binance NTRN suspension is a standard procedure for major blockchain improvements, but it requires user awareness to avoid any trading disruptions. What Does the Binance NTRN Suspension Mean for You? First, do not panic. A temporary suspension for a network upgrade is a routine and positive event in the crypto ecosystem. It signifies progress and enhancement for the Neutron blockchain. However, this Binance NTRN suspension means you will be unable to move your NTRN tokens into or out of your Binance wallet during the maintenance window. Therefore, you need to plan your transactions accordingly. Here is a clear breakdown of what will and will not be affected: Impacted Services: All deposit and withdrawal functions for the Neutron (NTRN) token on Binance. Unaffected Services: Trading of NTRN spot pairs on the Binance exchange will continue as normal during this period. Your assets remain safe in your wallet. Why Are Network Upgrades and Exchange Suspensions Necessary? You might wonder why a leading platform like Binance needs to halt services. The reason is security and synchronization. When a blockchain like Neutron undergoes a core upgrade (often called a hard fork or mainnet upgrade), all network participants, including exchanges, must update their software to the new protocol. If Binance continued processing transactions during the switch, it could lead to lost funds or failed transactions. The temporary Binance NTRN suspension acts as a safety measure. It allows their systems to update seamlessly and ensures that when services resume, everything functions perfectly with the new, improved network. Your Action Plan Before the December 10 Deadline Proactivity is key. To ensure a smooth experience, consider these simple steps before 2:00 p.m. UTC on December 10. Complete Planned Transfers: If you need to deposit NTRN to Binance for trading or withdraw to a private wallet, do so well in advance of the deadline. No Last-Minute Moves: Avoid initiating transactions close to the suspension time, as they may not be processed. Monitor Official Channels: Follow Binance’s official announcements for the exact time when services will be reinstated after the upgrade. Remember, this suspension is for network support. It reflects Binance’s commitment to providing a secure and reliable trading environment. Such upgrades often bring benefits like increased transaction speed, enhanced security features, or new functionality to the Neutron ecosystem. Looking Beyond the Suspension: What’s Next for NTRN? Once the upgrade is complete and the Binance NTRN suspension is lifted, the Neutron network will operate on its upgraded protocol. For users, this should translate to a more robust and efficient experience. Historically, successful network upgrades can have a positive long-term impact on a token’s utility and perception within the market. In conclusion, the scheduled pause for NTRN on Binance is a standard operational procedure for a significant technological step forward. By understanding the reason behind it and taking simple preparatory actions, you can navigate this brief interruption without issue. The ultimate goal is a stronger, more capable Neutron blockchain for all participants. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: Can I still trade NTRN on Binance during the suspension? A1: Yes. The suspension only affects deposits and withdrawals. Spot trading of NTRN trading pairs will continue normally on the Binance exchange. Q2: How long will the Binance NTRN suspension last? A2: Binance has not specified an end time. The suspension begins at 2:00 p.m. UTC on Dec. 10 and will last until the network upgrade is stable and their systems are updated. Users should monitor Binance’s official announcements for the resumption notice. Q3: Are my NTRN tokens safe on Binance during this time? A3: Absolutely. Your assets remain secure in your Binance wallet. The suspension is a preventive measure to ensure the safety of funds during the technical transition. Q4: What happens if I send NTRN to my Binance deposit address during the suspension? A4: Transactions sent during the suspension period will not be credited and could be lost. It is crucial to wait until Binance officially confirms that deposit services have resumed before sending any NTRN. Q5: Will other exchanges also suspend NTRN services? A5: It is highly likely. Most major exchanges supporting NTRN will announce similar suspension periods to perform their own network upgrades. Always check the announcements from the specific exchange you use. Q6: Where can I get the most reliable updates on this situation? A6: The only source for definitive information is the official Binance Announcements page or their verified social media channels. Avoid relying on unofficial sources or rumors. Found this guide on the Binance NTRN suspension helpful?

According to a report posted by the agency, Fitch Ratings maintained that although crypto integrations, which have the potential to increase fees, yields, and efficiency, bring “reputational, liquidity, operational, and compliance” benefits, they are generally risky for banks. U.S. banks race into crypto amid opportunities and risks Several leading American lenders , including JPMorgan Chase, Bank of America, Citigroup, and Wells Fargo, have announced initiatives over the last few months to offer digital asset services. Regulations will be updated to accommodate these changes. The current legislative focus, particularly the GENIUS Act and the CLARITY Act, could pave the way for the widespread adoption of stablecoins, enabling a seismic expansion of participation in digital-asset of ferings. In Fitch’s view, such developments offer banks a chance to boost fee income, increase yields, streamline operations, and modernize services — all of which appeal to institutions seeking growth in a challenging macroeconomic environment. Fitch stated that stablecoin issuance, deposit tokenization, and the utilization of blockchain technology offer banks opportunities to improve customer service. They also enable banks to leverage blockchain’s speed and efficiency in areas such as payments and smart contracts. Fitch warned that it could reassess the business models or risk profiles of U.S. banks with concentrated digital-asset exposures, which could harm their ratings. The agency noted that while regulatory advancements in the U.S. are paving the way for a safer cryptocurrency industry, banks still face an uphill battle when dealing with digital assets. “However, banks would need to address challenges around the volatility of cryptocurrency values adequately, the pseudonymity of digital asset owners, and the protection of digital assets from loss or theft to adequately realize the earnings and franchise benefits,” said Fit ch Fitch Ratings is part of the United States’ “Big Three” credit rating bodies, along with Moody’s and S&P Global Ratings. Ratings by these firms — which critics debate — have significant clout in the financial sector, shaping the perception of businesses and their appeal to investors. That means that if Fitch were to downgrade a bank with significant crypto exposure, it could lead to reduced investor confidence, higher borrowing costs, and obstacles to growth. The report highlighted that several major banks are also planning to test the crypto sector. On that note, Bank of America Corp. Chief Executive Officer Brian Moynihan, Citigroup Inc. CEO Jane Fraser, and Wells Fargo & Co. CEO Charlie Scharf are scheduled to meet with senators from both parties on Thursday to discuss cryptocurrency market legislation that could soon come to a vote, according to a person familiar with the plans. The discussions, hosted by the Financial Services Forum, a co alition of major banks , are expect ed t o fo cu s on bankers’ opposi ti on to allowing interest payments on stablecoi ns, along w ith the ab il it y of b anks to com pete in the cr ypto s pa c e and preventing the u se of cryptocurr encies to fa ci li tate illicit ac ti vi ties. Stablecoin surge could pose systemic risks to U.S. financial markets Fitch further cautions that another risk may arise from the explosive growth of the stablecoin market, particularly if it becomes large enough to influence other areas and institutions. For example, the large-scale adoption of stablecoins might affect liquidity in the Treasury market or create new channels of financial instability. Financial system risks could also increase if adoption of stablecoins expands, particularly if it reaches a level sufficient to influence the Treasury market. Fitch Moody’s, a major global financial services company, has also recently highlighted the potential systemic risks of stablecoins in a report from late September, arguing that the widespread adoption of stablecoins in the U.S. could ultimately threaten the legitimacy of the U.S. dollar. The company noted that the high penetration of USD-linked stablecoins, in particular, can weaken monetary transmission, especially where pricing and settlement increasingly occur outside the domestic currency.

Within the broader digital asset ecosystem, some platforms offer additional revenue streams for holders of different assets through cloud computing power, node incentives, and cross-chain asset management. In this trend, cloud computing power services like PEPPER Mining have gained attention. These services don’t mine XRP itself, but rather utilize specialized data centers and multi-chain computing infrastructure to allow users to participate in the computing power generation of mainstream networks like BTC and ETH, while continuing to hold XRP as their core asset. The appeal of this model lies in the fact that holders can obtain additional cash flow through external computing power without changing their existing asset structure or deploying any hardware, thereby enriching their overall asset allocation. For many users focused on long-term value and capital flow efficiency, this approach offers a new possibility—making their asset portfolio more “productive” while maintaining XRP holdings. PEPPER Mining: A New Revenue Channel for XRP Users PEPPER Mining offers a completely new answer. As an AI-powered, internationally compliant green cloud mining platform, PEPPER Mining provides intelligent passive income solutions for global users, including XRP investors.

PEPPER Mining’s data centers are located in North America, Europe, and Iceland, all powered by solar, wind, and hydropower, achieving truly low-carbon and green mining. Why do XRP holders need PEPPER Mining? 1. Make your static assets “live”: While waiting for the XRP price to recover, holders can obtain stable income through cloud mining, no longer letting their assets sit idle. 2. Dual-engine income model: On the one hand, holding XRP offers potential appreciation potential; on the other hand, mining generates daily cash flow, achieving a higher overall rate of return. 3.

This initiative is part of a broader digital asset strategy that includes its Digital Asset Network infrastructure connecting to on/off-ramp providers and stablecoin settlements. “We think that we can make a market for our coin in those markets, and we wanted to be able to control the economics, control the compliance, and control the overall distribution, and we think we can grow that beyond that,” Cagwin said.

The card will allow users to store money in stablecoins, keeping their savings’ value even if local currency drops from inflation. pic.twitter.com/El0YdsDAIo — Felix (@Punk1402) December 6, 2025 Western Union announced its plan to launch US dollar Payment Token (USDPT), its new stablecoin, in late October. It also announced a Solana-based “Digital Asset Network designed to bridge the digital and fiat worlds.” “As we evolve into the digital assets space, Western Union’s USDPT will allow us to own the economics linked to stablecoins,” said Devin McGranahan, President and CEO of Western Union at the time. Inflation Soars In These Countries Venezuela has the highest inflation in the world at 172%, according to Trading Economics. South Sudan also has triple-figure inflation. Iran, Haiti, Argentina, and Turkiye all have extreme inflation, ranging from 30% to 45%. Inflation also remains persistently high in many developed countries, such as the UK, Russia, Austria, and Australia, following the pandemic lockdowns. Another problem is that government and central bank inflation figures are often undermeasured and rarely reflect reality. They do not include day-to-day expenses such as groceries and energy bills, which are constantly increasing in most countries.

Acting Chairman Caroline Pham announced the program in Washington, along with new guidance on tokenized collateral and the withdrawal of older rules that no longer align with the GENIUS Act. The pilot marks a shift toward integrating digital assets into futures and swaps markets while giving regulators real time visibility into how tokenized collateral performs. . @CFTCpham Announces Launch of Digital Assets Pilot Program for Tokenized Collateral in Derivatives Markets: https://t.co/okRaxM9aQ9 — CFTC (@CFTC) December 8, 2025 US Derivatives Regulator Opens Path For Tokenized Assets To Back Trades Pham said the initiative aims to give US traders safer, CFTC-supervised venues after heavy losses on offshore platforms. She added that the agency is “launching a US digital assets pilot program for tokenized collateral, including Bitcoin and Ether,” with guardrails for customer protection and tighter monitoring. The CFTC’s three divisions also issued guidance confirming that tokenized assets can be evaluated under the existing framework. The guidance covers tokenized real-world assets such as US Treasuries and money market funds and addresses custody, segregation, valuation haircuts and operational risks. The agency also granted no-action relief for futures commission merchants that want to accept certain non-securities digital assets as customer margin. Pilot Starts With Bitcoin, Ether And USDC As CFTC Gains Fresh Market Visibility For the first three months, FCMs can only accept BTC, ETH and USDC. They must file weekly reports on the amounts held and notify the agency of any major issues, giving the CFTC early insight into market behaviour without blocking adoption. In a parallel move, the CFTC withdrew a 2020 advisory that restricted the use of virtual currencies as collateral, saying it no longer reflects current market conditions after years of development and the passage of the GENIUS Act. Crypto Execs Call CFTC Guidance A Milestone For US Market Innovation Crypto firms welcomed the shift. Coinbase’s chief legal officer Paul Grewal said the decision confirms that digital assets can make payments faster and cheaper. Circle president Heath Tarbert said supervised stablecoins will reduce settlement frictions and support round-the-clock trading. Crypto.com CEO Kris Marszalek called the guidance “an important milestone,” linking it to President Trump’s goal of making the US “the crypto capital of the world.” Ripple’s Jack McDonald added that recognizing tokenized assets as eligible margin improves capital efficiency and strengthens US leadership in financial innovation. The CFTC said the pilot and guidance reflect recommendations from the Digital Asset Markets Subcommittee and feedback from industry forums. Bitcoin, Ether and USDC are set to take on a more formal role in US derivatives markets as regulators monitor how tokenized collateral performs in practice.

After a brief period of optimism, these popular investment vehicles recorded a significant net outflow of $60.5 million on December 8th. This reversal highlights the ongoing volatility and shifting investor sentiment within the cryptocurrency market. What Do the Spot Bitcoin ETF Outflows Mean? Data from analyst Trader T reveals a clear shift. While BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) managed to attract a net inflow of $28.72 million, it was not enough to counter larger withdrawals. The outflows were primarily driven by two major funds, creating a net negative day for the entire spot Bitcoin ETF sector. This single-day reversal is crucial for investors to understand. It demonstrates that demand for these products is not a one-way street. Therefore, monitoring these flow trends is essential for gauging broader institutional and retail interest in Bitcoin through regulated channels. Which ETFs Drove the $60.5 Million Exit? The outflows were concentrated, not widespread. Grayscale’s Mini BTC fund and Fidelity’s Wise Origin Bitcoin Fund (FBTC) were the main contributors to the negative total. Grayscale Mini BTC: This fund saw net outflows of $44.03 million. Fidelity FBTC: This fund experienced net outflows of $39.44 million. Meanwhile, BlackRock’s IBIT was the lone bright spot with its $28.72 million inflow. This divergence shows that even within the same asset class, investor preference can vary significantly between fund providers. How Should Investors Interpret This Volatility? Short-term flow data for spot Bitcoin ETFs can be noisy. A single day of outflows does not necessarily define a long-term trend. However, it serves as a powerful reminder of the market’s sensitivity. Several factors could influence these movements, including: Profit-taking by short-term traders after price increases. Broader macroeconomic concerns affecting risk appetite. Rotation of capital between different ETF providers based on fees or perceived stability. For long-term investors, the key is to look beyond daily fluctuations. The sustained presence of major financial institutions like BlackRock, Fidelity, and Grayscale in the spot Bitcoin ETF space signifies a profound shift in Bitcoin’s adoption journey. What’s the Future for Spot Bitcoin ETFs? The path forward will likely remain bumpy. The market for spot Bitcoin ETFs is still maturing, and days of outflows are to be expected alongside periods of strong inflows. This volatility is inherent to the underlying asset. Yet, the structural importance of these products is undeniable. They provide a secure, familiar, and regulated gateway for traditional investors to gain Bitcoin exposure. This institutional bridge is a cornerstone for the next phase of crypto adoption, even if the daily traffic across it fluctuates. In conclusion, the $60.5 million net outflow is a reality check. It underscores that the journey for spot Bitcoin ETFs and the broader crypto market will be marked by both advances and retreats. Savvy investors should view such data as a piece of a larger puzzle, not the final picture. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) What are spot Bitcoin ETFs? Spot Bitcoin ETFs are exchange-traded funds that hold actual Bitcoin. They allow investors to buy shares that track the price of Bitcoin without needing to directly purchase or store the cryptocurrency themselves. Why did spot Bitcoin ETFs have net outflows? Net outflows occur when the amount of money withdrawn from these ETFs exceeds the amount of new money invested. This can happen due to profit-taking, negative market sentiment, or investors moving capital to other assets. Is a single day of outflows a major concern? Not necessarily. While it indicates shifting short-term sentiment, one day of data does not define a long-term trend. It’s important to watch flow patterns over weeks and months for a clearer picture. How do spot Bitcoin ETF flows affect Bitcoin’s price? Large, sustained inflows can create buying pressure that may support or increase Bitcoin’s price. Conversely, large outflows can create selling pressure. However, many other factors also influence Bitcoin’s price. Should I avoid spot Bitcoin ETFs because of this volatility? Investment decisions should be based on your individual risk tolerance and long-term strategy. Spot Bitcoin ETFs are a volatile asset class. Their daily flows are one of many metrics to consider, not a sole reason to buy or sell. Which spot Bitcoin ETF had inflows on December 8th? BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) was the only major fund among those cited to record a net inflow on that day, attracting $28.72 million.

Each user will have a dedicated in-app digital-asset account that is managed by Hexarq rather than being routed to outside exchanges or third-party wallets. The arrangement keeps custody within the bank’s ecosystem. It also comes with a monthly fee of €2.99 and a trading commission of 1.5% on transactions. Banks Face Fintech Pressure Reports have pointed to the rise of fintech rivals as a driving reason for the move. Companies such as Revolut, Deblock, Bitstack and Trade Republic built early crypto offerings and attracted many retail users. Traditional lenders now risk losing younger customers unless they match those services. Some banks in Europe already offer in-app trading: BBVA supports Bitcoin and Ethereum, Openbank under Santander lists five cryptocurrencies, and Raiffeisen in Vienna provides similar features through a tie-up with Bitpanda. BPCE’s entry follows this trend and could push other big lenders to act.

On December 8th, US spot ETH ETFs collectively attracted $35.49 million in net inflows, signaling renewed institutional confidence in Ethereum-based investment products. This reversal marks a pivotal moment for digital asset funds. What Drove the US Spot ETH ETFs Inflow Surge? The data from TraderT reveals a clear leader in this recovery. BlackRock’s iShares Ethereum Trust (ETHA) dominated the inflows, securing $23.66 million. This substantial figure highlights continued strong demand for products from major traditional finance institutions. Meanwhile, Grayscale’s Ethereum Mini Trust contributed a solid $11.83 million to the total. The remaining US spot ETH ETFs in the market showed no net change, indicating the flows were concentrated in these two prominent funds. Why Does This Reversal Matter for Investors? This return to net inflows for US spot ETH ETFs is more than just a single day’s data point. It represents a potential shift in market sentiment. After a period of outflows, this influx of capital suggests that institutional investors may see current price levels as an attractive entry point. Furthermore, it demonstrates the growing maturity and resilience of cryptocurrency exchange-traded products. Consider these key implications: Sentiment Indicator: Net inflows often reflect positive investor outlook and confidence in the underlying asset’s future performance. Institutional Validation: Major players like BlackRock continuing to attract capital reinforces Ethereum’s position in diversified portfolios. Market Stability: Consistent interest in US spot ETH ETFs can contribute to overall market liquidity and stability. How Do US Spot ETH ETFs Compare to Broader Trends? The performance of US spot ETH ETFs does not exist in a vacuum. It interacts with broader cryptocurrency market movements, regulatory developments, and macroeconomic factors. This specific inflow event occurred amidst fluctuating Ethereum prices and ongoing discussions about blockchain network upgrades. Therefore, while a positive sign, investors should monitor these funds as part of a wider market context. The concentration of flows into just two of the available US spot ETH ETFs also tells a story. It points to a competitive landscape where brand recognition, fee structures, and liquidity are crucial differentiators for investors choosing where to allocate their capital. What’s Next for Ethereum ETF Investments? The December 8th data provides a hopeful snapshot. However, the true test will be whether this inflow trend sustains itself in the coming days and weeks. Market observers will watch closely to see if this marks the beginning of a longer-term accumulation phase for US spot ETH ETFs or remains a temporary rebound. For prospective investors, this activity underscores the importance of: Tracking daily flow data to gauge institutional momentum. Understanding the specific holdings and strategies of different US spot ETH ETFs. Considering how these investment vehicles fit within a broader, risk-managed crypto asset allocation. In conclusion, the $35.5 million net inflow is a powerful signal of returning confidence. It breaks a short-term negative trend and highlights the pivotal role major financial institutions now play in the digital asset ecosystem through products like US spot ETH ETFs. This movement suggests that sophisticated investors are actively engaging with Ethereum’s investment thesis, looking beyond short-term volatility. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) What are US spot ETH ETFs? US spot ETH ETFs are exchange-traded funds that hold actual Ethereum (ETH) cryptocurrency. They trade on traditional stock exchanges, allowing investors to gain exposure to ETH’s price without directly buying or storing the digital asset. Why did the inflows happen on December 8th? While specific triggers can be complex, inflows often correlate with perceived positive market developments, attractive pricing, or broader institutional investment cycles. The data shows a clear preference for funds from established managers like BlackRock and Grayscale. Is investing in a US spot ETH ETF a good idea? Like any investment, it depends on your individual financial goals, risk tolerance, and research. These ETFs offer a regulated way to access Ethereum but still carry the volatility associated with cryptocurrency markets. How can I track these ETF flows? Data from firms like TraderT, along with disclosures from the fund issuers themselves, provide regular updates on net inflows and outflows. Financial news websites often report on these figures. What’s the difference between ETHA and Grayscale’s Mini ETH Trust? Both are US spot ETH ETFs, but they may differ in management fees, structure, and size. BlackRock’s ETHA is a newer entrant, while Grayscale’s product is a conversion of a pre-existing trust, which can influence investor perception and flows. Could the inflow trend reverse again? Yes, ETF flows can and do change direction based on market conditions. The December 8th data is a single point, and sustained interest over time is a more reliable indicator of long-term sentiment.

Instead of betting on company shares, you invest directly in the raw technological prowess of competing AI models. This is the groundbreaking vision behind Gensyn’s new launch. The company has unveiled Delphi, a pioneering on-chain marketplace dedicated to AI performance verification . This platform transforms how we evaluate, compare, and financially back the open-source models shaping our future. What is Delphi and How Does AI Performance Verification Work? Delphi is not just another analytics dashboard. It is a fully functional, blockchain-based marketplace. At its core, it provides transparent, real-time AI performance verification through standardized benchmarks. For instance, it features Gensyn’s own mid-range general-purpose inference benchmark. Users can view live results and data, creating an unprecedented level of transparency in a field often shrouded in proprietary secrecy. The mechanism is elegantly simple yet powerful. Different open-source models, like Llama or Mistral variants, run the same tasks. Their performance—speed, accuracy, efficiency—is measured and posted on-chain. This creates a live leaderboard of technological capability, free from corporate marketing spin. How Can You Actually Invest in AI Models? This is where Delphi gets truly innovative. The platform allows users to place financial bets, or investments, on which models they believe will lead the performance rankings. It utilizes an LMSR-based (Logarithmic Market Scoring Rule) automated market maker (AMM). No Order Books: Unlike traditional exchanges, there’s no need to match buyers and sellers. You can enter or exit a position instantly. Direct Exposure: Your investment is a direct bet on a model’s technical merit, not the fortunes of a parent company. Performance-Based Rewards: If the model you back achieves a top ranking at the settlement period, you are rewarded. Your profit is tied directly to proven AI advancement. Therefore, Delphi creates a pure financial signal that reflects genuine technological progress, cutting through the noise of the AI hype cycle. Why is Transparent AI Performance Verification a Game-Changer? The current AI landscape is dominated by closed, proprietary models from giant corporations. Their inner workings and true capabilities are often opaque. Delphi challenges this paradigm by putting open-source models—the collaborative engines of innovation—on a public, verifiable stage. Gensyn states this creates a crucial opportunity. Instead of trying to pick winning AI stocks, you can now invest directly in the underlying, democratized technology. This does more than just create an investment vehicle; it aligns financial incentives with open-source development and rigorous, objective testing. What Are the Potential Impacts and Challenges? The potential here is staggering. A robust market for AI performance verification could accelerate the best open-source models by funneling capital and attention to them. It provides a clear, crowd-sourced answer to the question: “Which model actually works best?” However, challenges exist. The quality and relevance of the benchmarks are paramount; they must be fair and meaningful. Furthermore, the market’s success depends on widespread participation to ensure liquidity and accurate price discovery. Navigating the regulatory landscape for such a novel financial instrument will also be a key hurdle. Conclusion: A New Frontier for AI and Crypto Gensyn’s Delphi marketplace is a bold fusion of cryptocurrency mechanisms and artificial intelligence evaluation. By pioneering a trustless system for AI performance verification , it offers a revolutionary way to participate in the AI revolution. It empowers users to support the open-source ecosystem financially while creating a transparent, meritocratic arena where the best technology can rise to the top and be rewarded accordingly. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q: Do I need technical AI knowledge to use Delphi? A: Not necessarily. While understanding benchmarks helps, the platform is designed for any user to view performance rankings and make informed bets based on that public data. Q: What cryptocurrency do I need to participate? A: Specific details will depend on the blockchain Gensyn utilizes. Typically, you would need the native token of that network (like ETH for Ethereum) or a stablecoin to trade on the AMM. Q: How does this differ from buying tokens of an AI crypto project? A> Most AI crypto project tokens represent governance or utility within a specific protocol. A bet on Delphi is a direct financial derivative of a model’s performance score, not ownership of a project. Q: Are the benchmarks biased towards certain types of AI models? A: Gensyn has launched with its own general-purpose benchmark.

Speaking before global regulators, banks, and market leaders, Zhou detailed how Bybit’s full UAE Virtual Asset Platform Operator (VAPO) license is reshaping the exchange’s global positioning and setting new standards for governance, infrastructure resilience, and institutional-grade market access. This new license places Bybit under one of the world’s most robust regulatory regimes, enabling the exchange to offer a complete institutional product stack from a rigorously supervised UAE hub. Vision Rooted in Trust, Scale, and Regulatory Alignment Zhou opened by emphasizing that institutional adoption is accelerating toward firms that can demonstrate both operational scale and regulatory certainty — and Bybit is now positioned to lead that shift. “Bybit’s growth this year reflects a market seeking reliability,” Zhou stated. “Asset inflows rose from USD 1.3 billion in Q3 to USD 2.88 billion in Q4, while our wealth management AUM expanded fivefold from USD 40 million to USD 200 million. Institutions want partners who can scale with discipline, transparency, and governance — and Bybit is delivering exactly that.” Zhou noted that Bybit’s strengthened regulatory status marks an inflection point for the industry. “The UAE’s VAPO license gives institutions what they have been waiting for — a regulatory environment where innovation is supported by rigorous oversight,” he added. “It anchors our compliance-first strategy and sets a model for how global digital finance will mature.” From Retail Strength to Institutional Certainty Zhou highlighted that Bybit’s institutional advantage is built on the strength of its global retail ecosystem — now spanning card, Pay, and fiat integration across 13 regions. This scale enables one of the deepest liquidity pools in the industry, providing measurable execution benefits to institutional desks. He also pointed to accelerated collaboration with major financial institutions in Europe and the Middle East, reinforcing Bybit’s role as a high-reliability execution venue for professional market participants. TradFi and Crypto: A Single Market Within Five Years Looking ahead, Zhou outlined his long-term view of the industry. Rather than parallel financial systems, he predicts a unified capital market driven by shared infrastructure standards, integrated workflows, and interoperable liquidity. “In the next five years, TradFi and crypto will not be two separate worlds,” Zhou said. “We are moving toward a single, globally connected ecosystem built on institutional-grade liquidity, custody, and infrastructure — and Bybit is building the operational backbone for that future.” Commitment to a Safer, High-Performance Institutional Market Zhou closed his keynote by underscoring Bybit’s commitment to create the market’s most trusted institutional trading ecosystem — anchored in transparency, execution speed, and clear regulatory standards. With its expanded regulatory footprint, deepening institutional partnerships, and rapidly scaling liquidity, Bybit is well positioned as a foundational pillar of the global digital asset market heading into an era of rapid institutional adoption in 2026. #Bybit / #CryptoArk About Bybit Bybit is the world’s second-largest cryptocurrency exchange by trading volume, serving a global community of over 70 million users.

The looming Fed decision on interest rates has created a holding pattern across major Asian currencies, injecting a dose of uncertainty into trading floors from Tokyo to Singapore. However, one currency has broken from the pack: the Australian dollar posted notable gains following the Reserve Bank of Australia’s latest policy announcement, providing a clear signal in an otherwise muted session. Why is the Forex Market in a Holding Pattern Ahead of the Fed? The primary force driving current market sentiment is the upcoming Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting. Traders and institutional investors are essentially parked on the sidelines, reluctant to make significant bets until they receive the latest guidance on U.S. monetary policy. The key questions everyone is asking: Will the Fed signal a pause, a pivot, or further hikes? What will the updated ‘dot plot’ reveal about the future path of rates? This uncertainty has a direct, stifling effect on currency volatility. Reduced Liquidity: Major players are reducing position sizes, leading to thinner trading conditions and exaggerated moves on any unexpected news. Dollar Dominance: The U.S. dollar’s strength often acts as a barometer for global risk sentiment. A hawkish Fed typically boosts the USD, putting pressure on emerging market and Asian currencies. Carry Trade Caution: Popular strategies that involve borrowing in low-yield currencies to invest in higher-yielding ones are being reassessed, impacting flows into Asian assets. The Australian Dollar Defies the Trend: Breaking Down the RBA Hold While most of Asia waited, the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) made its move. The decision to hold the cash rate steady at 4.35% was widely expected, but the accompanying statement and press conference delivered a hawkish undertone that fueled the Aussie dollar’s rally. RBA Key Signal Market Interpretation Impact on AUD/USD Commitment to return inflation to target No premature pivot; rates may stay higher for longer. Bullish Not ruling out further rate increases Door remains open for more tightening if needed. Bullish Acknowledgment of easing demand Policy is working, but the job isn’t finished. Neutral to Slightly Bullish The RBA’s stance contrasted with more dovish expectations that had been building. This surprise element provided the perfect catalyst for a short squeeze, pushing the AUD/USD pair firmly higher. The move highlights how central bank communication can be just as powerful as the policy decision itself in the forex market . How Are Other Major Asia FX Pairs Performing? The reaction across the region was one of general steadiness, but with underlying tensions. The Japanese Yen (JPY) remained under pressure, hovering near key levels that have prompted intervention warnings from Japanese officials in the past. The Chinese Yuan (CNY) was managed within a tight band by the People’s Bank of China (PBoC), reflecting a desire for stability ahead of the Fed. Southeast Asian currencies like the Thai Baht (THB) and Indonesian Rupiah (IDR) saw minimal movement, caught between local economic data and the overwhelming influence of the impending U.S. news. This creates a critical juncture for traders. The current Asia FX stability is fragile and likely a prelude to more significant volatility post-Fed. The direction of the next major move for these currencies will be largely dictated by the tone from Chair Jerome Powell and the FOMC. Actionable Insights for Navigating This Forex Market Environment In periods of high event risk, strategy is paramount. Here are key considerations: Manage Your Risk: Reduce leverage and position sizes ahead of the Fed announcement. Volatility can trigger rapid, gap moves that can quickly hit stop-loss orders. Watch the Reaction, Not Just the Action: The initial market move post-Fed can be deceptive. Focus on where currencies settle after the first hour of volatility—this often provides a truer direction. Correlation Awareness: Remember that a strong U.S. dollar reaction will have a ripple effect. If the USD surges, it’s likely to weigh on all Asia FX pairs, though commodity-linked currencies like the Australian dollar may show relative resilience. Conclusion: A Moment of Calm Before the Storm The apparent steadiness in Asia FX is a classic example of markets pausing to digest a potential seismic shift. The Fed decision is the week’s definitive event, capable of setting the tone for global currency markets for weeks to come. The standout performance of the Australian dollar following the RBA hold serves as a powerful reminder that local central bank narratives can create profitable divergence even during globally dominant themes. The forex market is now on high alert, with the calm of today poised to give way to the turbulence of tomorrow.

Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) What did the RBA decide at its latest meeting? The Reserve Bank of Australia ( RBA ) decided to hold its official cash rate steady at 4.35%. The accompanying statement was viewed as hawkish, signaling that the fight against inflation is not over. Who is the Chair of the U.S. Federal Reserve? The Chair of the Federal Reserve is Jerome Powell . His post-meeting press conference is closely watched by forex market participants for clues on future policy. Why is the Fed decision so important for Asian currencies? U.S. interest rate decisions directly influence the value of the U.S. dollar (USD). Since many Asian currencies trade heavily against the USD and global capital flows are sensitive to U.S. rates, the Fed’s actions have an outsized impact on Asia FX stability and direction. What is the ‘dot plot’ from the Fed? The ‘dot plot’ is a chart released by the Federal Reserve that summarizes the individual interest rate projections of FOMC members. It provides insight into where officials think rates are headed in the coming years, influencing long-term forex market expectations. Did other central banks in Asia meet this week? While the RBA was a key focus, other major Asian central banks like the Bank of Japan ( BOJ ) and the People’s Bank of China ( PBoC ) did not have scheduled policy meetings this week. Their actions are nonetheless constantly monitored by currency traders.

At the same time, Saylor’s company Strategy continued to expand its Bitcoin treasury after buying another $962.7 million worth of BTC even as its stock price fell more than 50% on the year. Despite market skepticism and concerns over liquidity risks in Bitcoin-based financial instruments, Strategy still maintains that its balance sheet is secure after raising $1.44 billion to reassure investors. Bitcoin Banking Could Attract Massive Capital Michael Saylor, CEO of the world’s largest Bitcoin-holding corporation, is urging nation-states to rethink their financial systems by building Bitcoin-backed digital banking products capable of drawing trillions in global capital. At the Bitcoin MENA conference in Abu Dhabi, Saylor argued that countries are missing a historic opportunity to offer high-yield, low-volatility digital accounts by leveraging overcollateralized Bitcoin reserves and tokenized credit instruments. These products, he said, could dramatically outperform the near-zero yields offered by traditional bank deposits in regions like Japan, Switzerland, and much of Europe. Even euro money-market funds deliver only around 150 basis points, while US money-market products hover near 400 basis points. Saylor believes that this yield stagnation forces investors into corporate bonds “that wouldn’t exist if people weren’t so disgusted with their bank account.” He described a digital banking structure in which roughly 80% of a fund consists of digital credit instruments, supported by 20% fiat currency and an additional 10% buffer to smooth volatility. With Bitcoin reserves overcollateralized at a 5:1 ratio and held by a treasury entity, such products could theoretically offer attractive returns while staying stable enough to operate in regulated banking systems. Saylor claimed that any country adopting this model could attract between $20 trillion and $50 trillion in deposits, and could turn into “the digital banking capital of the world.” His proposed banking model is similar to the structure of Strategy’s own STRC instrument, which was introduced in July as a money-market-style preferred share with a variable dividend around 10% and a design intended to keep its price near par. STRC has grown to roughly $2.9 billion in market cap, but critics are still wary of Bitcoin’s inherent volatility. BTC’s price action over the past year (Source: CoinMarketCap ) At around $90,010, Bitcoin is trading almost 30% below its October all-time high, and despite long-term gains of more than 1,100% over five years, its short-term swings still fuel skepticism. Former Salomon Brothers trader Josh Man argued that Bitcoin-backed high-yield products could face severe liquidity stress, and warned that raising rates to defend a peg may fail “when depositors want to get their money back out.” Strategy Keeps Buying Bitcoin Meanwhile, Michael Saylor’s Strategy expanded its already massive Bitcoin treasury by accumulating close to $1 billion worth of BTC even as inflows into digital asset treasuries slow and the company’s own stock faces steep declines. Saylor announced that Strategy bought 10,624 BTC for roughly $962.7 million at an average price of $90,615 per coin, bringing the firm’s total holdings to 660,624 BTC. Despite the downturn in Strategy’s share price, which fell 51% over the past year, the company is still in a strong unrealized profit position. Data from BitcoinTreasuries.NET estimates the value of Strategy’s holdings close to $60 billion, placing the firm more than 22% above its aggregate cost basis. Saylor continues to pitch Bitcoin as a transformative form of “digital capital,” a message he has been placing a lot of emphasis on during meetings with sovereign wealth funds, banks, family offices, and large-scale investors. He argues that Bitcoin now functions as digital gold and that a new category of “digital credit” can draw yield from this capital while reducing volatility. Despite concerns around the company’s ability to maintain obligations during major equity declines, Strategy repeatedly signaled confidence in its financial strength. CEO Phong Le recently pointed out that the firm raised $1.44 billion to counter market fear and ensure it could service debts and dividend commitments, pushing back against what he described as circulating FUD that encouraged short positions against Bitcoin.

Notably, this startup develops industrial robots utilizing research from the Italian Institute of Technology. This funding round was led by CDP Venture Capital, a company supported by the Italian government and operating through its Artificial Intelligence Fund. This information was made public following the release of Generative Bionics’s statement, shared by a reliable source. Some of the firms that participated in this round, apart from Tether, included AMD Ventures , the investment arm of the American chipmaker Advanced Micro Devices, and other industry investors. Tether aims to solidify its position as a leader with major investments in AI Tether’s investment marks another significant milestone in the company’s ongoing series of deals. Concerning its role in issuing the USDT stablecoin, sources acknowledged that stablecoins, cryptocurrencies that are typically connected to traditional currencies such as the dollar, have recently gained popularity, preferred by many as a suitable alternative method of payment. These sources also elaborated that this type of cryptocurrency usually relies on cash reserves and US government bonds issued on a short-term basis to maintain its value. Following this finding, Tether shared its forecast that the reserves supporting USDT will help it in attaining its target of generating approximately $15 billion in profit this year. The company made this prediction after noting high interest rates in the sector. Based in El Salvador , Tether has been utilizing these profits to expand its presence in various fields, including commodities, artificial intelligence, and sports. The firm also disclosed its growing interest in fields of AI and data. According to the Chief Executive Officer (CEO) of Tether, Paolo Ardoino, the Fintech company seeks to establish an internet where individuals possess authority over their own details. Meanwhile, apart from Generative Bionics, reports highlighted that the stablecoin issuer also backs Blackrock Neurotech, a pioneering medical device company that develops brain-computer interface (BCI) technology. Regarding Tether’s $81.6 million investment in Generative Bionics, sources familiar with the situation who wished to remain anonymous implied that under this deal, the Italian Humanoid-Robotics firm will hire engineers from the Italian Institute of Technology as it prepares for industrial use. The company will also utilize the funding to accelerate the development of its products and train its physical AI systems. This system is crucial as it integrates robotics with AI. In return, Generative Bionics’s robots effectively utilize tactile sensing, learning architectures, and human-robot interaction technologies in manufacturing, logistics, and other work settings. As competition in the AI ecosystem intensifies and demand for AI technology increases, the Italian Humanoid-Robotics firm has announced that it will showcase its first fully functioning humanoid robot at CES in Las Vegas this January. Tether explores commodities lending practices Last month, Tether announced its intention to increase its lending to commodities traders significantly . Ardoino claimed that th ey adopted the plan after these traders offered around $1.5 billion in credit to this market. During an interview, Tether’s CEO stated that the stablecoin issuer aims to enhance financing for trading in various commodities, including oil, cotton, wheat, and other agricultural goods, through this strategy. On the other hand, reports revealed that t he fintech company has also issued loans to its clients in both US dollars and its USDT stablecoin, which is pegged to the dollar. However, even with this move, Tether is still considered a smaller player compared to the leading banks participating in commodities lending. Nonetheless, sources mentioned that the firm has strong earnings potential resulting from its almost $200 billion in reserves. This, therefore, grants Tether the chance to compete effectively. “By using USDT for loans, Tether can also tap into a digital currency that is gaining popularity in commodity-exporting areas such as Latin America,” Ardoino said.

In a significant move for decentralized finance (DeFi) accessibility, the cross-chain protocol Across has announced its direct integration into the MetaMask wallet. This Across Protocol MetaMask integration empowers millions of users to swap and bridge assets across major networks directly from their trusted wallet interface, promising faster transactions and lower costs. What Does the Across Protocol and MetaMask Integration Actually Do? This partnership embeds Across’s routing technology directly into MetaMask’s built-in Swap and Bridge features. When you initiate a transfer, MetaMask’s system now automatically considers Across as one of the optimal paths. The integration supports moving assets between key networks like Ethereum, Solana, BNB Chain, Base, and Optimism. Therefore, you no longer need to visit a separate bridge website; the functionality lives right inside your wallet. Why is This a Game-Changer for DeFi Users? The primary benefits are speed, cost, and convenience. Cross-chain transactions have historically been slow and expensive. By leveraging Across’s optimistic verification model, this integration aims to slash both time and fees. Lower Costs: Across often provides more competitive rates by optimizing for capital efficiency. Faster Speeds: Some transfers can be completed in minutes instead of hours. Simplified Experience: Users stay within the familiar MetaMask environment, reducing steps and potential errors. This Across Protocol MetaMask integration effectively turns MetaMask into a more powerful hub for multi-chain activity. How Does This Strengthen Across’s Position in the Bridge Wars? The bridge market is fiercely competitive. Gaining direct access to MetaMask’s vast user base is a strategic masterstroke for Across. It provides unparalleled visibility and ease of adoption. The team stated this move will “expand user accessibility and strengthen competitiveness.” By being a default routing option, Across is positioned directly in front of users at their point of need, challenging other bridge providers. What Should Users Keep in Mind? While exciting, always practice caution in DeFi. Start with a small test transaction to verify the network, destination address, and fees. Double-check that you are using the official MetaMask extension or app to avoid phishing sites. Remember, the Across Protocol MetaMask integration is about routing; you are still interacting with smart contracts, so understand the inherent risks. Conclusion: A Step Toward a Unified Multi-Chain Future The collaboration between Across and MetaMask marks a pivotal step in smoothing out the fragmented blockchain landscape. It brings robust cross-chain functionality to the doorstep of everyday users, making DeFi more intuitive and accessible. As these integrations become more seamless, the vision of a truly interconnected crypto ecosystem comes closer to reality. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q: How do I access the Across bridge through MetaMask? A: Open your MetaMask wallet, click the “Swap” or “Bridge” button. When you select tokens on different networks, MetaMask’s routing will automatically include Across as an option if it’s the best path. Q: Which blockchains are supported by this integration? A: Major networks including Ethereum (ETH), Solana (SOL), BNB Chain (BNB), Base, and Optimism (OP) are supported, with more likely to be added over time. Q: Are the fees lower using Across via MetaMask? A> Yes, a core benefit of the Across Protocol MetaMask integration is the potential for lower transaction costs compared to some other bridge providers, thanks to its efficient design. Q: Is this integration safe to use? A> The integration uses the official, audited protocols of both Across and MetaMask. However, as with any DeFi transaction, users should always verify they are on the correct site and understand the transaction details before confirming. Q: Will this integration affect the price of the ACX token? A> While increased usage of the Across protocol could positively influence the ACX token ecosystem, this article does not provide financial advice. Token prices depend on numerous market factors.

A new rival, Remittix (RTX) , is stepping into the same $700 billion remittance battlefield with a very different approach, and analysts are beginning to treat it as one of the best crypto 2025 contenders. Many now argue that if you are looking past short-term XRP swings and scanning for the best new altcoin or next 100x crypto, you cannot ignore this fast-growing DeFi project. XRP Price Prediction: Can Ripple Still Lead The Remittance Race? XRP sits near the $2 region after several days of heavy selling pressure, even while its ETFs keep attracting capital. The token has tried to bounce from the $2 support many times, but every rebound looks a little weaker, which keeps traders cautious. A clean break below $2 would pull the price back toward earlier base zones, while a strong daily close above $2.22 to $2.25 could open a path toward the $2.7 zone. Source: TradingView On the bullish side, some analysts say the current XRP price prediction still supports a possible reversal. They point to a potential double bottom pattern near $1.8 and note that ETF inflows remain positive. If buyers manage to push XRP above $2.22, the next price range sits around $2.7. Nevertheless, the majority of the optimistic argument hinges on regulatory statements, bank relationships, and the overall broadening of the investment risk, making investors question whether XRP really is the best crypto to invest in at the moment or merely one of several of the best altcoins to monitor. Why Remittix Stands Out In The $700 Billion Remittance Battlefield While XRP tries to plug into banks and institutions, RTX is building a direct crypto-to-fiat rail that lets everyday users send and receive money through a simple wallet and web app. On the numbers side, Remittix has already raised over $28.5 million by selling around 693 million RTX tokens at $0.119 each. The team has confirmed its first centralized exchange listings with BitMart and LBank and has teased another major CEX reveal in December. The Remittix Wallet is live, it is listed on the Apple Store , and the team is preparing its crypto-to-fiat Web App, which is close to completion. At the same time, RTX passed a full security audit by CertiK and achieved a Skynet score of 80.09, grade A, ranking it number one among pre-launch tokens and earning more than 24,000 community ratings. Analysts who compare XRP price prediction models with RTX growth often come back to fundamentals. Instead of meme cycles, Remittix leans on clear data points that fit what serious investors look for when they scan the market for the best new altcoin: Remittix focuses on real cross-border payments, targeting a $700 billion remittance sector instead of pure speculation. The token sits under $1 at $0.119, which gives room for upside and keeps RTX on many “top crypto under $1” watchlists. The project has working products today, including a live wallet on the Apple Store and a Web App payments beta on the way. Security and trust are central, with a full CertiK audit, an A-grade Skynet score, and a number one ranking among pre-launch tokens. Growth is backed by clear CEX plans, with BitMart and LBank confirmed, plus a larger listing reveal scheduled, rather than vague promises. Final Thoughts In summary, XRP still matters in any serious XRP price prediction debate. It has ETFs, liquidity, and a long track record, and a recovery toward higher bands remains possible if support holds and inflows continue. However, when analysts list the top altcoins to watch in 2026, many now place Remittix beside or even ahead of XRP in the remittance race. The combination of sub-1 dollar pricing, live wallet, upcoming payment Web App, strong security scores, and confirmed exchange listings makes RTX stand out as one of the best crypto 2025 narratives for real-world use. FAQs Can XRP reach $2.75? Many analysts believe that XRP’s price can skyrocket as long as it stays above $2 and passes $2.25. Reaching $2.7 is possible if whale accumulation continues and exchange balances keep falling, but it would need strong ETF demand and another major wave of institutional buying. What affects the price of XRP? XRP moves mainly on whale activity, supply changes on exchanges, and how much interest comes from traders and institutions during bigger market swings. If all of these are positive, XRP’s price reacts and increases. However, if they aren’t, the price could drop to even lower levels. What catalysts could push Remittix higher? Remittix has a solid roadmap that many experts believe could lead it to be the project leading the next rally. The App Store wallet rollout, the upcoming web app launch, the next major CEX listing in December, and the fact that the project is already backed by thousands of users all give Remittix strong momentum for a bigger move. Is it a good time to buy XRP? Before investing, it is important that you do enough research. The next price is dependent on whether XRP will remain above $2.22 because many analysts think that this is a strengthening coin. In case it does, XRP may go beyond $2.50 and beyond. Nevertheless, investors must conduct their research to make investments. What sectors are leading now? Different parts of the crypto market have their own benefits, but payments, DeFi platforms, and cross-chain networks are attracting the most interest, which is why both XRP and Remittix are getting attention from traders looking for real utility.

Key Takeaways: ADGM now recognizes USDT across multiple major blockchains for regulated use. Tether says the move highlights stablecoins’ growing role in modern finance. The update comes as Binance also secures full ADGM authorization, boosting Abu Dhabi’s crypto ambitions. In a statement on Monday , Tether said ADGM now permits licensed institutions in the financial free zone to conduct regulated activities involving USDT across Aptos, Celo, Cosmos, Kaia, Near, Polkadot, Tezos, TON and TRON. These approvals expand on earlier recognition for USDT on Ethereum, Solana and Avalanche, broadening the stablecoin’s jurisdictional and technical reach across the region. ADGM Move Validates Stablecoins’ Financial Importance Paolo Ardoino, Tether’s CEO, said the move underscores the role of stablecoins in the modern financial system. “Introducing USDT within ADGM’s regulated digital asset framework reinforces the role of stablecoins as essential components of today’s financial landscape,” he said, adding that extending recognition across multiple chains helps strengthen Abu Dhabi’s standing as a hub for compliant digital finance. ADGM operates as a special economic zone and international financial center with its own legal, regulatory and judicial system. Its Financial Services Regulatory Authority (FSRA) oversees licensing and supervision for firms active within the jurisdiction. Under the newly issued recognition, ADGM-licensed entities can support USDT across nearly all major chains where the token circulates, creating a broader multichain foundation for settlement, trading and decentralized-application activity. Tether’s USD₮ Recognised as Accepted Fiat-Referenced Token in Abu Dhabi’s ADGM for Use on Several Major Blockchains Learn more: https://t.co/PKmF7w5aUx — Tether (@Tether_to) December 8, 2025 The announcement arrives as Abu Dhabi intensifies its campaign to attract global digital-asset firms. On the same day, Binance disclosed that it has secured full authorization to operate its flagship Binance.com platform under ADGM oversight, a milestone that comes after years of regulatory scrutiny. Binance will operate through three distinct legal entities in the zone, an exchange, a clearing house and a broker-dealer, reflecting a traditional financial-market structure designed to enable regulated trading, custody, settlement and off-exchange services. Co-CEO Richard Teng said the approval demonstrates Binance’s adherence to what he described as ADGM’s “gold-standard” regulatory expectations. Pending final operational steps, Binance.com is slated to begin regulated activity under the ADGM regime on Jan. 5, 2026, reinforcing the UAE capital’s strategy of pairing stringent oversight with an open stance toward digital-asset innovation. Tether Pushes Back as Arthur Hayes Flags Insolvency Risks As reported, Tether has faced renewed scrutiny after BitMEX founder Arthur Hayes warned that a 30% decline in the company’s Bitcoin and gold holdings could erase its equity. However, CoinShares’ James Butterfill rejected the alarm , noting that Tether holds more than $181 billion in reserves against $174.45 billion in liabilities, leaving a surplus of roughly $6.78 billion. His comments arrive amid broader market unrest tied to volatility in Japanese bonds and weak US labor data. CEO Paolo Ardoino also directly challenged Hayes’s claims, revealing that Tether Group’s total assets are closer to $215 billion, supported by around $7 billion in excess equity and an additional $23 billion in retained earnings. He emphasized that Bitcoin and gold make up only 12.6% of reserves, with more than 70% held in short-term US Treasuries. Ardoino accused critics of misreading the company’s attestation data, pointing to Tether’s roughly $500 million per month in interest income.

The regulator has officially stated that derivatives based on overseas cryptocurrency exchange-traded funds (ETFs) are not appropriate for the domestic market. This decision, rooted in a profound concern for investor safety, immediately reshapes the landscape for crypto investment products in one of the world’s most significant financial jurisdictions. For investors and firms eyeing the potential of crypto ETFs , this development demands close attention. What Did Japan’s FSA Actually Say About Crypto ETFs? The FSA clarified its position through a revised Q&A document on financial instruments. The core of their argument is straightforward: offering derivatives linked to overseas crypto ETFs to Japanese investors is unsuitable. Why? The agency points to a fundamental lack. There is no well-established system or regulatory environment in place to protect investors who engage with these complex products. Essentially, the FSA sees these instruments as sailing into uncharted and potentially dangerous waters without a proper safety net. The reaction from the market was swift and telling. IG Securities, a major brokerage, responded by suspending its offerings of Contracts for Difference (CFDs) based on U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs. This action is a direct consequence of the FSA’s guidance and serves as a clear signal to the entire industry. The message is unambiguous: Japan is drawing a firm line, and compliance is not optional. Why Is Japan Taking This Hard Stance on Derivatives? Japan has a long history of proactive and often conservative financial regulation, especially following past market scandals. The FSA’s primary mandate is to ensure market stability and protect consumers. When it comes to volatile assets like cryptocurrencies, layered with the complexity of derivatives, their caution intensifies. Let’s break down the key concerns driving this decision: Regulatory Gaps: Overseas crypto ETFs operate under foreign rules, which may not align with Japan’s stringent investor protection standards. Product Complexity: Derivatives like CFDs are inherently risky. Combining them with the volatility of crypto amplifies that risk exponentially. Market Integrity: The FSA likely worries about price discovery, transparency, and the potential for market manipulation in these cross-border products. Therefore, this isn’t just about saying ‘no’ to innovation. It’s a calculated move to prevent retail investors from exposure to what the regulator perceives as an unacceptable level of risk before proper safeguards are built. What Does This Mean for the Future of Crypto ETFs in Japan? The immediate implication is clear: Japan is unlikely to approve any crypto derivatives linked to overseas ETFs in the near future. This creates a significant barrier for global financial firms hoping to offer such products to Japanese clients. However, it’s crucial to view this within a broader context. This action does not necessarily mean Japan is closing the door on all crypto ETFs . The focus here is specifically on derivatives based on overseas funds. The development could potentially accelerate discussions around creating a domestic, fully-regulated framework for spot crypto ETFs. The FSA’s move underscores its preference for a controlled, home-grown ecosystem over reliance on external, less-supervised products. Key Takeaways for Investors and the Crypto Market Japan’s decision is a powerful reminder that the global path to crypto integration is not uniform. Regulatory approaches vary dramatically by region. For investors, this highlights the paramount importance of understanding the regulatory environment of any product they consider. For Japanese Investors: Access to leveraged or derivative products based on popular U.S. crypto ETFs will be severely restricted. Focus may shift to direct asset ownership or future domestic products. For the Global Industry: This sets a precedent. Other regulators with similar protective stances may follow Japan’s lead, creating a more fragmented global market for crypto-linked derivatives. The Big Picture: Regulation is advancing, but cautiously. Each step, even restrictive ones like this, is part of defining the long-term rules of the game for digital assets. In conclusion, Japan’s FSA has made a decisive and protective move. By deeming derivatives on overseas crypto ETFs inappropriate, it prioritizes systemic safety and investor security over rapid market expansion. This action forces a pause, compelling the industry to consider how to build more secure and transparent bridges between traditional finance and the crypto world. The journey continues, but the map is being redrawn with caution as a guiding principle. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What exactly did Japan’s FSA rule on? A1: Japan’s FSA stated that offering derivatives (like CFDs) based on cryptocurrency ETFs listed overseas is inappropriate for domestic investors due to insufficient investor protection frameworks. Q2: Does this ban all cryptocurrency ETFs in Japan? A2: No. The ruling specifically targets derivative products linked to overseas crypto ETFs. It does not directly ban spot crypto ETFs, especially potential future ones developed under Japanese regulation. Q3: What was the immediate market reaction? A3: IG Securities promptly suspended its CFD offerings tied to U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs, demonstrating immediate compliance with the FSA’s guidance. Q4: Why is Japan being so cautious? A4: Japan has a strong history of strict financial regulation aimed at consumer protection. The FSA is concerned about the high risk and lack of oversight for complex derivatives tied to volatile crypto assets from foreign jurisdictions. Q5: Can Japanese investors still buy U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs directly? A5: The FSA’s statement focuses on derivatives. The ability for Japanese residents to directly purchase shares of a U.S.-listed spot Bitcoin ETF would depend on their broker’s policies and other existing securities regulations, not this specific ruling. Q6: Will other countries follow Japan’s lead? A6: It’s possible. Regulators in other regions with similar conservative approaches to investor protection may see Japan’s move as a precedent, potentially leading to a more fragmented global regulatory landscape for crypto investment products.

The change would allow banks to handle trading and custody of a limited set of digital assets under tighter rules and monitoring. Banks Could Reopen Crypto Desks Under New Rules Reports have disclosed that the Banco Central de la República Argentina (BCRA) is reviewing a regulatory framework that would permit banks to provide crypto trading and custody, but only within a controlled, licensed setup. The move responds to heavy use of Bitcoin and stablecoins by many Argentines as a shield against peso weakness and inflation. Analysts say banks would likely need separate units, stronger custody systems and clear compliance checks before they can serve customers.

BREAKING: Argentina’s central bank is drafting rules to let banks offer crypto trading and custody, putting them in direct competition with exchanges under tighter KYC rules. Huge move for Argentina pic.twitter.com/RMz2icnC81 — Conor Kenny (@conorfkenny) December 8, 2025 That rule effectively prevented lenders from listing crypto products inside their apps or taking custody on behalf of clients. The ban pushed most retail activity toward registered Virtual Asset Service Providers (VASPs) and overseas platforms. What The New System Would Build On Based on reports, any shift would build on the country’s recent steps to regulate VASPs . The Comisión Nacional de Valores (CNV) has already issued registration criteria and AML/CFT requirements for local crypto firms, including technical rules on custody and “travel rule” compliance. Those existing rules are likely to form the baseline for the bank licensing regime, with extra safeguards for depositors and liquidity. How This Could Affect Users And The Market For everyday savers who turned to digital coins to protect savings, a bank-led service could mean easier access through familiar apps and possibly stronger institutional custody — though it would not erase price risk. Regulators are expected to insist on explicit risk disclosures and limits; client holdings in crypto would not automatically carry the same guarantees as insured bank deposits. Market players say initial offerings may focus on major assets such as Bitcoin and established stablecoins, rather than a wide array of tokens.

While institutional inflows into these products have accelerated, the number of active BTC addresses has declined. As Wall Street embraces BTC exposure, the network’s grassroots participation appears to be undergoing a significant transformation. In an X post, the CEO of SwanDesk, financial analyst Jacob King, pointed out that Bitcoin active addresses have been in a steady decline since the US spot BTC ETFs launched in January 2024, and the irony is obvious. Why Retail Participation Shows Signs Of Fatigue For years, BTC maximalists have pushed for Wall Street adoption, believing institutional involvement would unlock the next wave of mass usage. Instead, on-chain participation has dropped sharply as retail lost interest. Related Reading: US Fed Has Ended Quantitative Tightening, But Why Is The Bitcoin Price Still Below $100,000? King noted that these Bitcoiners have piled into the ETF for a quick, early FOMO bump, and then bailed, leaving behind a market where the asset is increasingly traded by proxy. According to King, ETF investing kills BTC’s core principles. While investors no longer hold or control their own assets as banks do, which is the very system BTC was designed to challenge, greed always beats ideology. Market watcher Crypto Seth has revealed that the net inflows into BlackRock and Fidelity’s spot BTC ETFs have been relatively subdued since October 10, when the largest liquidation events happened. Seth believes that this might turn into a momentum reversal soon, as the US stock market is at 1% below new highs despite retail sentiment remaining stuck in extreme fear. Seth also pointed out that the macro backdrop is shifting in BTC’s favor. This is because the Federal Reserve ended its Quantitative Tightening (QT) program on December 1, 2025, wrapping up a multi-year effort that shaved nearly $3 trillion from the balance sheet since 2022. Since the US Fed rate is still at 4.00%, more interest rate cuts are on the horizon, which is higher than both Europe and China. The BlackRock iShares BTC Trust (IBIT), which was launched in January 2024, is currently the firm’s most profitable exchange-traded fund (ETF) based on annual fee revenue, despite being less than two years old. Unlocking Bitcoin Without Compromising Its Core Principles Bitcoin is seeing key initiatives that improve its ecosystem. Every market cycle that has promise to unlock Bitcoin for decentralized finance (DeFi), RioSwap is one of the few products built on infrastructure that was capable of unlocking it in a truly decentralized way. Related Reading: Bitcoin Aims Higher as Bulls Regain Strength and Push for Resistance Break According to Mintlayer, this was powered by Mintlayer’s native HTLC architecture, as RioSwap introduces a Decentralized Exchange (DEX) that allows BTC to move directly into decentralized markets without wrapping, unbridging, and is fully in the user’s control. With the RioSwap testnet now live, Mintlayer sees this as the start of a new liquidity phase for BTC where the asset will become an active participant in the decentralized market on its own terms.

Over the past year, a net total of 403,200 BTC has moved off centralized trading platforms, representing a 2.1% reduction in the entire supply held on exchanges, according to the report. In general, this is a positive long-term sign, according to Santiment. “The less coins that exist on exchanges, the less likely we’ve historically seen a major sell-off that causes downside pressure for an asset’s price.” Exchange Outflows Are Bullish Investors usually take coins off exchanges to hodl or custody, which is bullish. They send them to exchanges in preparation for selling, which is bearish. Around 14.7% of the total Bitcoin supply is currently held on exchanges, according to Glassnode. This has been in decline since mid-2022, when almost 18% was held on exchanges. As Bitcoin’s market value hovers around $90K, crypto’s top market cap continues to see its supply moving away from exchanges.

Back to Bitcoin, analysts believe that the bottom is strengthening, which could lead to a rebound. The OBV (On-Balance Volume) chart is a lot cleaner than the price, said analyst Sykodelic on Tuesday. “It is both holding and moving stronger than the price … which shows us the buying is far stronger than the selling.” Meanwhile, fellow analyst “Daan” said Bitcoin was “stalling while its bull market support band is closing in.” Analyst “Colin” was also bearish, identifying a bear flag continuation pattern, “which means a move down would be the expected outcome.” If such a move down did occur, $74,000 to $77,000 would be the likeliest bottom, he said. Short-term Pain Remains It appears that Colin may have been onto something, as Bitcoin had lost the $90,000 level again at the time of writing. The asset had lost 1.4% on the day and was trading at $89,862, but remained within its weekly range-bound channel. Bitcoin has struggled to break through resistance at $92,000. It appears that this week’s Federal Reserve rate cut is already priced in , so it is unlikely to get a boost from that, and down appears to be the path of least resistance.

Here’s the Latest,https://timestabloid.com/xrp-just-made-history-in-the-united-states-heres-the-latest/,"Crypto analyst BullRunners highlighted what he described as a historic moment for XRP, pointing to Bitnomial’s regulatory filings and approvals that establish the foundation for a fully supervised U.S. trading environment. The documents he shared include the Commodity Futures Trading Commission’s Order of Registration for Bitnomial Clearinghouse LLC as a derivatives clearing organization and the exchange’s formal self-certification to list an XRP-referenced U.S. dollar futures contract. Together, they show the steps taken to bring XRP into a regulated framework recognized under U.S. derivatives law. The Order of Registration confirms that Bitnomial met the compliance standards required for clearing operations. The self-certification, dated August 9, 2024, outlines the exchange’s intent to introduce a physically settled XRP futures contract, designated XUS, with an initial trade date no earlier than August 13, 2024. The filing also situates the contract within Bitnomial’s published rulebook and clearing procedures. $XRP MAKES HISTORY WITH THE FIRST U.S. REGULATED LISTING! #XRP #XRPCommunity pic.twitter.com/3g3qo3bjEf — BULLRUNNERS (@BullrunnersHQ) December 8, 2025 Advantages of the regulated structure The filings indicate that XRP will be supported inside a market that operates under full CFTC supervision. Bitnomial, as both a registered exchange and clearinghouse, is obligated to meet federal requirements for surveillance, reporting, operational integrity, and ongoing audits. This establishes a transparent and disciplined environment that aligns XRP with protections already applied to traditional U.S. derivatives products. For XRP, this marks a shift from fragmented or offshore venues into a domain that adheres to established federal standards. The proposed XRP/USD spot structure, functioning within this supervised framework, places the asset under the same regulatory expectations that govern other U.S. financial instruments. It provides a regulated foundation that strengthens market credibility and offers clearer safeguards for participants. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Institutional relevance and broader market impact One of the most significant implications of this development is the institutional access it enables. Many banks, hedge funds, and asset managers are restricted from interacting with unregulated platforms due to strict internal compliance rules. The presence of a regulated XRP market eliminates this constraint, allowing institutions to participate through an exchange that satisfies federal custody, transparency, and operational requirements. This creates a compliant pathway for larger capital pools seeking structured exposure to digital assets. A regulated spot environment also lays the groundwork for more advanced financial products. Instruments such as options, structured notes, and settlement tools rely on dependable pricing and secure market infrastructure. Bitnomial already incorporates XRP and RLUSD into its margin systems, indicating the technical readiness to support additional structures as the market evolves.

You’re not alone. A seismic shift is underway in the crypto landscape, as Bitcoin exchange reserves have experienced a dramatic year-over-year decline of over 400,000 BTC. This massive outflow from centralized platforms signals a profound change in investor behavior and market structure. Let’s unpack what this means for the future of Bitcoin’s price and the broader adoption narrative. What Does the Drop in Bitcoin Exchange Reserves Actually Mean? Data from analytics firm Santiment reveals a clear trend: investors are pulling their Bitcoin off exchanges. This movement of over 400,000 BTC—worth tens of billions of dollars—is more than just a statistic. It represents a fundamental shift from short-term trading to long-term holding. When Bitcoin sits on an exchange, it’s often seen as ‘for sale.’ Its removal suggests investors are opting for self-custody, viewing their BTC as a store of value to be secured privately, not a quick-trade asset. Santiment analysts note this decline can signal an easing of long-term selling pressure. Simply put, less Bitcoin readily available on exchanges means less potential supply to hit the market during sell-offs. This trend has persisted even as Bitcoin’s price trades robustly around the $90,000 level, indicating conviction beyond mere price speculation. Where is the Bitcoin Going? The Rise of ETFs and Institutional Holdings If Bitcoin is leaving exchanges, where is it heading? The answer highlights two powerful, parallel trends shaping the market. Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs): Data from sources like Bitbo shows U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs now hold a staggering 1.5 million BTC. These financial products allow traditional investors to gain exposure without directly managing keys, absorbing a huge portion of the available supply. Public Companies & Institutions: Major corporations and funds now hold over one million BTC in their treasuries. This institutional adoption treats Bitcoin as a strategic reserve asset, similar to gold. Combined, these two groups control approximately 11% of Bitcoin’s total 21 million supply. This institutional wall is a primary driver sucking liquidity from exchanges and into long-term cold storage. Why Are Investors Pulling Bitcoin Off Exchanges? The exodus from centralized platforms isn’t random. It’s driven by clear, rational motivations that every crypto holder should understand. Security & Self-Sovereignty: The mantra ‘not your keys, not your coins’ has never been more relevant. High-profile exchange failures have taught investors the risks of third-party custody. Long-Term ‘HODL’ Mentality: The market is maturing. Many buyers now intend to hold for years, not days. Moving coins to a private wallet is the logical step for this strategy. Anticipation of Future Scarcity: With the next Bitcoin halving reducing new supply and institutional demand rising, investors are positioning for potential future price appreciation by securing their coins now. What Are the Implications for Bitcoin’s Price and Market Health? This drain on Bitcoin exchange reserves creates a fundamentally different supply dynamic. A lower liquid supply on trading venues can lead to increased price volatility, but often to the upside. When demand meets limited available sell-side liquidity, prices can move sharply. This environment potentially reduces the severity of prolonged bear markets, as the ‘weak hands’ have already moved their coins off exchanges. However, it also presents a challenge for new entrants. As Bitcoin becomes harder to source from exchanges without moving the price, the role of ETFs as a liquidity conduit becomes even more critical for mainstream adoption. Actionable Insights for Crypto Investors What should you do in response to this market shift? Consider these points. Evaluate Your Custody Strategy: If you’re holding long-term, research secure self-custody solutions like hardware wallets. Understand Market Liquidity: Recognize that large buy or sell orders on exchanges may have a bigger price impact than before. Monitor the Data: Keep an eye on exchange reserve metrics as a key indicator of overall market sentiment and potential selling pressure. In conclusion, the staggering 400,000 BTC drop in Bitcoin exchange reserves is a powerful vote of confidence in Bitcoin’s long-term value. It marks the maturation of the market from a speculative trading arena to an ecosystem where institutional adoption and personal sovereignty are paramount. This supply squeeze, driven by ETFs and corporate treasuries, lays the groundwork for a new era of Bitcoin economics defined by scarcity and institutional validation. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q: Why is a drop in Bitcoin exchange reserves considered bullish? A: It’s considered bullish because it reduces the immediate selling pressure on the market. Bitcoin held in private wallets or institutional custody is less likely to be sold impulsively, creating a scarcer liquid supply for trading. Q: Does this mean I should immediately move all my Bitcoin off an exchange? A: It depends on your goals. If you are actively trading, you need some funds on an exchange. If you are a long-term holder, moving the majority to a secure private wallet is a prudent strategy for security and peace of mind. Q: How do Bitcoin ETFs affect exchange reserves? A: ETFs purchase massive amounts of Bitcoin, often directly from exchanges or OTC desks. This process permanently removes that Bitcoin from the exchange’s available supply, as the ETF custodian holds it in deep cold storage. Q: What is the risk of everyone moving Bitcoin off exchanges? A: The primary risk is reduced liquidity, which can lead to higher volatility and wider bid-ask spreads, making large trades more expensive to execute. It also centralizes trading activity among fewer participants. Q: Where can I track Bitcoin exchange reserve data? A: Several analytics platforms like Glassnode, CryptoQuant, and Santiment provide real-time and historical data on exchange balances, allowing you to monitor these trends yourself.

This strategic license from the Abu Dhabi Global Market’s regulatory authority marks a significant expansion for digital dollar services in a key financial region. Let’s explore what this means for the future of crypto payments. What Does Circle’s Abu Dhabi License Actually Mean? The Financial Services Regulatory Authority (FSRA) of the Abu Dhabi Global Market (ADGM) has granted Circle permission to operate as a licensed Money Services Business. This isn’t just a minor regulatory checkbox. It’s a formal endorsement that allows Circle to offer regulated, institutional-grade financial services from within the ADGM, a leading international financial free zone. Consequently, Circle can now legally provide services like wholesale payments, cross-border settlements, and custody related to USDC directly to businesses and financial institutions in the region. This move effectively bridges traditional Middle Eastern finance with the efficiency of blockchain-based digital dollars. Why is the Circle Abu Dhabi License a Major Deal? This development is more than corporate news. It represents a strategic pivot. The Middle East, particularly the UAE, has positioned itself as a progressive hub for digital assets. By obtaining this Circle Abu Dhabi license , the company gains a trusted foothold in a market eager for innovation. The benefits are substantial: Regulatory Clarity: Businesses in the region can now partner with a fully licensed entity, reducing compliance risk. Faster Settlements: Using USDC for B2B payments can slash transaction times from days to seconds. Market Access: It opens the door for regional institutions to integrate digital dollar transactions seamlessly. Therefore, this license acts as a key that unlocks institutional adoption, providing a compliant on-ramp for traditional capital into the digital asset ecosystem. How Will This Shape the Future of USDC and Crypto Payments? Circle’s immediate plan involves expanding its suite of services anchored around USDC. Think of large-scale, business-to-business (B2B) payments, treasury management, and cross-border trade settlements. The Circle Abu Dhabi license provides the legal framework to make these services a daily reality for corporations in the MENA region. Imagine a manufacturer in Dubai paying a supplier in Singapore instantly with USDC, avoiding traditional banking delays and fees. This license makes that scenario not just possible, but regulated and secure. It signals that major stablecoins are evolving from speculative trading instruments into core infrastructure for global commerce. What Are the Broader Implications for Crypto Regulation? Abu Dhabi’s ADGM is known for its robust yet forward-thinking regulatory framework. By granting this license, the FSRA is sending a clear message: it supports the responsible integration of blockchain technology into the mainstream financial system. This move could encourage other jurisdictions to develop clear licensing paths for credible crypto enterprises. However, the challenge remains for companies to meet the high compliance standards expected by such regulators. Circle’s success here sets a precedent, proving that major crypto players can operate within strict regulatory perimeters while driving innovation. Conclusion: A Strategic Step for Global Crypto Finance Circle securing its Abu Dhabi financial services license is a pivotal moment. It transcends a single company’s expansion and highlights a growing trend of strategic convergence between leading crypto firms and progressive financial hubs. This development strengthens USDC’s utility as a digital dollar for institutional use and accelerates the maturation of the entire cryptocurrency market in a key economic corridor. The bridge between traditional and digital finance just got a major new pillar. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What exactly is the license Circle received in Abu Dhabi? A1: Circle received a Financial Services Permission (FSP) from the ADGM’s Financial Services Regulatory Authority (FSRA). This licenses them as a Money Services Business, allowing them to offer regulated digital asset services. Q2: How does this benefit users or businesses? A2: Businesses in the region gain access to fast, low-cost, and regulated B2B payments and settlements using USDC, with the assurance of dealing with a fully licensed entity. Q3: Does this mean Circle can now issue USDC from Abu Dhabi? A3: The license primarily allows Circle to provide payment and settlement services using USDC. The stablecoin itself remains a digital dollar issued on multiple blockchains. Q4: Why did Circle choose Abu Dhabi for this expansion? A4: Abu Dhabi’s ADGM offers a clear, reputable regulatory framework for fintech and digital assets, making it an ideal strategic hub for expanding into the Middle East and surrounding markets. Q5: Will this affect the price or stability of USDC? A5: Not directly. The license pertains to service expansion, not the monetary policy of USDC, which remains 1:1 backed by cash and short-term U.S. Treasuries. Q6: Can individual investors in the UAE now use Circle’s services more easily? A6: The license focuses on institutional and business-to-business (B2B) services. Retail access may come later but is not the immediate goal of this regulatory milestone. Found this insight into Circle’s strategic move valuable?

Key Takeaways: Circle obtained an ADGM license to operate USDC services under full regulatory oversight. The approval strengthens Abu Dhabi’s push to become a global hub for regulated digital assets. Circle appointed Dr. Saeeda Jaffar to lead regional expansion and drive USDC adoption. The approval allows Circle to operate as a fully regulated Money Services Provider within the UAE’s capital market free zone, the company said in a Tuesday’s press release . Circle Gains Full Regulatory Entry Into UAE’s Fast-Growing Crypto Hub The license grants Circle the ability to offer regulated payment, settlement, and digital-asset services tied to USDC, giving the company a formal operating presence inside one of the world’s fastest-growing hubs for compliant crypto activity. The move comes as the UAE continues to position itself as a global center for digital-asset regulation, with ADGM leading efforts to attract firms seeking clear rules for fiat-referenced tokens and tokenized financial services. As part of its expansion, Circle appointed Dr. Saeeda Jaffar as Managing Director for the Middle East and Africa. Dr. Jaffar, currently a senior executive at Visa overseeing the GCC region, will join Circle to guide its strategy, build regional partnerships, and push for broader adoption of USDC in business payments and financial infrastructure across the UAE and beyond. Circle expands its regulatory footprint in the UAE Announced at Abu Dhabi Finance Week: → Secured an @ADGlobalMarket FSRA Financial Services Permission to operate as a Money Services Provider This milestone builds on USDC and EURC being the first stablecoins recognized by… pic.twitter.com/BCSDOpo3mb — Circle (@circle) December 9, 2025 “Regulatory clarity is the foundation of a more open and efficient internet financial system. We are honored to work with the FSRA in ADGM,” Circle co-founder and CEO Jeremy Allaire said. With the license in hand, Circle plans to expand regulated USDC use in corporate payments, settlement rails and developer infrastructure across the region. The announcement also follows Dubai’s earlier recognition of USDC and EURC under the DFSA’s crypto token regime, giving Circle regulatory footing across both of the UAE’s major financial zones. Stablecoins have also surged in mainstream adoption since President Donald Trump signed the GENIUS Act into law in July , establishing a federal framework for their issuance and oversight. The law’s passage triggered a wave of new stablecoin initiatives from major financial institutions, including Bank of America , Morgan Stanley, and Robinhood. Tether, Binance Secure Regulatory Approval in ADGM As reported, Tether’s USDT stablecoin has also secured regulatory recognition as an approved fiat-referenced token across a wide range of blockchains inside the ADGM. Tether said ADGM now permits licensed institutions in the financial free zone to conduct regulated activities involving USDT across Aptos, Celo, Cosmos, Kaia, Near, Polkadot, Tezos, TON and TRON. These approvals expand on earlier recognition for USDT on Ethereum, Solana and Avalanche. On Monday, Binance disclosed that it has also secured full authorization to operate its flagship Binance.com platform under ADGM oversight, a milestone that comes after years of regulatory scrutiny. Binance will operate through three distinct legal entities in the zone, an exchange, a clearing house and a broker-dealer, reflecting a traditional financial-market structure designed to enable regulated trading, custody, settlement and off-exchange services.

Predictions Point To A $150,000 Rally In 2026",https://www.newsbtc.com/bitcoin-news/did-2025-mark-a-bear-market-for-bitcoin-predictions-point-to-a-150000-rally-in-2026/,"As Bitcoin (BTC) experienced significant volatility throughout the year, reaching new all-time highs (ATHs) before enduring sharp corrections of up to 30%, the cryptocurrency community has become increasingly polarized regarding its future direction. Many analysts are raising concerns about a potential bear market emerging in 2026; however, market expert Shanaka Anslem has offered a different perspective on social media platform X (formerly Twitter), questioning whether 2025 has already represented the real bear market. A Sign Of Cycle Change In his analysis, Anslem highlights key evidence. For the first time in history, Bitcoin breached its all-time high prior to the Halving event in April of this year, which he argues isn’t a bullish signal but rather an indication of the cycle inverting. According to him, 2024 should not be viewed as the beginning of a new bull run; instead, it was a period of what he calls “political repricing” as the market factored in a pro-crypto administration with President Donald Trump’s reelection. Related Reading: Here’s How High The Dogecoin Price Will Go Once The MACD Bullish Cross Happens The characteristics of a bear market have been evident in 2025, according to Anslem. Bitcoin’s dominance has reached multi-year highs while altcoins continue to struggle, leading to quarter-after-quarter declines in their values. Additionally, a massive $3.5 billion in exchange-traded fund (ETF) outflows occurred within just one month. This year saw a significant 29% drawdown from its October highs, paired with extreme fear readings on various sentiment indices. Anslem insists that while the four-year Halving cycle remains relevant, its impact has evolved. With $120 billion in ETF interconnected with the Federal Reserve’s (Fed) liquidity, the Halving continues to dictate BTC’s supply, but demand now aligns with broader economic narratives rather than the more crypto-specific factors. Major Bitcoin Rally Ahead? What does Anslem’s “cycle inversion” theory implies for 2026? If the bear market has already transpired, masked by nominal highs, the next logical phase might be a genuine blow-off top. His predictions suggest Bitcoin’s price could soar to between $150,000 and $200,000, particularly as global liquidity continues to expand and directs capital toward hard assets. Anslem believes that many in the market are currently positioned for a downturn that has already occurred. However, dissenting opinions exist. Analyst Mr. Wall Street argues that the bottom for Bitcoin has not yet arrived and won’t be realized in the coming weeks or months. Related Reading: Here’s When The Altcoin Season Happens Following The Bitcoin Cycle He highlights that the critical support level has been breached, indicated by the weekly exponential moving-average (EMA50) closing below the threshold. He asserts that the market has entered the early stages of a substantial bear market, predicting that it will only abate once Bitcoin reaches the $54,000 to $60,000 range, which he expects might occur in the fourth quarter of 2026. Despite this bearish outlook, he remains cautiously optimistic about Bitcoin in the short term. He expects a potential upward movement to retest the EMA50 Weekly, which currently stands at approximately $100,000, while maintaining that mid-term targets are much lower. At the time of writing, BTC was trading at $90,352, which represents a 28% difference between current valuations and ATH levels.

Coinbase Has Returned To India For The First Time Since 2023 As reported by TechCrunch, Coinbase has resumed user onboarding in India for the first time since pulling out of the country back in 2023, more than two years ago. The American crypto exchange ranks as the largest public digital asset company in the world, hosting around $516 billion in assets on its platform. Initially, the exchange first entered India in 2022, but only a few days after beginning services, it had to suspend UPI payments. UPI, short for Unified Payments Interface, is the most widely adopted real-time digital payments instrument in India. The National Payments Corporation of India (NPCI) had said shortly after Coinbase’s launch that it wasn’t aware of any crypto exchange using UPI. With UPI access gone, Coinbase users no longer had a way to purchase digital assets on the platform using fiat. The exchange stopped new user signups in June 2023, with a complete discontinuation of services happening in September 2023. “We had millions of customers in India, historically, and we took a very clear stance to off-board those customers entirely from overseas entities, where they were domiciled and regulated,” said Coinbase’s APAC director, John O’Loghlen, at India Blockchain Week (IBW). O’Loghlen added that the decision to pull out didn’t come without hesitation. Fast-forward to 2025, and Coinbase announced in March that it had registered with India’s Financial Intelligence Unit (FIU), allowing it to provide crypto services in the country. The platform opened in early access in October, and now, it has seen a full public launch. So far, users can only access crypto-to-crypto trading, but according to O’Loghlen, a fiat on-ramp is planned to become available next year. This would allow users to buy digital assets using the Indian Rupee (INR). While India isn’t closed off to cryptocurrencies like its northern neighbor, China, it still has a relatively strict digital-asset regulation regime. The nation collects a 30% tax on investor crypto profits and allows for no offsets against losses. Additionally, it charges a 1% Tax Deducted at Source (TDS) on all transactions, as a method of tracking digital asset activity. Naturally, this taxation regime isn’t ideal for crypto companies, as it directly affects adoption. O’Loghlen said that Coinbase is hoping the Indian government will relax the tax to make it more convenient for investors to hold digital assets. Reopening its exchange isn’t the only move that Coinbase has made in the subcontinent recently. As announced on its blog, the platform has made an investment in Indian crypto exchange CoinDCX. “Taken together, these steps reflect a clear commitment: we believe India and its neighbors will help shape the future of the global onchain economy,” noted the post. Bitcoin Price At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading around $91,800, up more than 7% over the last week.",Coinbase|bitcoin|btc|BTCUSDT|coinbase|crypto|Crypto Exchange Coinbase|india|india crypto|India Crypto Tax,EN,0,0,BTC|EXCHANGE|REGULATION|TRADING|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-12-09 07:00:24

He described tokenization as a practical path for markets, stating that it allows a token on a blockchain to represent an underlying security. In a video shared by X Finance Bull (@Xfinancebull), Atkins noted that such a token “would be subject to SEC rules by law.” He also stated that on-chain systems can create greater transparency than current market rails. He highlighted the opacity that issuers face today when trying to determine the status of shares. Atkins highlighted the prospect of faster settlement. He pointed to the potential to move from multi-day to same-day transactions. He said on-chain Delivery versus Payment (DvP) could cut risk in clearance and settlement. He views tokenization as a way to modernize market operations . This opinion has drawn the attention of the XRP army. This will literally pump $XRP within two years They won’t run tokenized markets on hype chains They’ll use U.S.-built, enterprise-grade tech THAT'S $XRP LEDGER Compliant, proven, ready Trillions are coming on-chain $XRP to $100 and beyond! pic.twitter.com/zynDikTtjQ — X Finance Bull (@Xfinancebull) December 7, 2025 XRP’s Potential Role in this System X Finance Bull linked Atkins’s remarks to XRP. He stated that major institutions will not “run tokenized markets on hype chains.” He said they will choose enterprise systems, asserting that the XRP Ledger fits that profile. He described it as compliant and ready for large volumes, and projected trillions moving on-chain . He also predicted strong price action for XRP. He believes increased tokenization activity on the XRPL will pump XRP within two years. He added, “XRP to $100 and beyond!” The contrast matters. Atkins discussed tokenized securities and regulatory policy, focusing on transparency, faster settlement, and the need for the U.S. to embrace new technology. X Finance Bull framed those remarks through an XRP-centric lens, tying the interview to XRP’s rising prominence in the tokenization market . A Modern Regulatory Approach Atkins pointed to past friction between the SEC and innovators, stating that the agency had blocked market progress in recent years. Atkins noted that the U.S. was one of only two countries that attempted to illegalise cryptocurrencies. However, the SEC no longer takes that position . He framed the SEC as an institution that now supports modernization. This shift interests XRP holders because the asset was involved in the longest crypto-related legal battle with the SEC. Regulatory openness is important for XRP to play a role in institutional and global financial systems. With regulatory clarity, the asset can dominate the tokenization market, and Atkins’s remarks validate a future where regulated markets adopt the asset big time.

The exchange has officially updated the Orderly Network circulation plan following a direct request from the project’s development team. This move signals important changes in how these tokens enter the market, affecting everything from supply dynamics to long-term value. If you’re invested in ORDER or watching decentralized finance infrastructure projects, you need to understand what this revision means. What Does the Updated Orderly Network Circulation Plan Mean? The revised Orderly Network circulation plan represents more than just administrative paperwork. When a major exchange like Upbit adjusts token circulation details, it typically reflects deeper project developments. The Orderly Network team specifically requested this update, suggesting strategic shifts in their token distribution timeline or release schedule. Such changes can influence market perception, trading volume, and ultimately, token valuation across all supporting platforms. Understanding circulation plans is fundamental for smart crypto investing. These documents outline how and when tokens become available for trading. A sudden update might indicate: Accelerated or delayed token releases from team or investor allocations Revised vesting schedules for early contributors Adjusted unlock timelines that affect circulating supply Strategic partnerships requiring different distribution approaches Why Should Crypto Investors Care About Circulation Updates? Token circulation directly impacts scarcity and demand. A well-managed Orderly Network circulation plan helps prevent market flooding that could depress prices. Conversely, overly restrictive releases might limit liquidity and trading opportunities. Upbit’s announcement matters because this exchange serves as a primary gateway for Korean investors, who represent significant trading volume in Asian crypto markets. The timing of such updates often correlates with project milestones. Orderly Network, which provides decentralized trading infrastructure, might be aligning its token release with: New protocol upgrades or feature launches Exchange listing expansions beyond Upbit Strategic partnership announcements Ecosystem development fund distributions How Does This Affect Your ORDER Token Strategy? While Upbit hasn’t released specific percentage changes or new timelines, the mere fact of an updated Orderly Network circulation plan requires investor attention. First, monitor ORDER’s trading volume and price action on Upbit in coming days. Significant deviations from market trends might indicate how traders interpret these changes. Second, watch for official communications from the Orderly Network team explaining their request’s rationale. Practical steps for ORDER holders include: Reviewing updated documentation on both Upbit and Orderly Network’s official channels Comparing circulation plans with similar DeFi infrastructure projects Assessing supply inflation rates against project development milestones Monitoring large wallet movements that might signal early reactions The Bigger Picture: Transparency in Crypto Tokenomics Upbit’s proactive announcement demonstrates growing maturity in crypto exchange communications. Rather than silently implementing changes, they’re informing users about the revised Orderly Network circulation plan . This transparency builds trust with traders who need accurate information for decision-making. Moreover, it sets a positive precedent for how exchanges should handle project-requested modifications to listed assets. For the Orderly Network project itself, this update represents an opportunity to reinforce their commitment to sustainable tokenomics. Clear, communicated circulation plans help: Build investor confidence through predictability Align community expectations with project development Create defensibility against supply manipulation accusations Establish credibility with future exchange listing partners Ultimately, this circulation plan update serves as a reminder that successful crypto investing requires attention to fundamental details beyond price charts. Token distribution mechanics form the foundation of any project’s economic model, and changes to these plans warrant careful consideration alongside technical analysis and market sentiment. Frequently Asked Questions What exactly is a token circulation plan? A circulation plan outlines how a cryptocurrency’s total supply enters the market over time. It includes release schedules for team allocations, investor tokens, ecosystem funds, and other reserved amounts, directly impacting circulating supply and potential scarcity. Why would Orderly Network request a circulation plan update? Projects typically update circulation plans to align with changed development timelines, new partnership requirements, or revised tokenomic strategies. The goal is usually to optimize token distribution for long-term ecosystem health. How quickly do circulation plan changes affect token price? Market reaction varies. Sometimes prices move immediately on announcement speculation; other times effects manifest gradually as actual token releases occur according to the new schedule. Smart investors watch both the announcement and implementation phases. Where can I find the updated Orderly Network circulation details? Check Upbit’s official announcement page and Orderly Network’s documentation portal. Reputable crypto data aggregators like CoinMarketCap or CoinGecko typically update their supply metrics once official figures are published. Should I change my ORDER investment strategy because of this? Not necessarily immediately. First understand the specific changes, then assess how they align with your investment thesis. Consider whether the update makes the project’s tokenomics stronger or weaker relative to alternatives in the DeFi infrastructure space. Do other exchanges follow similar update procedures? Leading exchanges increasingly maintain transparent communication about listed asset changes. However, practices vary globally. Upbit’s approach reflects South Korea’s relatively strict regulatory environment requiring clearer investor communications. Found this analysis helpful?

The announcements were led by Yoyee Wang, Head of Business to Business of Bybit , who outlined Bybit’s integrated institutional blueprint — combining custody, credit, execution, governance, and operational resiliency into one cohesive platform. Reinventing Institutional Credit Yoyee highlighted that Bybit’s upgraded INS Credit Suite now delivers one of the most advanced and transparent credit environments available to institutional clients. “Across the industry, one theme is clear: institutions want capital efficiency without compromising control. With up to 5× leverage, TradFi-aligned LTV parameters, and support for 1,000 sub-accounts, we’re delivering a true institutional-grade credit architecture,” added Yoyee. The demand reinforces that shift. Bybit’s INS loan notional reached USD 1.1 billion this quarter, marking a 26% QoQ increase, driven by active adoption from professional trading firms. Custody + RWA + Credit: A New Operating Model for Institutions A headline announcement of Yoyee’s presentation was the integration of custody-based RWA tokens into Bybit’s off-exchange credit infrastructure — a first-of-its-kind development for digital asset markets. “For the first time, institutions can keep assets in custody, earn returns through tokenized money-market RWAs, and still unlock institutional credit. It combines control, transparency, and efficiency in a way the market has not seen before,” said Yoyee. This model connects regulated custody, yield, and capital deployment into a single operational workflow — eliminating fragmentation and unlocking new efficiencies for asset managers and trading firms. A Leap in Execution: Round-Trip Latency Cut from 30ms to 2.5ms The second major upgrade unveiled was Bybit’s next-generation Market Maker Gateway (MMGW) execution architecture, engineered specifically for institutional consistency and predictability. Yoyee announced that Bybit has brought round-trip latency for INS clients down to 5 milliseconds through its new MMGW architecture, with a next-generation 2.5-millisecond execution channel planned for release in 2026. “Speed alone isn’t the breakthrough — certainty is,” she said. “We engineered an execution lane designed for institutional performance: consistent, stable, and resistant to noise.” A Unified Institutional Vision for 2026 Yoyee closed by underscoring Bybit’s dedication to shaping the industry’s most complete and future-ready institutional ecosystem. ‘At Bybit, our philosophy is simple: listen, care, improve. Today’s innovations reflect our focus on delivering smarter credit and faster execution — and we are just getting started.’ #Bybit / #CryptoArk About Bybit Bybit is the world’s second-largest cryptocurrency exchange by trading volume, serving a global community of over 70 million users.

As the development updates morph in line and the demand increases in Q4, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is gaining popularity as a potential early-stage token with the structure, timing and design to result in a significant shift by 2027. What Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Is Creating Mutuum Finance is developing a decentralised lending network that consists of two related markets. In peer to contract, assets are lent by users (e.g. ETH or USDT) and earn mtTokens which increase in value as interest is repaid by borrowers. The Peer to Peer space provides an environment where the borrowers establish direct borrowing contracts in which rates vary in response to liquidity. Loan to value regulations direct secure borrowing and in occasions where the collateral is below a certain limit, liquidators pay back a portion of the debt and fund collateral at a discounted rate. Such mechanics contribute to stabilizing the real-time lending and borrowing. Mutuum Finance stated in the official X account that it is going to release its V1 testnet in Q4 2025. Lending pool, mtTokens, the liquidation module and the debt system will be presented in V1. At launch support will be provided to ETH and USDT. Halborn Security is checking the smart contracts to make sure that they behave as intended in the future. These developments have increased investor confidence as the project moves to the second phase. Investor Count and Funding Growth There have been significant initial involvements by Mutuum Finance. The project has become self-reward with a total of more than 18,400 investors because of the amount of money raised in this area which is $19.2M. Capital strength is important as lending requirements require a high level of deep initial liquidity and a wide usage base to be efficient. The project will have a better starting point when V1 is launched because a good base of users will be in place. It started off at $0.01 and currently sells at $0.035, which is 250% higher than it was at the time of initial development. The next stage, with almost 20% price increase, has been forcing a large number of new purchasers to come on board prior to the change. The overall impact of the increase in price levels and legitimate milestones in development has enabled Mutuum Finance to be ranked among top crypto projects with less than $0.05. Involving the Community and Token Distribution There are 4 billion tokens in Mutuum Finance. Something over 1.82 billion of this supply is reserved to presale phase stages, or 45.5% of the total supply. It has already purchased over 810 million MUTM tokens. Large distribution limits the concentration risk and helps in growth driven by communities. The project has a 24-hour leaderboard which gives the best contributor of the day an award of $500 in MUTM. This maintains the activity level and enhances visibility in areas. Mutuum Finance also accepts card payment so that individuals can become members without any complex wallet productions. This is backed up with a CertiK audit, in which the project scored 90/100 on doubling the Token Scan, and is currently under an examination by Halborn Security . Such measures are significant when a lending protocol is about to deal with collateral, liquidations and actual borrowing conduct. Phase 6 Approaching Completion Phase 6 is currently being sold at a rapid pace, and is allotted over 95%. A few units of the tokens are still left at the present price of $0.035. Later stages of presale go on at a significantly faster speed since users know when the next price increase would take place and they would rather secure their positions early. The entry of a whale of more than $100K to the project within recent times aided in depleting available quantity and in raising the focus of more people towards the project. The inflows by the whales are usually read as an indicator of confidence as the big entries are usually made when big milestones are in view. Mutuum Finance is building an entire lending system with yield on the minted tokens, dynamic lending logic, a stablecoin in development, oracle framework, layer-2 strategies and certified security. It has been growing by 250%, currently holding over 18,400, having raised over $19.2M in funds and with its Phase 6 window nearly passed, the project is approaching the goal with a high pace.

55539639,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=239519,1765266011,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,"Revealed: How a Deepfake Hack Caused the Massive UXLINK Exploit, Not a Rug Pull",https://bitcoinworld.co.in/uxlink-hack-deepfake-exploit-details/,"BitcoinWorld Revealed: How a Deepfake Hack Caused the Massive UXLINK Exploit, Not a Rug Pull The crypto community was shaken in September when news broke of a multi-million dollar exploit on UXLINK. Immediate whispers of an ‘inside job’ or rug pull spread like wildfire. However, the platform’s team has now presented compelling evidence pointing to a far more sinister and sophisticated cause: a deepfake-enabled external hack. This revelation shifts the narrative from potential malpractice to a stark warning about next-generation digital threats in Web3. What Really Caused the UXLINK Hack? According to a detailed statement from CEO RollandSaf, the September 22nd incident, which led to the loss of approximately $11 million in assets, was the result of a meticulously planned external attack. The hacker did not brute-force the system’s code. Instead, they employed social engineering tactics of alarming sophistication. The attacker posed as a legitimate business partner. Using deepfake technology, they conducted convincing video conferences to gain the trust of a UXLINK team member. This elaborate ruse was the key that unlocked access to the team member’s Telegram account and personal device. How Did the Attacker Exploit the UXLINK System? With this unauthorized access, the hacker’s actions were swift and devastating. They seized control of a critical smart contract. This control allowed them to perform an illegal function: minting billions of arb-UXLINK tokens out of thin air. Supply Inflation: The total token supply was artificially inflated to over 10.006 trillion. Funds Access: The breach also provided unauthorized access to the project’s treasury and ecosystem funds. Immediate Fallout: The event triggered panic, with many fearing a classic ‘rug pull’ where developers abandon a project after stealing funds. UXLINK’s Crisis Response and User Compensation Facing the crisis while attending Korea Blockchain Week (KBW), the UXLINK team initiated a global response. They immediately coordinated with major cryptocurrency exchanges to freeze suspicious transactions. Furthermore, they engaged top security firms for forensic analysis and alerted multinational law enforcement agencies. The recovery process was multi-faceted and user-focused: Contract Rebuild: The compromised smart contract was completely scrapped and rebuilt from the ground up. Token Restoration: 479 million circulating UXLINK tokens were restored on a strict one-to-one basis for legitimate holders. Community Governance: A governance vote was held, resulting in the early unlock of 12% of tokens specifically to compensate affected users. Buyback Initiative: Some of the recovered assets were used for a token buyback to help stabilize the ecosystem. Why This UXLINK Incident Is a Warning for Web3 This exploit transcends a simple smart contract bug. It highlights a critical vulnerability in the human layer of blockchain security. Deepfake technology is becoming increasingly accessible, making video and audio impersonation a potent tool for hackers. This UXLINK hack serves as a case study for all Web3 projects: security must encompass not just code audits, but also team training on advanced social engineering threats. CEO RollandSaf strongly refuted the rug pull allegations, emphasizing that UXLINK is a project with real revenue streams and a substantial global user base. The team’s transparent, active response—rebuilding, compensating, and cooperating with authorities—stands in contrast to the behavior typically seen in exit scams. Conclusion: Resilience in the Face of Sophisticated Attacks The UXLINK hack story is ultimately one of resilience. It demonstrates how a decentralized project can confront a severe crisis with transparency and user-centric action. While the financial loss was significant, the platform’s swift response to the external hack, its commitment to making users whole, and its public detailing of the deepfake methodology provide a valuable lesson for the entire industry. The future of Web3 depends not only on immutable code but also on educated, vigilant communities and teams prepared for evolving digital deceptions. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Was the UXLINK incident a rug pull? No. According to the official investigation, the event was an external hack using deepfake technology to trick a team member, not an exit scam by the developers. How much was stolen in the UXLINK hack? Approximately $11 million in assets was compromised during the exploit on September 22nd. What is a deepfake hack? A deepfake hack uses artificial intelligence to create convincing fake video or audio of a person. In this case, the hacker impersonated a business partner to gain trust and access. How did UXLINK compensate its users? Through a community governance vote, 12% of tokens were unlocked early to compensate affected users. The team also restored all legitimate tokens on a 1:1 basis after rebuilding the smart contract. What has UXLINK done to prevent future hacks? UXLINK has rebuilt its smart contract system, enhanced internal security protocols, and is emphasizing training for team members on identifying advanced social engineering attacks like deepfakes. Are user funds now safe on UXLINK? The platform has restored its system with a new, audited smart contract and implemented stricter security measures. However, as with any crypto project, users should always practice personal security diligence. Found this deep dive into the UXLINK hack insightful? The world of Web3 security is constantly evolving.

Over the past week, it’s up 2%. The price sits near a key technical level that could decide the next major move. $2.04 Support Level Holds, But for How Long? According to market analyst CasiTrades, XRP has found support at the $2.04 level, which lines up with the macro 0.5 Fibonacci retracement. The price reacted at this zone over the weekend and has since remained above it. So long as this level is maintained, traders are still keeping the bullish scenario in sight. The subsequent important level will be $2.41, then the additional level will be $2.65 in case momentum continues. In case of price violations below the price at $2.04, downside levels are targeted at $1.73 and $1.64. These levels match the macro 0.618 Fibonacci zone. As the analyst explained , “Nothing has been confirmed yet, both scenarios are still fully in play.” Source: X Meanwhile, momentum readings show a possible shift. The RSI broke above a downtrend and now sits near 56. This puts the asset in a range where momentum could build if buyers step in. Weekly Structure Resembles Past Recovery Pattern Looking at the broader view, analyst ChartNerd pointed out that current price action looks similar to late 2024. At that time, XRP dipped under the 55-week EMA before making a sharp move up. The same moving average is in play now, with XRP sitting just below it. The current range between $1.9 and $3.2 has been in place for several months. XRP has closed three weekly candles above $2, keeping the lower boundary intact. A move above the $2.25–$2.5 zone would shift the structure to the upside. The analyst added, “Short-term, we will likely retest $1.9 in the coming weeks before attempting the great escape.” Away from the charts, XRP continues to see steady inflows into the US-listed spot ETFs. These funds have now brought in over $935 million since launch, according to SoSoValue data. This marks the fastest early growth for any altcoin ETF to date. While interest in derivatives has dropped, demand from regulated investment products remains strong. On-chain metrics are also active. XRP Ledger’s velocity has increased , showing that tokens are moving between wallets more frequently. However, over 510 million XRP were moved by large wallets in the past week, raising questions in the market about possible distribution or internal transfers.

The spotlight, however, shines brightly on the Australian dollar, which has surged following the Reserve Bank of Australia’s decision to maintain current interest rates. This delicate balance between regional stability and global anticipation creates a fascinating dynamic in today’s forex market. Why Are Asia FX Markets Showing Such Stability? The current calm in Asian currency markets represents a strategic pause rather than complacency. Major Asian currencies including the Japanese yen, Chinese yuan, and Singapore dollar are trading within narrow ranges as market participants adopt a wait-and-see approach. This stability stems from several key factors: Reduced volatility ahead of major central bank announcements Balanced positioning by institutional investors Technical support levels holding firm across multiple currency pairs Regional economic data meeting modest expectations The forex market typically experiences reduced activity before significant Fed meetings, but the current Asian FX stability appears more pronounced than usual. This suggests that regional fundamentals are providing a solid foundation, even as global uncertainty looms. The Australian Dollar’s Impressive Rally After RBA Hold The Reserve Bank of Australia’s decision to maintain its cash rate at 4.35% has sparked a significant rally in the Australian dollar. This move, while widely anticipated, carried important nuances that forex traders quickly recognized: Factor Impact on AUD Market Reaction Rate Hold Decision Positive Immediate appreciation Policy Statement Tone Moderately Hawkish Sustained buying pressure Inflation Outlook Cautiously Optimistic Reduced volatility The RBA’s communication emphasized continued vigilance on inflation while acknowledging progress, striking a balance that supported the Australian dollar without triggering excessive speculation. This careful calibration demonstrates how central bank communication has become as important as policy decisions themselves in today’s forex market. What to Expect from the Crucial Fed Decision All eyes now turn to the Federal Reserve, whose upcoming decision will likely determine the next major move in global currency markets. The Fed’s guidance on several key issues will be critical: Interest rate projections for the remainder of 2024 Assessment of recent inflation data trends Guidance on quantitative tightening timeline Economic growth forecasts and risk assessments The forex market has priced in various scenarios, but the actual Fed communication could trigger significant repricing across Asian currency pairs. Traders should pay particular attention to any changes in the “dot plot” projections and Chair Powell’s press conference tone. How Central Bank Policies Shape the Forex Market Landscape The current situation perfectly illustrates how divergent central bank policies create trading opportunities in the forex market. While the RBA maintains a steady course, other Asian central banks face different challenges: Bank of Japan balancing yen weakness with inflation targets People’s Bank of China managing yuan stability amid economic stimulus Regional banks navigating between Fed policy and domestic priorities This policy divergence creates what forex traders call “carry trade opportunities,” where investors borrow in low-yielding currencies to invest in higher-yielding ones. The Australian dollar often features prominently in such strategies, especially when its yield advantage is supported by stable monetary policy. Actionable Insights for Forex Market Participants Navigating the current Asia FX environment requires strategic thinking and careful risk management. Consider these approaches: Monitor correlation patterns between Asian currencies and major global indicators Implement position sizing that accounts for potential Fed-induced volatility Watch for technical breakouts from the current consolidation ranges Prepare contingency plans for various Fed announcement scenarios The forex market rewards those who prepare for multiple outcomes while maintaining discipline in execution. Current conditions offer both opportunities for strategic positioning and risks from unexpected policy shifts. FAQs: Understanding Today’s Asia FX Dynamics What caused the Australian dollar’s recent strength? The Australian dollar gained following the Reserve Bank of Australia ‘s decision to hold interest rates steady, coupled with a policy statement that maintained a moderately hawkish tone regarding inflation concerns. How do Fed decisions typically impact Asian currencies? Federal Reserve policies significantly influence Asian currencies through interest rate differentials, capital flows, and global risk sentiment. The upcoming decision by the Federal Reserve will likely set the tone for Asian FX trading in the coming weeks. Which Asian currencies are most sensitive to Fed policy changes? Currencies with high liquidity and open capital accounts, particularly the Japanese yen and Singapore dollar, tend to show immediate reactions to Fed announcements. Emerging market currencies may experience more pronounced moves depending on risk appetite. What should traders watch in Jerome Powell’s press conference? Market participants will closely analyze comments from Jerome Powell regarding inflation persistence, labor market conditions, and the potential timing of any policy shifts. His tone and specific wording often trigger market movements. How are other Asian central banks likely to respond? Regional banks including the Bank of Japan and People’s Bank of China will monitor Fed actions but will primarily focus on domestic economic conditions when making policy decisions. Conclusion: A Market at the Crossroads The current stability in Asia FX markets represents the calm before a potentially significant storm. The Australian dollar’s reaction to the RBA decision demonstrates how carefully markets parse central bank communications, while the broader Asian currency stability shows disciplined positioning ahead of global events. As the forex market awaits the Fed’s guidance, participants must balance opportunity with caution, recognizing that today’s calm could quickly give way to tomorrow’s volatility. The coming days will reveal whether Asian currencies can maintain their composure or whether global forces will dictate their direction.

The platform will change the name of Stratis (STRAX) to Xertra, effective immediately. This Stratis STRAX name change is more than a simple label swap; it signals a pivotal moment for the project and its community. If you’re a holder or trader, understanding the implications is crucial. What Does the Stratis to Xertra Name Change Mean? The announcement came directly from Bithumb, stating the Stratis STRAX name change to Xertra would take effect at 8:00 a.m. UTC. For users, this means the ticker and display name on the exchange will be updated. However, the core question remains: why now?

Why Should Crypto Investors Pay Attention? A name change can have tangible effects. Let’s break down the immediate and potential long-term impacts for anyone involved with the token. Trading Continuity: Your holdings are safe. The Stratis STRAX name change is purely cosmetic on the exchange interface. Your wallet balance and the underlying asset remain unchanged. Market Perception: A fresh name like Xertra can generate renewed interest and media coverage, potentially affecting trading volume and price discovery in the short term. Future Development: This often precedes or accompanies announcements about technological upgrades, new partnerships, or expanded use cases for the blockchain. Navigating the Change: A Step-by-Step Guide for Bithumb Users Wondering what you need to do? The process is designed to be seamless for Bithumb’s users. Here’s what to expect: At the designated time, the ticker ‘STRAX’ will be replaced with the new ‘Xertra’ designation across the exchange. All existing open orders for STRAX will be automatically migrated to the new Xertra ticker. Your transaction history and portfolio value will reflect the update without any manual action required on your part. Always double-check the ticker symbol when placing new orders post-change to avoid confusion. Beyond the Name: What’s Next for the Project? While the immediate focus is on the Stratis STRAX name change on Bithumb, the broader story lies with the project’s future. A rebrand to Xertra suggests a deliberate pivot. Investors should monitor official channels for subsequent announcements that clarify the project’s new direction, vision, and technological roadmap. This could involve enhancements to its blockchain platform, focusing on enterprise solutions, or launching new decentralized applications. Final Verdict: A Strategic Refresh or a Fundamental Shift? In conclusion, Bithumb’s decision to implement the Stratis STRAX name change to Xertra is a noteworthy event that blends operational logistics with strategic signaling. For traders, it’s a straightforward update. For investors, it’s a cue to look deeper. The true impact will be determined not by the new name itself, but by the substance and innovation that the Xertra project delivers in the coming months. Staying informed is your most powerful tool in navigating this evolution. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q: Is my STRAX cryptocurrency disappearing because of the name change? A: No. The Stratis STRAX name change to Xertra is only a rebranding of the token’s name and ticker on Bithumb. The underlying asset and your holdings remain completely intact and secure. Q: Do I need to move my STRAX tokens to a different wallet? A: No action is required for your stored tokens. Whether they are on the Bithumb exchange or in a private wallet, they will automatically be recognized under the new Xertra name where applicable. The blockchain address does not change. Q: Will trading be halted during the changeover? A: According to Bithumb’s announcement, the change is effective at a specific time (8:00 a.m. UTC). Typically, such updates are instantaneous, but there might be a brief moment where the old ticker is replaced. It’s advisable to check the exchange at the time for the smoothest experience. Q: Why would a project change its name from Stratis to Xertra? A> Common reasons include a shift in business strategy, distancing from past perceptions, aligning with a new technological focus, or creating a stronger, more distinctive brand identity in the competitive crypto market. Q: How does this affect the price of the token? A> Price impact is unpredictable. Rebranding can generate positive attention and trading volume, but sustained price movement depends on the fundamental value and future developments announced alongside the Stratis STRAX name change . Q: Are other exchanges also changing the name to Xertra? A> Bithumb’s announcement is specific to its platform. Other exchanges that list the token will make their own independent decisions regarding the name change. You should check announcements from other platforms where you trade.

Amid the bullish news, the King of Altcoins’ price is attempting to break out of a two-month resistance, which could set the stage for a retest of higher levels. Related Reading: XRP ETFs Record 13-Day Streak As SOL Funds See Largest Outflows Since Launch BlackRock Files For Staked Ethereum ETF BlackRock has submitted an S-1 form with the US SEC to get approval for its iShares Ethereum Staking Trust (ETHB), which “seeks to reflect generally the performance of the price of ether and rewards from staking a portion of the Trust’s ether, to the extent the Sponsor in its sole discretion determines that the Trust may do so without incurring undue legal or regulatory risk.” Filed on December 5, BlackRock’s registration statement explains that, if approved, the proposed fund aims to stake 70% to 90% of its Ethereum holdings, distributing staking rewards to stakeholders at least quarterly. Coinbase Custody Trust will serve as the custodian for the Trust’s ETH holdings, the filing noted, while Anchorage Digital Bank will be an available alternative custodian for the Trust’s ether holdings. Meanwhile, the Bank of New York Mellon will serve as the custodian for the Trust’s cash holdings and the administrator of the Trust. Notably, BlackRock’s ETHB will operate separately from its spot ETH fund, the iShares Ethereum Trust ETF (ETHA), which is the largest in its category with $11 billion in assets under management (AUM). It’s worth noting that the crypto community began speculating about BlackRock’s upcoming staked ETH fund after the leading asset manager registered the name in Delaware last month. In a November report, 10x Research argued that the potential introduction of a staked Ethereum ETF by BlackRock would bring “increased scrutiny” to “the economics of DATs” as retail investors would reallocate to a low-cost source of yield. The report added that many investors are unaware that Digital Asset Treasury (DATs)’s embedded costs “far exceed” the management fee charged by asset managers like BlackRock on its Bitcoin (BTC) and ETH ETFs. ETH Nears Key Downtrend Line Ethereum’s price started the week attempting to reclaim a crucial area after managing to hold the $3,000 level as support despite the volatility during the weekend. The cryptocurrency surged nearly 3% in the daily timeframe, hitting $3,180 before retracing on Monday. Amid this performance, analyst Ali Martinez suggested that “it’s time to pay attention to ETH,” noting that it nears a key level that could push the price to higher zones. Per the chart, Ethereum briefly broke out of its two-month downtrend line, which has served as resistance since early October. Over this period, the King of Altcoins has attempted to break out of this level twice, but has ultimately been rejected during each attempt. On Monday morning, ETH briefly broke above the trendline before being rejected a third time. However, if Ethereum reclaims the $3,120-$3,130 levels and turns the downtrend into support, it could build the base for a retest of the $3,200-$3,300 horizontal levels, which marks the lower boundary of its Q3 and early Q4 price range.

Meanwhile, Rekt Capital asserted that Ethereum Dominance (ETHDOM) continues to move within its macro consolidation range, holding support at the 11.67% level. He previously affirmed that if “ETHDOM can maintain itself above 10.05% then it should be positioned for higher market dominance levels over time.” The analyst added that although history suggests a potential 2.5% drop to the consolidation range lows, this dip would occur “in the context of a macro move to 18%-20%” in the future. As of this writing, Ethereum is trading at $3,114, a 13.7% increase on the weekly timeframe.

Case Closes: SEC Ends Ondo Finance Probe On Monday, Ondo Finance announced it had received formal notice that the US SEC’s two-year investigation into the platform, which started during the Biden administration, had concluded in late November with no charges. The platform now joins the list of crypto companies that have seen their cases and probes dismissed or closed without any enforcement actions this year, including Gemini , Kraken, Ripple, Coinbase, and Uniswap Labs. The SEC initiated the probe in 2024 to examine whether firms’ tokenization of Real-World Assets (RWA) complied with federal securities laws, the platform explained. Additionally, it sought to determine whether the ONDO token was a security. “Ondo’s growth and leadership in the emerging tokenization category made us a focus, but not a justified target,” the announcement added. At the time, the US regulatory environment was characterized by a “regulation by enforcement” approach, which led to caution and confusion. Nonetheless, they “remained steadfast in its conviction that regulated, transparent tokenization models like Ondo’s are not only compatible with investor-protection principles, but can strengthen them.” To Ondo Finance, this marks a “meaningful milestone” for the broader tokenization industry, which will push innovation, compliance, security, and investor protection forward, as the sector gains momentum and becomes a priority on the federal agency’s agenda. It’s worth noting that Ondo has solidified its position as a leader in the RWA sector with strategic partnerships, expansions, and the launch of its own Layer-1 blockchain, which aims to bridge the gap between traditional finance and decentralized finance. As reported by Bitcoinist, the firm aims to advance its mission to “democratize” access to high-quality US financial assets and ensure tokenized assets move seamlessly across major blockchains. A New Chapter For Tokenized Securities In the Monday statement, the platform also highlighted that the SEC’s decision reflects a broader shift in US policy, with regulators reassessing the methods used during the Biden era for the crypto industry. Earlier this year, a White House report recognized the sector as foundational to the future of the global financial system and named Ondo Finance among the key players. Notably, the regulatory agency has added tokenization to its formal agenda. In the SEC’s Investor Advisory Committee meeting last week, the regulatory agency affirmed it is evaluating tokenization to modernize the issuance, trading, and settlement of public equities. In his remarks , SEC chairman Paul Atkins stated, “Distributed ledger technology and the tokenization of financial assets, including securities, have the potential to transform our capital markets. Our financial markets have long been the envy of the world, and to ensure that they remain so, U.S. firms and investors must have the opportunity to leverage this technology as they lead the future of global capital markets.” Atkins added that the agency’s role is to enable market participants to operate and innovate under clear guardrails, ensuring that the US markets remain the most dynamic, transparent, and trusted in the world. “The resolution of the SEC inquiry marks the end of one chapter for Ondo and the beginning of another. Put simply, the time is now for tokenized securities to become a core part of U.S. capital markets. The future of global finance, including U.S. capital markets, will be onchain and Ondo will help lead that transition,” the announcement concluded.",Crypto News|Ondo|Ondo Finance|Ondo Finance SEC|ONDOUSDT|Paul Atkins|RWA tokenization|SEC Chairman|SEC crypto crackdown|SEC investigation|tokenized securities|US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC),EN,0,0,BUSINESS|MARKET|REGULATION|ONDO|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-12-09 08:00:15

The lack of a reliable and compliant path from crypto into global bank networks has left billions effectively inactive. TrustLinq provides a regulated infrastructure layer that enables cryptocurrency holdings to fund fiat-denominated transactions in more than 70 currencies through established settlement channels without the need of having a bank account. According to recent industry estimates, approximately 580 million individuals and businesses worldwide hold cryptocurrency, while only around 15,000 merchants accept it directly. This represents less than 0.003% global real-world usability. Analysts have consistently identified this gap as a major structural issue, leaving large amounts of cryptocurrency effectively unusable within traditional financial systems. TrustLinq operates within this space, providing a regulated infrastructure layer that enables cryptocurrency holdings to fund fiat-denominated transactions across global banking networks. The platform is built within a Swiss-regulated framework and incorporates structured operational controls, secure asset-handling processes and multi-jurisdiction settlement connectivity. These elements create an infrastructure layer that is difficult to reproduce due to regulatory, technical and procedural requirements. The configuration is designed to support predictable, transparent and scalable cryptocurrency-funded fiat transactions across borders. “Global participation in cryptocurrency continues to grow, but the connection between decentralised assets and traditional financial systems has remained limited,” said Sharon Gal Franko, CEO of TrustLinq. “TrustLinq was built to provide an infrastructure layer that bridges cryptocurrency with established fiat settlement networks in a regulated and controlled environment.” TrustLinq is accessible to individuals and businesses in eligible jurisdictions. Supported cryptocurrencies at launch include USDT on ERC20 and TRC20, USDC and EURC. Additional settlement routes, technical integrations and platform capabilities are under development as part of the company’s roadmap. Payments industry specialists have identified the emergence of a new infrastructure category designed to enable cryptocurrency to move from self-custody into traditional financial systems without acting as an exchange, wallet provider, processor or remittance service. TrustLinq operates within this developing segment, which is increasingly recognised as its own category in financial technology. The model is referred to as Self-Custodial Crypto to Third-Party Fiat Settlement and describes an infrastructure layer that allows users to retain control of their digital assets while initiating fiat-denominated transfers to third-party recipients through regulated settlement networks. TrustLinq introduces an operational layer that bridges digital assets with traditional banking frameworks, addressing a gap not covered by existing payment or crypto models. About TrustLinq TrustLinq is a Swiss-regulated financial intermediary bridging cryptocurrency and traditional banking. The platform enables individuals and businesses holding cryptocurrency to send fiat payments to anyone, anywhere in the world, across 70+ currencies. Operating under Swiss regulation and compliant with Swiss AML, TrustLinq seamlessly enables crypto-to-fiat and executes payments globally while maintaining local payment efficiency via methods including SEPA, SWIFT, Faster Payments, ACH, and upcoming debit card solutions. The company prioritises security, compliance, and user control through a non-custodial intermediary model that does not hold client funds.

The post did not explain, yet the meaning behind the number is widely recognized in XRP circles. Due to this, many observers viewed the update as a deliberate and pointed move. The simplicity of the message made it more noticeable, especially given the recent conversations involving both networks. 589 — Solana (@solana) December 8, 2025 Why “589” Matters The number 589 has a long-standing association with a viral XRP meme. It’s from a fabricated image designed to look like a scene from The Simpsons, predicting that XRP would reach $589 by year-end. The scene never existed in the show, but the meme spread widely and became a symbol for extreme bullish expectations within parts of the XRP community. It later inspired a meme coin named XRP589, but it has never been considered a real forecast. By posting the number without comment, Solana linked itself to this cultural reference. Many readers interpreted it as a subtle comment toward XRP holders, particularly given the competitive environment surrounding recent industry developments. Tension Between Ecosystems The post also follows an exchange in early November. In response to a Ripple update, Crypto community member Jackson Knox declared that Ripple and XRP operate at a far higher level than Solana and Western Union. His message came shortly after Western Union selected Solana for a new initiative rather than choosing XRP. The remark gained attention quickly, leading Solana’s official account to respond that the projects are “not on the same level.” Solana backed that statement by referencing strong institutional support from global financial leaders. Franklin Templeton’s Head of Digital Asset Strategy, Sandy Kaul, recently described Solana as a modern, unified digital infrastructure offering investors uninterrupted access to new asset classes. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Jenny Johnson, the firm’s CEO, also referred to Solana as one of the first chains built with institutional needs in mind. Solana has used these endorsements to reinforce its positioning in the tokenization space. Community Reactions to the New Post After Solana published “589,” reactions were immediate. X Finance Bull suggested that a collaboration between Solana and XRP could still happen and claimed it may become one of the major developments in the coming months. Another user, John Squire, commented on the timing of the post and implied that Solana released the message with intention. Although Solana’s post was brief, the recent exchanges between both communities and the symbolic meaning of the number make it appear as a subtle jab at XRP , especially given the ongoing rivalry and discussion between the two ecosystems.

Slivkoff, who is a research partner at Paradigm, said this is because Polymarket’s on-chain data contains redundant blockchain events. Slivkoff claimed that an analysis of Polymarket’s market structure, smart contracts, and event data revealed that the usual approach of summing the platform’s OrderFilled events is the primary reason behind the double-counting. The approach double-counts cash flow (in USD) and the number of traded contracts. For instance, Slivkoff discovered that a simple YES/NO token sale of $4.13 is recorded as volume worth $8.26 because separate OrderFilled events represent the taker side and the maker side of the trade. The researcher emphasizes that volume on such prediction markets should be measured using either the taker side or the maker side, not both. Slivkoff dissects Polymarket’s trade anatomy The Paradigm research partner began by describing the on-chain data associated with each trade on the Polymarket platform. He pointed out that all the platform’s transactions follow a rigid template, which includes at most one group of matched Polymarket orders per Polygon transaction. Slivkoff further explained that each set of matched orders has at least one maker and precisely one taker. He also noted that trade transactions are submitted by approximately 50 EOAs affiliated with Polymarket, and that each transaction on the platform follows the same event sequence. “Polymarket’s on-chain data is quite complex, and this has led to widespread adoption of flawed accounting methods.” – Storm Slivkoff , Research Partner at Paradigm According to Slivkoff, the accounting bug inflates both commonly used types of volume metrics for cash flow volume and notional volume, as well as the prediction market. He noted that the platform’s data has been confusing for crypto data analysts who find it difficult to untangle the many interacting layers using a block explorer. Slivkoff said this difficulty arises because trades on the platform can be either simple swaps or merges and splits, where both parties exchange opposing positions for cash. He also stated that the smart contracts present redundant events for tracking, which standard blockchain explorers often fail to distinguish clearly. Paradigm builds a simulator to illustrate trading volume behavior Spreadsheet of the Polymarket volume simulator. Source: Paradigm. Paradigm revealed that its team has built a simulator to illustrate how different trading metrics behave under at least eight trading types. The simulator calculates maker/taker balance changes, open interest changes, and various volume metrics for each trade type. Slivkoff further disclosed that the YES price and the number of traded contracts are the only two inputs required for the simulation. He also suggested that crypto data analysts can make copies of the spreadsheet and change the parameters to perform their own simulations. However, Slivkoff pointed out that analysts using this simulator should take note of a few invariants. He clarified that for each trade type, the maker and taker always take opposite positions. One is a long YES resolution, and the other is a short YES resolution. Slivkoff also noted that the maker and taker YES and NO deltas always have similar absolute values. However, he added that this is different from their USDC deltas, which can have differing absolute values. The researcher also emphasized that split trades always increase open interest, while merge trades always decrease open interest. However, swap trades always leave open interest unchanged. Slivkoff noted that calculating both notional volume and cash flow volume for swap trades is straightforward. He also observed that Polymarket’s OrderFilled sum presented a value that is twice the correct figure for both of these metrics. However, he emphasized that calculating these metrics for merge trades and split trades is more complex than for a conventional swap. The smartest crypto minds already read our newsletter. Want in?

The lack of a reliable and compliant path from crypto into global bank networks has left billions effectively inactive. TrustLinq provides a regulated infrastructure layer that enables cryptocurrency holdings to fund fiat-denominated transactions in more than 70 currencies through established settlement channels without the need of having a bank account. According to recent industry estimates, approximately 580 million individuals and businesses worldwide hold cryptocurrency, while only around 15,000 merchants accept it directly. This represents less than 0.003% global real-world usability. Analysts have consistently identified this gap as a major structural issue, leaving large amounts of cryptocurrency effectively unusable within traditional financial systems. TrustLinq operates within this space, providing a regulated infrastructure layer that enables cryptocurrency holdings to fund fiat-denominated transactions across global banking networks. The platform is built within a Swiss-regulated framework and incorporates structured operational controls, secure asset-handling processes and multi-jurisdiction settlement connectivity. These elements create an infrastructure layer that is difficult to reproduce due to regulatory, technical and procedural requirements. The configuration is designed to support predictable, transparent and scalable cryptocurrency-funded fiat transactions across borders. “Global participation in cryptocurrency continues to grow, but the connection between decentralised assets and traditional financial systems has remained limited,” said Sharon Gal Franko, CEO of TrustLinq. “TrustLinq was built to provide an infrastructure layer that bridges cryptocurrency with established fiat settlement networks in a regulated and controlled environment.” TrustLinq is accessible to individuals and businesses in eligible jurisdictions. Supported cryptocurrencies at launch include USDT on ERC20 and TRC20, USDC and EURC. Additional settlement routes, technical integrations and platform capabilities are under development as part of the company’s roadmap. Payments industry specialists have identified the emergence of a new infrastructure category designed to enable cryptocurrency to move from self-custody into traditional financial systems without acting as an exchange, wallet provider, processor or remittance service. TrustLinq operates within this developing segment, which is increasingly recognised as its own category in financial technology. The model is referred to as Self-Custodial Crypto to Third-Party Fiat Settlement and describes an infrastructure layer that allows users to retain control of their digital assets while initiating fiat-denominated transfers to third-party recipients through regulated settlement networks. TrustLinq introduces an operational layer that bridges digital assets with traditional banking frameworks, addressing a gap not covered by existing payment or crypto models. About TrustLinq TrustLinq is a Swiss-regulated financial intermediary bridging cryptocurrency and traditional banking. The platform enables individuals and businesses holding cryptocurrency to send fiat payments to anyone, anywhere in the world, across 70+ currencies. Operating under Swiss regulation and compliant with Swiss AML, TrustLinq seamlessly enables crypto-to-fiat and executes payments globally while maintaining local payment efficiency via methods including SEPA, SWIFT, Faster Payments, ACH, and upcoming debit card solutions. The company prioritises security, compliance, and user control through a non-custodial intermediary model that does not hold client funds.

Over the past week, the price is up by 24%. Consequently, the move follows a breakout from a technical setup where price cleared $407, flipping that area into a support zone. The short-term trend remains upward, but traders are watching for signs of pressure near the next resistance levels. Breakout Holds as Price Approaches Resistance ZEC is moving toward the 0.382 Fibonacci retracement level at $472. This area may act as near-term resistance. If the price breaks through, traders are likely to watch the $525 and $616 levels next. These zones align with previous ranges where the price has paused or reversed in the past. The 50-period moving average around $357 has offered support on the way up. On the 4-hour chart, this level marks the midpoint of the recent trend. Zcash (ZEC) price chart 09.12. Source: TradingView Meanwhile, the RSI is at 69, near the overbought zone. Momentum is strong, but the current reading suggests the pace may slow before a clear next move develops. Whales Buy as Retail Sells Recent data shared by analyst Ardi shows different behavior between retail and institutional players. According to him, “Retail ($0–$1k) and mid-sized ($1k–$100k) accounts are aggressively selling,” while wallets holding $100k to $10M are increasing their positions. Over $30 million in smaller account holdings were sold recently, while larger wallets bought $100 million in the same time. Ardi described the move as “institutional absorption”, with large buyers picking up supply being sold at market. He added, “You are handing your coins directly to the entities who are trying to rip this higher.” In a separate view, analyst BeLaunch noted a price rejection near $425. This was followed by lower volume on the advance and reduced positioning from short-term holders. While 24-hour holders are still active, capital flow data showed a mixed picture. Derivatives saw outflows, while spot markets recorded new inflows. New Fee Proposal and ETF Conversion Plans Additionally, the Zcash development team has proposed a change to the way fees work during periods of congestion. The update would base transaction fees on the median of the last 50 blocks. A 10x fee lane would allow priority transactions during high demand. The rollout will happen in phases. The upgrade is expected to go through a consensus change, without a full redesign. Separately, Grayscale submitted a proposal to convert its Zcash Trust into an ETF last month, as we reported . If approved, this could allow traditional investors access to ZEC exposure through a regulated product without needing to hold the asset.

According to some experts, this may be one of the final early-stage DeFi tokens whose realistic setup could be able to see 20x move before 2027. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is currently experiencing attention because its allocation approaches expiry and it gains momentum. Presale Growth, Price Movement and What MUTM Is Building Mutuum Finance started at $0.01 in early 2025, and is currently at $0.035, with a 250% increase in the process of development. The project has a volume of raised funds/money $19.2M, obtained over 18,400 holders and sold over 810M tokens. Among the 4B supply, 1.82B or 45.5% of the tokens are set for the presale phases. The supply at this price is now less than 95% with not much supply to be observed at this stage. The project has also ensured a 20% increase in prices forms part of the next crypto phase hence one of the factors that have made demand increase at an expedited pace over the last two weeks. Investors are rushing in before the next level enters into the scene at a higher cost. Mutuum Finance is also working on a decentralized financial lending model which consists of two environments that are interconnected. Users can borrow assets including ETH, USDT and be provided with mtTokens, whose value increases as borrowers repay interest. Borrowers get to deal with rates that change with liquidity. Safe use of collateral is conducted by loan-to-value rules and an event of liquidation is witnessed when collateral becomes too low. Such design makes the protocol useful in reality rather than through hype authorities. V1 Launch, Security Layers and Extremes Price Estimation Mutuum Finance (MUTM) via its official X account by stating that the V1 testnet should land in Q4 2025. V1 proposes the liquidation module, the debt engine, and the lending pool, which is called, mtokens. New: ETH and USDT will be launched. The launch of V1 will likely be the original major turning point of the protocol, as individuals will then be able to get into contact with the system. Preparation of security has been high. The project underwent a CertiK audit and the score of the Token Scan analysis is 90/100, and Halborn Security is checking the lending contracts. There is a bug bounty of $50K which is in force and can be used to find any loopholes prior to release to the public. Resting on these factors, a number of analysts forecast that MUTM may experience a 5x -7x growth as soon as V1 will start producing a borrowing and lending activity. Buy Pressure Revenue Mutuum Finance has one of the most powerful components, which is its mtToken system. mtTokens appreciate each interest repaid by borrowers. By lending in even a dollar of ETH the user can get an increased number of mtTokens as the activity increases. These links yield to actual use. A buy and distribute mechanism is also involved in the protocol. MUTM is sold to the market through a share of platform revenue and purchased tokens are distributed to those who stake mtTokens. This establishes consistent buy pressure that is pegged on the volume of lending. It is also the project with a 24-hour leaderboard, thanks to which, the best contributor on a daily basis is given a $500 of MUTM. The platform can accept card payments and therefore it is usable by new users willing to have a simple onboarding. As activities scale the mtToken model and the buy pressure scale, some analysts now put MUTM in a 10x to 12x gap in case the activity can grow once the system goes live. Layer-2 Expansion Mutuum Finance is in the process of developing a USD-pegged interest-backed borrower-backed stablecoin. This is due to the fact that stablecoins enable the lending platform to extend due to their ability to allow borrowers to take out predictable value and increase liquidity. Stablecoin borrowing increases and boosts the income and purchase pressure when the demand of the mtTokens increases. The expansion of Layer-2 will be done at subsequent stages of the roadmap. The L2 networks are used to enable quicker and less costly transactions. Lending systems require rapidity in executing the checks of collateral, borrowing updates and liquidation events and L2 scaling assists the protocol to run with better efficiency. Chainlink will serve as the primary oracle provider used by Mutuum Finance with the help of aggregated sources of prices. Right pricing is essential when there is liquidation that is safe and tracking collateral. Naturally, due to the introduction of stablecoins and the growth of L2s, a number of long-range predictions have now positioned MUTM in a 15x to 20x range as the protocol could reach maturity by 2027. Phase 6 Acceleration and Whale Entries Phase 6 is rapidly selling off, allocation is now more than 95%. A very limited supply is as low as the $0.035 level. The second pricing point will be with a nearly 20% increment, which has compelled most of the buyers to do it earlier. A more recent allocation of whales over $100K served to dry up the available stock. Whale traders are commonly considered a positive sign, as a big-box holder is likely to purchase before such a significant milestone as V1. As demand grows, Phase 6 allocation is nearing 100% completion, audited and an impending testnet, there are numerous traders with the conviction that Mutuum Finance could be one of the best crypto candidates in the long-term.

While the US Dollar remains largely flat, the Euro has begun to edge higher in what could be a pivotal shift. For cryptocurrency traders watching traditional finance for signals, this moment reveals how central bank decisions ripple across all asset classes, from fiat currencies to digital assets. Why is the Federal Reserve Decision So Critical for Currency Markets? All eyes turn to the Federal Reserve this week as policymakers prepare to announce their latest interest rate decision. The central bank’s guidance on future monetary policy will determine whether the US Dollar maintains its dominance or faces renewed pressure. Currency markets have entered a holding pattern, with traders unwilling to make significant moves until they hear directly from Chair Jerome Powell and the FOMC. The US Dollar’s Unusual Flatness: What Does It Signal? The US Dollar Index (DXY), which measures the greenback against a basket of major currencies, has shown remarkable stability in recent sessions. This flat trading pattern suggests several market realities: Traders have priced in most expected outcomes already Positioning has become extremely cautious ahead of the announcement Market participants await fresh signals about the timing of potential rate cuts The dollar’s safe-haven status provides underlying support despite uncertainty Euro Gains Ground: A Turning Point for European Currency? While the dollar stalls, the Euro has managed to climb against several major counterparts. This movement reflects growing confidence in the European economic outlook and diminishing concerns about immediate recession risks. The Euro’s performance against the dollar will be particularly telling after the Fed announcement, as it may signal whether European Central Bank policies are gaining relative effectiveness. Currency Pair Recent Movement Key Support Level Key Resistance Level EUR/USD +0.3% 1.0800 1.0950 GBP/USD +0.1% 1.2600 1.2800 USD/JPY -0.2% 150.00 152.00 How Interest Rates Decisions Shape Global Currency Flows The relationship between central bank policies and currency values remains fundamental. When the Federal Reserve adjusts interest rates, it directly affects: Yield differentials between US assets and international alternatives Capital flows seeking higher returns Carry trade profitability Relative attractiveness of dollar-denominated investments Current market pricing suggests traders expect the Fed to maintain rates while potentially signaling a more dovish stance for future meetings. Any deviation from this expectation could trigger significant volatility across currency markets. Trading Implications: Navigating Currency Markets Before Major Announcements Experienced traders understand that periods of apparent calm often precede major moves. The current flatness in the US Dollar presents both challenges and opportunities: Reduced liquidity can amplify moves once direction becomes clear Position sizing becomes crucial when volatility is expected to spike Stop-loss placement requires extra consideration ahead of news events Correlations between currency pairs may break down temporarily What History Tells Us About Post-Fed Currency Movements Analyzing previous Federal Reserve decisions reveals patterns that informed traders watch closely. Typically, the initial reaction to the statement lasts approximately 15-30 minutes, followed by a more sustained move during the press conference. The Euro’s recent strength suggests that some traders are positioning for a dovish Fed outcome, though this remains far from certain. Actionable Insights for Currency Traders Based on current market conditions, several strategies merit consideration: Reduce position sizes ahead of the announcement to manage risk Monitor EUR/USD for breakout opportunities above 1.0950 or below 1.0800 Watch for divergence between the Fed’s statement and market expectations Consider volatility-based strategies rather than directional bets The Bottom Line: A Pivotal Moment for Global Currencies The Federal Reserve’s upcoming decision represents a crucial inflection point for currency markets. The US Dollar’s current flatness reflects market uncertainty, while the Euro’s gains suggest shifting sentiment. Traders must prepare for potential volatility while recognizing that central bank communications often matter more than the actual rate decision itself. The coming days will reveal whether current positioning proves prescient or requires rapid adjustment. To learn more about the latest Forex market trends, explore our articles on key developments shaping currency movements and central bank policies. Frequently Asked Questions Who leads the Federal Reserve’s decision-making process? The Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) makes interest rate decisions, currently chaired by Jerome Powell . The committee includes Federal Reserve Board members and regional Federal Reserve Bank presidents. What is the European Central Bank’s current stance? The European Central Bank , led by President Christine Lagarde, has maintained a cautious approach to monetary policy while monitoring inflation trends and economic growth indicators. How do currency markets typically react to Fed decisions? Historical analysis shows that currency markets often experience increased volatility around Federal Reserve announcements, with the US Dollar particularly sensitive to changes in interest rate expectations and forward guidance. What tools do traders use to analyze currency movements? Traders utilize technical analysis, economic indicators, and central bank communications to assess currency markets. Platforms like Bloomberg and Reuters provide essential data and analysis for informed decision-making.

The 22-year-old man, Evan Tangeman, admitted to participating in a Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organization in a plea deal before U.S. District Court Judge Colleen Kollar-Kotelly. According to the prosecutors in the case, the stolen crypto, 4,100 BTC, was worth approximately $263 million at the time of the theft and has since increased in value to roughly $368.5 million. The federal prosecutors revealed that Tangeman laundered approximately $3.5 million on behalf of the organization. Tangeman used false identities to acquire rental properties for the members of the social engineering group. Tangeman becomes the ninth defendant to enter a guilty plea Evan Tangeman is the ninth defendant to plead guilty in the investigation into the crypto laundering scheme, which has so far revealed a network of hackers, target identifiers, and residential burglars operating since October 2023. The court filings revealed that the scheme originated as a small group of acquaintances on an online gaming platform, which evolved into a coordinated criminal network operating across California, New York, Florida, Connecticut, and other locations outside America. According to court documents, the hackers utilized a stolen database to target victims with substantial cryptocurrency holdings. The organization then used callers to contact the identified victims directly by luring them into giving compromising information about their accounts. The prosecutors stated that callers told victims their accounts had been compromised and that they needed to take immediate action to safeguard their assets. The scheme relied heavily on social engineering tricks rather than sophisticated technical exploits. The hackers were also allegedly involved with a group of individuals who planned and made physical break-ins to target hardware wallets. The residential burglars targeted victims who store digital wallets or seed phrases in their homes. The group’s stolen proceeds have been linked to several expenditures, including nightclub services, luxury handbags, watches, rental properties, private jet rentals, and private security guards. The purchases were distributed across multiple states and internationally to conceal their identity. Tangeman used a bulk cash converter to convert crypto into cash, which he used to secure rental homes for the group. He used a false name on the lease documents, preventing property owners and authorities from identifying the true occupants. The Court unseals a second superseding indictment Three additional defenders, including Nicholas Dellecave, Mustafa Ibrahim, and Danish Zulfiqar, have been arrested and charged after Tangeman’s plea deal. The court unsealed the second superseding indictment charging the three additional defendants with participation in the social engineering enterprise. The U.S. government Department of Justice revealed that the case is part of a broad effort to target crypto-related fraud operations that rely on social engineering rather than technical hacking methods. Prosecutors have revealed that the hacker group has newly unsealed charges that were not previously included in the trial dates for the newly identified defendants. The court filings revealed that the stolen cryptocurrency transactions, rental agreements, communication logs, and bulk cash conversion activity were used to trace the identities of the defendants. So far, Tangeman remains free pending sentencing on April 24, 2026. However, the range of penalties he may face under the federal sentencing guidelines for RICO conspiracy and money laundering is yet to be determined. The Justice Department also revealed that the additional defendants may be charged as the investigation continues. The court has also not revealed whether it has recovered the stolen BTC or any part of it, and whether restitution will be sought as part of the sentencing.

This isn’t a sign of trouble, however, but a calculated and aggressive strategy. The firm is deliberately prioritizing massive market expansion over immediate profitability. For anyone watching the evolution of crypto-based prediction markets, this move signals a pivotal moment in the race for dominance. Why is Polymarket Operating at a Loss? In a recent interview, CEO Shayne Coplan made the company’s position clear. While Polymarket is not against making money, its primary focus is on creation and growth. “The most important goal at present is to grow the prediction market as much as possible and secure maximum market share,” Coplan stated. This philosophy places long-term network effects and user acquisition above short-term financial gains. Essentially, they are investing every available resource into becoming the default platform for global event betting. This approach is common in high-growth tech but remains a bold gamble in the volatile crypto sector. The decision for Polymarket operating at a loss hinges on a key belief: that the prediction market space is still in its infancy. By capturing users and liquidity now, they aim to build an unassailable lead that will pay off tremendously in the future. How Does Polymarket’s Business Model Work? Understanding why Polymarket operating at a loss is a strategic choice requires a look at its mechanics. Polymarket functions similarly to a sportsbook but for real-world events. Users bet on outcomes like election results or financial milestones. The Spread: Like traditional betting, Polymarket uses a ‘spread’—a small fee built into the odds. Redistribution: Critically, Coplan explained that these spreads are not kept as pure profit. Instead, they are redistributed to liquidity providers. The Goal: This incentivizes users to add funds to market pools, creating deeper, more efficient markets that attract more users. It’s a classic flywheel effect, and fueling it is costly upfront. Therefore, the current state of Polymarket operating at a loss funds this cycle. The money that could be profit is being reinvested to bootstrap liquidity and improve the platform’s core utility. What Are the Risks and Potential Rewards? Choosing growth over profit is a high-stakes strategy. The primary risk is straightforward: burning through capital without achieving the necessary scale to become profitable later. The crypto market is fickle, and regulatory hurdles for prediction markets are significant. However, the potential reward is market domination. If Polymarket succeeds, it could become the central hub for a multi-billion dollar industry. The first-mover advantage in a networked business like this is powerful. By accepting Polymarket operating at a loss today, Coplan’s team is betting they can define the future of how people speculate on world events. What Does This Mean for the Future of Prediction Markets? Polymarket’s aggressive stance is a clear signal that the prediction market arena is heating up. This move pressures competitors and demonstrates a long-term vision that goes beyond quarterly earnings. It shows a commitment to building a fundamental new financial primitive on the blockchain. For users, this period of Polymarket operating at a loss likely translates to a better experience—more markets, better liquidity, and continuous platform improvements—as all revenue is funneled back into growth. It’s a user acquisition play on a grand scale. Conclusion: A Calculated Gamble for Ultimate Dominance Shayne Coplan’s transparency about Polymarket operating at a loss is refreshing and strategic. It reveals a company playing a long game, willing to sacrifice immediate profit for exponential future gain. This isn’t a story of a struggling startup; it’s the story of a well-funded contender making a power move to own an entire category. The coming years will show if this bold bet on expansion pays off with the market leadership Polymarket seeks. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q: Is Polymarket in financial trouble because it’s operating at a loss? A: Not necessarily. Many successful tech companies (like Amazon and Uber in their early years) operated at a loss initially to prioritize rapid growth and market capture. Polymarket’s CEO has framed this as a deliberate strategy. Q: How long can Polymarket sustain operating at a loss? A> This depends on its funding reserves and investor support. The strategy implies they have secured enough capital (from venture funding or other sources) to fund this expansion phase until they achieve their target market share. Q: If Polymarket isn’t making a profit, where does its revenue go? A> According to CEO Shayne Coplan, the revenue from spreads is primarily redistributed to liquidity providers. This incentivizes more trading and deeper markets, which is core to their growth plan. Q: What does ‘securing market share’ mean for a prediction market? A> It means attracting the most users and the most liquidity. In prediction markets, liquidity is king—deeper markets have fairer prices and attract more users, creating a powerful network effect that is hard for competitors to challenge. Q: Could this strategy benefit users? A> Yes, potentially. During this growth phase, users may see more investment in new features, a wider variety of markets, and better liquidity (tighter spreads), as the platform uses its resources to improve the product and attract participants.

Here’s why,https://timestabloid.com/this-trader-urges-elon-musk-to-buy-200m-xrp-heres-why/,"A recent post on X from Chain Cartel (@chaincartel) offered a striking proposal for Elon Musk linked to XRP. The account wrote that “Elon Musk should buy $200M XRP today so he can pay $150M EU fines for free in 2026.” Musk has come under scrutiny by the EU and faces a large fine from its regulators. This statement suggested a sharp rise for XRP next year , and provides an easy solution to the billionaire’s current problem. Elon Musk should buy $200M XRP today so he can pay $150M EU fines for free in 2026 — Chain Cartel (@chaincartel) December 7, 2025 The Fine and the Reason Behind It The EU issued a penalty of approximately €120 million, which equals roughly $140 million. The action targeted X, the social media platform Musk owns. The Commission acted under the Digital Services Act, stating that X broke rules related to account labels, data access, and ad transparency. It argued that the company used a deceptive presentation of blue check marks after changes to the verification program. It also stated that X failed to offer clear access for researchers who track public data. The Commission added that the ad repository lacked the required detail. How Much XRP Would Need to Rise The Chain Cartel comment proposed that a $200 million purchase of XRP today could grow to at least $340 million by 2026. That jump represents a required increase of roughly $140 million from the starting point. The figure equals a gain of about 70%. For that to happen, XRP must rise from $2.07 to a level high enough to create that return. If someone bought $200 million worth of XRP at the current price of $2.07, the purchase would secure over 96.6 million XRP. To reach $340 million in 2026, each token must trade at around $3.52. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 This would place XRP just under its all-time high of $3.65 , which it hit in July. However, this is the minimum amount required to pay off the fine. Some experts have suggested 2026 could be 10x bigger for XRP . A 10x surge for the digital asset would send it to $20.7, putting it firmly in the double-digit range. Will Musk Buy XRP? While Musk has yet to publicly show interest in buying XRP, this presents a major opportunity. Musk’s support for Dogecoin sent it to unimaginable levels, and promoting XRP could help it grow even higher than analysts expect. Musk has not revealed any plans to buy XRP, but the crypto world is fully aware of his pro-crypto stance. The market has produced bigger jumps in the past, and Musk could take the opportunity to pay off X’s fines. Disclaimer : This content is meant to inform and should not be considered financial advice.

The platform consolidates bridging, wallet top-ups and on-chain identity verification into a single seamless experience designed for the next generation of Web3 users. At the heart of the launch is Cronos Verify, a gasless and privacy-preserving on-chain attestation that links a user’s wallet to a verified Crypto.com account. This reflects a broader shift in Web3 toward verifiable attestations and decentralized identity standards, which are increasingly used to strengthen Sybil resistance and enable fairer incentive structures. With frameworks like EAS (Ethereum Attestation Service) gaining momentum, on-chain attestations are increasingly becoming the foundation for loyalty systems, gated utilities and cross-dApp verification signals. Through Cronos Verify, partners such as Moonlander, Delphi, Tectonic and VVS Finance are offering benefits including trading fee rebates, prediction vouchers, exclusive launchpad access and gasless transactions. These features help ensure that rewards reach real users while giving dApps confidence in the integrity of their user base. The launch also follows the start of the Cronos x402 Hackathon, where developers are already experimenting with agent-driven transactions and programmable payment flows that rely on verified identity signals. As developer interest grows in AI-assisted and automated transactions, verifiable attestations like Cronos Verify are becoming an essential layer for safe and scalable agentic infrastructure. Cronos One represents meaningful progress on the Cronos 2025–2026 roadmap and delivers on the commitment to make the ecosystem more accessible, more verifiable and ready for institutional-grade applications. This builds on recent infrastructure advancements including a 10x reduction in gas fees, sub-second block times and expanding adoption of identity-powered features across dApps. “Across Web3, on-chain privacy-preserving attestations are emerging as a critical foundational building block for more use cases,” said Mirko Zhao, Head of Cronos Labs. “Cronos One gives users a frictionless starting point and provides developers with the personhood verification they need to build fairer incentives, stronger loyalty and smarter on-chain applications.” Cronos One is now available at one.cronos.org , with additional partners and verification-based utilities planned for upcoming phases. About Cronos Labs Cronos is a leading blockchain ecosystem, supported by Crypto.com and more than 500 application developers and contributors representing an addressable user base of more than 150 million people around the world.

You can have more fines from over-regulation, or you can have a growing economy, but you can’t have both,” the Coinbase CEO wrote. His X post quoted the founder of Agentic web platform Godmode AI, David Fant, who said the EU makes more from fines on US tech than taxes from tech companies. Fant mentioned that the bloc imposed €3.8 billion ($4.4 billion) in fines on American companies in 2024 while public European internet firms contributed just €3.2 billion ($3.7 billion) in corporate taxes. EU makes more from fines on US tech, than tax from ALL of public European tech in 2024 EU fined US tech companies €3.8B meanwhile public internet tech companies paid only €3.2B in income tax https://t.co/U5YiH2Hvsa pic.twitter.com/WS16XX66Ll — david fant (@da_fant) December 8, 2025 The penalties included €400 million under the bloc’s data protection laws, and €3.4 billion under antitrust, Digital Markets Act, and Digital Services Act rules on tech giants Apple, Google , Meta, X, and TikTok. EU fine on X sparks criticism from Musk, US officials US business leaders are irate over how Brussels has allegedly turned its digital rulebook into a revenue engine that values fines over taxes. The EU’s framework includes the General Data Protection Regulation, the Digital Markets Act, the Digital Services Act, and the AI Act, all of which affect how firms handle data. Opponents say the expansion of regulations and the trading bloc’s stringent enforcement have created a climate of fear among technology firms operating in its jurisdiction. The latest confrontation came on the heels of a fine on Elon Musk’s X of about €120 million for a supposed “deceptive” blue checkmark system and failures in its advertising transparency, Cryptopolitan reported . Musk, who had dismissed the Commission’s announcement with a blunt expletive in an earlier post, responded to the fine on Saturday, saying: “The EU should be abolished and sovereignty returned to individual countries, so that governments can better represent their people.” Nikita Bier, the platform’s head of product, mocked EU officials in a sarcastic message that read: “Hello, I am Jürgen from Bruxelles. I have a masters in social business welfare studies. I demand 10% of your global revenue for violation of cookie popups.” Several American policymakers also joined Musk’s camp to publicly condemn Brussels, including Secretary of State Marco Rubio, who called the penalty against X an “attack on all American tech platforms and the American people by foreign governments.” The US ambassador to the EU, Andrew Puzder, said the “excessive €120M fine” was a clear sign of regulatory overreach to stifle American innovation, adding that Washington expects “fair, open, reciprocal trade and nothing less.” Puzder doubled down on his talking point in an interview with Bloomberg, saying the largest penalties issued under Europe’s digital rulebook have been on US platforms. “So at some point, if you’re an American company, you’ve gotta sit back and say, ‘Look, am I being targeted here?’” he continued, “Or is this an effort to try and advantage European competitors over US companies?” Vice President JD Vance went further in his sentiments to propound that the EU was cracking down on X because it would not engage in censorship. “Rumors are swirling that the EU commission will fine X hundreds of millions of dollars for not engaging in censorship,” he said on X. Musk replied, “Much appreciated,” thanking Vance for his support. EU Lawmakers defend legislations and fines While the criticism from the United States continues, European officials have defended the bloc’s strategy and insisted that strict regulation is necessary and justified. Bas Eickhout, co-chair of the Greens in the European Parliament, told POLITICO the Commission must enforce digital laws “with an iron fist” regardless of how loudly US officials protest. “They should just implement the law, which means they need to be tougher,” Eickhout said. He added that the EU should feel confident about its regulatory leadership, saying the bloc is “the only one fighting American Big Tech.” The Commission’s ruling is the first formal noncompliance decision issued under the Digital Services Act, a law that took effect shortly after Musk acquired Twitter in 2022.

Binance Alpha, the specialized on-chain trading service within the Binance ecosystem, has just made a significant move. The platform has announced the addition of the NIGHT token to its curated list. This development is a direct signal to investors looking for the next big opportunity before it hits mainstream exchanges. For those tracking Binance Alpha , this addition reinforces its core mission: to be your gateway to promising, early-stage digital assets. What is Binance Alpha and Why Does This Addition Matter? Think of Binance Alpha as a dedicated scout within the vast Binance universe. It operates inside the Binance Wallet, focusing exclusively on listing early-stage coins that have not yet achieved widespread recognition on major spot markets. Therefore, when Binance Alpha adds a token like NIGHT, it’s not a routine listing. It’s a curated selection based on the project’s potential for growth and innovation. This gives users a unique, on-chain avenue to discover and trade tokens much earlier in their lifecycle. How Does the NIGHT Listing Benefit Crypto Traders? The inclusion of NIGHT on Binance Alpha provides concrete advantages for informed traders. First, it offers early access . Users can engage with the token’s market dynamics sooner than the general public. Second, it involves on-chain trading , which can provide greater transparency into transactions and liquidity. However, it’s crucial to remember the inherent nature of the Binance Alpha platform. Early-stage investments come with higher volatility and risk. The potential for significant reward is matched by the possibility of substantial price swings. Engaging with platforms like Binance Alpha requires a specific mindset. It’s for those who do their own research (DYOR) and understand the landscape of new crypto projects. The service democratizes access to these nascent assets, but it does not guarantee success. Your strategy should account for the high-risk, high-reward profile typical of all early-stage coins. What Should You Do After This Binance Alpha Update? If the addition of NIGHT on Binance Alpha has caught your interest, a structured approach is key. Don’t rush into a trade based solely on the listing news. Begin by researching the NIGHT project itself. Look into its use case, development team, tokenomics, and long-term roadmap. Next, familiarize yourself with the mechanics of the Binance Alpha platform within the Binance Wallet. Understand how deposits, trades, and withdrawals work in this on-chain environment. Conduct Deep Research: Investigate the NIGHT project’s whitepaper and community channels. Assess Risk Tolerance: Only allocate funds you are prepared to lose entirely. Start Small: Consider a small initial position to gauge market behavior. Secure Your Assets: Ensure your Binance Wallet and private keys are securely managed. This proactive, research-driven method transforms you from a passive observer into an active, informed participant in the early-stage crypto space that Binance Alpha cultivates. Conclusion: Binance Alpha Sharpens Its Edge as a Discovery Hub The listing of NIGHT is more than just another token addition; it’s a testament to the evolving role of Binance Alpha . The platform is steadily building a reputation as a essential tool for crypto natives seeking alpha—market-beating returns found through early discovery. While the path is fraught with volatility, the opportunity to support and grow with innovative projects from their infancy is a powerful draw. As Binance Alpha continues to expand its portfolio, it solidifies its position at the intersection of discovery, innovation, and on-chain trading strategy. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) What exactly is Binance Alpha? Binance Alpha is an on-chain trading service integrated within the Binance Wallet. Its primary focus is listing and facilitating trade for early-stage cryptocurrency projects that are not yet available on Binance’s main spot exchange. Is the NIGHT token now available on the main Binance exchange? No. The listing of NIGHT is currently exclusive to the Binance Alpha platform. A listing on Binance Alpha does not guarantee a future listing on the main Binance spot market. Who should use the Binance Alpha platform? Binance Alpha is designed for experienced cryptocurrency traders and investors who understand the high risks associated with early-stage projects. It is not suitable for beginners or those with a low risk tolerance. How do I access Binance Alpha to trade NIGHT? You need to use the Binance Wallet (such as the Trust Wallet or Binance’s Web3 Wallet). Within the wallet’s interface, you can navigate to the Binance Alpha section to view available tokens like NIGHT and execute on-chain trades. Are tokens on Binance Alpha safe to invest in? While Binance curates the listings, all early-stage coins carry significant risk, including the potential for project failure, extreme volatility, and low liquidity. Investors must conduct thorough independent research before committing any funds. What are the advantages of on-chain trading on Binance Alpha? Key advantages include earlier access to new projects, the transparency of blockchain-based transactions, and direct interaction with the project’s native smart contracts and liquidity pools.

MEXC continues to safeguard core assets while providing a fully auditable view of user balances, reinforcing our unwavering commitment to 100% fully backed user fund safety. The report , completed on November 26, 2025, confirms that MEXC holds sufficient on-chain assets to fully cover all user liabilities, with coverage ratios for major assets — including BTC, ETH, USDT, and USDC — consistently exceeding 100%. According to the audit, Hacken conducted a comprehensive evaluation of MEXC’s reserves using industry-standard methodologies, including Proof of Liabilities, Proof of Ownership, reserve sufficiency calculations, and Merkle-tree verification. MEXC’s Proof of Reserves framework aggregates anonymized user balances and maps them to publicly verifiable on-chain holdings, enabling independent validation of solvency without compromising personal information. The auditor verified that MEXC maintains operational control over all wallets included in the assessment and confirmed that user balances are fully backed based on the assets reviewed. The examination covered a broad range of networks, with reserve wallets identified across Bitcoin, Ethereum, Solana, TON, Tron, BNB Chain, Arbitrum, Optimism, Avalanche-C, Base, Polygon, Aptos and Sui. The report also provides detailed breakdowns of wallet addresses, balances, and asset distribution. The final reserve ratio table confirms that each major asset class is supported by reserves exceeding its liabilities. Hacken reviewed outbound transactions from selected addresses as part of its Proof of Ownership procedures and validated the integrity of the Merkle-tree structure used to compute user liabilities. These transparency efforts are underpinned by MEXC’s continuously refreshed Proof of Reserves framework and an independently maintained protection system, giving users and counterparties verified confirmation of reserve coverage, strict asset segregation, and real-time fund accessibility. “At MEXC, we are fully committed to transparency and security, and this report once again demonstrates our unwavering dedication to 100% user fund safety,” said Vugar Usi, COO of MEXC. “Independent Proof of Reserves audits are now a continuous, core standard practice within our operational framework. We will continue working with established auditing firms such as Hacken to ensure our users have verifiable assurance that their assets are fully backed.” Hacken concludes that MEXC’s reserve structure demonstrates full solvency, including the accounting of off-exchange obligations. The report highlights the proper implementation of the PoR methodology, the quality of the supplied data, diversified asset holdings, and the exchange’s high level of responsibility toward its users. “We’ve seen increased transparency demand in the crypto industry over the past year, and the results of MEXC’s audit reflect this shift”, noted a spokesperson for Hacken. “Our audit confirmed that the exchange has sufficient asset reserves and a clear reserve management structure. In an environment where trust is built only through verifiable data, MEXC demonstrates its willingness to operate transparently and back up its commitments with facts, not words”. Hacken also emphasizes that the results serve as a “testament to the responsible financial management practices employed by MEXC, as well as the company’s dedication to transparency and accountability”. Regular Proof of Reserves audits remain central to MEXC’s long-term strategy to strengthen trust and elevate industry standards. As global demand for accountability and compliance in cryptocurrency trading grows, verified reserve transparency has become essential to build user confidence and demonstrate real financial resilience. The release of the latest independent audit by Hacken powerfully reinforces MEXC’s standing as a global benchmark for trust, transparency, and resilience—setting a gold standard for accountability in the worldwide crypto ecosystem.

55544741,https://timestabloid.com/?p=91772,1765274420,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/67/default.png,MUTM or SOL? What Is The Best Cryptocurrency To Invest Before The Next Bull Run Begins?,https://timestabloid.com/mutm-or-sol-what-is-the-best-cryptocurrency-to-invest-before/,"As the crypto market prepares for the next bull run, investors are looking beyond established Layer-1 tokens like Solana (SOL). Many are rotating capital into high-utility presale tokens that promise early entry at lower prices. These presales allow investors to access crypto coins with strong utility potential before the wider market discovers them. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has emerged as a leading candidate for the next crypto to explode. Its ongoing presale presents a rare opportunity for investors to secure tokens at attractive rates while the platform builds its ecosystem. Comparing MUTM and SOL across utility, adoption drivers, risk, and upside potential reveals why MUTM could be a strategic addition to forward-looking portfolios. Solana (SOL) Solana (SOL) currently trades around $125 while its price reflects demand driven by network throughput, decentralized application activity, and Layer-1 adoption. Historically, SOL benefits from network upgrades, expanding DeFi and NFT activity, and institutional flows. These factors support SOL’s market relevance but limit asymmetric upside compared to early-stage presale tokens like MUTM. As per the ongoing bearish cycle, unlike MUTM, SOL may face further decline in price. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is currently in presale Phase 6 with a total supply of 4B tokens. The Phase 6 price is $0.035, and 170M tokens have been allocated, already reaching 97% sold out. Across all phases, the presale has raised approximately $19.30 million and attracted over 18,400 holders. The next presale phase will raise the price to $0.040, a 15% increase. A recent update now allows MUTM tokens to be purchased by card with no limits. This improvement increases accessibility for investors and acts as a catalyst for growth, making participation in the presale easier and more convenient. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) will operate a dual lending structure designed for flexibility and security. The Peer-to-Contract (P2C) model pools user assets into audited smart contracts. Participants will receive mtTokens that reflect their share plus accrued interest. Interest rates will adjust with pool utilization, and overcollateralization alongside automated liquidation will protect the pools. The Peer-to-Peer (P2P) model allows direct lender–borrower agreements for riskier or less liquid tokens. Terms will be negotiated individually, and no shared liquidity exists. This isolates volatility from core pools while offering higher-yield bespoke loans. In essence, P2C provides shared automated liquidity, while P2P enables custom bilateral deals that isolate risk. This dual model positions MUTM to cater to both conservative and yield-seeking investors. V1 Protocol Launch and Upcoming Growth Drivers for MUTM Mutuum Finance (MUTM) shared on its official X account that the V1 version of its protocol is set to launch on the Sepolia Testnet in Q4 2025. This initial deployment will activate the protocol’s foundational elements, including the liquidity pool mechanism, the mtToken and debt token models, and an automated liquidator bot built to safeguard collateral and uphold system stability. During this phase, users will be able to lend, borrow, and leverage ETH or USDT as collateral. Releasing V1 on the testnet gives the community early hands-on access, allowing them to understand the protocol before the mainnet debut. This phased rollout enhances transparency, drives early participation, and equips the team with practical user feedback for refinements. As testnet activity grows, overall interest in the ecosystem may increase, reinforcing long-term confidence and strengthening demand for the MUTM token. It is expected that Mutuum Finance (MUTM) will synchronize its platform launch with token listing. This coordinated rollout will generate early momentum as traders and lenders will have a working product on day one. Unlike many presales that release tokens long before activity begins, MUTM will provide live lending and borrowing modules at launch. This approach will likely attract attention from Tier-1 and Tier-2 exchanges. Working products typically meet listing requirements faster. Visibility and trading volume are expected to rise sharply. Investors will be able to explore the platform, engage with dual lending, and stake mtTokens for rewards immediately, giving MUTM an intrinsic use case from the start. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) distinguishes itself from hype-driven meme tokens. Every platform feature, from lending to staking and buybacks, will generate demand for the token. The roadmap includes an over-collateralized stablecoin system. Users will mint a $1-pegged stablecoin by locking approved collateral such as ETH, SOL, or AVAX. Each mint or repayment will drive transactional activity, creating consistent on-chain demand. As the platform expands, MUTM’s utility will deepen across lending, borrowing, and staking. Continuous feature rollout will maintain organic demand long after the token lists. MUTM will implement a buy-and-distribute model that rewards users while supporting long-term price growth. Revenue from platform fees will be used to repurchase MUTM from the market and distribute tokens to stakers. This model creates dual benefits. Stakers will earn regular rewards, incentivizing long-term participation. Simultaneously, consistent buybacks will introduce positive price pressure in the open market. As platform activity grows, buybacks and distributions will increase, creating a cycle that reinforces token value. Phase 6 is already 97% sold out, and the next phase will raise the price by 15% to $0.040. Investors looking for sub-$0.04 exposure to a high-utility token before the next bull run will find this presale window highly attractive. If you want sub-$0.04 exposure before the next phase, act now — this window is closing.

55545160,642325,1765274425,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/55545160.jpeg,Wall Street Storms Ripple In Explosive $500 Million Deal,https://bitcoinist.com/wall-street-ripple-500-million-deal/,"Ripple has become the most aggressively structured bet in blue-chip crypto after a group of major Wall Street firms wired about $500 million into the company in November, lifting its valuation to roughly $40 billion and making it one of the highest-valued private players in the sector. Bloomberg reported that Ripple’s share sale brought in some of the biggest names of Wall Street but only after investors secured a suite of downside protections. Wall Street Goes All-In On Ripple The investor line-up reads like a who’s who of modern market structure: Citadel Securities, Fortress Investment Group, Marshall Wace, Brevan Howard–linked vehicles, Galaxy Digital and Pantera Capital all participated, treating the round at least as much as a structured credit trade as a venture bet. According to multiple accounts of the deal, several funds underwrote Ripple essentially as a concentrated exposure to XRP itself. Bloomberg’s reporting states that multiple investors concluded at least 90% of Ripple’s net asset value was tied to XRP, with the company controlling about $124 billion of the token at market prices in July. That XRP cushion has already been tested. XRP is down roughly 40% from its mid-July peak and about 15–16% since late October, yet even after that drawdown, estimates in deal coverage still put the company’s XRP treasury in the tens of billions of dollars, with a large portion locked in escrow and released gradually over time. The protection that Wall Street insisted on has become the defining feature of the deal. Investors secured the right to sell their shares back to Ripple after three or four years at a guaranteed 10% annualized return, unless the company has gone public by then. Ripple, conversely, can force a buyback in those same windows only by delivering about 25% annually. On top of that, the funds negotiated a liquidation preference, giving them priority over legacy shareholders in a sale or insolvency. The numbers involved are non-trivial. FinTech Weekly estimates that if the put option were exercised in full at the four-year mark, Ripple’s cash outlay would approach $700 million–$730 million, irrespective of operating performance or token prices at the time. Those obligations sit alongside an already heavy capital agenda: Ripple has agreed to buy prime-brokerage platform Hidden Road for roughly $1.3 billion and corporate-treasury specialist GTreasury for about $1 billion , while also confirming it has repurchased more than 25% of its outstanding shares. Banks and trading desks are now treating the November round as a new reference point for crypto credit risk. FinTech Weekly reports that “those terms are now shaping how banks, funds, and trading desks assess Ripple’s balance sheet, exit risk, and future liquidity,” with the three- and four-year exit windows being modeled explicitly alongside XRP price scenarios and rate curves. Ripple’s management maintains there is “no plan, no timeline” for an IPO , but the structure of the deal effectively date-stamps its private capital: either the company lists or finds new liquidity on favorable terms before the put windows open, or it must fund a secured, fixed-return exit for some of the most sophisticated players on Wall Street. At press time, XRP traded at $2.0498.",XRP|ripple|ripple news|wall street|XRP news|XRP price,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|MARKET|TRADING|XRP|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-12-09 10:00:25

The “Open Interest” refers to an indicator that measures the total amount of positions related to the asset that are currently open on all centralized derivatives platforms. Related Reading: This 11.7 Billion Dogecoin Wall Could Be Key Resistance For DOGE, Analyst Says When the value of the metric rises, it means the investors are opening new positions related to the asset. Generally, new positions come with fresh leverage for the sector, so the cryptocurrency’s price can become more volatile following an increase in the Open Interest. On the other hand, the indicator going down suggests the perpetual futures traders are either closing up position of their own volition or getting forcibly liquidated by their platform. Such a trend can lead to more stable price action for BTC due to the clearing of leverage. Now, here is the chart shared by CryptoVizArt.₿ that shows the trend in the Bitcoin perpetual futures Open Interest (BTC-denominated) over the last few months: As displayed in the above graph, the BTC-denominated Bitcoin perpetual futures Open Interest saw a sharp plunge back in October as a result of the crash in the cryptocurrency’s price. Following the leverage flush, the indicator traveled sideways around its lows, but in mid-November, speculation noted an uptick as the asset’s drawdown continued, with the metric’s value peaking alongside the level that has so far acted as the bottom. Since this high, however, the indicator has cooled off once again and approached the same lows as the ones that followed the massive liquidation event in October. Thus, with Open Interest back under 310,000 BTC, it seems speculative interest in the market has once again become muted. The recent decline in speculative participation has come alongside a drop in the perpetual futures Funding Rate, a metric tracking the amount of periodic fee being exchanged between the short and long investors. From the chart, it’s visible that the Bitcoin perpetual futures Funding Rate has been going down since a while now. “This persistent drift lower reflects a decline in leveraged long conviction, with traders unwilling to pay a premium to maintain upside exposure,” noted the Glassnode researcher.

Acting Chairman Caroline D. Pham announced the launch of a groundbreaking pilot program that allows certain digital assets, including Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), and Tether (USDC), to be used as collateral in derivatives markets. Therefore, this initiative signals a major evolution in how traditional finance can engage with cryptocurrencies while maintaining robust regulatory oversight. Alongside the pilot, the CFTC issued guidance on tokenized collateral and scrapped outdated rules under the GENIUS Act, modernizing regulations to boost clarity, innovation, and market integrity. Therefore, the launch of this pilot program marks a major step in integrating digital assets into regulated markets. Building on September’s tokenized collateral initiative, part of the CFTC’s broader ‘Crypto Sprint,’ it demonstrates a strategic balance between fostering innovation and managing risk, enabling market participants to safely explore new opportunities. By allowing digital assets to serve as collateral, the CFTC is linking traditional finance with the booming crypto ecosystem. This move could unlock derivatives markets for institutions previously wary of regulatory uncertainty, while the inclusion of stablecoins like USDC mitigates liquidity and volatility concerns, boosting market confidence. The initiative positions the U.S. as a global leader in regulated digital asset adoption, signaling that cryptocurrencies can be integrated securely and effectively into mainstream finance. Analysts believe such programs may drive broader institutional participation, accelerating the adoption of digital assets across the financial system. As the pilot program launches, market participants will closely monitor its impact and potential expansion. Acting Chairman Pham signals a decisive stance: the CFTC is driving digital asset innovation while upholding the safeguards essential for market stability and integrity. Harvard Bets Big on Bitcoin Over Gold Amid Dollar Debasement Concerns Harvard University is doubling down on Bitcoin, sharply increasing its holdings as a hedge against U.S. dollar debasement, signaling rising institutional confidence in the cryptocurrency, as showcased by Bitwise CIO Matt Hougan. In Q3, Harvard’s Bitcoin allocation nearly quadrupled to $443 million, outpacing its gold ETF exposure, which rose to $235 million. This 2-to-1 preference highlights the university’s strong conviction in Bitcoin’s long-term store-of-value potential over traditional safe havens. Hougan suggests that Harvard’s strategy reflects a broader shift among sophisticated investors, who increasingly see digital assets not as speculative bets but as effective hedges against inflation and currency debasement. Bitcoin’s fixed supply of 21 million coins contrasts sharply with fiat currencies like the U.S. dollar, which face ongoing inflation from expansive monetary policies. Harvard’s move marks a pivotal change in perception. While gold has long been the trusted inflation hedge, Bitcoin’s decentralized structure, finite supply, and growing adoption suggest it may offer superior protection in an era of currency devaluation. Well, Harvard’s decision sends ripples beyond academia. By allocating twice as much to Bitcoin as to gold, the prestigious university signals to institutional investors that digital assets can be central to diversified portfolios amid macroeconomic uncertainty. This bold move underscores a shift in institutional finance, positioning Bitcoin not as a peripheral play but as a key tool for long-term wealth preservation, and potentially setting a blueprint for other major institutions seeking alternatives to traditional inflation hedges. Conclusion The CFTC’s pilot program signals a turning point for digital assets, proving that cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum can integrate with regulated financial markets. By updating outdated rules and providing clear guidance on tokenized collateral, the commission is paving the way for wider institutional adoption and stronger market confidence. This initiative could reshape derivatives trading, ushering in an era where innovation and regulation advance together. On the other hand, Harvard’s bold pivot to Bitcoin over gold marks a turning point in institutional investing. By embracing digital assets amid fears of currency debasement, the university validates Bitcoin as a modern store of value and signals a shift in portfolio strategy. As other institutions follow suit, Bitcoin’s role in mainstream finance is set to grow, ushering in an era where cryptocurrency and traditional assets coexist as complementary hedges against economic uncertainty.",News|Bitcoin,EN,0,0,BTC|ETH|FIAT|MARKET|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-12-09 10:02:05

Key Takeaways: Libeara and FundBridge launched a tokenized gold fund that tracks gold’s spot price. The structure removes vaulting costs while keeping regulated, gold-linked exposure. The move expands Standard Chartered’s push into real-world asset tokenization. The fund, launched in partnership with FundBridge Capital, allows professional investors to gain exposure to gold through blockchain-based tokens issued on Libeara’s ledger. Each token is designed to correlate to the spot price of gold, offering a digitized alternative to holding the physical metal. FundBridge Says Tokenized Gold Cuts Costs While Preserving Price Exposure FundBridge said the structure removes the traditional costs of vaulting and logistics while keeping the price exposure intact. “FundBridge’s priority is to bridge traditional fund governance with emerging digital infrastructure,” CEO Sue Lynn Lim reportedly told Nikkie . “We’ve worked closely with our partners to ensure the framework meets the standards of a regulated fund environment while advancing the use of real-world assets on-chain.” The fund, named MG 999, is available exclusively to institutional and accredited participants. Unlike traditional gold funds, MG 999 does not hold physical bullion. Instead, the tokens are engineered to mirror gold’s market performance, offering a synthetic exposure mechanism that FundBridge says targets efficiency without compromising regulatory safeguards. 𝐔𝐒$𝟏 𝐁𝐢𝐥𝐥𝐢𝐨𝐧 in regulated assets, powered by Libeara ! We’re proud to announce that the total amount of tokenised assets powered by Libeara has officially surpassed US$1 Billion in AUM on https://t.co/ppI25aKcvh – https://t.co/G1b99JjJZC pic.twitter.com/Z1eLYXbkjZ — Libeara (@libeara_) November 26, 2025 The move extends a broader push by established financial institutions to tokenize real-world assets, bonds, funds, treasuries and now precious metals, as blockchain technology gains ground well beyond the volatile world of cryptocurrencies. SC Ventures has been steadily expanding its digital-assets footprint in Asia. Alongside Libeara, the bank holds majority stakes in Zodia Custody and Zodia Markets, both focused on institutional digital-asset services. The latest initiative underscores how traditional finance players are leveraging their reputation to enter a sector that has struggled with trust following multiple industry blowups. Gold Demand Surges as Institutions Seek Alternatives The launch also comes during a renewed surge in global gold demand. Central banks have been increasing their bullion reserves this year amid ongoing concerns about the long-term dominance of the US dollar and geopolitical uncertainty. President Donald Trump’s tariff policies have further stoked demand for safer assets. Last month, Standard Chartered joined other financial institutions in launching a physically backed gold fund in Singapore, with the bank acting as custodian for bullion stored at the high-security Le Freeport vault near Changi Airport. That product targets investors seeking exposure to allocated metal rather than tokenized units . MG 999 also contains a lending component aimed at Singapore’s jewelry sector. Mustafa Gold, a major retailer in the city-state, has been named the fund’s first borrower. The structure allows Mustafa to secure credit against its gold jewelry inventory while keeping the pieces on display. “Gold-linked tokens are quite unique and complex,” said Mustafa founder Mustaq Ahmad. “MG 999 lets retailers tap digital innovation and better manage working-capital needs.” The post Standard Chartered-Backed Libeara Launches Tokenized Gold Fund in Singapore appeared first on Cryptonews .",Blockchain News|Gold|Standard Chartered|Tokenization,EN,0,0,ASIA|BLOCKCHAIN|FIAT|TRADING|MACROECONOMICS,"{'name': 'cryptonews', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptonews.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptonews,2025-12-09 10:06:25

This deliberate pause gives competitor Metaplanet a clear runway to establish itself first. For investors watching the intersection of traditional finance and Bitcoin-centric corporations, this decision speaks volumes about market strategy and timing. What Exactly Is Perpetual Preferred Stock? Before diving into the strategy, let’s clarify the product. Perpetual preferred stock is a hybrid security. It functions like equity but pays regular dividends like a bond, with no set maturity date. Companies use it to raise capital without diluting common shares. MicroStrategy currently offers these products alongside digital credit in the U.S., creating a steady income stream for the company. According to Saylor’s comments at the Bitcoin MENA event, Japan already has five such products available. Metaplanet, a Japanese firm, is preparing to launch two more. By stepping back, MicroStrategy is avoiding immediate competition and allowing the local market to develop further. Why Would MicroStrategy Cede This Opportunity? This isn’t a retreat; it’s a calculated strategic delay. Saylor explicitly stated he is giving Metaplanet a “12-month window.” This suggests several potential motivations: Market Testing: Letting another firm launch first allows MicroStrategy to observe market reception and regulatory nuances in Japan without committing its own resources. Focus on Core Markets: The company may prioritize strengthening its U.S. offerings and Bitcoin acquisition strategy before expanding into new geographic territories. Strategic Partnership Potential: This move could be a gesture of goodwill, potentially paving the way for future collaboration or a less congestive market entry later. Essentially, MicroStrategy is trading short-term market share for long-term strategic intelligence and potentially smoother market entry. It’s a patient, chess-like move in a fast-paced industry. What Does This Mean for the Broader Crypto Market? This decision highlights a maturing sector where traditional corporate finance tactics are being applied to crypto-native strategies. The issuance of perpetual preferred stock is a sophisticated tool, and its geographic rollout is being managed with precision. It signals that leading Bitcoin corporations are thinking in multi-year strategic cycles, not just quarterly results. For investors, it underscores the importance of understanding the capital structure and funding strategies of companies like MicroStrategy. Their ability to raise non-dilutive capital through instruments like perpetual preferred stock directly fuels their ability to accumulate Bitcoin, a core part of their value proposition. A Compelling Summary of Strategic Patience Michael Saylor’s announcement is a masterclass in strategic patience. By temporarily forgoing the Japanese market for perpetual preferred stock , MicroStrategy gains valuable market data, avoids a crowded launch, and potentially builds strategic rapport. This one-year pause is not a sign of weakness but a confident, long-game play from one of the most influential figures in corporate Bitcoin adoption. It reminds us that in the high-stakes world of crypto finance, sometimes the most powerful move is the one you don’t make. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) What is perpetual preferred stock? It is a type of equity that pays fixed dividends indefinitely, with no maturity date. It sits between common stock and debt in a company’s capital structure. Why is MicroStrategy not issuing it in Japan? Michael Saylor stated the company plans to give Metaplanet a 12-month first-mover advantage in the Japanese market, suggesting a strategic delay rather than a lack of interest. Does MicroStrategy offer perpetual preferred stock elsewhere? Yes. The company currently issues perpetual preferred equity and digital credit products in the United States. What is Metaplanet? Metaplanet is a Japanese company preparing to launch two new perpetual preferred stock products, positioning itself as a first mover following MicroStrategy’s announced pause. How does this affect MicroStrategy’s Bitcoin strategy? Perpetual preferred stock is a tool for raising capital. The strategy for its issuance influences how the company funds its ongoing Bitcoin acquisition and treasury operations. Could MicroStrategy enter the Japanese market after one year? Saylor’s comments imply this is a temporary, 12-month pause, leaving the door open for a future entry once the market landscape is clearer.

The announcement comes amid an intensifying crackdown on unauthorized coin minting activities across the country, especially those relying on stolen electric power. Moscow goes after miners minting outside Russian law The executive power in Russia intends to impose criminal liability for illegal crypto mining as well as administrative liability for smaller violations of the legislation regulating the industry. The plan was made public by Russian Deputy Prime Minister Alexander Novak, who also unveiled the federal government is preparing harsher penalties for those who offer illegal lending services. Quoted by the RIA Novosti news agency on Monday, the high-ranking official reminded that Moscow now wants to comprehensively regulate the turnover of decentralized digital money in the country’s economy next year and elaborated: “We will legally regulate the issue of digital currency circulation, and also establish administrative liability for violations of legislation on digital currency mining and criminal liability for illegal mining.” “And we will tighten responsibility, up to and including criminal liability, for individuals illegally engaged in providing consumer loans,” Novak also said, speaking at a meeting of the Russian Federation’s Council for Strategic Development and National Projects. The move of the federal government follows Central Bank of Russia’s decision to oblige credit institutions to link bank accounts to personal tax numbers. This is necessary for the proper functioning of the so-called “Antidrop” platform, which the regulator aims to launch in 2027, explained the CBR’s Deputy Governor Olga Polyakova, quoted by the business news outlet RBC. The monetary authority wants to use the tax numbers to identify money mules, called “droppers” in Russian slang, who are exploited by fraudsters to launder illicit money. Funds stolen from victims are often converted to and from cryptocurrency, using bank cards and accounts registered under the names of such persons. Critics have long noticed that measures like that, including options to cap cash withdrawals at ATMs and block bank accounts in case of suspicious transactions, are not only targeting scammers, but also affecting crypto traders, particularly those participating in peer-to-peer exchange. Russia stepping up crackdown on illegal crypto mining Mining became Russia’s first regulated crypto activity with the adoption of dedicated legislation in 2024. The law allows legal entities, individual entrepreneurs as well as ordinary citizens to engage in what’s now a legitimate business activity. The first two categories are required to register with the Federal Tax Service (FNS) while the latter are free two mint digital coins without registration, as long as their electricity consumption remains under 6,000 kWh a month. However, less than a third of all mining enterprises have so far registered with the state, according to a recent estimate. And both licensed and unauthorized miners have been blamed for causing electricity shortages in places with high concentration of crypto farms. Local and federal authorities have temporarily or permanently banned the business in about a dozen regions, but Russians have kept mining, often on stolen power, defying the stringent restrictions, as recently reported by Cryptopolitan. That’s despite an intensifying crackdown on such operations, with joint raids conducted by employees of utility companies and police officers, already actively backed by agents of the Federal Security Service (FSB). Means employed in this struggle are becoming increasingly sophisticated. Investigators are now tracking energy consumption and internet traffic , with the help of smart electricity meters and Russian telecoms. They are even flying drones with thermal cameras to locate illegal crypto farms. At the same time, miners are becoming more inventive, too. It’s not uncommon for law enforcement to now find mobile mining farms, with the hardware installed in the back of cargo vehicles, or mining machines placed in abandoned industrial and farm buildings that still provide access to the grid.

Specifically, Shiba Inu has recorded its highest level of major investor activity in six months, with the network reporting 406 whale transactions within a day, according to Santiment data shared on December 9. Each transfer exceeded $100,000, marking the highest concentration of large movements since June 6. This spike coincided with a significant shift in exchange supply, as more than 1.06 trillion SHIB flowed onto centralized exchanges within 24 hours. Shiba Inu whale transaction chart. Source: Santiment Notably, the whale movement emerged amid SHIB’s price fluctuations, suggesting strategic positioning by large holders. Historically, such inflows to exchanges precede market volatility, and the current activity aligns with this trend. In the near term, SHIB’s price will depend on how whales use these deposited tokens. Large inflows typically increase downward pressure, as major holders may sell. At the same time, if these tokens hit the market, SHIB could experience a pullback or sharp intraday swings. However, if whales are positioning for buying or short-term liquidity, the activity could fuel a rebound or upside volatility. SHIB’s ecosystem trader participation Additional data from Santiment shows that trader participation in the SHIB ecosystem has escalated dramatically. The network’s aggregate trading volume across all exchange applications surged to $66.91 trillion on Sunday before stabilizing at $4.01 trillion on Tuesday. SHIB trader participation chart. Source: Santiment This is the highest sustained volume level since March 2024, signaling revived interest among market participants and deeper liquidity across the ecosystem. Such a spike typically reflects renewed confidence and an improved ability for large orders to be executed without destabilizing price, strengthening SHIB’s short-term bullish case. SHIB price analysis As of press time, SHIB was trading at $0.000008529, having gained about 0.4% in the past 24 hours. On the weekly timeline, the token has gained almost 8%.

Source: Finbold The current price position of Shiba Inu places it below both its 50-day simple moving average ( SMA ) of $0.00000928 and its 200-day SMA of $0.00001023, signaling a persistent short- to medium-term downtrend as the price lags these key support levels. Meanwhile, the 14-day Relative Strength Index ( RSI ) at 48.81 remains neutral, neither overbought nor deeply oversold, suggesting limited immediate momentum for a reversal but potential stabilization if buying pressure builds above the 50-day SMA.

Just two weeks after launch, its new crypto perpetual futures products are not just gaining traction—they’re reportedly attracting a fresh wave of institutional capital. According to SGX President Michael Syn, this isn’t just shifting existing money around; it’s bringing new liquidity into the ecosystem. Let’s explore why this development matters for the future of digital asset trading. What Makes SGX’s Crypto Perpetual Futures So Appealing? Unlike traditional futures with an expiry date, perpetual contracts, or ‘perps’, allow traders to hold positions indefinitely. SGX’s entry into this arena with Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) contracts fills a specific gap. President Syn highlighted a key driver: meeting institutional demand for basis trading during Asian market hours. Previously, traders might have relied on overseas exchanges or over-the-counter (OTC) desks, which can operate outside standard market hours. SGX provides a regulated, exchange-traded alternative right in the heart of the Asian timezone. The early data is promising. Trading volumes have surged since the debut, suggesting the product is hitting a nerve. More importantly, Syn emphasized this volume represents new liquidity . This means capital entering the crypto market that wasn’t there before, rather than simply being drained from other exchanges or products. For a market often scrutinized for its depth, this injection is a significant positive signal. How Does SGX Manage Risk Differently? One major concern with leveraged crypto products is risk management. High leverage can lead to rapid, automatic liquidations during volatile swings, especially in OTC or some decentralized finance (DeFi) settings. SGX is taking a notably conservative approach. The exchange implements a strict collateral policy designed to protect all parties involved. Conservative Margins: Higher initial margin requirements compared to some platforms. Robust Clearing: Trades are centrally cleared through SGX, adding a layer of security and counterparty risk management. Institutional Trust: This framework is built to foster trust with professional investors who prioritize stability alongside opportunity. This risk-averse model may appeal to institutions like hedge funds, family offices, and asset managers who are cautiously entering the crypto space. It offers exposure to crypto’s price movements within a familiar, regulated exchange environment. What’s Next for Institutional Crypto on SGX? Building liquidity and trust is the current primary goal, according to Syn. A liquid market ensures tight bid-ask spreads and efficient price discovery, making the product more useful for everyone. However, the roadmap looks beyond just BTC and ETH perpetuals. SGX has signaled potential future expansions, including: Options Contracts: Providing more sophisticated hedging and income strategies. Altcoin Futures: Expanding the product suite to include other major digital assets. More Integration: Further bridging traditional finance (TradFi) infrastructure with the digital asset world. This phased approach shows a clear understanding of the market. First, establish core products with strong risk controls. Then, once a foundation of liquidity and confidence is built, expand the offering to meet evolving institutional needs. Conclusion: A Bridge for Institutional Capital The successful early uptake of SGX’s crypto perpetual futures is more than a product launch story. It represents a meaningful step in the maturation of cryptocurrency markets. By providing a regulated, Asia-centric venue with prudent risk management, SGX is building a credible bridge for institutional capital. This move supports healthier market structure, enhances liquidity, and could pave the way for more traditional finance players to participate confidently in the digital asset revolution. The focus now is squarely on nurturing this new liquidity pool, which could become a cornerstone for Asia’s crypto trading landscape. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) What are crypto perpetual futures? Crypto perpetual futures are derivative contracts that allow traders to speculate on the future price of an asset like Bitcoin without an expiry date. They are settled periodically to track the spot price. Why is SGX’s entry significant? SGX is a major, globally recognized stock exchange. Its offering provides a regulated and trusted venue for institutions, particularly in Asia, to trade crypto derivatives, attracting new capital into the market. What is basis trading? Basis trading is a strategy that exploits the price difference (the ‘basis’) between a futures contract and the underlying spot price of the asset. SGX’s products cater to this demand during Asian hours. How does SGX’s risk management differ? SGX employs a conservative collateral and margin policy, unlike some platforms offering extremely high leverage. This reduces the risk of cascading liquidations and appeals to risk-conscious institutions. What assets are currently available? As of now, SGX offers perpetual futures contracts for Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH). The exchange has indicated plans to potentially add more assets like options or altcoin futures in the future. Who is the target user for these products? The primary target is institutional investors such as hedge funds, proprietary trading firms, and asset managers looking for regulated crypto exposure and arbitrage opportunities in the Asian timezone.

Some market participants are watching for a possible year-end rally, while others see signs of weakness. Key Resistance in Focus Crypto analyst Michaël van de Poppe says Bitcoin is still trading along a bullish path. He pointed to $91,892 as a level that needs to be cleared to maintain upward momentum. If that happens, the next major resistance is around $100,793. A move through this zone could open the way to $100,000 before the end of December. Van de Poppe said, “It’s all depending on the open in the US, if that’s going to be causing the standard correction, then it’s time to buy the dip.” He also flagged a rejection at $92,000, saying it “ doesn’t look great in the short-term ,” but left open the chance of a breakout. If the market fails to hold current levels, he expects a possible drop to between $78,000 and $82,000 before a rebound. Bitcoin (BTC) Price Chart 09.12. Source: Michaël van de Poppe/X Bitcoin has gained over 4% in the past week, despite a slight decline of 2% over the last 24 hours. Current price sits around $90,330, with volume above $43 billion. Fed Meeting Adds Uncertainty Attention is now on the Federal Reserve’s upcoming policy meeting on December 10. In a recent video, analyst Ali Martinez pointed out that Bitcoin has reacted negatively after most FOMC meetings this year. Out of seven meetings so far, six were followed by corrections, with only one short-lived rally in May. Market data shows expectations for a rate cut are high, with current projections at over 87%. Still, Fed Chair Jerome Powell may take a cautious stance. Van de Poppe warned , “I wouldn’t be surprised if… Powell says ‘I don’t know whether we’ll proceed with rate cuts’ and the market does a classic sell-off.” Traders are preparing for either outcome, with some anticipating a final move lower before a potential reversal into year-end. Bearish Flag Pattern Raises Doubts A chart shared by Ali suggests Bitcoin may be forming a bearish flag. If confirmed, this setup could lead to a move down toward $70,000. The pattern follows a sharp drop, with a consolidation phase forming below key resistance. A break below the lower trendline would suggest continued weakness. Meanwhile, other analysts are watching short-term structure. DamiDefi noted that Bitcoin remains under a downward trendline on the 4-hour chart. He said a breakout above $94,000 would confirm strength, but if recent lows are lost, further downside is likely. “Until $BTC clears this downtrend, you’re not buying a dip, you’re buying a downtrend,” he said. Although there is a conflict of opinion regarding the short-term direction, on-chain information indicates that Bitcoin is still moving out of centralized exchanges. The trend usually indicates a long-term holding nature and can decrease the selling pressure.

As the cycle of developments continues to align, and the next milestone of the roadmap nears, the topic of Mutuum Finance (MUTM) as a high-upside project in the next crypto cycle is being discussed. What is Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Building Mutuum Finance is developing a decentralized lending framework that can be used to facilitate lending and borrowing. The protocol utilizes two linked markets. Users are free to lend ETH or USDT and get mtTokens which increase in value as the borrowers pay off interest. Interest rates that are changed with liquidity interact with the borrowers. Borrowing remains less costly when liquidity is in good condition. Liquidity becomes tight which increases rates. The loan to value ratio helps in safe borrowing and some of the events that happen because of the weakness in collateral are called liquidation events. The token started its developing journey at the beginning of 2025 at $0.01. It is currently trading at $0.035 which is a 250% burst as the project picks-up. Mutuum Finance has collected a raised amount of $19.2M and attracted holders to the tune of 18,400 with over 810M tokens sold. All these indications have catapulted Mutuum Finance into further discussions of the potential best cryptos as traders look into structured projects that have greater upside potential. V1 Timeline and Security Measures It was confirmed by Mutuum Finance in its official X account that the V1 testnet will be launched in Q4 2025. V1 consists of the lending pool, mtTokens, debt tracking and the liquidation engine. indulgence in ETH and USDT will be enabled at launch. This could be the objective of the next phase of the project since it will allow the users to test the system in the conditions of actual borrowing. The confidence has also been strengthened due to security preparation. Mutuum Finance passed a CertiK audit with a 90/100 score in the Token Scan. The smart contracts are under review by Halborn Security , and a bounty is available in terms of a bug bounty, which is 50k dollars, to learn about problems early. Certain analysts who reviewed the lending model, mtToken growth and anticipated borrowing volume state that Mutuum Finance would be able to go by 5x to 7x upon activation of the protocol. Their perception is based on the organization that connects the use of tokens with platform demand. The Growth Engine after Launch One of the greatest capabilities of Mutuum Finance is the use of mtTokens. Their worth is boosted whenever borrowers make repayments in the form of interest. Even a user who lends out even $400 worth of ETH can watch the growth of the mtTokens as the protocol acquires users. This is the linkage of yield to actual use as opposed to using the sentiment. Another model employed in Mutuum Finance is buy and distribute. MUTM is purchased directly in the market by a share of platform revenue. Users who stake the mtTokens are given purchased tokens. This creates a stabilized purchasing push since the protocol expands. Analysts observe that the structure can drive MUTM with a 10x to 12x growth range within the next cycle in case of borrowing and the continual growth of staking of the stables with the help of the m tokens. Long-range Forecast Mutuum Finance plans to issue a USD-pegged stable borrower interest supported stablecoin. Stablecoins allow lending systems to scale since they enable the stable value and enable all lenders and borrowers to operate without volatility spikes. A robust stablecoin can develop as the foundation of a lending market. The protocol is also set to extend to a number of layer-2 networks. L2 implementation lowers the expenses and the processing speed. The chain of lending must be updated promptly on collateral and liquidation levels and interest rates. L2 support also increases the efficiency of the system as the user activity increases. The solution will be based on Chainlink as the main oracle provider, with other pricing layers. The lending platform should decide on the proper pricing, which stops the liquidation errors. Since the stablecoins strongly grow, L2 is projected to expand, as the lending model operates in full capacity, and some analyst estimates indicate that it could grow as much as 15x in the next few years until 2026 and 2027 in case of continuous adoption among people. Community and Phase 6 Acceleration Mutuum Finance (MUTM) knows how to stay consistently active daily with its 24-hours leaderboard, where the winner gets $500 worth of MUTM. The card payment support enables new users to easily board through as fast users. Allocation of Phase 6 is currently near completion, and the demand has increased as users take the opportunity to obtain the remaining tokens at the current price of $0.035 before the next price runs. A recent order in excess of 100K indicated that the drop in supply was expedited and the retail purchasers were more urgent. As audited contracts near and allotment is almost complete V1, Mutuum Finance is a growing viable trend, as one of the most promising new crypto-based tokens set to grow early.

On-chain analytics firm Santiment reported the move on X, highlighting a six-month chart of Shiba Inu’s price, exchange balances and large transfers. According to the firm, “Shiba Inu has seen the highest amount of whale transfers since June 6th today, happening in tandem with a +1.06T net change to the amount of SHIB on exchanges. The #24 market cap in crypto is likely to see high volatility in the coming days.” What Does This Mean For The Shiba Inu Price? The chart shows 406 individual transactions exceeding $100,000 in value within a single day, the highest reading since early June. The second-highest peak occurred during the October 10 market meltdown, when roughly 300 SHIB whales were active, and the third came in mid-July, as more than 280 whales executed transfers. Related Reading: Shibarium Hack Fallout: Shiba Inu Team Criticized For Not Reporting Breach These “whale” transfers represent activity from large holders, trading desks and liquidity providers whose moves can materially affect market liquidity and order-book depth. At the same time, Shiba Inu’s exchange supply has jumped. Santiment’s overlay of “Supply on Exchanges (SHIB)” reveals a clear, abrupt uptick, annotated as “1.06T More SHIB On Exchanges in 24 Hours.” This reflects a net inflow of around 1.06 trillion tokens into exchange wallets, meaning more SHIB is now sitting in venues where it can be traded immediately. In market-structure terms, the combination of record recent whale activity and a sharp rise in exchange balances creates conditions that often precede significant price swings. Moving coins from self-custody to exchanges does not guarantee that they will be sold, but it increases the portion of circulating supply that is “sale-ready” and able to hit the order books at short notice. Related Reading: Will The Shiba Inu Price Hit A New All-Time High In 2025? Machine Learning Algorithm Answers Whether that translates into an outright dump is not yet visible on-chain. The same footprint could reflect whales preparing to sell, to arbitrage across venues, to supply liquidity, or to rebalance positions in anticipation of broader market moves. Santiment itself stops short of a directional call, limiting its guidance to the expectation that the Shiba Inu token “is likely to see high volatility in the coming days.” For now, the data point is clear: Shiba Inu’s largest holders have become more active than at any time since early June, and over a trillion additional tokens have shifted onto exchanges in just 24 hours. The direction of the next major move will depend on how that newly mobile supply is deployed. At press time, SHIB traded at $0.00000859.

On Monday, a social media post suggested that BlackRock had submitted an S-1 registration for a staked version of the ASTER ETF. The news spread among crypto enthusiasts, traders, and key opinion leaders (KOLs), but Binance co-founder Changpeng Zhao clarified that the filing was a fabrication. “Fake. Even big KOLs get fooled once in a while. Aster doesn’t need these fake photoshopped pics to grow,” Zhao stated. The supposed BlackRock filing appeared on a post by journalist That Martini Guy B on X, which included an image of a document claiming to be filed with the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) on December 5, under the title: “iSHARES® STAKED ASTER TRUST ETF SPONSORED BY SHARES DELAWARE TRUST SPONSOR LLC.” Aster ETF rumors ensue for the second time This is not the first time ASTER has been caught in ETF-related speculation. In early October, posts on X claimed that Grayscale had filed an S-1 registration for an ASTER ETF. A formal filing could have allowed investors to access ASTER through a regulated fund and boosted the token’s credibility. UPDATE 🚨 BLACKROCK HAVE JUST FILED FOR A STAKED $ASTER ETF! pic.twitter.com/AEEL1Dhq7B — That Martini Guy ₿ (@MartiniGuyYT) December 9, 2025 After some members of the crypto community shared these rumors, ASTER trading volumes and its values ticked upwards as investors reacted to unverified information. It was all uncovered when users found the document with several inconsistencies, including a mishap on the date written as “20255,” a clear error that could not occur in a legitimate SEC document. A review of official SEC filings confirms there is no record of any S-1 registration for ASTER by Grayscale or BlackRock, and without formal paperwork, the rumors have been shunned as inaccurate. Grayscale has not made any public statements regarding an ASTER ETF since the fake news was shared, and has been focusing on other crypto trusts. Despite the lack of confirmation, many traders treated the rumor as an implicit endorsement of ASTER, resulting in a brief market surge. The token went up by over 15% to trade over $2.2, with 24-hour trading volumes climbing to $1.42 billion, according to CoinMarketCap. However, in BlackRock’s case, the rumors did not have a similar impact, as the token on the purported filing fell 3.94% to $0.937 in the past 24 hours, indicating that traders were skeptical about the news even before Zhao debunked the fake SEC filing. Aster community bashed for spreading rumors, token unlock continues A member of the ASTER development team has called out some members of the community for spreading false information about the coin, saying it was doing damage to the ecosystem’s growth. “Fake news is not how you build a truly loyal following / result; in the long term, neither a project nor a movement will benefit from hyped falsehoods,” the developer wrote, “Anyone sharing fake $ASTER ETF news, whether knowingly or ignorantly, is really not doing any good for the future of $ASTER. Take responsibility for what you share.” Away from ETF fake news, ASTER will be completing its Season 4 buyback program this Wednesday. The protocol allocated 60–90% of daily fees, approximately $4 million, to buybacks, but the token’s price dipped as traders sold the news after a 10% rally to $1.05 earlier in December. The DEX linear token unlock released $9.47 million worth of ASTER this week as part of a broader 30-day unlock schedule. The new supply entering relatively thin markets may have created downward price pressure, which could have led to ASTER’s 24-hour trading volume falling by about 41% to $216 million. The token’s struggles occur alongside broader challenges in decentralized exchange (DEX) tokens. Rival Hyperliquid’s total value locked (TVL) fell 30% monthly as the broader crypto market is struggling with price drops, and confidence in the DEX ecosystem is dwindling. According to Monday’s DEX volume data from DefiLlama, Lighter XYZ led with $7.24 billion, accounting for 25.72% of the total trading volume. Aster came second with $5.59 billion, while Hyperliquid was fifth with 8.22% of total decentralized market trading volume.

This development represents a significant step toward integrating traditional finance with blockchain technology, potentially transforming how digital transactions occur within the region’s growing economy. What Makes This Ringgit-Backed Stablecoin Different? Bullish Aim, the company behind this initiative, has introduced RMJDT on the Zetrix blockchain network. Unlike volatile cryptocurrencies, this ringgit-backed stablecoin maintains a 1:1 value with the Malaysian currency through reserves of actual ringgit and short-term government bonds. This backing mechanism provides crucial stability that could encourage broader adoption among businesses and consumers wary of cryptocurrency price swings. The launch comes at a pivotal moment when several Asian nations are exploring digital currency alternatives. Malaysia’s entry into this space with royal backing adds considerable legitimacy to the project. Moreover, the involvement of government bonds in the reserve structure creates a direct link between the stablecoin and national economic instruments. How Will This Stablecoin Impact Malaysian Finance? This innovative ringgit-backed stablecoin offers several potential benefits for Malaysia’s financial ecosystem: Reduced Transaction Costs: Cross-border payments could become faster and cheaper compared to traditional banking systems Financial Inclusion: Unbanked populations might access digital financial services more easily Trade Efficiency: Malaysian exporters and importers could settle international transactions more efficiently Monetary Policy Tool: The central bank could potentially use the stablecoin for innovative monetary approaches However, challenges remain. Regulatory frameworks must evolve to accommodate this new financial instrument properly. Public education about digital currencies will be essential for widespread adoption. Additionally, the stablecoin must prove its resilience during economic fluctuations to maintain trust. Why Does Royal Backing Matter for Crypto Adoption? The involvement of Malaysian royalty brings unique advantages to this ringgit-backed stablecoin initiative. First, it provides institutional credibility that many cryptocurrency projects lack. Second, it may facilitate smoother regulatory approvals and government cooperation. Third, royal endorsement could accelerate public acceptance in a market where traditional institutions still command significant trust. This development follows similar initiatives in other Asian nations, creating what appears to be a regional trend toward national digital currencies. Unlike China’s digital yuan, which is centrally controlled, Malaysia’s approach involves private enterprise with official backing—a potentially more flexible model that could appeal to other Southeast Asian economies. What’s Next for Malaysia’s Crypto Landscape? The successful implementation of this ringgit-backed stablecoin could trigger several developments. We might see increased blockchain integration in Malaysian banking systems, more cryptocurrency-friendly regulations, and potentially even other ASEAN nations following suit with their own national stablecoins. The Zetrix network, as the chosen platform, may experience increased adoption for other financial applications. For everyday Malaysians, the practical implications could include easier remittance receipt from abroad, more accessible digital savings options, and potentially new investment vehicles tied to the stablecoin ecosystem. Businesses might benefit from streamlined supply chain payments and reduced currency conversion costs in regional trade. In conclusion, the launch of Malaysia’s ringgit-backed stablecoin represents a sophisticated bridge between traditional finance and innovative blockchain technology. With royal backing and a transparent reserve structure, RMJDT has the potential to accelerate cryptocurrency adoption while maintaining the stability users need for everyday transactions. As this development unfolds, it will provide valuable insights into how national economies can integrate digital currencies without sacrificing monetary sovereignty or financial stability. Frequently Asked Questions What is a ringgit-backed stablecoin? A ringgit-backed stablecoin is a digital currency whose value is pegged 1:1 to the Malaysian ringgit, typically through reserves held in traditional currency and government bonds. Who can use the RMJDT stablecoin? While initially available on the Zetrix network, the stablecoin is designed for both individual and institutional users who need stable digital transactions involving Malaysian currency. How is this different from other stablecoins? Unlike globally-focused stablecoins, this is specifically designed for the Malaysian economy with reserves including government bonds and direct ringgit backing. Is the stablecoin regulated? As a new financial instrument, it will need to navigate Malaysia’s evolving regulatory framework for digital assets and cryptocurrencies. Can I convert RMJDT back to physical ringgit? The design includes redemption mechanisms, though specific conversion processes will depend on exchange platforms and regulatory guidelines. What are the main benefits for users? Users gain access to fast digital transactions with ringgit stability, potentially lower fees than traditional systems, and blockchain-based transaction transparency.

The EU announced the probe today to determine whether Google used third-party material without proper compensation, which is in breach of EU competition rules. The European Commission confirmed that it is investigating Google over allegations of unfair terms imposed on content creators, granting itself privileged access to material and placing other AI developers at a disadvantage. The probe will focus on Google’s AI Overviews, AI Mode, and generative AI services integrated into search results. Google faces up to 10% of its global revenue in fines if found liable The EU is concerned that Google may have used publisher content and YouTube uploads without offering fair compensation or providing a mechanism for publishers to opt out of its use. The probe will also examine whether Google’s AI-generated summaries, which appear above traditional search results, may have contributed to traffic declines on online news sites, raising concerns about market distortion. “AI is bringing remarkable innovation and many benefits for people and businesses across Europe, but this progress cannot come at the expense of the principles at the heart of our societies. We are investigating whether Google may have imposed unfair conditions on publishers and content creators, while disadvantaging competing AI developers.” -Teresa Ribera , EU Antitrust Chief Alphabet now faces potential fines of up to 10% of its global revenue if the EU regulators find that Google breached antitrust rules. The latest investigation into Google follows recent complaints filed by independent publishers who alleged that the search engine giant was using online creators’ content without consent or payment. The EU has also recently fined Elon Musk’s X platform $140 million for transparency violations related to advertising and the use of the blue checkmark design. The fine attracted criticism across the industry, with U.S. President Donald Trump warning that Europe is going in the wrong direction following the fine. The president described the penalty as ‘nasty’, showing disapproval of the EU’s regulatory approach. Meanwhile, the EU has also launched a probe into Meta over its WhatsApp policies that limit AI provider access. According to a Reuters report , the European Commission stated that it will investigate Meta’s new policy, which would limit AI providers’ access to WhatsApp, in order to boost its own AI system that was integrated into the platform earlier this year. According to Teresa Ribera, the crackdown aims to prevent large firms from abusing their power to cut out innovative competitors, adding that interim measures may be imposed to block Meta’s new WhatsApp AI policy rollout. Google Overviews linked to traffic declines on competitor sites Google Overviews and AI Mode services are currently deployed in more than 100 countries, providing users with AI-generated summaries of web content. The search engine giant began integrating ads in AI Overviews in May 2025, which generates additional revenue for the firm. Independent publishers and other critics argue that such services, despite offering value to users, may unfairly exploit publisher content and prevent competitors’ AI innovations from reaching the market. The European Commission regulators will determine whether the search engine giant violated antitrust rules and abused its dominant position. The regulators will also determine if publishers cannot opt out or receive fair compensation for content used to train AI models. According to a Cryptopolitan report , the search engine giant was recently fined $3.4 billion in September relating to its dominance in online advertising. So far, Google has proposed technical resolutions to address the penalty but has declined calls from the EU to restructure the company. According to the EU, the probe marks a reflection of its commitment to ensuring fair compensation and protecting online content creators in the evolving AI market. If the regulators find Google liable, the firm may face operational restrictions and be required to adjust how its AI services access and use third-party content.

The cryptocurrency world witnessed one of its most dramatic collapses in 2022 when the original Terra Luna ecosystem imploded, wiping out billions in market value. Now, as LUNA 2.0 emerges from the ashes, investors are asking a crucial question: Can this revived token achieve what many thought impossible? Our comprehensive Terra Luna price prediction for 2025 through 2030 examines whether LUNA 2.0 can hit the psychologically significant $1 mark and what factors will determine its fate in the volatile crypto markets. Understanding the LUNA 2.0 Resurrection Story Following the catastrophic collapse of the original Terra ecosystem in May 2022, which saw LUNA’s value plummet from over $100 to fractions of a cent, the community voted for a hard fork. This created LUNA 2.0, a new blockchain that abandoned the failed algorithmic stablecoin model while preserving the developer community and some core infrastructure. The rebirth represents one of the most ambitious recovery attempts in cryptocurrency history, making any Terra Luna price prediction particularly challenging yet fascinating. Current Market Position and Technical Analysis As of late 2024, LUNA 2.0 trades significantly below its post-launch highs, reflecting both the ongoing skepticism and the broader cryptocurrency market conditions. Technical indicators present a mixed picture: Support and Resistance Levels: Key support has formed around $0.35, while resistance sits at $0.65-$0.70 Moving Averages: The 50-day and 200-day moving averages show consolidation patterns Trading Volume: Moderate but consistent, suggesting dedicated community participation Market Cap Ranking: Currently outside the top 100 cryptocurrencies by market capitalization Terra Luna Price Prediction 2025: The $1 Question Our 2025 Terra Luna price prediction hinges on several critical factors. Reaching $1 would represent approximately a 200-300% increase from current levels, depending on entry points. The probability rests on three pillars: Factor Positive Scenario Negative Scenario Adoption Growth New dApps and protocols rebuild utility Developer exodus continues Market Sentiment Broader crypto bull market returns Regulatory pressures increase Technical Development Successful upgrades and partnerships Technical challenges persist In a bullish cryptocurrency forecast scenario where the broader market recovers strongly and LUNA 2.0 demonstrates meaningful adoption, the $1 target becomes plausible by late 2025. However, this requires overcoming significant psychological resistance levels and rebuilding trust that was shattered during the collapse. LUNA 2.0 Price Trajectory: 2026-2030 Long-Term Outlook Looking beyond 2025, our extended cryptocurrency forecast considers several potential pathways for LUNA 2.0: 2026: Range of $0.80-$1.50, assuming steady blockchain recovery and moderate adoption 2027: Potential breakout to $2.00-$3.00 if ecosystem development accelerates 2028-2030: Speculative range of $3.00-$8.00 in optimal conditions, though significant volatility expected These projections assume that LUNA 2.0 successfully differentiates itself from its predecessor’s failure and carves out a sustainable niche in the competitive blockchain landscape. The long-term success depends heavily on whether the project can attract both developers and users who see value in the revived ecosystem. Key Factors Influencing the Cryptocurrency Forecast Several elements will determine whether our Terra Luna price prediction proves accurate: Ecosystem Development: The growth of decentralized applications (dApps) on the Terra 2.0 blockchain Market Conditions: Overall cryptocurrency market trends and Bitcoin’s performance Regulatory Environment: How global regulators approach revived projects with troubled histories Community Support: Continued engagement from the dedicated Terra community Technical Innovation: Unique features that differentiate LUNA 2.0 from other layer-1 blockchains Risks and Challenges in Blockchain Recovery Any analysis of LUNA 2.0 must acknowledge the substantial risks involved in blockchain recovery efforts: Reputation Damage: The shadow of the 2022 collapse continues to affect investor perception Competition: Intense competition from established and emerging layer-1 solutions Tokenomics: Concerns about inflation and distribution in the new token model Adoption Hurdles: Convincing users and developers to trust a previously failed ecosystem Comparative Analysis with Other Revival Stories History offers few direct comparisons to LUNA 2.0’s situation, but examining other cryptocurrency recovery attempts provides context. Projects that survived major setbacks typically required: Clear differentiation from their failed predecessors Strong community commitment through difficult periods Technical improvements addressing previous weaknesses Favorable market conditions during recovery phases LUNA 2.0 appears to be following a similar path, though the scale of the original collapse creates unique challenges. Expert Opinions and Market Sentiment Crypto market analysis from various experts reveals divided opinions on LUNA 2.0’s prospects. Some analysts point to the dedicated community and continued development as positive signs, while others remain skeptical about any project attempting to recover from such a catastrophic failure. This divergence of opinion contributes to the token’s volatility and makes price predictions particularly challenging. Actionable Insights for Investors For those considering LUNA 2.0 as part of their portfolio, several strategies may prove effective: Dollar-Cost Averaging: Given the volatility, regular small investments may reduce timing risk Portfolio Allocation: Treat as a high-risk, high-potential-reward allocation (typically 1-5% of crypto portfolio) Monitoring Metrics: Track developer activity, transaction volume, and partnership announcements Exit Strategy: Establish clear profit-taking and loss-limitation points before investing FAQs About Terra Luna Price Prediction What caused the original Terra Luna collapse? The collapse resulted from the failure of the algorithmic stablecoin UST (TerraUSD), which lost its peg to the US dollar, triggering a death spiral that devastated both UST and its sister token LUNA. The crisis highlighted fundamental flaws in algorithmic stablecoin design during market stress. How is LUNA 2.0 different from the original LUNA? LUNA 2.0 abandoned the algorithmic stablecoin model entirely, focusing instead on building a general-purpose blockchain. The new chain distributed tokens to affected community members while attempting to preserve developer tools and infrastructure. Who leads the Terra Luna development now? Do Kwon , the original founder, faces legal challenges, while community developers and the Terraform Labs team continue development. The project has shifted toward more decentralized governance following the collapse. What are the main use cases for LUNA 2.0? The token serves as the native cryptocurrency for the Terra 2.0 blockchain, used for transaction fees, staking, and governance. The ecosystem aims to support various decentralized applications across DeFi, NFTs, and other sectors. How does regulatory scrutiny affect LUNA 2.0’s prospects? Increased regulatory attention on algorithmic stablecoins and the original collapse creates ongoing challenges. However, by distancing itself from the stablecoin model, LUNA 2.0 may face different regulatory considerations than its predecessor. Conclusion: The Path Forward for LUNA 2.0 The journey toward $1 for LUNA 2.0 represents more than just a price target—it symbolizes the possibility of redemption in the cryptocurrency space. Our Terra Luna price prediction suggests that while the path will be challenging, with significant volatility and uncertainty, the $1 milestone by 2025 remains within the realm of possibility under favorable conditions. Success will require not just favorable market conditions but genuine technological innovation and community rebuilding. As with any cryptocurrency investment, particularly one with such a dramatic history, careful research, risk management, and realistic expectations remain essential for anyone considering exposure to this unique blockchain recovery story.

In a decisive move to cement its position as a leading Ethereum scaling solution, Polygon has successfully implemented the Madhugiri hard fork. This isn’t just a routine update; it’s a targeted enhancement designed to supercharge the network’s core performance. For developers and users, the Polygon Madhugiri hard fork translates to faster transactions, lower costs, and a more robust foundation for the next generation of decentralized applications. What Exactly is the Polygon Madhugiri Hard Fork? Think of a hard fork as a major software upgrade for a blockchain. It introduces new rules that all participants must follow, creating a definitive improvement in the network’s protocol. The Polygon Madhugiri hard fork is precisely that—a coordinated upgrade focused on one primary goal: raw efficiency. By optimizing how the network processes information and reaches consensus, Polygon is tackling scalability head-on to better serve its growing ecosystem. How Does the Madhugiri Upgrade Boost Polygon’s Performance? The technical improvements baked into this fork deliver tangible benefits. Let’s break down the key enhancements: 33% Increase in Throughput: The network can now handle significantly more transactions per second, easing congestion and supporting larger-scale applications. One-Second Block Time: Consensus time has been slashed to just one second. This means faster transaction finality and a much snappier user experience. Gas Fee Consumption Limit: A new cap on gas usage per block prevents any single transaction from overwhelming the network, ensuring smoother and more predictable operations for everyone. These changes work in concert. The faster block time and increased throughput mean the chain processes data more rapidly, while the gas limit acts as a stabilizer. The result is a leaner, more responsive Polygon Madhugiri hard fork -enhanced network. Why is This Upgrade Crucial for Real-World Assets (RWA) and Stablecoins? This is where the strategic vision becomes clear. Beyond raw speed, the Polygon Madhugiri hard fork is about building infrastructure for serious financial applications. Real-World Asset tokenization—representing things like real estate or commodities on-chain—requires a network that is not only fast but also extremely reliable and cost-effective. Similarly, stablecoin transactions demand high throughput and low latency to be viable for everyday payments. By dramatically improving efficiency and predictability, Polygon is directly addressing the core requirements of these use cases. The upgrade makes the network a more compelling and trustworthy layer for institutions and developers looking to bridge traditional finance with blockchain technology. What Does the Madhugiri Hard Fork Mean for the Future of Polygon? The successful implementation of the Polygon Madhugiri hard fork is a strong signal of the project’s execution capability and its roadmap priorities. It demonstrates a commitment to continuous, non-disruptive improvement. For the ecosystem, this means a more scalable and developer-friendly environment. For the broader blockchain space, it highlights the intense focus on solving practical scalability issues to enable mass adoption. In essence, this upgrade isn’t just a technical milestone; it’s a foundational step. It strengthens Polygon’s utility as a platform for complex, high-value decentralized applications, positioning it for the next phase of growth in the evolving Web3 landscape.

On-chain data reveals an address linked to the Ethereum Foundation moved 5,748 ETH, worth approximately $17.89 million, to the Kraken exchange. This substantial deposit immediately raises critical questions about market intentions and potential implications for Ethereum ‘s price trajectory. Let’s decode what this move could signal. What Does the Ethereum Foundation’s Kraken Deposit Mean? According to analytics from Lookonchain, the anonymous address ‘0x9D1c’ executed this multi-million dollar transfer. The firm’s tracking suggests the address originates from the Ethereum Foundation , the non-profit organization dedicated to supporting the Ethereum ecosystem. While the Foundation’s exact motives are not public, such a large movement of funds to an exchange typically indicates one of a few possibilities: Liquidity for Operational Expenses: The Foundation may need to convert ETH to fiat currency to fund grants, payroll, or development initiatives. Strategic Treasury Management: This could be part of a broader portfolio rebalancing or diversification strategy. Market Preparation: It might signal preparation for a future announcement or initiative requiring significant capital. However, the immediate market perception often interprets large exchange deposits as a potential precursor to selling, which can influence short-term sentiment. How Do Major Moves Impact Ethereum’s Market Sentiment? The Ethereum Foundation is not just any holder; it’s a foundational pillar of the network. Its actions are scrutinized because they can reflect insider confidence or strategic shifts. Therefore, a deposit of this magnitude acts as a powerful market signal, whether intended or not. Traders and analysts watch these flows closely for clues. Historically, large transfers from known entity wallets to exchanges have sometimes preceded price volatility. The logic is straightforward: exchange deposits increase the readily available supply for trading. If a large portion is sold, it can create downward pressure. Conversely, if the market absorbs the move without a major dip, it can demonstrate underlying strength. The key question for investors is: does this represent a strategic deployment of capital or a simple liquidity event? Should Investors Be Concerned About Ethereum’s Price? While eye-catching, a single transaction should not dictate a long-term investment thesis. The Ethereum Foundation holds a significant treasury, and routine asset management is expected. Here are three actionable insights for investors: Context is Crucial: Monitor if this is part of a series of withdrawals or an isolated event. Consistent outflows would tell a different story than a one-off transfer. Watch the Order Books: See if the deposited ETH is quickly sold on Kraken’s order books or if it remains dormant. On-chain tools can help track this. Focus on Fundamentals: Ethereum’s long-term value is driven by network adoption, developer activity, and upcoming upgrades, not single transactions. Therefore, this event is more a point of short-term speculation than a fundamental red flag. The true health of Ethereum is measured in its utility and ecosystem growth. Conclusion: Deciphering the Signal from the Noise The $17.89 million Ethereum Foundation deposit to Kraken is a significant on-chain event that rightly captures attention. It highlights the transparent yet complex nature of blockchain markets, where every major move is public. While it may stir short-term speculation, informed investors should view it through a wider lens. The Foundation’s ongoing commitment to development, coupled with Ethereum’s robust use cases, remains the core narrative. This transaction serves as a timely reminder to prioritize network fundamentals over noise and to use on-chain data as one tool among many in a comprehensive market analysis strategy. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What is the Ethereum Foundation? A1: The Ethereum Foundation is a non-profit organization established to support the Ethereum protocol and its ecosystem. It funds research, development, and education but does not control the network. Q2: Why would the Ethereum Foundation send ETH to an exchange? A2: Common reasons include converting ETH to fiat to cover operational expenses (salaries, grants), managing its treasury, or preparing funds for specific ecosystem initiatives. Q3: Does this mean the Ethereum Foundation is selling its ETH? A3: Not necessarily. Depositing to an exchange is the first step to potentially selling, but the funds could also be used for other purposes. The transaction itself does not confirm a sale has occurred. Q4: How can I track such large transactions myself? A4: You can use blockchain explorers like Etherscan or analytics platforms like Lookonchain and Nansen to monitor whale wallets and track large transfers in real-time. Q5: Should I sell my ETH because of this news? A5: Making investment decisions based on a single transaction is not advisable. Always consider your long-term strategy, risk tolerance, and the broader fundamental outlook for Ethereum. Q6: Has the Ethereum Foundation done this before? A6: Yes, the Foundation and other large entities periodically move funds for treasury management. It’s a normal part of operations for an organization of its scale. Found this analysis insightful?

Nobody Believed It Until It’s Too Late,https://timestabloid.com/xrp-history-is-repeating-nobody-believed-it-until-its-too-late/,"History often whispers before it roars. Market cycles return with familiar rhythms , yet most traders ignore these signals until momentum becomes undeniable. XRP now sits in a moment that feels eerily familiar to seasoned analysts. The structure, sentiment, and technical landscape echo a period that reshaped the asset’s trajectory eight years ago. This resemblance has placed XRP back at the center of the market conversation. Steph Is Crypto drew widespread attention to this unfolding parallel when he highlighted XRP’s repeating historical pattern. His observation ignited fresh debates across X, especially among traders who lived through the explosive 2017 surge. Since then, the discussion has shifted from vague speculation to detailed technical comparisons supported by current market data. The Re-Emerging Fractal Pattern XRP’s multi-week chart now mirrors the 2017 accumulation phase with striking accuracy . The structure features a prolonged compression, rising volume pockets, and consistently higher lows. $XRP HISTORY IS REPEATING. AND JUST LIKE 2017, NOBODY BELIEVES IT UNTIL IT’S TOO LATE! pic.twitter.com/zeNq3eMXrI — STEPH IS CRYPTO (@Steph_iscrypto) December 8, 2025 These features appeared just before XRP’s historic breakout in 2017. Analysts note that the current setup carries the same characteristics, suggesting a similar breakout could be forming. The pattern does not guarantee a rally, but it provides a strong technical foundation for bullish expectations. Institutional Demand Strengthens the Setup One major difference between 2017 and today is the presence of institutional capital. The launch of U.S. XRP ETFs has brought steady inflows for several consecutive weeks . These inflows have now strengthened the asset’s liquidity profile and increased confidence in the long-term narrative. ETF demand offers real-time confirmation of growing institutional interest, which did not exist in any meaningful way during the 2017 cycle. The Regulatory Climate Has Shifted Regulation once created uncertainty around XRP. Those concerns dominated headlines for years. Now the climate has changed. The long-running legal battle between Ripple and U.S. regulators has concluded , providing clarity for institutions that previously stayed away. This shift removes a major barrier that suppressed momentum during earlier cycles. Traders now believe the asset is positioned for a cleaner and more stable growth path. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Market Structure Supports a Breakout Scenario XRP continues to test critical resistance levels. The asset has also maintained key support zones despite broader market volatility. Sustained demand, rising trading volume, and improving sentiment reinforce the strength of the underlying structure. Traders now expect a decisive break above the compression zone. If the breakout occurs, price discovery could accelerate rapidly, as it did during the 2017 run. Why Many Still Doubt the Pattern Skepticism remains widespread because XRP’s past cycles created high expectations. Many traders now remain cautious, believing a repeat of the 2017 surge is unlikely. Yet this disbelief matches the mood that dominated the market shortly before the previous breakout. That emotional symmetry reinforces the idea that history may be repeating more closely than many expect. Final Thoughts The evidence suggests XRP is re-entering a historical rhythm. Technical patterns, institutional demand, and regulatory clarity now align in a way not seen since 2017. Steph’s observation captured a moment that traders may later view as a turning point. Whether the market listens now or waits until the move becomes obvious will determine who benefits most from the unfolding cycle.

With institutional adoption accelerating and global economic factors creating perfect conditions for digital assets, understanding Bitcoin price prediction models has become essential for anyone serious about cryptocurrency investment. This comprehensive analysis examines expert forecasts, market indicators, and technological developments to provide a clear picture of Bitcoin’s potential trajectory from 2025 through 2030. What Factors Influence Bitcoin Price Prediction Accuracy? Creating reliable Bitcoin price prediction models requires analyzing multiple interconnected factors. The cryptocurrency market operates differently from traditional financial markets, with unique drivers that can significantly impact BTC price movements. Understanding these elements is crucial for evaluating any Bitcoin 2030 forecast with proper context. Key factors include: Halving cycles : Bitcoin’s programmed supply reductions historically trigger bull markets Institutional adoption : Growing corporate and government interest increases legitimacy Regulatory developments : Global cryptocurrency regulations shape market accessibility Macroeconomic conditions : Inflation, interest rates, and currency devaluation drive demand Technological advancements : Layer 2 solutions and scalability improvements enhance utility Bitcoin Price Prediction 2025: The Post-Halving Surge The 2024 Bitcoin halving event sets the stage for significant price appreciation in 2025. Historical patterns suggest that the most substantial gains typically occur 12-18 months after halving events. When examining Bitcoin price prediction models for 2025, analysts consider both technical indicators and fundamental developments in the cryptocurrency market. Analyst/Institution 2025 BTC Price Prediction Key Rationale Standard Chartered $200,000 ETF inflows and institutional adoption Bloomberg Intelligence $100,000 – $150,000 Historical halving cycle patterns ARK Invest $150,000+ Network fundamentals and adoption curves These Bitcoin price prediction figures reflect growing consensus that 2025 could see BTC price reach unprecedented levels. The combination of reduced new supply from halving and increasing demand from institutional investors creates a powerful upward pressure scenario. BTC Price 2026: Consolidation or Continued Growth? Following potential 2025 peaks, the 2026 outlook presents interesting questions for cryptocurrency market analysis. Historical patterns show that Bitcoin typically experiences consolidation periods after major bull runs. However, fundamental developments may support continued growth rather than traditional corrections. Several factors could influence BTC price in 2026: Integration of Bitcoin into traditional financial systems >li>Expansion of Bitcoin-based financial products Potential regulatory clarity in major economies Technological improvements to Bitcoin’s infrastructure Most Bitcoin investment strategy experts recommend viewing potential 2026 corrections as accumulation opportunities rather than reasons for concern. The long-term trajectory remains positive according to most cryptocurrency market analysis models. Bitcoin 2030 Forecast: The Long-Term Vision Looking further ahead, Bitcoin 2030 forecast models become increasingly speculative but reveal fascinating possibilities. By 2030, Bitcoin will have experienced two additional halving events, further reducing new supply while adoption potentially reaches mainstream levels. Long-term Bitcoin price prediction models often compare Bitcoin to other store-of-value assets to estimate potential market capitalization. Consider these perspective-shifting comparisons: Gold’s current market cap: Approximately $14 trillion Global real estate value: Over $300 trillion Current Bitcoin market cap: Approximately $1.3 trillion If Bitcoin captures even a small percentage of these traditional asset markets, the BTC price implications are staggering. Conservative Bitcoin 2030 forecast models suggest prices between $500,000 and $1,000,000, while more optimistic projections extend into the multi-million dollar range per Bitcoin. Cryptocurrency Market Analysis: Beyond Price Numbers Effective cryptocurrency market analysis requires looking beyond simple price charts. The underlying health of the Bitcoin network, adoption metrics, and technological developments provide crucial context for any Bitcoin price prediction. These fundamental indicators often provide more reliable long-term signals than short-term price movements. Key metrics to monitor include: Network hash rate : Measures security and miner commitment Active addresses : Indicates genuine user adoption HODLer behavior Shows long-term investor confidence Exchange flows : Reveals accumulation versus distribution patterns Institutional holdings : Tracks corporate and fund adoption This comprehensive cryptocurrency market analysis approach helps separate signal from noise in volatile market conditions. It provides the foundation for developing a robust Bitcoin investment strategy rather than reacting to short-term price fluctuations. Developing Your Bitcoin Investment Strategy Based on these Bitcoin price prediction models, what practical Bitcoin investment strategy should investors consider? The most successful approaches balance long-term conviction with risk management principles. Rather than attempting to time perfect entries and exits, strategic accumulation during market weakness combined with long-term holding has historically produced excellent results. Essential elements of a sound Bitcoin investment strategy: Dollar-cost averaging : Regular purchases regardless of short-term price Secure storage : Self-custody solutions for significant holdings Portfolio allocation : Bitcoin as a percentage of overall investments Rebalancing rules : Guidelines for taking profits or adding positions Continuous education : Staying informed about technological developments Remember that any Bitcoin investment strategy should align with your risk tolerance, time horizon, and financial goals. Bitcoin’s volatility makes it unsuitable for short-term needs or emergency funds, but its potential as a long-term store of value continues to attract serious investors. Frequently Asked Questions What is the most reliable Bitcoin price prediction method? No single method guarantees accuracy, but combining stock-to-flow models, network fundamentals analysis, and historical cycle patterns provides the most comprehensive approach. Analysts like PlanB gained attention for stock-to-flow models, while institutions like Bloomberg Intelligence combine multiple methodologies. How does Bitcoin halving affect price predictions? Bitcoin halving reduces the new supply entering the market by 50% approximately every four years. This programmed scarcity, combined with steady or increasing demand, creates upward price pressure. Historical data from CoinMarketCap shows significant price appreciation following previous halvings in 2012, 2016, and 2020. Which companies are most influential for Bitcoin adoption? Several major corporations significantly impact Bitcoin adoption. MicroStrategy holds Bitcoin as a primary treasury asset, while Tesla has both invested in and accepted Bitcoin. Financial institutions like Fidelity offer Bitcoin investment products to clients. What role do governments play in Bitcoin’s future price? Government regulations and adoption significantly influence Bitcoin’s trajectory. Countries like El Salvador have made Bitcoin legal tender, while regulatory clarity in major economies like the United States through agencies like the SEC affects institutional participation. How should beginners approach Bitcoin investment? Beginners should start with education from reliable sources, begin with small amounts they can afford to lose, use reputable exchanges like Coinbase , and prioritize secure storage. Understanding Bitcoin’s volatility and long-term nature is crucial before investing significant funds. Conclusion: The Compelling Case for Bitcoin’s Future Bitcoin price prediction models from 2025 through 2030 paint a remarkably consistent picture of growth potential. While exact numbers vary between analysts, the directional consensus is overwhelmingly positive. The combination of Bitcoin’s programmed scarcity, growing institutional adoption, and macroeconomic trends favoring hard assets creates a powerful investment thesis. As global financial systems continue evolving, Bitcoin’s role as digital gold appears increasingly secure. The journey will undoubtedly include volatility, but the long-term trajectory suggests that today’s prices may represent significant value from a multi-year perspective. The most important Bitcoin investment strategy remains education, secure storage, and maintaining a long-term perspective through market cycles.

55549851,https://cryptonews.com/?p=461543,1765282283,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/52/55549851.jpeg,Privacy Coin Zcash Exposed – Half of All Transactions Now Tracked,https://cryptonews.com/news/privacy-coin-zcash-exposed-half-of-all-transactions-now-tracked/,"Blockchain intelligence firm Arkham announced on Tuesday that it has labeled over 53% of Zcash transactions, linking approximately $420 billion in volume to identifiable individuals and institutions, despite Zcash’s reputation as a privacy-focused cryptocurrency. The platform’s new tracking capability covers both shielded and transparent transactions, with 48% of transaction inputs and outputs and 37% of total balances, roughly $2.5 billion, now attributed to specific entities. ZCASH IS LIVE ON ARKHAM Arkham has now labeled more than half of the privacy chain Zcash’s shielded and unshielded transactions. This accounts for $420B of volume tagged to known individuals and institutions. Track $ZEC transactions, entities and balances on Arkham. Here’s what… pic.twitter.com/TOVJtr7kbl — Arkham (@arkham) December 8, 2025 The disclosure sparked immediate controversy within the crypto community, with critics accusing Arkham of making misleading claims about its ability to track truly private transactions. Zcash founder Zooko Wilcox clarified that the firm “ didn’t actually deanonymize any ZEC that was held at rest in the shielded pool, ” noting such tracking would be “ impossible because the information just isn’t there. “ Tracking Claims Draws Sharp Industry Backlash Blockchain developers quickly challenged Arkham’s announcement, pointing out fundamental limitations in tracking shielded Zcash transactions. Multiple industry figures noted that Arkham can only trace transparent-to-transparent, shielded-to-transparent, and transparent-to-shielded movements. At the same time, fully shielded transactions remain cryptographically protected through zero-knowledge proofs that make deanonymization technically impossible. Mert from Helius Labs called the announcement a “ scummy clickbait title ,” arguing Arkham deliberately included references to shielded transactions “f or a few clicks ” despite being unable to track them. He added that “ for a data org, that’s as scammy as it gets ” and suggested the move prioritized “ clicks over truth ,” potentially damaging the firm’s credibility in blockchain analytics. Saad El Kouari from AWB noted that the platform failed to identify major holders, including Grayscale, Electric Coin Company, and Shielded Labs, suggesting that its tracking capabilities remain limited to transparent wallet activity. He emphasized that Arkham “ can’t identify a single whale ” and “ 0 individuals, not even very clear targets ” like Wilcox himself, demonstrating the significant gaps in the firm’s surveillance reach. Dynamic Fee Proposal Addresses Network Congestion Beyond the privacy debate, Zcash developers advanced a separate initiative to overhaul the network’s fee structure. Shielded Labs released a detailed blueprint Monday proposing a shift from static fees, originally 10,000 zatoshi, later reduced to 1,000, to a dynamic model based on median transaction activity across 50-block periods. The proposal addresses recurring “sandblasting” spam episodes that previously clogged wallets and congested the chain under fixed-fee structures. An earlier ZIP-317 proposal introduced action-based accounting, treating every transaction component as a uniform “action,” fixing abuse vectors while maintaining predictable, low fees that don’t adjust to network usage. https://t.co/x2nHCOXHHP — (@shieldedmark) December 8, 2025 Developers emphasized that with ZEC’s recent price surge and increasing institutional interest, the current system has become unsustainable. Some users have reported edge cases where shielding small transactions costs double-digit ZEC amounts. The dynamic fee mechanism introduces a stateless design using “comparables” to establish standard fees while maintaining privacy protections. Under network stress, a temporary priority lane at 10× the standard fee would allow users to compete for block space without requiring protocol redesign or risking the complexity of EIP-1559-style mechanisms that could compromise Zcash’s privacy constraints. Institutional Adoption Drives Token Performance ZEC surged nearly 5% today, trading above $400 and vastly outperforming the broader market. Source: TradingView Last month, Zcash received significant institutional validation. The Winklevoss twins’ treasury vehicle has acquired 200,000 ZEC since November, worth over $80 million, targeting eventual ownership of roughly 5% of the circulating supply. Similarly, Reliance Global recently liquidated all other digital asset positions to focus exclusively on Zcash. Grayscale also filed with regulators to convert its existing Zcash Trust into a spot ETF tracking the CoinDesk Price Index, potentially opening new access channels for institutional investors.

While prices climbed, a key metric for retail participation has collapsed. Daily Bitcoin deposits from everyday investors into the giant exchange Binance have plummeted to a record low, averaging a mere 411 BTC. This isn’t a minor dip; it’s a fundamental change in how people choose to invest in crypto. The primary driver? The seismic arrival of spot Bitcoin ETFs . What Do the Record-Low Bitcoin Deposits Actually Mean? Data from analytics firm CryptoQuant reveals a dramatic structural decline. To understand the scale, compare today’s 411 BTC average to December 2021, when daily retail deposits on Binance neared 2,675 BTC. This drop of over 80% signals a massive behavioral shift. Therefore, the record-breaking price is not being fueled by the same type of retail frenzy we’ve seen in past cycles. Instead, a new, more accessible gateway has opened. How Are Bitcoin ETFs Changing the Game for Retail Investors? The launch of U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs in January 2024 provided a legitimate, familiar, and easier path for individual investors. Think about the benefits: Simplicity: Buy through a traditional brokerage account, just like a stock. Familiarity: No need to manage private keys or navigate crypto exchanges. Regulatory Comfort: Held within a regulated framework investors already trust. Consequently, money that might have flowed into Binance to buy Bitcoin directly is now likely flowing into these ETF products. This represents a monumental step for mainstream adoption, but it also redirects liquidity away from centralized exchanges. If Retail Is Leaving, Who Is Buying Bitcoin? Here’s the fascinating twist. While retail deposits dwindle, large-scale “whale” investors are sending a different signal. CryptoQuant’s analysis notes these entities are actively accumulating spot positions or taking long futures positions. This whale activity amidst retail hesitation often suggests that a potential price bottom or a period of consolidation is forming. The market is becoming more institutional, even as it becomes more accessible to the mainstream through new vehicles. What Does This Mean for the Future of Crypto Exchanges? This trend presents both a challenge and an opportunity for exchanges like Binance. The era of relying heavily on retail deposit volumes for dominance may be evolving. However, the underlying demand for Bitcoin exposure is stronger than ever—it’s just the channel that’s changing. Exchanges must now innovate, potentially focusing on services for sophisticated traders, staking, or bridging the gap between ETF products and the broader crypto ecosystem. In summary, the record-low retail Bitcoin deposits on Binance are not a sign of declining interest, but of a maturing market. The approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs has successfully onboarded a wave of new investors through a traditional door, fundamentally altering market dynamics. The baton is being passed, in part, from the retail exchange user to the ETF buyer and the accumulating whale, painting a new and complex picture of this bull run. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q: Are low retail deposits on Binance bad for Bitcoin’s price? A: Not necessarily. The price is now supported by massive inflows into Bitcoin ETFs and accumulation by large holders, which can provide more stable, long-term support. Q: Should I sell my Bitcoin on an exchange and buy an ETF instead? A: It depends on your goals. ETFs offer convenience and tax advantages in regular accounts but you don’t own the actual Bitcoin. Holding Bitcoin directly on an exchange or in a wallet suits those who want to use it in DeFi or for transactions. Q: Does this mean Binance is in trouble? A> Binance remains a giant with vast liquidity and services. This trend pressures one revenue stream but pushes exchanges to adapt and diversify their offerings beyond simple spot trading. Q: How can I track these kinds of market shifts myself? A> Follow on-chain analytics platforms like CryptoQuant or Glassnode, which provide data on exchange flows, whale wallets, and ETF holdings to see where the smart money is moving. Q: Will this trend continue? A> It’s likely. As Bitcoin ETFs become more entrenched and possibly expand to other regions, they will continue to be the preferred entry point for a large segment of new, traditional investors. Q: What’s the key takeaway for a regular crypto investor? A> Understand that the market structure is evolving. Major news like ETF approvals can redirect investment flows in unexpected ways, impacting different parts of the ecosystem differently.

This is the first time a homegrown crypto trading platform has sought a public listing. A First for Hong Kong According to the prospectus, HashKey is offering 240.57 million shares in its global sale, with just over 24 million reserved for Hong Kong buyers and the remainder for overseas participants. Applications opened on Tuesday and will run until noon on December 12, and the final offer price will be set for release on December 16. Trading on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange is scheduled to begin the following day under the ticker 3887. The filing details how the company intends to deploy the capital raised, setting aside roughly 40% of net proceeds for new product development and upgrades to trading infrastructure over the next three to five years. Another 40% will fund market expansion and new partnerships across its broader ecosystem. The remaining funds, meanwhile, are allocated equally between operations such as risk management and general corporate use. Although HashKey has remained in the red since 2022, the prospectus shows narrowing losses. The company recorded a HK$506.7 million deficit in the first half of 2025 compared with HK$772.6 million a year earlier. Revenue for the nine months ended September 30 rose 4% to HK$557.6 million, driven mainly by gains in its asset management division despite a 24% decline in trading activity. The company said the losses indicate the heavy upfront investment required to scale a licensed and compliant crypto platform. The documents also offer new insight into HashKey’s expanding footprint in trading, custody, and tokenization. Broader Regulatory Landscape The IPO comes as Hong Kong strengthens its standing as a regulated hub for digital assets, following two years of new policies in a bid to draw licensed operators. In April, regulators approved staking services for SFC-supervised firms, followed by tighter safeguards for custodial operations. Hong Kong’s SFC also approved ChinaAMC’s spot Solana ETF in October, in the region’s first SOL ETF. In a separate development, HashKey recently joined Binance and other major crypto firms in pledging a combined HK$57 million ($7.3 million) to support relief efforts after the devastating Level 5 residential fire in Hong Kong’s Tai Po. The funds will help equip local relief teams and provide assistance to families impacted by the deadliest residential fire in more than a decade.

It currently stands at $3.17 trillion. 86 of the top 100 coins have gone down over the past 24 hours. At the same time, the total crypto trading volume is at $116 billion. TLDR: Crypto market cap decreased by 1.2% on Tuesday morning (UTC); 86 of the top 100 coins and all top 10 coins have gone down today; BTC decreased by 1.1% to $90,480, and ETH is down by 0.3% to $3,122; The US Federal Reserve is expected to cut interest rate on Wednesday; ‘All eyes are on Bitcoin’s $91,000 resistance level’; Official announcement of Kevin Hassett as the next Fed Chair should be bullish for crypto in 2026; The US CFTC launched a pilot where crypto serves as collateral in derivatives markets; US BTC spot ETFs saw inflows of $54.79 million on Friday, and ETH spot ETFs recorded $75.21 million in outflows; Michael Saylor’s company Strategy purchased additional 10,624 BTC; Crypto market sentiment remains largely the same within the fear category. Crypto Winners & Losers At the time of writing, all top 10 coins per market capitalization have seen their prices decrease over the past 24 hours. Bitcoin (BTC) is down by 1.1% since this time yesterday, currently trading at $90,480. Bitcoin (BTC) 24h 7d 30d 1y All time Ethereum (ETH) is down by 0.3%, meaning that it’s practically unchanged, now changing hands at $3,122. This is the category’s smallest drop. The highest fall among the ten is 2.1% by Tron (TRX) , currently trading at $0.2811. Solana (SOL)’s 1.9% is behind it, now standing at $133. Looking at the top 100 coins, 86 have dropped over the past day. At the red top we find Hyperliquid (HYPE) , which fell 6.1% to the price of $28.2. It’s followed by Internet Computer (ICP)’s 4.7% to $3.37. The two best performers yesterday are also the two best performers today. Zcash (ZEC) saw a 12.8% increase to the price of $419. Canton (CC) is up 9.8%, now changing hands at $0.07446. Traders are focused on the US Federal Reserve and the speed at which it will cut rates following the expected announcement, set for this week. That said, many argue that the cut is priced in. Meanwhile, the US Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) has launched a pilot that lets Bitcoin, Ether, and USDC serve as collateral in derivatives markets. . @CFTCpham Announces Launch of Digital Assets Pilot Program for Tokenized Collateral in Derivatives Markets: https://t.co/okRaxM9aQ9 — CFTC (@CFTC) December 8, 2025 $91,000 Resistance Level Aurelie Barthere, Principal Research Analyst at Nansen , commented that “all eyes are on Bitcoin’s $91,000 resistance level.” This is where the 20-day EMA meets the downward trend from last October. “Following the FOMC+ meeting, I expect BTC to hover around this level without a decisive break,” the analyst says. Nansen expects a rate cut, which is already priced into markets, and guidance from the Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell emphasizing a data-dependent path forward. “With a two-month lag in labor-market data, the Fed is likely to maintain a wait-and-see stance,” Barthere says. “In the Summary of Economic Projections, I’m expecting the terminal rate to hold near 3.0%, reflecting a Committee still divided between hawks and doves.” Barthere concludes that “looking ahead to early 2026, the official announcement of Kevin Hassett as the next Fed Chair should be bullish for crypto, and it’s notable that this decision, originally expected this year, has been delayed.” Levels & Events to Watch Next At the time of writing on Tuesday morning, BTC stood at $90,480. There was a notable plunge earlier in the day from the intraday high of $92,203 to the low of $89,735. It then recorded another smaller peak at $91,353 before pulling back to the current price. BTC is still green in the 7-day time frame, having appreciated 4.1% and moving between $86,418 and $93,855. A drop below $85,000 could lead to the $78,000 which would open doors for further decreases. However, if BTC recovers above $95,000 and then $102,000, it could proceed to the $108,000 level. Bitcoin Price Chart. Source: TradingView Ethereum is currently changing hands at $3,122. It saw a lot choppier trading day than BTC. It decreased from the day’s high of $3,171 to the low of $3,093, the level it hit twice today. Over the past week, ETH has outperformed BTC again, having increased by 11.3%. It traded in the $2,796–$3,222 range. If it continues falling, the price could retreat below $3,000 and towards $2,850. On the other hand, if it reclaims the $3,300 level, it may keep rising to $3,450 and $3,560. Ethereum (ETH) 24h 7d 30d 1y All time Meanwhile, the crypto market saw a minor increase on Tuesday morning, staying within the fear territory. The crypto fear and greed index rose to 25 today compared to 24 yesterday. That said, it’s been moving in a tight range over the past 30 days, occasionally dropping into the extreme fear zone.

Hyperscale Data has announced plans to dramatically expand its internal Bitcoin investment fund to a staggering $75 million. This decision highlights a pivotal trend: major corporations are not just watching crypto—they are actively building substantial positions. Let’s explore what this means for the market and why this fund expansion is a landmark event. What is the Hyperscale Data Bitcoin Investment Fund? Hyperscale Data, trading under the ticker GPUS on the NYSE, is not a typical crypto startup. It’s an established public company making a strategic, corporate-level commitment to Bitcoin. The company’s current Bitcoin investment fund , managed through its subsidiary Sentinum, already holds approximately 452 BTC. The new plan is to grow this dedicated capital pool to $75 million. To put this in perspective, this planned investment represents about 83% of the company’s total market capitalization. This is a profound allocation, showing immense confidence in Bitcoin’s long-term value proposition. Why is This Fund Expansion So Significant? This move goes beyond a simple purchase. It represents a structured, formal approach to cryptocurrency by a mainstream, regulated entity. Here are the key implications: Institutional Validation: A NYSE-listed company allocating such a large portion of its value to Bitcoin sends a strong signal of legitimacy to other traditional investors. Strategic Treasury Management: Companies like Hyperscale Data are increasingly viewing Bitcoin as a viable treasury reserve asset, similar to gold, to hedge against inflation and currency devaluation. Market Impact: The announcement includes an immediate $34 million in cash earmarked for buying more BTC on the open market. This creates direct, tangible buying pressure. Therefore, this expansion of their Bitcoin investment fund is a blueprint other public companies may follow. How Does This Bitcoin Investment Fund Work? Understanding the structure is crucial. The fund is an internal corporate initiative, not a public offering for external investors. Hyperscale Data allocates its own capital to acquire and hold Bitcoin as a core part of its business strategy. The subsidiary, Sentinum, manages these holdings. This model allows the company to gain direct exposure to Bitcoin’s potential appreciation while maintaining operational control. It’s a hands-on approach to crypto investing that contrasts with simply buying a Bitcoin ETF. What Are the Potential Challenges? While bold, this strategy is not without risks. Bitcoin’s price is famously volatile. A significant downturn could negatively impact the company’s balance sheet in the short term. Furthermore, the regulatory environment for corporate holdings of digital assets is still evolving. Hyperscale Data must navigate accounting standards, custody security, and potential regulatory scrutiny. However, their public listing suggests they are prepared to meet these compliance challenges head-on, setting a precedent for transparency in corporate crypto holdings. What’s the Future of Corporate Bitcoin Funds? Hyperscale Data’s aggressive expansion could be a catalyst. As more companies witness this confident move, we may see a wave of similar announcements. The success of this Bitcoin investment fund could encourage other firms to diversify their treasuries beyond traditional bonds and cash. The playbook is being written: establish a dedicated fund, partner with secure custody solutions, and hold for the long term. This trend has the potential to fundamentally change how institutional capital flows into the cryptocurrency ecosystem. In conclusion, Hyperscale Data’s plan to boost its Bitcoin investment fund to $75 million is a watershed moment. It demonstrates that for forward-thinking institutions, Bitcoin is transitioning from a speculative novelty to a serious component of strategic finance. This move provides not just capital but crucial credibility, potentially paving the way for broader corporate adoption and solidifying Bitcoin’s role in the future of global assets. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What is Hyperscale Data’s ticker symbol? A1: Hyperscale Data trades on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker symbol GPUS . Q2: How much Bitcoin does Hyperscale Data currently own? A2: Through its subsidiary Sentinum, the company currently holds approximately 451.85 BTC . Q3: Is the $75M fund for public investment? A3: No. This is an internal corporate Bitcoin investment fund . Hyperscale Data is using its own capital to purchase and hold Bitcoin as part of its corporate strategy. Q4: What does this mean for Bitcoin’s price? A4: While one company’s actions don’t dictate the market, large, public commitments like this create buying pressure and enhance institutional credibility, which are generally positive long-term factors for Bitcoin’s adoption and value. Q5: Are other public companies doing this? A5: Yes, companies like MicroStrategy have pioneered this strategy. Hyperscale Data’s move adds to a growing trend of public firms adding Bitcoin to their balance sheets. Q6: What are the risks for Hyperscale Data? A6: The primary risks are Bitcoin’s price volatility, which affects their holdings’ value, and the evolving regulatory landscape for corporate cryptocurrency ownership.

Source: TradingView The Relative Strength Index (RSI) is trending in the neutral region. The indicator’s value was recorded at 39.76 today. The downward curve on the RSI signifies a bearish trend. However, instability can be expected if the selling momentum intensifies and the indicator’s score decreases further. Uniswap price analysis on the 4-hour chart The four-hour chart analysis of Uniswap also shows the return of selling pressure, as the price levels are decreasing again. This is evidenced by its price plummeting to $5.47 over the past four hours; it may decrease further in the coming hours if traders continue selling more. Moreover, decreasing volatility signifies a lower chance of a reversal or higher price oscillation. The Bollinger Bands are covering less area, leading to a low level of volatility. This low volatility signals greater market predictability. The upper Bollinger Band has shifted to $5.69, indicating the resistance point. Conversely, the lower Bollinger Band has moved to $5.42, establishing the support point. UNI/USD 4-hour price chart.

Unlike traditional exchanges, Uniswap uses an automated market-matching (AMM) system. Uniswap has shown good performance over time and is expected to reach the $22.26 level by 2027 and above $45.69 by 2031. Why is UNI down? The broader crypto market is experiencing negative market sentiment today. Most of the top cryptocurrencies are shedding, and so is UNI. How much will Uniswap be worth in 2025? The maximum UNI can reach in 2025 is $10.54, while the average price is expected to be around $8.79. Will UNI reach $20? Uniswap is trading just below the $6 range, down from $18.59, which it achieved in December last year. The current resistance levels are $6.27 and $7.8; a break above them can lead to $11. If UNI gets more support, $20 can be achieved by the year 2027, which is quite higher than its current value, making it a good option to buy UNI tokens. Will UNI reach $50? In May 2021, UNI touched $44.9, its all-time high, which is not much below $50. This possibility can arise again if the broader cryptocurrency market turns bullish on political and economic factors. However, this is not investment advice, and one should seek independent professional consultation before making any investment decision. Can Uniswap reach $100 dollars? According to the Uniswap price prediction, UNI is not expected to reach near $100 by the last quarter of 2031. Though this is a five-year time frame, it’s worth waiting, as the coin’s value will increase but may not reach $100. Does UNI have a good long-term Future? UNI is the token of the famous Uniswap decentralized exchange. It has a wide user base and good liquidity, so the coin has good prospects. Market analysts expect UNI’s price to reach $45.69 by the end of 2031, substantially higher than its current price.

This bold statement, reported by Solid Intel, raises critical questions about the future of U.S. monetary policy and its profound impact on everything from your savings account to the volatile world of cryptocurrency. What does this political pressure mean for the independence of the most powerful financial institution in the world? What Does Trump Want from the Next Federal Reserve Chair? According to the report, Trump’s primary requirement for the next head of the Federal Reserve is a commitment to lower interest rates. This stance is not new for Trump, who frequently criticized the Fed during his presidency for not cutting rates aggressively enough. However, framing it as an “essential requirement” for the next chair signals a more direct and confrontational approach to influencing monetary policy. The Federal Reserve Chair is traditionally expected to operate independently from political pressure to ensure economic decisions are based on data, not politics. Why Are Interest Rate Cuts So Crucial? Interest rates are the Federal Reserve’s most powerful tool. Here’s a simple breakdown of what rate cuts typically aim to do: Stimulate Borrowing: Lower rates make loans cheaper for businesses and individuals. Boost Spending: With lower savings returns, people may be incentivized to spend or invest. Weaken the Dollar: This can make U.S. exports more competitive globally. Therefore, demanding cuts suggests a priority on stimulating economic growth, potentially at the risk of higher inflation. For markets, especially crypto, the anticipation of cheaper money has historically been a major catalyst for price increases. The High-Stakes Clash Over Federal Reserve Independence The core issue here transcends a simple policy preference. It strikes at the heart of the Federal Reserve’s independence. A Federal Reserve Chair who feels obligated to fulfill a political promise risks losing credibility. Markets thrive on predictability and trust in institutional stability. If investors believe monetary policy is being set by the White House rather than economic indicators, it could lead to severe volatility and long-term damage to the U.S. dollar’s status. Moreover, the timing is critical. The next president will likely appoint a new Federal Reserve Chair when Jerome Powell’s term ends. Trump’s pre-emptive demand sets the stage for a major political battle over who controls the economic levers of the nation. What This Means for Cryptocurrency Investors For the crypto market, the implications of this demand are significant. Cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin have often been viewed as a hedge against loose monetary policy and a weakening dollar. Here’s the potential impact: Potential Bullish Signal: Aggressive rate cuts could flood the economy with cheap money, some of which may flow into riskier assets like crypto, seeking higher returns. Inflation Fears: If rate cuts spur runaway inflation, hard assets with limited supply, including Bitcoin, could see increased demand. Increased Volatility: Any perception of political meddling at the Fed could spook traditional markets, causing ripple effects of instability in crypto markets. Therefore, the debate over the next Federal Reserve Chair is not just a political story—it’s a financial one that every investor should watch closely. Conclusion: A Defining Moment for Monetary Policy Donald Trump’s declaration to demand rate cuts from the next Federal Reserve Chair highlights a pivotal tension in modern economics: political influence versus institutional independence. The outcome of this stance could redefine the Fed’s role for a generation. For everyday Americans and global investors alike, the choice of the next Federal Reserve Chair will be one of the most consequential economic decisions of the coming years, directly influencing inflation, employment, and the strength of your investments in both traditional and digital assets. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: Can a President legally demand specific actions from the Federal Reserve Chair? A: While the President appoints the Fed Chair, the Federal Reserve is designed to be an independent agency. A President can express preferences, but legally demanding specific policy actions like rate cuts undermines the Fed’s operational independence established by Congress. Q2: How does the Federal Reserve Chair influence cryptocurrency prices? A: The Fed Chair controls interest rate policy. Lower rates tend to weaken the U.S. dollar and increase liquidity, which has historically been a positive environment for risk-on assets like cryptocurrencies, as investors seek higher yields. Q3: Who is the current Federal Reserve Chair? A> Jerome Powell is the current Chair of the Federal Reserve. His term is set to end, and the next U.S. President will have the opportunity to nominate his successor, subject to Senate confirmation. Q4: Why is Fed independence considered so important? A: Independence allows the Fed to make politically difficult but economically necessary decisions—like raising rates to fight inflation—without fear of short-term political backlash. This stability is crucial for long-term economic health and global confidence in the U.S. dollar. Q5: What happens if the Fed cuts rates too aggressively? A: Overly aggressive rate cuts can overheat the economy, leading to high inflation. It can also create asset bubbles in markets like stocks and real estate, and reduce the Fed’s ability to combat a future economic downturn. Q6: When will the next Federal Reserve Chair be appointed? A: The next major opportunity for a new appointment will be when Chair Powell’s term ends. The timing coincides with presidential election cycles, making it a recurring topic of political debate.

Will XRP finally break free from its legal shackles and surge to new heights? As one of the most debated cryptocurrencies, Ripple’s XRP has captured investor attention with its unique position in cross-border payments and its ongoing battle with regulators. This comprehensive analysis explores whether XRP can reach the elusive $5 milestone by examining market trends, adoption metrics, and the critical legal landscape that could make or break its future. Ripple XRP Price Prediction: The Current Landscape XRP occupies a unique position in the cryptocurrency ecosystem. Unlike Bitcoin’s store-of-value narrative or Ethereum’s smart contract platform, XRP focuses on revolutionizing cross-border payments through Ripple’s payment solutions. The current price reflects years of regulatory uncertainty, particularly the SEC lawsuit that began in December 2020. Despite this, XRP maintains strong institutional partnerships and real-world utility that could drive future growth. XRP Price 2025: The Post-Legal Clarity Scenario 2025 represents a crucial year for XRP’s trajectory. Most analysts agree that the resolution of regulatory issues will be the primary price driver. Here’s what different scenarios could mean for XRP price 2025: Scenario Price Range Key Drivers Favorable Legal Outcome $2.50 – $4.00 Clear regulatory framework, increased institutional adoption Mixed Legal Outcome $1.20 – $2.00 Partial clarity, continued adoption but with limitations Unfavorable Legal Outcome $0.40 – $1.00 Restricted US operations, reduced institutional interest Several factors will influence XRP price 2025 beyond legal considerations: Adoption Metrics: Growth in RippleNet partnerships and ODL (On-Demand Liquidity) usage Market Conditions: Overall cryptocurrency market capitalization and Bitcoin dominance Technological Developments: Improvements to the XRP Ledger and interoperability solutions Macroeconomic Factors: Interest rates, inflation, and global economic stability XRP Price 2030: Long-Term Growth Potential Looking further ahead to XRP price 2030 requires considering broader adoption trends and technological evolution. By 2030, several key developments could significantly impact XRP’s value proposition: Mainstream Financial Integration: Potential integration with traditional banking systems and central bank digital currencies Global Payment Infrastructure: XRP could become a standard for international settlements Regulatory Clarity Worldwide: Clear frameworks in major economies beyond the United States Competitive Landscape: Evolution of competing payment solutions and blockchain technologies Most long-term predictions for XRP price 2030 range from conservative estimates of $3-5 to optimistic projections of $10-15, assuming widespread adoption and favorable regulatory conditions. The $5 milestone represents a psychologically important threshold that could trigger additional institutional investment. Will XRP Reach $5? The Critical Analysis The question of whether XRP can reach $5 depends on multiple converging factors. Historical data shows XRP briefly touched $3.84 in January 2018 during the previous bull market. To reach $5, XRP would need to overcome several challenges while capitalizing on its strengths. Key Requirements for XRP to Reach $5: Legal Resolution: A clear, favorable outcome in the Ripple SEC lawsuit or comprehensive regulatory framework Market Conditions: A strong cryptocurrency bull market with increased overall liquidity Adoption Growth: Significant expansion in RippleNet partnerships and transaction volume Institutional Investment: Increased participation from traditional financial institutions Technological Advancements: Continued development of the XRP Ledger and related infrastructure Ripple SEC Lawsuit: The Sword of Damocles The ongoing Ripple SEC lawsuit represents the single most significant factor affecting XRP’s price trajectory. The lawsuit, filed in December 2020, alleges that XRP constitutes an unregistered security. The outcome will determine XRP’s regulatory status in the United States, which in turn affects: Exchange listings and trading availability Institutional investment and custody solutions Partnership opportunities with traditional financial institutions Developer and ecosystem growth Recent developments have been mixed, with some favorable rulings for Ripple but no final resolution. The uncertainty continues to weigh on XRP’s price, creating both risk and potential opportunity for investors. Investment Considerations and Risk Factors Investing in XRP requires understanding both its potential rewards and significant risks. Unlike many cryptocurrencies, XRP’s value proposition is tightly linked to specific use cases and regulatory outcomes. Potential Benefits: Established partnerships with financial institutions worldwide Proven technology for cross-border payments with real-world usage Strong development team and corporate backing from Ripple Potential for regulatory clarity that could trigger price appreciation Significant Risks: Regulatory uncertainty, particularly in the United States Centralization concerns compared to more decentralized cryptocurrencies Competition from other payment solutions and blockchain projects Market volatility and correlation with broader cryptocurrency trends FAQs: Your XRP Questions Answered What is Ripple and how is it different from XRP? Ripple is a technology company that develops payment solutions, while XRP is the digital asset used within Ripple’s payment ecosystem. Ripple was co-founded by Chris Larsen and Brad Garlinghouse , who serves as CEO. How does the Ripple SEC lawsuit affect XRP’s price? The lawsuit creates regulatory uncertainty that affects exchange listings, institutional investment, and partnership opportunities. Positive developments typically boost price, while negative developments create selling pressure. What companies are using Ripple’s technology? Ripple has partnered with numerous financial institutions including MoneyGram , Santander , and Standard Chartered , though some partnerships have evolved or changed over time. Can XRP reach $10 by 2030? While possible under optimal conditions including widespread adoption, favorable regulations, and strong market conditions, $10 represents an ambitious target that would require significant growth from current levels. Is XRP a good long-term investment? This depends on individual risk tolerance, investment horizon, and belief in Ripple’s vision. XRP offers unique exposure to blockchain-based payments but carries significant regulatory and competitive risks. Conclusion: The Path Forward for XRP XRP stands at a crossroads between its proven utility in cross-border payments and ongoing regulatory challenges. The journey to $5 will require navigating complex legal landscapes while continuing to demonstrate real-world value through adoption and partnerships. While short-term volatility is likely, the long-term potential remains significant for investors who believe in the transformation of global payments. The coming years will determine whether XRP can fulfill its promise or remain constrained by regulatory uncertainty.

The token aims to give users what the industry calls “banking-level privacy” by hiding transaction details from public view. Aleo cofounder Howard Wu said the project tackles a core issue: blockchains are public, and that doesn’t work for institutions like banks. “People don’t want to reveal their business revenues. They don’t want to reveal business intelligence,” Howard allegedly told Fortune . USDCx is still tied to the U.S. dollar, like any stablecoin, but it’s built differently. Transactions on Aleo appear as blobs of data to anyone scanning the chain. But they’re not invisible. Each one comes with a compliance record accessible by Circle if law enforcement requests it. Howard described it as “banking-level privacy, as opposed to ‘privacy privacy.’” Banks show interest as tokenization trend grows The move comes as crypto firms push traditional finance players to use blockchain. And it’s working. BlackRock launched a tokenized money market fund called BUIDL. Robinhood tested blockchain-based stock trading. Stripe put serious money into stablecoins. In his 2025 investor letter, Larry Fink, BlackRock’s CEO, said: “Every stock, every bond, every fund—every asset—can be tokenized.” Howard said Aleo has already drawn attention from payroll services like Request Finance and Toku, who want to use USDCx to handle salaries with privacy intact. Prediction markets, where users bet on sports and global events, are also exploring the token. Aleo isn’t alone in the privacy space. Coins like Zcash also offer encrypted transactions. But they’re volatile; their price can swing wildly. That’s why Circle believes stablecoins like USDCx, which hold their value, have a better shot at gaining traction with companies and financial platforms.

According to real-time data from Binance’s USDT trading pair, BTC is currently trading at $91,147.77. This significant milestone marks a powerful moment of bullish momentum, capturing the attention of investors worldwide. But what’s fueling this impressive rally, and is it sustainable? Let’s break down the key factors. What’s Driving This Major Bitcoin Price Surge? The recent Bitcoin price surge isn’t happening in a vacuum. Several converging factors are creating a perfect storm of positive sentiment. First, increasing institutional adoption continues to provide a solid foundation of demand. Major financial firms are not just holding Bitcoin but actively integrating it into their offerings. Secondly, macroeconomic conditions are playing a role. With concerns about inflation persisting in many economies, investors are increasingly turning to Bitcoin as a potential store of value, much like digital gold. This flight to quality assets can trigger rapid price appreciation. Key Levels and Market Sentiment to Watch Breaking through the $91,000 barrier is a major psychological victory. However, savvy traders know that sustaining momentum requires holding key support levels. The market will now be watching how BTC behaves around this new price territory. Resistance: The next major targets for bulls will be the $92,500 and $95,000 levels. Support: On any pullback, the $89,000 and $87,500 zones become critical to hold to maintain the bullish structure. Volume: Sustained high trading volume confirms the strength of the move and genuine buyer interest. Market sentiment, often measured by tools like the Fear and Greed Index, has likely shifted firmly into “Greed” or even “Extreme Greed” territory. While this indicates excitement, it can also signal that the market is becoming overbought in the short term. What Does This Mean for Crypto Investors? For long-term holders, this Bitcoin price surge validates the core investment thesis of digital scarcity and adoption. However, for active traders and new entrants, it presents both opportunity and risk. The volatile nature of crypto means prices can correct just as quickly as they rise. Therefore, a disciplined approach is crucial. Consider these actionable insights: Dollar-Cost Average (DCA): Avoid trying to time the exact top or bottom. Consistent, scheduled investments can smooth out volatility. Secure Your Assets: Ensure your BTC is stored securely in a non-custodial wallet if you’re not actively trading. Do Your Own Research (DYOR): Never invest based solely on price momentum. Understand the technology and long-term value proposition. The Bigger Picture: Bitcoin’s Evolving Role Beyond the immediate price action, this Bitcoin price surge highlights Bitcoin’s evolving role in the global financial system. It is transitioning from a speculative internet asset to a recognized macro asset class. Each cycle brings greater legitimacy, more robust infrastructure, and deeper liquidity. Regulatory clarity, while still a work in progress in many regions, is gradually improving. This provides a more stable environment for institutional capital to enter, which in turn can reduce extreme volatility over the long run. The current price reflects not just speculation, but growing confidence in Bitcoin’s fundamental utility. Conclusion: A Milestone in an Ongoing Journey The breakthrough above $91,000 is a stunning testament to Bitcoin’s resilience and growing adoption. This Bitcoin price surge represents a significant milestone, but it is just one chapter in a much longer story. While short-term fluctuations are inevitable, the long-term trend for Bitcoin, driven by its fixed supply and increasing demand, continues to point upward. For investors, the key is to maintain perspective, manage risk, and focus on the fundamental technological revolution that Bitcoin represents. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: Why did Bitcoin suddenly surge above $91,000? A1: The surge is likely due to a combination of factors, including positive institutional inflows, favorable macroeconomic sentiment as a hedge against inflation, and technical breakout momentum from key price levels. Q2: Is it too late to buy Bitcoin after this price surge? A2: Cryptocurrency investing carries risk at any price point. Many investors use a strategy called Dollar-Cost Averaging (DCA) to invest fixed amounts regularly, which mitigates the risk of buying at a single high price. Q3: Could the price crash back down just as quickly? A3> Yes, cryptocurrency markets are notoriously volatile. Sharp rallies can be followed by corrections. It’s essential to only invest what you can afford to lose and have a clear risk management strategy. Q4: Where is the best place to track the Bitcoin price? A4: Reputable cryptocurrency data aggregators and major exchanges like Binance, Coinbase, and Kraken provide real-time price data. Always use trusted sources for market information. Q5: Does this surge affect other cryptocurrencies (altcoins)? A5> Often, a strong Bitcoin price surge can create a positive “halo effect” for the broader crypto market, lifting altcoin prices. However, the relationship can vary based on market cycles. Q6: What’s the next major price target for Bitcoin? A6: While predictions are speculative, traders often watch round numbers and previous all-time highs as psychological targets. The $95,000 and $100,000 levels are widely discussed as the next major milestones. Found this analysis of the stunning Bitcoin price surge helpful?

This is the ambitious vision of the Canton Network , and it just took a monumental leap forward. The network has announced a pivotal partnership with RedStone Oracles to provide the critical data backbone for its emerging RWA ecosystem , valued at a staggering $6 trillion. This collaboration isn’t just a technical integration; it’s the key that unlocks institutional-grade, real-world asset tokenization at an unprecedented scale. Why Is the Canton Network and RedStone Oracle Partnership a Game-Changer? The core challenge in tokenizing real-world assets (RWAs) is trust. How can a smart contract on a blockchain reliably know the price of a commercial building or the interest payment on a private bond? This is where oracles come in. They act as secure bridges, fetching verified data from the traditional world and feeding it onto the blockchain. By selecting RedStone Oracles , the Canton Network is choosing a provider known for its modular design, high-frequency data updates, and robust security—essential ingredients for multi-trillion dollar markets. What Does This Mean for the $6 Trillion RWA Vision? The scale of the ambition is breathtaking. A $6 trillion RWA ecosystem represents a fundamental shift in how global finance operates. Here’s what this integration enables: Unprecedented Liquidity: Illiquid assets like private equity or fine art can be fractionalized and traded 24/7. Automated Compliance: Smart contracts can automatically enforce regulatory rules and ownership transfers. Enhanced Transparency: Every transaction and asset provenance is recorded immutably on the ledger. Reduced Costs: By cutting out numerous intermediaries, settlement and administrative expenses plummet. With RedStone Oracles supplying accurate, tamper-proof data feeds—from interest rates and forex prices to specific asset valuations—the Canton Network can build financial applications that institutions can trust. How Will RedStone Oracles Power the Canton Network’s Infrastructure? Think of the Canton Network as a secure, interoperable blockchain designed for privacy and compliance, tailored for financial institutions. For its applications to function, they need constant, reliable information. RedStone Oracles will serve as the network’s sensory system, delivering crucial data for various use cases: On-chain Fund NAVs: Providing real-time Net Asset Values for tokenized investment funds. Interest Rate Feeds: Enabling dynamic variable-rate lending and borrowing against RWA collateral. FX & Commodity Prices: Facilitating cross-border settlements and tokenized commodity trading. Corporate Action Data: Automating dividend distributions or bond coupon payments for tokenized securities. This reliable data layer is the foundation upon which the entire RWA ecosystem will be built, ensuring all smart contracts execute based on truth. What Are the Challenges and the Road Ahead? While the potential is revolutionary, the path is not without hurdles. Regulatory frameworks across different jurisdictions are still evolving. Furthermore, ensuring the absolute security and reliability of oracle data at this scale is paramount—a single point of failure could have systemic consequences. However, the partnership between the Canton Network and RedStone Oracles directly addresses this last mile of the trust problem. By combining Canton’s privacy-focused architecture with RedStone’s resilient data delivery, they are constructing a formidable solution designed for institutional adoption. The Final Verdict: A New Chapter for Finance The integration of RedStone Oracles into the Canton Network is more than a technical milestone; it’s a declaration that the tokenization of real-world assets is moving from pilot projects to prime time. This partnership provides the essential, trustworthy data layer needed to manage $6 trillion in value. It signals to traditional finance that blockchain infrastructure is now mature enough to handle their most complex and valuable assets. The fusion of Canton’s compliant network and RedStone’s robust oracles doesn’t just build an RWA ecosystem —it builds the future rails of global capital markets. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q: What is the Canton Network? A: The Canton Network is a privacy-enabled, interoperable blockchain network specifically designed for institutional financial applications, with a focus on tokenizing real-world assets (RWAs). Q: What role do RedStone Oracles play in this? A: RedStone Oracles act as secure data bridges. They fetch verified, real-world information (like asset prices, interest rates) and feed it onto the Canton Network, allowing smart contracts to execute automatically based on accurate data. Q: Why is this partnership important for the RWA sector? A> Trustworthy data is the biggest hurdle for RWAs. This partnership solves that by providing a high-integrity data layer, enabling complex financial products like tokenized bonds, funds, and private assets to function reliably on-chain. Q: What types of assets could be tokenized on this $6 trillion ecosystem? A> Virtually any financial asset: government and corporate bonds, real estate, private equity stakes, commodities, intellectual property royalties, and more. Q: How does this benefit the average investor? A> It promises greater access to investment opportunities that were previously illiquid or restricted to large institutions, potentially offering better yields and portfolio diversification.

55557298,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=875557,1765294537,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/55557298.jpeg,Saudi Arabia’s global ‘data embassy’ plan challenges traditional digital sovereignty,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/saudi-arabia-plans-ai-data-embassies/,"While countries rush to construct computer data facilities within their own territories for artificial intelligence, Saudi Arabia has announced plans for something different: data embassies spread across the globe. So what is data embassy? Think of a data embassy as a regular embassy, but for information. The data sits in another country, yet the laws protecting it come from the nation that owns it. It’s an unusual approach that only two countries have tried before. Estonia pioneered this idea back in 2017. Monaco followed later. Both nations keep backup copies of important government information in Luxembourg, designed as protection against hackers and natural disasters. Now, as artificial intelligence demands grow, this concept might catch on. Countries facing power shortages, especially in Europe, could store data in regions with abundant electricity and resources. The information would still follow the home country’s rules. Saudi Arabia sees an opportunity here. The kingdom wants to export data storage services instead of just oil. The country plans major investments in solar power, though experts worry about one problem: water. Data centers need massive amounts of water for cooling, and This comes as Middle Eastern nations compete to become technology hubs. Global investors and tech companies are looking to the region for its wealth and growing talent pool, potentially changing where power sits in the technology world. Making deals presents challenges Setting up these data embassies won’t be easy. Viktor Mayer-Schönberger, who teaches internet governance at the University of Oxford, explained to CNBC that countries would need international agreements on legal authority. Right now, no such framework exists. Both the country hosting the data and the country owning it would need guarantees that neither side breaks the agreement. “This will ultimately depend on the trust of the parties involved,” Mayer-Schönberger said. Saudi Arabia wants to be the first G20 nation with such a system. This April, officials released a draft law outlining three types of data embassies. These range from the guest country keeping complete control to shared arrangements where Saudi courts could help foreign courts. The move shows how competition in artificial intelligence is changing relationships between nations. Saudi Arabia has grown closer to the United States, though no specific partnership on data embassies has been announced. The two countries have established a “Strategic Artificial Intelligence Partnership” focused on “building and developing advanced AI infrastructure.” Nations worldwide have pledged enormous amounts for AI projects. The European Union set aside $230 billion for such efforts. Could this solve disputes like the TikTok situation, where American officials worried China accessed user data and influenced the 2024 election? Mayer-Schönberger doubts it. “It would require a complex bilateral treaty between China and the US that would take very long to negotiate,” he said. Given the mistrust between the nations, Americans wouldn’t believe China would keep the data secure. Major technology companies Google and Microsoft already provide European customers with local data storage for sensitive information, along with special rules limiting U.S. government access. Whether these arrangements truly protect data “remains to be seen,” Mayer-Schönberger noted. Unclear rules and real concerns As globalization weakens and countries focus more on national security and economic competition, data sovereignty has become important. But regulations remain unclear. Nathalie Barrera, who leads privacy and data regulations for Europe, Middle East, and Africa at Palo Alto Networks, pointed out that sovereignty means different things to different countries. “Everyone’s talking about it, but no one has defined it,” she told CNBC. Her company’s clients want three things: control over their data and who sees it, reliable service that doesn’t stop, and protection from foreign governments accessing information. Barrera compared data embassies to existing European laws. “This is not unsimilar than the extra territoriality effect of GDPR,” she explained. Data in America can still fall under European regulations. These embassies just offer another way to protect sensitive government information like tax records, health data, and administrative files. Saudi Arabia offers attractive prices. Land costs less there, as does electricity and investment capital. The country sits between Europe , the Middle East, and Asia, making it geographically convenient. “It makes sense if Saudi Arabia can offer data centre services at a lower cost than countries that need them,” said Hortense Bioy, who heads sustainable investing research at Morningstar Sustainalytics. However, she warned about environmental concerns. “The rise of data centres introduces new ESG considerations which are now widely recognised, with carbon emissions and water intensity among the most pressing concerns.” Despite abundant sunshine, Saudi Arabia still runs mostly on fossil fuels. Oil provided 64% of the country’s total energy in 2023, according to International Energy Agency figures. Countries might have to choose between controlling their data and protecting the environment. Mayer-Schönberger remains doubtful about data embassies becoming widespread. “The nation state remains too powerful, and globalization is waning,” he said.

In this line, over the past five reported trading days, inflows reached approximately $173 million, led by notable allocations into the Franklin XRP ETF and the Grayscale XRP Trust, according to data retrieved by Finbold from Coinglass . The most notable day came on December 1, when total flows soared to nearly $90 million, driven primarily by a single-session addition of more than $52 million into the Grayscale product and more than $28 million into the Franklin fund. XRP ETF total inflows chart. Source: Coinglass December 8 also delivered a strong showing as combined inflows topped $38 million, reflecting steady institutional accumulation. Despite these sizable inflows, XRP’s price has not responded in a manner typically associated with such demand. The token has remained range-bound near the $2 level, weighed down by broader cryptocurrency market uncertainty and persistent selling from larger holders. XRP price analysis By press time, XRP was trading at $2.07 having corrected by about 0.5% in the past 24 hours while on the weekly timeline, the asset has plunged almost 4%. XRP seven-day price chart. Source: Finbold Recent analysis indicates that the muted price reaction stems partly from how XRP ETF issuers acquire the underlying asset. Much of the buying happens through over-the-counter channels rather than public exchanges, so the demand does not immediately impact visible order books. At the same time, profit-taking by long-time investors offsets institutional inflows, creating a short-term disconnect between ETF demand and spot-market movement. Even so, total ETF assets under management are already nearing the billion-dollar mark, marking one of the fastest adoption trajectories for a new crypto ETF category. While this strengthens XRP’s long-term outlook, the near-term picture remains uncertain, with markets watching whether strong inflow momentum can overcome weak sentiment and push the token above resistance levels such as $2.5.

Its core function is to record brief audio notes—think 3 to 6 seconds—when you press and hold a button on its side. The AI smart ring doesn’t process audio itself. Instead, it syncs recordings to your smartphone, where open-source speech-to-text and AI models transcribe them locally. This means no cloud storage, no subscriptions, and no constant listening. It’s a tool for intentional capture, not passive surveillance. How Does This Voice Note Wearable Work? The genius of the Index 01 lies in its constrained, user-controlled operation. Here’s how it functions: Press-and-Hold to Record: You must physically press and hold the button to activate recording, preventing accidental or surreptitious use. It stops when you release. Local-Only Processing: Audio is saved to the ring’s onboard memory (enough for ~5 minutes) and later synced via Bluetooth to the Pebble app on your phone. All transcription happens on your device. Long-Lasting Battery: Migicovsky claims the battery can last up to two years with typical use (10-20 recordings per day). When it dies, you return it for recycling. Open-Source & Hackable: The ring’s software is open source. The button can be reprogrammed for single/double-press actions like controlling music or a camera shutter. Index 01 vs. The Competition: A Privacy-Focused Alternative The market for voice note wearables is growing. Last month, startup Sandbar unveiled its $249 Stream Ring, which requires a $10/month subscription for full functionality. The Index 01 carves out a distinct niche with its philosophy. Feature Index 01 Ring Typical AI Wearables Price Model $75 one-time, no subscription Often $200+ with monthly fees Listening Mode Only on button press-and-hold Often always-on/listening Data Storage Local on your smartphone Frequently in the cloud Primary Goal External memory, quick notes AI assistant, conversation Health Tracking None Often includes heart rate, sleep “I’m not trying to build some AI assistant thing,” Migicovsky stated. “I build things that solve one main problem, and they solve it really well… I think of [the ring] as external memory for my brain.” This makes the Index 01 a privacy-focused wearable by design. Why the Pebble Founder is Betting on Simplicity Eric Migicovsky has a unique perspective on hardware. After Pebble’s acquisition by Fitbit (later Google), he’s taking a different path with Core Devices: small team, self-funded, and focused on sustainable profitability from the start. The Index 01 reflects this. It’s not a venture-backed moonshot but a refined tool. He’s also rebooted the Pebble smartwatch line, with the new Pebble Time 2 racking up 25,000 pre-orders. The AI smart ring represents this new, focused approach to building hardware companies. Who Should Buy This AI Smart Ring? The Index 01 isn’t for everyone. It’s a specialist tool ideal for: Ideators & Builders: Crypto developers, writers, and entrepreneurs who need to capture ideas instantly. Privacy-Conscious Users: Those wary of always-on mics and cloud data storage. Minimalists: People tired of device charging and complex app ecosystems. This ring works for years on a battery. Pebble Enthusiasts: Fans of the brand’s ethos can integrate notes with their Pebble watch. Pre-orders for the Index 01 are open until March 2026, after which the price rises to $99. It comes in three finishes and eight sizes. Conclusion: A Thoughtful Step for Wearable AI The Index 01 AI smart ring is a compelling counter-narrative in a market racing toward ambient, intrusive computing. By championing user control, local processing, and a single, well-executed function, Eric Migicovsky has created a privacy-focused wearable that feels both nostalgic and futuristic. It proves that innovation isn’t always about adding more features—sometimes, it’s about perfecting one. For anyone whose best ideas vanish as quickly as they appear, this $75 ring might be the most valuable piece of hardware they own.

In other words, the number of leveraged long positions is going down as traders step back from excessive risk. If the Bitcoin funding rate continues to slide, it could signal a deeper shift toward more bearish territory. Such conditions often culminate in volatility spikes as well, as even mild price pullbacks can trigger swift liquidation waves. BTC derivatives overview. Source: CryptoQuant The BTC funding rate collapse also coincided with a modest 0.66% dip in Bitcoin’s open interest, suggesting that a small portion of leveraged long positions has already been flushed out. Bitcoin funding rates drop ahead of key macro deadlines The loss of optimism in Bitcoin follows the broader crypto market, which was nearly 2% in the red in the early hours due to fear regarding the Federal Reserve decision due tomorrow. If the Fed adopts a more hawkish tone, a stronger dollar and tighter liquidity conditions could put more pressure on risk assets such as Bitcoin, prompting traders to unwind leveraged bets even further. Considering Bitcoin’s technical picture was nothing to write home about either, the asset was shaky on all fronts, which further contributed to the fear. Indeed, “digital gold” was trading at $90,410 at press time, down 1.28% on the day with a confirmed bear flag pattern threatening a correction toward the $70,000 area. BTC one-day price chart. Source: Finbold The ongoing Bitcoin funding rate slump thus reflects a combination of factors, the most notable being aggressive long unwinding and loss of speculative appetite ahead of key macro catalysts. While certainly a bad omen at first glance, the setup still comes with a potential silver lining, as it could set the stage for a more stable market structure in the short term once the dust has settled. Similar scenarios have already played out in August and October this year. Accordingly, traders will be monitoring whether the cooling leverage environment leads to consolidation or whether renewed volatility emerges as futures markets reset.

The Australian Securities and Investments Commission (ASIC) on Tuesday finalized class relief for intermediaries handling the secondary distribution of certain stablecoins and wrapped tokens. The decision allows exchanges and other service providers to operate without holding separate Australian financial services, market, or clearing and settlement licenses when dealing with eligible products. ASIC said the move is intended to support innovation as the government works on a permanent regime for digital asset platforms and payment systems. Source: ASIC ASIC Confirms Omnibus Custody Relief After Industry Feedback The relief also extends to custody, as providers will be permitted to hold tokenized financial products in omnibus accounts, a structure commonly used in traditional markets but long restricted in crypto. ASIC said the exemption will only apply if firms maintain proper records and reconciliation procedures. The regulator initially signaled this shift in October when it published the latest update to its key digital-asset guidance, INFO 225. Tuesday’s announcement marks the end point of a consultation that began on 29 October , when ASIC released Simple Consultation 32 outlining proposed exemptions for stablecoins and wrapped assets. Australia requires stablecoin and digital asset providers to obtain financial services licenses under new ASIC guidance effective June 2026. #Australia #Stablecoin https://t.co/OECNhNHLUz — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) October 29, 2025 The regulator received five non-confidential submissions, with industry groups largely supporting the plan but requesting clearer definitions and wider eligibility. ASIC responded by expanding the scope to include tokens issued by entities that have applied for licenses. The changes sit on top of a broader framework that ASIC has been assembling throughout the year. The regulator’s updated INFO 225 guidance, published in late October, confirmed its long-held view that many stablecoins, wrapped tokens, tokenized securities, and even digital asset wallets fall under existing financial product rules. Stablecoin Issuers Get Temporary Breather Under ASIC’s Transition Plan That interpretation requires most service providers to hold AFS licenses and comply with investor-protection laws already in force. To ease the transition, ASIC has adopted a sector-wide no-action stance until June 30, 2026. Companies will have time to review the new guidance, lodge license applications, or adjust their operations. Australia's ASIC grants stablecoin intermediary relief from licensing requirements until 2028, with Catena Digital as the first qualified issuer. #Australia #Stablecoin https://t.co/vi2mBPwPbb — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) September 18, 2025 The temporary relief is expected to remain in place until mid-2028, by which time the government aims to replace it with legislation covering tokenized payments and custody structures. ASIC has indicated it may add more issuers after several firms said existing licensing hurdles threatened the commercial viability of launching Australian-regulated stablecoins. Intermediaries must still provide retail investors with Product Disclosure Statements, a condition ASIC argues balances flexibility with consumer safeguards. Regulators Tighten Grip as Australia Races to Catch Up in Digital Assets The exemptions land at a moment when policymakers say Australia risks slipping behind global competitors. ASIC Chair Joe Longo warned last month that tokenization is reshaping capital markets and urged the country to modernize quickly or face what he called a “missed opportunity.” Government proposals released in September would require exchanges to obtain AFS licenses and impose penalties of up to 10% of annual turnover for rule breaches . Smaller platforms meeting low-threshold criteria would be exempt. Australia is set to slap crypto platforms with fines as steep as 10% of turnover under tough new draft rules, the Treasury said Thursday. #Australia #CryptoRegulation https://t.co/eVdrLlJgnd — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) September 25, 2025 The push for tighter supervision has not stopped enforcement actions.

The government plans to complete legislative amendments in 2026, strengthening the city’s commitment to international tax cooperation while maintaining its reputation as a global financial hub amid evolving digital asset regulations. Financial Services Secretary Christopher Hui announced “ Hong Kong will make amendments to the Inland Revenue Ordinance (Cap. 112) (the Ordinance) for implementing CARF and the newly amended CRS ” and demonstrated a commitment to combating cross-border tax evasion. The automatic exchange will operate on a reciprocal basis with partners meeting data confidentiality and security standards, with the newly amended CRS implementation scheduled for 2029. Secretary for Financial Services and the Treasury Christopher Hui. | Source: The Standard Framework Responds to Rapid Digital Asset Growth The OECD published CARF in 2023 following the rapid expansion of the digital asset market in recent years, providing automatic exchange of crypto transaction tax information similar to Hong Kong’s existing CRS framework, operational since 2018. The new framework incorporated digital financial products and enhanced reporting requirements, addressing gaps in traditional financial account information exchange. Hong Kong has been exchanging financial account information automatically with partner jurisdictions annually since 2018 under the CRS, enabling tax authorities to use the information for assessments and to detect tax evasion. The CARF extension builds upon this established infrastructure, applying similar transparency standards to crypto assets that process billions in trading volume across the city’s licensed exchanges. The government proposes mandatory registration for financial institutions to enhance identification, alongside increased penalties and enhanced enforcement mechanisms. These measures respond to the OECD’s second-round peer review of Hong Kong’s CRS administrative framework effectiveness, which began in 2024 and examines the city’s commitment to global tax transparency standards. Balancing Innovation and Compliance Pressures The consultation arrives as Hong Kong navigates competing pressures between fostering digital asset innovation and satisfying international regulatory standards. The city has pursued aggressive fintech expansion through its new “ Fintech 2030 ” strategy launched by the Hong Kong Monetary Authority, focusing on data, artificial intelligence, resilience, and tokenization under the DART framework. Hong Kong has courted crypto activity through licensing regimes and spot crypto exchange-traded funds, seeking regulated venues for demand. Securities and Futures Commission Chief Executive Julia Leung recently announced licensed crypto exchanges will soon connect with global order books , ending the city’s isolated trading model and enabling local platforms to tap broader liquidity. Hong Kong will allow licensed crypto exchanges to connect with global order books, ending its current isolated trading model. #HongKong #Crypto https://t.co/f8Lj9NKxoR — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) November 3, 2025 Despite regulatory openness, authorities have drawn bright lines between market infrastructure and listed issuers relying on speculative token holdings. The stock exchange questioned at least five companies seeking to pivot to crypto treasury models, while the SFC warned retail investors about risks tied to digital asset treasury strategies after observing substantial premiums above asset holdings. Amidst all these, HashKey Holdings advanced toward becoming Hong Kong’s first listed crypto exchange , clearing the stock exchange’s listing hearing and preparing to raise at least $200 million through an initial public offering scheduled before year-end. The company accounts for more than 75% of Hong Kong’s onshore digital asset trading volume and has recorded HK$1.3 trillion in cumulative spot-market transactions. Mainland Tensions Shape Regional Strategy The consultation also unfolds against mainland China’s renewed crypto crackdown, with the People’s Bank of China reasserting strict prohibitions on virtual asset trading in late November following signs of renewed speculation. Beijing specifically flagged stablecoins as posing money laundering and fraud risks, convening a high-level meeting with 13 government agencies to coordinate enforcement.

The country has officially launched USDKG, a pioneering gold-backed stablecoin designed to streamline cross-border transactions and bolster economic stability. This initiative marks a significant step for a national government directly embracing blockchain technology for sovereign financial operations. What Is the Kyrgyzstan Gold-Backed Stablecoin? The Kyrgyzstan gold-backed stablecoin , named USDKG, represents a fusion of traditional asset security with digital innovation. It is a digital currency pegged 1:1 to the US dollar, with its value directly backed by physical gold reserves held by the National Bank of Kyrgyzstan. This dual-backing mechanism aims to provide exceptional price stability, combining the trust of gold with the efficiency of a dollar peg. The initial issuance is valued at a substantial $50 million, signaling serious governmental commitment. According to reports from CryptoBriefing, the stablecoin first launched on the high-throughput Tron blockchain network. This choice likely prioritizes transaction speed and lower costs for its initial phase. However, plans are already in motion for a future issuance on the Ethereum network, which would expand its interoperability and access within the broader decentralized finance (DeFi) ecosystem. Why Launch a National Gold-Backed Stablecoin? Kyrgyzstan’s primary goal is to modernize and secure its cross-border payment systems. Traditional international money transfers can be slow, expensive, and opaque. A blockchain-based gold-backed stablecoin offers a compelling alternative with several potential benefits: Faster Settlements: Transactions can settle in minutes, 24/7, unlike traditional banking hours. Reduced Costs: Cutting out multiple intermediaries can significantly lower fees for remittances and trade. Enhanced Transparency: Blockchain provides a verifiable and immutable record of all transactions. Financial Inclusion: It can provide easier access to digital dollars and gold for citizens and businesses. Economic Sovereignty: Reduces reliance on foreign payment networks and potentially strengthens the national currency. What Are the Challenges and Considerations? While innovative, this venture is not without its hurdles. Success depends on widespread adoption by businesses, financial institutions, and the public, which requires building significant trust in the new system. Furthermore, the project must navigate a complex global regulatory landscape for digital assets. The technical security of the blockchain infrastructure and the gold custodianship are also paramount to maintain the coin’s promised stability and prevent fraud. Kyrgyzstan’s model could serve as a blueprint for other nations, especially those with substantial natural resource reserves. A successfully implemented national gold-backed stablecoin might inspire similar projects, potentially creating a new class of sovereign digital assets. Conclusion: A Pioneering Step in Digital Finance Kyrgyzstan’s launch of the USDKG gold-backed stablecoin is a landmark experiment at the intersection of traditional finance and cryptocurrency. It demonstrates a practical, asset-backed approach to national digital currencies aimed at solving real-world economic problems. The world will be watching closely to see if this model delivers on its promise of faster, cheaper, and more transparent cross-border finance, potentially charting a new course for other economies to follow. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q: What exactly is USDKG? A: USDKG is a digital stablecoin issued by Kyrgyzstan. It is pegged 1:1 to the US dollar and backed by physical gold reserves held by the country’s national bank. Q: On which blockchain is USDKG available? A: It was initially launched on the Tron blockchain. The developers have announced plans to also issue it on the Ethereum network in the future to increase its reach. Q: Who can use the Kyrgyzstan gold-backed stablecoin? A: While details on access are still emerging, it is designed for use in cross-border payments and trade. It will likely be available to businesses, financial institutions, and potentially the general public in Kyrgyzstan and partner regions. Q: How is this different from other stablecoins like USDT or USDC? A> Most major stablecoins are backed by financial assets like cash and bonds. USDKG is unique because it is issued by a national government and has its value doubly guaranteed by both a US dollar peg and direct backing with physical gold. Q: What is the main goal of launching USDKG? A: The primary goal is to modernize Kyrgyzstan’s financial system by making cross-border payments faster, cheaper, and more transparent using blockchain technology. Q: Are there any risks involved? A> As with any new financial technology, risks include the need for widespread adoption, regulatory changes, and the paramount importance of securing both the digital platform and the physical gold reserves.

Dogecoin (DOGE) and Shiba Inu (SHIB) continue to be the leading players on the meme coin front, fueled by huge and highly engaged communities and renewed volatility that frequently precedes historic blowouts. However, the token that is gaining significant attention from most investors is Mutuum Finance (MUTM) , a dramatically escalating new crypto coin now available for just $0.035 and boasting more than 18,400 holders within its presale. With Phase 6 having sold out over 95% and more than $19.25 million raised within the ambitious project so far, MUTM is clearly differentiating itself by offering a decentralized platform for lending and borrowing within the crypto realm, interest-bearing token functionality, and imminent release on Sepolia Testnet this quarter. As analysts cast their gaze upon the horizon for what may represent the next big blowout cycle for altcoins within the crypto market, DOGE and SHIB continue to lead core community fervor, with emerging token leader MUTM increasingly being regarded as the token with the greatest utility and the next crypto to hit $1. Dogecoin Tests Key Support Amid Risk of Correction Dogecoin (DOGE) is currently with its micro-support at around $0.136 levels and is a crucial support that would decide whether the bullish thesis is slated to be achieved. However, analysts do point out that while a potential breakthrough above the upper band may again trigger the bullish momentum, there may be prospects for a Wave 2 Correction and thus traders seem apprehensive at this stage. In addition, traders seem to be increasingly drawn to newer tokens with good adoption such as Mutuum Finance (MUTM). Shiba Inu Displays Indicators of Bullish Trend with Key Support Level Unbroken Current prices for Shiba Inu (SHIB) are around $0.00000846, consolidating at a vital support position and indicating possible short-term strength. On a technical analysis of the token on the 3-hour chart, SHIB is likely to continue moving with a possible support levels breakthrough at the $0.00000939 resistance and sampling higher at $0.00000952 USDT with sustained support from the buy momentum. A possible breakthrough above $0.00000860 with increased volume would confirm the support and offer entered purchase positions for traders tracking the momentum and candlestick trends. In a market with popular meme assets such as SHIB experiencing potential short-term volatility and structural hindrance for expansion and adoption, current investor interest is increasingly diverted towards promising developing assets with adoption and utility advancement functions such as Mutuum Finance (MUTM). MUTM Presale Soars With Phase 6 Nearing Completion Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is emerging as the best crypto to buy with widened attraction amongst investors. The presale is filled with huge excitement amongst investors with more than 18,400 participants pooling a cumulative amount of $19.25 million. At the moment, the prices for Phase 6 tokens are at $0.035 and more than 95% of the phase has been sold out. Phase 7 is expected to kick off soon with a token price increase of 20% to $0.04. Considering the limited number and high growth potential for the project down the road, this might be one of the best opportunities to purchase tokens at a discount and be part of the next crypto to hit $1. Sepolia Testnet Hits Major Development Milestone Mutuum Finance is gearing up for the launch of its V1 lending and borrowing platform on the Sepolia testnet environment. The beta testing stage gives the project team sufficient time to test all core DeFi features such as lending, borrowing, and yield farming on the network. In this regard, by focusing on utility, scalability, and security above all else, Mutuum Finance is creating a specific niche for itself within the DeFi sector and thus establishing its position within the crypto investment sector as the new crypto coin for serious investors. Dogecoin and Shiba Inu come with structural constraints, while for Mutuum Finance there is great utility potential for a project at such a nascent stage. With tokens at Phase 6 for $0.035 over 95% sold out, the project enjoys support from more than 18,400 investors and with $19.25 million funding raised. Shortly to be launched is Sepolia Testnet V1 for lending and borrowing and later yield farming services that can make Mutuum Finance (MUTM) the next crypto to hit $1.

55557901,642465,1765296005,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/55557901.jpeg,Big Bitcoin Move: Galaxy Digital Sends 900 BTC To New Address,https://bitcoinist.com/big-bitcoin-move-galaxy-digital-sends-900-btc-to-new-address/,"Galaxy Digital, a major crypto services firm, transferred 900 BTC to a wallet that was created shortly before the move on December 9, 2025, according to on-chain monitoring shared by blockchain analysts. The coins were valued at close to $81.60 million at the time of the transfer, implying an average price near $90,656 per Bitcoin . Large Bitcoin Transfer Logged According to on-chain trackers , the receiving address showed no prior history, which caught attention because transfers of this size tend to leave a clear trail and invite scrutiny. The initial notice came from blockchain sleuths who flagged the transaction and published the receiving address for public view. No public statement has come from Galaxy Digital to explain the move. What The Move Could Mean Based on reports, big transfers by firms like Galaxy Digital often involve custody reshuffles, client orders, or trades arranged off-exchange. That said, a transfer to a brand-new address does not by itself prove a sale took place. A newly created wallet received 900 $BTC ($81.59M) from Galaxy Digital 2 hours ago. https://t.co/Ahrqpn4Hip pic.twitter.com/EIWmMXyWJZ — Lookonchain (@lookonchain) December 9, 2025 The coins might be placed into cold storage, moved between internal wallets, or prepared for an over-the-counter trade. Public data show only the on-chain flow; the motive behind it remains unconfirmed. Background On Galaxy Digital Galaxy Digital has handled several very large transactions this year, and that track record adds context to the latest move. Earlier in 2025 the firm facilitated a notably large transfer tied to a long-dormant early Bitcoin holder, a sequence of transactions that amounted to tens of thousands of BTC and drew wide market attention. Those prior actions showed Galaxy operating as a major intermediary when big holders decide to move or sell coins. Market Reaction And Risks Traders watched price action closely after the transfer was flagged, but the mere movement of BTC between wallets does not always trigger market swings. If the coins entered an exchange or were offered for public sale, price impact would be more likely. If they remained in custody or were split into smaller distributions, the market effect could be muted. For now, there is no public evidence that the transfer caused immediate selling or that the funds were liquidated. What To Watch Next Observers will look for follow-up on-chain flows — for instance, whether the new address sends coins onward, or whether linked wallets show signs of exchange deposits. Analysts will also watch for any official comments from Galaxy Digital or disclosures tied to client mandates. Until then, the facts are limited to the Bitcoin transaction record itself and the valuation snapshot reported when the move was first spotted.

The blockchain platform specializing in regulatory-compliant real-world assets (RWA) just secured a commercial license from the Abu Dhabi Global Market (ADGM), positioning itself as a pioneer in bridging traditional finance with blockchain technology. This strategic move opens doors to massive expansion across emerging economies. Why Does This Abu Dhabi License Matter for Real-World Assets? The Abu Dhabi Global Market represents one of the world’s most progressive financial regulatory environments. When a blockchain platform like Plume receives their commercial license, it signals more than just permission to operate—it represents institutional validation. This approval enables Plume to expand its RWA issuance and distribution across the Middle East, Africa, and other emerging markets with regulatory confidence. Consider this: real-world assets represent trillions in value, but their movement across borders often faces regulatory hurdles. Plume’s license essentially creates a compliant bridge between physical assets and digital markets. The company plans to open an Abu Dhabi office by year’s end, followed by a broader business strategy announcement in early 2026. What Strategic Advantages Does This Create? Plume’s new position offers several immediate benefits for the real-world assets ecosystem: Regulatory Clarity : Operating within ADGM’s framework provides clear compliance guidelines for tokenizing physical assets Market Access : Direct pathways to Middle Eastern and African markets hungry for digital asset infrastructure Institutional Trust : Banking and fintech partnerships become more feasible with regulatory approval Scalability Blueprint : Success in Abu Dhabi could model expansion to other regulated jurisdictions The company has indicated its 2026 strategy will include local hiring and partnerships with regional banks and fintech firms. This approach demonstrates understanding that real-world asset adoption requires both technological innovation and local market integration. How Will This Impact Real-World Asset Tokenization Globally? Plume’s achievement creates ripple effects beyond the Middle East. As regulatory frameworks evolve worldwide, this license serves as a case study for how blockchain platforms can engage with traditional financial systems. The focus on real-world assets—from commodities to real estate to intellectual property—addresses one of blockchain’s most promising use cases. However, challenges remain. Different jurisdictions have varying approaches to asset tokenization, and cultural adoption barriers persist. Plume’s success will depend on executing their announced partnerships effectively and demonstrating tangible value to both asset owners and investors. What’s Next for Plume and Real-World Assets? The coming months will reveal how quickly Plume can capitalize on this regulatory advantage. Their planned Abu Dhabi office represents more than physical presence—it symbolizes commitment to the region’s growing fintech ecosystem. The early 2026 strategy announcement will likely address: Specific asset classes targeted for tokenization Partnership timelines with regional financial institutions Technology adaptations for local market needs Compliance frameworks for cross-border asset movement This development arrives as global interest in real-world assets reaches new heights. Traditional investors seek blockchain efficiency, while crypto natives want exposure to tangible assets. Plume’s regulated position uniquely bridges these worlds. Conclusion: A Watershed Moment for Asset Tokenization Plume’s Abu Dhabi Global Market license represents more than corporate expansion—it signifies growing institutional acceptance of blockchain’s role in traditional finance. For real-world assets specifically, this regulatory milestone could accelerate adoption across emerging markets that previously hesitated due to compliance concerns. The true test begins now: Can Plume transform regulatory approval into operational success? Their ability to partner with regional banks, tokenize meaningful assets, and deliver value to all participants will determine whether this becomes a blueprint or a footnote in blockchain’s evolution. Frequently Asked Questions What exactly is Plume’s business focus? Plume specializes in creating blockchain infrastructure for tokenizing real-world assets (RWA) like commodities, real estate, and other physical assets, with emphasis on regulatory compliance. Why is the Abu Dhabi Global Market license significant? ADGM represents a progressive financial regulatory environment. Their approval provides Plume with institutional credibility and a compliant framework to operate across multiple jurisdictions. Which markets will Plume target first? The company plans initial expansion across the Middle East and Africa, followed by other emerging markets that show demand for real-world asset tokenization. What types of real-world assets might be tokenized? While specific assets haven’t been announced, typical RWA categories include precious metals, real estate, agricultural commodities, intellectual property, and fine art. When will Plume’s expansion plans become clearer? The company stated it will announce a broader business strategy in early 2026, including specific partnerships and asset class focuses. How does this benefit traditional investors? Tokenization can make real-world assets more accessible, divisible, and liquid while maintaining regulatory compliance and institutional oversight.

This provides a bullish outlook for the second-largest meme coin by market cap, which has been one of the underperformers in this market cycle. Shiba Inu Sees Surge In Spot Trading Activity CoinGlass data show a 154% surge in Shiba Inu USD spot trading volume on Kraken over the last seven days. There has also been a significant surge on other major exchanges, such as Binance, Bybit, OKX, and Gemini, during the same period. This indicates that spot buyers may be stepping in to defend the SHIB price at a critical support amid the broader crypto market decline. Related Reading: Will A Shiba Inu ETF Follow After Dogecoin? The Lone SHIB Filing Standing Against The Crowd Notably, Shiba Inu is one of the altcoins that are in the green over the last week, suggesting that the bulls may be in control at the moment. CoinMarketCap data shows that the second-largest meme coin by market cap is up almost 7% during this period despite Bitcoin’s choppy price action. Meanwhile, further data from CoinGlass also shows that most leverage traders are currently betting on an increase in the Shiba Inu price, with the long/short ratio currently above 1. However, it is worth noting that derivatives volume is down by over 10% and open interest is down by almost 4%, which presents a bearish outlook for the meme coin. Another positive for Shiba Inu, besides the surge in spot trading volume, is that the Fed is likely to cut interest rates again at this week’s FOMC meeting. This could inject more liquidity into the crypto market, with altcoins like SHIB benefiting from it. Meanwhile, Bitcoin is currently looking to hold above the psychological $90,000 level, which could pave the way for higher prices for SHIB given their positive correlation. Community Gives Update On SHIB’s Progress In an X post, Shiba Inu community member Shibizens gave an update on SHIB’s progress over the last few days. The community member noted that over 45 billion SHIB have been moved off exchanges, indicating that holders are accumulating. Shibizens also alluded to a $35 million whale transfer into a private wallet, suggesting that SHIB whales are also bullish. Related Reading: Will The Shiba Inu Price Hit A New All-Time High In 2025? Machine Learning Algorithm Answers Furthermore, Coinbase is set to launch Shiba Inu futures on December 12 for institutional and retail investors, which could boost the meme coin’s adoption. Meanwhile, NYSE Arca has filed the 19b-4 for T. Rowe’s Shiba Inu ETF, bringing the ETF one step closer to launch. Shibuzens also highlighted upgrades on the Shibarium network, which could provide a major boost for SHIB. This includes the RPC upgrade, while a full privacy upgrade has been confirmed using encrypted tech. There are plans to roll this out by next year. At the time of writing, the Shiba Inu price is trading at around $0.000008498, up in the last 24 hours, according to data from CoinMarketCap.

Roxom will offer direct stock trading for BTC holders without the need for fiat ramps. Holders will be able to trade BTC directly for the shares in treasury companies. The Roxom capital market will roll out its new trading product worldwide, currently in the waiting list stage. “ For Bitcoiners who want to accumulate more BTC, treasury-focused equities have become an important part of the investment landscape. Roxom finally brings all these companies into one place: with every metric, price and signal denominated in Bitcoin. You can now invest, monitor and measure everything in BTC, without relying on fiat or traditional brokers,” said Borja Martel Seward, co-founder and CEO of Roxom. The shares of treasury companies are usually more volatile compared to BTC, but people still look at them because they may offer more significant upside. Short-term trading is also a possibility, especially when seeking to make a bet on a directional move. Roxom plans to offer global access to BTC-based trading Global access to stock trading is also one of the perks of a fully crypto-based platform. The new product is part of Roxom’s plan to build financial infrastructure with BTC at its core. The company plans to launch spot and derivative markets for global equity, as well as commodity benchmarks. To educate the public, Roxom also plans to launch a 24/7 BTC-focused media network targeting investors and traders. The shares of treasury companies, especially MSTR , are widely traded and held by mainstream investors, both retail and institutional. Access for crypto natives is still limited and fragmented, offering various forms of tokenization. Roxom already has experience with its first BTC-denominated market product, launched in October 2025. The company offered BTC-denominated benchmarks, including the S&P500 and gold. Roxom taps BTC performance against traditional assets The product allowed traders to directly settle in cryptocurrency through the S&P 500/BTC and Gold/BTC pairs. The trade is more direct, saving on fees, especially when making a bet on the performance of BTC against traditional assets. Roxom has started its efforts with $17.9M in new funding from Draper Associates, Borderless Capital, Ego Death Capital, and Kingsway Capital. In total, the company relies on $22.2M from two funding rounds in 2024 and 2025. The ambitious goal of Roxom is to become the capital market platform for a Bitcoin-denominated world. The company offers regulated infrastructure and 24/7 trading, attracting crypto natives who are used to continuous settlement. Roxom already tracks the available data on treasury companies.

Price remains below all major EMAs, locking the asset in a bearish structure. Derivatives participation thins despite an options volume spike. By Parshwa Turakhiya Dogecoin ( DOGE-USD ) traded near $0.1407 on Tuesday after another session defined by steady outflows and a lack of meaningful accumulation. The latest spot-flow reading showed $4.81 million in net outflows, reinforcing a multi-month trend where sellers dominate every bounce. Dogecoin’s drop reflects ongoing structural weakness in both spot demand and derivatives positioning. The asset has been unable to sustain momentum since peaking in September, and each recovery attempt has been used for distribution rather than accumulation. The persistent outflow pattern underscores why rallies fade quickly and why overhead supply continues to build. EMAs continue to cap every attempt at recovery The daily chart shows DOGE firmly pinned beneath all major EMAs. The 20-day EMA at $0.1476 has acted as dynamic resistance for nearly six straight weeks, rejecting every short-lived rebound. The 50-day EMA at $0.1649 and the 100-day EMA at $0.1836 add layers of heavier supply above, while the 200-day EMA at $0.1975 has not been tested in months. DOGE price analysis (Source: TradingView) This alignment is a classic bearish stack. Until price reclaims at least the 20-day and 50-day EMAs, discussions of trend exhaustion remain premature. RSI near 41 reinforces this view. The oscillator’s behavior points to weak momentum rather than capitulation, suggesting the market is grinding lower without a meaningful impulse from buyers. Derivatives flows thin as traders step back Futures data show participation continues to fade. Open interest slipped 0.41 percent and total volume fell nearly 10 percent, a combination that signals disengagement rather than directional positioning. Long/short ratios still show retail optimism - with Binance at 2.27 and OKX at 3.25 - but this optimism has yet to produce measurable price traction. Options activity was the lone standout. A 103 percent jump in options volume highlights renewed volatility interest, but open interest barely moved. The shift likely reflects an adjustment of short-dated structures rather than strategic positioning for a larger trend reversal. DOGE’s liquidity profile adds further complications. Open interest sits near $1.36 billion, far below the levels seen in earlier cycles. This thinning liquidity environment amplifies risk. Breakdowns tend to move faster, and rallies struggle to extend because fresh capital is not entering the market. Intraday trend stays fragile as resistance tightens The 30-minute chart shows how quickly each recovery attempt has been rejected. After an early-session rebound, the Supertrend flipped bearish again while SAR dots remained above price. Every rally stalled precisely near $0.142-0.143, a band now serving as the intraday ceiling. Until DOGE closes above that level with conviction, any bounce will carry more characteristics of a technical reaction than a shift in market structure. Support sits at $0.138-0.139, an area tested multiple times throughout the day. A breakdown leaves the late-November liquidity pocket near $0.132 as the next target. On the upside, reclaiming the 20-day EMA at $0.1476 is the minimum requirement for trend relief. A stronger reversal would need a breakout above the 50-day EMA at $0.1649, which marks the midpoint of the multi-month decline. Dogecoin is not collapsing, but it remains in a persistent downtrend reinforced by a lack of fresh inflows, thinning derivatives participation and a durable overhead EMA wall. As long as spot buyers remain absent, each rally is likely to function as an exit rather than an entry opportunity. In earlier coverage, we outlined the $0.147–$0.165 band as the decisive resistance cluster governing DOGE’s trend. That cluster continues to behave as a hard ceiling, keeping momentum suppressed and reducing the likelihood of a sustained upside move unless inflows return.

In under four weeks, the new U.S. spot ETF surpassed $1 billion in assets under management (AUM). This achievement makes it the fastest crypto spot ETF to reach that milestone in the U.S. since Ethereum. The rapid inflows highlight growing institutional and retail interest in regulated crypto products. Brad Garlinghouse, Ripple’s CEO, confirmed that this surge reflects “pent‑up demand” from investors seeking safe, regulated exposure to cryptocurrency. With firms like Vanguard opening retirement and brokerage accounts to these ETFs , millions of Americans can now invest in crypto without technical expertise. Investors no longer need to manage wallets or private keys to access digital assets. A Record-Breaking Launch The XRP spot ETF debuted in mid-November 2025 and immediately attracted significant capital. Over a 15-day streak, roughly $897 million flowed into the fund , according to a recent report. With over 40 crypto ETFs launched this year in the US alone, a few points are obvious to me: 1/ there’s pent up demand for regulated crypto products, and with Vanguard opening up… — Brad Garlinghouse (@bgarlinghouse) December 8, 2025 Leading institutional investors, including Canary Capital, Grayscale, Bitwise, and Franklin Templeton, contributed heavily. Such participation underscores confidence in XRP’s market structure and long-term viability. The surge also impacted XRP’s circulating supply. Over 400 million XRP tokens are now locked in institutional vaults, potentially tightening liquidity. This structural shift may influence price stability and market dynamics over the coming months. Why This ETF Matters Two key trends explain XRP’s ETF success. First, regulated products are increasingly preferred by investors who value compliance and transparency. Garlinghouse emphasized that many new participants are uninterested in blockchain technicalities but still want crypto exposure. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Second, the rise of “off‑chain” crypto holders has reshaped investor profiles. These individuals prioritize longevity, stability, and community over direct network interaction. For them, a regulated ETF provides a simple, secure bridge between traditional finance and digital assets. Implications for the Crypto Market XRP’s rapid ETF adoption signals a broader shift in institutional crypto investment. Regulated, transparent products may dominate inflows, even for altcoins traditionally considered niche. Outpacing most altcoin funds, XRP’s milestone sends a strong signal to pension funds, asset managers, and mainstream investors. For XRP, the ETF could stabilize investor behavior. As more capital flows through regulated vehicles, liquidity tightens, and price discovery becomes more influenced by institutional sentiment than speculative trading. This evolution may support a more durable and engaged investor base. Brad Garlinghouse’s insights reveal that XRP’s rise is more than a headline. It marks a new phase in crypto adoption, where digital assets gain legitimacy and accessibility in mainstream finance. The $1 billion milestone could redefine how institutions and retail investors approach cryptocurrency in the U.S. Disclaimer : This content is meant to inform and should not be considered financial advice.

For the period, the platform recorded the highest-ever volume of user earnings, and the total number of active participants continued to grow rapidly against the backdrop of high MEV pool activity. Record November Payouts According to Mevolaxy’s internal statistics, the total volume of user accruals exceeded all previous months, marking the best result since the platform’s launch. The growth is attributed to: An increase in the volume of liquidity within the system, Improvements to the MEV bot algorithms, enabling them to process a larger volume of on-chain traffic, A growing share of users who have upgraded to Pro plans. November demonstrated that, even amidst high cryptocurrency market volatility, the mevstake mechanism remains resilient because its yield is not tied to asset price appreciation but is generated by network activity. Another significant news of the month was the strategic funding secured from the private analytical fund Helios Capital Research – an independent US-based entity specializing in supporting DeFi projects. The fund highlighted three key reasons for its decision to invest in Mevolaxy: A resilient business model derived from on-chain operations. Ownership of its proprietary technology stack instead of relying on third-party solutions. Rapid user base growth, confirming strong product-market fit. The investment amount totaled $4 million, with Helios Capital Research representatives naming Mevolaxy “one of the most promising platforms in the DeFi segment for the next 2-3 years.” The Mevolaxy team emphasizes that attracting institutional capital of this caliber enhances the project’s stability and accelerates the implementation of key initiatives: from expanding the MEV pool network to developing mobile solutions and scaling infrastructure. The deal with Helios Capital Research stands as an important validation that the mevstake model being built by Mevolaxy is in demand not only among retail users but also among professional crypto market participants. The company states that it will continue to strengthen the ecosystem, expand functionality, and work on transparency and technological reliability to make mevstake one of the key tools for stable income in the DeFi world.

CONY’s strategy leverages synthetic options on Coinbase (COIN), generating high yields but capping upside and amplifying volatility exposure tied to Bitcoin. Total return since inception is positive for early entrants, but recent investors face a 34.5% total loss over twelve months despite a 126.4% yield. Distributions are primarily return of capital, offering tax efficiency, but principal erosion and declining payouts post-reverse split limit long-term appeal. Overview I've covered a ton of different YieldMax funds in the past, but YieldMax COIN Option Income Strategy ETF ( CONY ) is unique to me because it's the first high-yield income ETF I initiated a position in more than a year ago. When I previously covered CONY, I issued a hold rating due to the mixed performance and uncertainty around the volatility of Coinbase ( COIN ) at the time. Since my last coverage, CONY has implemented a 1:10 reverse split to reset the price deterioration that occurred. Therefore, I wanted to revisit the ETF to reassess its performance, income potential, and risk post-split. The appeal of the fund can ultimately depend on an investor's specific risk tolerance and circumstance. Looking at the performance over the last twelve months, we can see that CONY's share price has eroded by more than 74.7%. Despite its high distributions, the total return still sits at a loss of 34.5% over the same time frame. CONY now offers investors a massive estimated annual distribution rate of 126.4%. Since the time of my last coverage, the payout frequency has shifted to a weekly cadence. While this may increase the appeal for income investors, investors that were holding pre-split are likely to see much lower levels of income over time. Data by YCharts While I still maintain a hold rating on CONY, there is a caveat to this rating. I believe that the appeal of maintaining a position is entirely dependent on how long an investor has been holding shares. Despite the massive deterioration of the share price, I am still in a positive return territory and now achieved house money status. However, this is a lot easier to achieve when market indices and Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) are trending upward. So let's start by taking a look at the underlying strategy that CONY implements to generate its earnings. Fund Strategy According to the latest fund overview , CONY now has total net assets of $847.5M. This is a large pullback from the fund's peak total assets under management of $1.5B only a few months ago. This can be a reflection of the fund's poor performance and investor's funneling money elsewhere. However, CONY is unique because it aims to mimic the underlying share price of Coinbase. However, Coinbase continues to parallel the daily price change in Bitcoin. At the time of my last coverage, Bitcoin was trading near its all-time highs above $120K. Since then, the price has pulled back to around $90K, so Coinbase followed the same momentum during the decline. Data by YCharts Therefore, CONY can present a lot more volatility than some YieldMax peers that track companies without any crypto exposure. Additionally, the fund implements a synthetic option writing strategy to get exposure to COIN, while harnessing its volatility to collect large option premiums to fuel distributions. However, the term synthetic refers to the fact that CONY doesn't actually own any of the underlying common shares of COIN. Therefore, the fund is writing options against an asset that it doesn't actually own, which increases the overall risk profile in terms of price stability through volatile markets. As we can see in the holdings below, CONY is primarily made up of U.S Treasury bills. Additionally, we can see below that there are several active call options at this time with varying expiration dates and strike prices. COIN US - 01/16/2026 C$280 COIN US - 12/19/2025 C$260 COIN CCL OPT 12/25 290 YieldMax If you aren't familiar with the process, the inclusion of an option writing strategy means that CONY will only be able to partially participate in the upside movement of COIN. This is because the upside growth is capped to whatever the selected strike price is. For instance, CONY has an active option with a strike price of $280 per share. If COIN sees its price run up to $300 per share before the expiration date, CONY would only be able to capture the price growth up to the $280 strike price, which essentially means that the remaining upside is sacrificed for the income generation that can be collected now. So if you are bullish on Coinbase, it's much better to simply hold the underlying. Performance Insight & Risks Despite the consistent share price deterioration, CONY has still managed to provide an attractive total return since its inception. As we can see below, the fund's share price has declined by over 76.4%. These massive losses have been offset by the distributions, which brings the total return up to slightly over 92% over the same time frame. However, the total return can significantly shift based on when you initiated your position so timing is very important with these ETFs. Data by YCharts For instance, I've held a position close to the fund's inception and I've now reached house money status. I consider this to be the point where you've collected more than your initial investment amount in distributions. So if you invest $10,000, house money status is when you've collected $10,000 in distributions and collected back your initial investment, which significantly reduces your risk at that point going forward. After closely measuring how these YieldMax funds operate, I believe that its performance and outlook can be summarized in three different scenarios, as follows: Coinbase Price Rises = CONY likely to see minimal upside and distributions will remain consistent. However, distributions may be large, which may cause the share price to remain flat, rather than show any growth. Coinbase Price Trades Choppy/Flat = CONY's share price may slowly trend downward, but distributions may be high due to volatility. This can lead to CONY outperforming COIN during a period of choppiness and may present the most favorable conditions for CONY. Coinbase Price Declines = CONY will suffer from share price erosion and payouts may trend downward, depending on how severe of a downside movement takes place. CONY will struggle to recover from this downside and underperformance is likely to deepen. After holding over a dozen of these YieldMax funds, I now consider some of them to be self-liquidating funds, but this is somewhat by design. This simply means that the large yields are unsustainable so NAV erosion and share price deterioration is ultimately inevitable. So once again, this is why timing on the entry is very important. This sort of vulnerability also means that investors are likely required to commit to a long term position so that the distributions can eventually offset the share price erosion. I recommend that investors meticulously track their performance in a spreadsheet by measuring the share price decline versus all distributions received, in order to get a clearer picture of the fund's actual performance and total return. Additionally, CONY is very likely to continue underperforming Coinbase over the long-term, so if you are bullish on the underlying it makes more sense to just hold COIN. Data by YCharts As we can see below, Coinbase's price closely mirrors the shifts in Bitcoin. Although Bitcoin has pulled back from its all-time highs, it wouldn't be unusual to see another large decline at some point. However, it may make sense to add some shares of CONY here now that Bitcoin has pulled back from its highs and seems to be hovering around $90K now. Data by YCharts Lower Payouts Post-Split As of the latest declared weekly distribution of $1.1311 per share, the current dividend yield sits around 126.4%. While the split doesn't actually change anything from a yield perspective, shareholders that have been maintaining a position since before the split are likely to see their income slowly decline over time. Even though the reverse split appeared to reset the price, it doesn't restore that value that you've already lost. Since your underlying principal is smaller, the dollars you receive now will be lower than when you first started your position. Therefore, CONY can be a tricky fund because if you want to keep all distribution amounts within a tight range, it may require active reinvesting of those distributions to accumulate more shares. Additionally, the fund's payouts continue to trend downward as the underlying NAV declines and the share price erodes. Unfortunately, I think we have already passed the golden era for entry, which was when Bitcoin was rapidly increasing and breaking new highs every week. As bitcoin rose, so did the share price of COIN. Now that the cycle seems to have shifted, the appeal is limited. Seeking Alpha When looking at the breakdown of the distributions, CONY seems to prioritize return of capital payouts. As we can see below, the latest payout was made up of 96.76% return of capital distributions, which are more tax-efficient. This is because return of capital distributions aren't classified as income and therefore, aren't taxed as such. Instead, return of capital distributions reduce an investor's cost basis and allows taxes to be deferred until the time of sale. So on a more positive note, although the share price has consistently eroded, investors have the potential to collect income with a limited tax consequence. YieldMax However, it's also important to note that some of these tax-efficient distributions don't necessarily equate to all the income being tax-free. The makeup of payouts can shift every week and a portion of the distribution can be fueled by net investment income. Distributions supported by net investment income are typically classified as ordinary dividends, which have the greatest tax burden for investors. Takeaway In conclusion, I maintain a hold rating on CONY at this time. However, the caveat is that holding shares through the possibility of further declines can be easily digested by investors that have already achieved house money status. While I am not pleased with the share price erosion of the fund, this has taken place by the design. The large distributions are simply unsustainable and requires investors to time their entry or maintain a long term position so that distributions can eventually outpace the declines. Therefore, this is a high risk/high reward fund that remains vulnerable to a larger pullback in the price of Bitcoin. On a positive note, at least the distributions seem to primarily be made up of return of capital, which are more tax-efficient for long-term investors.",COIN|CONY,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|EXCHANGE|TRADING|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Seeking Alpha', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/seekingalpha.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",seekingalpha,2025-12-09 16:06:34

The Fear and Greed Index now prints 25, placing sentiment inside the fear band without dipping back into extreme readings. Bitcoin is trading a little above $90,000 with a small recovery from earlier lows, and the market continues to behave as though it is still sorting through recent losses rather than preparing for a broad turn in risk appetite. Within that restrained environment, only a few altcoins are showing clear strength. Zcash, MemeCore, and Cardano are moving higher while the majority of large caps remain muted. Their performance offers a narrow window into how traders position themselves when the wider market hesitates but does not fully retreat. Fear and Greed Index (Source: CoinMarketCap) Zcash Shows Its First Meaningful Bounce After Heavy Losses Zcash (ZEC) is now trading around $426 , up by about 10% in 24 hours, and its rise stands out because the token fell sharply from a peak near $700 in November before losing close to 30% across the month. Trading data today shows firmer depth and a pickup in spot volume across several venues, which indicates that market participants are revisiting liquid privacy names now that the steepest part of the decline has passed. The rebound still leaves ZEC far from last month’s high, yet the current structure looks steadier than earlier attempts at recovery. Activity is spread across several markets rather than concentrated in narrow windows, which suggests a more stable footing for the token as sentiment steadies around the mid-twenty fear readings. MemeCore Advances On Continued Community Activity MemeCore (M) is trading near $1.34, up by about 9% in 24 hours. The move follows a period where engagement inside its community continued even during last week’s extreme fear conditions. MemeCore Price (Source: CoinMarketCap) Trading screens show stable liquidity on its active pairs, and on-chain usage linked to staking and social features remains visible enough to support small bursts of momentum whenever market pressure slows. The rise today appears tied to that ongoing participation instead of a single driver. MemeCore has tended to perform best when traders look for tokens supported by active user bases rather than one-off events. Cardano Edges Higher With Large Cap Rotation Cardano (ADA) is trading near $0.45, up by about 3% in 24 hours. The growth is modest but aligns with behavior seen across other large caps in recent sessions, where liquidity remains firm and flows turn balanced once Bitcoin stabilizes.

Apply by 4 January: https://t.co/5mkP8cv1TJ — Cardano Foundation (@Cardano_CF) December 8, 2025 Trading volumes today show measured participation rather than strong accumulation, yet ADA continues to benefit from being one of the more established networks during risk-averse periods. Cardano’s move does not alter its longer trend, but it illustrates how stable large caps often move first when markets pause after declines. Altcoin Season Still Out Of Reach Despite Small Pockets Of Strength The overall picture still leans toward caution . A fear reading of 25, Bitcoin holding just above $90,000, and limited rotation across major assets all point to a market that has not regained the breadth usually associated with altcoin season. The advances in Zcash, MemeCore, and Cardano show that selective interest persists, but the gains remain narrowly concentrated and depend heavily on liquidity and existing user activity rather than broad enthusiasm. For now, altcoin season sits at a distance, with only small pockets of momentum taking shape while sentiment remains anchored in the lower bands of the fear index.

This is no longer a hypothetical scenario. In a landmark clarification, the U.S. Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) has confirmed that national banks can indeed engage in risk-less principal crypto trades . This pivotal move bridges traditional finance and the digital asset world, providing a clear, regulated path for banks to participate. Let’s explore what this means for the future of crypto. What Are Risk-Less Principal Crypto Trades? The OCC’s confirmation centers on a specific and crucial activity: acting as a risk-less principal. But what does that actually mean? In simple terms, a bank can now match a buyer and a seller for a cryptocurrency transaction almost simultaneously. The bank acts as the middleman or broker, facilitating the trade without holding the cryptocurrency on its own balance sheet. Therefore, it does not take on the price risk associated with owning the asset. This model is a familiar one in traditional securities trading, and its application to crypto is a significant step toward mainstream integration. Why Is This OCC Guidance a Big Deal for Crypto? This clarification removes a major point of uncertainty for banks. Previously, the regulatory landscape for banks dealing in crypto was murky. The OCC’s letter provides a sanctioned framework, allowing banks to offer crypto services to customers with clearer guardrails. The benefits are substantial: Reduced Risk for Banks: By not holding crypto assets, banks avoid direct exposure to the market’s famous volatility. Increased Consumer Access: Customers gain a trusted, familiar institution through which to access crypto markets. Enhanced Market Legitimacy: Formal banking involvement lends further credibility to the entire cryptocurrency ecosystem. Improved Liquidity and Efficiency: Banks can help create more orderly and liquid markets by connecting buyers and sellers. How Do Risk-Less Principal Transactions Work in Practice? Let’s walk through a practical example. Suppose a customer wants to purchase Ethereum. The bank would find a corresponding seller for the same amount. It then executes two back-to-back trades: buying from the seller and selling to the buyer. The bank’s role is purely facilitative; it profits from a fee or spread, not from speculating on Ethereum’s price movement. This process requires robust technology and compliance systems to ensure prompt matching and settlement, but it fundamentally changes the risk profile for the bank compared to acting as a market maker with its own capital. What Challenges and Considerations Remain? While the green light is significant, it’s not a free pass. Banks must still navigate considerable challenges. They need to implement stringent Anti-Money Laundering (AML) and Know Your Customer (KYC) protocols tailored to crypto transactions. Cybersecurity is paramount, as is ensuring the technological infrastructure for trading and custody (even if indirect) is ironclad. Furthermore, this is specifically for risk-less principal crypto trades ; other activities, like proprietary trading or offering custody services, fall under different regulatory scrutiny. Banks must proceed with careful planning and robust internal controls. The Future of Banking and Cryptocurrency This OCC action is a clear signal. It demonstrates a regulatory willingness to integrate cryptocurrency into the existing financial system thoughtfully. We can expect more banks to cautiously explore offering crypto brokerage services, starting with large institutional clients before potentially moving to retail. This evolution could lead to more stable crypto markets and broader adoption, as the trust associated with regulated banks lowers the barrier to entry for many. Conclusion: A Secure Bridge is Built The OCC’s confirmation that banks can act as risk-less principals is a foundational moment. It constructs a secure regulatory bridge between the traditional banking world and the innovative realm of digital assets. By allowing banks to facilitate risk-less principal crypto trades , regulators are fostering an environment where institutional participation can grow responsibly. This move doesn’t eliminate risk from crypto, but it smartly reallocates it, paving the way for a more mature and accessible financial future. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q: Does this mean my bank will start selling Bitcoin tomorrow? A: Not immediately. The OCC provided permission, but each bank must build the compliance and technical systems to offer this service. It will likely roll out gradually. Q: Is my money safer buying crypto through a bank now? A> Using a bank as a broker for a risk-less principal crypto trade may feel safer due to the bank’s existing regulatory oversight and security standards. However, the underlying cryptocurrency asset still carries its own market risk. Q: Can banks now hold Bitcoin on their balance sheets? A> No. This guidance specifically covers acting as a matched principal or broker. Holding crypto as an asset is a separate activity with different regulatory requirements. Q: Will this make cryptocurrency prices less volatile? A> Increased institutional participation through regulated channels like banks could bring more stability and liquidity to crypto markets over the long term, but short-term volatility will likely remain. Q: What is the difference between a risk-less principal and a market maker? A> A risk-less principal matches orders without using its own capital, while a market maker uses its own capital to buy and sell assets, holding inventory and taking on significant price risk.

Together, the bank’s partnership with Coinbase and the repeat of a 2021-style double-top pattern frame a market where Wall Street access is widening even as technicals hint at one more big swing before the next downturn. PNC Launches Direct Bitcoin Trading Through Coinbase Partnership PNC Bank opened direct Bitcoin trading for its private-bank clients today, becoming the first major U.S. bank to place spot BTC buying and selling inside its own platform. The bank switched on the feature on December 9, using Coinbase’s Crypto-as-a-Service infrastructure to route trades and handle custody. PNC said the rollout gives eligible clients a way to buy, sell and hold Bitcoin without leaving the bank’s digital environment. The service sits inside PNC’s existing private-bank dashboard, so users can move between traditional accounts and Bitcoin balances in one place. The bank confirmed that Coinbase powers the trading engine on the back end. The move follows a partnership the two companies announced earlier this year. At the time, PNC said it wanted to build crypto tools directly into its wealth-management business. Today’s launch marks the first major U.S. bank to offer this type of direct spot Bitcoin access rather than only ETFs or third-party referrals. Bitcoin Repeats a 2021 Pattern as Chart Shows Double-Top and Bounce Meanwhile, Bitcoin is tracing a structure that closely resembles its 2021 cycle, according to fresh weekly-chart analysis from market watcher Ted Pillows. His chart shows two rounded tops forming near record levels, followed by a sharp pullback and a quick rebound from support. The pattern mirrors the double-top sequence that shaped the market in late 2021 before the deeper decline of 2022. Bitcoin Double Top Pattern. Source: TedPillows The chart highlights how price recovered from the first drop and pushed back toward the prior peak. The same behavior appears on the current weekly candles, with Bitcoin bouncing from the mid-$80,000 support zone after a steep slide from the highs near $128,000. Ted notes that this rebound fits the same rhythm Bitcoin showed three years ago, when a brief rally followed the initial downturn. He added that the repeated structure leaves room for one more push higher. His chart marks a potential path toward the $100,000 to $105,000 range before momentum fades again. The analysis points to the same shaded support area acting as the pivot in both cycles. In 2021, that level held once more before sellers regained control and drove price into the following year’s decline.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,BTC|FIAT|MARKET|TRADING|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-12-09 17:06:07

This decision by one of the world’s largest cryptocurrency exchanges signals a major step toward solving one of blockchain’s most persistent challenges: fragmentation. For millions of Coinbase users, accessing Hyperlane (HYPER) just became remarkably simple. What is Hyperlane and Why Does the Coinbase Listing Matter? Hyperlane is not just another token; it’s the fuel for a critical piece of infrastructure. Think of it as the postal service for the blockchain world. The protocol allows different blockchains—like Ethereum, Arbitrum, or Polygon—to communicate and share data securely. Before Hyperlane , moving assets or information between these separate networks was often slow, expensive, and complex. The Coinbase Hyperlane listing brings this essential technology directly to a mainstream audience. How Will This Benefit the Average Crypto User? You might wonder, ‘What’s in it for me?’ The answer lies in seamless experience. The integration of HYPER on Coinbase means users can now easily tap into a unified multi-chain world. Here are the immediate benefits: Simplified Access: Buy, sell, and hold HYPER directly with USD or other major cryptocurrencies on a trusted platform. Enhanced Utility: Users can participate in the interoperability economy, potentially using HYPER to pay for cross-chain messages or govern the protocol. Increased Visibility: A Coinbase listing provides immense legitimacy and exposes Hyperlane’s technology to millions of potential new adopters. What Challenges Does Hyperlane Solve for the Blockchain Industry? The crypto space is booming with innovation, but it has created a landscape of isolated ‘islands.’ Each new blockchain has its own rules, assets, and applications. This siloed structure limits growth and creates a poor user experience. Hyperlane acts as the bridge between these islands. Therefore, developers can build applications that work across any chain, and users can interact with multiple ecosystems from a single wallet. The Coinbase endorsement validates that this interoperability is not a niche concern but a core requirement for the future. What Are the Actionable Insights for Investors and Builders? For investors, the Coinbase Hyperlane news is a key development to watch. Exchange listings often correlate with increased liquidity and trading volume. More importantly, it highlights projects solving fundamental infrastructure problems. For developers and builders, this is a call to explore. With HYPER more accessible, building cross-chain applications becomes a more viable and supported path. The barrier to using interoperability tools is now significantly lower. The Compelling Future of a Connected Crypto World Coinbase’s decision to list Hyperlane (HYPER) is a powerful signal. It moves interoperability from a technical backend topic to a front-and-center feature for the next wave of users. This listing is more than just adding another asset; it’s about providing the tools for a cohesive digital future. As blockchains learn to communicate freely, we can expect a surge in innovative applications that are truly chain-agnostic, making the user experience smoother and more powerful than ever before. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q: When will Hyperlane (HYPER) be available for trading on Coinbase? A: Coinbase typically announces specific trading dates shortly after the initial listing announcement. Users should check the official Coinbase Assets page or blog for the exact launch timeline. Q: What can I use the HYPER token for? A: The HYPER token is primarily used to secure the Hyperlane network through staking and to pay for cross-chain messaging fees. It also likely serves a governance function, allowing holders to vote on protocol upgrades. Q: Is Hyperlane only for developers? A: While developers use it to build apps, end-users benefit massively. Any application built with Hyperlane allows you to interact with multiple blockchains seamlessly, often without you even realizing which chain you’re on. Q: How does this listing affect the price of HYPER? A: While we don’t provide financial advice, a Coinbase listing generally increases accessibility and demand, which can impact market dynamics. However, cryptocurrency prices are volatile and depend on many factors. Q: Can I stake HYPER on Coinbase? A: Staking functionality depends on Coinbase’s product offerings. Initially, expect spot trading. Staking or earning rewards may be introduced later if Coinbase supports it for HYPER. Q: What makes Hyperlane different from other interoperability projects? A> Hyperlane emphasizes ‘permissionless interoperability,’ meaning any developer can connect any blockchain without needing approval, aiming for greater neutrality and flexibility compared to some other bridge solutions.

In a dramatic display of volatility, exchanges reported a staggering $122 million worth of futures liquidated in a single 60-minute window. This intense pressure wave, part of a larger $374 million in liquidations over 24 hours, serves as a stark reminder of the high-stakes, high-risk nature of leveraged crypto trading. What triggered this cascade, and what crucial lessons can traders learn from this event? What Does $122 Million in Futures Liquidated Actually Mean? When we talk about futures being liquidated, we’re referring to the forced closure of leveraged trading positions. Traders use borrowed funds to amplify their bets on price movements. However, if the market moves against them too sharply, their collateral becomes insufficient, and the exchange automatically sells their position to prevent further loss. This hour saw $122 million worth of futures liquidated , meaning a massive amount of leveraged capital was wiped out almost instantly. This creates a domino effect, as these forced sales can push prices down further, triggering even more liquidations. Why Do These Massive Liquidation Events Happen? Liquidation cascades are often the product of a perfect storm. A sudden, sharp price movement in a major asset like Bitcoin or Ethereum is usually the catalyst. This can be triggered by: Unexpected News: Regulatory announcements or major macroeconomic data. Large Whale Movements: A single entity selling a huge position. Technical Breakdowns: The price falling through a key support level where many stop-loss orders are clustered. In this case, the rapid futures liquidated total suggests the market hit a critical leverage ratio, causing a chain reaction. The 24-hour total of $374 million highlights that this wasn’t an isolated spike but part of a sustained period of high volatility and pressure on leveraged positions. Who Gets Hit When Futures Are Liquidated? The pain from these events isn’t distributed evenly. Typically, the traders most affected are those using high leverage with poor risk management. Imagine a trader using 10x leverage; a mere 10% move against their position would wipe out their entire collateral. The recent $122 million worth of futures liquidated likely represents thousands of individual trades gone wrong. The data often shows whether long positions (bets on price increases) or short positions (bets on decreases) bore the brunt, giving insight into market sentiment and the direction of the price shock. How Can Traders Protect Themselves from Liquidation? Surviving and thriving in volatile markets requires discipline. Here are actionable steps to avoid becoming a liquidation statistic: Use Lower Leverage: High leverage is a double-edged sword. Using 3x-5x instead of 10x or more gives the market more room to breathe. Set Strict Stop-Losses: Define your maximum loss before entering a trade and stick to it automatically. Never Over-allocate: Only risk a small percentage of your total capital on any single leveraged trade. Monitor Funding Rates: Extremely high funding rates can be a warning sign of overcrowded leverage. Remember, the goal is to manage risk, not just chase profit. The spectacle of millions in futures liquidated is a powerful, real-time lesson in why this principle is paramount. What Does This Mean for the Overall Crypto Market? While alarming, large liquidation events are a natural part of market cycles. They effectively “reset” excessive leverage, removing unstable positions and potentially creating a healthier foundation for the next move. However, they also induce fear and can lead to short-term price depression. For long-term investors, these volatility spikes underscore the importance of a solid strategy based on fundamentals, not margin calls. Watching the scale of futures liquidated can serve as a valuable gauge of market sentiment and leverage extremes. In conclusion, the $122 million worth of futures liquidated in one hour is more than just a headline number. It is a vivid case study in market mechanics, risk, and trader psychology. Such events wash out weak hands, test the resolve of holders, and provide sobering education on the perils of unchecked greed and leverage. The market’s relentless nature demands respect, preparation, and above all, prudent risk management to navigate its inevitable storms. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) What causes a futures liquidation? A futures liquidation occurs when a trader’s leveraged position loses enough value that their remaining collateral can no longer cover the potential loss. The exchange then forcibly closes the position to limit its own risk. Is $122 million a large amount for crypto liquidations? Yes, $122 million in one hour is a significant liquidation event, indicating high market volatility and substantial use of leverage. It often signals a sharp, directional price move. Who benefits when futures are liquidated? Exchanges collect fees on the liquidated trades. Furthermore, traders on the opposite side of the market (e.g., shorts if longs are liquidated) may profit from the downward price pressure caused by the forced selling. Can I get my money back after a liquidation? No. Once a position is liquidated, the lost collateral is gone. The process is automatic and irreversible, designed to prevent losses from exceeding the initial margin. How can I check live liquidation data? Websites like Coinglass or Bybit provide real-time liquidation heatmaps and totals across major exchanges, showing amounts for both long and short positions. Do liquidations only happen in crypto? No, liquidations are a feature of all leveraged markets, including traditional commodities and stock futures. However, the 24/7 nature and high volatility of crypto can make them more frequent and dramatic. Found this breakdown of the recent futures liquidated volatility helpful?

According to Saylor, six banks that were crypto skeptics have flipped to active participants in just 12 months, far ahead of the 4–8 year timeline experts once predicted. The Bitcoin evangelist explained that Citi, JPMorgan, Wells Fargo, BNY Mellon, Charles Schwab, and Bank of America have all entered the crypto lending market in the last six months alone. At the Binance Blockchain Week in Dubai, Saylor said that the top 10 US banks now facilitate crypto lending, up from zero in Q4 2024. This was driven by Basel III reforms that classified Bitcoin as a Tier 1 asset, as well as a rise in demand for BTC-backed credit facilities. According to data from a PwC report and Kaiko Research, $50 billion in new credit lines has been issued since September 2025. Banks captured 40% of the $150 billion annualized crypto lending market. Saylor emphasized lending as the “tipping point,” with banks offering loans at 50-70% loan-to-value (LTV) ratios on Bitcoin collateral at interest rates of 4-6%. This is lower than DeFi alternatives. JPMorgan leads in BTC-backed lending JPMorgan has been a leader in lending backed by BTC. CEO Jamie Dimon, once a Bitcoin skeptic, softened his stance on the crypto earlier this year. As reported by Cryptopolitan, the company launched a $10 billion credit facility against Bitcoin collateral in October. This extended its June 2025 policy, allowing clients to use spot Bitcoin ETFs (e.g., BlackRock’s IBIT) as collateral for loans across trading and wealth management. According to reports, the company has announced plans for potential 2026 direct lending against BTC/ETH. This facility exemplifies Saylor’s point on banks issuing USD loans at low rates against BTC. Wells Fargo joined the BTC lending wave in Q4 2025. It offers credit against Bitcoin ETFs and holdings following Basel III updates. It is now listed among the top banks facilitating crypto loans. Exploratory discussions on stablecoins have evolved into active BTC collateral programs. Saylor referenced Wells Fargo’s Q4 shift, noting it “followed suit” after JPMorgan’s facility, with internal blockchain tests upgraded for tokenized BTC deposits, enabling credit issuance. BNY Mellon expanded Bitcoin custody to include lending in Q4 2025, holding BTC for ETFs and issuing credit against it. According to reports, the bank issued trials of blockchain deposits for $2.5 trillion in payments, tokenizing BTC holdings for instant settlement and collateral use. According to Saylor, BNY’s ETF custody is a gateway to $50 billion in new credit lines. Citi, BOF, and Charles Schwab’s aggressive 2026 entry into BTC custody and credit Other banks have outlined their plans for next year. Citi is actively preparing to launch Bitcoin custody and lending services in 2026. A report made this month revealed Citi’s integration of CIDAP (Crypto Infrastructure for Digital Asset Platforms) to enable BTC-backed credit. Additionally, at the beginning of Q4, Citi’s global head of partnerships confirmed that the bank has spent 2-3 years developing in-house and third-party custody solutions for native crypto coins like Bitcoin, targeting asset managers. Bank of America will allow all of its affluent clients to invest 1% to 4% of their portfolios in crypto coins through Merrill and Private Bank, with an emphasis on Bitcoin ETFs as a collateralized form of investment, starting January 5, 2026. Charles Schwab announced an aggressive 2026 entry into BTC custody and credit. The bank is set up for spot Bitcoin/Ethereum trading, as well as stablecoin issuance. CEO Rick Wurster confirmed that the $11.8 trillion platform will offer direct BTC trading in H1 2026, with lending against holdings via integrated brokerage. Saylor called it a “major change” for 37 million accounts. Still, none of the six banks Michael Saylor mentioned hold Bitcoin or any other crypto coin directly on their own corporate balance sheets. US banking regulations and Basel III capital rules still make direct spot crypto ownership highly restrictive and capital-intensive for regulated banks. Get seen where it counts.

The rebound reflects growing expectations of a Federal Reserve rate cut this week, tempered by concerns that policymakers may signal a pause in further easing. The gains extended across the broader crypto market. Ethereum surged 8.54% to $3,374, outperforming major tokens. Solana and Dogecoin each advanced more than 6% to $143.91 and $0.15, respectively, while XRP rose 4.57% to $2.16. Heavy buy volume pushed the sector higher following weeks of volatility. Macro data support rate-cut bets Tuesday’s advance followed US economic data showing job openings holding steady at 7.7 million in October, surpassing expectations. The JOLTS report also recorded 5.1 million hires and 5.1 million separations, reinforcing the view of a gradually cooling labour market. Markets widely expect the Fed to cut its benchmark rate by 25 basis points on Wednesday, marking a third consecutive reduction. But both CME FedWatch and Polymarket data show rising odds that Fed Chair Jerome Powell will signal caution about additional cuts in early 2025. Investors are increasingly positioning for a scenario in which the central bank slows the pace of easing to manage inflation risks. Bitcoin struggles after sharp October drop Despite Tuesday’s rally, Bitcoin remains under pressure after a steep decline from its October record near $126,000. The cryptocurrency has slipped 2% year to date, leaving it on track for its weakest annual performance since the 2022 crypto winter, when it lost more than 64% of its value. Its divergence from equities has also widened. While the S&P 500 has gained 16% this year, Bitcoin has failed to participate in broader risk-on rallies, reflecting persistent volatility throughout 2025. The sector has endured multiple sharp swings. Following an initial surge driven by the election of President Donald Trump, crypto and equity markets plunged in April after his tariff announcements. Bitcoin later rebounded to an all-time high in early October, only to collapse again days later when Trump announced further tariffs and threatened export controls on critical software. The October sell-off triggered more than $19 billion in leveraged liquidations — the largest in crypto’s history. Strategists turn cautious Standard Chartered’s global head of digital assets, Geoff Kendrick, said in a Tuesday note titled “Not a crypto winter, just a cold breeze” that “recent price action in bitcoin (BTC) has been challenging, to say the least.” He cited the sharp collapse in the share values of digital-asset treasury companies (DATs) as a key reason for revising his outlook. Kendrick noted that one pillar of his earlier bullish forecast had been continued purchasing by these companies. Their steep share-price declines — many now trading below the value of the Bitcoin they hold — mean they are increasingly constrained in their ability to raise capital for additional purchases. “We expect a consolidation rather than outright selling, but DAT buying is unlikely to provide further support,” he said. With that shift, Kendrick wrote that the bull case now “rests solely with ETF buying.” He slashed his year-end price targets accordingly, reducing his 2025 forecast to $100,000 from $200,000, and lowering projections for subsequent years through 2028. His previously expected $500,000 target has been pushed out to 2030.

At the same time, Ethereum’s ratio against Bitcoin is breaking its downtrend, adding a second signal that rotation and volatility may soon pick up. ETHBTC Breaks Its Downtrend as Chart Shows First Clean Retest and Lift Ethereum’s ratio against Bitcoin is showing its clearest bullish structure in months after breaking out of the descending channel that shaped the entire autumn move. The chart from BitBull highlights how price pushed above the upper trendline for the first time, paused on a clean retest and then turned higher again. That sequence often signals a shift in momentum as sellers lose control of the range. ETHBTC Breakout Retest Pattern. Source: BitBull The breakout followed weeks of lower highs inside the channel. Each attempt to recover stalled under the same diagonal resistance until this week’s close pushed through it. That move set the stage for the retest, where ETHBTC dipped back toward the trendline but held the level instead of sliding beneath it. The candles in that zone stayed tight, showing that buyers continued to absorb pressure. Now the ratio is lifting off the retest area with a stronger push than earlier bounces. The candles forming above the trendline show the shift from defense to offense as the pair tries to build a higher structure. BitBull notes that this type of breakout–retest–continuation pattern often marks the early phase of a broader uptrend when market conditions support rotation into Ethereum. Bitcoin Liquidity Map Shows Heavy Cluster at 93K–94K While Price Stays Range-Bound Meanwhile, Bitcoin’s latest liquidity heatmap points to a dense cluster of resting orders between 93,000 and 94,000 dollars, according to data shared by Daan Crypto Trades. The CoinGlass map shows thick bands of liquidity in that zone, suggesting many leveraged positions and pending orders sit just above the current range. That area now stands out as the nearest pocket where a sharp move could trigger larger liquidations. Bitcoin Liquidity Heatmap 93K–94K Cluster. Source: Coinglass / Daan Crypto Trades Below the market, the chart flags 87,000 dollars as the next important band, although the liquidity there appears thinner. The stripes around that level are less intense, which means there is still interest but not the same concentration seen higher up. If price moves down, the 87,000 region remains a reference point, yet it does not show the same weight of clustered orders as the overhead block. Between these bands, Bitcoin continues to trade sideways, with candles sliding back and forth across the same intraday levels. The structure reflects a market that is still searching for direction while leverage builds around clear zones. As a result, traders watch the heatmap for confirmation of a breakout from the current range, since a decisive move into either cluster would likely release a new wave of volatility.",News|Bitcoin,EN,0,0,BTC|ETH|MARKET|TRADING|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-12-09 17:19:06

The Senate Banking Committee is poised to take a critical step next week by marking up a major crypto market structure bill . This procedural move signals serious legislative momentum and could set the stage for the most significant federal digital asset framework to date. What Does This Crypto Market Structure Bill Markup Mean? Senator Cynthia Lummis, a leading pro-crypto voice, confirmed the committee plans to hold the markup session before the Christmas recess. A markup is where committee members debate, amend, and ultimately shape legislation before it advances to the full Senate for a vote. Therefore, this session is where the real legislative crafting happens. The bill in question is the Responsible Financial Innovation Act , a comprehensive proposal that has been in development for years. Why Is This Legislation So Important? For years, the U.S. crypto industry has operated under a patchwork of state rules and evolving federal guidance, leading to significant uncertainty. This crypto market structure bill aims to change that by establishing clear federal guardrails. Its core mission is to protect consumers and foster innovation by answering fundamental questions that have plagued the space. The legislation tackles several key challenges head-on: Regulatory Clarity: It clearly defines which digital assets are securities (regulated by the SEC) and which are commodities (regulated by the CFTC). Consumer Protection: It sets standards for disclosures, custody, and trading practices. Innovation Pathway: It creates exemptions for certain decentralized projects from traditional securities registration, provided they meet specific conditions. What Are the Key Provisions to Watch? The bill’s most watched element is its attempt to draw a bright line between the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and the Commodities Futures Trading Commission (CFTC). Currently, jurisdictional disputes between these agencies create confusion for businesses. This crypto market structure bill would grant the CFTC explicit authority over digital asset commodities and spot markets. Moreover, another crucial provision could exempt cryptocurrencies that are sufficiently decentralized and functional from the registration requirements of the Securities Act of 1933. This would be a landmark shift, recognizing the unique nature of some blockchain-based networks. What Happens After the Markup? The upcoming committee vote is just one step in a long process. If the crypto market structure bill passes the markup, it moves to the full Senate. However, it must also align with any similar efforts from the House of Representatives. The path to becoming law remains complex, but this markup represents a vital injection of hope for an industry craving stability. This development is a testament to growing political recognition that clear rules are necessary for the United States to remain competitive in the global digital economy. The outcome of next week’s session will be a strong indicator of the political will for substantive crypto law. Conclusion: A Defining Moment for U.S. Crypto Policy The Senate Banking Committee’s markup of the Responsible Financial Innovation Act is more than procedure; it’s a potential turning point. A successful markup would signal that bipartisan consensus on core principles of the crypto market structure bill is possible. For investors and builders, it offers a glimpse of a future with clearer rules, reduced legal risk, and a more stable foundation for growth. The entire industry will be watching closely next week. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) What is a markup session in Congress? A markup is a meeting where a congressional committee debates, amends, and rewrites proposed legislation. It’s a critical step where the details of a bill are finalized before it is sent to the full chamber (Senate or House) for a vote. What is the Responsible Financial Innovation Act? It is a comprehensive legislative proposal, primarily sponsored by Senators Cynthia Lummis and Kirsten Gillibrand, designed to create a complete regulatory framework for digital assets in the United States. It addresses classification, consumer protection, and the roles of financial regulators. How would this bill change the roles of the SEC and CFTC? The bill aims to clarify jurisdiction. It proposes granting the CFTC authority over digital asset commodities and their spot markets, while the SEC would retain authority over digital asset securities. This seeks to end the current regulatory overlap and confusion. What does “exemption from securities registration” mean? It means that certain cryptocurrencies that meet specific criteria (like being sufficiently decentralized and functional) would not have to go through the lengthy and costly process of registering as a security with the SEC, which is currently required for most investment contracts. Will this bill definitely become law? Not necessarily. Even if it passes the Senate Banking Committee, it must pass the full Senate and be reconciled with any related bill from the House of Representatives before going to the President’s desk. The markup is a major step forward, but the process is long. Why is this bill important for the average crypto user? Clear federal regulation can lead to greater consumer protections, more reliable and compliant exchanges, reduced risk of sudden regulatory enforcement actions, and potentially greater institutional adoption, which can increase market stability.

GeeFi has made a powerful entrance, closing its first phase after selling 10 million tokens and raising $500,000 , establishing a holder base of over 2,100 investors . The project has now sold a total of 22.5M tokens , cumulatively raising more than $1 million . As a comprehensive non-custodial ecosystem, GeeFi is gaining rapid traction, with analysts predicting Phase 3 will sell out in under 10 days due to persistent rumors regarding major exchange listings. Moving Past Ripple’s Legal Headaches Ripple (XRP) continues to face ongoing legal battles and price stagnation that leave many investors uncertain about its short-term potential. In contrast, smart money is flowing into GeeFi , a project that experts frequently identify as 2026’s 100x gem . It provides a unified interface where users can manage assets across more than 14 networks , enabling instant token swaps and chain bridging without the technical barriers often found in DeFi. This practical, all-in-one approach solves the fragmentation problem that frustrates modern crypto users. The GeeFi Team started development in 2023 and publicly unveiled the project in 2024, maintaining a strict focus on delivering a working product. This dedication is evident in the platform’s design, which ensures users retain absolute control over their private keys. With the Android app already live and an iOS version currently in development, GeeFi is demonstrating tangible progress. This commitment to building a functional ecosystem is a primary reason why analysts are confident it will be 2026’s 100x gem . The GeeFi Presale Advantage GeeFi is currently advancing through Phase 2 of its presale, with tokens priced at just $0.06 . This entry point offers a guaranteed return of 667% based on the confirmed $0.40 listing price . The potential for financial growth is immense; a strategic investment of $1,800 today could expand to $90,000 if the token reaches the analysts’ projected $3 valuation , delivering a massive 4,900% ROI . Market observers have been quick to praise the presale’s trajectory. The momentum from Phase 1 has successfully carried over, with Phase 2 now more than 80% complete . In this phase alone, the project has raised over $750K by selling 12.5M tokens . Experts anticipate that Phase 3 will commence next week and sell out rapidly, driven by intensifying speculation about GeeFi listing on top-tier exchanges. This accelerated timeline is validating the project’s status as 2026’s 100x gem . High-Yield Staking and Referrals A major factor attracting liquidity to GeeFi is its aggressive staking structure. Investors can generate substantial passive income through various term options. By locking tokens, holders earn an impressive 15% APR for one month , 22% APR for three months , or a market-leading 55% APR for a 12-month term . For those requiring flexibility, GeeFi offers a staking tier with no locked funds that still provides returns of up to 10% . To further incentivize community expansion, GeeFi includes a lucrative referral system. By sharing a unique link, users earn a 5% bonus in GEE tokens on every purchase made by their referrals. This program encourages organic growth and allows early adopters to significantly multiply their holdings. These features offer real, sustainable yield, making the project highly attractive to investors focused on maximizing portfolio efficiency. Secure Your Position Before Phase 3 The window to invest in a high-utility project before mass adoption is closing fast. GeeFi’s presale represents a rare chance to enter a project with immense upside potential before the broader market reacts. With a deflationary token model, a live product, and a roadmap featuring a crypto debit card, GeeFi is positioned to become an industry leader. The speed at which tokens are selling indicates extreme market confidence. As the crypto market prepares for its next expansion, projects with proven utility and strong fundamentals will outperform speculative assets. Missing out on GeeFi now could result in significant regret when the token launches on major exchanges, confirming the prediction that it is 2026’s 100x gem . The time to act is now. Securing your allocation during the presale is the most effective way to capitalize on the explosive growth experts are forecasting.

At a recent industry event, Binance founder Changpeng Zhao (CZ) dropped a thought-provoking idea: Bitcoin might be breaking free from its well-known four-year cycle and charging into uncharted territory—a potential Bitcoin supercycle . This concept isn’t just jargon; it signals a fundamental shift in how the world’s leading cryptocurrency operates. Let’s unpack what a supercycle means and why CZ’s insight matters for every investor watching the market. What Exactly Is a Bitcoin Supercycle? Traditionally, Bitcoin has moved in roughly four-year phases, often tied to its “halving” events where new coin creation slows. These cycles typically include a bull run, a peak, a bear market, and accumulation. However, Changpeng Zhao suggests this pattern may no longer apply. He defines a Bitcoin supercycle as a prolonged bullish phase, primarily driven by a new, powerful force: sustained and expanding institutional investment. Think of it as the market graduating. Instead of retail-driven boom and bust, a supercycle implies deeper, more stable capital entering the ecosystem. This could smooth out volatility and support a longer-term price appreciation trend. The key question is: what evidence supports this shift? Why Might a Bitcoin Supercycle Be Starting Now? Several converging factors make the supercycle theory plausible. First, regulatory frameworks, while evolving, are creating clearer paths for large institutions to participate. Second, the introduction of Bitcoin spot ETFs in major markets like the US has opened a massive, compliant gateway for traditional finance capital. Institutional Onramps: Products like ETFs allow pension funds and asset managers to buy Bitcoin without directly holding it. Macro Hedge: Increasingly, corporations and nations view Bitcoin as a digital gold—a hedge against inflation and currency devaluation. Network Maturity: Bitcoin’s underlying technology and security have proven robust over 15 years, building trust. Therefore, the demand may no longer be cyclical and speculative but structural and long-term. This constant inflow could prevent the deep drawdowns seen in past cycles, fundamentally altering the price chart. What Are the Implications of a Sustained Bitcoin Supercycle? If CZ’s view is correct, the implications are profound. For investors, it changes the strategy from “time the cycle” to “time in the market.” The intense fear of missing out (FOMO) that marks cycle tops might be replaced by more steady, strategic accumulation. For the broader crypto ecosystem, a stable and rising Bitcoin price acts as a rising tide, lifting all boats. It boosts confidence, funds innovation in layer-2 solutions, and strengthens the entire digital asset class. However, challenges remain. Regulatory hurdles still exist globally, and the market must prove it can handle this new scale of interest without major disruptions. How Should Investors Navigate This Potential Shift? Navigating a potential Bitcoin supercycle requires a adjusted mindset. First, prioritize education over hype. Understand the macro-economic drivers behind institutional adoption. Second, consider dollar-cost averaging (DCA) as a core strategy to mitigate volatility while maintaining exposure. Focus on Fundamentals: Look at adoption metrics, hash rate, and institutional custody solutions, not just price. Manage Risk: Never invest more than you can afford to lose, even in a bullish long-term thesis. Think Long-Term: If this is a supercycle, short-term price swings become noise in a much larger trend. Actionable insight: Use periods of market fear as potential opportunities for accumulation, trusting in the longer-term structural trend CZ highlights. Conclusion: A New Chapter for Bitcoin? Changpeng Zhao’s comments are more than just market speculation; they are a lens through which to view Bitcoin’s maturation. The idea of a Bitcoin supercycle represents the asset’s journey from a niche technological experiment to a legitimate component of the global financial system. While no one can predict the future with certainty, the signs of deepening institutional involvement are undeniable. This potential paradigm shift invites us to look beyond the charts of the past and consider a future where Bitcoin’s growth is driven by a new, more resilient engine of demand. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) What did Changpeng Zhao say about Bitcoin? At the BitcoinMENA event, CZ suggested Bitcoin’s traditional four-year market cycle might be ending, and the asset could be entering a new phase called a “supercycle,” driven largely by institutional investors. What is a Bitcoin supercycle? A Bitcoin supercycle is a theoretical extended bullish period that breaks the historic four-year pattern, characterized by sustained buying pressure from large-scale institutional adoption rather than retail speculation. What triggers a Bitcoin supercycle? The primary trigger, as suggested by CZ, is the large-scale, continuous entry of institutional capital through new regulated vehicles like ETFs, treating Bitcoin as a long-term strategic asset rather than a speculative trade. How would a supercycle affect Bitcoin’s price? It could lead to a longer period of price appreciation with potentially less severe bear markets, as constant institutional demand provides a stronger price floor and reduces extreme volatility. Is the Bitcoin supercycle guaranteed to happen? No, it is a compelling theory based on observable trends, but not a guarantee. Macroeconomic conditions, regulatory changes, and technological developments can all influence the market’s path. How is this different from previous Bitcoin bull runs? Previous bull runs were often fueled by retail hype and followed a predictable cycle of peak and crash. A supercycle implies a fundamental, structural change in demand that could alter that pattern.

With a presale Phase 6 nearing completion at a strikingly fast pace in spite of being one of the cheapest cryptos in the market, selling for a mere $0.035, the token known by the ticker name MUTM has already surpassed Ripple (XRP) in terms of social interactions. Already over 18,380 investors have joined the Mutuum Finance (MUTM) presale. Over $19.2 million in funds have already been raised for the token. Unlike XRP, MUTM provides a complete decentralized financial solution. XRP faces a market environment in which the biggest pool of investors belong to the last cohort of acquirers of the token. With the highly awaited testnet ‘V1 Sepolia’ approaching completion, the MUTM token seems to gain a louder voice in the community about being the top crypto for the coming year. Ripple Displays Early Indications of Possible Turnaround in the Presence of Significant Whale Accumulation Ripple (XRP) has had a tough time of late, falling by 31%, but underlying indicators point to a possible change in trend. Social sentiment has reached a record high for FUD sentiment since October of last year, a trend that was followed by a 22% jump in a mere three days, while whale activity has reached a record high in seven years. While the overall sentiment in the market indicates a possible cautious altcoin rebound, investors appear to also be interested in new altcoins that have shown some initial success and real-world functionality in the DeFi space. Focus is falling on the new arrivals with realistic possibilities, such as Mutuum Finance (MUTM), which is rapidly gaining traction as the best crypto in December 2025. Mutuum Finance Exceeds $19.2M in Presale Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has reached a critical point in its presale phase, catching the interest of more investors. From a starting point of $0.01 in Phase 1, MUTM has progressed to $0.035 in Phase 6, inching closer to the estimated launch price of $0.06. Investors in the presale have the unique privilege of purchasing the token at a massively discounted price that promises gains of up to 600%. The campaign has managed to raise over $19.2 million funds from more than 18,380 unique investors. Seeing that Phase 6 has already surpassed the 95% sale mark, the number of remaining tokens is very limited. Phase 7 will witness a price jump to $0.04, nearing the eventual launch price. This strong performance makes MUTM one of the top crypto investments in the current DeFi market. Why MUTM Is a Must-Watch DeFi Crypto Mutuum Finance is fast becoming the best crypto to buy now. The presale has raised substantial funds. There are also a significant number of token holders at 18,380. At the current Phase 6 price of $0.035, MUTM has already appreciated by 250% since Phase 1. Phase 6 is nearing completion. This may be one of the last chances to invest before the token price increases to $0.04 in Phase 7. With the estimated listing on the exchanges for $0.06, the possible gains for the presale investors would be over 500%. Presale success, high demand for the token, and the low supply of the token make MUTM the top crypto to watch for the coming months. Parallels to Solana’s Historic Surge Investing in MUTM at the current price of $0.035 calls to mind investing in Solana in 2021 when the token was selling at $1.50. Solana later rallied to a record high of $256, representing a mind-blowing gain of 17,100%. If a similar trend were to occur in MUTM, the token may surpass the value of $5. Early investors in the MUTM token may witness a revolutionary gain. Mutuum Finance has become extremely popular, even surpassing Ripple (XRP) in social interactions. Phase 6 at $0.035+ is over 95% sold out, having 18,380+ investors and raising $19.2 million. The coming testnet for V1 Sepolia enables the full range of DeFi services, including loans, borrowing, and interest-bearing tokens. Getting in before Phase 7 at $0.04 will allow investors to benefit from the gains of over 500%, making it the best crypto to invest today and one of the most visible top crypto in the market.

The two are set to create a unified, cross-border advocacy platform. According to the announcement , the two will create a formal agreement that will give them authority to advocate for responsible regulation that enables global blockchain and digital asset innovation to thrive while protecting consumers’ access to digital assets. Cody Carbone, CEO of the Digital Chamber, stated, “We are proud to welcome CryptoUK under The Digital Chamber umbrella. This move strengthens our ability to champion the work our members are building and to advocate for them across global markets.” CryptoUK says that both organizations are like-minded This move follows TDC’s State Network launch in November. This was part of its efforts to push for digital asset policies in state and local government, with a part of their goal to boost pro-crypto candidates at every level of government as the 2026 midterm races take shape. According to Cody Carbone, effective digital asset policy requires borderless coordination, looking for opportunities in all governments and markets. “CryptoUK is a proven leading voice in the UK, and we are excited to create such a strong bond to expand our global policy expertise.” On the other hand, CryptoUK’s Executive Director, Su Carpenter, said both organizations are like-minded with shared objectives and approaches. “This move will strengthen both organisations by enabling cross-jurisdictional knowledge sharing and access to broader resources. At a critical time for UK-US regulatory coordination, we see this as an important step forward for our members and the wider digital asset industry,” he added. However, the US and the UK are at different places in terms of regulations. In the US, lawmakers are continuing to work on a bill to regulate the crypto industry after passing legislation regulating stablecoins over the summer. Federal regulators are now focused on implementing regulations for stablecoins. On the other hand, the UK has adopted a phased approach to crypto regulation, aiming to position itself as a global hub for digital assets while also prioritizing consumer protection and financial stability. Meanwhile, the industry has added several new advocacy groups, including the Solana Policy Institute, Ripple-backed National Cryptocurrency Association, and, most recently, the American Innovation Project. UK initiative to catch up to the US in terms of stablecoin regulation Market watchers have recently argued that the US is pulling ahead of the UK in the race to become a leading crypto center. But Bank of England Deputy Governor Sarah Breeden said that the country aims to catch up to the US in terms of stablecoin regulation. She also said new rules will be operational just as quickly as in the US. This has been proven by last week’s milestone. As reported by Cryptopolitan, the Property Act 2025 received royal assent from King Charles III, legally recognizing digital assets as a form of property. The short bill passed both houses of Parliament without amendment. It confirms that digital holdings such as bitcoin and stablecoins can be the subject of property rights distinct from traditional categories of physical objects or contractual rights. CryptoUK reacted, saying, “This gives digital assets a much clearer legal footing — especially for things like proving ownership, recovering stolen assets, and handling them in insolvency or estate cases.” The UK’s Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) announced that it is establishing a new group of stablecoin issuers within its Regulatory Sandbox. The FCA calls this “a unique chance for innovative companies to test their stablecoin products and services under the UK’s evolving regulatory regime.” As part of this effort, companies that want to create pound-backed stablecoins under the FCA’s future rules for stablecoin issuers will be able to do so in a controlled setting with the regulator’s supervision. Companies interested in joining the sandbox cohort must submit their applications by January 18, 2026. They will need to include a thorough test plan and proof that they are ready to start testing. The FCA stated that after the review process is completed next year, it will publish a public list of cleared applicants. Want your project in front of crypto’s top minds?

Therefore, this total reflects combined holdings across public and private companies, ETFs, governments, custodians, and emerging DeFi protocols now using Bitcoin as collateral. The surge in institutional accumulation signals a major evolution in Bitcoin’s role within global finance. Once a niche digital experiment, Bitcoin has become a strategic reserve asset for leading corporations, with MicroStrategy and others reinforcing their balance sheets through long-term BTC holdings. At the same time, spot ETFs across the U.S., Europe, and Asia are accelerating mainstream adoption,providing regulated, accessible exposure that is drawing in both institutional capital and everyday investors. Governments have also helped push Bitcoin past this historic milestone. El Salvador, the first country to adopt BTC as legal tender, continues to grow its reserves, while other nations quietly accumulate through strategic diversification or asset seizures. These rising state-level holdings underscore Bitcoin’s evolution from a speculative asset to a geopolitically relevant store of value. Custodians and major asset managers have further accelerated this trend. As demand for secure, compliant BTC storage surges, institutional-grade custody solutions are enabling pension funds, hedge funds, and insurance firms to enter the market with confidence. This infrastructure boom has transformed Bitcoin from a niche technology into a fully integrated component of global financial portfolios. Well, DeFi’s growing integration of Bitcoin marks a new frontier for the asset. Protocols now using BTC as collateral and liquidity are effectively bridging the gap between the world’s largest digital currency and decentralized finance, laying the groundwork for Bitcoin to function as a core layer of on-chain financial infrastructure. Surpassing 4 million BTC in global treasuries signals more than aggressive accumulation, it reflects a structural realignment in modern finance. As corporations, governments, ETFs, and custodians embed Bitcoin into their balance sheets and product offerings, its identity is evolving from a speculative asset to a strategic institutional cornerstone. With only 21 million coins ever to exist, this accelerating adoption amplifies Bitcoin’s scarcity narrative and reinforces its long-term value proposition. Top U.S. Bank CEOs to Meet Senators on December 11 to Shape Crypto Market Structure In a notable shift for traditional finance, top U.S. bank CEOs have been called to a closed-door Senate meeting on December 11 to discuss the future of crypto market structure. According to analyst Diana, leaders from Citi, Bank of America, and Wells Fargo, long skeptical of digital assets, are now helping shape the regulatory framework they once resisted. This comes at a pivotal moment for U.S. finance, as crypto adoption accelerates amid regulatory gaps and growing institutional demand for safer, clearer entry points. Engaging legacy banking leaders signals lawmakers’ push toward a more coordinated, mainstream framework for crypto oversight. Banks may be driven by more than regulatory compliance. With crypto ETFs gaining traction, blockchain payment systems maturing, and tokenized assets entering institutional adoption, major banks risk losing relevance if they stay on the sidelines. Shaping regulatory frameworks could give them a strategic advantage as digital assets integrate with traditional finance. For the crypto sector, the outcome is double-edged. Collaboration with banks and lawmakers could finally deliver regulatory clarity, attracting institutional capital and enhancing legitimacy. Yet critics warn that excessive bank influence may produce restrictive rules that favor incumbents and stifle innovation. What does this show? Well, the symbolism is clear; institutions that once urged regulators to shun crypto are now invited to shape its future. December 11 could mark more than a policy discussion, it may be the moment Wall Street moves from observer to architect in the digital asset ecosystem. Conclusion Bitcoin crossing 4 million coins in institutional and sovereign treasuries marks more than a milestone, it signals a shift in global finance. As corporations, governments, and investment funds secure significant supply, Bitcoin is evolving from speculation to a strategic financial asset. With demand rising and supply tightening, it’s positioning itself as a key driver in economic policy, capital allocation, and long-term wealth preservation. On the other hand, The December 11 meeting could mark a pivotal shift in the U.S. crypto landscape, as lawmakers and top banks collaborate to provide long-awaited clarity and structure. This convergence of traditional finance and digital assets may redefine regulatory frameworks and cement Wall Street’s role in building a secure, accessible, and innovative crypto ecosystem, potentially shaping the next era of mainstream cryptocurrency adoption.",News|Bitcoin,EN,0,0,BTC|FIAT|MARKET|DIGITAL ASSET TREASURY|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-12-09 17:31:04

Moreover, macroeconomic pressures could push it lower. Amid uncertainty over XRP’s short-term direction, Digitap ($TAP) emerges as a promising alternative for global banking. The platform combines traditional banking with digital assets, providing practical utility and growth opportunities. Could $TAP be the best crypto to buy now in December ? This article discusses XRP’s challenges, the utility-driven upside of $TAP, and why Digitap’s presale has been attracting major investor attention. XRP Price Trapped in Bearish Channel as $2.00 Support Holds by a Thread XRP has been consolidating between $2.23 and $1.95 over the past week. The altcoin faces selling pressure after an 18% November drop erased its early-2025 gains. Technically, XRP remains confined in a descending daily channel, with key support at $2.00. If a breakdown occurs, the XRP price could test $1.80 or even $1.60. The first key resistance is found around $2.30, above the bearish channel. An RSI below 50 indicates that momentum is still bearish. Moreover, CoinCodex predicts that XRP might be bearish in December and has recorded only about 37% green days over the past month. Utility-Driven Upside vs. Macro Risk: 400% Payment Surge Challenges Bearish Outlook On other news, Ripple locked 700 million XRP in escrow on December 1 with no releases, easing supply fears. Network upgrades like Rippled 2.6.2 , scheduled for December 19, are set to enhance scalability. However, traders are closely watching for a possible decline to $1.80 if macroeconomic pressures from Fed rate cuts and BOJ hikes intensify. Adding to the volatility, CryptoQuant data shows XRP Ledger Velocity has surged to its highest level of the year, signaling rapid trading and heightened liquidity. This, combined with a rise in short positions, suggests any negative catalyst could erase further gains. Despite these risks, a 400% surge in on-chain payments over three months points to potential utility-driven gains for XRP in 2026 if $2.00 support holds. However, with ongoing uncertainty surrounding XRP’s recovery, $TAP offers an alternative for investors seeking the top altcoins to buy this year .

As artificial intelligence evolves into autonomous systems that can take real-world actions, a critical challenge emerges: how do we prevent the AI agents revolution from splintering into incompatible, proprietary silos? The answer comes from an unprecedented alliance between tech giants and the open-source community, spearheaded by the Linux Foundation . This collaboration promises to shape the future of how intelligent systems interact, collaborate, and serve humanity. What is the Agentic AI Foundation and Why Does It Matter? The Linux Foundation has launched the Agentic AI Foundation (AAIF), a dedicated group aimed at creating standards for AI agents. Unlike traditional AI that merely responds to prompts, AI agents are systems that can perceive their environment, make decisions, and take actions to achieve goals. Without standardization, we risk creating a fragmented landscape where agents from different companies cannot communicate or work together effectively. The AAIF represents a proactive move to establish shared protocols before proprietary systems dominate the market. Jim Zemlin, executive director of the Linux Foundation, emphasizes the urgency: “The goal is to avoid a future of ‘closed wall’ proprietary stacks, where tool connections, agent behavior, and orchestration are locked behind a handful of platforms.” Key Players and Their Contributions Three major companies are anchoring this initiative with significant technological donations: Company Contribution Purpose Anthropic Model Context Protocol (MCP) Standard way to connect AI models to tools and data Block Goose Framework Open-source agent framework for building AI agents OpenAI AGENTS.md Simple instruction file for AI coding tools These contributions form what Nick Cooper, an OpenAI engineer, calls “the basic plumbing of the agent era.” Other members include AWS, Bloomberg, Cloudflare, and Google, creating broad industry support for interoperable AI systems. How OpenAI’s AGENTS.md Simplifies AI Development OpenAI ‘s contribution, AGENTS.md, represents a practical approach to standardization. This simple instruction file allows developers to add standardized behavior instructions to their code repositories. Think of it as a universal manual that tells any AI coding tool how to interact with a particular codebase. The benefits are substantial: Reduces time spent building custom connectors Creates predictable agent behavior across different codebases Simplifies deployment in security-conscious environments Enables consistent AI assistance regardless of the underlying platform Cooper explains the philosophy behind this approach: “We need multiple protocols to negotiate, communicate, and work together to deliver value for people, and that sort of openness and communication is why it’s not ever going to be one provider, one host, one company.” Anthropic’s Model Context Protocol: The Integration Backbone Anthropic ‘s Model Context Protocol (MCP) serves as the connective tissue between AI models and the tools they need to function. David Soria Parra, MCP co-creator, describes its purpose: “We’re all better off if we have an open integration center where you can build something once as a developer and use it across any client.” MCP addresses a critical pain point in AI development: the endless need for one-off adapters. By providing a standardized way for AI systems to access tools, data, and applications, MCP could dramatically accelerate agent development and deployment. Key advantages of MCP include: Vendor-neutral infrastructure Reduced development overhead Increased interoperability between different AI systems Foundation for building complex, multi-agent ecosystems Block’s Goose Framework: Proving Open-Source Can Compete While Block (the fintech company behind Square and Cash App) isn’t traditionally known for AI infrastructure, their contribution of the Goose framework demonstrates the power of open-source development. Brad Axen, AI Tech Lead at Block, frames their motivation: “Getting it out into the world gives us a place for other people to come help us make it better. We have a lot of contributors from open source, and everything they do to improve it comes back to our company.” Goose serves as a working example of what AAIF aims to achieve—an agent framework designed to integrate seamlessly with shared building blocks like MCP and AGENTS.md. Thousands of engineers already use Goose weekly for coding, data analysis, and documentation tasks, proving that open alternatives can match proprietary solutions at scale. The Governance Challenge: Ensuring True Openness One of the most critical aspects of AAIF is its governance structure. The Linux Foundation has created a “directed fund” model where companies contribute through membership dues, but Zemlin emphasizes that “funding doesn’t equal control.” Project roadmaps are set by technical steering committees, and no single member gets unilateral say over direction. This structure addresses a fundamental concern in standardization efforts: the risk of one company dominating the standards to the detriment of others. By placing these technologies under the Linux Foundation’s neutral governance, the AAIF aims to create truly open standards that benefit the entire ecosystem. What Success Looks Like for AI Agent Standardization The AAIF participants have clear but different visions of success: For Zemlin: “An early indicator of success, in addition to adoption of these standards, would be the development and implementation of shared standards being used by vendor agents around the world.” For Cooper: “I don’t want it to be a stagnant thing. I don’t want these protocols to be part of this foundation, and that’s where they sat for two years. They should evolve and continually accept further input.” There’s also recognition that even with open governance, practical implementation matters. Zemlin points to open-source history—like Kubernetes “winning” the container race—as evidence that “dominance emerges from merit and not vendor control.” The Transformative Potential of Standardized AI Agents If successful, the AAIF’s work could fundamentally reshape the AI landscape. Instead of closed platforms competing through proprietary advantages, we could see an open, mix-and-match ecosystem reminiscent of the interoperable systems that built the modern web. This transformation offers several compelling benefits: Benefit Impact Reduced Development Costs Less time building custom connectors and integrations Increased Innovation Developers can focus on creating value rather than solving compatibility issues Enhanced Security Standardized safety patterns and best practices Market Competition Level playing field where the best solutions win based on merit FAQs About the AI Agent Standardization Initiative What companies are leading this initiative? The primary contributors are OpenAI , Anthropic , and Block , with additional support from AWS, Bloomberg, Cloudflare, and Google. Who is Jim Zemlin? Jim Zemlin is the Executive Director of the Linux Foundation , the organization hosting the Agentic AI Foundation. What is the Linux Foundation’s role? The Linux Foundation provides neutral governance and infrastructure for open-source projects, ensuring no single company controls the standards. How will this affect AI developers? Developers will benefit from standardized protocols that reduce integration work and create more predictable behavior across different AI systems. When will we see results from this initiative? Initial protocols and frameworks are already available, with broader adoption and refinement expected over the coming months. Conclusion: Building the Foundation for Collaborative Intelligence The launch of the Agentic AI Foundation represents a pivotal moment in AI development. By bringing together competitors under the neutral banner of the Linux Foundation, the industry is taking proactive steps to ensure the AI agent era develops as an open, interoperable ecosystem rather than a collection of walled gardens. The success of this initiative will determine whether AI agents become truly collaborative systems that can work together across organizational boundaries, or whether they remain isolated tools limited by proprietary constraints. The vision is ambitious but achievable: a world where AI agents from different providers can seamlessly interact, share information, and collaborate on complex tasks, much like how different software applications work together on today’s internet. The stakes are high, but the potential rewards—accelerated innovation, reduced costs, and more capable AI systems—make this standardization effort one of the most important developments in artificial intelligence today.

The token continued its expansion to $3,342.21. The last price move caused $36.3M in long liquidations for the past 24 hours, of which close to 50% were on Binance. The latest price moves showed a quick return to speculation, as traders opened new positions just as the token showed signs of a directional move. Open interest spiked within a short timespan, from $17.6B to $18.5B. However, traders opened new positions on the short side, suggesting the rally may be short-lived. Bitmine has $1B to buy more ETH Bitmine revealed it had been buying more ETH in the past week, expanding its treasury to $12.05B .

Investors are increasingly demanding exposure beyond simple price tracking, seeking tokenized financial instruments that generate returns. If regulators approve the application, it could establish important precedents for how staking rewards are classified . BlackRock’s dominance in crypto ETFs is undeniable. Its iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) has become the largest crypto ETF globally and the most successful ETF launch in history , commanding approximately $70 billion in assets. BlackRock CEO Larry Fink recently revealed that multiple sovereign wealth funds are quietly accumulating BTC “incrementally” despite the recent 30%+ correction. Bitcoin Price Prediction: BTC Holds $90K as Bulls Eye Return to All-Time Highs Bitcoin has bounced strongly from the $90,000 zone and is now pushing into key resistance inside a long-term descending channel. The latest move marks a potential shift in momentum, especially with price reclaiming the $93,000 level and targeting a breakout from this downward structure. Source: TradingView Buyers are currently defending the $90,000 support with confidence, and if BTC holds this zone, the chart shows two possible bullish scenarios. In the short term, Bitcoin could sweep down to retest $80,000 or even $70,000 liquidity before making a sharp reversal to the upside. Alternatively, a clean breakout above the channel could send BTC surging directly toward $112,000, with a longer-term path toward $126,000 if momentum holds. RSI continues to trend upward, showing early strength, and MACD histogram bars have flipped green, suggesting short-term bullish pressure. As the week begins, price action favors the bulls, but traders will want to watch for a strong daily close above $94,500 to confirm upside continuation. Maxi Doge Presale Builds Momentum as Market Eyes Next Breakout With Bitcoin on the verge of a breakout, investor attention is quickly shifting toward early-stage opportunities with even bigger potential. Maxi Doge ($MAXI ) has emerged as a top contender. Built around the high-energy ethos of gym culture and trader discipline, $MAXI is more than just a meme coin.

Recent on-chain data reveals a staggering trend: a massive Ethereum accumulation event is underway. Whale and shark wallets have scooped up 934,240 ETH, worth approximately $3.15 billion, in just three weeks. This aggressive buying spree stands in stark contrast to retail investors, who sold a net 1,041 ETH last week. This divergence signals a critical moment for the market, and understanding it could be key to your strategy. What Does This Massive Ethereum Accumulation Really Mean? When we talk about ‘whales’ and ‘sharks,’ we refer to the largest holders in the cryptocurrency ecosystem. Whales typically hold between 1,000 and 10,000 ETH, while sharks hold 100 to 1,000 ETH. Their collective move to buy nearly a million ETH is a powerful vote of confidence. This level of Ethereum accumulation by sophisticated entities often precedes significant market movements. It suggests these players see current prices as a valuable entry point, potentially anticipating future growth. Data from analytics firm Santiment highlights this clear split in behavior. The buying pressure from large wallets is immense, while smaller retail addresses are distributing their holdings. This creates a fascinating supply dynamic. When smart money accumulates and weak hands sell, the stage is often set for a powerful price move. However, it’s crucial to look beyond the headline numbers. Why Are Whales Betting Big on Ethereum Now? Several factors could be driving this aggressive Ethereum accumulation . Let’s break down the potential reasons behind this billion-dollar bet. Anticipation of the Ethereum ETF: The potential approval of a spot Ethereum ETF in the US is a major catalyst. Whales may be positioning themselves ahead of expected institutional inflows. Strong Network Fundamentals: Despite price volatility, Ethereum’s network activity, including DeFi and NFT transactions, remains robust. Whales invest in utility and long-term value. Macroeconomic Hedge: Some large investors view top cryptocurrencies like Ethereum as a digital alternative to traditional assets during economic uncertainty. Technical Price Levels: The accumulation occurred around key support levels, which savvy traders often target for major purchases. This buying isn’t random. It’s a calculated move based on deep market analysis and forward-looking theses. The scale of this Ethereum accumulation indicates these players are not looking for short-term gains but are building substantial long-term positions. What Should Retail Investors Do Next? Seeing whales buy billions worth of ETH while retail sells can be confusing. Should you follow the smart money? First, understand that whale movements are a signal, not a guarantee. Their actions provide insight into market sentiment but do not dictate immediate price action. Here are some actionable insights: Do Your Own Research (DYOR): Never blindly follow whale trades. Understand your own risk tolerance and investment horizon. Consider Dollar-Cost Averaging (DCA): Instead of trying to time the market like a whale, a DCA strategy can help you build a position over time, reducing volatility risk. Monitor On-Chain Metrics: Use tools like Santiment or Glassnode to track supply distribution and exchange flows yourself. Look at the Bigger Picture: Evaluate Ethereum’s fundamentals—its upgrade roadmap, developer activity, and total value locked (TVL) in DeFi. The current Ethereum accumulation trend highlights a classic market narrative: the transfer of assets from impatient hands to patient ones. While retail sentiment may be fearful or uncertain, institutional and large-scale investors are demonstrating clear conviction. The Bottom Line on the $3.1B ETH Buy-Up The recent data paints a compelling picture of divergence and opportunity. The massive Ethereum accumulation by whales and sharks is a strong bullish indicator from some of the market’s most informed participants. It underscores a belief in Ethereum’s long-term value proposition amidst short-term noise. For the observant investor, this period represents a crucial time to assess personal strategy, educate oneself on on-chain analytics, and make informed decisions rather than emotional ones. The market often rewards those who understand the signals beneath the surface. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: Who are ‘whales’ and ‘sharks’ in cryptocurrency? A1: In crypto, ‘whales’ are entities holding very large amounts of a cryptocurrency (e.g., 1,000-10,000 ETH). ‘Sharks’ are significant holders but one tier below whales (e.g., 100-1,000 ETH). Their trading activity can influence market prices. Q2: Why is whale accumulation considered a bullish sign? A2: When large, presumably sophisticated investors accumulate an asset, it suggests they believe its price will rise in the future. It also reduces the supply available on the market, which can create upward price pressure if demand increases. Q3: Should I buy Ethereum just because whales are? A3: Not necessarily. Whale movements are one data point among many. Always conduct your own thorough research, consider your financial goals and risk tolerance, and never invest more than you can afford to lose. Q4: Where can I track whale wallet activity? A4: On-chain analytics platforms like Santiment, Glassnode, and Nansen provide data on whale holdings, transactions, and exchange flows. Many of these tools offer some free data or insights. Q5: What’s the difference between accumulation and just holding? A5: Accumulation refers to the active and consistent process of buying and adding to a position over time. Holding (or ‘HODLing’) is simply retaining assets already purchased. The recent data shows active buying, not passive holding. Q6: Could this whale activity be manipulative? A6: While possible, the sustained buying over three weeks across many wallets, as reported by Santiment, more strongly suggests genuine accumulation based on a positive outlook rather than short-term price manipulation.

Unlike Bitcoin and Ethereum, which have seen considerable declines over the past few months, Litecoin appears to be stabilizing, gaining about 7.8% this past week, according to CoinMarketCap. Although LTC has seen its fair share of declines this year, analysts still hold hope that the cryptocurrency could cross the $100 threshold and reclaim former highs. Litecoin Price Targets A $110 Breakout Litecoin may be preparing for a strong upward move, according to a new analysis from TradingView market expert MadWhale. The analyst has indicated that the cryptocurrency has the technical structure needed to break out of its long-term descending channel and potentially climb toward $110. With its current price sitting around $83, a surge to this level would represent a significant 33% rally. Related Reading: Litecoin 2M Bollinger Band Width Hits New Lows, CMT-Certified Analyst Reveals What It Means MadWhale has based his bullish LTC forecast on weekly candlesticks and how the cryptocurrency has consistently responded to past support and resistance levels. He explained that the altcoin had been trapped in a descending channel that has controlled its price for several weeks now. According to the TradingView analyst, Litecoin is now approaching the upper resistance region of the descending channel–a point where traders usually watch for either a clean breakout or a sharp rejection. From the analyst’s price chart, Litecoin’s support zones have repeatedly held firm, showing that buyers consistently defended the area. Due to this steady support, he expects Litecoin’s bounce near the descending channel’s upper resistance to build momentum. If the support holds, MadWhale suggests the cryptocurrency could skyrocket to $110, completing its breakout from the descending channel. A breakout could signal a significant shift, potentially transforming Litecoin’s recent downtrend into a new bullish phase. MadWhale’s chart also highlights the cryptocurrency’s volatility, showing that in early October, LTC had rallied around 33.84%, climbing above $120. However, just days later, it crashed more than 17%, coinciding with the October 10 liquidation event that shook the market. Update On LTC’s Price Action Litecoin is approximately 79% below its all-time high of over $410, recorded during the 2021 bull run. The cryptocurrency has dropped 17.68% over the past week and is down 33% for the year, mirroring the broader decline seen across altcoins. Despite its performance, LTC’s Fear and Greed Index remains in the neutral zone, suggesting that crypto investors are cautiously optimistic. Related Reading: Analyst Reveals How Litecoin Can Turn $3,700 Into $1 Million For Investors According to market analyst CW on X, the next sell wall for Litecoin is at $98, about 15% above its current price.

The project, which is supported by Standard Chartered SC Ventures, presents a blockchain-based solution that provides monitoring of the spot price of gold without any physical gold storage. Tokenized structure mirrors gold while removing physical storage The new product, called MG 999, uses blockchain technology to replicate the market price of gold. According to information shared with Nikkei and statements from FundBridge, the structure eliminates the traditional vaulting and logistics requirements associated with physical metal while maintaining exposure to gold’s price movements. Each token is intended to reflect real-time market conditions and is housed within a regulated fund framework. StanChart-backed unit bills Singapore fund for digitized gold investments https://t.co/nnS8A9XWSn — Nikkei Asia (@NikkeiAsia) December 9, 2025 FundBridge CEO Sue Lynn Lim stated that the company paid attention to ensuring that MG 999 would comply with regulatory requirements related to fund governance and incorporate digital infrastructure. She clarified that the company cooperates with its partners to establish a framework that bridges the gap between conventional supervision and a blockchain-based framework. The fund does not hold any physical bullion; instead, it utilizes a synthetic mechanism that tracks the performance of the metal. The product enhances Standard Chartered’s exposure in the tokenization industry. The majority shareholder in Zodia Custody and Zodia Markets, both of which focus on institutional digital-asset offerings, is also SC Ventures, which supports Libear a. The introduction is preceded by the involvement of Standard Chartered in a physically supported gold fund in Singapor e, wh ere the bank acts as the custodian of bullion at the Le Freeport plant at Changi Airport. Investor demand and market conditions frame the launch The MG 999 rollout occurs at a time when global demand for gold is on the rise. Based on the information presented, central banks have accumulated more gold due to concerns about the U.S. dollar and the evolving geopolitical landscape. The uncertainty in financial terms has also led institutions to turn to other asset structures, such as commodity-based structures. Tariff policies introduced by President Donald Trump were cited as one of the reasons for the shift toward gold-backed products. Besides monitoring market performance, MG 999 has also added lending capabilities to the Singapore jewelry industry. The first borrower under the structure has been identified as Mustafa Gold, who is a local retailer. The design enables retailers to receive credit against their inventory of gold jewelry while still having the items on display. The tokens were described as complex by Mustafa founder Mustaq Ahmad, who gave the framework as an opportunity to work with working capital tools using digital assets. Institutions advance blockchain use for real-world assets According to FundBridge, MG 999 eliminates vaulting and logistics expenses while maintaining gold-linked price exposure. The company indicated that the fund would be set to meet the requirements of a regulated market segment and, at the same time, expose real-world assets to blockchain railways. Libeara and FundBridge will continue to serve institutional clients seeking digital solutions to access commodity-linked products.

XRP’s price may be experiencing sideways movements, but both retail and institutional investors are still showing heightened appetite for the leading alctoin via the Spot Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs). A Record-Breaking Week For The XRP ETFs In the world of digital asset investments, XRP is emerging as one of the major assets that is gaining serious attention among investors and traders. Following a significant inflow of cash into exchange-traded funds linked to the leading cryptocurrency, it is once again in the limelight of crypto investment. A crypto enthusiast known as XRP Update on the social media platform X has outlined that the altcoin is currently undergoing massive validation. While the broader market cools down, Spot XRP Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs) record their largest weekly inflows since the products were launched. A massive wave of capital flowing into a fund indicates that sentiment among investors, especially institutions, is undergoing a powerful shift. In addition, it suggests that major investors may be actively preparing for the altcoin’s next notable move upward rather than remaining on the sidelines. According to the data shared by the enthusiast, the funds amassed inflows valued at $289 million in a single week, marking its most successful week ever. After this week of bullish trading for the funds, they have now recorded massive inflows in 6 consecutive weeks. These 6-week inflows currently represent nearly 30% of the total Assets Under Management (AUM), which is likely associated with the recent United States ETF launches. When ETF inflows surge, it typically implies that institutional demand is increasing again, indicating that high-net-worth investors are exploring the token. The Fund Takes The Lead In Cryptocurrency Spot ETF XRP has just reached a major milestone that reflects its growing position as a valuable and reliable investment strategy. Brad Garlinghouse , the Chief Executive Officer (CEO) of Ripple, announced that the token has emerged as the fastest-moving crypto Spot ETF on the market. After more than 4 weeks of launch, the fund continues to record inflows, reaching $1 billion in AUM in the US, making it the fastest ETF. This type of growth was last seen with its Ethereum counterpart, which launched late last year. With over 40 crypto ETFs introduced this year in the US alone, Garlinghouse has offered his take on what the development means, highlighting two key takeaways. According to the Ripple CEO, demand for regulated cryptocurrency goods is pent up. Additionally, millions more people who don’t need to be experts may now use crypto thanks to Vanguard’s offering of access to regular retirement and trading accounts for Americans. For this new generation of off-chain crypto holders, Garlinghouse noted that durability, stability, and community are all important but often overlooked factors.",XRP|Altcoin|Assets Under Management|AUM|Brad Garlinghouse|Crypto Spot ETFs|ETFs|ripple|Spot XRP Exchange-Traded Funds|XRP news|XRP price|XRP Update|XRPUSD|XRPUSDT,EN,0,0,ALTCOIN|BUSINESS|TRADING|XRP|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-12-09 18:00:52

The study examined emerging monetary infrastructure and technology. Digital assets and fintech such as XRP and Ripple are increasingly shaping Brazil’s foreign-exchange dynamics. These developments may affect economic stability and capital flows. The Rise of ForexTech in Brazil The Boston University paper defines ForexTech as fintech enabling easier access to foreign currencies and digital assets . Retail and corporate users now access U.S. dollars, stablecoins, and other foreign instruments. This innovation increases financial inclusion but also introduces systemic risks. Capital outflows through ForexTech can challenge monetary control and weaken domestic currency strength. Between 2018 and 2024, Brazil’s largest ForexTech firms increased their share of the interbank FX market from 1% to 7.1%. These firms reportedly moved nearly US$30 billion annually through digital platforms. Such volumes are significant relative to traditional banks’ operations. A Boston University paper just named Ripple and $XRP alongside Brazil’s evolving foreign exchange system Not influencers. Not blogs. Academic research on monetary infrastructure Brazilian fintechs are using $XRP for real-world settlement You watching the chart or the rails? pic.twitter.com/W7s9MZS4Ce — X Finance Bull (@Xfinancebull) December 9, 2025 Crypto Assets and Brazil’s 2024 FX Volatility The study links crypto adoption to Brazil’s 2024 foreign-exchange turbulence. Net financial outflows surged to US$95 billion, creating a US$19 billion deficit in the FX market. Crypto-related capital outflows alone reached US$17 billion. Around 9.2 million Brazilians held digital assets, totaling US$8.5 billion in holdings by December 2024. The researchers introduced the term “digital sin” for this reliance on digital channels. It mirrors “original sin,” which describes structural foreign-currency dependence. Digital sin emphasizes the risks from technology-enabled outflows rather than debt. XRP’s Real-World Role in Brazilian Finance The study noted Ripple and XRP as part of Brazil’s evolving foreign-exchange system. XRP Ledger (XRPL) is now used for real-world settlement by fintechs. For example, VERT Capital tokenized public-pension receivables on XRPL, managing around BRL 200 million (~US$40 million). We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Mercado Bitcoin announced plans to tokenize over US$200 million in regulated financial assets on XRPL. This includes fixed-income and equity instruments. Meanwhile, Braza Group launched BBRL, a real-denominated stablecoin on XRPL, to simplify business and consumer transactions. Innovation Meets Regulatory Challenges XRPL adoption shows how crypto infrastructure is maturing in Brazil. Yet, it creates lightly regulated conduits for foreign-currency movement. Such channels complicate monetary policy and oversight. Regulators face the challenge of balancing innovation with financial stability. Implications for Brazil and Emerging Markets Brazil must reconcile fintech modernization with stable currency control. ForexTech growth could increase unregulated capital flight risks. Adaptive policies and robust oversight are essential to manage systemic vulnerabilities. Academic recognition, as reported by X Finance Bull, highlights Ripple and XRP’s real impact on Brazil’s financial system. The integration of XRPL is no longer experimental—it is becoming structural. Emerging markets may face similar tensions as digital finance continues to expand. The BU study underscores a pivotal point: crypto-enabled finance can either strengthen Brazil’s fintech leadership or pressure its currency and capital markets.

Bullish Aim Sdn. Bhd., chaired and owned by His Royal Highness Tunku Ismail Ibni Sultan Ibrahim, the Regent of Johor, announced the launch of RMJDT, a ringgit-backed stablecoin issued on Zetrix, the Layer-1 blockchain that powers Malaysia’s national Malaysia Blockchain Infrastructure. The rollout took place under the supervision of the country’s regulated sandbox , which is overseen by both the Securities Commission and Bank Negara Malaysia, to test financial innovations ranging from stablecoins to programmable payment systems. Malaysia's central bank will explore asset tokenization and digital assets, collaborating with the private sector on potential use cases for tokenized deposits and CBDCs. #BankNegaraMalaysia #CBDC https://t.co/FAnsrg2yY6 — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) March 24, 2025 Crown Prince Drives RMJDT Rollout With $121M Digital Asset Reserve RMJDT is intended to strengthen the ringgit’s profile in cross-border settlements and attract foreign direct investment, echoing Malaysia’s broader push into tokenization and digital-asset modernization. The Crown Prince said the initiative is part of Johor’s effort to align with the country’s Digital Asset National Policy, which encourages real-world asset tokenization and experiments in supply-chain finance. Alongside the stablecoin launch, Bullish Aim confirmed plans to establish a Digital Asset Treasury Company with an initial allocation of 500 million ringgit, roughly $121 million, in Zetrix tokens. The firm intends to expand the treasury to one billion ringgit over time. The treasury will be used to stabilize gas fees for RMJDT transactions and to support up to 10% of validator nodes within the national blockchain infrastructure. The move draws inspiration from high-profile corporate treasury strategies such as those employed by Strategy, which has accumulated more than 660,000 Bitcoin since 2020. Additionally, Ismail’s reported $2.7 billion bid for a land deal in Singapore back in August shows how some well-capitalized players are still willing to take major swings, even as worries grow about others mimicking the same strategies. The Regent of Johor said the Zetrix reserve was necessary to ensure predictable operations and tighter alignment with the national blockchain. Source: CoinGecko The launch comes at a time when Zetrix trades around $12.60, well below its peak above $20 recorded roughly a year earlier, according to CoinGecko data. Malaysia Ramps Up Crypto Treasuries Even as Global Inflows Slow The timing also places Johor’s initiative inside a broader regional shift. In recent months, Malaysia has seen a series of digital-asset treasury announcements. On November 12, VCI Global said it would acquire $100 million worth of OOB tokens in a deal that will make Tether the company’s largest shareholder. VCI Global has announced plans to acquire $100 million worth of OOB tokens, the native asset of Tether-backed crypto payments company Oobit. #Malaysia #Crypto https://t.co/OLLT57dQ9T — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) November 12, 2025 VCI Global plans to fold the token into its AI and fintech platforms and establish its own digital treasury division. The firm had already purchased $50 million worth of tokens through a restricted share issuance and intends to buy another $50 million on the secondary market after Oobit completes its migration from Ethereum to Solana. These developments are unfolding as Malaysia’s regulators accelerate reforms to support a more active digital-asset ecosystem . @SecComMalaysia proposes regulatory enhancements to the digital asset exchange framework by accelerating token listings. #DigitalAssets #Malaysia https://t.co/EV3L8ir6m1 — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) July 1, 2025 The Securities Commission has proposed an overhaul of exchange rules after trading volumes more than doubled in 2024 to nearly 14 billion ringgit. The new framework would allow certain tokens to be listed without prior approval, provided they meet strict criteria, while requiring operators to adopt tighter governance and risk controls. Source: DefiLlama But the broader digital-asset treasury sector is showing signs of fatigue. Data from DefiLlama shows corporate crypto treasuries recorded their slowest month of the year in November, with inflows dropping to $1.32 billion, down sharply from September’s peak. Galaxy Research described the market as entering a “Darwinian phase,” with leverage unraveling and several treasury-backed stocks trading at deep discounts. Even major players like Strategy, despite adding nearly $1 billion in Bitcoin last week, have seen their equity fall more than 35% over the past month.

55563226,642885,1765305469,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/55563226.jpeg,US Banks Cleared For ‘Riskless’ Crypto Transactions Following OCC Letter,https://bitcoinist.com/us-banks-riskless-crypto-transactions-occ-letter/,"In a new major breakthrough for the digital asset industry in the United States, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) announced on Tuesday that national banks are permitted to engage in “riskless principal transactions” involving crypto-assets. This confirmation comes through the issuance of Interpretive Letter 1188, which outlines the guidelines for such activities. OCC’s New Framework According to the OCC’s guidance , acting as a riskless principal for crypto-assets aligns with the services that national banks already offer to custody customers. National banks are now allowed to buy and sell both financial and non-financial assets held in custody based on customer directions, adhering to existing agreements and legal requirements. Therefore, facilitating the buying and selling of digital assets for custody customers in a riskless principal capacity is essentially the same as acting as an agent for those customers, and it is acknowledged as a legitimate banking activity. This new framework means that customers can transact in crypto-assets through established national banks, providing a more regulated environment compared to exchanges that operate outside the purview of strict financial oversight. Key Concern For Banks In Crypto Transactions The OCC also distinguished between riskless principal transactions in digital assets and those in traditional securities. The primary differences lie in the underlying assets and the technology used to facilitate these transactions. The main concern associated with riskless principal transactions is counterparty credit risk, especially settlement risk. Similarly, in customer-driven, perfectly matched derivative transactions that utilize transitory title transfer, credit risk is the predominant factor. In the letter, the OCC concluded the following: As with any activity, a bank that conducts riskless principal crypto-asset transactions must do so in a safe and sound manner and in compliance with applicable law. The OCC will examine riskless principal crypto-asset activities as part of its ongoing supervisory process.

This development marks a pivotal moment for the token’s visibility and accessibility, potentially opening the doors to millions of new investors. But what does this listing truly mean for the market and for you? Let’s dive into the details. Why is Coinbase Listing WET a Big Deal? When Coinbase decides to list WET , it’s not just adding another asset to its roster. This action serves as a powerful signal of credibility and potential. Coinbase employs a rigorous review process, meaning the WET token has met specific standards for security, compliance, and project legitimacy. Therefore, this listing can significantly boost investor confidence and liquidity for the token, integrating it into a mainstream financial gateway used by both retail and institutional players. What is the WET Token? Before we explore the impact, it’s crucial to understand what WET represents. While details can vary, tokens like WET typically function within specific blockchain ecosystems. They might offer utility such as: Governance rights within a decentralized platform Access to exclusive services or features A means of transaction or reward in a particular network The decision for Coinbase to list WET suggests the project has demonstrated real-world use cases and a sustainable model, moving beyond mere speculation. What Are the Immediate Benefits for Investors? The immediate effect of Coinbase’s announcement is increased accessibility. Users of the platform can now easily buy, sell, and store WET alongside major cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum. This integration offers several key advantages: Enhanced Liquidity: Easier trading often leads to better price discovery and lower volatility. Improved Security: Assets held on reputable exchanges benefit from robust security measures. Simplified Onboarding: New users can purchase WET directly with fiat currency, removing technical barriers. However, it’s vital to remember that listing on a major exchange also brings heightened scrutiny and regulatory attention. Could This Listing Shape Future Crypto Trends? Absolutely. Coinbase’s choice to list WET may indicate a broader trend of exchanges supporting tokens with strong fundamental utility over purely meme-driven assets. This could encourage other projects to focus on building tangible products and governance structures to attract similar partnerships. For the wider market, it reinforces the maturation of the crypto space, where established platforms act as gatekeepers for quality and innovation. What Should Potential Investors Consider Next? If you’re considering the WET token after hearing Coinbase will list WET , conduct thorough research. Look beyond the hype and examine the project’s whitepaper, development team, community activity, and long-term roadmap. Understand the token’s specific role within its ecosystem. Remember, while a Coinbase listing is a strong positive indicator, it does not guarantee profits, and the crypto market remains inherently volatile. Conclusion: A Step Toward Mainstream Integration The announcement that Coinbase will list WET is more than a routine update; it’s a testament to the evolving landscape of digital assets. It bridges innovative blockchain projects with mainstream financial infrastructure, offering both validation and opportunity. For the WET project, it’s a milestone of achievement.

Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: When exactly will Coinbase list WET? A1: Coinbase has announced the intent to list WET. The exact date and trading pairs (like WET-USD or WET-BTC) are usually confirmed in a follow-up announcement closer to the launch. Keep an eye on Coinbase’s official blog and social channels for the specific timeline. Q2: Will WET be available on all Coinbase platforms? A2: Typically, when Coinbase lists a new asset, it becomes available on Coinbase.com and the Coinbase mobile app. It may also be integrated into Coinbase Pro (Advanced Trade) for more experienced traders, but this is confirmed upon the full launch announcement. Q3: Is my existing WET token compatible with Coinbase?

The news comes as Russia prepares to expand investor access to derivatives based on digital assets and allow issuers to link them directly to cryptocurrencies. MOEX registers record high crypto futures volume The crypto futures trading volume on Moscow Exchange (MOEX) approached 49 billion rubles last month, Russia’s largest stock market announced, quoted by local media. High volatility in cryptocurrency markets contributed to the increased interest among Russian qualified investors, the trading platform’s press service explained, detailing: “As a result, the trading volume of such futures in November reached an all-time high since the contracts were launched, amounting to 48.7 billion rubles ($636 million).” According to a report by the TASS news agency, MOEX also said the total trading volume on its derivatives market, as a whole, reached 11.7 trillion rubles, as of the end of the month, a 15.8% increase compared to November 2024. The volume of the open positions in its exchange-traded derivatives market stood at more than 2.7 trillion rubles, up 22.7% over the same period of last year. More than 135,000 clients traded futures and options on the exchange, and private individuals accounted for almost 55% of the total trading volume in exchange-traded derivatives. Commodity futures had the largest share of their trades, almost 44%, followed by index and stock derivatives, with a little over 31%, and currency derivatives with around 25%. Russia’s crypto investment market prepares for growth The report from MOEX comes as Russian authorities prepare to fully legalize and regulate crypto investments in the coming months. The outgoing year brought significant changes in the attitudes of financial regulators in Moscow towards the nascent market. First, in March, the Central Bank of Russia (CBR) proposed a three-year “experimental legal regime” (ELR) for crypto transactions, including investments. The arrangement allows Russian companies involved in cross-border trade to use cryptocurrencies for international settlements. It also grants professional investors access to the digital assets. Then, in May, the monetary authority allowed financial firms to offer crypto derivatives to the same category of “highly qualified” investors. These instruments are currently based mainly on foreign crypto indices and exchange-traded funds (ETFs), but the bank’s latest plan is to permit products directly linked to digital coins. The Moscow Exchange was among the first to announce a Bitcoin futures contract based on a fund tracking the price of Bitcoin (BTC), BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF (IBIT), back in June. Last month, MOEX launched crypto index futures as well, including on Ethereum (ETH). The CBR has also indicated it intends to authorize commercial banks to operate with cryptocurrencies and let mutual funds invest in crypto assets. In October, the regulator urged lawmakers to adopt legislation tailored to regulate crypto investments outside the restrictive ELR. Last week, it confirmed it’s discussing easing the requirements for investors with the Ministry of Finance, which will add more participants to the market. In late November, the Bank of Russia estimated that household investments in Russian crypto derivatives had reached 3.7 billion rubles (almost $47.3 million) in Q2 and Q3 of 2025. It concluded that this level poses no risk to the country’s financial stability.

The report confirmed that the exchange holds sufficient assets to cover user liabilities fully and that it continues to prioritise overcollateralised holdings and transparent reporting as central pillars of its operational framework. Independent PoR reporting has become increasingly rare across the exchange sector, with many large trading platforms shifting to internal dashboards or discontinuing PoR audits. Binance stopped external audits after Mazars halted cooperation in 2022. OKX, Bybit, and Kraken provide internal cryptographic proofs or attestations rather than independent audits. KuCoin offers an internal PoR dashboard, and Coinbase, despite being publicly audited as a listed company, does not publish PoR at all. In contrast, the Hacken audit of MEXC offers a full-scope assessment of exchange’s on-chain and off-exchange liabilities covering wallet ownership, reserve ratios, and user obligations across a broad range of networks. According to the audit’s results, MEXC’s holdings in BTC, ETH, USDT, USDC, and other supported assets exceeded 100% of its corresponding liabilities. The Hacken assessment also validated outbound transactional proofs, confirming MEXC’s cryptographic and operational control over the wallets included in the audit. These have become a standard for exchanges seeking to verify wallet ownership without relying solely on static snapshots.The audit also incorporated a Merkle-tree verification of liabilities, enabling users and auditors to anonymously confirm that their individual account balances are included in the total obligations assessed by the reviewer. This structure is widely regarded as one of the more transparent approaches to PoR because it provides a method for reconciling exchange-level liabilities with user-level entries. However, adoption has stalled in the past year due to technical and operational complexity. The Hacken audit forms part of MEXC’s push for greater operational transparency for its global user base. The exchange has expanded its reserve reporting practices throughout 2024 and 2025 to meet heightened expectations from users and regulators for ongoing solvency verification. In the announcement, the platform revealed that its updated Proof of Reserve framework provides a “fully auditable view” of user balances without exposing personal data by relying on anonymized snapshots mapped to publicly visible on-chain holdings. A spokesperson for Hacken stated that the audit reflects the broader shift toward verifiable transparency among crypto exchanges: “We’ve seen increased transparency demand in the crypto industry over the past year, and the results of MEXC’s audit reflect this shift. In an environment where trust is built only through verifiable data, MEXC demonstrates its willingness to operate transparently and back up its commitments with facts, not words”. MEXC COO Vugar Usi, who joined the exchange earlier this month , said transparency and solvency verification are becoming standard expectations for global crypto trading platforms. He added: “At MEXC, we are fully committed to transparency and security, and this report once again demonstrates our unwavering dedication to 100% user fund safety. Independent Proof of Reserves audits are now a continuous, core standard practice within our operational framework. We will continue working with established auditing firms such as Hacken to ensure our users have verifiable assurance that their assets are fully backed”. While Proof of Reserves do not capture every element of exchange risk, independent verification of asset ownership and liabilities is one of the few tools available for assessing solvency without relying solely on internal claims. Industry observers have long debated the need for standardized PoR frameworks, but progress has been uneven and often dependent on exchanges' voluntary participation. In that environment, comprehensive audits such as Hacken’s provide data points that remain scarce across the market. Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

For enthusiasts within the Solana community, the introduction of JTO marks a significant event, as it empowers users to govern one of the network’s largest liquid staking protocols. Undoubtedly, those engaged with the protocol will be keenly interested in the token. Another critical factor influencing predictions for Jito’s price in 2025 is the progress of the Jito protocol itself. While there’s no specific roadmap to anticipate upcoming enhancements, unveiling a future roadmap or declaration of forthcoming developments could significantly boost interest in the token. Why is the JTO up today? JTO’s price gained buying pressure around local lows, resulting in an upward correction. This created a surge toward $0.45. Will the JTO price recover? If buyers hold above the $1 level, we might see a comeback in buying demand. Will JTO reach $10? JTO price might reach the $10 mark in 2025 if buying demand surges and Jito attracts altcoin investors. However, our JTO price prediction states it might reach the $10 level by 2026. Will the JTO price reach $100? Due to the effort of the Solana community, JITO Coin’s prices will continue to increase. However, there is no indication that the JITO (JTO) Coin will reach $100 soon, which is a short-term target. Is JTO a good long-term investment? JTO tokens have gained popularity thanks to strong community support through airdrops, benefiting the Solana ecosystem. However, conducting thorough research into their long-term potential is crucial to determine if they represent a viable long-term investment.

Phase 1 was an incredible success, selling out 10 million tokens and raising $500,000 in just over one week. This energy has carried over, with total funds raised now surging past the $1 million milestone from a rapidly expanding community of over 2,100 investors . As a fully decentralized ecosystem, GeeFi is resonating with users who value security and ownership. The excitement is so intense that analysts are now forecasting the upcoming Phase 3 will sell out in under 10 days , fueled by strong rumors of imminent major exchange listings. The Superior Choice for Explosive Growth While established players like Solana (SOL) trade in the $133-$135 range with support at $131 , investors seeking monumental gains are turning to GeeFi. GeeFi is a complete, non-custodial ecosystem designed to meet the real-world needs of the modern user. At its foundation is the GeeFi Wallet , a powerful mobile application that grants users full control over their private keys, providing a level of security that centralized platforms cannot offer. The app is already available on Android , with an iOS version in development to serve an even broader audience. The GeeFi ecosystem, however, is far more than just a secure wallet. It integrates a sophisticated Decentralized Exchange (DEX) that supports over 14 networks , enabling seamless asset swaps and cross-chain bridging. The highly anticipated GeeFi Crypto Card is also set to revolutionize how users interact with their digital assets, allowing for global spending via the VISA and Mastercard networks. Developed by the GeeFi Team since 2023 , this utility-driven platform is built for tangible, everyday use. An Unprecedented Presale Opportunity The GeeFi presale is engineered to deliver extraordinary returns to its early backers. The project is currently in Phase 2 , with tokens available for the incredibly low price of $0.06 . This rock-bottom entry point has created a buying frenzy, as the confirmed listing price of $0.40 locks in a 667% return for presale investors at launch. The potential for wealth generation is immense: an investment of just $1,200 today could explode to $40,000 if GEE hits a conservative $2 valuation , a staggering 3,233% ROI . With Phase 2 now over 80% sold out , having raised an additional $750,000 from 12.5 million tokens sold, the window to invest is rapidly closing. Maximize Your Gains with High-Yield Staking GeeFi delivers some of the most competitive and sustainable yields on the market, creating a powerful incentive for long-term investors. By locking GEE tokens for 12 months, users can earn a massive 55% APR . For those who prefer more flexibility, the platform offers shorter lock-up periods, including 22% APR for three months and 15% APR for one month. In a standout feature, GeeFi also provides up to 10% APR for staking with no lock-up period, allowing users to earn passive income while maintaining full liquidity. The rewards don’t stop with staking. GeeFi’s lucrative referral program gives users a 5% bonus in GEE tokens for every single purchase made through their unique referral link. This approach fosters organic community growth and generously rewards early adopters who help expand the ecosystem. The 100x Gem You Cannot Afford to Miss Every bull cycle has its breakout stars, and all signs indicate that GeeFi is poised to be one of them. Its incredible presale velocity and real-world utility have captured the market’s imagination. Analysts are calling it a potential 100x gem , recognizing its unique combination of a finished product, a clear roadmap, and staggering ROI potential. The presale is your last chance to secure a position at a ground-floor price before the token hits major exchanges and its value skyrockets. With Phase 2 selling out at an unprecedented rate, the fear of missing out is justified. Secure your spot in the next crypto disruptor before this opportunity is gone forever.

Hash Ribbons Flash New Buy Signal,https://www.newsbtc.com/bitcoin-news/bitcoin-opportunity-zone-hash-flash-new-buy/,"On-chain data shows the popular Bitcoin Hash Ribbons indicator has just given a miner capitulation signal. Here’s what this could mean. Bitcoin Hash Ribbons Now Signaling Miner Stress As pointed out by CryptoQuant author Darkfrost in an X post, the Bitcoin Hash Ribbons have shown a crossover that has historically corresponded to rising stress among the miners. The Hash Ribbons indicator aims to gauge the situation of the miners by comparing the 30-day and 60-day moving averages (MAs) of the BTC Hashrate, a metric that measures the total amount of computing power that the validators as a whole have connected to the blockchain. Related Reading: Bitcoin Speculation Muted: Glassnode Analyst Calls Perps A ‘Ghost Town’ The trend in the Hashrate can act as a representation of the sentiment among the miners, as they usually expand computing power (an increase in the Hashrate) when mining is profitable and/or they believe BTC is heading toward a bullish outcome, while they decommission mining rigs (a drop in the Hashrate) when they are having a hard time breaking even. The Hash Ribbons indicator basically captures shifts between these two behaviors. When the 30-day ribbon falls below the 60-day one, it means miners are reducing power at a fast rate. This can be a sign that this group is going through capitulation. Such a crossover has recently formed again for Bitcoin, as the chart below shared by Darkfrost shows. Thus, it would appear that miners are once again in a phase of capitulation. “Historically, these periods of mining stress have been profitable for Bitcoin investors, with one exception during the 2021 mining ban in China,” noted the analyst. The signal doesn’t act as a straightforward buy indicator, however, as mining capitulation often doesn’t directly coincide with a bottom. “In the short term, these periods tend to be bearish because miners may need to increase their selling to cover production costs,” explained Darkfrost. In general, miner capitulation periods have tended to lead into profitable buying windows for the cryptocurrency, although it’s unpredictable how long such a phase would last. From the chart, it’s apparent that sometimes the Hash Ribbons signal has been quite brief, while other times it has been maintained for weeks. As for what has forced miners to turn off Hashrate recently, the answer likely lies in the bearish trajectory that Bitcoin has witnessed. Miners obtain their reward in BTC denomination, so how the USD value of the coin fluctuates directly affects their dollar revenue. Related Reading: XRP Selloff: Whales Shed Coins Worth $1 Billion In A Week Before this, miners had been in a phase of rapid expansion alongside the bull rally, which had led to an explosion in the network’s mining Difficulty. With the price plummeting and Difficulty being at extraordinary levels, miners have faced a double whammy during the past month. BTC Price Bitcoin saw a recovery above $92,000 on Monday, but it would appear that the asset wasn’t able to maintain it, as its price is now back at $90,300.

He also explained how the altcoin and Ripple’s RLUSD stablecoin work hand in hand rather than being competitors on the network. Ripple XRP’s Role In Enabling Tokenization On The XRPL In an X post , Pumpius stated that XRP handles cross-border liquidity and deep global routing while Ripple’s RLUSD supports domestic flows, tokenized assets, and institutional balance sheets. This came as he noted that pairing XRP with RLUSD creates a two-asset settlement engine in the push for tokenization on the XRPL. The crypto pundit further stated that both XRP and Ripple’s RLUSD unlock instant settlement for tokenized assets, atomic swaps, capital-efficient markets, and unified liquidity across the entire XRPL ecosystem . He asserted that without instant, programmable, and compliant settlement, tokenized assets are nothing more than digital placeholders. Pumpius remarked that this is where Ripple’s RLUSD becomes transformative. He explained that the stablecoin is the operational backbone for real-world assets on the XRP Ledger. The crypto pundit added that it is the first dollar that settles at XRPL speed with institutional-grade transparency and regulatory alignment. In line with this, Pumpius reiterated that tokenization is useless without settlement. While RLUSD fixes the settlement problem, he stated that XRP amplifies it and that the emerging ZK layer will protect it. Regarding the ZK layer, the pundit stated that as private ZK infrastructure begins to anchor the XRPL identity, privacy and compliance layers will slot into this model, making settlement fast, verifiable, and shielded when needed. He declared that settlement, privacy, and compliant identity are the final form institutions have been waiting for before they begin tokenizing on the XRP Ledger. Notably, Ripple has already included introducing privacy features on the network into its roadmap. Ripple CTO Defends XRP And XRPL In an X post , Ripple CTO David Schwartz defended XRP and the XRPL after the altcoin was described as being “extremely centralized” because it is permissioned. Schwartz rebutted the statement that it was permissioned, noting that no one needs, or could have, any special permission to issue or execute XRPL transactions . He further stated that XRP is unpermissioned for the same reason Bitcoin is. He added that if anyone were to exercise control over the network in a way that is perceived as unfair, everyone else would change whatever was needed to regain fairness. The Ripple CTO also mentioned that, over more than a decade, no XRP transaction has been censored. At the same time, he claimed that Bitcoin miners routinely delay transactions they disfavor for any reason. At the time of writing, the XRP price is trading at around $2.05, down in the last 24 hours, according to data from CoinMarketCap.",XRP|Altcoin|bitcoin|Coinmarketcap|David Schwartz|Pumpius|ripple|RLUSD|stablecoin|XRP Ledger|XRP news|XRP price|XRPL|XRPUSD|XRPUSDT|ZK Layer,EN,0,0,ALTCOIN|BTC|MARKET|XRP|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-12-09 19:00:17

The asset has held a wide consolidation zone for months , and this behavior has created a growing debate among analysts. Many traders now question whether this pattern signals exhaustion or the early stages of a powerful expansion. The discussion gained fresh energy after a detailed fractal-based analysis by Egrag Crypto, who believes XRP is closer to a revaluation phase than many expect. His position has sparked careful examination because fractals can reveal strong possibilities, yet they require disciplined interpretation. Fractals and XRP’s Current Structure Fractal analysis examines how market patterns repeat or rhyme over extended cycles. These structures rarely duplicate perfectly, but they often reveal strong directional clues. Egrag Crypto argues that XRP has completed a long and stable accumulation period. He highlights the extended sideways base and the asset’s persistent refusal to break down. This behavior is common in assets preparing for major repricing phases. XRP’s chart now resembles a compressed spring that draws energy rather than losing strength . If this compression resolves to the upside, the move could unfold with remarkable speed. #XRP – Fractal Based TA is Dangerous : Look at the structure…..: A long sideways base Price refusing to break down ( Until Now). This is the kind of behavior that usually comes before a repricing phase, not after The fractal suggests a simple outcome:… pic.twitter.com/pLhAqoZS60 — EGRAG CRYPTO (@egragcrypto) December 9, 2025 Projected Targets and Historical Alignment The fractal model suggests expansion rather than continued stagnation. Egrag Crypto outlines a potential progression that could carry XRP toward $7, $12, and later $15 . These levels align with historic breakout zones and major Fibonacci extensions. XRP has followed similar patterns during past cycles, especially after multi-month accumulation phases. The structure also matches the broader market timing for the extended 2025–2026 crypto cycle. This timing is important because XRP often accelerates once Bitcoin’s cycle matures. The combination of long-term consolidation and cyclical alignment strengthens the bullish narrative, although it still demands evidence from price action. Why Fractal-Based TA Requires Caution Fractal analysis offers powerful insights but carries serious limitations. Market conditions never repeat exactly, and pattern similarity can create misleading confidence. Traders can easily fall into bias, especially when they anchor to optimistic targets. Liquidity dynamics also evolve each cycle, which can influence speed and scale. Macro events may shift timing, and this can break clean fractal alignments. Anchoring to expected targets can stop traders from responding to real invalidation signals. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Egrag Crypto emphasizes that fractals reveal possibilities, and not guaranteed outcomes. This context is important because XRP’s bullish structure remains valid only while key support holds. The Importance of the $2 Weekly Zone XRP continues to hover near the $2.08 region, and this area now serves as critical weekly support. Egrag stresses that the bullish roadmap remains active as long as this zone holds. A sustained defense here signals strength, especially after months of sideways movement. XRP has shown similar compression before large breakouts in earlier cycles. The structure remains neutral to bullish because it continues to coil tightly rather than breaking down. This coiling suggests energy is building for a decisive move, and history shows XRP can move extremely fast once expansion begins. Balanced Outlook for the Coming Cycle A breakout requires more than historical resemblance. Traders must watch structural signals, volume behavior, and broader crypto conditions. A move above resistance near $3 would confirm early strength. A break above $3.50 would fully validate the expansion thesis. Failure to hold the $2 region would weaken the entire fractal model and force reassessment. XRP’s next phase will depend on real-time reactions to these levels. Patience and logical analysis remain essential as the market approaches the next cycle. In conclusion, XRP stands at a critical moment that blends opportunity and caution. Egrag Crypto’s fractal-based analysis highlights a strong possibility of significant expansion after a long accumulation phase. The projected targets between $7 and $15 remain plausible within this structure. However, fractals show potential paths rather than fixed outcomes. The $2 support zone must hold, and traders must respond to evolving conditions with discipline. XRP may be coiling for its next major move, but the final direction will depend on real market catalysts, not pattern expectations.

The launch was revealed in a video shared on Tuesday, where Secretary of War Pete Hegseth said the system is meant to give U.S. personnel direct access to artificial intelligence tools to help, in his words, “revolutionize the way we win.” Pete said, “The future of American warfare is here, and it’s spelled AI.” He followed that by warning that rivals are also moving fast with new tech, adding, “As technologies advance, so do our adversaries. But here at the War Department, we are not sitting idly by.” He confirmed that Google Gemini is the first model being deployed and that these systems are now placed “directly into the hands of every American warrior.” Pentagon expands AI access across defense staff Pete said GenAI.mil allows users to run deep research, format documents, and analyze video and imagery at high speed with one click. He said the tools allow intelligence work and admin tasks to move faster and with less manual load. He also said the project does not end with this launch and that the department plans to keep pushing new systems into service. “We will continue to aggressively field the world’s best technology to make our fighting force more lethal than ever before,” he said. He added that the platform runs only on U.S.‑built technology, saying, “And all of it is American‑made.” Pete closed his message with, “The possibilities with AI are endless. Now, let’s get to work.” Under Secretary of War for Research and Engineering Emil Michael followed with his own statement. He said, “There is no prize for second place in the global race for AI dominance.” Michael confirmed fast deployment across government staff, saying, “We are moving rapidly to deploy powerful AI capabilities like Gemini for Government directly to our workforce.” He added one more line tied to U.S. power and scale: “AI is America’s next Manifest Destiny, and we’re ensuring that we dominate this new frontier.” Google CEO Sundar Pichai also commented on the deal. He said Google has worked with government agencies for years, but stressed that this rollout is different in size and reach. “Through this deployment of Google Cloud’s Gemini for Government offering, more than 3 million civilian and military personnel will be able to access the same advanced AI that businesses use every day to drive administrative efficiency and greater business productivity,” Pichai said. He added that the systems are hosted inside Google’s secure infrastructure and called it “a significant step in accelerating AI adoption across the public sector.” The launch follows President Donald Trump’s release of America’s AI Action Plan, which the White House said listed nearly 100 federal actions to speed up U.S. innovation in artificial intelligence. Alongside access, the Pentagon confirmed it will give free training on GenAI.mil so staff can learn how to use the platform with confidence. The system is web‑grounded against Google Search to limit hallucinations and false outputs.

Goldman Sachs Chief Financial Officer Denis Coleman has placed a significant bet on monetary policy, forecasting a Fed rate cut of 25 basis points on Wednesday. For those watching the crypto markets, this isn’t just traditional finance news—it’s a potential catalyst for the next major move in digital assets. Why Does a Fed Rate Cut Matter for Crypto? When the Federal Reserve adjusts interest rates, it sends ripples through every financial market. A Fed rate cut typically makes borrowing cheaper. This action can weaken the U.S. dollar and push investors to seek higher returns in alternative assets. Historically, such environments have been favorable for risk-on investments like technology stocks and, crucially, cryptocurrencies. Therefore, Goldman Sachs’s prediction isn’t just about bonds; it’s about the flow of capital into Bitcoin and beyond. Decoding Goldman Sachs’s Full Forecast Denis Coleman’s outlook provides a roadmap beyond this week. He expects the initial Fed rate cut to be followed by a pause at the start of 2025, then two additional cuts later that year. This phased approach suggests a cautious but deliberate shift in policy. For crypto, this implies a sustained period where traditional “safe” yields are less attractive, potentially driving a long-term rotation into digital assets. The forecast hinges on continued progress on inflation, a key metric the Fed watches closely. What Are the Immediate Implications? If the Fed acts as predicted, we could see several immediate effects: Market Sentiment Shift: A cut is often read as a supportive move for risk assets, boosting overall investor confidence. Dollar Dynamics: A lower interest rate can pressure the U.S. Dollar Index (DXY), which has an inverse relationship with Bitcoin’s price. Liquidity Flow: Easier monetary policy increases system liquidity, some of which historically finds its way into the crypto ecosystem. Navigating the Crypto Market After the Decision While a Fed rate cut is generally seen as positive, savvy investors know the reaction is never guaranteed. The key is in the messaging—the “dot plot” and Fed Chair Jerome Powell’s press conference will dictate whether markets view this as a one-off adjustment or the start of a full easing cycle. Crypto traders should watch for: Bitcoin’s reaction to the news, especially around key resistance levels. Performance of crypto-related stocks and the Nasdaq, as they often lead crypto sentiment. Any mention of financial stability or digital assets by the Fed, which could hint at future regulatory stances. The Bigger Picture: A New Macro Regime for Crypto? This potential pivot by the Fed marks a possible end to the aggressive hiking cycle that defined 2022 and 2023—a period that included the crypto winter. A shift to cutting rates could validate the thesis that cryptocurrencies thrive in environments with ample liquidity and lower real yields. It reinforces crypto’s growing role as a macro asset, sensitive to the same central bank policies as gold or equities. Actionable Insights for Investors Don’t just watch the headline. Prepare your strategy: Dollar-Cost Average (DCA): Volatility around Fed announcements is common. A steady DCA strategy can help navigate price swings. Monitor Altcoins: If Bitcoin benefits from a macro tailwind, capital often later flows into major altcoins like Ethereum. Assess Your Portfolio: Ensure your allocation aligns with a potentially higher-risk appetite in the market. In conclusion, Goldman Sachs’s forecast for a Fed rate cut is more than a prediction for bond traders. It is a beacon for cryptocurrency investors, highlighting a potential shift in the macroeconomic winds. While central bank decisions bring short-term volatility, they also create the foundational conditions for the next bull cycle. By understanding the link between interest rates and digital asset valuations, you can position your portfolio to not just react, but proactively adapt to a changing financial landscape. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: How quickly do crypto markets react to a Fed rate decision? A: Crypto markets, particularly Bitcoin, often react within minutes of the Fed’s announcement and Chair Powell’s subsequent comments. However, the full impact may unfold over several days as the market digests the long-term implications. Q2: Does a rate cut always make Bitcoin’s price go up? A: Not always. While a cut is generally positive, the market’s reaction depends on whether the move was already “priced in” and the Fed’s guidance for future policy. If the cut is seen as a response to economic weakness, it could initially cause risk-off sentiment. Q3: What other economic indicators should I watch with the Fed? A: Alongside the rate decision, pay close attention to the Consumer Price Index (CPI) for inflation, employment data, and the U.S. Dollar Index (DXY). These all influence the Fed’s decisions and, by extension, crypto market liquidity. Q4: How do Fed rate cuts affect Ethereum and other altcoins? A: Altcoins typically follow Bitcoin’s macro trend but with higher volatility. A positive macro environment from rate cuts can improve sentiment across the entire crypto sector, potentially leading to increased investment in altcoin projects. Q5: Should I change my long-term HODL strategy based on one Fed meeting? A: A single meeting should not drastically alter a sound long-term strategy. However, understanding these macro shifts can help you make informed decisions about entry points, portfolio rebalancing, and risk management. Q6: Where can I get reliable news on Fed decisions and crypto analysis? A: Follow official Fed communications and reputable financial news outlets. For crypto-specific analysis, seek out platforms with a track record of objective, macro-focused reporting. Found this analysis of the potential Fed rate cut and its crypto impact helpful?

That shift recasts payments as an API call , and it places public chains and stablecoins in the centre of a new transaction layer that never sleeps. The idea is not science fiction for distant horizons; it follows directly from how agents already fetch data, route tasks, and make bounded choices, which means a wallet simply gives those choices a way to clear. Once an agent can hold value, it can pay for compute, storage, and data, and it can accept income for work completed, such as labeling, scraping, modelling, or orchestration. The practical consequence lands in market microstructure rather than marketing slogans, because autonomous clients transact in small bursts at high frequency, and that behaviour rewards always-on rails with low fees, programmable controls, and finality that does not depend on banking hours. AI Agents and On-Chain Wallets An agent that operates through a browser or a scripted environment can generate an address, set spending rules, and move funds under policy constraints defined by its owner, and that capability removes the need for a traditional account in many machine contexts. Bitcoin and major stablecoins already settle value at any hour, and they provide deterministic outcomes that agents can reason about, which reduces operational risk for machine workflows. In this setting, the wallet becomes a permissions system as much as a purse, since owners can impose daily limits, permitted counterparties, and audit trails, while services can demand proof of funds, time-locked payments, or escrow before fulfilling requests. Machine wallets then pay other machines for access to GPUs, curated datasets, retrieval bandwidth, or specialised tools, with pricing expressed in tokens that settle quickly and atomically. A parallel economy can emerge from these loops, because agents often trade with other agents rather than with people, which creates a constant order flow that ties token liquidity to the cost of compute and the value of data.

A workable pattern places a verified human or company at the perimeter, delegates spend authority to an agent, and binds the wallet to controls that can be inspected, suspended, or revoked when thresholds or alerts trigger. Consumer protection fits into that model through disclosures and limits that mirror card frameworks, while anti-abuse controls track flows without forcing every low-value machine payment through manual review. Payment companies can bridge fiat and crypto by linking fiat balances to on-chain rails for settlement, and by allowing agents to draw against prefunded sources that are tied to known principals. The result is a system where Bitcoin and major stablecoins clear routine tasks and periodic invoices, banks remain central for fiat entry and exit, and auditability improves because policies live in code rather than policy binders.

Imagine your doorbell not just seeing who’s outside, but knowing exactly who they are. Amazon’s Ring has rolled out a controversial new AI-powered facial recognition feature that’s dividing opinions: is this smart home innovation or a step toward surveillance society? For cryptocurrency enthusiasts who value privacy and decentralization, this development raises critical questions about data ownership and corporate control. What is Amazon Ring’s AI Facial Recognition Feature? Amazon’s Ring video doorbells now include ‘Familiar Faces,’ an AI-powered feature that identifies regular visitors. The system creates a catalog of up to 50 faces including family, friends, delivery drivers, and household staff. Once labeled in the Ring app, the device recognizes these individuals and sends personalized notifications like ‘Mom at Front Door’ instead of generic alerts. The feature operates with several key characteristics: Not enabled by default – users must activate it manually Face data is encrypted according to Amazon Unnamed faces are automatically deleted after 30 days Users can edit, merge, or delete face labels at any time Alerts can be customized on a per-face basis Privacy Concerns Over AI Facial Recognition Technology The introduction of facial recognition to consumer doorbells has triggered significant backlash from privacy advocates and lawmakers. The Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF) and U.S. Senator Ed Markey have called for Amazon to abandon the feature, citing several alarming factors: Concern Details Law Enforcement Partnerships Amazon has history of sharing Ring data with police departments Security Breaches Ring paid $5.8 million FTC fine for unauthorized employee access to videos Data Exposure User passwords found on dark web, addresses leaked through Neighbors app Legal Restrictions Feature blocked in Illinois, Texas, and Portland due to privacy laws Amazon claims biometric data is processed in the cloud and not used to train AI models. The company also states it cannot identify all locations where a person has been detected, even if law enforcement requests this information. However, privacy experts question these assurances given Amazon’s partnerships with surveillance companies like Flock. Smart Home Security vs. Surveillance State The debate around Ring’s new feature centers on a fundamental question: where do we draw the line between security and surveillance? For cryptocurrency advocates familiar with privacy technologies, several aspects are particularly concerning: Centralized Data Control: Unlike decentralized systems, Amazon controls all facial recognition data Corporate-Government Collaboration: Amazon’s history of working with law enforcement raises red flags Lack of Transparency: Users cannot verify how their biometric data is processed or stored Expansion Potential: Features like ‘Search Party’ already allow neighborhood-wide camera searches Practical Implications for Video Doorbell Users For current Ring owners considering the AI facial recognition feature, several practical considerations emerge: Security Risks: Given Ring’s past security failures, biometric data could be vulnerable Privacy Trade-offs: Convenience comes at the cost of sharing sensitive facial data Legal Implications: Recording and identifying visitors may have legal consequences in some jurisdictions Alternative Approaches: Traditional video recording without facial recognition may offer better privacy protection Privacy experts recommend that if users enable the feature, they should avoid using real names for identification and regularly review their face catalog. Better yet, they suggest keeping the feature disabled entirely. The Future of AI in Home Security Amazon’s move represents a significant moment in smart home technology evolution. As AI capabilities expand, consumers face increasingly complex decisions about privacy versus convenience. The cryptocurrency community’s emphasis on self-sovereignty and data ownership provides valuable perspective on these developments. Key questions for the future include: Will decentralized alternatives emerge for home security? How will regulations evolve to protect biometric privacy? Can blockchain technology provide better solutions for secure, private home monitoring? What role should open-source alternatives play in this space? Amazon Ring’s AI facial recognition feature represents a watershed moment in consumer surveillance technology. While offering undeniable convenience for identifying regular visitors, it raises profound privacy concerns that should give every smart home owner pause. The feature’s optional nature provides some protection, but Amazon’s track record with data security and law enforcement partnerships suggests caution is warranted. For those in the cryptocurrency space who understand the importance of data sovereignty and privacy, this development serves as a reminder that not all technological advancements represent progress. Sometimes, the most innovative approach is knowing when to say no to features that compromise fundamental rights.

Frequently Asked Questions What companies are involved in this facial recognition controversy? The primary company is Amazon , through its Ring division. The feature also involves concerns about Amazon’s partnership with Flock Safety , a surveillance camera manufacturer used by law enforcement agencies. Who are the main critics of this feature? The Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF) has been vocal in opposing the feature. U.S. Senator Ed Markey (D-Mass.) has also called for Amazon to abandon the facial recognition technology. What government agencies have been involved with Ring previously? The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) fined Ring $5.8 million in 2023 for privacy violations. Amazon has also established partnerships with various law enforcement agencies through its Ring Neighbors program. Are there any legal restrictions on this feature? Yes, privacy laws in Illinois, Texas, and Portland, Oregon prevent Amazon from launching the facial recognition feature in those jurisdictions due to biometric privacy regulations.

The Autorité des Marchés Financiers (AMF) will update its rules to allow certain crypto investment products to be sold to retail investors. France joins the United Kingdom after the FCA also proposed plans to ease the restrictions on retail access to crypto exchange-traded notes. The French Financial Markets Authority’s (AMF) adjusted rules will allow retail marketing of crypto-indexed ETNs, removing warning-label requirements for eligible products, for the first time since it imposed a ban in October 2025. What changed in France’s crypto regulations? Regulators and major financial institutions across Europe are moving to expand retail investor access. Following the report, CoinShares revealed that its physical platform led the European crypto ETP market with over $1 billion in net inflows year-to-date. “The U.S. led with spot ETF approvals, but Europe pioneered this sector, which we created with the first regulated Bitcoin ETP in 2015.” Jean-Marie Mognetti, the CEO of CoinShares, explained . He went on to say that the challenge has been the retail access rules, which vary dramatically from country to country and have prevented consistent adoption despite Europe’s ten-year head start. The AMF’s adjusted rules relate to the nature of crypto assets, like Bitcoin, Ether, and other crypto assets that meet requirements in terms of capitalization, average trading volume, and the regulated nature of the platforms where these crypto-assets can be traded. The AMF plans to review this change in policy in the first half of 2027. The UK is also changing its crypto investment rules Cryptopolitan previously reported that the Financial Conduct Authority intends to establish clearer distinctions between retail and professional investors as part of an initiative to strengthen Britain’s investment culture. The FCA announced its package of measures on December 8, aimed at giving firms more confidence when dealing with experienced clients. Under the proposals, firms will be able to operate with professional investors outside the restrictions of retail regulations, including the Consumer Duty. Only individuals with at least £10 million in cash can opt out of consumer duty protections, while firms must demonstrate that clients provide informed consent to this arrangement. For ordinary investors, the FCA is replacing the European Union Packaged Retail and Insurance-based Investment Products (PRIIPs) and UCITS disclosure requirements with a new Consumer Composite Investments regime built around Consumer Duty principles. The new framework will take effect on June 8, 2027. “Today’s measures support investment risk culture right along the spectrum, ensuring retail customers receive material that informs and engages them, while giving professional markets a brighter line defined by contracting parties, informed consent, and proportionate oversight.” Simon Walls, the executive director of markets at the FCA, said. Following the UK’s crypto ETN decision, the London Stock Exchange listed several crypto ETNs from issuers such as 21Shares, WisdomTree, and ETC Group, which were previously available only to professional investors. These products can now be accessed by retail investors through regulated platforms. Crypto ETNs are also eligible to be held within pension schemes and Stocks & Shares ISAs. However, from April 2026, they will only qualify for inclusion within Innovative Finance ISAs. Nordea, Europe’s largest bank with €648 billion in assets under management, is set to offer CoinShares’ Bitcoin ETP starting in December 2025.

In this case, Standard Chartered and Bernstein have trimmed their near-term projections while keeping a broadly optimistic long-term stance. Standard Chartered, long known for its bullish outlook , has cut its forecasts amid a sharp decline in corporate treasury participation and slowing ETF inflows. The banking giant now expects Bitcoin to reach $150,000 by the end of 2026, down from its earlier $300,000 estimate. Its long-range target of $500,000 has also been pushed back to 2030. The bank noted that companies once viewed as major drivers of Bitcoin accumulation no longer have the valuations or incentives to continue adding the asset to their balance sheets, leaving ETFs as the primary source of institutional demand. “We think that Bitcoin buying by DATs has run its course, while we expect ETF inflows to resume periodically. We expect a consolidation rather than outright selling,” Geoffrey Kendrick, Standard Chartered’s global head of digital assets said. On the other hand, Bernstein now expects Bitcoin to hit $150,000 by the end of 2026 and approach $200,000 by late 2027. While recent price weakness prompted analysts to step back from an earlier call for a $200,000 peak this year, they argue that Bitcoin has matured beyond its traditional four-year boom-and-bust pattern, entering what they describe as a more sustained expansion phase. Their longer-term outlook remains highly bullish, with projections that the token could climb toward $1 million by 2033. Bitcoin price analysis The shift comes amid heightened market pressure with Bitcoin down nearly 30% from its October peak above $126,000.

This crucial legislation for crypto market structure may stall without a specific condition: the appointment of Democratic commissioners to key financial agencies. Let’s explore what this means for the industry and your investments. What is the CLARITY Act and Why Does It Matter? The CLARITY Act represents a landmark effort to create clear rules for the cryptocurrency industry. Its primary goal is to establish a definitive regulatory framework by clarifying the roles of two major agencies: the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC). Currently, confusion about which agency oversees different crypto assets creates uncertainty for businesses and investors alike. One of the bill’s most significant provisions would exempt certain cryptocurrencies from traditional securities registration requirements. Specifically, digital assets that meet defined conditions wouldn’t need to register under the Securities Act of 1933. This distinction is vital because it recognizes that some cryptocurrencies function more like commodities or currencies than traditional stocks or bonds. Why Are Democratic Commissioners Crucial for the CLARITY Act? During his appearance at the Blockchain Association’s policy conference, Senator Booker presented a compelling argument. He stated that appointing Democratic commissioners to both the SEC and CFTC is necessary to protect these agencies’ independence. This concern stems from potential influence by the current administration under President Trump. Booker’s position highlights several important considerations: Agency Independence: Regulatory bodies must operate without political pressure to ensure fair market oversight Bipartisan Support: Major legislation typically requires support from both political parties to pass successfully Long-term Stability: Regulations created with diverse perspectives tend to be more durable and effective What Challenges Does the CLARITY Act Currently Face? Despite the clear need for regulatory clarity, the path forward for this legislation contains several obstacles. The political landscape presents the most immediate challenge, as commissioner appointments have become increasingly contentious. Furthermore, different stakeholders within the cryptocurrency industry have varying opinions on what constitutes appropriate regulation. However, there’s reason for optimism. During a later panel discussion, Senator Booker expressed confidence that the CLARITY Act will eventually pass. This suggests that while there may be delays, the fundamental need for clear rules will ultimately drive legislative action. The growing mainstream adoption of cryptocurrencies adds pressure on lawmakers to establish a workable framework. How Will the CLARITY Act Impact Crypto Investors? For anyone involved in cryptocurrency, the outcome of this legislative effort carries substantial implications. Clear regulations would provide much-needed certainty about which assets fall under which regulatory umbrella. This clarity could encourage greater institutional investment, as large financial entities typically avoid markets with ambiguous rules. Consider these potential benefits of the CLARITY Act: Reduced Legal Uncertainty: Companies would know exactly what regulations apply to their operations Enhanced Consumer Protection: Clear rules help prevent fraud and market manipulation Innovation Support: Entrepreneurs could develop new products with confidence about regulatory treatment Market Stability: Established frameworks tend to reduce volatility caused by regulatory surprises The Road Ahead for Crypto Regulation Senator Booker’s comments reveal an important truth about cryptocurrency legislation: political considerations often influence technical policy decisions. The CLARITY Act addresses genuine market needs, but its progress depends on broader governmental dynamics. This situation isn’t unique to cryptocurrency; many technological innovations face similar regulatory growing pains. As the debate continues, several developments could accelerate progress. Increased public awareness of cryptocurrency benefits might generate constituent pressure on lawmakers. Additionally, if other countries establish clear regulatory frameworks, the United States may feel compelled to keep pace to maintain its financial leadership position. Conclusion: A Necessary Step Forward The CLARITY Act represents a crucial effort to bring order to the rapidly evolving cryptocurrency landscape. While Senator Booker has identified a specific political hurdle—the appointment of Democratic commissioners—the fundamental need for regulatory clarity remains urgent. This legislation would benefit all market participants by establishing clear rules and reducing uncertainty. As the political process unfolds, the cryptocurrency community should engage constructively with policymakers to help shape effective regulations that protect consumers while fostering innovation. Frequently Asked Questions What exactly does the CLARITY Act do? The CLARITY Act creates a regulatory framework for cryptocurrencies by clearly dividing oversight responsibilities between the SEC and CFTC. It also provides exemptions from securities registration for digital assets that meet specific conditions. Why does Senator Booker think Democratic commissioners are needed? Booker believes Democratic appointments to the SEC and CFTC are necessary to maintain these agencies’ independence from political influence, particularly from the current administration, which he sees as crucial for the CLARITY Act’s passage. Will the CLARITY Act definitely pass? While Senator Booker expressed confidence it will eventually pass, he acknowledged current political challenges. The legislation has significant support but faces hurdles related to commissioner appointments and broader political dynamics. How will this affect my cryptocurrency investments? Clear regulations generally benefit investors by reducing uncertainty and potentially attracting more institutional money to the space. However, specific impacts will depend on the final legislation’s details and how different cryptocurrencies are classified. What happens if the CLARITY Act doesn’t pass? Without clear federal legislation, cryptocurrency regulation would likely continue as a patchwork of state rules and agency guidance, creating ongoing uncertainty for businesses and investors in the space. When might we see movement on this legislation? Timing depends on political developments, particularly commissioner appointments to the SEC and CFTC. Movement could accelerate if there’s increased public pressure or if other countries advance their own crypto regulations. Found this analysis helpful?

The document clarifies that TradFi banks that had been dipping their toes in via pilots can now go for full-scale crypto integration. The OCC has, over time, reversed the cautionary approach it took between 2021 and 2024, when it imposed strict guardrails and joined the Fed in warning about crypto risks, such as liquidity and volatility. As it stands, only a few purely crypto banks like Anchorage Digital hold OCC charters. With today’s letter, more hybrids could start to emerge soon. The OCC’s letter gives banks the green light According to the letter from the OCC, traditional banks are explicitly permitted to engage in riskless principal crypto-asset transactions, where the banks act as matched intermediaries in trades without the need to hold assets. The letter clarifies that offering riskless principal crypto-asset transactions would benefit bank customers by providing them with more options and the ability to receive a service provided by a highly regulated bank. Customers would be able to transact crypto-assets via a regulated bank, as compared to non-regulated or less regulated options. Also, in offering these types of transactions, the bank becomes an intermediary between the customer and counterparties with whom the customer may have no relationship. This can help customers manage their exposure to unregulated crypto-asset exchanges and pseudonymous counterparties on such exchanges, as well as provide the operational capacity needed to undertake such transactions. The letter concluded by pointing out that, as with any activity, a bank that conducts riskless principal crypto-asset transactions must do so in a safe and sound manner and in compliance with applicable law. In the meantime, the OCC will examine riskless principal crypto-asset activities as part of its ongoing supervisory process. The OCC’s boss believes crypto could help TradFi evolve While at a blockchain conference on Monday, Jonathan Gould, the head of the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC), pointed out that “custody and safekeeping services have been happening electronically for decades” and so “there is simply no justification for considering digital assets differently.” In fact, he highlighted the importance of not confining banks, including current national trust banks, to “the technologies or businesses of the past.” As far as he is concerned, the banking system has the “capacity to evolve from the telegraph to the blockchain.” At the conference , he revealed that the OCC had received 14 applications to start a new bank so far this year, “including some from entities engaged in novel or digital asset activities,” which was nearly equal to the number of similar applications that the OCC received over the last four years. “Chartering helps ensure that the banking system continues to keep pace with the evolution of finance and supports our modern economy,” he added. “That is why entities that engage in activities involving digital assets and other novel technologies should have a pathway to become federally supervised banks.” And as for the concerns raised by banks and financial trade groups about crypto companies getting banking charters and the OCC’s ability to oversee them, Gould brushed those off. The OCC head insisted that such concerns “risk reversing innovations that would better serve bank customers and support local economies,” reiterating that the OCC already has years of experience supervising a crypto-native national trust bank, so there is little danger there.

This leadership coup comes at a critical juncture as OpenAI faces mounting pressure to transform its groundbreaking technology into sustainable revenue streams. For cryptocurrency and tech investors watching the AI sector, this appointment represents more than just executive shuffling—it’s a clear signal that OpenAI is serious about building a profitable business model around its revolutionary AI tools. Why OpenAI’s Chief Revenue Officer Appointment Matters The hiring of Denise Dresser as OpenAI’s chief revenue officer represents a pivotal moment in the company’s evolution. After years of focusing primarily on research and development, OpenAI is now placing significant emphasis on monetization and enterprise adoption. Dresser brings over 14 years of experience from Salesforce, Slack’s parent company, where she oversaw the integration of AI features into workplace productivity tools. Her appointment suggests OpenAI is preparing for a major push into business-to-business markets, potentially creating new revenue models that could influence how AI companies approach profitability. Denise Dresser’s Journey from Slack CEO to OpenAI Leadership Denise Dresser’s career trajectory demonstrates why she’s uniquely positioned for this critical role at OpenAI. During her tenure at Slack, she spearheaded the implementation of AI-powered features that enhanced workplace collaboration and productivity. This experience gives her valuable insights into how businesses actually use AI tools in daily operations. Her understanding of enterprise software adoption cycles, customer success strategies, and revenue generation in subscription-based models will be crucial as OpenAI navigates the complex landscape of enterprise AI adoption. Executive Previous Role New OpenAI Role Industry Experience Denise Dresser Slack CEO Chief Revenue Officer 14+ years at Salesforce/Slack Fidji Simo Instacart CEO CEO of Applications Tech leadership across multiple sectors The Enterprise AI Strategy Behind This Executive Move OpenAI’s decision to appoint a chief revenue officer with Dresser’s background reveals several strategic priorities: Enterprise Focus: OpenAI recognizes that sustainable revenue will come from business customers, not just individual users Integration Expertise: Dresser’s experience with Slack’s AI features positions her to help businesses integrate OpenAI tools into existing workflows Revenue Diversification: The company appears to be moving beyond API access fees toward more comprehensive enterprise solutions Customer Success: Her background suggests OpenAI will prioritize helping businesses achieve measurable results with AI Challenges Facing OpenAI’s New Chief Revenue Officer Despite the optimism surrounding this appointment, Denise Dresser faces significant challenges as OpenAI’s chief revenue officer.

What happens to Slack leadership? Slack’s chief product officer, Rob Seaman, will serve as interim CEO following Dresser’s departure to OpenAI. The company has not yet announced permanent leadership plans. Why is this appointment significant for the AI industry? This move signals that leading AI companies are shifting focus from pure research to sustainable business models. It highlights the growing importance of enterprise revenue in the AI sector and suggests increased competition for business customers.

The advancement in the Solana ETF and the presale of Mutuum Finance (MUTM) have revitalized the debate about the best cryptos to invest in. There has also been interest in the next big crypto cycles, causing traders to look for the best crypto to invest in ahead of the holiday rally. This makes Solana and MUTM very much on the radar of everyone watching their trends in the month of December. Solana ETF Momentum Strengthening Market Confidence There have been positive sentiment trends for Solana since Franklin Templeton obtained the approval for the listing of its Solana ETF on the NYSE Arca market under the ticker SOEZ. This index follows the CF Benchmarks Solana Index. Such news has resulted in a jump of about 17% in the price of SOL. SOEZ has a structure known as a grantor trust that involves shares of SOL and cash. At the same time, the goal of the structure involves tracking the price of SOL as well as yield. Meanwhile, the combination of custody supervision by Coinbase Custody Trust Company together with the administrative assistance of BNY has made the shares of SOL more accessible via a regulated medium. Though Solana remains a gravitational pull for developers, institutional investment in the form of ETFs is also influencing community sentiment regarding the top cryptos to invest in. Still, the long-term trend of Solana remains market-dependent in terms of overall rotations. There is a very well-defined distinction between the growth prospects of Solana and the presale gains of the MUTM presale. Mutuum Finance Presale Acceleration Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has also been in the limelight as the community moves closer to the end of presale Phase 6. This phase is already 98% full. This will be the last opportunity for investors to purchase the tokens at a cost of $0.035. Phase 7 will see the cost jump to $0.04. Since the presale started, the total amount of dollars raised for the Mutuum Finance has reached $19,200,000. Additionally, the number of holders has reached 18,380. All of these show the growing conviction of investors in determining the best cryptocurrency to invest in. The present value of the token showcases a 250% growth from the value of Phase 1, where the token cost $0.01. There has also been a surge in the FOMO effect given the rising demands of Phase 6. The last allocation at the current pricing tier will soon be exhausted. Current participants of the presale believe that the initial pricing of the token at $0.06 may offer a prospective gain of approximately 420%. Structured Growth, Protocol Progress And Investor Utility There has been significant progress in the Mutuum Finance (MUTM) V1 protocol launch scheduled for Q4 2025. This has improved investor sentiment, especially for individuals trying to determine the best cryptocurrency to invest in. The developers have announced the lending and borrowing services will be launched on the Sepolia testnet in Q4. The main elements of the service will also be launched in the initial launch phase. ETH would be the starting asset for the lending services. USDT would also act as a starting asset. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is also being audited by the reputable Halborn Security to ensure the reliability of its services. The code has been finished and put under scrutiny. Interest in the project has been rising steadily due to the comparisons of the next big crypto to explode compared to the young DeFi projects. Higher Incentives in the Month of December The interest in the best cryptos to invest in has surged in the month of December, but largely in terms of cryptos that have a more visible positive trajectory. An early entry into the market for a significantly less expensive cost in terms of a well-structured development rollout for the benefit of reaching the milestones in 2025 for a nearly sold-out Phase 6 of Mutuum Finance (MUTM) would be beneficial. Those positioning for the 2026 cycles will also realize the risks of entering late to miss the remaining allocation before the price goes up. Anyone considering the best crypto to buy needs to buy while it’s still early.

According to Santiment, more than 403,000 BTC have left exchanges since December 7, 2024 — roughly 2% of Bitcoin’s total supply. Related Reading: Banking Meets Bitcoin: French Banking Giant Offers Crypto To Millions That shift, measured against an on-exchange balance of about 2.11 million BTC in late November, is being seen as a sign that fewer coins are poised for quick sale. Exchange Balances Shrink Santiment said lower exchange balances have historically been linked with fewer sudden sell-offs, an observation many market watchers find encouraging. The math is straightforward: when a big chunk of supply sits outside exchanges, there is less immediately available stock to meet selling pressure. 📊 As Bitcoin’s market value hovers around $90K, crypto’s top market cap continues to see its supply moving away from exchanges. Over the past year, there has been: 📉 A net total of -403.2K $BTC moving off exchanges 📉 A net reduction of -2.09% of $BTC‘s entire supply moving… pic.twitter.com/Y0JTC880Np — Santiment (@santimentfeed) December 8, 2025 Institutions Step In Based on reports from BitcoinTresuries.Net and others, exchange outflows are not only going to private cold wallets. ETFs and public firms are also accumulating. BitBo lists ETFs holding over 1.5 million BTC and public companies holding over 1 million. Combined, those holdings represent nearly 11% of the total Bitcoin supply. According to analysts, institutional vehicles have quietly absorbed a lot of coins, changing where Bitcoin sits and who can sell it. Supply Moves Matter This is more than bookkeeping. Coins locked in institutional or self-custodied vaults are not sold on a whim. That makes available supply tighter. At the same time, coins leaving exchanges can lead to sharper price moves when demand surges because the pool of sellable coins is smaller. Some of the effects are already visible on price charts; others may show up later if buying pressure picks up. Price Action And Macro Focus Bitcoin traded near $90,650 with a small rise of 0.28% in recent action. Year-to-date gains stand at 11%. The market swung from a daily low of $89,540 to a high of $92,290, showing active trading around current levels. Traders are watching a Federal Reserve meeting closely, and the outcome is expected to drive short-term volatility. Interest-rate cues often move broader markets, and crypto is no exception.

Still, that same scarcity can make prices more sensitive to changes in demand, which raises the possibility of sharper swings.

The report shows that Ethereum’s weekly inflows came in far behind other major assets, even as overall sentiment in the crypto market improved. Meanwhile, XRP surged to the second-highest inflow position behind Bitcoin, and large investors are reallocating capital away from Ethereum and into funds linked to XRP. Ethereum Inflows Lose Momentum Ethereum’s position in institutional portfolios has weakened noticeably in recent weeks. This was evident in a four-week stretch of outflows throughout November. Notably, a recent broader market recovery pushed total digital asset inflows to $716 million last week, bringing the inflow stretch to two consecutive weeks. However, Ethereum captured only a small share of that capital. The report shows Ethereum with just $39.1 million in weekly inflows, a subdued figure compared to the sizeable movements seen in other assets. This soft performance follows months of cooling demand, and it suggests that institutional conviction in Ethereum is fading. Even the month-to-date figure trails behind expectations, coming in at $41.2 million, far below the institutional numbers of Bitcoin XRP, and even Chainlink. XRP Pulls In Massive Institutional Demand XRP ranked as the second-largest inflow recipient last week, drawing $245 million, more than six times what Ethereum received. This surge builds on strong year-to-date activity, lifting XRP’s total inflows for 2025 to over $3.1 billion, far above the $608 million recorded in 2024. CoinShares’ report shows that XRP’s inflows are a sustained trend rather than a one-off spike. Inflows into XRP-linked products have jumped massively since the introduction of Spot XRP ETFs in the US. Interestingly, these ETFs have witnessed consistent days of inflows since their launch. These figures indicate that institutions view XRP as a more attractive allocation than Ethereum at this stage of the market cycle. XRP’s strong accumulation coincides with improving sentiment across the derivatives market, where products linked to Bitcoin have also recovered. Speaking of Bitcoin, the leading cryptocurrency remained the dominant inflow magnet, with $352 million entering its investment products last week. However, the more notable story lies in the sequence of inflows just behind Bitcoin. Bitcoin continues to anchor portfolios, but capital that would have traditionally flowed into Ethereum is now finding its way into XRP, alongside other new institutional favorites such as Chainlink , which posted a record weekly inflow of $52.8 million, representing more than half of its year-to-date inflows. Across the geographic breakdown, inflows from the US, Germany, and Canada contributed heavily to this realignment. The US received the most inflows of $483 million last week. Germany, Canada, and Switzerland-based funds came in behind with $96.9 million, $80.7 million, and $34.4 million, respectively.",Ethereum|XRP|ETH|ETH news|ETH Price|ethereum news|ethereum price|ethusd|ETHUSDT|ripple|ripple news|XRP news|XRP price|XRPUSD|XRPUSDT,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|ETH|XRP|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-12-09 20:00:51

Trading desks, hedge funds, and institutional investors are quietly positioning themselves. One upcoming event is poised to reshape XRP’s market dynamics entirely. According to Amonyx, CME Group will launch spot‑quoted XRP futures next week. This development is expected to significantly impact liquidity, pricing, and institutional participation. Institutional Adoption Accelerates CME first introduced standard XRP futures earlier this year . These cash‑settled contracts quickly attracted substantial volume, reflecting growing interest from professional traders. By August, XRP futures reached $1 billion in open interest faster than any other CME contract. This milestone marked a shift from speculative trading to institutional-grade adoption. The introduction of spot‑quoted futures further signals that XRP is gaining recognition as a legitimate, investable asset . These contracts allow firms to hedge and manage exposure with precision. BREAKING Next week, CME launches $XRP Spot Futures… Nobody is ready for what comes next. pic.twitter.com/KsVrNuQIrR — Amonyx (@amonbuy) December 9, 2025 What Spot‑Quoted Futures Mean Spot‑quoted futures settle against real-time market prices instead of a reference rate. This reduces capital costs and allows large positions without market disruption. Institutions gain more predictable exposure, enhancing risk management. Lower margin requirements and real-time settlement make these contracts more efficient. This could encourage both traditional finance players and crypto-native funds to increase their XRP allocations. Broader Market Implications The launch of spot‑quoted XRP futures comes alongside options and standard futures. This layered derivatives ecosystem provides full trading and hedging tools for institutions. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 In addition, crypto ETFs and regulated investment products are gaining traction. Combining spot futures with ETFs and options could attract significant new capital inflows into XRP markets. The Road Ahead If trading volumes respond as expected, XRP could transform from a niche cryptocurrency into a mainstream financial instrument. Market liquidity, transparency, and institutional adoption will likely strengthen. Retail traders may benefit from tighter spreads and improved price stability. For institutions, the new contracts offer scalable, capital-efficient ways to trade or hedge XRP positions. As Amonyx notes, “nobody is ready for what comes next for XRP.” Yet the coordinated moves of major players suggest that a new phase in XRP markets is imminent . This moment could redefine both perception and participation in the broader cryptocurrency ecosystem. Disclaimer : This content is meant to inform and should not be considered financial advice.

Rivian, the electric vehicle innovator, has been secretly building its own AI assistant for nearly two years—a move that could redefine how we interact with our vehicles. This isn’t just another chatbot; it’s a sophisticated system designed to control every aspect of the vehicle, creating what might become the most intelligent EV assistant on the market. Why Rivian’s AI Assistant Matters for Electric Vehicles Rivian’s approach to artificial intelligence represents a strategic shift in the EV landscape. Unlike many competitors who rely on third-party solutions, Rivian has invested significant resources into developing proprietary technology. According to Wassym Bensaid, Rivian’s software chief, this isn’t a trend-chasing effort but a carefully planned integration that touches every vehicle control system. The company has built what Bensaid calls an “agentic framework”—an architecture that can interface with different AI models while maintaining seamless vehicle integration. The Architecture Behind Rivian’s Autonomous Driving Vision Rivian’s AI assistant operates on a hybrid software stack that combines edge and cloud computing. This dual approach allows for: Local processing of immediate tasks through edge AI Complex computations handled by cloud-based models Custom orchestration layers developed in-house Integration with vehicle safety and ADAS systems The company has developed much of this technology internally, including custom models and the crucial “orchestration layer” that ensures various AI components work together harmoniously. This vertical integration strategy mirrors Rivian’s broader approach to vehicle development, where control over the entire stack provides competitive advantages. Separate Paths: The Volkswagen Joint Venture and AI Development Interestingly, Rivian’s AI assistant development remains separate from its multi-billion dollar technology joint venture with Volkswagen. While the Volkswagen partnership focuses on underlying electrical architecture and infotainment systems worth up to $5.8 billion, the AI assistant represents Rivian’s independent innovation path. This separation allows Rivian to maintain control over what could become a key differentiator in the competitive EV market. Rivian AI Development vs. Volkswagen Partnership Rivian AI Assistant Volkswagen Joint Venture Independent development Shared technology development Focus on AI and autonomy Focus on electrical architecture Proprietary technology Shared IP for Volkswagen Group Immediate Rivian application Targeting 2027 implementation What to Expect from Rivian’s December 11 AI Reveal Rivian will showcase its AI assistant during the upcoming AI and Autonomy day on December 11. The live-streamed event promises to reveal: The specific capabilities of the AI assistant Integration details with vehicle controls Timeline for consumer availability How it differs from existing automotive AI solutions Bensaid has indicated that the company targeted end-of-year deployment, suggesting we might see this technology in Rivian vehicles sooner than expected. The Competitive Edge of Agentic Framework in EVs Rivian’s agentic framework represents a sophisticated approach to automotive AI. Unlike simple voice assistants, this system coordinates various workflows and resolves conflicts between different vehicle systems. The framework is model-agnostic, allowing Rivian to integrate the best available AI technologies while maintaining control over the user experience. This flexibility could prove crucial as AI technology continues to evolve rapidly. FAQs About Rivian’s AI Assistant Development Who is leading Rivian’s AI assistant development? Wassym Bensaid, Rivian’s software chief, is overseeing the AI assistant development. The team operates from Rivian’s Palo Alto office. How does this relate to Rivian’s partnership with Volkswagen? The AI assistant development is separate from the Volkswagen joint venture, which focuses on electrical architecture and software platforms rather than AI assistants or autonomous driving. What companies are involved in foundational AI that might influence Rivian? While Rivian develops its own technology, the broader AI landscape includes companies like OpenAI , Anthropic , Google , Microsoft , and Meta that build core models and infrastructure. When will consumers get access to Rivian’s AI assistant? While no specific date has been announced, Bensaid indicated a target of end-of-year deployment during earlier interviews. What makes Rivian’s approach different from other automotive AI? Rivian has built a model-agnostic, agentic framework that integrates with all vehicle controls rather than being a simple infotainment add-on. The Future of Intelligent Electric Vehicles Rivian’s AI assistant development signals a new era for electric vehicles—one where intelligence becomes as important as range and performance. By building proprietary AI technology that integrates deeply with vehicle systems, Rivian positions itself at the forefront of the intelligent EV revolution. This approach could create stronger customer engagement and trust while providing a platform for future autonomous capabilities. The December 11 reveal will be a crucial moment, not just for Rivian but for the entire EV industry.

This isn’t science fiction—it’s the startling reality revealed by new Pew Research data. As cryptocurrency enthusiasts understand the power of emerging technologies, the rapid adoption of AI chatbots among youth presents both revolutionary potential and disturbing risks that demand our immediate attention. AI Chatbots: The New Digital Playground for American Teens The Pew Research Center’s comprehensive study reveals that AI chatbots have become an integral part of teenage life in the United States. About 30% of U.S. teens now use these tools daily, with 4% reporting they use them “almost constantly.” This represents a seismic shift in how young people interact with technology, creating a new layer of digital engagement beyond traditional social media platforms. When examining specific platforms, the dominance is clear: ChatGPT leads with 59% of teens using it Google’s Gemini follows at 23% Meta AI captures 20% of teen users 46% of teens use AI chatbots several times weekly 36% don’t use them at all ChatGPT Dominance and Racial Disparities in Usage The Pew Research data reveals striking patterns in how different demographic groups engage with AI chatbots. Racial and ethnic differences are particularly pronounced, mirroring broader trends in technology adoption among American youth. Key findings include: Demographic Chatbot Usage “Almost Constantly Online” Black Teens 68% 55% Hispanic Teens 68% 52% White Teens 58% 27% “The racial and ethnic differences in teen chatbot use were striking,” Pew Research Associate Michelle Faverio noted. “This pattern is consistent with other racial and ethnic differences we’ve seen in teen technology use.” Teen Mental Health: The Dark Side of AI Interactions While many teens use AI chatbots for homework help and casual questions, the relationship can turn dangerous. The families of at least two teenagers have sued OpenAI, alleging ChatGPT provided their children with detailed instructions on how to commit suicide. These tragic cases highlight the potential for AI interactions to become harmful, especially for vulnerable youth. Character.AI, another popular platform, has faced similar scrutiny. After reports of teenagers dying by suicide following prolonged conversations with AI chatbots, the company stopped offering its services to minors and launched a safer alternative called “Stories.” Dr. Nina Vasan, a psychiatrist and director of Brainstorm: The Stanford Lab for Mental Health Innovation, emphasizes the responsibility of AI companies: “Even if their tools weren’t designed for emotional support, people are using them in that way, and that means companies do have a responsibility to adjust their models to be solving for user well-being.” Social Media Context: The Broader Digital Landscape AI chatbots exist within a broader ecosystem of teen internet use. The Pew Research study shows that 97% of teens use the internet daily, with about 40% saying they’re “almost constantly online.” While this represents a decrease from last year’s 46%, it’s significantly higher than the 24% reported a decade ago. This constant connectivity occurs against a backdrop of global concern about social media’s impact on teen mental health. Australia plans to enforce a social media ban for under-16s, while the U.S. surgeon general has called for warning labels on social media platforms. Age and Income Factors in AI Adoption The Pew Research data reveals how age and household income influence AI chatbot usage among teens: Older teens (15-17) use both social media and AI chatbots more frequently than younger teens (13-14) 62% of teens in households earning over $75,000 use ChatGPT 52% of teens below that income threshold use ChatGPT Character.AI usage is twice as popular (14%) in homes with incomes below $75,000 The Scale of the Problem: When Small Percentages Mean Millions OpenAI’s own data reveals the scale of potential harm. While only 0.15% of ChatGPT’s active users discuss suicide weekly, on a platform with 800 million weekly users, this represents over one million people having these conversations with AI each week. This statistic underscores how even small percentages can translate to massive numbers of vulnerable individuals. FAQs: Understanding the AI Chatbot Phenomenon What percentage of U.S. teens use AI chatbots daily? About 30% of U.S. teens use AI chatbots every day, according to Pew Research data. Which AI chatbot is most popular among teenagers? ChatGPT dominates with 59% of teens using it, more than twice as popular as the next competitors. What are the main safety concerns with teen AI chatbot use? Primary concerns include potential addiction, harmful content generation (including suicide instructions), and the emotional impact of prolonged AI conversations on developing minds. How does teen AI usage vary by race? Black and Hispanic teens (68% each) are more likely to use AI chatbots than white teens (58%), according to Pew Research findings. What actions have AI companies taken regarding teen safety? Character.AI stopped offering chatbots to minors, while OpenAI faces lawsuits alleging inadequate safety measures. Who is Dr. Nina Vasan? Dr. Nina Vasan is a psychiatrist and director of Brainstorm: The Stanford Lab for Mental Health Innovation , who has commented on AI companies’ responsibility for user well-being. Conclusion: Navigating the AI Frontier with Caution and Responsibility The Pew Research findings paint a complex picture of AI chatbot adoption among American teens. While these tools offer educational benefits and represent technological progress, they also introduce significant risks to teen mental health. The racial disparities in usage patterns suggest deeper digital divides that warrant further investigation. As AI continues to evolve, balancing innovation with safety measures becomes increasingly critical. Parents, educators, and policymakers must work together with technology companies to create safer digital environments for young users.

55566963,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=240743,1765312810,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,"Bitcoin Price Plummets: Key Reasons BTC Fell Below $93,000",https://bitcoinworld.co.in/bitcoin-price-falls-below-93000-3/,"BitcoinWorld Bitcoin Price Plummets: Key Reasons BTC Fell Below $93,000 The cryptocurrency market experienced a sudden jolt as the Bitcoin price tumbled below the critical $93,000 support level. According to real-time data from Binance’s USDT trading pair, BTC is currently trading at $92,979.67. This move has sent ripples through the investor community, prompting urgent questions about the market’s immediate direction. What triggered this decline, and is it a temporary dip or the start of a deeper correction? Let’s analyze the factors at play. What Caused the Sudden Bitcoin Price Drop? Market corrections are a normal part of any financial asset’s lifecycle, and Bitcoin is no exception. The recent dip below $93,000 can be attributed to a confluence of factors. Firstly, profit-taking is a likely contributor. After a significant rally, some investors inevitably cash out to secure gains, creating selling pressure. Secondly, broader macroeconomic sentiment often influences crypto. Concerns about interest rates or geopolitical tensions can lead investors to move capital into perceived safer assets. Finally, technical trading levels play a role. The $93,000 mark may have acted as a key psychological support; breaking through it can trigger automated sell orders, accelerating the decline. Understanding Bitcoin Price Volatility For newcomers, the Bitcoin price swings can seem alarming. However, volatility is inherent to the asset class. Unlike traditional stocks, the crypto market operates 24/7 and has a relatively lower market capitalization, making it more susceptible to large moves based on news or sentiment. Therefore, it’s crucial to view price action within a broader context. Is the long-term adoption trend still intact? Are the fundamental reasons for holding Bitcoin still valid? Often, the answer is yes, which means short-term price movements, while nerve-wracking, may not alter the long-term thesis. When analyzing the Bitcoin price , consider these key aspects: Market Sentiment: Fear and greed indicators can show if the market is overbought or oversold. On-Chain Data: Metrics like exchange inflows/outflows can signal whether holders are moving coins to sell or to cold storage. Global Liquidity: The overall availability of capital in financial markets impacts risk assets like Bitcoin. What Should Investors Do Now? Seeing the Bitcoin price fall can trigger emotional decisions. The most important action is to avoid panic selling. History has shown that reacting to short-term dips often leads to missing subsequent recoveries. Instead, this could be a moment for strategic review. For long-term holders, a strategy known as “dollar-cost averaging”—investing a fixed amount regularly regardless of price—can help navigate volatility. For active traders, identifying new support and resistance levels becomes paramount. Always remember, investing should align with your personal risk tolerance and financial goals. The Long-Term Outlook for Bitcoin Beyond the daily Bitcoin price quote, the fundamental narrative remains strong. Institutional adoption continues, with more firms offering Bitcoin-related products. The upcoming Bitcoin halving event, which reduces the rate of new supply, is historically a bullish catalyst. Moreover, Bitcoin’s core value proposition as a decentralized store of value and hedge against inflation continues to attract believers worldwide. While price corrections are inevitable, they often create healthier market conditions and opportunities for new investors to enter. In summary, the drop below $93,000 is a significant market event that demands attention but not alarm. It underscores the volatile nature of cryptocurrency investing. By focusing on fundamentals, employing sound risk management, and maintaining a long-term perspective, investors can navigate these turbulent waters. The journey of Bitcoin is rarely a straight line upward, but its trajectory over the past decade demonstrates remarkable resilience and growth. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q: Is Bitcoin going to crash further after falling below $93,000? A: No one can predict short-term price movements with certainty. While a further drop is possible, it could also be a temporary correction. It’s essential to look at support levels and broader market indicators rather than reacting to a single data point. Q: Should I buy more Bitcoin now that the price is lower? A: This depends entirely on your investment strategy and risk profile. Some investors see dips as buying opportunities, while others wait for more stability. Never invest more than you can afford to lose. Q: What is the main reason for this price drop? A: It’s typically a combination of factors including profit-taking by short-term traders, negative broader market sentiment, and the breaking of key technical support levels which triggers automated selling. Q: How does this affect other cryptocurrencies? A> Bitcoin often sets the tone for the entire crypto market. A significant drop in BTC price usually leads to declines across most major altcoins, a phenomenon known as “market correlation.” Q: Where can I reliably track the Bitcoin price? A> Reputable cryptocurrency data aggregators and major exchanges like Binance, Coinbase, and Kraken provide real-time price information. Always cross-reference data from multiple sources.

The December 9 letter marks a significant shift in regulatory stance toward digital asset integration within the conventional banking sector. The directive enables financial institutions to act as intermediaries in cryptocurrency trades without holding the assets on their balance sheets. Banks can now facilitate matched transactions between customers and counterparties, eliminating direct exposure to crypto volatility while expanding service offerings. Regulatory Reversal Signals Industry Maturation The OCC's latest position represents a departure from its cautious approach between 2021 and 2024. During that period, the agency implemented strict oversight measures and collaborated with the Federal Reserve to highlight cryptocurrency risks, including liquidity concerns and price volatility. The new framework allows banks that previously operated crypto pilots to pursue comprehensive digital asset programs. Currently, few institutions hold OCC charters specifically for crypto operations. Anchorage Digital remains one of the rare examples of a chartered crypto bank. The updated guidance could accelerate the emergence of hybrid banking models combining traditional and digital asset services. The OCC letter emphasizes customer benefits as a primary justification for the policy change. Regulated banks can now offer crypto transaction services that provide greater oversight and consumer protection compared to unregulated platforms. Customers gain access to digital asset markets through institutions subject to federal supervision and compliance requirements. By positioning banks as intermediaries, the framework addresses counterparty risk concerns. Customers can avoid direct engagement with pseudonymous traders or unregulated exchanges. Banks provide operational infrastructure and risk management capabilities that individual investors may lack. The OCC stipulates that all riskless principal crypto transactions must adhere to safety and soundness standards. Banks remain subject to applicable laws and regulatory oversight.

The powerful American Federation of Teachers (AFT) is taking a firm stand against proposed legislation that would pave the way for crypto in retirement funds . Their opposition highlights a deep divide between crypto innovation and financial security for millions of workers. Why Are Teachers Fighting Crypto in 401(k) Plans? The AFT, representing 1.7 million educators, strongly opposes the Responsible Financial Innovation Act (RFIA). Their core argument is simple: treating volatile cryptocurrencies as stable retirement assets is a dangerous gamble. The union believes this move is premature, pointing to the market’s history of fraud and extreme price swings as clear red flags for pension security. The Hidden Risk in the Crypto Retirement Bill Beyond volatility, the union identifies a more technical but critical threat. The bill could allow non-crypto companies to ‘tokenize’ their stock on a blockchain. This sounds complex, but the concern is straightforward: it might create loopholes that let these new digital securities bypass traditional investor protections. If that happens, these assets could slip into the pension and 401(k) plans that teachers and others rely on for their future. The AFT’s position is clear: advancing this bill weakens the very regulations designed to protect people’s life savings. They argue the current framework for crypto in retirement funds is insufficient, citing: Ongoing market fraud and illicit activities. A lack of clear, consistent regulatory oversight. The fundamental mismatch between high-risk crypto and the goal of stable retirement growth. What Does the Crypto Bill Actually Propose? On the other side, supporters of the RFIA see it as a necessary step for modern finance. The bill aims to: Clarify which government agencies regulate different digital assets. Allow more banks and traditional financial institutions to participate in crypto markets. Explicitly permit cryptocurrency investments within retirement accounts like 401(k)s. Proponents argue this creates a clearer path for responsible innovation. However, for the teachers’ union, the potential for crypto in retirement funds represents a fundamental threat to the security promised by pensions. They see it as treating speculative investments with the same seriousness as established, regulated financial instruments—a view they call ‘disconnected from reality.’ The Bottom Line: Security vs. Innovation This clash isn’t just about one bill; it’s about a philosophical divide. It pits the drive for financial innovation against the principle of fiduciary duty—the legal obligation to act in the best financial interest of another party. For teachers, the priority is the unwavering security of the retirement nest eggs they’ve spent decades building. The debate over crypto in retirement funds forces us to ask a crucial question: Should retirement accounts be a testing ground for emerging, high-risk asset classes? The AFT’s forceful opposition sends a powerful message. It underscores that for many Americans, especially those in public service, retirement planning is about certainty, not speculation. As this debate moves forward, the concerns of one of the nation’s largest unions will undoubtedly shape the conversation about what belongs in a retirement portfolio and what should stay out. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) What is the Responsible Financial Innovation Act (RFIA)? The RFIA is a proposed U.S. Senate bill that seeks to create a comprehensive regulatory framework for digital assets like cryptocurrency. A key provision would allow these assets to be included in retirement investment plans. Why does the teachers’ union oppose crypto in retirement funds? The American Federation of Teachers opposes it due to the high volatility and fraud risks in the crypto market. They believe including such speculative assets could jeopardize the financial security of retirees and weaken existing investor protection laws. Can I currently put cryptocurrency in my 401(k)? Currently, it is very rare and generally not offered by major plan providers due to regulatory uncertainty and fiduciary concerns. Some specialized, self-directed IRAs may allow it, but they come with significant risks and complexities. What does ‘tokenizing stock’ mean, and why is it a concern? Tokenizing stock means creating a digital version of a company’s shares on a blockchain. The union fears this new form of security might not be subject to the same strict disclosure and reporting rules as traditional stock, creating a regulatory loophole. What is the main argument FOR allowing crypto in retirement plans? Proponents argue it provides more choice and potential for growth for investors, modernizes the financial system, and brings clarity to a currently murky regulatory environment for digital assets. What happens next with this bill? The bill is before the Senate Banking Committee. Strong opposition from groups like the AFT means it will likely face significant debate and potential amendments before it could ever come to a vote, making its future uncertain. Did this breakdown of the crypto retirement fund debate help you understand the stakes? This issue affects the future savings of millions.

GeeFi is making a name for itself, having impressively sold 10 million tokens and raised $500,000 in its first phase alone. This momentum has continued, with total sales now reaching 22.5M tokens and cumulative funds raised exceeding $1 million from a dedicated community of over 2,100 investors . As a comprehensive non-custodial ecosystem, GeeFi is capturing significant market interest, with analysts forecasting that Phase 3 will sell out in under 10 days amid growing rumors of major exchange listings. Moving Past Hype-Driven Tokens Dogecoin’s value is largely tied to social media trends and celebrity endorsements, making it a highly speculative and unpredictable asset for serious investors. This has led many to seek out utility-focused projects like GeeFi , which experts are increasingly identifying as 2026’s 100x gem . GeeFi provides a single, unified platform where users can manage assets across more than 14 networks , facilitating effortless token swaps and chain bridging. This practical, all-in-one solution addresses the fragmentation and complexity common in today’s crypto market. The GeeFi Team began development in 2023 and publicly launched the project in 2024 with a strict focus on delivering a functional product over generating hype. This strategy is evident in the platform’s security-first design, which ensures users always maintain full control over their private keys. With the Android app already live and an iOS version in development, GeeFi is delivering tangible progress. This commitment to real-world utility is a key reason many believe it will be 2026’s 100x gem . The GeeFi Presale Opportunity GeeFi is currently in Phase 2 of its presale, with tokens priced at an attractive $0.06 . This entry point offers a guaranteed return of 667% based on the confirmed $0.40 listing price . The potential for substantial gains is even greater; an investment of $1,800 today could grow to $90,000 if the token reaches the analysts’ projected $3 valuation , delivering an incredible 4,900% ROI . The presale’s momentum has been widely praised by market observers. The success of Phase 1 has carried into Phase 2, which is now more than 80% complete . In this phase alone, GeeFi has raised over $750K from the sale of 12.5M tokens . Experts anticipate that Phase 3 will launch next week and sell out rapidly, driven by intensifying speculation about listings on top-tier exchanges, solidifying its status as 2026’s 100x gem . Lucrative Staking and Referral Rewards A major factor driving demand for GeeFi is its highly competitive staking program. Investors can generate significant passive income through several flexible term options. By locking tokens, users can earn 15% APR for one month , 22% APR for three months , or an impressive 55% APR for a 12-month term . For those who value liquidity, GeeFi also offers a staking option with no locked funds that still provides returns of up to 10% . To further amplify earnings, the project features a rewarding referral program. By sharing a unique link, users earn a 5% bonus in GEE tokens on every purchase made by their referrals. This system incentivizes community growth and allows early supporters to significantly multiply their holdings. These features offer real, sustainable yield, attracting investors focused on maximizing portfolio efficiency. Seize the Opportunity Before It’s Gone The chance to invest in a project with such strong fundamentals and massive growth potential is rare. GeeFi’s presale is a limited-time opportunity to secure a position before it becomes widely known. With a deflationary token model, a live product, and a clear roadmap that includes a crypto card, GeeFi is positioned to become a dominant force in the industry.

Related Reading: Shiba Inu Whales Spike To 6-Month High: What’s Brewing? The move positions the company at the center of the UAE’s growing digital-asset ecosystem, strengthening its ability to scale stablecoin adoption across the region. For a market actively developing clearer regulatory frameworks and attracting global crypto players, Circle’s entry underscores the central role stablecoins have come to play in payment infrastructure and cross-border finance. ETH's price trends to the downside on the daily chart. Source: ETHUSD on Tradingview Circle Secures ADGM Approval and Expands Regional Strategy The license, granted by ADGM’s Financial Services Regulatory Authority, permits Circle to operate as a regulated Money Services Provider within the financial free zone. This follows preliminary approval earlier this year and gives the firm formal permission to offer USDC-powered payment, settlement and on-chain financial tools to businesses and institutions across the UAE. Alongside the approval, Circle appointed Dr. Saeeda Jaffar as managing director for the Middle East and Africa. A long-time payments executive with leadership experience at Visa and major consulting firms, she will guide Circle’s expansion efforts, deepen local partnerships, and help integrate USDC into regional prospects. Her appointment reflects Circle’s intent to localize operations and strengthen ties with banks, enterprises, and government entities. UAE Supports Push Toward Regulated Digital Finance Circle’s regulatory milestone comes as the UAE increases its efforts to build an institutional-grade digital asset ecosystem. ADGM and Dubai’s DIFC have both issued stablecoin and token frameworks designed to offer clarity for companies operating in the sector. USDC and EURC were recognized earlier this year under Dubai’s crypto token regime, providing Circle with visibility across both major financial zones in the country. The approval also coincides with a wave of regulatory progress for other major players. Binance received full authorization to operate its global platform under ADGM oversight this week, while Tether secured recognition for USDT across multiple blockchain networks. These developments show how Abu Dhabi is positioning itself as a global hub for regulated stablecoin activity, driven by remittance demand, trade flows, and a growing emphasis on compliance. Stablecoin Adoption Enters New Phase The UAE’s structured approach comes at a time when stablecoins are gaining broader acceptance in global finance. With regulatory guardrails expanding internationally and stablecoins increasingly used for cross-border payments, Circle’s license opens the door for wider USDC adoption in corporate finance, developer applications, and digital-asset settlement.

A recent report shows that Ethereum is transitioning from blockchain to the big league, as the network overtakes dollar-denominated transactions across digital payments. A Leader In Dollar Transactions With a surge in stablecoin transfer volume, Ethereum is no longer only a rival in the cryptocurrency space. In a post on the X platform, Leon Waidmann, a market expert and head of research at On-Chain Foundation, reported that ETH is currently surpassing some of the largest traditional payment networks in the world in terms of raw transaction volume. Data from the post reveals a surge in dollar-denominated transactions on Ethereum , which has triggered new conversations about its increasing prominence as a layer of global settlement. This spike shows that the blockchain’s changing role in finance is becoming more difficult for institutions to ignore as volumes surge past expectations. With one month remaining in the year, the amount of ETH stablecoin transfers in Q4 has already exceeded that of Q3. According to the data, the leading network has recorded nearly $6 trillion in stablecoin volume in the fourth quarter of this year alone, reflecting its growing demand for payment settlement. When it comes to dollar-dominated transaction volume, the blockchain has already outpaced both Visa and Mastercard transaction volumes in the current quarter. Given the surge in stablecoin transfer volume, Ethereum is gradually becoming the major settlement layer for digital dollars. Waidmann stated that the size makes early Decentralized Finance (DeFi) activity appear insignificant by comparison. In the meantime, the conventional financial infrastructure is being surpassed by the on-chain economy. Ethereum Network’s Throughput Exhibiting Robust Growth As demand for Ethereum as the main settlement layer grows, the network is also quietly entering a new phase of its evolution. This change is one that is characterized by accessibility, efficiency, and quickness rather than traffic jams and soaring costs. Waidmann highlighted that ETH scaling is rising, alongside growing throughput and declining transaction costs. With transaction prices continuously declining and network throughput surging, the blockchain is demonstrating concrete evidence that its long-promised scaling vision is coming to pass. As a result, Ethereum will be able to handle an increasing amount of activity over time . However, the network’s usage cost continues to decline, drawing close to zero. Currently, Layer 2s take care of the heavy execution while the mainnet settles the valuable transactions. Should these two lines continue to move in opposite directions, ETH is scaling just as planned. At the time of writing, the price of ETH was still holding above the $3,100 level despite recording a more than 1% decline in the last 24 hours. Its trading volume has also witnessed a bearish action, dropping by over 4% in the past day.",Ethereum|decentralized finance|DeFi|ETH|ETH news|ETH Price|Ethereum network|ethereum news|ethereum price|Ethereum scaling|ethusd|ETHUSDT|layer-2s|Leon Waidmann|On-chain Foundation,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|ETH|FIAT|TRADING|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-12-09 21:00:53

This single transaction, worth a quarter of a billion dollars, is more than just a large number on a screen. It’s a powerful signal of demand and liquidity flowing into the ecosystem. But what does it actually mean when such a vast amount of stablecoin is created out of thin air? Let’s dive into the implications of this whale-sized event. What Does It Mean When USDC Is Minted? First, let’s simplify the process. When we say USDC is minted , it means new USDC tokens are created and released into circulation. Circle, the company behind USDC, does this when a user deposits an equivalent amount of US dollars. For every 1 USDC token that appears on the blockchain, there should be 1 US dollar held in reserve. Therefore, a mint of this scale strongly suggests that a major institution or a group of investors has just converted $250 million in cash into crypto-ready digital dollars. Why Would Anyone Mint 250 Million USDC? Such an enormous mint doesn’t happen without a significant reason. It typically points to substantial planned activity within the cryptocurrency markets. Here are the most likely explanations: Institutional Entry: A large traditional finance player, like a hedge fund or trading firm, may be preparing to make a major move into crypto assets like Bitcoin or Ethereum. USDC provides the perfect on-ramp. DeFi Liquidity Injection: The funds could be destined for Decentralized Finance (DeFi) protocols to earn yield through lending, liquidity provisioning, or other strategies. Exchange Preparation: Major exchanges often mint large batches of stablecoins to ensure sufficient liquidity for expected high trading volumes or to facilitate large over-the-counter (OTC) trades for clients. Corporate Treasury Strategy: More companies are adding crypto to their balance sheets. This mint could represent a strategic allocation into stablecoins for treasury management. The Ripple Effect: How a Large USDC Mint Impacts the Market The immediate effect of seeing 250 million USDC minted is a psychological boost. It signals strong confidence and capital inflow. However, the real impact depends on what happens next. If this USDC is quickly deployed into buying major cryptocurrencies, it can create upward price pressure. Conversely, if it sits idle or is used primarily in DeFi, it boosts the overall liquidity and health of the crypto financial system without directly moving spot prices. This liquidity acts as the lifeblood for trading, lending, and borrowing across the ecosystem. Should Retail Investors Care About USDC Minting Events? Absolutely. While you may not be moving nine-figure sums, these whale alerts serve as valuable market intelligence. A large mint can be a leading indicator of where smart money is flowing. It doesn’t mean you should blindly follow, but it’s a data point worth noting. It often precedes periods of increased volatility or activity, especially in the DeFi sector where stablecoin yields can shift based on available liquidity. Therefore, keeping an eye on these events helps you understand the underlying currents of market sentiment and capital movement. Conclusion: A Sign of a Maturing Market The event of 250 million USDC being minted is a testament to the growing scale and institutionalization of the cryptocurrency space. Transactions of this magnitude were rare just a few years ago. Today, they highlight how stablecoins like USDC have become critical infrastructure, facilitating the seamless movement of vast sums in the digital economy. This mint is not an anomaly; it’s a sign of a healthy, liquid, and expanding market where traditional finance and decentralized innovation continue to converge. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q: Who exactly minted the 250 million USDC? A: The mint was executed by the official USDC Treasury, which is controlled by Circle. The entity that deposited the $250 million to trigger the mint is not publicly disclosed on-chain, but it is likely a large institutional client. Q: Does minting new USDC cause inflation? A: No, not in the traditional sense. USDC is a fully-backed stablecoin. Each new token is minted only when an equivalent US dollar is deposited and held in reserve. It represents a conversion of existing dollars into a digital form, not the printing of new money. Q: How can I track large transactions like this myself? A: You can follow blockchain analytics bots like Whale Alert on social media platforms like Twitter (X). These accounts automatically post notable transactions involving major cryptocurrencies and stablecoins. Q: Is a large USDC mint always bullish for crypto prices? A> Not necessarily. While it indicates capital entering the crypto ecosystem, it is only bullish if that capital is used to purchase other crypto assets like Bitcoin. If the USDC is used for DeFi yield farming or sits in a wallet, its direct impact on market prices may be minimal. Q: What’s the difference between minting and burning USDC? A: Minting creates new tokens (adding supply) when dollars are deposited. Burning destroys tokens (reducing supply) when users redeem USDC for US dollars. The two processes maintain the 1:1 peg.

This colossal USDT whale transfer is more than just a number on a screen; it’s a seismic event that sends powerful ripples through the market, prompting urgent questions about its origin, intent, and potential impact on prices and liquidity. What Does This Massive USDT Whale Transfer Actually Mean? First, let’s break down the basics. A ‘ USDT whale transfer ‘ of this magnitude typically signals significant capital movement. When such a vast sum of the primary stablecoin moves onto a centralized exchange like OKX, it often precedes one of two major actions. The holder could be preparing to swap this stablecoin for other cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin or Ethereum, which might indicate an upcoming large buy order. Alternatively, they might be moving funds for safekeeping or to provide liquidity. The ‘unknown wallet’ aspect adds a layer of mystery, highlighting how major players can operate with significant anonymity on the blockchain. Why Should Everyday Crypto Investors Care? You might wonder why a single transaction between two wallets matters to you. The truth is, whale movements are a critical leading indicator for market sentiment. Think of this USDT whale transfer as a radar blip showing a large ship changing course. It doesn’t guarantee a storm, but it demands attention. Here’s what it can signal: Buying Pressure: If the whale converts USDT to BTC or ETH, the massive buy order can drive prices up. Market Confidence: Moving funds to an exchange can signal an intent to engage with the market, sometimes interpreted as bullish. Liquidity Shifts: It redistributes vast liquidity, affecting trading pairs and stability on the exchange. However, it’s crucial to avoid panic. One transaction is a data point, not a definitive trend. Decoding the Challenges of Tracking Whale Activity While services like Whale Alert provide transparency, interpreting a USDT whale transfer comes with challenges. The wallet is ‘unknown,’ so we cannot identify the entity—be it an institution, fund, or individual. Furthermore, we cannot discern the ultimate purpose without seeing subsequent transactions. Is this capital being deployed, or simply repositioned? This ambiguity is why analysts watch for follow-up activity on the chain. The move also tests market infrastructure, as exchanges must manage such large inflows without disruption. Actionable Insights: How to Respond to Major Whale Alerts So, what can you do when you see an alert for a huge USDT whale transfer ? Don’t make impulsive trades. Instead, use it as a cue for deeper research. Monitor the OKX order books for large bids in major pairs. Check if other whales are making similar moves. Look at broader market conditions—is fear or greed dominating? This event should inform your strategy, not define it. Remember, informed decisions beat reactive ones every time. The Ripple Effect: Liquidity, Stability, and Future Moves This $205 million USDT whale transfer significantly boosts liquidity on OKX. For traders, this can mean tighter spreads and better execution for large orders. For Tether (USDT) itself, it reinforces its role as the dominant settlement layer for major capital movements in crypto. The key question now is: what’s next? The market will watch closely to see if this capital remains as USDT, converts to other assets, or even moves off-exchange again. Each path tells a different story about whale sentiment. Conclusion: A Signal in the Noise The transfer of 204.5 million USDT to OKX is a powerful reminder of the scale at which major players operate in cryptocurrency. While its immediate impact may not be a dramatic price swing, it is a significant liquidity event that underscores the importance of on-chain analytics. For savvy investors, understanding the context behind such USDT whale transfers is essential for navigating the market’s waves. Stay observant, stay rational, and let the data guide you. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What is a “whale” in cryptocurrency? A: A “whale” is an individual or entity that holds a large enough amount of a cryptocurrency to potentially influence its market price through their trades. Q2: Why do whales move USDT to exchanges like OKX? A: The primary reasons are to trade it for other assets (like Bitcoin), to provide liquidity, or to securely hold funds on a platform with advanced trading tools and security. Q3: Does a large USDT transfer to an exchange always mean the price will go up? A: No, not always. It indicates potential buying power, but the price impact only occurs if the whale executes large buy orders. The funds could also be moved for other purposes. Q4: How can I track whale movements myself? A: You can use blockchain explorers like Etherscan for Ethereum-based tokens (like USDT) or follow social media accounts and websites dedicated to on-chain analytics and alerts. Q5: What is an “unknown wallet”? A: It’s a cryptocurrency wallet address that is not publicly linked to a known identity, such as an exchange, company, or individual. The owner remains anonymous. Q6: Is a $205 million USDT transfer unusual? A: While large, transfers of this scale are not uncommon in the crypto market, especially among institutional players and large funds managing billions in assets.

Cursor AI, the coding assistant that’s become a darling of developers worldwide, has reached $1 billion in annualized revenue and secured a $29.3 billion valuation. But how does a company that relies on its competitors’ technology plan to outmaneuver them? CEO Michael Truell reveals the surprising strategy that’s keeping Cursor AI ahead in the race. Why Cursor AI Isn’t Worried About OpenAI Competition At Fortune’s AI Brainstorming conference, Michael Truell made a striking comparison that reveals his company’s confidence. He described competitors’ coding products as “a concept car” while positioning Cursor as “a production automobile.” This distinction goes to the heart of Cursor AI’s strategy: while they leverage the best intelligence from multiple providers, including OpenAI and Anthropic models, they’ve built something fundamentally different—an integrated, end-to-end solution specifically designed for real-world development workflows. Truell explained: “What we do is we take the best intelligence that the market has to offer from many different providers. And we also do our own product-specific models in places. We take that, we build it together and integrate it then also build the best tool and end UX for working with AI.” The Secret Weapon: Cursor’s Home-Grown LLMs While Cursor AI utilizes external models, the company confirmed in November that their in-house models “now generate more code than almost any other LLMs in the world.” These specialized models represent a critical competitive advantage. Unlike general-purpose models from OpenAI and Anthropic, Cursor’s models are fine-tuned specifically for coding tasks, understanding context, syntax, and development patterns that generic models might miss. This dual approach—leveraging external intelligence while developing specialized internal capabilities—has positioned Cursor uniquely in the market. The strategy became particularly relevant earlier this year when OpenAI reportedly considered acquiring Anysphere (Cursor’s parent company), an offer the startup turned down. Navigating the AI Coding Assistant Pricing Challenge One of the biggest challenges facing AI coding assistants has been profitability. Investors revealed to Bitcoin World that many were losing money due to high costs paid to model makers like OpenAI. Cursor AI addressed this head-on in July by shifting to a usage-based pricing model, directly passing API fees to users. The change caused initial uproar among some users, but Truell defended the move as necessary: “When we started Cursor, you would turn to Cursor for a quick JavaScript question and now you’re turning to it to do hours of work for you. So the pricing model had to shift for us and others in the space.” The company is now developing cloud-computing-like cost-management tools for enterprises, including: Spend controls and billing groups Real-time usage monitoring Visibility into engineer-generated costs Enterprise-grade administration features Michael Truell’s Vision: Beyond Code Generation Truell outlined two major focus areas for the coming year that demonstrate Cursor AI’s evolution from a coding tool to a comprehensive development platform: Complex Agentic Functions: “We want you to take end-to-end tasks, ones that are concise to specify but then are really hard to do, and have them entirely be done by Cursor. An example is a bug fix,” Truell explained. He specifically mentioned bugs that might take “weeks of someone’s time, thousands of times running the code”—exactly the kind of tedious, complex work where AI can provide transformative value. Team-Focused Development: Truell emphasized moving from serving individual coders to “thinking about teams as the atomic unit that we serve.” This shift signals Cursor’s growing enterprise business and their understanding that software development is inherently collaborative. How Cursor AI Plans to Beat the Giants While OpenAI, Anthropic, Amazon, and Microsoft are all developing their own coding tools and agentic systems, Cursor maintains several advantages: Advantage Description Competitive Impact Specialized Models Fine-tuned specifically for coding tasks Better performance on development-specific problems Integrated Workflow End-to-end development environment Seamless developer experience Enterprise Focus Team-level features and controls Better adoption in organizational settings Multi-Model Strategy Leverages best models from multiple providers Reduces dependency on any single AI company Cursor is already expanding beyond code generation with products like their code review tool, which analyzes every pull request—whether written by AI or human developers. “So you’ll see us start to help teams more as a whole,” Truell promised, indicating more team-focused features are coming. The Future of AI Development Tools The competitive landscape is heating up rapidly. Amazon recently released a coding tool promising to run for days, while major players including Anthropic, OpenAI, Microsoft, and AWS have launched a consortium under the Linux Foundation to develop open source agentic interoperability standards. They’ve even contributed key projects like Anthropic’s Model Context Protocol (MCP). Despite this intensifying competition, Truell remains confident. His plans for the year may not put Anysphere firmly ahead of the model-making giants, but they should keep the company “in the race”—and potentially position them as the preferred solution for developers who need more than just raw AI power. The Bottom Line: Cursor AI’s success demonstrates that in the AI revolution, specialization and integration can compete effectively against scale and resources. By focusing on solving specific developer problems with tailored solutions, building team-level capabilities, and maintaining flexibility in their AI model strategy, they’ve carved out a sustainable position in a market dominated by tech titans.

This exclusive revelation comes as the AI revolution reshapes global markets and investment strategies, creating unprecedented opportunities for forward-thinking investors. Why Did Kabir Narang Leave B Capital? Kabir Narang’s departure from B Capital marks the end of an eight-year tenure where he played a pivotal role in shaping the firm’s Asia strategy. As a founding general partner who joined in March 2017, Narang co-led the firm’s operations from Singapore and chaired its global investment committee. His exit represents a strategic shift in the venture capital sector, particularly as AI technologies accelerate market transformations. During his time at B Capital, Narang built an impressive portfolio of Indian startup investments including: Meesho – Social commerce platform Khatabook – Digital ledger application CredAvenue – Debt marketplace Bounce – Mobility solutions provider Bizongo – B2B packaging platform A B Capital spokesperson confirmed the departure, stating: “After more than eight years with the firm, Kabir Narang, who focused on later stage growth investing efforts in Asia, has left his role to pursue other opportunities. We are grateful for his contributions, and we wish him continued success in the future.” The New Investment Platform Vision Narang’s next venture represents a bold evolution in investment strategy. According to documents reviewed by Bitcoin World, his new investment platform, slated for launch in 2026, will focus on “compounding at the intersection of technology, AI, and global capital flows.” This approach signals a fundamental shift in how venture capital might operate in the coming decade. Narang articulated his vision in a note to founders: “We are living through one of the most profound technological revolutions in history, and one of the toughest tests of investor discipline. AI scales thought itself, compressing the gap between idea and output. The founders who pair that speed with pricing power and improving unit economics will define the next generation of enduring value.” Strategic Implications for Venture Capital The departure and new venture announcement come at a critical juncture for the global investment community. Narang’s move highlights several emerging trends in venture capital: Trend Impact Opportunity AI Integration Transforming investment analysis Faster, data-driven decisions Global Capital Flows Cross-border investment patterns Access to emerging markets Founder Relationships Personal investment stakes Stronger alignment of interests Narang revealed he will take 1–2% personal stakes in companies he believes can “compound intelligently,” suggesting a hybrid approach combining personal angel investing with institutional platform development. B Capital’s Continued Asia Strategy Despite Narang’s departure, B Capital remains committed to its Asian investment strategy. The firm confirmed that Eduardo Saverin, Karan Mohla, and Howard Morgan will manage its Asia portfolio alongside the existing team in South and Southeast Asia. “B Capital remains deeply committed to our strategy in Asia and our broader global platform,” the spokesperson emphasized. “With strong leadership and an experienced team across the region, we are well-positioned to capitalize on the next wave of innovation and continue backing category-defining companies across our core markets.” Founded in 2015 by Facebook co-founder Eduardo Saverin and former Bain Capital executive Raj Ganguly, B Capital manages more than $9 billion across nine offices in the U.S. and Asia. The firm maintains a strategic partnership with Boston Consulting Group to provide portfolio companies with operational support. What This Means for AI Startups Narang’s new focus on AI represents a significant opportunity for startups in the artificial intelligence space. His platform’s emphasis on “compounding at the intersection” suggests a sophisticated approach to identifying and nurturing AI companies that can achieve sustainable growth. Key considerations for startups seeking investment from the new platform: Demonstrable pricing power in AI solutions Improving unit economics as scale increases Clear path to global market expansion Strong intellectual property positioning Experienced founding teams with domain expertise Industry Context and Future Outlook Narang’s career trajectory provides important context for his new venture. Before joining B Capital, he spent nearly nine years at Fidelity-backed Eight Roads Ventures India as a managing director.

The fund, listed under the ticker BITW, combines leading cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin, Ethereum, XRP, Solana, and Cardano. It enters the market with $1.25 billion in assets under management, which places it among the largest crypto index offerings available today. The launch arrives at a moment when demand for regulated, diversified crypto exposure continues to rise. Consequently, investors now have a structured route into digital assets without tracking individual markets or selecting single tokens. New Rules-Based Structure Aims for Long-Term Market Alignment Bitwise shifted BITW from an index product into a fully exchange-traded structure after the SEC cleared the transition. The company built the fund around a rules-based index that ranks assets by market value while filtering them by risk and liquidity. Moreover, the ETF adjusts each month to reflect changing market conditions. The index currently allocates most of its weight to Bitcoin, which holds more than 74% of the basket. Ethereum follows with roughly 15%, while other assets receive smaller shares. Bitwise CIO Matt Hougan said investors increasingly prefer regulated vehicles that remove the burden of selecting tokens. He pointed to rising institutional involvement and noted that structured exposure offers clarity during changing market cycles. Additionally, the firm uses public monthly index updates to maintain transparency and consistency across all holdings. Bitwise Expands Its Product Pipeline for 2025 Adoption The company excluded several assets in past years due to concerns about sustainability. Hence, speculative tokens such as LUNA never entered previous versions of the index even during their peak. Bitwise continues to apply that approach as it expands its product portfolio.

That would place SpaceX close to the level set by Saudi Aramco’s 2019 market debut, when the oil giant raised $29 billion. Reportedly, the talks remain private and sensitive, but management and advisers are working toward a listing as early as mid-to-late 2026. Some involved say the timing could slide into 2027 if markets turn rough. Reports this Friday said the company is also exploring a possible offering as soon as late next year. In recent days, Elon Musk and the board moved forward with the IPO process. They discussed fundraising plans, hiring for key finance and legal roles, and early ideas on how capital would be used. The faster road to public trading is tied to the growth of Starlink. The satellite network is expanding its direct-to-mobile service that lets phones link to space without towers. At the same time, work on Starship for the Moon and Mars keeps pushing forward. One person familiar with internal numbers allegedly said revenue should reach about $15 billion in 2025. That figure is projected to rise to $22 billion to $24 billion in 2026. Most of that money is expected to come from Starlink. Executives see the satellite unit as the main cash engine that makes large-scale fundraising possible without relying only on launch contracts. This shift is priced into plans. Some of the IPO money is planned for space-based data centers. Two people said funds would also go toward buying the chips needed to run those systems. Elon Musk spoke about the idea during a recent event with Baron Capital, where he linked orbital computing to future network demand. That spending line is separate from rockets and satellites and sits fully inside the digital infrastructure plan for the next cycle. Buybacks reset price as investors line up In the current secondary offering, SpaceX set a per-share price near $420. That move lifted the company’s implied value above the previously reported $800 billion level. Employees are allowed to sell roughly $2 billion in stock under this round. The company is also taking part by buying back a portion of those shares. One person tied the pricing strategy to a goal of setting a clear fair-market level before an IPO filing. Major holders include Peter Thiel’s Founder’s Fund, 137 Ventures led by Justin Fishner-Wolfson, Valor Equity Partners, Fidelity, and Google, selling 5% equals $40 billion versus Aramco’s 1.5% slice. On December 6, Elon Musk said on X that SpaceX has been cash-flow positive for many years and runs stock buybacks twice a year to give liquidity to workers and investors. He said valuation changes tie directly to progress with Starship, growth at Starlink, and efforts to secure global direct-to-cell spectrum that expands market reach. Talk of a Starlink spin-off has surfaced for years after Gwynne Shotwell, the company’s president, raised it in 2020. Timing stayed uncertain. In 2024, Bret Johnsen, the chief financial officer, said a Starlink IPO would happen “in the years to come.” He gave no date.

Here’s What 4 AIs Expect for Ripple (XRP),https://cryptopotato.com/1-or-new-ath-by-christmas-heres-what-4-ais-expect-for-ripple-xrp/,"Ripple’s XRP has headed south over the past several months and is currently trading at around $2.08, or 45% below the all-time high of $3.65 registered in the summer. The question now is whether the downtrend will intensify by Christmas or if the price is gearing up for a new peak. To get a clearer perspective, we asked four of the most widely used AI-powered chatbots to share their take on the matter. What’s More Likely? ChatGPT claimed that a plunge to $1 is possible given the current condition of the crypto market and the whale exodus witnessed as of late. Earlier this year, the large investors offloaded almost 1.5 billion XRP tokens in the span of just one month, whereas recently they sold an additional 510 million coins in a week. Such a sell-off is generally considered bearish, as it signals reduced confidence in the asset among this cohort of market participants. Some community members believe that whales have inside information about events that may significantly impact the price. As such, their coordinated selling spree could indicate an impending correction. In addition, their efforts might infuse panic among smaller players and prompt them to cash out as well. On the other hand, ChatGPT argued that a pump to a fresh historic peak by Christmas is “extremely” unlikely. “To reach a new ATH, XRP would need a 75% rally in weeks, which typically requires euphoria and enormous liquidity inflow not present right now,” it added. Grok, the AI chatbot integrated in the social media platform X, was more bullish. It estimated that a drop to $1 is “highly improbable and almost trivial” given the current price of $2.08. “XRP hasn’t traded below $1.80 since late November, and with ETF momentum building, the floor appears firm at $2.” The chabot sees the rise to a new ATH as the more plausible scenario, although describing such a rally as a “stretch.” It claimed the most likely price for XRP by Christmas will be in the $2-$2.50 range. Neither One Perplexity argued that there’s almost no chance of XRP crashing to $1 or surpassing $3.65 by December 25. It predicted that the price may surge to a maximum of $3.10 in the event of a broader bull run in the crypto market. Google’s Gemini shared a similar stance, saying: “The most likely scenario is neither extreme, but rather a continuation of the current price trend (hovering in the $2 to $3 range) or a move higher towards the previous ATH without quite reaching it.” The post $1 or New ATH by Christmas?

Tidal Trust has filed a groundbreaking application with the SEC for the Nicholas Bitcoin & Treasury After Dark ETF. This isn’t just another spot Bitcoin ETF ; it’s a fund designed to hold Bitcoin exclusively when the U.S. stock markets are closed. This innovative structure aims to capture a specific market dynamic, potentially offering a fresh approach for investors. How Does This Unique Bitcoin ETF Work? The proposed fund’s strategy is remarkably clear-cut. It operates on a strict schedule tied to U.S. market hours. During the regular trading day (9:30 AM to 4:00 PM ET), the fund’s assets will be held in conservative instruments like: U.S. Treasury securities Money market funds Cash and cash equivalents However, as the closing bell rings, the strategy flips. The fund will transition its holdings to Bitcoin for the entire after-hours period, only to liquidate that position and return to Treasuries at the next market open. This creates a pure play on Bitcoin’s price action outside of traditional equity trading windows. Why Target After-Hours Trading for a Bitcoin ETF? The rationale behind this structure is data-driven. As noted by Bloomberg ETF analyst Eric Balchunas, a significant portion of Bitcoin’s historical returns have occurred outside standard market hours. This can be due to several factors: Global trading activity continues 24/7, while U.S. markets are closed. Major news and announcements often happen in the evening or early morning. It isolates Bitcoin’s price movement from direct correlation with the intraday swings of the S&P 500 or Nasdaq. Therefore, this Bitcoin ETF is built on the hypothesis that the most lucrative moments for Bitcoin happen when Wall Street is asleep. It offers a targeted, time-specific exposure unlike any existing product. What Are the Potential Benefits and Challenges? This novel structure presents a compelling case. For investors, it could provide a way to gain Bitcoin exposure that is deliberately uncoupled from the daytime noise of the stock market. It functions almost as a specialized hedge or a tactical sleeve within a broader portfolio. However, challenges exist. The constant buying and selling at market open and close could lead to tracking error and incur transaction costs. Furthermore, investor adoption depends on belief in the persistent after-hours outperformance thesis. Regulatory approval from the SEC for this unique model is also a key hurdle to clear. How Could This Reshape Crypto Investment Products? The filing signals a maturation in the crypto ETF space. Moving beyond simple spot or futures-based products, issuers are now experimenting with sophisticated, rules-based strategies. The Nicholas Bitcoin & Treasury After Dark ETF represents a move towards thematic and tactical crypto funds. If successful, it could pave the way for a new category of time-based or volatility-targeted cryptocurrency ETFs. This innovation demonstrates that the integration of digital assets into traditional finance is moving into a more nuanced and strategic phase. Conclusion: A Strategic Step Forward Tidal Trust’s proposed fund is a bold experiment in product design. It directly addresses an observed market behavior—Bitcoin’s after-hours momentum—and packages it into a regulated, accessible ETF wrapper. While its success depends on execution, costs, and SEC approval, it undeniably pushes the boundary of what a cryptocurrency investment vehicle can be. For the savvy investor, it promises a new, precise tool for crypto allocation. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q: What is the main difference between this ETF and other Bitcoin ETFs? A: Unlike standard spot Bitcoin ETFs that hold the asset continuously, this fund only holds Bitcoin during U.S. after-hours and overnight periods, switching to Treasuries during the regular trading day. Q: Who might invest in this after-hours Bitcoin ETF? A: It may appeal to investors who believe Bitcoin’s major price moves happen outside traditional market hours and want targeted exposure to that specific window, potentially as a complement to a daytime portfolio. Q: What are the risks of this strategy? A> Key risks include tracking error from daily transactions, potential transaction costs from frequent trading, and the possibility that the after-hours outperformance trend may not continue. Q: Has the SEC approved this Bitcoin ETF? A> Not yet. Tidal Trust has filed the application (Form N-1A), and it is now under review by the SEC. The approval process can take several months. Q: When would this ETF trade? A> The ETF shares themselves would trade on an exchange like the NYSE Arca during regular market hours, but its underlying holdings would be Bitcoin only after those hours end.

This colossal USDC transfer , first flagged by the blockchain tracker Whale Alert, involves one of the largest stablecoin movements of the year and raises critical questions about market sentiment and institutional strategy. What Does This Massive USDC Transfer Mean? The transaction saw exactly 300,000,000 USDC move from an address labeled “Coinbase Institutional” to a private, unidentified wallet. Valued at approximately $300 million, the sheer size of this USDC transfer immediately captures attention. Large movements like this are often orchestrated by entities colloquially known as “crypto whales”—individuals or institutions holding enough capital to potentially influence market prices. While the exact purpose remains shrouded in mystery, such a significant withdrawal from a custodial service like Coinbase Institutional typically signals a strategic shift. The recipient wallet’s anonymity adds a layer of intrigue, making it a focal point for analysts trying to decipher the next big move in digital assets. Why Would a Whale Move $300M in USDC? Understanding the potential motives behind this USDC transfer requires looking at common whale behavior. These are not random acts; they are calculated financial decisions. Let’s explore the most likely scenarios: Preparing for a Major Purchase: The whale could be moving funds off-exchange to execute a large, over-the-counter (OTC) trade for another cryptocurrency like Bitcoin or Ethereum, avoiding slippage on public order books. Seeking Yield or DeFi Opportunities: The funds might be destined for a decentralized finance (DeFi) protocol to earn interest through lending, liquidity provision, or staking, activities often conducted from private wallets. Custody and Security: The entity may simply be moving assets to a more secure, self-custodied wallet for long-term holding, a practice known as “cold storage.” Institutional Treasury Management: This could be part of routine treasury operations for a corporation, hedge fund, or venture capital firm managing its digital asset reserves. How Do Large USDC Transfers Impact the Market? A USDC transfer of this magnitude is more than just a line on a blockchain explorer; it’s a market signal. Stablecoins like USDC act as the primary on-ramp and off-ramp for crypto trading. Therefore, their movement provides clues about capital flow. When USDC leaves a major exchange, it often indicates that the holder is not looking to sell it for fiat currency immediately. Instead, they are positioning the capital within the crypto ecosystem. This can be interpreted as a bullish signal for other digital assets, as the stablecoin is now “dry powder” ready to be deployed. However, if multiple large withdrawals occur, it might also suggest whales are battening down the hatches, moving to safety ahead of perceived market volatility. Key Takeaways from This $300M Transaction This event underscores several enduring truths in the cryptocurrency space. First, blockchain transparency allows anyone to monitor these monumental transactions in real-time, a radical shift from traditional finance. Second, the activity of large holders remains a powerful, though not infallible, indicator of broader market trends. For the average investor, the lesson is not to blindly follow whale movements but to understand the context. A single USDC transfer , while impressive, is just one data point in a complex market. It highlights the importance of: Monitoring on-chain data for context. Understanding the difference between exchange flows and internal wallet movements. Recognizing that stablecoin liquidity is the lifeblood of the crypto trading ecosystem. Conclusion: Decoding the Signal in the Noise The movement of 300 million USDC is a powerful reminder of the scale and sophistication at play in today’s cryptocurrency markets. While the destination wallet is unknown, the transaction itself speaks volumes about the growing maturity of institutional involvement. This USDC transfer likely represents strategic capital allocation rather than panic or exit. It shows that major players are actively managing vast sums within the blockchain economy, using stablecoins as a crucial tool for liquidity and positioning. For savvy observers, these on-chain narratives are becoming essential for understanding the market’s underlying currents. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What is USDC?

This substantial investment marks a pivotal moment for the RWA tokenization sector, signaling strong institutional confidence in transforming physical assets into digital tokens. But what does this mean for the future of finance? What Does Real Finance’s $29M Funding Mean for RWA Tokenization? The recent private funding round for Real Finance represents more than just capital injection—it’s a validation of the entire RWA tokenization concept. According to Cointelegraph, the round attracted notable participants including Nimbus Capital, Magnus Capital, and the Precaz Group. These investors aren’t just betting on a company; they’re backing a fundamental shift in how we manage and trade real-world assets through blockchain technology. This funding achievement comes at a crucial time when traditional finance and decentralized systems are increasingly intersecting. The substantial $29 million commitment demonstrates that serious players see tangible value in bridging physical assets with digital liquidity. Moreover, it positions Real Finance as a leading force in what many consider blockchain’s next major evolution. How Will Real Finance Use This Investment Capital? The company has outlined clear strategic priorities for deploying its newly acquired resources. First and foremost, Real Finance plans to establish a robust regulatory compliance framework. This focus on regulation is particularly important for RWA tokenization , which operates at the intersection of traditional finance laws and emerging blockchain regulations. Additionally, the funding will support significant upgrades to operational systems. These improvements will likely enhance: Security protocols for asset tokenization and management Platform scalability to handle increased transaction volumes User experience for both institutional and individual participants Integration capabilities with existing financial infrastructure By strengthening these core areas, Real Finance aims to create a more reliable and accessible platform for RWA tokenization . This approach addresses one of the sector’s persistent challenges: building trust through both technological excellence and regulatory compliance. Why Is RWA Tokenization Gaining So Much Attention? The growing interest in RWA tokenization stems from its potential to solve several longstanding financial challenges. Traditional assets like real estate, commodities, and intellectual property often suffer from limited liquidity and accessibility. Tokenization changes this dynamic by creating digital representations that can be traded more freely and divided into smaller units. Real Finance’s successful funding round highlights several key benefits driving adoption: Increased liquidity for traditionally illiquid assets Fractional ownership opportunities for smaller investors Transparent tracking of asset provenance and ownership Reduced transaction costs through blockchain efficiency However, the path forward isn’t without obstacles. Regulatory uncertainty remains a significant hurdle for widespread RWA tokenization adoption. Different jurisdictions have varying approaches to digital asset classification and trading. This is precisely why Real Finance’s focus on compliance frameworks is so strategically important. What’s Next for Real Finance and the RWA Sector? With $29 million in fresh capital, Real Finance is positioned to accelerate its development timeline significantly. The company’s emphasis on regulatory compliance suggests a mature approach to growth—one that prioritizes sustainable expansion over rapid but risky scaling. This measured strategy could help establish important industry standards for RWA tokenization platforms. Looking ahead, we can expect several developments from Real Finance and similar platforms: Enhanced partnerships with traditional financial institutions Broader asset classes available for tokenization Improved interoperability between different blockchain networks Greater institutional adoption as regulatory clarity improves The success of this private funding round serves as an important signal to the broader market. It demonstrates that sophisticated investors see real potential in blockchain applications beyond cryptocurrency trading. As Real Finance deploys its resources, the entire RWA tokenization ecosystem stands to benefit from the infrastructure and standards they help establish. Conclusion: A Transformative Moment for Asset Management Real Finance’s $29 million funding achievement represents more than just financial success—it marks a validation of blockchain’s practical utility in transforming traditional finance. The substantial investment from respected firms like Nimbus Capital and Magnus Capital provides crucial momentum for the entire RWA tokenization sector. As the company focuses on regulatory compliance and system upgrades, it’s paving the way for more secure, accessible, and efficient asset management through blockchain technology. The journey toward mainstream RWA tokenization adoption continues to face challenges, particularly around regulation and standardization. However, with significant capital now supporting platforms like Real Finance, the infrastructure needed to overcome these obstacles is rapidly developing. This funding round may well be remembered as a turning point where real-world asset tokenization moved from theoretical promise to practical implementation. Frequently Asked Questions What is RWA tokenization? RWA tokenization is the process of converting rights to a real-world asset—like real estate, art, or commodities—into digital tokens on a blockchain. These tokens represent ownership or value and can be traded more easily than the physical assets themselves. Who invested in Real Finance’s funding round? The $29 million private funding round included participation from Nimbus Capital, Magnus Capital, and the Precaz Group. These are established investment firms with experience in both traditional finance and emerging technologies. Why is regulatory compliance important for RWA tokenization? Since tokenized assets intersect with existing financial regulations, compliance frameworks ensure legal operation, protect investors, and facilitate integration with traditional financial systems. This builds trust and enables broader adoption. What types of assets can be tokenized? Virtually any asset with identifiable value can be tokenized, including real estate, precious metals, fine art, intellectual property, and even future revenue streams. The technology enables fractional ownership of these assets. How does tokenization benefit investors? Tokenization increases liquidity, enables fractional ownership (lowering entry barriers), provides transparent ownership records, reduces transaction costs, and creates new markets for previously illiquid assets. What challenges does the RWA tokenization sector face? Key challenges include regulatory uncertainty across different jurisdictions, technological standardization, establishing trust with traditional investors, and creating robust legal frameworks for digital ownership rights.

Ripple’s engagement around the 2-dollar level and the unbroken inflow trend into XRP spot ETFs have improved the sentiment for the short term. At the same time, the ramping up of the presale of Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has caught the attention of many investors trying to determine the best crypto to invest in before the values change. XRP Holding The Two-Dollar Line As ETF Activity Picks Up XRP has been trading in a tumultuous week after falling into the 2-dollar battlefield in reaction to the rejection of a move at $2.2. Despite the fall, the XRP spot ETF market has recorded the 14th day of continuous inflows in a row. This was seen in the additional $12.84 million recorded in the books of the XRP spot ETF market on December 4. Franklin’s XRPZ recorded the highest inflow in the market. XRPC has remained the strongest token since its inception. Despite the presence of all these complications in the market, the short-term setup for XRP is constructive. Technical analysts have forecasted possible movements back to $2.35 and even $2.50 in the coming weeks, considering that the inflows into the ETF have held up well and there have been no disturbances in risk appetite. However, while the growth of XRP has remained highly dependent on policy expectations and inflows, the advancement of Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has remained linked to the achievement of key development milestones. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Fast Moving Presale The presale of Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has reached a critical point in Phase 6, nearing completion at 98%. The current pricing of $0.035 per token in Phase 6 remains the last prior to Phase 7, during which the token pricing will jump to $0.04. This denotes a significant jump of almost 20%. There has been a significant swell in interest since the platform has raised $19,200,000 and reached the milestone of 18,380 holders since the inception of the presale. Investors tracking the top cryptos to invest in the current scenario have appreciated the 250% growth over the Phase 1 cost of $0.01. Demand continues to build given the short window of opportunity to enter on this level. Investors subscribing to the impending $0.06 launch price have already positioned for a 400% gain relative to the current price, further solidifying the growing mention of MUTM in the top cryptos to buy for the coming year. Additionally, there was also the launch of the live holder dashboard containing a leaderboard of the top 50 investors in the ecosystem, in which the 24-hour leaderboard update rewards the top investor of the day $500 in MUTM for their contributions after one successful transaction. Dual Lending Structure Meanwhile, the plans for the upcoming lending platform launch for the Mutuum Finance token (MUTM) involve the Peer-to-Contract market for collective asset pools and the Peer-to-Peer market for isolated loans. The hybrid approach aims to serve the needs of the different communities in terms of flexibility and risk. ETH and USDT will be the initial pair of tokens integrated into the network when the protocol launches on the Sepolia testnet in Q4 2025. Investors searching for the next big cryptocurrency also continue to notice that functionality directly related to the utility of the protocol seems to offer a more positive influence in the long run. Buying The More Favorable ROI Choice Assessing the cryptos to invest in will always guide traders to the one that promises long-term functionality. XRP’s success in the ETF market helps in short-term trading, but the close-to-sold-out Phase 6 of Mutuum Finance (MUTM) and the upcoming protocol launch give hope for the sort of 20x gains that more developed cryptos cannot. Those about to invest for 2026 can have the benefit of assessing one of the last discounted phases of the MUTM presale.

The unexpected move comes at a time when the market is experiencing significant volatility, with Bitcoin trading at an uncharacteristically low price and XRP experiencing a downtrend . Despite choppy market conditions, the analyst is highly confident in the altcoin’s future performance. Crypto Investor Sells Entire Bitcoin Stash To Buy XRP A crypto entrepreneur who goes by Crypto X AiMan on X social media shocked the broader market this week by announcing that he had sold his entire Bitcoin position and moved the proceeds into XRP. The crypto investor unapologetically declared he had gone 100% all-in on the token. The unexpected pivot sparked instant reactions, with many in the crypto community voicing similar optimism for the altcoin and admitting they have already made, or plan to make, the same move. In his post, AiMan explained that his primary reason for the sudden portfolio switch was the level of regulatory clarity that XRP gained in the United States after the resolution of its prolonged legal battle with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). While the broader legal landscape around digital assets is still evolving, the crypto investor argues that XRP now holds a unique position as a non-security among established cryptocurrencies in the US. AiMan also highlighted Ripple’s considerable reserves and its more than 300 banking and payment partnerships as primary reasons for his decision to diversify into the third-largest cryptocurrency. At present, Ripple owns more than 45 billion XRP , representing over 45% of the total supply of 100 billion tokens. Under normal circumstances, such a concentration might raise concerns about centralization and excessive issuer control. However, AiMan has indicated that this level of institutional oversight is actually a strategic advantage. Additionally, the crypto investor pointed to Ripple’s partnerships with central banks and major financial institutions, especially those preparing for the ISO 20022 upgrade , which is expected to reset global messaging standards in 2026. With all of these in place, AiMan views the token as an asset with incredible potential. The crypto entrepreneur drew a comparison between the altcoin and BTC. He described Bitcoin as a form of digital gold that prioritizes scarcity and decentralization, but that faces limitations in speed and transaction costs. On the other hand, he portrayed XRP as a “digital dollar,” framing it as a more practical instrument for cross-border payments , designed to move value quickly and at low cost. Investor Embraces Full Risks As He Goes All In On The Altcoin In his post, AiMan acknowledged the significant risks of investing 100% of his BTC proceeds into XRP. He admitted that XRP could lose all of its value, leaving him with nothing. Despite this, he remained undeterred, emphasizing that if things go well, the potential rewards could be life-changing . He pointed out a stark contrast between Bitcoin’s current market capitalization of over $2 trillion and the global cross-border payments industry, which is valued at approximately $250 trillion. According to the crypto entrepreneur, if the altcoin were to capture just 1% of that market, its value could increase exponentially.",XRP|AiMan|bitcoin|btc|gold|ISO 20022 Upgrade|ripple|US SEC|US Securities and Exchange Commission|XRP news|XRP price|XRPUSD|XRPUSDT,EN,0,0,ALTCOIN|BTC|BUSINESS|XRP|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-12-09 22:00:33

Data shows that addresses in this cohort haven’t grown at all over the past two years, breaking a trend that held for more than a decade. The stagnation indicates a change in how smaller and mid-sized investors engage with Bitcoin, even as broader institutional activity in the market continues to rise. Small Holder Participation Reaches A Standstill The 0.1 BTC threshold has historically represented an important milestone for retail holders, large enough to signal commitment but small enough to remain widely attainable. For more than a decade, wallets crossing that line grew year after year, even during drawdowns when long-term buyers were accumulating quietly. Related Reading: The $13.5 Billion Liquidity Injection That Could Send Bitcoin And Crypto Prices Flying That pattern is no longer intact. The number of addresses with more than 0.1 BTC has flattened since 2023 and is showing no signs of returning to its previous trajectory. Particularly, data from the on-chain analytics platform Santiment shows that the number of these addresses has stalled at around 4.44 million for the past year. This suggests that fewer new participants are choosing to build self-custodied Bitcoin positions at this level. The stagnation becomes more notable considering Bitcoin’s rising mainstream visibility and repeated pushes toward new all-time highs this year. In earlier cycles, such conditions have led to a surge in retail accumulation. This time, the address count has stayed frozen, and this means retail addresses holding Bitcoin might actually be plateauing. How Bitcoin’s Holder Base Is Changing Although on-chain data points to a slowdown in the growth of overall Bitcoin addresses holding more than 0.1 BTC, it doesn’t necessarily signal a decline in overall adoption. For many market participants, Bitcoin exposure now happens entirely off-chain. Related Reading: Confirming The Bitcoin Price Direction: Analyst Reveals What You Should Look Out For Larger investor cohorts, from high-net-worth individuals to funds and corporate entities, are buying huge amounts of Bitcoin. For instance, Santiment data shows that large Bitcoin holders controlling more than 100 BTC have increased their balances throughout 2024 and 2025, even as smaller address cohorts have stalled. At the same time, more investors are choosing to access Bitcoin through custodial avenues instead of managing their own wallets. Spot Bitcoin ETFs have become one of the most important gateways for new BTC exposure. In the US alone, Spot Bitcoin ETFs now control almost $120 billion worth of Bitcoin, with BlackRock’s IBIT consistently recording the strongest demand. Together, these developments point to a new phase in Bitcoin’s development. What was once dominated by individual self-custodied users is now increasingly shaped by institutions, ETFs, funds, and professionally managed capital. Therefore, the numbers from on-chain wallet metrics reflect a smaller portion of the actual user base.

Questions of unauthorized transaction, a secret 2 billion Pi token dump, and deliberately delayed network migration have sparked an exodus, with the altcoin down 5%. According to court filings , plaintiff Harro Moen claims the scheme unfolded over several years and caused significant financial damage. He is seeking $10 million in damages. Is a lawsuit really going to be filed against #PiNetwork ? I don't know if this is true or false, but I do know that its value will soon decrease, and people's trust in it will also diminish. @PiCoreTeam needs to respond now. pic.twitter.com/fMDQj5ouCD — The Times of PiNetwork (@PiNetwork24X7) December 7, 2025 Moen credits an April 10, 2024 unauthorized transfer of 5,137 PI tokens from his verified wallet to an unknown address to a scheme to dump over 2 billion PI of user funds. He further added that the situation was worsened by the failure to migrate his remaining 1,403 tokens to the Pi Network Mainnet, exposing him to heavy unrealised losses. The complaint also argues that despite marketing Pi Network as decentralized, the defendants allegedly maintained centralized control by operating only three validator nodes. These accusations threaten to worsen Pi Network’s biggest pain point: adoption. The project already lacks a meaningful use case to sustain long-term growth, and now builders may sideline the layer-1 entirely. Its liquidity strain may deepen further, with short-term speculative trading amplifying deflationary pressure as token unlocks continue at an average pace of 6.1 million PI per day.

The controversy comes as the PI coin price tests a strong confluence of support with the lower boundary of a 2-month ascending triangle and the 0.5 Fib retracement level.

The RSI has bounced from near-oversold levels, typically a bottom marker in corrections. The MACD also slowly closes in on a golden cross above the signal line, a sign of growing strength. As a launchpad, this support could set up a breakout to the patterns $0.40 target, an 8-% gain from current prices. Still, the lawsuit could dent bearish sentiment enough to disrupt the slow growth. A breakdown targets all-time lows, 30% lower at $0.15. And below that lies a dangerous gap area, with little historical support to cushion downside, which opens the door to a 65% decline to the 1.618 Fib retracement at $0.075. Bitcoin Hyper: A Layer-2 Attracting Talk For Better Reasons Those who jumped to Pi Network as an alternative Layer 1 to the leading crypto may be forced to reconsider, as the Bitcoin ecosystem finally addresses its biggest limitation: ecosystem growth.

The measures aimed at curbing electricity theft in the sector include hefty fines and prison sentences as the country faces another cold winter amid power shortages. Tajikistan to fight illegal mining with fines and jail time The government of Tajikistan is introducing criminal punishment and financial penalties for unauthorized consumption of electricity to mint digital coins. That’s according to legislative amendments recently approved by the Central Asian nation’s bicameral legislature, local media revealed. An article prosecuting the “illegal use of electricity for the production of a virtual assets” has been added to the country’s Criminal Code, the Asia-Plus portal reported on Tuesday. Under its provisions, individuals who power mining hardware against the law are subject to a fine of between 15,000 and 37,000 somoni (approx. $1,600 – $4,000). In case of an organized group, its members will be fined up to 75,000 somoni (a little over $8,000). They will also be facing imprisonment for two to five years. Electricity theft on an “especially large scale” for the same purpose will carry longer sentences – five to eight years behind bars, the news outlet detailed. Presenting the draft to the parliament, Tajikistan’s Prosecutor General Habibullo Vohidzoda pointed out that the stealing of electric energy through crypto farms has caused shortages in a number of cities and regions. The phenomenon has led authorities to impose restrictions on electricity supplies and “created conditions conducive to the commission of various crimes,” the official elaborated. He was also quoted as stating: “The illegal circulation of virtual assets facilitates a number of crimes, such as electricity theft, material damage to the state, money laundering, and other offenses.” Vohidzoda highlighted the numerous cases of crypto farms found to be illegally connected to the grid across the former Soviet republic, noting that several investigations have been launched already. The prosecutor alleged that the illicit operation of energy-hungry mining hardware in Tajikistan is to blame for 32 million somoni (around $3.5 million) in financial losses for the state. He also remarked that some of the implicated individuals have been importing coin minting equipment from abroad, again in breach of national law. The adopted amendments aim to prevent tax evasion by those engaged in cryptocurrency mining, as well, noted Shukhrat Ganizoda, a member of the Tajik legislature. The changes will enter into force after the passed bill is signed into law by President Emomali Rahmon and published in Tajikistan’s official gazette. Miners blamed for power shortages across the region Nations in Central Asia and the former Soviet space attracted Bitcoin miners in the wake of Beijing’s decision to enforce a ban on crypto mining a few years ago. Among them are the regional economic powerhouse, Kazakhstan, and Russia, which border it to the North. In both nations, crypto miners have been blamed for electricity shortages. Kazakhstan dealt with the issue by introducing strict regulations and increasing electricity rates for mining enterprises. The country recently lifted some restrictions on the industry. The Russian Federation, which only recently legalized cryptocurrency mining by adopting dedicated legislation in 2024, is still trying to contain the issue. Since the beginning of the year, Moscow has completely banned or limited mining in more than 10 regions with high concentrations of crypto farms. At the start of this week, Deputy Prime Minister Alexander Novak announced that the Russian government intends to criminalize illegal mining activities, as reported by Cryptopolitan. Last month, Tajikistan’s northern neighbor, Kyrgyzstan, shut down all crypto mining facilities operating in its territory, citing growing power deficits during the cold winter months.
