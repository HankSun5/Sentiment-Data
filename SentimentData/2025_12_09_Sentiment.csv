The company currently sits on a paper loss of $158 million, with the company also set to acquire Semler Scientific to expand its portfolio of Bitcoin. Holders of the Variable Rate Series A Perpetual Preferreds are set to see their distributions reduced from next year. These currently have a 13% current yield. Strive Asset Management, LLC ( ASST ) offers a jumbled and, in my opinion, currently hard to invest in Bitcoin (BTC-USD) as a treasury business strategy that aimed to ride the bandwagon established by Strategy ( MSTR ) but faces headwinds from elevated financing costs and a constrained premium to its BTC holdings. The company owned 7,525 BTC as of its most recent purchase of the cryptocurrency, with this bought at an average price of $113,383 per BTC for an aggregate nominal amount of $853.21 million. With BTC currently valued at $92,438, around $695 million in aggregate, ASST sits on a significant paper loss of around $158 million. While bulls would be right to highlight a market cap of $859 million puts ASST's mNAV at a decent 1.24x, this is far below MSTR's premium that was well north of 2x before the recent BTC dip. BTC as a treasury is anchored on constant access to the capital market to raise funds recycled into buying BTC. ASST needs to be able to continually sell its common equity to achieve this, but would see its BTC per share come in at a materially lower clip in the event its mNAV continues to narrow. Strive ASST's philosophy in a crowded marketplace of global BTC treasury companies is to focus on BTC per share and use the cryptocurrency as its hurdle rate for deploying capital. The hurdle rate is a term mainly used in private equity that describes the minimum rate of return required on an investment. ASST, which is the 14th largest publicly listed BTC as a treasury company, is likely describing a policy to BTC purchasing policy that limits new buys on pre-determined BTC per share metrics. The company is young, only going public in September through a merger with Asset Entities. ASST has since gone on to engineer an all-stock acquisition of Semler Scientific ( SMLR ). The deal would see ASST pay SMLR $90.52 per share, which represented a 210% premium at the time the acquisition was announced. Strive Website The Variable Rate Preferreds, Semler Scientific, Liquidity, And Cash Burn SMLR is currently trading for $20.33 per share at a $310 million market capitalization. It also currently owns 5,048 BTC, valued at $467 million. The clear mismatch between SMLR's current market cap, the implied acquisition market cap at $1.38 billion, and the value of SMLR's BTC holdings reflects the upside-down nature of the deal. The overall BTC as a treasury strategy depends on the constant tapping of investor euphoria to issue shares at a strong premium to buy BTC. The mismatch reflects the sustained pullback of BTC since the deal was announced, and a likelihood that the deal will be significantly altered. It simply does not make sense for ASST to pay $1.38 billion for BTC that's valued at less than half of this amount. It's entirely against ASST's own philosophy to focus on BTC per share, as they could just sell half the amount of shares they would need to exchange for the acquisition and own more BTC at current prices. For investors looking for BTC exposure, it won't make sense to pay such a premium when direct ownership or the use of an ETF would net more BTC. QuantumOnline ASST currently has a Variable Rate Series A Perpetual Preferred Stock ( SATA ) outstanding. These started trading shortly after the firm's IPO and is set to be used along with a $450 million at-the-market (""ATM"") common stock offering shelf, and cash and cash equivalents on its balance sheet of $109 million as of the end of the fiscal 2025 third quarter to buy BTC. There were 2 million shares of SATA offered, upsized by 750,000 shares from the prior announcement, with the shares sold for $80 per share for gross proceeds of $160 million. The preferreds currently pay a $12 annual coupon , in monthly distributions, for a 13% current yield as they're currently swapping hands for $91.61 per share. QuantumOnline Further, as they're perpetual, ASST is under no obligation to redeem these at any point. They have a $100 per share liquidation value, so they're currently trading hands at an 8.4% discount to this. This works for investors looking for a forever income security, but in aggregate with the unique variable terms of the preferreds, raises significant risk that ASST will face headwinds in making what's currently a $24 million per year coupon payment. ASST needs constant access to the capital markets to be able to copy the MSTR strategy, so the use of monthly distributions and selling the preferreds at a discount was meant as sweeteners to get investors on board with the offering. Seeking Alpha ASST can start reducing the variable payments from three months after its IPO. This is limited to the aggregate of 25 basis points and the excess of one-month term SOFR on the first business day of the relevant distribution, over the minimum of the one-month term SOFR from the previous distribution period. As ASST pays out monthly, this implies that it can, from the first quarter of next year, reduce the distribution on the preferreds by at least 25 basis points per month, around 300 basis points per year. This would compress its coupon rate from 12% to 9% over 12 months at a minimum, lower than the 10% MSTR pays to the holders of some of its preferreds. SATA is up from its IPO as they were sold at such a steep discount, but the December Fed rate cut, in aggregate with a weak BTC price and the eventual 3-month hurdle, is likely set to see these trade lower. Cash flow from operations was $22.1 million during the third quarter, with ASST's cash balance set to cover this rate of operational cash burn by just under 5 quarters. However, the company maintains access to capital markets with an ongoing ATM program and can tap its BTC holdings for sales to meet its operational cash burn needs and extend its cash runway. Conclusion ASST's BTC holdings are upside-down, trading at a significant loss to its average buy price, just as its stock continues to dip. This is now down 92.4% from their 52-week-high. There are now far too many BTC as treasury companies available to investors to buy, with the list north of 100, not including the ETFs.

As the top meme coin bounces off a key support, could this favor a bullish Dogecoin price prediction ? According to data from BitInfoCharts, the number of daily active addresses (DAAs) within the Dogecoin blockchain spiked to its second highest level in three months on December 3 at 67,511. The highest reading during this period occurred on September 15, back when DOGE hit a local top of $0.30 and started retreating to its current levels. What this metric may have indicated back then is that a significant number of wallets were both buying and selling, as the price hit a high level. This time, following a 50% retreat from those highs, this could be evidence that this is a highly contested area for both bulls and bears again. Interestingly, DOGE has gone up by 3.5% in the past 24 hours and currently stands at $0.14. This has been a key area of support for the token from which it has bounced three times already. Trading volumes have more than doubled, further confirming that buying pressure is increasing rapidly. Paired with higher wallet usage, could Dogecoin be getting ready to reverse its downtrend? Dogecoin Price Prediction: Key Levels to Watch as $0.14 Holds Strong Dogecoin has gone up today, and trading volumes are accompanying the move as the token bounces from the $0.14 level. Source: TradingView The pivotal area for DOGE is the $0.16 mark, as a move above this area would confirm a trend reversal and finally break the token’s bearish structure. The first and most likely target if this happens would be the 200-day exponential moving average (EMA), as this is typically a high-volume price zone. Meanwhile, a bullish breakout above this key line would confirm a positive mid-term outlook for Dogecoin. If that’s the case, we could see the token spiking back to its September 2025 levels, back when daily active addresses reached their 3-month peak. This week is critical for the markets as the Federal Reserve will convene on Wednesday to make a decision on interest rates. A rate cut could be exactly what the market needs to propel crypto prices back to their recent highs . As the meme coin market gears up for a potential breakout, all eyes are shifting to early-stage presales with the highest upside. Maxi Doge ($MAXI) is one of the most talked-about presales in the space right now, and with momentum building fast, it could be the next major gainer once listings go live. Maxi Doge ($MAXI) Raises Over $4 Million Despite the Market’s Turmoil The latest wave of selling has not deterred investors from piling into Maxi Doge ($MAXI) . This new meme coin embodies the hype that comes with bull markets and aims to build a thriving community of ‘degen’ traders who love taking big risks in exchange for big gains.

After months of sustained selling pressure and increased whale activity, the market is now watching whether Solana can hold its recent gains or slip back toward lower support zones. Related Reading: What’s Happening With XRP And Why Did Its Spot ETF Crash 20%? This comes at a time when analysts, on-chain trackers, and market participants are also assessing the broader influence of KOL (Key Opinion Leader) predictions, many of which have dramatically misaligned with Solana’s actual price trajectory over the past two months. SOL's price sees some small gains on the daily chart. Source: SOLUSD on Tradingview Solana Price Stalls Below Key Resistance SOL is currently trading just under $138 after a modest recovery from the $128 low. Technical data indicates that the Solana price is struggling beneath a dense cluster of moving averages, with the 20-day EMA at $138 repeatedly rejecting upward attempts. The intraday structure remains corrective, as rallies tend to fade before gaining traction. A sustained close above $140 remains the key threshold. Clearing it could open immediate targets near $142 and later $150. However, failure at this level risks renewed pullbacks toward $132, and deeper weakness could revisit $128 region. Short-term indicators offer mixed signals. The hourly RSI remains above 50, while the MACD leans slightly bullish, suggesting that momentum exists but lacks conviction. KOL Predictions Scrutinized as Market Cap Declines Solana’s market cap has fallen roughly 40.5% over the past two months, contradicting bullish influencer claims made earlier in the quarter. Data from Santiment shows how traders predict a near-term all-time high, only for SOL to continue its downward slide. This divergence is leading analysts to lean more heavily on tools like the KOLs_Tracker, which ranks influencer performance and helps identify when certain calls may function as contrarian signals. The gap between predictions and actual performance has added an extra layer of volatility to Solana’s narrative, as traders use social sentiment data alongside traditional indicators to gauge market direction. With network activity and flows still subdued, traders are approaching such predictions with increased caution. Liquidity Shifts Highlight Whale Influence On-chain activity shows notable movement from large holders, including a whale that recently transferred 100,000 SOL to Binance, part of a broader trend that has seen over 600,000 SOL moved to exchanges since April. While not enough to move the market on its own, such consistent selling reinforces resistance zones and limits recovery momentum. The address still holds more than 700,000 SOL, meaning additional liquidity could enter the market if the Solana price approaches previously favored selling levels. Related Reading: Ethereum Founder Breaks Silence With Major Upgrade Proposal As the Solana price deals with this tight range, market participants remain focused on whether buyers can establish a base above $138–$140. Until then, resistance remains firm, sentiment remains cautious, and the path forward depends on both technical confirmation and the broader crypto market direction.

Speaking at the Bitcoin MENA event in Abu Dhabi, Saylor suggested countries could use overcollateralized Bitcoin reserves and tokenized credit assets to launch regulated digital bank accounts that offer higher yields than traditional deposits. Saylor’s comments come as the CEOs of Citigroup, Wells Fargo, and Bank of America are scheduled to meet with both Republican and Democratic senators this week to discuss legislation focused on crypto market structure. As earlier reported by Cryptopolitan , Bank executives and U.S. senators are expected to gather on Thursday at the Financial Services Forum, a bank trade group that is organizing the meeting. “The meeting is another opportunity to share [the banks’] perspectives and serve as constructive partners in crafting smart policy to ensure the U.S. remains a digital assets leader,” a spokesperson for FSF said. Topics that are priority to cover include bank permissibility, as well as payment of interest and illicit finance, the spokesperson noted, adding that “meetings between our CEOs and lawmakers happen often.” Saylor underscored the motivation behind his proposal by pointing to low global yields. Bank deposits in Japan, Europe, and Switzerland provide little to no yield, Saylor pointed out, while euro money-market funds yield around 150 basis points, and US money-market rates remain closer to 400 basis points. This, he added, is why investors resort to the corporate bond market, which “wouldn’t exist if people weren’t so disgusted with their bank account.” New framework proposes overcollateralized BTC reserves Saylor described a framework in which digital credit products comprise approximately 80% of a fund, with another 20% in fiat currencies , and a 10% reserve buffer built on top to mitigate excess volatility. If such a product were available on a regulated bank’s platform, depositors could place billions of dollars in institutions to obtain larger deposits. The account would be backed by digital credit with 5:1 overcollateralization held by a treasury body, he added. In Saylor’s view, the country offering such accounts may attract “20 trillion or 50 trillion dollars” in additional capital flows. The CEO suggested that a country adopting this line could become the international “digital banking capital of the world.” The comments followed Saylor’s revelation on X that the company had purchased 10,624 BTC for roughly $962.7 million the previous week. The latest buy increases Strategy’s ownership of the asset to 660,624 BTC, purchased for about $49.35 billion at an average cost of $74,696. Saylor’s description of a high-yield, low-volatility digital bank product is reminiscent of some of what Strategy sells. In July, the company debuted STRC, a money-market-style preferred share with a variable dividend rate of around 10% and a structure designed to maintain its price near par while being backed by Strategy’s Bitcoin-linked treasury operations. Although the product has already grown to around $2.9 billion in market cap, it has also been met with some skepticism. Critics question volatility risks as Saylor expands BTC holdings Bitcoin’s volatility is one reason some observers question Saylor’s push for Bitcoin-backed, high-yield credit instruments. Bitcoin has delivered strong long-term returns, but its short-term performance remains unpredictable. Although the product has already reached a market capitalization of around $2.9 billion, it has also faced some skepticism. And Bitcoin’s volatility is one reason some people wonder whether Saylor’s push toward Bitcoin-backed credit instruments, with high yields, is too big a stretch. So far, Bitcoin has posted strong long-term returns, but it doesn’t give much insight into its immediate performance. Bitcoin has been trading at around $90,911 as of the time of this post, roughly 28% less than its record high of $126,080 on Oct. 6, and approximately 9% less over the past 12 months, according to CoinGecko. However, over five years, BTC has increased by 1,155% from $7,193 on January 1, 2020. During October, a former Salomon Brothers bond and derivatives trader, Josh Man, called Saylor’s moves “folly” and suggested STRC could suffer a liquidity event. He wrote: “The fiat banking system has been around a long time and has figured out how to build a moat around demand deposits so that they don’t break the buck. Hiking rates on STRC to maintain/defend a peg or price level is not going to work when depositors want to get their money back out.” Get $50 free to trade crypto when you sign up to Bybit now",News|Bitcoin,EN,0,0,BTC|FIAT|MARKET|REGULATION|TRADING|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-12-08 23:16:52

Economists are betting on a rate cut come Wednesday, which has helped to lift prices after a difficult few weeks for crypto. Bitcoin is up by 3% today, while altcoins such as Ethereum, Solana, and Cardano have posted gains closer to 4%, while Canton and Zcash are up by more than 13%. Now is therefore a good time to be reentering the market, and we’ve accordingly picked our next altcoin to turn $100 into $10,000, which is the exciting new ERC-20 token PEPENODE ($PEPENODE) . Next Altcoin to Turn $100 into $10,000 – 8 December First unveiled in September, PEPENODE has since gone on to raise more than $2.2 million in its ongoing presale, which is quickly attracting new converts. This figure provides a strong vote of confidence in the new project, which is aiming to make cryptocurrency mining more accessible to average investors. It will do this by enabling users to build and run their own virtual mining rigs, instead of requiring them to invest in expensive mining hardware, as proof-of-work cryptocurrencies do. By spending PEPENODE tokens on new virtual nodes and by upgrading and combining these nodes, users can earn greater mining rewards. PEPENODE pays out mining rewards in external tokens such as Fartcoin and Pepe, providing users with a very strong incentive to acquire more PEPENODE tokens in order to enhance their mining rigs. There may be multiple paths but they always lead back to one thing… Upgrading Those Nodes https://t.co/FaKIaBoHfa pic.twitter.com/L6mF94nPB9 — PEPENODE (@pepenode_io) December 8, 2025 Holders of the token will also be able to stake it for a passive income, with the current rate of return at 565% APY . This is hugely generous, and arguably makes PEPENODE one of the most attractive new tokens to invest in at the moment. PEPENODE Will Launch Soon: Here’s How to Buy Early Traders can invest in PEPENODE by going to its official website and joining its presale, which will run for several more weeks, at which point the coin will list on exchanges. PEPENODE will have a max supply of 210 billion tokens, with its allocation divided between development, marketing, node rewards, liquidity, and its treasury. It’s currently selling at a price of $0.0011825, although this price will continue to rise every three days until the same comes to an end. Investors can use ETH, USDT, BNB, or fiat to buy whatever amount of the token they want, and will receive their coins once the sale closes. Given the market appears to be preparing for a big comeback, now may be an ideal time for a new token launch. And because it has such strong fundamentals, PEPENODE is our next altcoin to turn $100 into $10,000.

He argues that multi-year low gas fees have bred complacency, with a massive shift in retail activity to cheaper Layer 2 networks like Base and Arbitrum sidelining the altcoin’s issue. Average Ethereum gas price. Source: Etherscan . His solution: an on-chain prediction market designed to help users secure future gas prices and mitigate sudden spikes in transaction costs on the network. We need a good trustless onchain gas futures market. (Like, a prediction market on the BASEFEE) I've heard people ask: ""today fees are low, but what about in 2 years? You say they'll stay low because of increasing gaslimit from BAL + ePBS + later ZK-EVM, but do I believe you?""… — vitalik.eth (@VitalikButerin) December 6, 2025 An on-chain futures curve would provide a clear signal of long-term market expectations. It would permit users to prepay for block space and lock in costs regardless of future spikes. With a shared reference point for future network conditions, developers could buy gas insurance to cap operating costs ahead of critical events, while heavy users could also offset future fee spikes by taking the opposite market position. This all amounts to a more favourable platform for users, facilitating the transition from web-2 to web-3 as blockchain technology needs the reliability expected at the institutional level. Ethereum Price Predictions: Adoption Could Fuel New All-Time Highs The potential adoption of controlled gas fees could bring to Ethereum could help fuel the breakout of a bullish 19-month head-and-shoulder pattern, now unfolding.

The RSI is closing in on the 50 neutral line, forming several higher lows as buyers step in. The MACD also displays a growing lead on the signal line, suggesting a sustained bullish trend. A fully realised pattern breakout could see the neckline reclaimed around $5,500 , reclaiming past all-time highs and entering new price discovery in a 90% move . But as the bull market matures, if Ethereum finds a bigger part to play in the transition from Web2 to Web3, the move could extend 250% to $10,000 .

Here’s The Latest,https://timestabloid.com/another-win-for-xrp-in-asia-heres-the-latest/,"Professional investors in Hong Kong now have direct access to XRP trading using the Hong Kong Dollar (HKD), following its addition to the lineup of assets available on OSL, one of the region’s licensed digital asset exchanges. The platform disclosed that XRP has been integrated into its Flash Trade service, broadening its market offerings for institutional-level users who operate under Hong Kong’s regulatory framework. OSL confirmed that both deposits and withdrawals for XRP are active on the XRP Ledger (XRPL). With this update, trading is available across three markets: XRP/HKD, XRP/USDT, and XRP/USD. Under local rules, only clients classified as Professional Investors can use this feature, and OSL emphasized that the restriction is consistent with the jurisdiction’s compliance standards. XRP is now available at OSL HK — secure, compliant access to one of the world’s most established digital assets. Renowned for its speed and efficiency in cross-border transactions, XRP expands OSL HK’s token lineup. Available to Professional Investors via Flash Trade &… pic.twitter.com/SWFUlCIta9 — OSL HK (@OSL_HK) December 5, 2025 Importance of the HKD Trading Pair The introduction of an XRP/HKD pair represents an important development for investors seeking direct exposure without relying on foreign stablecoins or multiple conversions. Although several licensed exchanges in Hong Kong support XRP, most only offer trading against stablecoins such as USDT. HashKey , for example, provides access to XRP but does not currently offer an HKD pair. OSL’s decision to enable HKD-based trading gives market participants a more convenient way to access the asset and reduces dependence on additional currency conversions. Hong Kong’s Supportive Regulatory Landscape Hong Kong continues to position itself as a welcoming environment for digital asset companies through clear and structured regulations. The government has taken steps to attract reputable industry players while maintaining oversight, resulting in a market that encourages innovation while adhering to compliance requirements. Within this environment, the availability of a direct HKD pair strengthens XRP’s presence and supports broader adoption among investors who prefer to operate within a recognized regulatory system. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 As part of the listing announcement, OSL outlined the characteristics that define XRP’s use case. The exchange noted that XRP is designed to facilitate low-cost cross-border transactions and microtransactions, supported by the XRPL’s rapid settlement time, which generally completes transfers within a few seconds. OSL also referenced the asset’s decentralized validator network and its ability to move value without centralized oversight. Market Context and Recent XRP Performance The listing arrives at a time when XRP has shown upward movement in the broader market. Over the past 24 hours, the asset recorded an increase of about 4.75%, reaching a price of $2.09 . This positive momentum, combined with expanded trading access in a regulated center like Hong Kong, may encourage renewed attention from institutional investors. By enabling XRP/HKD trading, OSL has created a more accessible pathway for professional investors and reinforced Hong Kong’s status as one of the few jurisdictions offering regulated fiat-paired XRP trading. This development simplifies entry into the asset, aligns with the region’s commitment to transparent digital asset activity, and enhances the range of trading options available to institutions operating within Hong Kong’s financial system.

The current plans offer valuable tax advantages, but they force investors to deal with narrow, state-selected mutual fund portfolios that underperform relative to IRAs and HSAs. According to the Bitcoin Policy Institute, those limitations prevent households from accessing inflation-resistant assets and stronger long-term growth opportunities. The Bitcoin Policy Institute’s research has evaluated how modernizing 529 plans to permit Bitcoin allocations could improve returns and better safeguard education savings, working on the premise of Bitcoin’s history of delivering strong long-term performance and offering diversification benefits due to its low correlation with equities. Bitcoin Policy Institute drums up BTC for 529 plans According to the findings, portfolio modeling shows that even small allocations of Bitcoin (1–2%) increase compound annual returns and Sharpe ratios, boosting portfolio efficiency without materially increasing risk. The policy recommends the issuance of federal guidance or amendment of the tax code to allow Bitcoin in 529 plans, aligning them with the investment flexibility of IRAs and HSAs, with claims that such a model would streamline nationwide adoption.‍ Another recommendation is to establish the first Bitcoin-inclusive 529 plan in Wyoming—the only state without a current plan and encourage states to update their 529 offerings by incorporating BTC and other alternative assets, expanding payment capabilities (such as ACH), and advocating for more flexible rules on portfolio adjustments. The bottom line is that modernizing 529 plans—through federal guidance, state innovation, or both—would expand investor choice, increase portfolio resilience, and align education savings strategies with today’s financial realities. Growing interest in digital assets at the state level The discussion happening around BTC and 529 plans is happening as momentum around crypto-linked retirement exposure continues to grow nationwide, with citizens of the US looking forward to using their retirement savings to invest in cryptocurrencies, private equity, property, gold and other kinds of non-traditional assets. The consensus right now is that a presidential executive order has cleared the way for fiduciaries to offer crypto investments as an option. However, it will take some time for widespread availability to be implemented. In the meantime, regulatory bodies are working on new guidance to facilitate the change. In Indiana, there is a newly introduced bill that would require public retirement programs to offer Bitcoin-related investment options and also limit how much power local governments have to restrict the use of digital assets. The proposal, known as House Bill 1042, was filed on Thursday, December 4, by State Representative Kyle Pierce, a Republican from Anderson, and was presented during a meeting of the House Financial Institutions Committee. Its main focus is on giving public workers access to cryptocurrency investments while setting clear legal boundaries around digital asset use, custody, payments, and mining. Aside from forcing administrators of several state-run retirement and savings plans to include cryptocurrency exchange-traded funds as standard investment choices, the proposal would also permit certain public pension funds to invest directly in crypto-linked ETFs and give the state treasurer authority to place funds from specific accounts into stablecoin-based ETFs. According to Pierce, the bill is designed to give Indiana residents more financial flexibility, balancing investment choice with regulatory guardrails while allowing the state to explore potential government use of blockchain technology through pilot programs. The bill also includes clear safeguards for self-custody, and if enacted, would make Indiana the first state in the country to require publicly managed retirement programs to provide Bitcoin exposure as a standard option. Other states have taken similar steps, but none as overt as Indiana. Last year, Oklahoma passed a law preserving residents’ right to hold crypto in self-custody wallets and blocking special taxes on Bitcoin transactions. Then this year, Kentucky did something similar by formally recognizing self-custody as a protected property right. Meanwhile, Wyoming approved laws that allow public pension funds to invest in digital assets, and Arizona introduced legislation that would allow Bitcoin ETFs in retirement accounts.

The operation started as a minor investigation into a simple fraudulent crypto platform. Gradually, it expanded into a complex probe of a vast, unscrupulous money-laundering network. How it Happened The thieves created and operated many forged cryptocurrency investment platforms. They used high-quality deepfake advertisements to make their projects seem legit. They repeatedly called their customers, promising massive returns on investment. They also showed their users fake proof of profits realized on their platforms, thereby attracting thousands to interact with and deposit funds into these fake crypto platforms. Once these naive crypto enthusiasts transferred their crypto assets to the fraudulent platforms, the criminals moved them across various crypto networks and exchanges, cashing out the funds and extending the chain of their actions. The criminal act targeted people from Spain, France, Belgium, Bulgaria, Germany, and Malta. Notably, it was not limited to Europe as some of the victims were from Cyprus and Israel, both West Asia countries. Hence, authorities from these affected countries were a part of the investigation. Authorities Takedown $815M Fraudsters The first phase of the operation was executed on 27 October 2025 and ended successfully. In response to requests from authorities in France and Germany, the police raided strategic locations in Cyprus, Germany, and Spain, arresting nine individuals suspected of engaging in the laundering of funds stolen through shady crypto project operations. Following their apprehension, the police seized $350 million (€300,000) in cash, $931,000 (€800,000) in bank accounts, and $483,000 (€415,000) in cryptocurrencies. They also confiscated digital devices and high-value wristwatches from the suspected criminals. As the authorities delved deeper in the case, they realized it had grown beyond a simple fraud scheme into a sophisticated criminal operation. Hence, they carried out the second phase of the investigation, targeting the affiliate marketing infrastructure used by these online scammers. Meanwhile, the authorities have not concluded their operations. They are still conducting thorough investigations into the remaining stolen funds and plan to crack down on other individuals involved in the fraudulent act.

The cryptocurrency market, often driven by sentiment and momentum, is now showing clear bearish signals that demand attention. Recent analysis reveals concerning patterns in both on-chain metrics and broader economic factors that could impact Bitcoin ‘s near-term trajectory. Let’s examine why the market sentiment has turned cautious and what these developments mean for your portfolio. Why Is Bitcoin Showing Bearish Signs Right Now? The current Bitcoin market presents a complex picture where traditional bullish catalysts appear to be losing steam. According to recent analysis, several key metrics have shifted toward a more bearish outlook. The monthly futures premium, a reliable gauge of market sentiment, has dropped below the neutral 5% threshold. This decline suggests that institutional traders are becoming less optimistic about Bitcoin ‘s immediate price prospects. Moreover, the options market tells an even clearer story—put options now carry a significant premium, indicating heightened demand for downside protection. What Do On-Chain Metrics Reveal About BTC’s Health? On-chain analysis provides crucial insights into Bitcoin ‘s fundamental strength, and current data points to concerning trends. The lack of substantial inflows into spot Bitcoin ETFs represents a significant shift from earlier this year when these products drove substantial buying pressure. Additionally, network activity and transaction volumes have shown patterns consistent with previous bearish phases. Key indicators to watch include: Futures premium below neutral levels – signaling reduced institutional optimism Elevated put option costs – indicating increased hedging against declines Reduced ETF inflows – showing diminished institutional participation Exchange outflow patterns – suggesting changing holder behavior How Are Macroeconomic Factors Impacting Bitcoin? The broader economic landscape plays a crucial role in cryptocurrency markets, and current conditions are creating headwinds for Bitcoin . The declining probability of Federal Reserve interest rate cuts removes a potential catalyst that many investors had anticipated. Higher interest rates typically reduce risk appetite across financial markets, including cryptocurrencies. Furthermore, the slump in the U.S. real estate market signals potential economic stress that could affect investor confidence. These macro factors combine to create a challenging environment for risk assets like Bitcoin . What Does the Options Market Tell Us About Sentiment? The derivatives market offers valuable insights into trader expectations, and current data reveals a distinctly bearish tilt. On Deribit, one of the largest crypto options exchanges, BTC put options are trading at a 13% premium compared to call options. This premium indicates that traders are willing to pay more for protection against price declines—a classic characteristic of bearish market conditions. The options skew, which measures the relative cost of puts versus calls, has shifted significantly toward puts, suggesting that professional traders are positioning for potential downside. Can Bitcoin Overcome These Bearish Headwinds? While the current indicators appear bearish , cryptocurrency markets have historically demonstrated remarkable resilience. However, overcoming these challenges requires monitoring several key developments. The return of sustained ETF inflows could provide necessary buying pressure, while any shift in Federal Reserve policy could improve risk sentiment. Additionally, Bitcoin ‘s upcoming halving event in 2024 remains a fundamental bullish factor that could eventually outweigh short-term bearish signals. Investors should watch for: Institutional adoption trends – particularly through regulated products Regulatory developments – that could improve market structure Network growth metrics – indicating fundamental adoption Macroeconomic policy shifts – that could improve risk appetite The current Bitcoin market presents a cautionary tale for investors. Multiple indicators from both on-chain data and macroeconomic analysis point to a bearish outlook that demands careful attention. While the cryptocurrency has weathered similar periods before, the convergence of negative signals across derivatives markets, ETF flows, and economic conditions suggests a period of heightened risk. Savvy investors should maintain a balanced perspective, recognizing both the challenges and the long-term potential of Bitcoin as a transformative asset class. Frequently Asked Questions What does ‘bearish’ mean for Bitcoin? ‘Bearish’ describes a market outlook where prices are expected to decline. For Bitcoin, this means indicators suggest the cryptocurrency may face downward pressure in the near term. How reliable are futures premiums as indicators? Futures premiums are generally reliable sentiment indicators because they reflect institutional expectations. When premiums drop below neutral levels, it suggests professional traders are less optimistic about immediate price appreciation. Why do put option premiums matter? Put options give holders the right to sell at a specific price. When these options trade at higher premiums than call options, it indicates increased demand for downside protection—a bearish signal. Can Bitcoin ETFs reverse bearish trends? Yes, sustained inflows into spot Bitcoin ETFs can provide significant buying pressure that could counteract bearish signals. However, current data shows diminished institutional participation through these vehicles. How long do bearish phases typically last in crypto? Bearish phases in cryptocurrency markets can vary significantly, from several weeks to multiple months. The duration depends on multiple factors including market structure, adoption trends, and macroeconomic conditions. Should I sell my Bitcoin during bearish periods? Investment decisions should align with your individual strategy and risk tolerance. Some investors use bearish periods to accumulate at lower prices, while others may reduce exposure.

But when sentiment hits extremes like this, it often signals the opposite of what traders expect and could favor a bullish XRP price prediction . Santiment data shows social sentiment has plunged into “Extreme Fear,” while CoinMarketCap’s Fear and Greed Index dropped to just 16. From Wednesday to Friday, XRP slipped from $2.20 to $2, capping off three days of selling pressure. Yet behind the scenes, investor interest appears to be building. XRP-linked ETFs have now recorded 15 consecutive days of net inflows, according to SoSo Value, totaling nearly $900 million in fresh capital. Combined assets under management for these funds now sit at $861 million, suggesting that both retail and institutional investors are positioning for a rebound. With fear rising and big money flowing in, this could be the early stage of a major reversal. XRP Price Prediction: XRP Is Forming a Bullish Falling Channel Pattern XRP has bounced off the $1.95 support zone and is now forming a series of higher lows, signaling a potential trend reversal. Source: TradingView The next key level to watch is $2.20. A breakout above this resistance, followed by a successful retest, could confirm a bullish reversal pattern and open the door to a rally toward $3+. In the past 24 hours, XRP has gained 3.3%, with trading volume jumping nearly 90%. With momentum building, the token could be positioning itself for a major breakout. As broader crypto sentiment begins to shift, some of the most promising new projects have continued to gain traction. One project in particular is Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) , a presale project building a Solana-powered layer-2 solution for Bitcoin. By combining Bitcoin’s security with Solana’s speed and scalability, $HYPER is creating a new level of utility for Bitcoin, and investors have taken notice, with millions raised so far. Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) Lets Investors Earn Passive Income on BTC Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) was created to address the Bitcoin blockchain’s long-standing scalability issues by introducing a Solana-powered infrastructure that reduces transaction fees and speeds up transaction speeds.

Revisiting Amazon’s Long-Term Growth Pattern The discussion gained momentum after market analyst 24hrscrypto1 referenced the growth of Amazon’s stock price during its early years. He pointed to data showing that Amazon traded at only $0.09 in the late 1990s before gradually rising to more than $229 over an extended period. According to the figures he shared, this represents a cumulative increase exceeding 250,000%. The analyst emphasized that Amazon did not immediately gain widespread recognition and spent many years in periods of slow movement before registering major gains. He argued that this timeline demonstrates how large returns often require sustained patience, especially in sectors that involve new technologies or emerging markets. Everyone crying that “XRP is taking forever” needs to look at this chart and breathe for a second… Amazon was $0.09 in 1997 and nobody cared… Nobody understood it Nobody had the patience People want Amazon level returns… …but with microwave level patience. pic.twitter.com/tcsAsssGZa — 𝟸𝟺𝙷𝚁𝚂𝙲𝚁𝚈𝙿𝚃𝙾 (@24hrscrypto1) December 8, 2025 Growing Concerns Inside the XRP Community The comparison surfaced amid increasing frustration among XRP holders. The asset has experienced slow momentum even as several major developments have unfolded. Ripple allocated $2.5 billion this year toward various initiatives, and XRP-focused exchange-traded funds reportedly accumulated close to $1 billion in their first month of activity. Despite these notable events, XRP’s price has fallen by more than 26% over the past two months. The extended consolidation has led many investors to express concern about XRP’s performance relative to other digital assets. According to 24hrscrypto1, the dissatisfaction reflects a broader trend in which many traders expect substantial gains within short periods but are reluctant to endure lengthy phases of limited price action. He argued that this mindset overlooks how long it can take for underlying technologies to develop and for market participants to fully appreciate their value.

Some commentators stated that the analogy does not hold up when reviewing long-term charts. One user, Mortimer, argued that Amazon’s price history shows steady progression over time, whereas XRP’s chart displays frequent stagnation across multiple years. He contended that the patterns are fundamentally different. In response, 24hrscrypto1 said that the appearance of Amazon’s growth curve is influenced by hindsight. He suggested that looking at Amazon’s early chart without knowledge of its future success would show slow progress similar to what XRP is currently experiencing. He maintained that XRP may still be in the early stages of realizing its potential. Another participant noted that, historically, XRP’s appreciation from its lowest recorded levels to its past highs still reflects strong lifetime gains. Even so, some analysts argue that the asset may have already passed its most significant growth phase. While some community members use Amazon’s history to support optimistic projections for XRP, others cautioned that equating a cryptocurrency with a longstanding corporation can lead to unrealistic assumptions. One critic pointed out that Amazon’s value is linked to a business producing revenue, while XRP functions as a digital asset without the same type of financial foundation. He warned that drawing parallels between the two may encourage misplaced confidence. Disclaimer : This content is meant to inform and should not be considered financial advice.

55523518,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=238787,1765238411,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Hold Bitcoin for Decades: Strategy CEO’s Bold 2065 Commitment Reveals Unwavering Conviction,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/strategy-ceo-hold-bitcoin-2065/,"BitcoinWorld Hold Bitcoin for Decades: Strategy CEO’s Bold 2065 Commitment Reveals Unwavering Conviction In a stunning declaration of long-term faith, Strategy CEO Phong Le has announced the company plans to hold Bitcoin in its treasury for over four decades, with a target date of 2065. This move signals a profound shift in how institutions view digital assets, not as a short-term trade, but as a generational store of value. But what does this mean for everyday investors and the broader crypto market? Why Would a Company Commit to Hold Bitcoin for 40+ Years? During a CNBC interview, Phong Le provided clear reasoning for this unprecedented timeline. He stated that Strategy’s stock remains a crucial vehicle for investors seeking exposure to Bitcoin, even after the introduction of spot Bitcoin ETFs. The decision to hold Bitcoin until at least 2065 is a strategic commitment to this thesis. It transforms Bitcoin from a speculative asset on the balance sheet into a core, long-term strategic holding. This approach communicates unwavering conviction to shareholders and the market. It suggests the company views Bitcoin’s potential maturation and adoption as a multi-decade journey. Therefore, they are insulating their strategy from short-term price volatility and regulatory noise. Strategy Stock vs. Spot Bitcoin ETFs: What’s the Better Play? Le’s comments highlight an interesting dynamic in the investment landscape. With spot ETFs now available, why choose a company stock to gain Bitcoin exposure? Le argues Strategy offers something unique. Active Management: The company can make strategic decisions about buying, holding, or leveraging its Bitcoin position. Additional Value: Investors get exposure to Strategy’s core business and management expertise, not just the crypto asset. Long-Term Alignment: The 2065 pledge aligns management’s incentives with shareholders who believe in Bitcoin’s long-term future. Essentially, buying Strategy stock is a bet on both Bitcoin’s success and the company’s ability to manage that exposure wisely over time. The commitment to hold Bitcoin acts as a powerful anchor for that strategy. What Are the Risks of Such a Long-Term Bitcoin Hold? While bold, this strategy is not without significant challenges. Committing to an asset class as young and evolving as cryptocurrency for 40 years involves inherent risks. Technological Disruption: Could a new technology surpass Bitcoin? Regulatory Uncertainty: Long-term global regulatory frameworks are still undefined. Market Volatility: Extreme price swings could test the resolve of any holder. Execution Risk: The company must maintain its operational strength for decades to uphold this promise. However, by publicly stating its intent, Strategy is betting that these risks are outweighed by the potential reward. The move may encourage other corporations to consider similar long-term crypto strategies. Key Takeaways for Investors from This Bold Move Strategy’s announcement is more than a corporate headline; it’s a case study in conviction. For investors, it underscores several critical points. First, institutional adoption of Bitcoin is moving beyond speculation into strategic allocation. Second, having a clear, long-term plan is crucial when dealing with volatile assets. The decision to hold Bitcoin indefinitely removes the emotion of timing the market. Finally, it highlights the importance of choosing investment vehicles that match your belief in the asset’s timeline. In conclusion, Strategy CEO Phong Le’s pledge to hold Bitcoin until 2065 is a landmark moment of institutional confidence. It frames Bitcoin not as a passing trend, but as a foundational asset for the digital age. This long-term vision could inspire a new wave of corporate treasury strategies and reshape how all investors think about the time horizon for crypto investments. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q: Why 2065? Is that a specific target? A> The year 2065 is likely a symbolic date representing a commitment far beyond typical investment cycles, emphasizing a multi-generational hold rather than a precise target. Q: Does this mean Strategy will never sell any Bitcoin? A> The statement suggests a core, long-term holding strategy. The company may still manage the position tactically, but the intent is to maintain a significant Bitcoin treasury for decades. Q: How does this affect the price of Bitcoin? A> While one company’s strategy doesn’t directly control price, such strong, public conviction from a CEO can boost market sentiment and encourage other institutions to consider similar long-term holds. Q: Should I copy this strategy for my personal portfolio? A> Not necessarily. A corporate treasury strategy differs from personal investing. Always assess your own risk tolerance, timeline, and financial goals. Consider consulting a financial advisor. Q: What happens if Phong Le is no longer CEO? A> This is a key risk. The commitment is tied to current leadership. Future management could change the strategy, though such a public pledge creates expectations for continuity.

The broader crypto landscape remains sharply divided: some analysts argue that ETH and the rest of the market still face downward continuation, potentially setting new local lows, while others believe this correction is simply a reset before a much larger bull cycle—possibly extending into 2026. Related Reading: Bitcoin Must Break $97K To Restore Confidence Among Youngest Long-Term Holders – Details Yet one signal stands out clearly amid the noise: smart whales are unanimously going long on ETH. On-chain data shows that several of the most profitable and consistent whale traders—each with tens of millions in realized gains—have opened substantial long positions, collectively exceeding hundreds of millions of dollars. Their coordinated behavior indicates confidence that Ethereum’s recent lows represent opportunity rather than danger. This alignment among top-performing whales introduces a compelling counterpoint to bearish narratives. While retail sentiment remains fragile, the most sophisticated market participants appear to be positioning for a larger move ahead. As Ethereum stabilizes above $3,150, the question now becomes whether whale conviction will prove to be early—or correct. Top Performers Load Up on Ethereum According to Hyperdash data shared by Lookonchain, some of the most successful and influential whales in the market are aggressively accumulating Ethereum—sending a strong signal that high-conviction players expect upside ahead. One of the most notable is BitcoinOG, the trader widely recognized for shorting the market during the violent 10/10 crash, a move that earned him significant credibility. With a total realized PNL of $105 million, BitcoinOG is now positioned firmly on the bullish side, holding 54,277 ETH worth approximately $169.48 million. Another major player is the well-known Anti-CZ whale, named for his historical pattern of taking the opposite side of positions favored by Binance founder Changpeng Zhao. With an impressive $58.8 million in total PNL, this whale is currently long 62,156 ETH—a massive $194 million position. His trades have often been early indicators of broad market direction, adding weight to this shift toward bullish exposure. Finally, pension-usdt.eth, a consistently profitable whale address with $16.3 million in realized gains, is long 20,000 ETH valued at $62.5 million. Taken together, these positions reflect a unified stance among top-performing whales: despite market uncertainty, they are positioning for Ethereum strength. Related Reading: Ethereum Shows Signs Of Accumulation As CVD Strengthens And Correlation Stays Elevated Weekly Structure Shows Early Signs of Stabilization Ethereum’s weekly chart reveals a market attempting to regain its footing after a sharp multi-week decline from the $4,500 region. The recent reclaim of $3,150 is a meaningful development, as this level aligns closely with prior weekly support from mid-2024 and sits just above the 50-week moving average—an area that often acts as a trend-defining zone. ETH briefly dipped below this region during the November selloff, but buyers stepped in aggressively, producing a strong weekly wick that signals demand at lower levels. Despite this recovery attempt, ETH remains below key resistance levels. The 20-week and 100-week moving averages are positioned above the current price and converging, creating a zone of potential rejection unless momentum strengthens. For now, ETH is trading in a transitional structure: no longer trending downward aggressively, but not yet showing a confirmed bullish reversal on high timeframes. Related Reading: Ethereum NUPL Holds Steady, Signaling Market Balance Amid Volatility Volume patterns also support this interpretation. Selling volume has diminished compared to the capitulation phase, while recent green candles show moderate but steady buying interest—suggesting accumulation rather than full risk-on behavior. If ETH can establish consecutive weekly closes above $3,200–$3,300, the chart opens the door for a retest of the $3,600–$3,800 range. Failure to hold $3,150, however, risks another move toward $2,800 support.

According to the report, XRP is garnering institutional interest and demand on a global scale. While retail traders debate short-term price movements , smart money capital inflows into XRP are surpassing those of almost every other altcoin. XRP Dominates Institutional Inflows Across Europe And The Globe According to an X post by crypto expert Stern Drew, the latest WisdomTree report shows that XRP is the only digital asset attracting consistent institutional demand worldwide. In Europe, XRP has attracted over $549 million in new institutional capital this year, more than three times the inflows into Ethereum. This figure surpasses the total for every altcoin in the market and multi-asset products except Bitcoin. In a continent traditionally known for conservative investment strategies, these flows into XRP represent a decisive vote of confidence from European institutional investors . Drew has revealed that the demand for XRP has also extended beyond Europe. Outside the United States, XRP has captured roughly $252 million in fresh institutional capital just this year. By comparison, Bitcoin products absorbed only $268 million in smart money capital. Given that BTC products are more than 25 times the size of XRP products, this suggests that institutions have directed nearly 25 times more new capital into XRP than into Bitcoin. Drew has suggested that this increase in flows indicates careful, deliberate positioning rather than short-term speculative activity, which highlights the market’s growing preference for XRP . US Adoption Signals Broader Shift In his post, Drew also revealed the growing institutional interest in XRP within the US. This year, a new synthetic XRP product attracted $241 million, surpassing flows into Solana and all other altcoin products in the same category. This surge came at a time when the two largest cryptocurrencies, Bitcoin and Ethereum, collectively saw $6.4 billion exit their ETF structures . Drew revealed that the dramatic outflows from BTC and ETH signaled that institutional investors were diversifying from established assets while selectively accumulating XRP. The WisdomTree report also showed that, excluding Europe and the US, regions such as Asia and other global markets are increasing their exposure to XRP. Surprisingly, this surge in global institutional demand is occurring during periods of market stress rather than euphoric rallies. The XRP price is currently down by more than 15% this year and trading at just $2.1. The cryptocurrency has also been experiencing significant choppy action over the past few months, failing to reclaim former highs above $3. Despite this structural weakness, institutions continue to accumulate XRP in large quantities, indicating a clear bias toward the cryptocurrency. Drew has also revealed that smart money views XRP as a settlement-grade asset , well-suited for integration into the future architecture of regulated digital finance. He highlights that, as global institutional preference increasingly concentrates on XRP, price movements might follow later.",XRP|bitcoin|Ethereum|ripple|solana|Stern Drew|wisdomtree|XRP news|XRP price|XRPUSD|XRPUSDT,EN,0,0,BTC|ETH|MARKET|XRP|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-12-09 00:00:59

The regulator published its proposals on December 8, targeting improvements to how firms interact with experienced clients while simplifying the investment journey for ordinary consumers. The measures form part of efforts to bolster the UK's position as a leading financial hub and encourage greater participation in capital markets. The FCA's framework establishes distinct regulatory pathways for different investor categories. Professional investors will operate outside certain retail regulations, though the threshold for qualification remains deliberately stringent. Only individuals with substantial market experience, access to professional advice, or a genuine capacity to absorb investment losses will qualify for professional status. New Classification System Removes Arbitrary Barriers The current system relies on what regulators describe as arbitrary tests that fail to assess investor sophistication accurately. The revised approach places responsibility directly on firms to verify that clients genuinely meet professional standards before classification. Wealthy and experienced individuals gain access to a streamlined process for opting out of retail protections. Firms must obtain documented informed consent from clients choosing this route. The requirement ensures investors understand the protections they are waiving. Simon Walls, Executive Director of Markets at the FCA, stated that the changes aim to support an investment culture across all investor types. The framework provides retail customers with clearer information while giving professional markets defined boundaries based on contractual agreements and proportionate oversight. Professional investors will no longer face constraints such as the Consumer Duty, a regulation requiring firms to deliver good outcomes for retail clients. The exemption allows more flexible engagement between firms and sophisticated investors who can negotiate terms directly. Simplified Disclosure Requirements for Retail Investors The regulator is overhauling its communications with retail investors. Prescriptive templates inherited from European Union regulations will be replaced with a more flexible approach centered on Consumer Duty principles. Firms will gain freedom to design disclosures that effectively communicate investment risks, costs, and potential returns. The Consumer Composite Investments regime replaces the existing PRIIPs and UCITS frameworks, which consumers have historically found difficult to understand. The FCA has opened a consultation examining how regulation can better facilitate consumer access to investments. The review specifically considers expanding retail investor access to private markets, an asset class that has traditionally been reserved for institutional players. Britain faces challenges in encouraging investment participation. Recent research indicates 55 percent of adults remain unwilling to accept investment risks. This reluctance has significant economic implications. Analysis shows half of British household wealth outside pensions sits in property, while 15 percent of the population holds their savings in cash.

The conflict intensified when OKX announced on December 5 that it would terminate its service and migrate to a new platform by the end of December. MANTRA CEO JP Mullin claimed that the data is inaccurate and turns the process back to front, posing a risk that users will act on timelines that do not match Governance Proposal 26. Governance mismatch and conflicting dates The central issue is OKX’s assertion that the OM migration will occur between December 22 and December 25, 2025. According to MANTRA, the official governance proposal states that migration can only begin after the ERC-20 OM token has been fully deprecated. The deprecation deadline is January 15, 2026. On December 5, 2025, OKX published a statement entitled “OKX to support OM crypto migration”. This statement contained multiple factual errors and misrepresentations not present in official MANTRA governance proposals. We are incredibly concerned by this development, which shows… — JP Mullin (🕉, 🏘️) (@jp_mullin888) December 8, 2025 Proposal 26 also states that the migration date is conditional on the completion of additional technical review and does not assign any December dates to the conversion process. The project also pointed out that OKX had announced several dates in December that were not discussed with MANTRA , including trading services, deposits, withdrawals, and a December 22 snapshot. MANTRA claimed that no dates have been finalized regarding migration and emphasized that since April 13, the exchange has not communicated with the project regarding the specifics of migration. Exchange-imposed suspension schedule The December 5 announcement by OKX details significant changes to how OM trading will work. With OM, borrowing was to close on December 5, and between December 12 and December 19, the OM/USDT margin trading was to be suspended. OM-linked perpetual futures were to be delisted on December 15. Trading bots linked to the affected markets would gradually decrease in activity before each suspension. OM pairs were to be paused in the spot market between December 19 and 22, and OKX said that all deposits, withdrawals and transfers would end at 03:00 UTC on December 22. The user balance record was recorded at the same time, with OKX stating that the migration would continue until December 25. The exchange explained that no accounts with a balance below 10 OM would be converted and that only users with a KYC Level 2 or higher would be able to convert. During the migration period, OKX reported that information regarding OM valuation would be unavailable. MANTRA CEO advises users to retain direct custody Reacting to this, the MANTRA CEO encouraged users to take their OM out of OKX and migrate it through the official project channels as soon as the process becomes accessible. According to MANTRA, this method will ensure that their governance decisions are based on their own timeline, rather than an exchange-issued timeline, which aligns with Proposal 26. The team added that every other big exchange has been aligning their preparations with MANTRA, and that the only exchange to announce dates without liaising with the project was OKX. MANTRA further indicated that it is determined to work with all OM retail holders during the transition and will continue to collaborate with the exchanges to ensure that the migration process is accurate and consistent.

The regulator found X to be in violation of the EU’s digital regulations after a two-year investigation. US officials, including Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Vice President JD Vance, were also critical of the EU, claiming that the decision is an attack on American companies. Why did the EU fine Elon Musk’s company? Elon Musk’s social media platform, X, has been fined £120 million ($140 million) for breaching the European Union’s digital regulations. The Digital Services Act was adopted in 2022 to regulate online platforms, but this is the first time the EU has issued a non-compliance decision under its rules. The fine covers three main violations confirmed during the two-year investigation, including the deceptive design of X’s blue checkmark system, the lack of transparency in its advertising repository, and failure to provide access to public data for researchers. Before Musk acquired X in 2022, the platform was known as Twitter, and blue checkmarks were largely reserved for celebrities, politicians and influential accounts. After the purchase, the site started issuing badges to anyone willing to pay $8 per month. European regulators argue this system makes it difficult for users to judge the authenticity of accounts and exposes them to scams and impersonation fraud. The fine breaks down into £45 million for the blue checkmark issue, £35 million for the advertising repository problems, and £40 million for blocking researchers from accessing public data. X now has 60 days to inform the Commission how it will fix the blue checkmark issues and 90 days to submit plans for fixing its advertising repository and researcher access problems. Failure to comply could lead to additional periodic penalty payments. How are U.S. officials reacting to the fine? The U.S. Secretary of State, Marco Rubio, called the fine an attack on American tech platforms and the American people by foreign governments. Vice President JD Vance accused the Commission of seeking to fine X for not engaging in censorship. Musk initially simply reacted with a post on X saying that the decision was “bullshit.” By Saturday, he had a much bigger reaction, stating that the EU should be abolished and sovereignty should be returned to individual countries so that their governments can better represent the people. U.S. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick recently stated that the EU must revise its digital regulations to secure a deal for reducing its steel and aluminum tariffs. The Trump administration has consistently argued that the EU unfairly targets U.S. technology companies with severe financial penalties and burdensome regulations. The U.S. Ambassador to the EU, Andrew Puzder, said the fine, which was placed not just on X but on Musk himself, is an example of regulatory overreach targeting American innovation. European officials have denied the accusations so far. A Commission spokesman, Thomas Regnier, stated at a press conference that the EU is not targeting anyone based on their country of origin. Regnier also noted that Europe’s preference had not been to fine X. He explained that when companies engage constructively with the Commission, they prefer to settle cases, using TikTok as an example. Meta was recently found in breach of EU competition rules over its pay or consent system earlier this year and was fined £200 million.

Acting Chairman Caroline Pham said the initiative was intended to draw digital-asset activity into U.S.-regulated markets and to get away from using offshore trading platforms. Bitcoin , Ethereum, and USDC will be treated solely as collateral for the first three months. The program establishes guardrails for Futures Commission Merchants (FCMs) accepting digital assets, requiring them to report weekly and receive timely alerts of operational issues. The CFTC also guided the application of tokenized real-world assets, including Treasury securities and money-market funds, under its current regime, with a focus on custody, segregation, valuation, and operational risks, while maintaining technology-neutral regulations. In carrying out the pilot, CFTC suspended Staff Advisory 20-34, a 2020 memo that has excluded FCMs from accepting digital assets as collateral. The agency said advances in tokenization and the GENIUS Act had rendered the advisory obsolete. The GENIUS Act, passed in July, established a federal framework for non-securities digital assets and expanded the CFTC’s authority over both spot crypto markets and tokenized collateral. Coinbase’s chief legal officer, Paul Grewal, backed such a change, identifying the 2020 advisory as a “concrete ceiling on innovation” that went beyond regulatory limits and irritated the President’s Working Group on Digital Asset Markets. U.S. derivatives markets set to welcome institutional crypto activity The CFTC’s pilot program could have a ripple effect on the U.S. cryptocurrency market. Allowing tokenized assets, such as Bitcoin, Ethereum, and USDC, to serve as margin collateral may help increase the liquidity of derivatives markets and attract new institutional investors who currently avoid U.S.-regulated platforms due to stringent regulations. Improved inclusion by these investors may lead to reduced dependence on offshore exchanges, thereby increasing the number of trades and the capital raised under U.S. regulatory oversight. Analysts suggest that adding tokenized collateral could also stabilize the market through standardized reporting and operational safeguards – something that could help mitigate the kind of volatility seen in the digital asset space. The pilot also indicates regulators are starting to come to terms with digital financial innovation, setting the stage for more crypto firms to do business in the U.S. rather than overseas. Broadly speaking, the program represents a significant step toward bridging the gap between traditional finance and digital asset markets. Spot crypto trading debuts on CFTC-registered exchanges The pilot is a few days after the CFTC approved spot crypto trading on CFTC-registered exchanges for the first time, a step Pham called unprecedented. Bitnomial exchange in Chicago, which is regulated as a derivatives venue, is now scheduled to launch leveraged spot trading, with its existing futures and options products, this week. The U.S. derivatives watchdog regulates the exchange as a designated contract market (DCM). This means that the new activity will be launching in a fully regulated space, following strong encouragement from the federal agency, including direct meetings with Acting Chairman Caroline Pham to help expedite the process during the prolonged federal government shutdown. “Recent events on offshore exchanges have shown us how essential it is for Americans to have more choice and access to safe, regulated U.S. markets,” Pham said in a statement. “Now, for the first time ever, spot crypto can trade on CFTC-registered exchanges that have been the gold standard for nearly a hundred years, with the customer protections and market integrity that Americans deserve.” The step, which Pham referred to as a “historic milestone,” tracks recommendations from the President’s Working Group on Digital Asset Markets, which issued a report this year outlining a crypto agenda for U.S. regulators. Pham noted the CFTC is “finally using our decades-long existing authority” to initiate this trading. Don’t just read crypto news. Understand it. Subscribe to our newsletter.

The Crypto Fear & Greed Index has frozen at a reading of 22, firmly planting the market in ‘extreme fear’ territory. This crucial sentiment gauge, a favorite among traders and analysts, suggests investor anxiety is running high. But what does this persistent fear actually signal, and more importantly, how should you navigate it? Let’s break down the numbers and the psychology behind them. What is the Crypto Fear & Greed Index Telling Us Right Now? The Crypto Fear & Greed Index is more than just a number. Compiled by Alternative.me, it acts as the market’s emotional pulse check. A score of 22, unchanged from the previous day, is a clear signal. The scale runs from 0 (extreme fear) to 100 (extreme greed). Therefore, hovering just above 20 indicates a market gripped by significant pessimism and caution. This isn’t a fleeting moment of doubt; it’s a sustained state of worry that influences trading decisions across the board. How is the Fear & Greed Index Calculated? This index doesn’t rely on gut feeling. It uses a data-driven formula to quantify the market’s mood. Understanding its components helps explain why the reading is so low: Volatility (25%): Sharp price swings, especially downward, increase fear. Market Volume (25%): High sell-off volume versus buying volume points to panic. Social Media (15%): The tone of conversations on platforms like Twitter and Reddit. Surveys (15%): Direct sentiment polls from the community. Bitcoin Dominance (10%): A shift to Bitcoin can signal a ‘flight to safety’. Google Trends (10%): Search volume for negative or positive terms. The current Crypto Fear & Greed Index score suggests these factors are collectively painting a bleak picture. Is Extreme Fear a Bad Sign or a Hidden Opportunity? This is the critical question for every investor. Historically, the Crypto Fear & Greed Index has been a powerful contrarian indicator. Periods of ‘extreme fear’ have often preceded major market bottoms and buying opportunities. Why? Because when everyone is selling in panic, assets can become undervalued. However, ‘extreme fear’ can also precede further declines if the underlying market issues are severe. The key is to differentiate between irrational panic and justified caution based on fundamental problems. Actionable Insights for Trading in a Fearful Market Navigating a market with a low Crypto Fear & Greed Index requires a cool head and a clear strategy. Here are some steps to consider: Do Not Panic Sell: Selling at the peak of fear often locks in losses. Review Your Portfolio: Assess which assets have strong fundamentals versus those driven purely by hype. Consider Dollar-Cost Averaging (DCA): This strategy involves buying fixed amounts at regular intervals, which can be effective in volatile, fearful markets. Set Clear Limits: Define your risk tolerance and set stop-loss orders if necessary to manage downside. Use the Index as a Gauge, Not a Gospel: It’s one tool among many. Combine it with technical and fundamental analysis. The Psychological Battle: Mastering Your Own Fear & Greed The most important chart isn’t on your screen; it’s in your mind. A low Crypto Fear & Greed Index often triggers our own worst instincts—the urge to follow the herd off a cliff. Successful investors learn to recognize these emotional triggers. They understand that market sentiment is cyclical. The extreme fear of today will eventually give way to optimism, and later, potentially to extreme greed. Your goal is not to time these cycles perfectly but to avoid making catastrophic decisions at the emotional extremes. In conclusion, the Crypto Fear & Greed Index holding at 22 is a stark reminder of the market’s current nervous disposition. It reflects real data from volatility, volume, and social sentiment. While it signals caution, history teaches us that such pervasive fear can also seed the next opportunity. The wisest approach is to stay informed, stick to your long-term strategy, and remember that in the chaotic world of crypto, sometimes the best move is to simply not make a move driven by panic. Use this period of fear to conduct thorough research and prepare for the market’s next phase. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q: What does a Crypto Fear & Greed Index score of 22 mean?

Have you noticed subtle shifts in the cryptocurrency market lately? The latest data reveals a fascinating development: the Altcoin Season Index has edged up to 19. This single-point movement might seem small, but for seasoned traders, it represents a potential early signal of changing market dynamics. Let’s explore what this means for your portfolio and whether we’re witnessing the beginning of a broader trend. What Exactly Is the Altcoin Season Index? CoinMarketCap’s Altcoin Season Index serves as a crucial market health indicator. The calculation is straightforward yet powerful: it compares the price performance of the top 100 cryptocurrencies (excluding stablecoins and wrapped coins) against Bitcoin over a 90-day period. When 75% of these altcoins outperform Bitcoin during this window, the market officially enters an “altcoin season.” Think of it as a market thermometer. A score closer to 100 indicates strong altcoin dominance, while lower scores suggest Bitcoin is leading the charge. The current reading of 19 represents a one-point increase from the previous day, moving the needle slightly toward potential altcoin strength. Why Should You Care About This Movement? Even a modest shift in the Altcoin Season Index matters because it reflects changing investor sentiment and capital flows. Here’s what this movement potentially signals: Early Rotation Signs: Money might be starting to flow from Bitcoin into alternative cryptocurrencies Risk Appetite Change: Investors could be becoming more comfortable with altcoin volatility Market Diversification: The crypto ecosystem may be broadening beyond Bitcoin dominance However, remember that we’re still far from the 75 threshold that defines a true altcoin season. This movement represents early-stage interest rather than confirmed trend reversal. How Does This Compare to Previous Market Cycles? Historical context helps us understand the significance of the current Altcoin Season Index reading. During major altcoin seasons, the index has consistently remained above 75 for extended periods. The current level of 19 indicates we’re in what many analysts call a “Bitcoin season” or transition phase. Previous cycles show that sustained movement above 50 often precedes stronger altcoin performance. Therefore, while the current reading remains low, the upward direction bears watching. The key question becomes: will this momentum continue, or is it just temporary market noise? What Actionable Insights Can You Take Away? Monitoring the Altcoin Season Index provides valuable information for your investment strategy. Here are practical ways to use this data: Watch for Consistency: Look for sustained upward movement rather than one-day spikes Combine with Other Indicators: Use the index alongside trading volume and market sentiment data Set Alert Levels: Consider establishing watch points at key levels like 25, 50, and 75 Review Your Portfolio: Assess whether your current allocation matches market conditions Remember that no single indicator should dictate your entire strategy. The Altcoin Season Index works best when combined with fundamental analysis and risk management principles. What’s the Current Market Reality? Despite the slight increase in the Altcoin Season Index , Bitcoin continues to dominate market conversations and capital. The cryptocurrency landscape remains heavily influenced by Bitcoin’s price movements and institutional adoption news. Many altcoins still move in correlation with Bitcoin, though decoupling events become more frequent as the index rises. The journey from 19 to 75 represents significant market evolution. It requires sustained altcoin outperformance across multiple sectors and projects. While some individual altcoins may shine, true season declaration demands broad-based strength. Conclusion: Reading Between the Numbers The Altcoin Season Index movement to 19 offers a glimpse into potential market evolution. While far from signaling a full altcoin season, this upward tick suggests increasing attention toward alternative cryptocurrencies. Savvy investors will monitor this trend while maintaining balanced perspectives on both Bitcoin and altcoin opportunities. The cryptocurrency market thrives on rotation and innovation. Today’s slight index movement could be tomorrow’s significant trend. Stay informed, stay diversified, and remember that understanding indicators like the Altcoin Season Index helps you navigate market transitions with greater confidence. Frequently Asked Questions What does an Altcoin Season Index of 19 mean? An index reading of 19 means that only a small percentage of top altcoins have outperformed Bitcoin over the past 90 days. We remain firmly in Bitcoin-dominant territory, though the upward movement suggests potential early interest in altcoins. How often does the Altcoin Season Index update? The index updates daily, providing regular snapshots of market rotation between Bitcoin and altcoins. This frequency helps traders spot emerging trends more quickly. Can the Altcoin Season Index predict price movements? While not a direct price predictor, the index reflects market sentiment and capital flows. Sustained movements often correlate with broader market trends, making it a valuable sentiment indicator. What happens when the index reaches 75? When the index sustains a reading of 75 or higher, it signals an official “altcoin season.” This means at least 75% of top altcoins have outperformed Bitcoin over the previous 90-day period. Should I buy altcoins when the index rises? Index movements should inform but not dictate investment decisions. Consider the index as one data point among many, and always conduct thorough research before making investment choices. How reliable is the Altcoin Season Index? The index has proven historically reliable for identifying market phases. However, like all indicators, it works best when combined with other analysis methods and should not be used in isolation.

As the development progress gets significant revisions and as the distribution of funds tightens, it can be considered that Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is getting into the spotlight of the conversation regarding being one of the most popular top cryptos below $0.05. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is developing a decentralized lending platform that will have a Peer to Contract and a Peer to Peers environment. Users in the P2C model are lending out assets like ETH or USDT and obtain mtTokens. Such mtTokens increase in value with the payment of interest by borrowers. With borrowing in the P2P environment, the interest rates vary with liquidity, the loan to value policies regulate the safe borrowing habits. Liquidation can be done in case the collateral is overly low. Liquidators cover some amount of debt and seize discounted collateral. Such an orderly structure is a strong contrast to the 2021 rise of SHIB, based on the sentiment, social trends and speculation. Mutuum Finance is also being characterized as a utility new crypto, and some investors think that this puts it in a better position to outperform meme assets over the long-term. Presale Growth, Metrics and Early Price Action Mutuum Finance started off in early 2025 at the price of $0.01. The token is currently trading at $0.035, which is 250% up in development. The project has also attracted more than 18,400 holders with a value of $19.2M. Over 810M MUTM tokens were already sold. The total token supply is 4B. Of these 1.82B tokens, which is equivalent to 45.5% are being allocated towards presale phases. Phase 6 has now penetrated beyond 95%, and there is only a small number of tokens at the present price. The official listing price is $0.06 which has also contributed towards accelerating participation since the distance between the two prices becomes difficult to overlook. Mutuum Finance also has a 24 hour leaderboard where the best user wins $500 worth of MUTM every day. This has contributed to continuous day-to-day interaction and presence in various parts of the world. Onboarding has also been made easy thanks to card payment access, not to mention that it has made it easy to participate in DeFi even among new participants. V1 Schedule, Security Stack and Analyst Expectations On its official X account, Mutuum Finance has confirmed that the V1 testnet will be deployed in Q4 2025. V1 will bring the lending pool, the mtTokens, the liquidation instruments and the debt-tracking module. Launched with support of ETH and USDT. This is the next milestone that is likely to attract new users with the protocol nearing operation into live mode. The role of security work has also contributed significantly to the establishment of trust on the project. Mutuum Finance has also been CertiK audited (Score: 90/100) on the Token Scan. Halborn Security is making checks on the lending contracts to ascertain that they are behaving per the actual circumstances. There is also a $50,000 bug bounty that runs the project, in order to fix the issues before the release of V1. The initial growth models emphasize that protocol-related yield, repurchase and scalability lending mechanisms can result in the token outperforming regular meme-based assets. A number of analyst forecasts currently place MUTM in a 5x to 7x band following V1 activation should there be an increase in borrowing demand. Layer-2 Scaling Mutuum Finance will establish a USD-pegged interest-backed stablecoin, according to the official roadmap. Stablecoins commonly become integrated in the lending ecosystem since it can ensure predictable borrowing and amplify liquidity. This acquisition should contribute towards the growth of the platform. The project will also be deployed in a variety of layer-2 networks. L2 support is accompanied by reduced fees and increased coverage and this is quite critical in the lending markets where collateral updates, interest and liquidation updates are frequent. L2 activities can also spur growth and reinforce greater liquidity. Chainlink feeds will be used as the primary oracle layer in the protocol. Other inputs on pricing will avoid the errors of liquidation. Precise pricing belongs to the most significant aspects of the lending platforms, which is why this arrangement is critical towards long-term viability. With such features put together, certain long term models have depicted a possibility of 800% upside potential over the next crypto cycles. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has surged 250%, raised 19.2M, higher than 18,400 holders and about to complete Phase 6 with an allotment of above 95%. Since V1 is planned to be activated in Q4, audited contracts, mtToken yield, buy pressure, stablecoin development, oracle protection and layer-2 planning, the project is accelerating much more rapidly than many pre-staged tokens.

55525093,642048,1765242043,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/55525093.jpeg,Crypto Community Reacts as U.S. Strategy Push AI While Leaving Digital Assets Undefined,https://bitcoinist.com/crypto-community-reacts-as-u-s-strategy-push-ai/,"The United States’ new national security strategy has renewed debate across the crypto community after omitting any direct reference to digital assets or blockchain technology. Released by the Trump administration, the document outlines the nation’s long-term security priorities and technological ambitions, yet its silence on crypto stands in contrast with both market momentum and recent political statements. As global financial systems increasingly integrate digital assets, many observers see the absence as a signal of policy uncertainty at a time when regulatory clarity is becoming more important for industry growth. Why Has AI Taken the Spotlight Across its 33 pages , the strategy places artificial intelligence, biotechnology, and quantum computing at the center of America’s next-generation competition. The administration states that U.S. technology and standards must “drive the world forward,” underscoring a focus on advanced computing rather than decentralized finance. Digital assets, which had gained prominence through previous remarks from officials, receive no explicit mention. This stands at odds with comments from President Trump in recent months. In a CBS 60 Minutes interview, he warned that China should not become the global leader in virtual assets and insisted that Bitcoin mining should remain within U.S. borders. A Subtle Reference, but No Clear Policy While crypto is not named in the strategy, the document does reference strengthening American “leadership in digital finance and innovation.” Analysts view this as a broad gesture rather than a firm policy direction, but it leaves open the possibility that digital assets may still influence future regulatory or economic strategies. This ambiguity comes despite a year of significant pro-crypto actions. Measures such as the GENIUS Act for stablecoin oversight , the formation of a crypto enforcement task force, reduced regulatory pressures on exchanges, and opposition to a central bank digital currency have all shaped expectations. The establishment of a national Bitcoin reserve, funded through forfeited digital assets, further signals that crypto remains a strategic consideration even if not formally acknowledged in the latest blueprint. Market Response and Broader Implications Currently trading around $91,900, Bitcoin briefly fell below $90,000 following the release of the strategy, a move compounded by broader macroeconomic pressures and anticipation of a Federal Reserve rate decision. The administration’s call for increased defense spending among NATO allies has also raised questions about inflation and monetary policy, factors that could influence investor appetite for digital assets. For now, the omission leaves the industry navigating a familiar gap of strong political rhetoric, scattered policy initiatives, but no comprehensive framework. As the U.S. centers its priorities around AI and quantum computing, crypto’s position in national strategy remains undefined. Is this the end of the ‘Crypto Administration’?

The mix of heavy buying by public firms and signs of miner strain is drawing attention from both bulls and bears. Related Reading: Bitcoin Adoption Is Just Getting Started — 200x Growth Possible, Tom Lee Says Saylor’s Tracker Signals According to a StrategyTracker chart shared by Michael Saylor, Strategy holds about 650,000 BTC with a portfolio value near $58 billion. The chart lists an average purchase price of $74,436 and shows 88 confirmed buy events over time. Saylor captioned the image “Back to Orange Dots?” — a short, familiar cue that has often come before a new accumulation round. Strategy’s most recent reported move was a 130 BTC buy, which fits the company’s long habit of adding during periods of market fear. That pattern matters because when an entity repeatedly buys through downswings, it shapes how other investors react. ₿ack to Orange Dots? pic.twitter.com/npB0NWSZ52 — Michael Saylor (@saylor) December 7, 2025 Corporate Buying Continues Based on reports from BitcoinTreasuries.NET, the top 100 public firms now hold about 1,059,453 BTC combined. ABTC reportedly added 363 BTC, the largest increase this week, while Cango Inc. purchased 130.6 BTC. Other names cited in recent filings include Bitdeer, BitFuFu, Hyperscale Data, Genius Group, and Bitcoin Hodl Co. These moves show that some companies keep expanding reserves even when prices wobble. For market watchers, steady corporate accumulation can be a calming force, though it does not erase broader sell pressure. On-Chain Stress Indicators According to Glassnode charts shared by the Bitcoin Archive, the Hash Ribbon has shifted bearish again, a sign that some miners are facing stress or even pausing operations. Short-Term Holder NUPL has fallen below zero, meaning many recent buyers are holding coins at a loss. Historically, episodes where miners are squeezed at the same time new holders are underwater have appeared near significant lows. That outcome is not certain, but the combination of technical miner strain and unrealized losses among short-term wallets is the kind of setup traders watch closely.

Some expect that corporate purchases and purchases by Strategy could blunt downside and spark a rebound. Others remain cautious because on-chain indicators point to real strain. Market action around major events, like central bank announcements, has also shown Bitcoin can stall before policy moves and then move sharply after.

With negotiations stalled and key disagreements unresolved, the future of a clear legal framework for cryptocurrencies in the United States hangs in the balance. This deadlock creates immense uncertainty for businesses and investors alike. Why Has Crypto Regulation Stalled in Congress? According to Senator Moreno, speaking at a Blockchain Association policy summit, the path to a bipartisan crypto regulation bill is currently blocked by fundamental disagreements. While the U.S. managed to pass the narrower GENIUS Act for stablecoins last summer, efforts for a broader, more comprehensive law have ground to a halt. The senator emphasized a firm stance, stating he would rather have no agreement than a bad one, refusing to include problematic provisions just for the sake of passing a bill. The core issues causing this impasse are not simple. They strike at the heart of how the U.S. government views and manages digital assets. The lack of progress leaves a regulatory gray area that many argue stifles innovation and fails to protect consumers. The Major Roadblocks to Agreement So, what are the specific hurdles preventing a deal on crypto regulation ? The negotiations have stumbled over two primary, and deeply complex, challenges: The SEC vs. CFTC Turf War: A major sticking point is defining the jurisdictional boundaries between the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC). Lawmakers must decide which agency gets primary oversight over different types of digital assets—a decision with huge implications for the industry. Consumer Protection Provisions: Crafting rules that adequately protect investors from fraud and market manipulation without being so restrictive that they crush legitimate innovation is a delicate balancing act. Agreeing on the specifics of these provisions has proven difficult. These are not minor technical details. They are foundational questions that will shape the U.S. crypto landscape for decades. Resolving them requires compromise from both political parties and regulatory bodies with sometimes competing philosophies. What’s Next for US Crypto Policy? Despite the current stalemate, the conversation is not over. Republicans and Democrats are scheduled to meet again to continue discussions. The question remains: can they bridge the gap? The outcome of these talks will determine whether the U.S. embraces a leadership role in the digital economy or continues with a patchwork of state rules and aggressive enforcement actions. The delay in federal crypto regulation has real-world consequences. It creates uncertainty for companies deciding where to base their operations and leaves everyday investors without clear protections. Many industry advocates warn that the United States risks falling behind other nations that are moving more swiftly to establish clear rules. The Final Verdict on the Regulatory Impasse The admission by Senator Moreno that crypto regulation talks have stalled is a pivotal moment. It highlights the profound challenges of governing a fast-evolving technological frontier with traditional political and regulatory tools. While the desire for a “no bad deal” is principled, the ongoing vacuum carries its own risks. The coming weeks will be critical as lawmakers reconvene, facing pressure from both an eager industry and a concerned public to find a viable path forward. The dream of comprehensive, clear crypto regulation remains alive, but its path through Congress is now fraught with significant obstacles. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What did Senator Bernie Moreno say about crypto regulation? A1: Senator Moreno stated that negotiations for a comprehensive crypto regulation bill in Congress have stalled due to key disagreements, primarily over SEC/CFTC jurisdiction and consumer protection rules. He expressed a preference for no deal over a bad one. Q2: What is the GENIUS Act? A2: The GENIUS Act is a U.S. law passed in the summer of 2023 that specifically regulates stablecoins—a type of cryptocurrency pegged to a stable asset like the U.S. dollar. The current stalled talks concern a much broader regulatory framework. Q3: Why is defining SEC vs. CFTC jurisdiction so important? A3: It’s crucial because the SEC regulates securities (investments), while the CFTC regulates commodities (like goods and futures). How a cryptocurrency is classified determines which rules apply, impacting everything from trading to disclosure requirements for companies. Q4: What happens if Congress can’t agree on crypto regulation? A4: Without federal legislation, the current state of regulatory uncertainty continues. This likely means more enforcement actions by the SEC and CFTC based on existing laws, a patchwork of state-level regulations, and continued legal ambiguity for businesses and investors. Q5: Are there any upcoming meetings about this? A5: Yes. According to reports, Republicans and Democrats in Congress are scheduled to meet on December 9th to continue discussions on the stalled crypto regulation bill. Q6: How does this stalemate affect the average crypto user? A6: It prolongs uncertainty. Users may face unclear tax reporting guidelines, inconsistent protections across different platforms, and a U.S. crypto industry that is hesitant to innovate or offer new services due to the lack of regulatory clarity.

This action sends a stark warning to the project and its investors, emphasizing that compliance and transparency are non-negotiable in today’s crypto landscape. The MASA delisting watchlist placement is not a final verdict but a critical probation period that could determine the token’s future on a major trading platform. Why Did Coinone Place MASA on the Delisting Watchlist? Coinone’s decision stems from a series of unresolved issues that raised red flags for the exchange’s compliance team. The primary reasons for the MASA delisting watchlist action are clear and focused on investor protection. The exchange stated it will monitor the project for approximately one month to verify if these significant concerns are adequately addressed. The core issues cited by Coinone include: Incomplete Security Follow-Up: Evidence suggests that corrective measures from a past security incident have not been fully implemented, leaving potential vulnerabilities unpatched. Opaque Governance: A lack of transparency and rationality in the project’s procedures for making major changes, leaving the community in the dark about key decisions. Insufficient Disclosure: Failure to properly disclose important matters to investors and the exchange, violating fundamental principles of trust and communication. What Does a Delisting Watchlist Mean for MASA Holders? For current investors, the MASA delisting watchlist status creates immediate uncertainty. However, it is crucial to understand the process. A watchlist is a precursor to potential delisting, not the event itself. This period is a final chance for the MASA project team to demonstrate concrete improvements and satisfy Coinone’s requirements. During this watch period, trading of MASA on Coinone typically continues. However, the announcement often triggers market volatility. Investors should monitor official communications from both Coinone and the MASA project team closely. The key question is: Can the MASA team provide verifiable proof that they have resolved the cited issues within the given timeframe? How Can the MASA Project Respond to This Warning? The path forward for MASA is challenging but defined. To avoid a full delisting, the project leadership must take swift, transparent, and verifiable action. First, they must publicly address each of Coinone’s concerns with detailed plans and evidence. Second, they need to enhance their communication channels, ensuring all stakeholders are informed about significant changes. Finally, implementing and documenting robust security protocols is non-negotiable. This situation serves as a powerful case study for other crypto projects. Exchanges like Coinone are increasingly acting as gatekeepers, enforcing standards that protect users. The era of operating without clear governance and security is rapidly closing. Projects that prioritize these elements will build stronger, more resilient communities. Key Takeaways from the MASA Delisting Watchlist Announcement Coinone’s action reinforces several critical lessons for the broader cryptocurrency market. It highlights the growing importance of exchange oversight in an industry maturing beyond its wild west phase. For investors, it underscores the necessity of due diligence, looking beyond price charts to assess a project’s operational integrity and compliance posture. The MASA delisting watchlist event is ultimately a story about accountability. Whether MASA survives this probation period will depend entirely on its team’s ability to deliver transparency and security—the very foundations of trust in decentralized finance. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) What is a delisting watchlist? A delisting watchlist is a probationary status where an exchange flags a cryptocurrency for potential removal due to compliance, security, or operational issues. The project is given a set period to address these concerns before a final delisting decision is made. Can I still trade MASA on Coinone during the watchlist period? Yes, trading usually continues during the watchlist period unless Coinone issues a specific trading suspension notice. However, investors should be aware of potentially high volatility and monitor official announcements. How long will MASA be on the watchlist? Coinone stated the watch period will last “about a month.” The exact timeline should be confirmed via Coinone’s official公告. What happens if MASA gets delisted from Coinone? If delisted, MASA trading pairs would be removed from Coinone. Investors would need to withdraw their MASA tokens to a private wallet or another supporting exchange before the withdrawal deadline closes. Does this affect MASA trading on other exchanges? Not directly. Coinone’s decision is specific to its platform. However, other exchanges may review their own listings based on the issues Coinone identified, making this a pivotal moment for the project’s reputation. What should MASA holders do now? Holders should closely follow official updates from both Coinone and the MASA project team. Assess the project’s response to the cited issues and make informed decisions based on the transparency and speed of their corrective actions.

Final 90K Tokens Left While ETH Futures Buzz Grows and XRP Shows Strategic Momentum,https://timestabloid.com/could-bullzilla-be-the-next-100x-crypto-final-90k-tokens-left/,"Crypto never stays quiet, it sprints in like someone yelling, “Who touched my bags?!” Markets are buzzing again as major networks announce upgrades, trading floors heat up, and new contenders roar into view. Ethereum climbs on innovation-driven confidence. XRP reminds investors how volatility can become a strategy. And overshadowing the meme galaxy is BullZilla, smashing presale milestones and rewriting what early-stage momentum looks like. BullZilla rises with a cinematic storyline, disciplined tokenomics, and a scarcity engine that’s tightening by the day. With less than 90K tokens left, investors are racing to catch the final allocation. The project positions itself as a standout challenger for the next 100x crypto title, powered by a community that grows louder with every stage progression. BullZilla Presale at a glance Stage: Stage 13 (Zilla Sideways Smash) Phase: 3 Current Price: 0.00033905 Presale Tally: Over $1M+ Raised Token Holders: Over 3700 Tokens Sold: Over 32 B Current ROI: ($1,454.75% ) from Stage 13C to the Listing Price of $0.00527 ROI until Stage 13C for the Earliest Joiners: $5,796.52% $1000 Investment =2.949 million $BZIL Tokens Upcoming Price Surge = 1.96% increase in 13D from 0.00033905 to 0.00034572 BullZilla Stage 13C Delivers 1,454% ROI: And Stage 13D Adds Another 1.96% Soon BullZilla ($BZIL): The Next 100x Crypto Contender Smashing Into the Market BullZilla delivers the next 100x crypto energy instantly, blending a mythical lore universe with one of the most polished meme-brand identities in the space. The Zilla DNA storyline, multidimensional battles, and lore-based culture make the project feel alive,giving holders emotional investment beyond just price action. Community-driven branding becomes rocket fuel for visibility and on-chain traction. The tokenomics deepen that appeal. BullZilla’s deflationary framework gradually reduces available supply, reinforced by a recent burn of 666,666 BZIL tokens,a standalone scarcity boost not linked to presale stages. Combined with predictable price increases every 48 hours or every $100K raised, the supply curve tightens as demand accelerates. With Stage 13C nearing its cap, scarcity-driven pressure continues to rise. How a $5,000 Shot Turns Into a Zilla-Sized Bag (With Post-Listing Value) A $5,000 entry at the Stage 13C price of $0.000339050 secures roughly 14.745 million BZIL tokens, valued at about $77,700 at the confirmed listing price of $0.00527,a massive built-in upside before trading even begins. After listing, BullZilla’s burn mechanics, presale momentum, and narrative-powered brand strength could amplify that value further as liquidity builds. It’s like snagging Avalanche before the training wheels came off,except this time, the mascot breathes fire. How to Join BullZilla Presale Before the Next Price Jump Head to the official BullZilla presale dashboard, connect a wallet, choose a payment token, and secure BZIL before Stage 13C sells out, with fewer than 90K tokens remaining. A 10% bonus is available on $50+ purchases with a referral code, plus 10% referral earnings from friends’ buys. Rewards unlock two weeks after purchase. Stage 13D activates soon with a 1.96% price increase, and every new stage automatically raises the BullZilla price as funds enter or time expires. Ethereum ($ETH): Vitalik’s Gas Futures Proposal Ignites Market Momentum Ethereum climbed 2.96% to $3,137.59 in 24 hours following Vitalik Buterin’s push for an on-chain, trustless gas futures market. This proposal introduces a forward-pricing mechanism for block space, enabling users to lock in future gas rates and hedge against volatility, even when fees are currently low. The concept aims to improve cost predictability for developers and heavy network users. Industry analysts view this as a structural evolution rather than an experimental idea. A BASEFEE futures market could become a key element of Ethereum’s long-term infrastructure, strengthening its role as the settlement layer for global on-chain activity. Traders watching Ethereum price today see this development as a strong foundational catalyst for future demand. XRP ($XRP): Price Up 1.43% as Volatility Insights Reshape Investor Strategy XRP increased 1.43% to $2.08 over the past 24 hours as analysts revisited its historical volatility patterns. XRP’s sharp surges and sudden pullbacks continue to serve as a case study for risk-aware investors. Lessons such as dollar-cost averaging, stop-loss planning, take-profit automation, and sentiment tracking remain central themes in its price behavior analysis. Regulatory developments still influence XRP heavily, prompting traders to adjust strategies quickly. These insights now align with broader discussions around modeling tools such as Cardano price prediction and extended Cardano 2025 price frameworks. XRP’s chart remains a valuable resource for understanding real-time market reactions. Conclusion Crypto markets show renewed strength as Ethereum pushes structural innovation and XRP delivers clarity through volatility analysis. These developments increase momentum behind opportunities in the next 100x crypto sector, where early positioning becomes crucial. BullZilla leads that conversation. With over $1M raised, 3,700+ holders, 32B+ tokens sold, and an ROI of 1,454.75% from Stage 13C to listing, the project is hitting major milestones. Less than 90K tokens remain in the current phase, and the recent 666,666-token burn adds further scarcity pressure,not tied to stages, but boosting long-term value. As Stage 13D approaches, urgency grows with every minute.

This obstacle arises despite their approval of a law specifically designed for stablecoins this summer. As the lawmakers seek to develop a bill that would establish clear regulations for the crypto market and safeguard clients, Ohio Republican Senator Bernie Moreno expressed his disapproval with the recent bill talks. According to him, a discussion on a bill to oversee the crypto industry is “somewhat frustrating.” Meanwhile, sources close to the situation hinted that Democrats and Republicans are set to meet on Tuesday, December 9. Discussions in a broader bill spark concerns in the crypto industry During the Blockchain Association Policy Summit held in Washington, D.C. on Monday, December 8, Moreno highlighted the ongoing discussion regarding what should be included in a broader bill. The United States Senator argued, “I don’t want to push through a bad bill just to say we passed something.” According to him, there is no better deal than a bad deal. The following day, Moreno announced his intention to meet with Democrats. When reporters inquired about the reason behind this meeting, the Senator mentioned that they would give these democrats room to weigh in on their point of view on this discussion. However, he complained that over the past few weeks, their opinions have been pretty annoying. In the meantime, reports noted that the House and Senate are developing different versions of a market structure bill that must be reconciled. Notably, the House approved its version of a bill in July. This bill, known as the Digital Asset Market Clarity Act or Clarity for short, focused on regulating the crypto ecosystem. Following this approval, reports noted that passing bills in the Senate poses a greater challenge than in the House. Regarding Moreno’s concerns about recent bill talks, analysts discovered that the Senator is a member of the Senate Banking Committee. This committee plays a crucial role in drafting its own version of a crypto market structure bill. Under the leadership of Republicans, it managed to create a draft that aims to define jurisdiction between two key agencies in the crypto industry: the SEC and CFTC. This draft also seeks to introduce a new term to categorize ancillary assets. This term will clarify which type of cryptocurrencies are not viewed as securities. To achieve these goals, sources suggested that the Senate Banking Committee should collaborate with the Senate Agriculture Committee. This proposal was raised after last month’s reports highlighted that the Agriculture Committee shared a draft law that would give new power to the CFTC. Both bills must undergo an important process to implement changes before they can be made available for voting during congressional hearings. Uncertainties surround the upcoming committee’s markup hearing Following the existence of the two bills, a reliable source shared an audio made last week, revealing that Tim Scott, the Chair of the Senate Banking Committee and a Republican from South Carolina, assured the audience at a “Crypto Christmas” event that there is a practical way to have the committee’s markup hearing on December 17 or 18. However, Senator Mark Warner, a Democrat from Virginia, insisted that it would be difficult to finalize the markup hearing before the holidays. Warner made this statement during a discussion with Eleanor Terrett of Crypto In America. According to him, what they are waiting for at the moment is guidelines from the White House on matters concerning quorum and ethics. Notably, Warner is also a member of the Senate Banking Committee. Crypto In America initially hinted at the expected timing of the markup. Want your project in front of crypto’s top minds?

However, a major breakthrough has arrived for the Sui ecosystem. The digital asset tax platform ZenLedger now officially supports the Sui network, promising to transform a complex chore into a streamlined process. This integration is a game-changer for anyone using SUI, aiming to demystify Sui tax reporting and ensure users stay compliant with evolving regulations. What Does the Sui and ZenLedger Integration Mean for You? This partnership directly tackles one of the biggest pain points in crypto: tax preparation. ZenLedger’s system automatically pulls transaction data from the Sui blockchain. It then aggregates this information with data from your exchanges, wallets, and other DeFi activities. Therefore, instead of manually tracking hundreds of transactions, you get a unified, standardized report. This service is crucial for users, developers, and businesses building on Sui who need accurate financial records. How Does ZenLedger Simplify Sui Tax Reporting? ZenLedger operates by connecting to your crypto activity across the board. For Sui users, the process becomes remarkably simple. First, you connect your Sui wallet addresses to the ZenLedger platform. Then, the software automatically: Imports Transactions : Fetches all your SUI transfers, DeFi interactions, and staking rewards. Calculates Gains/Losses : Applies accounting methods (like FIFO or LIFO) to determine your taxable income. Generates Reports : Creates ready-to-file forms such as IRS Form 8949 and Schedule D for the US, with similar reports for other countries. This automation eliminates human error and saves countless hours, making Sui tax reporting less of a seasonal headache and more of a background process. Why Is Accurate Crypto Tax Compliance So Critical? As governments worldwide increase scrutiny on digital assets, proper reporting is no longer optional. The consequences of inaccurate filings can include penalties, interest charges, or audits. Moreover, for the Sui network to achieve mainstream adoption, it must provide users with tools for real-world financial compliance. This integration with a trusted platform like ZenLedger adds a layer of legitimacy and practicality. It signals that the Sui ecosystem is maturing and addressing the full lifecycle of asset management, not just the technological innovation. Actionable Insights for Sui Network Participants If you’re active on Sui, now is the perfect time to get your records in order. Start by reviewing your transaction history across all Sui applications. Consider using ZenLedger or a similar service before the tax year ends to avoid a last-minute scramble. For developers, this integration is a feature you can highlight to attract users who are concerned about compliance. Ultimately, simplifying Sui tax reporting removes a significant barrier to entry and participation. Conclusion: A Major Step Toward Mainstream Crypto Adoption The collaboration between Sui and ZenLedger is more than a technical add-on; it’s a vital infrastructure upgrade. By seamlessly integrating tax compliance into the user experience, Sui is positioning itself as a forward-thinking, user-friendly blockchain. This move alleviates a major source of anxiety for crypto enthusiasts and paves the way for more confident and widespread use of SUI and its applications. In essence, it turns a complex regulatory challenge into a simple, automated solution. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q: Do I need to use ZenLedger if I only have a small amount of SUI? A: Tax obligations typically depend on your jurisdiction’s laws, not the amount. Even small transactions can generate taxable events. Using a platform like ZenLedger helps ensure you don’t miss anything. Q: Can ZenLedger handle my Sui DeFi and staking activities? A> Yes. The integration is designed to pull data from various activities on the Sui network, including decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols and staking rewards, which are often complex to calculate manually. Q: Is my financial data safe with ZenLedger? A> ZenLedger uses read-only access via API keys or wallet addresses. It cannot move your funds. The company also employs bank-level security encryption to protect your data. Q: How does this help if I use multiple blockchains besides Sui? A> This is a key benefit. ZenLedger aggregates data from hundreds of sources. Your Sui tax reporting will be combined with your activity from Ethereum, Solana, or other networks into one comprehensive report. Q: What’s the first step to start using ZenLedger for my Sui taxes? A> Simply create an account on ZenLedger’s website and follow the prompts to connect your Sui wallet addresses. The platform will guide you through the rest. Share This Insight Did you find this guide to simplified Sui tax reporting helpful?

The analyst summed it up by saying DOGE is “licking the bottom of its monthly Ichimoku cloud.” Dogecoin Hovers At Key Monthly Ichimoku Support The 1-month DOGE/USDT chart on Binance, captured on 7 December 2025, shows Dogecoin at around $0.14050, down about 3.8% for the month so far. The monthly candle opened at $0.14599, reached a high of $0.15340 and a low of $0.13177, underlining relatively tight but clearly downward monthly price action. On the chart, the Ichimoku indicator uses standard 9-26-52-26 settings. The fast conversion line (Tenkan-sen) currently sits near $0.20092, and the base line (Kijun-sen) around $0.27491. The leading spans that form the cloud are plotted near $0.23792 and $0.26674, producing a forward-projected red Kumo that extends well into 2026. Related Reading: Analyst Says Dogecoin Price Is Ready To Fly, Here’s Why With DOGE at roughly $0.14, price is trading far below both Tenkan and Kijun and is positioned just at the lower boundary of the projected cloud. That lower cloud edge, which bends into the low-$0.12 to mid-$0.13 area before flattening, is the zone highlighted by Cantonese Cat. The October monthly candle shows a long lower wick that briefly pierced deep below, toward the mid-$0.06 region, but closed back above the cloud floor. The current, still-forming candle again tests just under that boundary and is, at the time of the snapshot, holding marginally above it around $0.14. Related Reading: Dogecoin Bulls Smell $1.30 As On-Chain Data Turns Red-Hot For Ichimoku practitioners, the lower Kumo boundary is often treated as the final structural support in a still-constructive higher-timeframe trend. In this case, the implication of the chart is clear: as long as monthly closes remain above roughly $0.12–$0.14, the multi-year structure can still be interpreted as a long-term bottoming zone rather than a completed breakdown. In other words, for this analyst, Dogecoin’s prospective bottom hinges on whether that monthly Ichimoku support band in the $0.12–$0.14 range continues to hold. DOGE Sits Inside Key Support Zone In The Weekly Chart On the weekly DOGE/USDT chart, price is sitting directly in the highlighted red support zone around $0.135–$0.145. This band coincides with a prior multi-week consolidation area and a former horizontal resistance level that capped price before the last major breakout. Over the past several candles, weekly closes have clustered inside this zone while wicks repeatedly probe through it, underlining how aggressively the market is testing this level. The current candle trades near $0.14392, keeping Dogecoin inside the upper half of the support block but still below the 20-, 50-, 100- and 200-week EMAs, with the 200-week EMA at $0.15563 now just overhead. At the same time, DOGE has clearly lost the rising black trendline that had connected higher lows from the left side of the chart. After breaking beneath this trend support, the DOGE price dropped sharply. The intersection of the broken trendline and the nearby moving averages now forms an overhead supply region, meaning price is compressing between these levels and the red horizontal support zone.

55526643,641936,1765245647,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/55526643.jpeg,Where Are the Sellers? Low Bitcoin Inflows Hint At Holder Conviction Amid Deepest Pullback of 2025,https://bitcoinist.com/low-bitcoin-inflows-hint-at-holder-conviction/,"Bitcoin is attempting to reclaim the $92,000 level as bullish momentum gradually returns after weeks of uncertainty. The market has spent nearly two months in a corrective phase, shedding roughly 36% from its highs, yet signs of stabilization are beginning to emerge. A new CryptoQuant report from analyst Darkfost highlights a striking deviation from typical mid-cycle correction behavior—one that may explain why sentiment is starting to shift. According to the report, inflows of cryptocurrencies onto Binance remain unusually low, even as Bitcoin has experienced one of its deepest pullbacks of the cycle. Historically, during significant corrections, investors tend to send large amounts of BTC and other assets to exchanges, signaling growing willingness to sell and escalating market fear. This pattern appeared repeatedly in past downturns, often marking periods of capitulation. But this time, the data suggests something different: investors are not rushing to offload their holdings. Instead, they appear more comfortable holding through volatility, showing patience rather than panic. Such low inflows contrast sharply with prior mid-cycle resets and hint at a more resilient market structure beneath the surface—one where holders may be preparing for the next phase rather than abandoning ship. A Shift in Inflows Reveals Unusual Investor Behavior Darkfost notes that today’s data shows a markedly different behavior from what Bitcoin typically displays during major corrections. Instead of focusing on BTC alone, the analysis aggregates total inflows of all cryptocurrencies sent to Binance, offering a broader view of market intent. The logic behind this metric is straightforward: rising inflows signal growing selling pressure, while shrinking inflows indicate that investors prefer to hold rather than exit their positions. During previous downturns, inflows surged. In April 2024, right after Bitcoin hit a new all-time high at $73,800, total inflows exceeded 200 million coins, reflecting intense selling pressure. A similar spike appeared in December 2024, as BTC broke above $100,000, signaling that investors were preparing to lock in profits. Today’s environment looks nothing like those periods. Despite experiencing a much deeper correction, inflows are five times lower—and notably stable. Investors are not sending coins to exchanges, which means they’re not eager to sell. Instead, they are sitting through the decline, showing patience rather than panic. This unusual calm suggests a more confident market structure. If selling pressure continues to fade, this investor restraint could become one of the most constructive signals supporting a future bullish recovery once the correction runs its course. Bitcoin Price Action Shows Early Signs of Stabilization Bitcoin’s latest 3-day chart shows the market attempting to stabilize after a sharp two-month correction that pushed the price from above $120,000 to the recent lows near $84,000. The current rebound toward $91,960 reflects improving short-term sentiment, but the broader structure still leans bearish until key levels break. One of the most important developments is BTC’s interaction with the 200-day moving average (red line). The price dipped below it during the flush-out but has now reclaimed it slightly, a signal that sellers may be losing momentum. Historically, regaining the 200MA on high timeframes marks the first stage of recovery after major corrections. However, confirmation requires follow-through and stronger volume—something that remains limited for now. The 50MA and 100MA sit well above price, reflecting the depth of the recent decline and acting as overhead resistance. The clustering of these moving averages between $100,000 and $110,000 forms a heavy supply zone. Bulls would need several consecutive strong candles to break back into that region. Volume has decreased notably during the rebound, suggesting that buyers are still cautious. Until BTC reclaims the $96K–$98K area—where structural resistance and realized-price bands align—this move remains a relief bounce rather than a confirmed bullish reversal.

According to real-time data from Binance’s USDT market, BTC is currently trading at $89,996.28.

Let’s unpack what’s happening and explore the potential implications of this key Bitcoin price movement. Why Did the Bitcoin Price Fall Below $90,000?

Often, such a break below a major round number like $90,000 can be a technical signal for automated trading systems, leading to increased sell pressure. Furthermore, broader macroeconomic conditions, such as interest rate expectations or geopolitical tensions, frequently impact risk assets like Bitcoin. Therefore, understanding the context behind this Bitcoin price drop is essential for making informed decisions. What Does This Mean for Bitcoin Investors? For holders and traders, a sharp Bitcoin price decline can be unsettling. However, volatility is an inherent characteristic of the cryptocurrency market. Here are key considerations for navigating this dip: Long-Term Perspective: Historical data shows Bitcoin has experienced numerous corrections before reaching new highs. A long-term investment strategy often looks beyond short-term volatility. Risk Management: This event underscores the importance of only investing what you can afford to lose and having a clear exit strategy. Opportunity Assessment: Some investors view significant pullbacks as potential buying opportunities to accumulate assets at a lower price point, a strategy known as “buying the dip.” The current Bitcoin price action serves as a critical reminder of the market’s dynamic nature. How Can You Analyze Future Bitcoin Price Movements? Staying informed is your best defense against market uncertainty. To better anticipate future Bitcoin price trends, consider monitoring these aspects: On-Chain Metrics: Data like exchange inflows/outflows and wallet activity can provide insights into holder behavior. Market Sentiment Indicators: Tools that gauge fear and greed in the market can offer contrarian signals. Macroeconomic News: Keep an eye on central bank announcements and global economic data, as they influence all risk markets. By combining these analyses, you can develop a more nuanced view beyond the daily Bitcoin price quote. Navigating Market Volatility with Confidence The journey of Bitcoin is rarely a straight line upward. Periods of consolidation and correction, like the break below $90,000, are part of its market cycle. The key for participants is not to react impulsively to every Bitcoin price swing but to understand the underlying forces at play. Building knowledge, practicing sound risk management, and maintaining emotional discipline are the pillars of navigating this exciting yet unpredictable asset class. Remember, informed decisions are always more powerful than emotional reactions. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: Is Bitcoin’s drop below $90,000 a cause for panic? A: Not necessarily. While significant, Bitcoin has a history of recovering from such corrections. Panic selling often locks in losses; a calm assessment of your strategy is advised. Q2: Could the Bitcoin price fall further from here? A> It is possible. Markets can trend in one direction. The next major support levels, often around previous consolidation zones, would be key areas to watch. Q3: Should I buy Bitcoin now that the price is lower? A: This is a personal investment decision based on your risk tolerance and goals. “Buying the dip” is a common strategy, but it carries risk if the price continues to decline. Q4: What are the main reasons for this sudden Bitcoin price drop? A> Reasons can include large sell orders, negative market sentiment, broader economic factors, or technical breakdowns triggering automated selling. Q5: How does this affect other cryptocurrencies? A: Bitcoin often sets the trend for the broader crypto market. A major Bitcoin price drop frequently leads to declines across altcoins, a phenomenon known as “Bitcoin dominance.” Q6: Where can I get reliable Bitcoin price information? A: Use reputable cryptocurrency data aggregators and major exchange websites. Cross-reference information from multiple trusted sources for accuracy.

That’s the stark reality Fitch Ratings has presented. The agency warns that U.S. banks with a significant crypto business could face serious consequences, including credit rating downgrades. This news sends a clear signal about the perceived risks of mixing traditional finance with digital assets. What Did Fitch Ratings Say About Banks and Crypto? Fitch Ratings, a leading global credit rating agency, issued a report highlighting a critical tension for banks. On one hand, activities like stablecoin issuance or using blockchain technology offer new paths for profit. On the other, they introduce substantial new risks. The agency specifically stated that banks with large-scale, crypto-related operations may be subject to “negative rating actions.” This is a formal way of saying their credit scores could be lowered. Why Does a Crypto Business Pose a Risk to Banks? You might wonder how a modern crypto business could threaten a century-old bank’s stability. Fitch points to several interconnected dangers that go beyond simple market volatility. Reputation Risk: The crypto sector is still associated with high-profile failures and scandals. A bank’s involvement can damage its trusted image if something goes wrong. Liquidity Risk: Crypto markets can freeze or become unstable rapidly. If a bank needs to access funds tied up in digital assets during a crisis, it might not be able to. Operational Risk: Managing digital assets requires new technology and security protocols, increasing the chance of technical failures or cyber-attacks. Regulatory Risk: The rules for cryptocurrency are still evolving. A bank could face heavy penalties or be forced to abandon profitable ventures if regulations change. These risks, when combined, can weaken a bank’s overall financial profile, which is precisely what credit rating agencies assess. Which Major Banks Are Already in the Crypto Arena? This warning isn’t about hypothetical banks. Fitch’s report mentions that industry giants like JPMorgan, Bank of America, Citi, and Wells Fargo are already involved in the crypto sector. Their activities range from custody services and blockchain projects to facilitating client transactions. This means the warning has direct implications for some of the world’s most influential financial institutions. Their foray into digital assets is now under a microscope, with their creditworthiness potentially on the line. What Does This Mean for the Future of Banking and Crypto? Fitch’s stance creates a significant dilemma. Banks are under pressure to innovate and find new revenue streams, and cryptocurrency presents a major opportunity. However, pursuing this crypto business now comes with a formal warning label from a key player in global finance. This will likely force banks to be extremely cautious. They may slow their expansion, invest more in risk management, or wait for clearer regulations before deepening their involvement. The message is clear: growth in crypto must be balanced against the foundational need for stability and trust. In conclusion, Fitch Ratings has drawn a line in the sand. While acknowledging the potential benefits, the agency has prioritized caution, signaling that reckless expansion into cryptocurrency could erode the very foundations of a bank’s credit strength. For the financial industry, navigating this crypto business landscape will require a careful, measured approach where innovation does not compromise resilience. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) What is a credit rating downgrade? A credit rating downgrade is when an agency like Fitch lowers its score for a company or government. It signals higher risk to lenders, which can make borrowing more expensive and damage confidence. Does this mean banks should avoid crypto completely? Not necessarily. The warning is about “significant” or “large-scale” operations. It encourages banks to manage their crypto involvement carefully and ensure risks are controlled, not to avoid it altogether. How could this affect regular bank customers? If a bank’s rating is downgraded, it might become more cautious with lending or offer less favorable rates to protect its stability. It could also slow the rollout of new crypto-related services to customers. Are all crypto activities equally risky for banks? No. Fitch noted that different activities carry different risk levels. For example, simply using blockchain for internal efficiency is less risky than issuing a public stablecoin that must always be redeemable. What can banks do to mitigate these risks? Banks can invest in robust compliance systems, maintain high liquidity buffers specifically for crypto operations, conduct thorough due diligence, and engage proactively with regulators. Will this stop the adoption of cryptocurrency by traditional finance? It is more likely to slow and shape adoption rather than stop it. Banks will probably proceed more deliberately, with a stronger focus on risk management and regulatory alignment. Found this analysis of banks and crypto business risks insightful?

The real debate now centres on what comes next, with investors increasingly nervous that policymakers will signal a “slower pace” of easing in the months ahead. Still high inflation and a lack of fresh data during the government shutdown have fed “divisions” inside the Fed, according to some investors and analysts. After this week’s likely cut, money markets now lean toward only two more moves by the end of 2026, down from three that were priced in barely a week ago, a shift that matters for Bitcoin and other digital assets that trade closely with global liquidity conditions. In bond markets, the US 10-year Treasury yield hit its highest level since September during Monday’s session, extending selling pressure in Europe and Japan and lending support to the dollar. Higher long term yields tend to tighten financial conditions, a backdrop that can cap risk appetite even as traders talk about rate cuts. Markets Waver As December Cut Bets Firm But Policy Path Remains Unclear Wall Street’s main indexes closed lower on Monday, with most S&P 500 sectors finishing in negative territory while Treasury yields pushed higher. Hopes for a December rate cut firmed after data last week showed consumer spending increased “moderately” toward the end of the third quarter, although investors still want clearer signals on future policy moves from what many see as the most “divided Fed” in years. Derivatives pricing reflects that tension. Traders are now assigning roughly an 89% chance of a 25 basis-point cut on Wednesday, while expectations for additional easing have been trimmed. For crypto markets, any surprise in the statement or the press conference could quickly show up in sharp moves around the $90,000 level. Policy Signals From Beijing And Washington Guide Asian Equities And Crypto Chinese assets remained in the background as Beijing’s top leaders set “domestic demand” as their main economic priority for 2026 while signalling a measured approach to stimulus. Any conviction that China will stabilise growth without aggressive easing could influence regional risk appetite and therefore the broader tone for Asian equities and crypto alike. Monetary policy politics are also in play. Kevin Hassett, seen as a leading candidate to become the next Fed chair, said it would be irresponsible for the Fed to lay out a plan for where it aims to take interest rates over the next six months. The White House National Economic Council director told CNBC that following the economic data remains crucial, a stance that points to more meeting-by-meeting decisions rather than a pre-set easing path. For crypto traders, the coming days look pivotal. Greg Magadini, director of derivatives at Amberdata, said this upcoming week is going to be driven by the FOMC rate decision. “This will set the tone for the EOY sentiment. Odds are shifting toward a -25bps cut, which could set the stage for an end-of-year rally in crypto and risk assets,” he said. He added that Trump is expected to announce his pick for Fed chair in early 2026, with Senate approval to follow and the new chair taking over in May 2026 after Powell. That handover, combined with this week’s decision, is already feeding into long-term positioning in Bitcoin and the rest of the digital asset market, even as prices hold near $90,000 for now.

South Korea’s leading exchange, Bithumb, has announced a critical operational pause. To ensure a smooth and secure transition, Bithumb will temporarily suspend deposits and withdrawals for Ethereum (ETH) and all related assets. This essential measure supports the upcoming Ethereum network hard fork , a significant upgrade to the blockchain’s core protocol. The suspension, effective from 12:00 p.m. UTC, is a standard safety procedure adopted by exchanges worldwide during such events. What Does This Ethereum Network Hard Fork Mean for You? If you use Bithumb, this announcement directly impacts your trading activity. The suspension applies not just to ETH but extends to all tokens built on the Ethereum blockchain and a significant list of 18 Ethereum Layer 2 networks. These Layer 2 solutions, like Arbitrum and Optimism, are popular for their speed and lower fees. Therefore, this is a broad pause affecting a wide ecosystem of assets. The primary goal is to protect user funds during the Ethereum network hard fork , preventing any potential transaction errors or loss that could occur if the network splits temporarily. Why Are Exchanges Like Bithumb Taking This Step? You might wonder why a simple software update requires such a drastic measure. A hard fork is a fundamental change to a blockchain’s rules. Nodes that do not upgrade to the new software will operate on a separate chain from those that do. This creates a period of uncertainty. By suspending movements, Bithumb ensures: Fund Security: No transactions are sent to an incorrect or outdated chain. Network Stability: Allows the upgrade to proceed without exchange traffic interfering. Seamless Integration: Gives the exchange’s technical team time to update their own systems to be compatible with the new chain. This proactive approach is a hallmark of responsible exchange management and is crucial for maintaining trust during essential network upgrades. Which Assets Are Affected by This Suspension? The scope of this suspension is comprehensive. While ETH is the primary asset, the pause encompasses the entire Ethereum ecosystem on Bithumb. This includes: All ERC-20 tokens (like USDT, USDC, SHIB, etc.) Assets on 18 specific Ethereum Layer 2 networks Any other asset whose transaction validation depends on the Ethereum mainnet It is vital to note that trading of these assets within the Bithumb exchange may continue normally. The restriction is solely on moving assets onto or off of the Bithumb platform. Always check Bithumb’s official announcement for the precise list and the most current status. How Should You Prepare as a Trader or Holder? Don’t get caught off guard. With the Ethereum network hard fork imminent, taking a few simple steps can save you from frustration. Plan Your Transactions: Complete any urgent deposits or withdrawals well before the 12:00 p.m. UTC deadline. Monitor Official Channels: Follow Bithumb’s official blog and social media for the “all-clear” announcement once services resume. Understand the Fork: Research the specific hard fork (like the Dencun upgrade) to understand its technical benefits for scalability and fees. Stay Calm: This is a routine operational procedure, not a cause for alarm regarding the safety of your funds on the exchange. The Bigger Picture: Why Hard Forks Are Essential for Ethereum While temporarily inconvenient, these upgrades are the lifeblood of blockchain innovation. Each Ethereum network hard fork introduces improvements that enhance security, efficiency, and functionality. Past hard forks have paved the way for staking, reduced energy consumption, and laid the groundwork for future scaling. This temporary pause by Bithumb is a small price to pay for the long-term health and evolution of the entire Ethereum ecosystem, which benefits all developers and users. Conclusion: A Temporary Pause for Long-Term Gain Bithumb’s decision to suspend ETH and Layer 2 transfers is a standard, safety-first response to a significant Ethereum network hard fork . It underscores the exchange’s commitment to protecting user assets during critical blockchain upgrades. For traders, it serves as a reminder of the evolving nature of cryptocurrency infrastructure. By planning ahead and understanding the reasons behind such measures, you can navigate these events with confidence, knowing they are designed to build a more robust and capable network for the future. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: Can I still trade ETH on Bithumb during the suspension? A1: Typically, yes. The suspension usually applies only to deposits and withdrawals (moving crypto in/out of Bithumb). Trading ETH against other pairs on the exchange’s internal order book often continues as normal. However, always confirm with the latest Bithumb notice. Q2: How long will the suspension last? A2: The duration varies but is usually between a few hours and a couple of days. It depends on the complexity of the hard fork and how quickly the exchange’s technical team can verify network stability. Bithumb will announce when services resume. Q3: Are my funds safe on Bithumb during this time? A3: Yes. The suspension is a preventive measure to ensure fund safety. Your assets remain securely held in Bithumb’s wallets. The action is taken to avoid any technical errors during the chain transition, not because of any security breach. Q4: What is an Ethereum Layer 2 network? A4: Layer 2 networks are separate blockchains built on top of Ethereum (the Layer 1). They process transactions off the main chain to improve speed and reduce costs, then batch-settle the final data back on Ethereum. Examples include Arbitrum, Optimism, and Polygon zkEVM. Q5: Will I receive new forked tokens from this hard fork? A5: Most modern Ethereum hard forks are “upgrade” forks, not “chain-split” forks. This means there is no new competing token created. The network simply upgrades its rules. Exchanges like Bithumb typically only support the upgraded canonical chain. Q6: Do other exchanges also suspend services for hard forks? A6: Absolutely. It is an industry-standard best practice. Major global exchanges like Binance, Coinbase, and Kraken also implement similar temporary suspensions during significant network upgrades to guarantee user protection.

The U.S. Department of Justice announced the plea, revealing a social engineering scheme that siphoned a staggering 4,100 Bitcoin, valued at approximately $371 million, from unsuspecting victims. This case serves as a stark reminder of the persistent threats in the digital asset space. How Did This Massive BTC Phishing Scam Operate? According to court documents, the criminal group executed a complex fraud between October 2023 and May 2024. Their primary weapon was a fraudulent online gaming platform that operated in states including California and Connecticut. This was not a simple hack; it was a calculated BTC phishing scam built on deception. The conspirators used social engineering tactics to lure users. They likely promised high returns, exclusive gaming experiences, or fake investment opportunities within the platform. Once users engaged and connected their crypto wallets, the thieves stole their funds. The scale—4,100 BTC—highlights how effective and damaging this type of scam can be. What Does a Guilty Plea Mean for Crypto Crime? The guilty plea is a significant victory for law enforcement. It signals that authorities are improving their ability to track, apprehend, and prosecute individuals involved in complex crypto crimes. This particular BTC phishing scam involved cross-state operations, making the investigation challenging. However, the plea also brings hope for victim restitution. While recovering all stolen funds is often difficult, successful prosecution can lead to asset seizures and court-ordered repayments. This case sets a precedent, showing that even in the seemingly anonymous world of cryptocurrency, illegal actions have serious consequences. How Can You Protect Yourself from Phishing Scams? This incident underscores the critical need for vigilance. Phishing scams are evolving, moving beyond fake emails to elaborate fake platforms. Here are actionable steps to protect your assets: Verify Platform Authenticity: Always double-check website URLs and official social media channels. Look for spelling errors and poor design, which are common red flags. Use Hardware Wallets: For significant holdings, never store all your crypto on an exchange or in a hot wallet connected to dApps or gaming sites. A hardware wallet provides an essential air gap. Enable Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA): Use MFA on all accounts related to your crypto activity. This adds a crucial layer of security beyond just a password. Be Skeptical of “Too Good to Be True” Offers: High-yield promises in gaming or DeFi are major warning signs. Legitimate platforms rarely guarantee extravagant returns. The Lasting Impact of This Landmark Case This guilty plea is more than just a news headline. It represents a growing crackdown on digital asset fraud and a clear message from the Department of Justice.

This crucial milestone represents more than just another technical update—it’s a gateway for builders to finally deploy scalable applications on a production-ready Layer 2 solution. For developers who have been navigating Ethereum’s congestion and high fees, the MegaETH mainnet beta offers a promising alternative that could transform how decentralized applications are built and experienced. What Does the MegaETH Mainnet Beta Mean for Developers? The Frontier release marks MegaETH’s transition from test environments to a live, developer-facing platform. Unlike previous testnets, this MegaETH mainnet beta provides the actual infrastructure where applications will eventually serve real users. Developers gain early access to deploy and test their dApps in an environment that mirrors final production conditions. This phased approach allows the MegaETH team to identify and resolve potential issues before opening the platform to general users, ensuring a smoother experience for everyone involved. Following the initial release to developers, the platform will undergo several weeks of intensive testing and optimization. During this critical period, the MegaETH team will provide dedicated support for application deployment, debugging, and performance tuning. This developer-focused phase demonstrates MegaETH’s commitment to creating a robust foundation rather than rushing to market. The careful rollout strategy reflects industry best practices for launching complex blockchain infrastructure. Why Should Developers Pay Attention to This Launch? The MegaETH mainnet beta arrives at a time when Ethereum scaling solutions are becoming increasingly competitive. However, MegaETH distinguishes itself through several key features that developers will find compelling: Production-Ready Environment: Test your applications under real network conditions Dedicated Support: Receive direct assistance during the deployment phase Early Advantage: Position your dApp ahead of the competition before user onboarding begins Feedback Integration: Help shape the platform’s final features through your testing experience For blockchain developers, accessing the MegaETH mainnet beta represents a strategic opportunity. Early adopters can optimize their applications, identify potential integration challenges, and establish their presence on what could become a major Layer 2 ecosystem. The weeks following the Frontier release will be particularly valuable for teams looking to perfect their user experience before the platform opens to the public. What Comes After the MegaETH Mainnet Beta Release? The deployment timeline follows a logical progression designed to maximize stability and user experience. After the developer-focused phase concludes, MegaETH will begin onboarding regular users to the platform. This staggered approach serves multiple purposes: it allows developers to refine their applications based on real testing data, enables the MegaETH team to scale infrastructure gradually, and ensures that when users finally arrive, they encounter polished, functional dApps rather than experimental prototypes. This careful rollout strategy addresses common pitfalls in blockchain launches where platforms open to users before applications are ready. By prioritizing developer experience first, MegaETH increases the likelihood that users will find compelling applications immediately available. The success of any Layer 2 solution ultimately depends on the quality of applications running on it, making this developer-first approach particularly strategic. How Does This Impact the Broader Ethereum Ecosystem? The MegaETH mainnet beta contributes to Ethereum’s ongoing scaling narrative by providing another viable option for developers seeking affordable, fast transaction processing. As more Layer 2 solutions reach maturity, the entire ecosystem benefits from increased competition, innovation, and choice. Developers now have additional options when deciding where to deploy their applications, while users gain access to more scalable dApps across different platforms. However, challenges remain. The proliferation of Layer 2 solutions creates fragmentation concerns, and developers must consider interoperability between different scaling solutions. The MegaETH team will need to address these ecosystem-wide considerations as their platform matures. Nevertheless, the arrival of another production-ready scaling solution represents positive momentum for Ethereum’s long-term scalability goals. Conclusion: A Strategic Step Forward for Ethereum Scaling The MegaETH mainnet beta Frontier release represents a calculated, developer-focused approach to launching Layer 2 infrastructure. By prioritizing application development and testing before user onboarding, MegaETH increases the platform’s chances of delivering a polished, functional ecosystem from day one. For developers, this provides a valuable window to prepare their applications and potentially gain first-mover advantages in a new scaling environment. As the Ethereum ecosystem continues to evolve toward a multi-Layer 2 future, solutions like MegaETH contribute to the diversity and resilience of the network. The coming weeks will reveal how developers respond to this new option and what innovative applications emerge from the Frontier testing phase. One thing remains certain: the race for Ethereum scalability just gained another serious contender. Frequently Asked Questions When exactly will developers get access to the MegaETH mainnet beta? MegaETH announced that Frontier will be released to app developers next week, though the company hasn’t specified an exact date. Developers should monitor official MegaETH channels for the precise launch timing. How long will the developer testing phase last? The platform will undergo “several weeks” of support for app deployment and testing before user onboarding begins. This suggests developers will have at least 3-4 weeks to work with the MegaETH mainnet beta before it opens to general users. What kind of support will MegaETH provide during testing? While specific details haven’t been released, the announcement mentions “support for app deployment and testing,” which typically includes technical documentation, developer tools, debugging assistance, and potentially direct support channels for early adopters. Can developers deploy production applications immediately? The Frontier release is labeled as a “mainnet beta,” suggesting it’s feature-complete but may still undergo refinements. Developers should treat it as a production-like environment but anticipate possible adjustments before the full public launch. How does MegaETH differ from other Ethereum Layer 2 solutions? While technical specifics weren’t provided in this announcement, MegaETH’s phased rollout strategy distinguishes it through its developer-first approach, prioritizing application readiness before user acquisition. Will there be any incentives for early developers? The announcement doesn’t mention specific incentive programs, but early developers typically benefit from first-mover advantages, platform familiarity, and the opportunity to help shape the ecosystem’s development.

A startling revelation from the Canada Revenue Agency (CRA) suggests many are not. The agency has identified that approximately 40% of cryptocurrency platform users are at a high risk for tax evasion or underreporting. This finding sends a clear message: the era of ambiguous crypto taxation is ending. The CRA is now actively closing legal gaps and pursuing cases, having already recovered millions. Let’s explore what this means for every crypto user in Canada. What Did the CRA Discover About Crypto Tax Evasion? The CRA, through its dedicated cryptocurrency audit program, conducted a risk assessment. It determined that two in five crypto platform users pose a significant compliance risk. This isn’t a minor oversight. The agency is currently investigating over 230 active cases specifically tied to digital assets. Moreover, their efforts have proven financially substantial. Over the past three years, the CRA has collected approximately 100 million Canadian dollars, which is about $73 million USD, from these enforcement actions. This data, reported by Wu Blockchain, highlights a systemic issue in the crypto space. Why Is Crypto Tax Evasion So Prevalent? The CRA itself points to a primary challenge: legal and identification gaps. For years, the pseudonymous nature of blockchain transactions created a gray area. However, the rules have always been clear. In Canada, cryptocurrencies are treated as commodities, and transactions can trigger capital gains or business income. The perceived complexity and anonymity led some users to neglect their obligations. Common pitfalls include: Not reporting trades between different cryptocurrencies (e.g., Bitcoin to Ethereum). Forgetting to declare income from staking, mining, or earning crypto. Incorrectly calculating cost basis and capital gains on disposals. Assuming small transactions or losses don’t need to be reported. How Is the CRA Cracking Down on Tax Evasion? The agency is moving beyond assessments and into direct action. A key strategy involves compelling cryptocurrency platforms to disclose user information. For instance, the CRA has demanded data from companies like Dapper Labs, the creator of NBA Top Shot. This legal pressure on service providers shatters the illusion of complete anonymity. The goal is to obtain records of large or frequent transactions to identify taxpayers who have not voluntarily complied. Therefore, if you trade on a regulated exchange, the CRA can likely access your activity. This crackdown is part of a global trend. Tax authorities worldwide are sharing information and developing tools to track blockchain activity. The message is unambiguous: compliance is no longer optional. What Are the Consequences of Crypto Tax Evasion? The risks are severe and go beyond simply paying the owed tax. If the CRA finds you guilty of tax evasion , you face: Substantial penalties and interest on the unpaid amount. Criminal prosecution in severe cases, which can lead to fines and even imprisonment. A reassessment for multiple years , compounding your financial liability. Damage to your financial reputation and credit score. The collected $73 million demonstrates the CRA’s serious intent and capability. Ignorance of the law is not a valid defense. How Can You Ensure Compliance and Avoid Trouble? Taking proactive steps is crucial. First, understand that all crypto activity must be reported on your annual tax return. Start by gathering complete records of all your transactions, including dates, amounts, and values in Canadian dollars. Consider using a reputable crypto tax software to automate calculations. If you have unreported past transactions, the CRA’s Voluntary Disclosures Program (VDP) may allow you to correct your filings without penalty, though strict conditions apply. Consulting with a tax professional experienced in cryptocurrency is one of the smartest investments you can make to navigate this complex area and prevent crypto tax evasion . In conclusion, the CRA’s 40% high-risk finding is a watershed moment for cryptocurrency in Canada. It signals the end of the wild west phase and the beginning of stringent enforcement. The agency is leveraging legal tools, collecting vast sums, and investigating hundreds. For the responsible crypto user, this underscores the importance of meticulous record-keeping and transparent reporting. The path forward is clear: embrace compliance to secure your financial future and contribute to the legitimate growth of the digital asset ecosystem. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: Does the CRA know I own cryptocurrency? A1: If you use a registered cryptocurrency exchange or platform that operates in Canada, the CRA has the legal authority to request user data. They are actively doing so, making it increasingly likely they can identify holders. Q2: Do I need to pay tax if I haven’t cashed out to Canadian dollars? A2: Yes. Taxable events include trading one crypto for another (e.g., Bitcoin for Ethereum), using crypto to buy goods or services, and earning crypto through activities like staking. It’s not just about cashing out. Q3: What if I only made a few small trades? A3: All transactions, regardless of size, are technically subject to reporting. While the tax owed on small gains might be minimal, failing to report them could still be considered non-compliance if discovered. Q4: Can the CRA track transactions on decentralized wallets? A4: Tracking becomes more difficult but not impossible. If you ever moved funds from a known exchange to a private wallet, that initial link exists. Blockchain analysis tools are also advancing rapidly. Q5: What should I do if I haven’t reported crypto taxes in previous years? A5: You should speak to a tax professional immediately. They can advise you on the best course of action, which may involve using the CRA’s Voluntary Disclosures Program to correct past returns before the agency contacts you. Q6: Are cryptocurrency losses tax-deductible? A6: Yes, capital losses from cryptocurrency can be used to offset capital gains from the same year or carried forward to offset future gains. You must report the transaction to claim the loss. Found this guide on crypto tax evasion risks helpful? Navigating tax rules is essential for every investor.

Is this a strategic accumulation for their own treasury? Could it be for a client’s custody solution? Or is it part of a broader fund management strategy? While the exact purpose isn’t publicly disclosed, the sheer scale demands analysis. Large, traceable moves by reputable firms provide transparency and data points that retail investors rarely see. Why Are Institutional Moves Like This So Important? Institutional activity serves as a key pillar for market maturity. When a firm like Galaxy Digital makes a substantial Galaxy Digital Bitcoin deposit , it validates Bitcoin’s role as a serious institutional asset class. This isn’t speculative day-trading; it’s a calculated allocation of significant capital. Market Confidence: Large deposits can signal long-term belief in Bitcoin’s value proposition, potentially stabilizing prices. Liquidity and Infrastructure: Such moves test and rely on robust custody, settlement, and blockchain infrastructure. Regulatory Clarity: Operating at this scale implies comfort within the existing regulatory framework, encouraging others to follow. Moreover, tracking these flows has become easier with tools like Lookonchain. This transparency is a double-edged sword—it provides valuable insights but also means large players know their moves are watched. Could This Galaxy Digital Transaction Impact Bitcoin’s Price? Direct cause and effect in crypto markets are complex. A single Galaxy Digital Bitcoin deposit of this size is unlikely to cause a sudden price spike on its own. However, it contributes to a larger narrative of institutional accumulation, which can influence market psychology. Consider the following potential impacts: Supply Perception: Moving coins off exchanges into private custody reduces readily available supply, which can be seen as bullish. Sentiment Indicator: It reinforces the idea that sophisticated investors are building positions, not exiting. Network Health: Large transactions demonstrate active use of the Bitcoin network by major financial players. Therefore, while not a direct market order, the psychological and fundamental implications of this deposit are meaningful for overall trend analysis. What Should Crypto Investors Learn From This? For individual investors, the key takeaway isn’t to blindly follow every institutional trade. Instead, use this Galaxy Digital Bitcoin deposit as a learning opportunity. Understand the strategies and patterns of leading firms. It highlights the importance of: On-Chain Analytics: Using tools to monitor wallet activity and large transfers. Macro Trends: Seeing beyond daily volatility to focus on long-term adoption signals. Portfolio Strategy: Considering how institutional adoption might shape future market structure. Galaxy Digital’s action is a data point in a much larger story of digital asset integration into global finance. Conclusion: A Clear Signal in a Noisy Market The recent Galaxy Digital Bitcoin deposit of $81.6 million is a powerful reminder that institutional players are not just observing the crypto space—they are actively participating at a colossal scale. This move underscores a continuing trend of capital allocation to Bitcoin, reinforcing its status as a digital gold for the modern era. For the astute observer, it provides a glimpse into the strategic thinking that drives the upper echelons of crypto finance. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: Who is Galaxy Digital? A1: Galaxy Digital is a leading financial services and investment management firm dedicated to the digital asset and cryptocurrency sector, founded by former hedge fund manager Mike Novogratz. Q2: Why did Galaxy Digital move 900 BTC to a new address? A2: The specific reason is not publicly disclosed. Common possibilities include internal treasury management, preparing assets for a client, or moving funds to a more secure custody solution.

A3: Blockchain analytics platforms like Lookonchain, Chainalysis, and Etherscan allow anyone to view large transactions on public ledgers by tracking wallet addresses known to belong to institutions.

Related Reading: ‘Something Big’ Is Coming For XRP, Says Toroso Investments Portfolio Manager As large investors deepen their presence and developers explore changes that could make transaction fees more predictable, sentiment on Wall Street has shifted sharply recently. For many, the combination of tightening supply and improving fundamentals has created conditions that could support a meaningful repricing. Exchange Supply Tightens as Institutions Accelerate Accumulation Ethereum held on centralized exchanges has fallen to its lowest level since the network launched in 2015. Glassnode data shows that balances dropped to 8.7% of the total supply last week, marking a 43% decline since July. The reduction is tied to staking, layer-2 migration, institutional custody, and long-term treasury allocations, destinations that rarely send tokens back to exchanges. BitMine Immersion Technologies, now the largest corporate holder of Ether, expanded its position by another $199 million over the weekend. The firm controls $11.3 billion in ETH, representing about 3.08% of supply, and continues buying toward its 5% target. ETFs have also contributed to the drawdown, with cumulative inflows now above $12 billion. Analysts note that nearly 40% of all ETH is locked in staking or institutional products, creating one of the tightest supply environments the asset has experienced. Technical analysts point to hidden signs of accumulation. Recent On-Balance Volume readings have broken above resistance, even as the price lingers near $3,050, a divergence that some interpret as indicating buying pressure. Fee Reform Pushes Forward as Vitalik Buterin Proposes Gas Futures Market Alongside market activity, a new economic proposal from Vitalik Buterin is drawing attention. The Ethereum co-founder outlined a system for onchain gas futures that would allow users to lock in transaction fees for future time periods. The mechanism resembles traditional futures markets and is designed to help traders and developers hedge against sudden increases in network demand. Buterin argues that clearer forward pricing could support businesses that rely on predictable costs, particularly as activity expands across staking, tokenization, and decentralized applications. Although still in its early stages, the idea is viewed as part of a broader effort to make Ethereum more stable as it scales. Analysts See Conditions Forming for a Larger Cycle Market commentators increasingly cite a combination of shrinking supply, rising institutional involvement, and improving network efficiency as reasons Ethereum may outperform in the next major cycle. Some compare current dynamics to Bitcoin eight years ago, noting that Ethereum’s evolving economic model and expanding role in tokenized finance give it a broader set of drivers than in previous cycles. Related Reading: Trump’s New Security Strategy Leaves Crypto And Blockchain Out Whether these developments immediately translate into price gains remains uncertain. But with exchange balances at record lows and institutions steadily accumulating, analysts agree that Ethereum is entering a structurally different phase, one defined less by speculation and more by sustained demand.

Momentum is building, but the market now awaits to see whether bulls can force a breakout or if a deeper pullback ensues. Ethereum Holds The Line: $3,000 Support Ignites Fresh Upside According to a recent update by analyst Ted Pillows, Ethereum has demonstrated resilience in the face of recent market volatility. The asset successfully held up the crucial $3,000 level and is now showing signs of moving higher, suggesting that this level remains a strong foundation for the current price action. Related Reading: Ethereum Shows Strength: Indicators Suggest Bigger Moves Ahead Ted highlighted a significant external factor contributing to the upward pressure: some large whales have reportedly opened ETH long positions. This institutional or large-scale buying interest has been identified as a major driver fueling the current price move, suggesting that deep-pocketed investors anticipate further appreciation. The analyst provided a clear trigger zone for the next significant leg up. If ETH can break decisively above the $3,300–$3,400 level, it will serve as structural confirmation, expected to trigger a swift rally to the next resistance zone between $3,700 and $3,800. However, Ted also outlined the risk scenario. A failure to break above the $3,300–$3,400 zone could result in the asset turning back down for another retest of the foundational $3,000 zone. Upside Reaction Expected From Major Support Zone In an earlier update, More Crypto Online highlighted that Ethereum is currently reacting from a major weekly support zone, suggesting that an upside move remains likely. However, the analysis also noted the possibility of one more low before a stronger reaction takes shape, keeping both scenarios firmly in play. Related Reading: Ethereum Is Sitting On Its Most Critical On-Chain Support Level — A Rally Emerging? The key resistance area above remains the most important region to watch. Once ETH approaches this zone, the market will essentially be forced to decide which direction it will take over. Both bullish and bearish scenarios remain valid based on the broader market structure. What ultimately shifts the probability toward one side is how ETH behaves at these critical levels. A sustained hold and strong reaction could reinforce the bullish case, while weakness or rejection could signal the opposite. For now, the market is still in the phase before major confirmation. If Ethereum loses support and forms a clear five-wave decline to the downside, the bearish “white scenario” becomes the leading outlook. Until then, the chart simply outlines the conditions that will reveal the market’s preferred path once price makes its next decisive move.

This approach, often called ‘HODLing’ in crypto circles, signals a long-term belief in Bitcoin’s value proposition. For companies like ANAP, a Bitcoin treasury acts as a potential hedge against inflation and currency devaluation. Moreover, it diversifies their asset portfolio beyond traditional cash and equivalents. What Does This Mean for Corporate Bitcoin Adoption?

The move from speculation to strategic reserve asset is a significant evolution for Bitcoin. How Can Other Businesses Learn from This Bitcoin Treasury Strategy? For executives watching this trend, ANAP’s playbook offers actionable insights. First, they set a clear, public goal (1,000+ BTC). Second, they executed purchases steadily, likely averaging into the market. This disciplined approach mitigates volatility risk compared to a single, large buy.

Over the past 24 hours, forced crypto liquidations have wiped out millions in leveraged positions, revealing a clear split in trader sentiment between major assets. While Bitcoin bulls faced pressure, bears betting against Ethereum and Zcash took the hardest hits. Let’s break down what these crypto liquidations mean for the market’s direction. What Do These Massive Crypto Liquidations Tell Us? The data paints a clear picture of conflicting expectations. Forced crypto liquidations occur when a trader’s leveraged position suffers such significant losses that the exchange automatically closes it to prevent further debt. This recent wave highlights where traders were most confident—and most wrong. Bitcoin (BTC): $63.27 million liquidated, with 51.99% being long positions. This suggests many traders betting on a price rise were stopped out. Ethereum (ETH): $49.96 million liquidated, but here, 58.16% were short positions. Traders expecting ETH to fall were forced to cover. Zcash (ZEC): A staggering 83.66% of its $14.60 million in liquidations were short positions, indicating a strong, unexpected move against bearish bets. This divergence is crucial. It shows the market is not moving in unison, and asset-specific narratives are driving volatility. Why Are Bitcoin Longs Getting Liquidated? Bitcoin’s price action has been trapped in a range, leading to frustration. When the price fails to break upward, over-leveraged long positions become vulnerable to even small dips. The prevalence of long crypto liquidations for BTC signals that bullish momentum is struggling. Traders may have entered longs expecting a breakout that didn’t materialize, leaving them exposed when support levels were tested. This creates a cascade effect, where each liquidation fuels more selling pressure. How Can Traders Navigate This Volatility? Surviving periods of high crypto liquidations requires discipline and risk management. First, understand that leverage amplifies both gains and losses. Using lower leverage can prevent a minor price swing from wiping out your position. Second, always use stop-loss orders. They won’t always save you from a flash crash, but they are a critical line of defense. Finally, pay attention to funding rates. Persistently high positive rates can signal an overcrowded long trade, which often precedes a flush-out. Remember, these crypto liquidations are not just numbers; they represent real capital being removed from the market, which can impact liquidity and price discovery in the short term. What’s the Outlook After a Liquidation Event? Large-scale crypto liquidations often act as a reset button. They wipe out overextended positions, which can reduce selling pressure (if longs are liquidated) or fuel a short squeeze (if shorts are liquidated). The Ethereum and Zcash data suggest a potential short squeeze occurred, forcing bears to buy back assets to close their positions, ironically pushing prices higher. For Bitcoin, the long liquidations may have removed weak hands, potentially setting the stage for a more stable foundation if buying interest returns. In summary, the recent crypto liquidations underscore the peril and opportunity in leveraged trading. They reveal the market’s fragile consensus and serve as a stark reminder that in crypto, risk management is not optional—it’s essential for survival. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) What are crypto liquidations? Crypto liquidations happen when an exchange automatically closes a trader’s leveraged position because it has lost too much of its initial margin. This prevents the trader’s account from going into negative balance. Why were more Ethereum positions short? A higher percentage of short liquidations for ETH suggests the price moved upwards against traders’ expectations. This could be due to positive news, technical breakout, or a cascade of shorts being forced to buy back ETH, creating a “short squeeze.” Are liquidations bad for the market? They create short-term volatility and pain for affected traders. However, they can also be healthy by removing excessive leverage, which reduces systemic risk and can lead to a more stable price floor. How can I avoid getting liquidated? Use lower leverage, employ sensible stop-loss orders, avoid over-investing in a single trade, and constantly monitor market conditions and your position’s health. Do large liquidations signal a market top or bottom? Not definitively. While massive long liquidations can occur near market bottoms (capitulation) and short liquidations near tops, they are better viewed as indicators of extreme sentiment and leverage being flushed out, not precise timing signals. Where can I track liquidation data? Websites like Coinglass and Bybit provide real-time liquidation heatmaps and data across multiple exchanges, helping traders gauge market sentiment and potential pressure points.

To support a significant network upgrade, Binance will suspend all NTRN deposits and withdrawals starting at 2:00 p.m. UTC on December 10. This planned Binance NTRN suspension is a standard procedure for major blockchain improvements, but it requires user awareness to avoid any trading disruptions. What Does the Binance NTRN Suspension Mean for You? First, do not panic. A temporary suspension for a network upgrade is a routine and positive event in the crypto ecosystem. It signifies progress and enhancement for the Neutron blockchain. However, this Binance NTRN suspension means you will be unable to move your NTRN tokens into or out of your Binance wallet during the maintenance window. Therefore, you need to plan your transactions accordingly. Here is a clear breakdown of what will and will not be affected: Impacted Services: All deposit and withdrawal functions for the Neutron (NTRN) token on Binance. Unaffected Services: Trading of NTRN spot pairs on the Binance exchange will continue as normal during this period. Your assets remain safe in your wallet. Why Are Network Upgrades and Exchange Suspensions Necessary? You might wonder why a leading platform like Binance needs to halt services. The reason is security and synchronization. When a blockchain like Neutron undergoes a core upgrade (often called a hard fork or mainnet upgrade), all network participants, including exchanges, must update their software to the new protocol. If Binance continued processing transactions during the switch, it could lead to lost funds or failed transactions. The temporary Binance NTRN suspension acts as a safety measure. It allows their systems to update seamlessly and ensures that when services resume, everything functions perfectly with the new, improved network. Your Action Plan Before the December 10 Deadline Proactivity is key. To ensure a smooth experience, consider these simple steps before 2:00 p.m. UTC on December 10. Complete Planned Transfers: If you need to deposit NTRN to Binance for trading or withdraw to a private wallet, do so well in advance of the deadline. No Last-Minute Moves: Avoid initiating transactions close to the suspension time, as they may not be processed. Monitor Official Channels: Follow Binance’s official announcements for the exact time when services will be reinstated after the upgrade. Remember, this suspension is for network support. It reflects Binance’s commitment to providing a secure and reliable trading environment. Such upgrades often bring benefits like increased transaction speed, enhanced security features, or new functionality to the Neutron ecosystem. Looking Beyond the Suspension: What’s Next for NTRN? Once the upgrade is complete and the Binance NTRN suspension is lifted, the Neutron network will operate on its upgraded protocol. For users, this should translate to a more robust and efficient experience. Historically, successful network upgrades can have a positive long-term impact on a token’s utility and perception within the market. In conclusion, the scheduled pause for NTRN on Binance is a standard operational procedure for a significant technological step forward. By understanding the reason behind it and taking simple preparatory actions, you can navigate this brief interruption without issue. The ultimate goal is a stronger, more capable Neutron blockchain for all participants. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: Can I still trade NTRN on Binance during the suspension? A1: Yes. The suspension only affects deposits and withdrawals. Spot trading of NTRN trading pairs will continue normally on the Binance exchange. Q2: How long will the Binance NTRN suspension last? A2: Binance has not specified an end time. The suspension begins at 2:00 p.m. UTC on Dec. 10 and will last until the network upgrade is stable and their systems are updated. Users should monitor Binance’s official announcements for the resumption notice. Q3: Are my NTRN tokens safe on Binance during this time? A3: Absolutely. Your assets remain secure in your Binance wallet. The suspension is a preventive measure to ensure the safety of funds during the technical transition. Q4: What happens if I send NTRN to my Binance deposit address during the suspension? A4: Transactions sent during the suspension period will not be credited and could be lost. It is crucial to wait until Binance officially confirms that deposit services have resumed before sending any NTRN. Q5: Will other exchanges also suspend NTRN services? A5: It is highly likely. Most major exchanges supporting NTRN will announce similar suspension periods to perform their own network upgrades. Always check the announcements from the specific exchange you use. Q6: Where can I get the most reliable updates on this situation? A6: The only source for definitive information is the official Binance Announcements page or their verified social media channels. Avoid relying on unofficial sources or rumors. Found this guide on the Binance NTRN suspension helpful?

According to a report posted by the agency, Fitch Ratings maintained that although crypto integrations, which have the potential to increase fees, yields, and efficiency, bring “reputational, liquidity, operational, and compliance” benefits, they are generally risky for banks. U.S. banks race into crypto amid opportunities and risks Several leading American lenders , including JPMorgan Chase, Bank of America, Citigroup, and Wells Fargo, have announced initiatives over the last few months to offer digital asset services. Regulations will be updated to accommodate these changes. The current legislative focus, particularly the GENIUS Act and the CLARITY Act, could pave the way for the widespread adoption of stablecoins, enabling a seismic expansion of participation in digital-asset of ferings. In Fitch’s view, such developments offer banks a chance to boost fee income, increase yields, streamline operations, and modernize services — all of which appeal to institutions seeking growth in a challenging macroeconomic environment. Fitch stated that stablecoin issuance, deposit tokenization, and the utilization of blockchain technology offer banks opportunities to improve customer service. They also enable banks to leverage blockchain’s speed and efficiency in areas such as payments and smart contracts. Fitch warned that it could reassess the business models or risk profiles of U.S. banks with concentrated digital-asset exposures, which could harm their ratings. The agency noted that while regulatory advancements in the U.S. are paving the way for a safer cryptocurrency industry, banks still face an uphill battle when dealing with digital assets. “However, banks would need to address challenges around the volatility of cryptocurrency values adequately, the pseudonymity of digital asset owners, and the protection of digital assets from loss or theft to adequately realize the earnings and franchise benefits,” said Fit ch Fitch Ratings is part of the United States’ “Big Three” credit rating bodies, along with Moody’s and S&P Global Ratings. Ratings by these firms — which critics debate — have significant clout in the financial sector, shaping the perception of businesses and their appeal to investors. That means that if Fitch were to downgrade a bank with significant crypto exposure, it could lead to reduced investor confidence, higher borrowing costs, and obstacles to growth. The report highlighted that several major banks are also planning to test the crypto sector. On that note, Bank of America Corp. Chief Executive Officer Brian Moynihan, Citigroup Inc. CEO Jane Fraser, and Wells Fargo & Co. CEO Charlie Scharf are scheduled to meet with senators from both parties on Thursday to discuss cryptocurrency market legislation that could soon come to a vote, according to a person familiar with the plans. The discussions, hosted by the Financial Services Forum, a co alition of major banks , are expect ed t o fo cu s on bankers’ opposi ti on to allowing interest payments on stablecoi ns, along w ith the ab il it y of b anks to com pete in the cr ypto s pa c e and preventing the u se of cryptocurr encies to fa ci li tate illicit ac ti vi ties. Stablecoin surge could pose systemic risks to U.S. financial markets Fitch further cautions that another risk may arise from the explosive growth of the stablecoin market, particularly if it becomes large enough to influence other areas and institutions. For example, the large-scale adoption of stablecoins might affect liquidity in the Treasury market or create new channels of financial instability. Financial system risks could also increase if adoption of stablecoins expands, particularly if it reaches a level sufficient to influence the Treasury market. Fitch Moody’s, a major global financial services company, has also recently highlighted the potential systemic risks of stablecoins in a report from late September, arguing that the widespread adoption of stablecoins in the U.S. could ultimately threaten the legitimacy of the U.S. dollar. The company noted that the high penetration of USD-linked stablecoins, in particular, can weaken monetary transmission, especially where pricing and settlement increasingly occur outside the domestic currency.

Within the broader digital asset ecosystem, some platforms offer additional revenue streams for holders of different assets through cloud computing power, node incentives, and cross-chain asset management. In this trend, cloud computing power services like PEPPER Mining have gained attention. These services don’t mine XRP itself, but rather utilize specialized data centers and multi-chain computing infrastructure to allow users to participate in the computing power generation of mainstream networks like BTC and ETH, while continuing to hold XRP as their core asset. The appeal of this model lies in the fact that holders can obtain additional cash flow through external computing power without changing their existing asset structure or deploying any hardware, thereby enriching their overall asset allocation. For many users focused on long-term value and capital flow efficiency, this approach offers a new possibility—making their asset portfolio more “productive” while maintaining XRP holdings. PEPPER Mining: A New Revenue Channel for XRP Users PEPPER Mining offers a completely new answer. As an AI-powered, internationally compliant green cloud mining platform, PEPPER Mining provides intelligent passive income solutions for global users, including XRP investors. Users can participate in mining mainstream tokens such as BTC, ETC, and DOGE through cloud computing power without any hardware investment or need to build a mining system, and their earnings are settled daily in US dollars. PEPPER Mining’s data centers are located in North America, Europe, and Iceland, all powered by solar, wind, and hydropower, achieving truly low-carbon and green mining. Why do XRP holders need PEPPER Mining? 1. Make your static assets “live”: While waiting for the XRP price to recover, holders can obtain stable income through cloud mining, no longer letting their assets sit idle. 2. Dual-engine income model: On the one hand, holding XRP offers potential appreciation potential; on the other hand, mining generates daily cash flow, achieving a higher overall rate of return. 3. Safe, transparent, and compliant: The platform is supervised by the UK financial regulator and uses SSL encryption and a cold wallet storage system to provide users with professional-grade security. Three steps to start your smart mining income: ① Register an account : Visit the official website and create an account using your email address. New users receive an $18 welcome bonus and can immediately experience free cloud mining. ② Choose a mining contract (supports BTC, ETH, DOGE, etc.) Popular contract examples : Contract Name | Investment Amount | Daily Returns | Total Returns | Net Profit Whatsminer M30S | $100 | $3 | $106 | $6 AvalonMiner A1246 | $500 | $6.75 | $540.50 | $40.50 Antminer S19K Pro | $1,300 | $18.20 | $1,518.40 | $218.40 Bitcoin Miner S21 Pro | $5,000 | $75 | $6,500 | $1,500 Bitcoin Miner S21 XP | $10,000 | $170 | $15,950 | $5,950 ③ Automatic Earnings Daily earnings are automatically calculated.

This initiative is part of a broader digital asset strategy that includes its Digital Asset Network infrastructure connecting to on/off-ramp providers and stablecoin settlements. “We think that we can make a market for our coin in those markets, and we wanted to be able to control the economics, control the compliance, and control the overall distribution, and we think we can grow that beyond that,” Cagwin said.

It also announced a Solana-based “Digital Asset Network designed to bridge the digital and fiat worlds.” “As we evolve into the digital assets space, Western Union’s USDPT will allow us to own the economics linked to stablecoins,” said Devin McGranahan, President and CEO of Western Union at the time. Inflation Soars In These Countries Venezuela has the highest inflation in the world at 172%, according to Trading Economics. South Sudan also has triple-figure inflation. Iran, Haiti, Argentina, and Turkiye all have extreme inflation, ranging from 30% to 45%. Inflation also remains persistently high in many developed countries, such as the UK, Russia, Austria, and Australia, following the pandemic lockdowns. Another problem is that government and central bank inflation figures are often undermeasured and rarely reflect reality. They do not include day-to-day expenses such as groceries and energy bills, which are constantly increasing in most countries.

Acting Chairman Caroline Pham announced the program in Washington, along with new guidance on tokenized collateral and the withdrawal of older rules that no longer align with the GENIUS Act. The pilot marks a shift toward integrating digital assets into futures and swaps markets while giving regulators real time visibility into how tokenized collateral performs. . @CFTCpham Announces Launch of Digital Assets Pilot Program for Tokenized Collateral in Derivatives Markets: https://t.co/okRaxM9aQ9 — CFTC (@CFTC) December 8, 2025 US Derivatives Regulator Opens Path For Tokenized Assets To Back Trades Pham said the initiative aims to give US traders safer, CFTC-supervised venues after heavy losses on offshore platforms. She added that the agency is “launching a US digital assets pilot program for tokenized collateral, including Bitcoin and Ether,” with guardrails for customer protection and tighter monitoring. The CFTC’s three divisions also issued guidance confirming that tokenized assets can be evaluated under the existing framework. The guidance covers tokenized real-world assets such as US Treasuries and money market funds and addresses custody, segregation, valuation haircuts and operational risks. The agency also granted no-action relief for futures commission merchants that want to accept certain non-securities digital assets as customer margin. Pilot Starts With Bitcoin, Ether And USDC As CFTC Gains Fresh Market Visibility For the first three months, FCMs can only accept BTC, ETH and USDC. They must file weekly reports on the amounts held and notify the agency of any major issues, giving the CFTC early insight into market behaviour without blocking adoption. In a parallel move, the CFTC withdrew a 2020 advisory that restricted the use of virtual currencies as collateral, saying it no longer reflects current market conditions after years of development and the passage of the GENIUS Act. Crypto Execs Call CFTC Guidance A Milestone For US Market Innovation Crypto firms welcomed the shift. Coinbase’s chief legal officer Paul Grewal said the decision confirms that digital assets can make payments faster and cheaper. Circle president Heath Tarbert said supervised stablecoins will reduce settlement frictions and support round-the-clock trading. Crypto.com CEO Kris Marszalek called the guidance “an important milestone,” linking it to President Trump’s goal of making the US “the crypto capital of the world.” Ripple’s Jack McDonald added that recognizing tokenized assets as eligible margin improves capital efficiency and strengthens US leadership in financial innovation. The CFTC said the pilot and guidance reflect recommendations from the Digital Asset Markets Subcommittee and feedback from industry forums. Bitcoin, Ether and USDC are set to take on a more formal role in US derivatives markets as regulators monitor how tokenized collateral performs in practice.

After a brief period of optimism, these popular investment vehicles recorded a significant net outflow of $60.5 million on December 8th. This reversal highlights the ongoing volatility and shifting investor sentiment within the cryptocurrency market. What Do the Spot Bitcoin ETF Outflows Mean? Data from analyst Trader T reveals a clear shift. While BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) managed to attract a net inflow of $28.72 million, it was not enough to counter larger withdrawals. The outflows were primarily driven by two major funds, creating a net negative day for the entire spot Bitcoin ETF sector. This single-day reversal is crucial for investors to understand. It demonstrates that demand for these products is not a one-way street. Therefore, monitoring these flow trends is essential for gauging broader institutional and retail interest in Bitcoin through regulated channels. Which ETFs Drove the $60.5 Million Exit? The outflows were concentrated, not widespread. Grayscale’s Mini BTC fund and Fidelity’s Wise Origin Bitcoin Fund (FBTC) were the main contributors to the negative total. Grayscale Mini BTC: This fund saw net outflows of $44.03 million. Fidelity FBTC: This fund experienced net outflows of $39.44 million. Meanwhile, BlackRock’s IBIT was the lone bright spot with its $28.72 million inflow. This divergence shows that even within the same asset class, investor preference can vary significantly between fund providers. How Should Investors Interpret This Volatility? Short-term flow data for spot Bitcoin ETFs can be noisy. A single day of outflows does not necessarily define a long-term trend. However, it serves as a powerful reminder of the market’s sensitivity. Several factors could influence these movements, including: Profit-taking by short-term traders after price increases. Broader macroeconomic concerns affecting risk appetite. Rotation of capital between different ETF providers based on fees or perceived stability. For long-term investors, the key is to look beyond daily fluctuations. The sustained presence of major financial institutions like BlackRock, Fidelity, and Grayscale in the spot Bitcoin ETF space signifies a profound shift in Bitcoin’s adoption journey. What’s the Future for Spot Bitcoin ETFs? The path forward will likely remain bumpy. The market for spot Bitcoin ETFs is still maturing, and days of outflows are to be expected alongside periods of strong inflows. This volatility is inherent to the underlying asset. Yet, the structural importance of these products is undeniable. They provide a secure, familiar, and regulated gateway for traditional investors to gain Bitcoin exposure. This institutional bridge is a cornerstone for the next phase of crypto adoption, even if the daily traffic across it fluctuates. In conclusion, the $60.5 million net outflow is a reality check. It underscores that the journey for spot Bitcoin ETFs and the broader crypto market will be marked by both advances and retreats. Savvy investors should view such data as a piece of a larger puzzle, not the final picture. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) What are spot Bitcoin ETFs? Spot Bitcoin ETFs are exchange-traded funds that hold actual Bitcoin. They allow investors to buy shares that track the price of Bitcoin without needing to directly purchase or store the cryptocurrency themselves. Why did spot Bitcoin ETFs have net outflows? Net outflows occur when the amount of money withdrawn from these ETFs exceeds the amount of new money invested. This can happen due to profit-taking, negative market sentiment, or investors moving capital to other assets. Is a single day of outflows a major concern? Not necessarily. While it indicates shifting short-term sentiment, one day of data does not define a long-term trend. It’s important to watch flow patterns over weeks and months for a clearer picture. How do spot Bitcoin ETF flows affect Bitcoin’s price? Large, sustained inflows can create buying pressure that may support or increase Bitcoin’s price. Conversely, large outflows can create selling pressure. However, many other factors also influence Bitcoin’s price. Should I avoid spot Bitcoin ETFs because of this volatility? Investment decisions should be based on your individual risk tolerance and long-term strategy. Spot Bitcoin ETFs are a volatile asset class. Their daily flows are one of many metrics to consider, not a sole reason to buy or sell. Which spot Bitcoin ETF had inflows on December 8th? BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) was the only major fund among those cited to record a net inflow on that day, attracting $28.72 million.

Each user will have a dedicated in-app digital-asset account that is managed by Hexarq rather than being routed to outside exchanges or third-party wallets. The arrangement keeps custody within the bank’s ecosystem. It also comes with a monthly fee of €2.99 and a trading commission of 1.5% on transactions. Banks Face Fintech Pressure Reports have pointed to the rise of fintech rivals as a driving reason for the move. Companies such as Revolut, Deblock, Bitstack and Trade Republic built early crypto offerings and attracted many retail users. Traditional lenders now risk losing younger customers unless they match those services. Some banks in Europe already offer in-app trading: BBVA supports Bitcoin and Ethereum, Openbank under Santander lists five cryptocurrencies, and Raiffeisen in Vienna provides similar features through a tie-up with Bitpanda. BPCE’s entry follows this trend and could push other big lenders to act.

On December 8th, US spot ETH ETFs collectively attracted $35.49 million in net inflows, signaling renewed institutional confidence in Ethereum-based investment products. This reversal marks a pivotal moment for digital asset funds. What Drove the US Spot ETH ETFs Inflow Surge? The data from TraderT reveals a clear leader in this recovery. BlackRock’s iShares Ethereum Trust (ETHA) dominated the inflows, securing $23.66 million. This substantial figure highlights continued strong demand for products from major traditional finance institutions. Meanwhile, Grayscale’s Ethereum Mini Trust contributed a solid $11.83 million to the total. The remaining US spot ETH ETFs in the market showed no net change, indicating the flows were concentrated in these two prominent funds. Why Does This Reversal Matter for Investors? This return to net inflows for US spot ETH ETFs is more than just a single day’s data point. It represents a potential shift in market sentiment. After a period of outflows, this influx of capital suggests that institutional investors may see current price levels as an attractive entry point. Furthermore, it demonstrates the growing maturity and resilience of cryptocurrency exchange-traded products. Consider these key implications: Sentiment Indicator: Net inflows often reflect positive investor outlook and confidence in the underlying asset’s future performance. Institutional Validation: Major players like BlackRock continuing to attract capital reinforces Ethereum’s position in diversified portfolios. Market Stability: Consistent interest in US spot ETH ETFs can contribute to overall market liquidity and stability. How Do US Spot ETH ETFs Compare to Broader Trends? The performance of US spot ETH ETFs does not exist in a vacuum. It interacts with broader cryptocurrency market movements, regulatory developments, and macroeconomic factors. This specific inflow event occurred amidst fluctuating Ethereum prices and ongoing discussions about blockchain network upgrades. Therefore, while a positive sign, investors should monitor these funds as part of a wider market context. The concentration of flows into just two of the available US spot ETH ETFs also tells a story. It points to a competitive landscape where brand recognition, fee structures, and liquidity are crucial differentiators for investors choosing where to allocate their capital. What’s Next for Ethereum ETF Investments? The December 8th data provides a hopeful snapshot. However, the true test will be whether this inflow trend sustains itself in the coming days and weeks. Market observers will watch closely to see if this marks the beginning of a longer-term accumulation phase for US spot ETH ETFs or remains a temporary rebound. For prospective investors, this activity underscores the importance of: Tracking daily flow data to gauge institutional momentum. Understanding the specific holdings and strategies of different US spot ETH ETFs. Considering how these investment vehicles fit within a broader, risk-managed crypto asset allocation. In conclusion, the $35.5 million net inflow is a powerful signal of returning confidence. It breaks a short-term negative trend and highlights the pivotal role major financial institutions now play in the digital asset ecosystem through products like US spot ETH ETFs. This movement suggests that sophisticated investors are actively engaging with Ethereum’s investment thesis, looking beyond short-term volatility. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) What are US spot ETH ETFs? US spot ETH ETFs are exchange-traded funds that hold actual Ethereum (ETH) cryptocurrency. They trade on traditional stock exchanges, allowing investors to gain exposure to ETH’s price without directly buying or storing the digital asset. Why did the inflows happen on December 8th? While specific triggers can be complex, inflows often correlate with perceived positive market developments, attractive pricing, or broader institutional investment cycles. The data shows a clear preference for funds from established managers like BlackRock and Grayscale. Is investing in a US spot ETH ETF a good idea? Like any investment, it depends on your individual financial goals, risk tolerance, and research. These ETFs offer a regulated way to access Ethereum but still carry the volatility associated with cryptocurrency markets. How can I track these ETF flows? Data from firms like TraderT, along with disclosures from the fund issuers themselves, provide regular updates on net inflows and outflows. Financial news websites often report on these figures. What’s the difference between ETHA and Grayscale’s Mini ETH Trust? Both are US spot ETH ETFs, but they may differ in management fees, structure, and size. BlackRock’s ETHA is a newer entrant, while Grayscale’s product is a conversion of a pre-existing trust, which can influence investor perception and flows. Could the inflow trend reverse again? Yes, ETF flows can and do change direction based on market conditions. The December 8th data is a single point, and sustained interest over time is a more reliable indicator of long-term sentiment.

Users can view live results and data, creating an unprecedented level of transparency in a field often shrouded in proprietary secrecy. The mechanism is elegantly simple yet powerful. Different open-source models, like Llama or Mistral variants, run the same tasks. Their performance—speed, accuracy, efficiency—is measured and posted on-chain. This creates a live leaderboard of technological capability, free from corporate marketing spin. How Can You Actually Invest in AI Models? This is where Delphi gets truly innovative. The platform allows users to place financial bets, or investments, on which models they believe will lead the performance rankings. It utilizes an LMSR-based (Logarithmic Market Scoring Rule) automated market maker (AMM). No Order Books: Unlike traditional exchanges, there’s no need to match buyers and sellers. You can enter or exit a position instantly. Direct Exposure: Your investment is a direct bet on a model’s technical merit, not the fortunes of a parent company. Performance-Based Rewards: If the model you back achieves a top ranking at the settlement period, you are rewarded. Your profit is tied directly to proven AI advancement. Therefore, Delphi creates a pure financial signal that reflects genuine technological progress, cutting through the noise of the AI hype cycle. Why is Transparent AI Performance Verification a Game-Changer? The current AI landscape is dominated by closed, proprietary models from giant corporations. Their inner workings and true capabilities are often opaque. Delphi challenges this paradigm by putting open-source models—the collaborative engines of innovation—on a public, verifiable stage. Gensyn states this creates a crucial opportunity. Instead of trying to pick winning AI stocks, you can now invest directly in the underlying, democratized technology. This does more than just create an investment vehicle; it aligns financial incentives with open-source development and rigorous, objective testing. What Are the Potential Impacts and Challenges? The potential here is staggering. A robust market for AI performance verification could accelerate the best open-source models by funneling capital and attention to them. It provides a clear, crowd-sourced answer to the question: “Which model actually works best?” However, challenges exist. The quality and relevance of the benchmarks are paramount; they must be fair and meaningful. Furthermore, the market’s success depends on widespread participation to ensure liquidity and accurate price discovery. Navigating the regulatory landscape for such a novel financial instrument will also be a key hurdle. Conclusion: A New Frontier for AI and Crypto Gensyn’s Delphi marketplace is a bold fusion of cryptocurrency mechanisms and artificial intelligence evaluation. By pioneering a trustless system for AI performance verification , it offers a revolutionary way to participate in the AI revolution. It empowers users to support the open-source ecosystem financially while creating a transparent, meritocratic arena where the best technology can rise to the top and be rewarded accordingly. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q: Do I need technical AI knowledge to use Delphi? A: Not necessarily. While understanding benchmarks helps, the platform is designed for any user to view performance rankings and make informed bets based on that public data. Q: What cryptocurrency do I need to participate? A: Specific details will depend on the blockchain Gensyn utilizes. Typically, you would need the native token of that network (like ETH for Ethereum) or a stablecoin to trade on the AMM. Q: How does this differ from buying tokens of an AI crypto project? A> Most AI crypto project tokens represent governance or utility within a specific protocol. A bet on Delphi is a direct financial derivative of a model’s performance score, not ownership of a project. Q: Are the benchmarks biased towards certain types of AI models? A: Gensyn has launched with its own general-purpose benchmark. The long-term health of the marketplace will depend on a diverse set of credible, community-vetted benchmarks for different AI tasks (e.g., image generation, coding). Q: What prevents manipulation of the model’s performance? A> The verification process is designed to be run in a secure, trustless manner. The exact technical details of how the benchmarks are executed and validated on-chain will be critical to the system’s integrity. Found this look at the future of AI investment fascinating?

Speaking before global regulators, banks, and market leaders, Zhou detailed how Bybit’s full UAE Virtual Asset Platform Operator (VAPO) license is reshaping the exchange’s global positioning and setting new standards for governance, infrastructure resilience, and institutional-grade market access. This new license places Bybit under one of the world’s most robust regulatory regimes, enabling the exchange to offer a complete institutional product stack from a rigorously supervised UAE hub. Vision Rooted in Trust, Scale, and Regulatory Alignment Zhou opened by emphasizing that institutional adoption is accelerating toward firms that can demonstrate both operational scale and regulatory certainty — and Bybit is now positioned to lead that shift. “Bybit’s growth this year reflects a market seeking reliability,” Zhou stated. “Asset inflows rose from USD 1.3 billion in Q3 to USD 2.88 billion in Q4, while our wealth management AUM expanded fivefold from USD 40 million to USD 200 million. Institutions want partners who can scale with discipline, transparency, and governance — and Bybit is delivering exactly that.” Zhou noted that Bybit’s strengthened regulatory status marks an inflection point for the industry. “The UAE’s VAPO license gives institutions what they have been waiting for — a regulatory environment where innovation is supported by rigorous oversight,” he added. “It anchors our compliance-first strategy and sets a model for how global digital finance will mature.” From Retail Strength to Institutional Certainty Zhou highlighted that Bybit’s institutional advantage is built on the strength of its global retail ecosystem — now spanning card, Pay, and fiat integration across 13 regions. This scale enables one of the deepest liquidity pools in the industry, providing measurable execution benefits to institutional desks. He also pointed to accelerated collaboration with major financial institutions in Europe and the Middle East, reinforcing Bybit’s role as a high-reliability execution venue for professional market participants. TradFi and Crypto: A Single Market Within Five Years Looking ahead, Zhou outlined his long-term view of the industry. Rather than parallel financial systems, he predicts a unified capital market driven by shared infrastructure standards, integrated workflows, and interoperable liquidity. “In the next five years, TradFi and crypto will not be two separate worlds,” Zhou said. “We are moving toward a single, globally connected ecosystem built on institutional-grade liquidity, custody, and infrastructure — and Bybit is building the operational backbone for that future.” Commitment to a Safer, High-Performance Institutional Market Zhou closed his keynote by underscoring Bybit’s commitment to create the market’s most trusted institutional trading ecosystem — anchored in transparency, execution speed, and clear regulatory standards. With its expanded regulatory footprint, deepening institutional partnerships, and rapidly scaling liquidity, Bybit is well positioned as a foundational pillar of the global digital asset market heading into an era of rapid institutional adoption in 2026. #Bybit / #CryptoArk About Bybit Bybit is the world’s second-largest cryptocurrency exchange by trading volume, serving a global community of over 70 million users.

The looming Fed decision on interest rates has created a holding pattern across major Asian currencies, injecting a dose of uncertainty into trading floors from Tokyo to Singapore. However, one currency has broken from the pack: the Australian dollar posted notable gains following the Reserve Bank of Australia’s latest policy announcement, providing a clear signal in an otherwise muted session. Why is the Forex Market in a Holding Pattern Ahead of the Fed? The primary force driving current market sentiment is the upcoming Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting. Traders and institutional investors are essentially parked on the sidelines, reluctant to make significant bets until they receive the latest guidance on U.S. monetary policy. The key questions everyone is asking: Will the Fed signal a pause, a pivot, or further hikes? What will the updated ‘dot plot’ reveal about the future path of rates? This uncertainty has a direct, stifling effect on currency volatility. Reduced Liquidity: Major players are reducing position sizes, leading to thinner trading conditions and exaggerated moves on any unexpected news. Dollar Dominance: The U.S. dollar’s strength often acts as a barometer for global risk sentiment. A hawkish Fed typically boosts the USD, putting pressure on emerging market and Asian currencies. Carry Trade Caution: Popular strategies that involve borrowing in low-yield currencies to invest in higher-yielding ones are being reassessed, impacting flows into Asian assets. The Australian Dollar Defies the Trend: Breaking Down the RBA Hold While most of Asia waited, the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) made its move. The decision to hold the cash rate steady at 4.35% was widely expected, but the accompanying statement and press conference delivered a hawkish undertone that fueled the Aussie dollar’s rally. RBA Key Signal Market Interpretation Impact on AUD/USD Commitment to return inflation to target No premature pivot; rates may stay higher for longer. Bullish Not ruling out further rate increases Door remains open for more tightening if needed. Bullish Acknowledgment of easing demand Policy is working, but the job isn’t finished. Neutral to Slightly Bullish The RBA’s stance contrasted with more dovish expectations that had been building. This surprise element provided the perfect catalyst for a short squeeze, pushing the AUD/USD pair firmly higher. The move highlights how central bank communication can be just as powerful as the policy decision itself in the forex market . How Are Other Major Asia FX Pairs Performing? The reaction across the region was one of general steadiness, but with underlying tensions. The Japanese Yen (JPY) remained under pressure, hovering near key levels that have prompted intervention warnings from Japanese officials in the past. The Chinese Yuan (CNY) was managed within a tight band by the People’s Bank of China (PBoC), reflecting a desire for stability ahead of the Fed. Southeast Asian currencies like the Thai Baht (THB) and Indonesian Rupiah (IDR) saw minimal movement, caught between local economic data and the overwhelming influence of the impending U.S. news. This creates a critical juncture for traders. The current Asia FX stability is fragile and likely a prelude to more significant volatility post-Fed. The direction of the next major move for these currencies will be largely dictated by the tone from Chair Jerome Powell and the FOMC. Actionable Insights for Navigating This Forex Market Environment In periods of high event risk, strategy is paramount. Here are key considerations: Manage Your Risk: Reduce leverage and position sizes ahead of the Fed announcement. Volatility can trigger rapid, gap moves that can quickly hit stop-loss orders. Watch the Reaction, Not Just the Action: The initial market move post-Fed can be deceptive. Focus on where currencies settle after the first hour of volatility—this often provides a truer direction. Correlation Awareness: Remember that a strong U.S. dollar reaction will have a ripple effect. If the USD surges, it’s likely to weigh on all Asia FX pairs, though commodity-linked currencies like the Australian dollar may show relative resilience. Conclusion: A Moment of Calm Before the Storm The apparent steadiness in Asia FX is a classic example of markets pausing to digest a potential seismic shift. The Fed decision is the week’s definitive event, capable of setting the tone for global currency markets for weeks to come. The standout performance of the Australian dollar following the RBA hold serves as a powerful reminder that local central bank narratives can create profitable divergence even during globally dominant themes. The forex market is now on high alert, with the calm of today poised to give way to the turbulence of tomorrow.

Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) What did the RBA decide at its latest meeting? The Reserve Bank of Australia ( RBA ) decided to hold its official cash rate steady at 4.35%. The accompanying statement was viewed as hawkish, signaling that the fight against inflation is not over. Who is the Chair of the U.S. Federal Reserve? The Chair of the Federal Reserve is Jerome Powell . His post-meeting press conference is closely watched by forex market participants for clues on future policy. Why is the Fed decision so important for Asian currencies? U.S. interest rate decisions directly influence the value of the U.S. dollar (USD). Since many Asian currencies trade heavily against the USD and global capital flows are sensitive to U.S. rates, the Fed’s actions have an outsized impact on Asia FX stability and direction. What is the ‘dot plot’ from the Fed? The ‘dot plot’ is a chart released by the Federal Reserve that summarizes the individual interest rate projections of FOMC members. It provides insight into where officials think rates are headed in the coming years, influencing long-term forex market expectations. Did other central banks in Asia meet this week? While the RBA was a key focus, other major Asian central banks like the Bank of Japan ( BOJ ) and the People’s Bank of China ( PBoC ) did not have scheduled policy meetings this week. Their actions are nonetheless constantly monitored by currency traders.

At the same time, Saylor’s company Strategy continued to expand its Bitcoin treasury after buying another $962.7 million worth of BTC even as its stock price fell more than 50% on the year. Despite market skepticism and concerns over liquidity risks in Bitcoin-based financial instruments, Strategy still maintains that its balance sheet is secure after raising $1.44 billion to reassure investors. Bitcoin Banking Could Attract Massive Capital Michael Saylor, CEO of the world’s largest Bitcoin-holding corporation, is urging nation-states to rethink their financial systems by building Bitcoin-backed digital banking products capable of drawing trillions in global capital. At the Bitcoin MENA conference in Abu Dhabi, Saylor argued that countries are missing a historic opportunity to offer high-yield, low-volatility digital accounts by leveraging overcollateralized Bitcoin reserves and tokenized credit instruments. These products, he said, could dramatically outperform the near-zero yields offered by traditional bank deposits in regions like Japan, Switzerland, and much of Europe. Even euro money-market funds deliver only around 150 basis points, while US money-market products hover near 400 basis points. Saylor believes that this yield stagnation forces investors into corporate bonds “that wouldn’t exist if people weren’t so disgusted with their bank account.” He described a digital banking structure in which roughly 80% of a fund consists of digital credit instruments, supported by 20% fiat currency and an additional 10% buffer to smooth volatility. With Bitcoin reserves overcollateralized at a 5:1 ratio and held by a treasury entity, such products could theoretically offer attractive returns while staying stable enough to operate in regulated banking systems. Saylor claimed that any country adopting this model could attract between $20 trillion and $50 trillion in deposits, and could turn into “the digital banking capital of the world.” His proposed banking model is similar to the structure of Strategy’s own STRC instrument, which was introduced in July as a money-market-style preferred share with a variable dividend around 10% and a design intended to keep its price near par. STRC has grown to roughly $2.9 billion in market cap, but critics are still wary of Bitcoin’s inherent volatility. BTC’s price action over the past year (Source: CoinMarketCap ) At around $90,010, Bitcoin is trading almost 30% below its October all-time high, and despite long-term gains of more than 1,100% over five years, its short-term swings still fuel skepticism. Former Salomon Brothers trader Josh Man argued that Bitcoin-backed high-yield products could face severe liquidity stress, and warned that raising rates to defend a peg may fail “when depositors want to get their money back out.” Strategy Keeps Buying Bitcoin Meanwhile, Michael Saylor’s Strategy expanded its already massive Bitcoin treasury by accumulating close to $1 billion worth of BTC even as inflows into digital asset treasuries slow and the company’s own stock faces steep declines. Saylor announced that Strategy bought 10,624 BTC for roughly $962.7 million at an average price of $90,615 per coin, bringing the firm’s total holdings to 660,624 BTC. Despite the downturn in Strategy’s share price, which fell 51% over the past year, the company is still in a strong unrealized profit position. Data from BitcoinTreasuries.NET estimates the value of Strategy’s holdings close to $60 billion, placing the firm more than 22% above its aggregate cost basis. Saylor continues to pitch Bitcoin as a transformative form of “digital capital,” a message he has been placing a lot of emphasis on during meetings with sovereign wealth funds, banks, family offices, and large-scale investors. He argues that Bitcoin now functions as digital gold and that a new category of “digital credit” can draw yield from this capital while reducing volatility. Despite concerns around the company’s ability to maintain obligations during major equity declines, Strategy repeatedly signaled confidence in its financial strength. CEO Phong Le recently pointed out that the firm raised $1.44 billion to counter market fear and ensure it could service debts and dividend commitments, pushing back against what he described as circulating FUD that encouraged short positions against Bitcoin. The company’s aggressive accumulation strategy contrasts with market trends. Digital asset treasuries saw their slowest month of inflows in November, and DefiLlama data showed that only $1.32 billion entered DAT products. This was a 34% decline from October. Despite this, Bitcoin-focused treasuries stayed dominant, bolstered by Strategy’s $835 million purchase on Nov. 17, while Ethereum-focused treasuries recorded $37 million in outflows.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|TRADING|DIGITAL ASSET TREASURY|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-12-09 05:30:00

Notably, this startup develops industrial robots utilizing research from the Italian Institute of Technology. This funding round was led by CDP Venture Capital, a company supported by the Italian government and operating through its Artificial Intelligence Fund. This information was made public following the release of Generative Bionics’s statement, shared by a reliable source. Some of the firms that participated in this round, apart from Tether, included AMD Ventures , the investment arm of the American chipmaker Advanced Micro Devices, and other industry investors. Tether aims to solidify its position as a leader with major investments in AI Tether’s investment marks another significant milestone in the company’s ongoing series of deals. Concerning its role in issuing the USDT stablecoin, sources acknowledged that stablecoins, cryptocurrencies that are typically connected to traditional currencies such as the dollar, have recently gained popularity, preferred by many as a suitable alternative method of payment. These sources also elaborated that this type of cryptocurrency usually relies on cash reserves and US government bonds issued on a short-term basis to maintain its value. Following this finding, Tether shared its forecast that the reserves supporting USDT will help it in attaining its target of generating approximately $15 billion in profit this year. The company made this prediction after noting high interest rates in the sector. Based in El Salvador , Tether has been utilizing these profits to expand its presence in various fields, including commodities, artificial intelligence, and sports. The firm also disclosed its growing interest in fields of AI and data. According to the Chief Executive Officer (CEO) of Tether, Paolo Ardoino, the Fintech company seeks to establish an internet where individuals possess authority over their own details. Meanwhile, apart from Generative Bionics, reports highlighted that the stablecoin issuer also backs Blackrock Neurotech, a pioneering medical device company that develops brain-computer interface (BCI) technology. Regarding Tether’s $81.6 million investment in Generative Bionics, sources familiar with the situation who wished to remain anonymous implied that under this deal, the Italian Humanoid-Robotics firm will hire engineers from the Italian Institute of Technology as it prepares for industrial use. The company will also utilize the funding to accelerate the development of its products and train its physical AI systems. This system is crucial as it integrates robotics with AI. In return, Generative Bionics’s robots effectively utilize tactile sensing, learning architectures, and human-robot interaction technologies in manufacturing, logistics, and other work settings. As competition in the AI ecosystem intensifies and demand for AI technology increases, the Italian Humanoid-Robotics firm has announced that it will showcase its first fully functioning humanoid robot at CES in Las Vegas this January. Tether explores commodities lending practices Last month, Tether announced its intention to increase its lending to commodities traders significantly . Ardoino claimed that th ey adopted the plan after these traders offered around $1.5 billion in credit to this market. During an interview, Tether’s CEO stated that the stablecoin issuer aims to enhance financing for trading in various commodities, including oil, cotton, wheat, and other agricultural goods, through this strategy. On the other hand, reports revealed that t he fintech company has also issued loans to its clients in both US dollars and its USDT stablecoin, which is pegged to the dollar. However, even with this move, Tether is still considered a smaller player compared to the leading banks participating in commodities lending. Nonetheless, sources mentioned that the firm has strong earnings potential resulting from its almost $200 billion in reserves. This, therefore, grants Tether the chance to compete effectively. “By using USDT for loans, Tether can also tap into a digital currency that is gaining popularity in commodity-exporting areas such as Latin America,” Ardoino said.

In a significant move for decentralized finance (DeFi) accessibility, the cross-chain protocol Across has announced its direct integration into the MetaMask wallet. This Across Protocol MetaMask integration empowers millions of users to swap and bridge assets across major networks directly from their trusted wallet interface, promising faster transactions and lower costs. What Does the Across Protocol and MetaMask Integration Actually Do? This partnership embeds Across’s routing technology directly into MetaMask’s built-in Swap and Bridge features. When you initiate a transfer, MetaMask’s system now automatically considers Across as one of the optimal paths. The integration supports moving assets between key networks like Ethereum, Solana, BNB Chain, Base, and Optimism. Therefore, you no longer need to visit a separate bridge website; the functionality lives right inside your wallet. Why is This a Game-Changer for DeFi Users? The primary benefits are speed, cost, and convenience. Cross-chain transactions have historically been slow and expensive. By leveraging Across’s optimistic verification model, this integration aims to slash both time and fees. Lower Costs: Across often provides more competitive rates by optimizing for capital efficiency. Faster Speeds: Some transfers can be completed in minutes instead of hours. Simplified Experience: Users stay within the familiar MetaMask environment, reducing steps and potential errors. This Across Protocol MetaMask integration effectively turns MetaMask into a more powerful hub for multi-chain activity. How Does This Strengthen Across’s Position in the Bridge Wars? The bridge market is fiercely competitive. Gaining direct access to MetaMask’s vast user base is a strategic masterstroke for Across. It provides unparalleled visibility and ease of adoption. The team stated this move will “expand user accessibility and strengthen competitiveness.” By being a default routing option, Across is positioned directly in front of users at their point of need, challenging other bridge providers. What Should Users Keep in Mind? While exciting, always practice caution in DeFi. Start with a small test transaction to verify the network, destination address, and fees. Double-check that you are using the official MetaMask extension or app to avoid phishing sites. Remember, the Across Protocol MetaMask integration is about routing; you are still interacting with smart contracts, so understand the inherent risks. Conclusion: A Step Toward a Unified Multi-Chain Future The collaboration between Across and MetaMask marks a pivotal step in smoothing out the fragmented blockchain landscape.

A new rival, Remittix (RTX) , is stepping into the same $700 billion remittance battlefield with a very different approach, and analysts are beginning to treat it as one of the best crypto 2025 contenders. Many now argue that if you are looking past short-term XRP swings and scanning for the best new altcoin or next 100x crypto, you cannot ignore this fast-growing DeFi project. XRP Price Prediction: Can Ripple Still Lead The Remittance Race? XRP sits near the $2 region after several days of heavy selling pressure, even while its ETFs keep attracting capital. The token has tried to bounce from the $2 support many times, but every rebound looks a little weaker, which keeps traders cautious. A clean break below $2 would pull the price back toward earlier base zones, while a strong daily close above $2.22 to $2.25 could open a path toward the $2.7 zone. Source: TradingView On the bullish side, some analysts say the current XRP price prediction still supports a possible reversal. They point to a potential double bottom pattern near $1.8 and note that ETF inflows remain positive. If buyers manage to push XRP above $2.22, the next price range sits around $2.7. Nevertheless, the majority of the optimistic argument hinges on regulatory statements, bank relationships, and the overall broadening of the investment risk, making investors question whether XRP really is the best crypto to invest in at the moment or merely one of several of the best altcoins to monitor. Why Remittix Stands Out In The $700 Billion Remittance Battlefield While XRP tries to plug into banks and institutions, RTX is building a direct crypto-to-fiat rail that lets everyday users send and receive money through a simple wallet and web app. On the numbers side, Remittix has already raised over $28.5 million by selling around 693 million RTX tokens at $0.119 each. The team has confirmed its first centralized exchange listings with BitMart and LBank and has teased another major CEX reveal in December. The Remittix Wallet is live, it is listed on the Apple Store , and the team is preparing its crypto-to-fiat Web App, which is close to completion. At the same time, RTX passed a full security audit by CertiK and achieved a Skynet score of 80.09, grade A, ranking it number one among pre-launch tokens and earning more than 24,000 community ratings. Analysts who compare XRP price prediction models with RTX growth often come back to fundamentals. Instead of meme cycles, Remittix leans on clear data points that fit what serious investors look for when they scan the market for the best new altcoin: Remittix focuses on real cross-border payments, targeting a $700 billion remittance sector instead of pure speculation. The token sits under $1 at $0.119, which gives room for upside and keeps RTX on many “top crypto under $1” watchlists. The project has working products today, including a live wallet on the Apple Store and a Web App payments beta on the way. Security and trust are central, with a full CertiK audit, an A-grade Skynet score, and a number one ranking among pre-launch tokens. Growth is backed by clear CEX plans, with BitMart and LBank confirmed, plus a larger listing reveal scheduled, rather than vague promises. Final Thoughts In summary, XRP still matters in any serious XRP price prediction debate. It has ETFs, liquidity, and a long track record, and a recovery toward higher bands remains possible if support holds and inflows continue. However, when analysts list the top altcoins to watch in 2026, many now place Remittix beside or even ahead of XRP in the remittance race. The combination of sub-1 dollar pricing, live wallet, upcoming payment Web App, strong security scores, and confirmed exchange listings makes RTX stand out as one of the best crypto 2025 narratives for real-world use. FAQs Can XRP reach $2.75? Many analysts believe that XRP’s price can skyrocket as long as it stays above $2 and passes $2.25. Reaching $2.7 is possible if whale accumulation continues and exchange balances keep falling, but it would need strong ETF demand and another major wave of institutional buying. What affects the price of XRP? XRP moves mainly on whale activity, supply changes on exchanges, and how much interest comes from traders and institutions during bigger market swings. If all of these are positive, XRP’s price reacts and increases. However, if they aren’t, the price could drop to even lower levels. What catalysts could push Remittix higher? Remittix has a solid roadmap that many experts believe could lead it to be the project leading the next rally. The App Store wallet rollout, the upcoming web app launch, the next major CEX listing in December, and the fact that the project is already backed by thousands of users all give Remittix strong momentum for a bigger move. Is it a good time to buy XRP? Before investing, it is important that you do enough research. The next price is dependent on whether XRP will remain above $2.22 because many analysts think that this is a strengthening coin. In case it does, XRP may go beyond $2.50 and beyond. Nevertheless, investors must conduct their research to make investments. What sectors are leading now?

Key Takeaways: ADGM now recognizes USDT across multiple major blockchains for regulated use. Tether says the move highlights stablecoins’ growing role in modern finance. The update comes as Binance also secures full ADGM authorization, boosting Abu Dhabi’s crypto ambitions. In a statement on Monday , Tether said ADGM now permits licensed institutions in the financial free zone to conduct regulated activities involving USDT across Aptos, Celo, Cosmos, Kaia, Near, Polkadot, Tezos, TON and TRON. These approvals expand on earlier recognition for USDT on Ethereum, Solana and Avalanche, broadening the stablecoin’s jurisdictional and technical reach across the region. ADGM Move Validates Stablecoins’ Financial Importance Paolo Ardoino, Tether’s CEO, said the move underscores the role of stablecoins in the modern financial system. “Introducing USDT within ADGM’s regulated digital asset framework reinforces the role of stablecoins as essential components of today’s financial landscape,” he said, adding that extending recognition across multiple chains helps strengthen Abu Dhabi’s standing as a hub for compliant digital finance. ADGM operates as a special economic zone and international financial center with its own legal, regulatory and judicial system. Its Financial Services Regulatory Authority (FSRA) oversees licensing and supervision for firms active within the jurisdiction. Under the newly issued recognition, ADGM-licensed entities can support USDT across nearly all major chains where the token circulates, creating a broader multichain foundation for settlement, trading and decentralized-application activity. Tether’s USD₮ Recognised as Accepted Fiat-Referenced Token in Abu Dhabi’s ADGM for Use on Several Major Blockchains Learn more: https://t.co/PKmF7w5aUx — Tether (@Tether_to) December 8, 2025 The announcement arrives as Abu Dhabi intensifies its campaign to attract global digital-asset firms. On the same day, Binance disclosed that it has secured full authorization to operate its flagship Binance.com platform under ADGM oversight, a milestone that comes after years of regulatory scrutiny. Binance will operate through three distinct legal entities in the zone, an exchange, a clearing house and a broker-dealer, reflecting a traditional financial-market structure designed to enable regulated trading, custody, settlement and off-exchange services. Co-CEO Richard Teng said the approval demonstrates Binance’s adherence to what he described as ADGM’s “gold-standard” regulatory expectations. Pending final operational steps, Binance.com is slated to begin regulated activity under the ADGM regime on Jan. 5, 2026, reinforcing the UAE capital’s strategy of pairing stringent oversight with an open stance toward digital-asset innovation. Tether Pushes Back as Arthur Hayes Flags Insolvency Risks As reported, Tether has faced renewed scrutiny after BitMEX founder Arthur Hayes warned that a 30% decline in the company’s Bitcoin and gold holdings could erase its equity. However, CoinShares’ James Butterfill rejected the alarm , noting that Tether holds more than $181 billion in reserves against $174.45 billion in liabilities, leaving a surplus of roughly $6.78 billion. His comments arrive amid broader market unrest tied to volatility in Japanese bonds and weak US labor data. CEO Paolo Ardoino also directly challenged Hayes’s claims, revealing that Tether Group’s total assets are closer to $215 billion, supported by around $7 billion in excess equity and an additional $23 billion in retained earnings. He emphasized that Bitcoin and gold make up only 12.6% of reserves, with more than 70% held in short-term US Treasuries. Ardoino accused critics of misreading the company’s attestation data, pointing to Tether’s roughly $500 million per month in interest income.

The regulator has officially stated that derivatives based on overseas cryptocurrency exchange-traded funds (ETFs) are not appropriate for the domestic market. This decision, rooted in a profound concern for investor safety, immediately reshapes the landscape for crypto investment products in one of the world’s most significant financial jurisdictions. For investors and firms eyeing the potential of crypto ETFs , this development demands close attention. What Did Japan’s FSA Actually Say About Crypto ETFs? The FSA clarified its position through a revised Q&A document on financial instruments. The core of their argument is straightforward: offering derivatives linked to overseas crypto ETFs to Japanese investors is unsuitable. Why? The agency points to a fundamental lack. There is no well-established system or regulatory environment in place to protect investors who engage with these complex products. Essentially, the FSA sees these instruments as sailing into uncharted and potentially dangerous waters without a proper safety net. The reaction from the market was swift and telling. IG Securities, a major brokerage, responded by suspending its offerings of Contracts for Difference (CFDs) based on U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs. This action is a direct consequence of the FSA’s guidance and serves as a clear signal to the entire industry. The message is unambiguous: Japan is drawing a firm line, and compliance is not optional. Why Is Japan Taking This Hard Stance on Derivatives? Japan has a long history of proactive and often conservative financial regulation, especially following past market scandals. The FSA’s primary mandate is to ensure market stability and protect consumers. When it comes to volatile assets like cryptocurrencies, layered with the complexity of derivatives, their caution intensifies. Let’s break down the key concerns driving this decision: Regulatory Gaps: Overseas crypto ETFs operate under foreign rules, which may not align with Japan’s stringent investor protection standards. Product Complexity: Derivatives like CFDs are inherently risky. Combining them with the volatility of crypto amplifies that risk exponentially. Market Integrity: The FSA likely worries about price discovery, transparency, and the potential for market manipulation in these cross-border products. Therefore, this isn’t just about saying ‘no’ to innovation. It’s a calculated move to prevent retail investors from exposure to what the regulator perceives as an unacceptable level of risk before proper safeguards are built. What Does This Mean for the Future of Crypto ETFs in Japan? The immediate implication is clear: Japan is unlikely to approve any crypto derivatives linked to overseas ETFs in the near future. This creates a significant barrier for global financial firms hoping to offer such products to Japanese clients. However, it’s crucial to view this within a broader context. This action does not necessarily mean Japan is closing the door on all crypto ETFs . The focus here is specifically on derivatives based on overseas funds. The development could potentially accelerate discussions around creating a domestic, fully-regulated framework for spot crypto ETFs. The FSA’s move underscores its preference for a controlled, home-grown ecosystem over reliance on external, less-supervised products. Key Takeaways for Investors and the Crypto Market Japan’s decision is a powerful reminder that the global path to crypto integration is not uniform. Regulatory approaches vary dramatically by region. For investors, this highlights the paramount importance of understanding the regulatory environment of any product they consider. For Japanese Investors: Access to leveraged or derivative products based on popular U.S. crypto ETFs will be severely restricted. Focus may shift to direct asset ownership or future domestic products. For the Global Industry: This sets a precedent. Other regulators with similar protective stances may follow Japan’s lead, creating a more fragmented global market for crypto-linked derivatives. The Big Picture: Regulation is advancing, but cautiously. Each step, even restrictive ones like this, is part of defining the long-term rules of the game for digital assets. In conclusion, Japan’s FSA has made a decisive and protective move. By deeming derivatives on overseas crypto ETFs inappropriate, it prioritizes systemic safety and investor security over rapid market expansion. This action forces a pause, compelling the industry to consider how to build more secure and transparent bridges between traditional finance and the crypto world. The journey continues, but the map is being redrawn with caution as a guiding principle. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What exactly did Japan’s FSA rule on? A1: Japan’s FSA stated that offering derivatives (like CFDs) based on cryptocurrency ETFs listed overseas is inappropriate for domestic investors due to insufficient investor protection frameworks. Q2: Does this ban all cryptocurrency ETFs in Japan? A2: No. The ruling specifically targets derivative products linked to overseas crypto ETFs. It does not directly ban spot crypto ETFs, especially potential future ones developed under Japanese regulation. Q3: What was the immediate market reaction? A3: IG Securities promptly suspended its CFD offerings tied to U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs, demonstrating immediate compliance with the FSA’s guidance. Q4: Why is Japan being so cautious? A4: Japan has a strong history of strict financial regulation aimed at consumer protection. The FSA is concerned about the high risk and lack of oversight for complex derivatives tied to volatile crypto assets from foreign jurisdictions. Q5: Can Japanese investors still buy U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs directly? A5: The FSA’s statement focuses on derivatives. The ability for Japanese residents to directly purchase shares of a U.S.-listed spot Bitcoin ETF would depend on their broker’s policies and other existing securities regulations, not this specific ruling. Q6: Will other countries follow Japan’s lead? A6: It’s possible. Regulators in other regions with similar conservative approaches to investor protection may see Japan’s move as a precedent, potentially leading to a more fragmented global regulatory landscape for crypto investment products.

The change would allow banks to handle trading and custody of a limited set of digital assets under tighter rules and monitoring. Banks Could Reopen Crypto Desks Under New Rules Reports have disclosed that the Banco Central de la República Argentina (BCRA) is reviewing a regulatory framework that would permit banks to provide crypto trading and custody, but only within a controlled, licensed setup. The move responds to heavy use of Bitcoin and stablecoins by many Argentines as a shield against peso weakness and inflation. Analysts say banks would likely need separate units, stronger custody systems and clear compliance checks before they can serve customers.

BREAKING: Argentina’s central bank is drafting rules to let banks offer crypto trading and custody, putting them in direct competition with exchanges under tighter KYC rules. Huge move for Argentina pic.twitter.com/RMz2icnC81 — Conor Kenny (@conorfkenny) December 8, 2025 That rule effectively prevented lenders from listing crypto products inside their apps or taking custody on behalf of clients. The ban pushed most retail activity toward registered Virtual Asset Service Providers (VASPs) and overseas platforms. What The New System Would Build On Based on reports, any shift would build on the country’s recent steps to regulate VASPs . The Comisión Nacional de Valores (CNV) has already issued registration criteria and AML/CFT requirements for local crypto firms, including technical rules on custody and “travel rule” compliance. Those existing rules are likely to form the baseline for the bank licensing regime, with extra safeguards for depositors and liquidity. How This Could Affect Users And The Market For everyday savers who turned to digital coins to protect savings, a bank-led service could mean easier access through familiar apps and possibly stronger institutional custody — though it would not erase price risk. Regulators are expected to insist on explicit risk disclosures and limits; client holdings in crypto would not automatically carry the same guarantees as insured bank deposits. Market players say initial offerings may focus on major assets such as Bitcoin and established stablecoins, rather than a wide array of tokens.

While institutional inflows into these products have accelerated, the number of active BTC addresses has declined. As Wall Street embraces BTC exposure, the network’s grassroots participation appears to be undergoing a significant transformation. In an X post, the CEO of SwanDesk, financial analyst Jacob King, pointed out that Bitcoin active addresses have been in a steady decline since the US spot BTC ETFs launched in January 2024, and the irony is obvious. Why Retail Participation Shows Signs Of Fatigue For years, BTC maximalists have pushed for Wall Street adoption, believing institutional involvement would unlock the next wave of mass usage. Instead, on-chain participation has dropped sharply as retail lost interest. Related Reading: US Fed Has Ended Quantitative Tightening, But Why Is The Bitcoin Price Still Below $100,000? King noted that these Bitcoiners have piled into the ETF for a quick, early FOMO bump, and then bailed, leaving behind a market where the asset is increasingly traded by proxy. According to King, ETF investing kills BTC’s core principles. While investors no longer hold or control their own assets as banks do, which is the very system BTC was designed to challenge, greed always beats ideology. Market watcher Crypto Seth has revealed that the net inflows into BlackRock and Fidelity’s spot BTC ETFs have been relatively subdued since October 10, when the largest liquidation events happened. Seth believes that this might turn into a momentum reversal soon, as the US stock market is at 1% below new highs despite retail sentiment remaining stuck in extreme fear. Seth also pointed out that the macro backdrop is shifting in BTC’s favor. This is because the Federal Reserve ended its Quantitative Tightening (QT) program on December 1, 2025, wrapping up a multi-year effort that shaved nearly $3 trillion from the balance sheet since 2022. Since the US Fed rate is still at 4.00%, more interest rate cuts are on the horizon, which is higher than both Europe and China. The BlackRock iShares BTC Trust (IBIT), which was launched in January 2024, is currently the firm’s most profitable exchange-traded fund (ETF) based on annual fee revenue, despite being less than two years old. Unlocking Bitcoin Without Compromising Its Core Principles Bitcoin is seeing key initiatives that improve its ecosystem. Every market cycle that has promise to unlock Bitcoin for decentralized finance (DeFi), RioSwap is one of the few products built on infrastructure that was capable of unlocking it in a truly decentralized way. Related Reading: Bitcoin Aims Higher as Bulls Regain Strength and Push for Resistance Break According to Mintlayer, this was powered by Mintlayer’s native HTLC architecture, as RioSwap introduces a Decentralized Exchange (DEX) that allows BTC to move directly into decentralized markets without wrapping, unbridging, and is fully in the user’s control. With the RioSwap testnet now live, Mintlayer sees this as the start of a new liquidity phase for BTC where the asset will become an active participant in the decentralized market on its own terms.

Over the past year, a net total of 403,200 BTC has moved off centralized trading platforms, representing a 2.1% reduction in the entire supply held on exchanges, according to the report. In general, this is a positive long-term sign, according to Santiment. “The less coins that exist on exchanges, the less likely we’ve historically seen a major sell-off that causes downside pressure for an asset’s price.” Exchange Outflows Are Bullish Investors usually take coins off exchanges to hodl or custody, which is bullish. They send them to exchanges in preparation for selling, which is bearish. Around 14.7% of the total Bitcoin supply is currently held on exchanges, according to Glassnode. This has been in decline since mid-2022, when almost 18% was held on exchanges. As Bitcoin’s market value hovers around $90K, crypto’s top market cap continues to see its supply moving away from exchanges.

Back to Bitcoin, analysts believe that the bottom is strengthening, which could lead to a rebound. The OBV (On-Balance Volume) chart is a lot cleaner than the price, said analyst Sykodelic on Tuesday. “It is both holding and moving stronger than the price … which shows us the buying is far stronger than the selling.” Meanwhile, fellow analyst “Daan” said Bitcoin was “stalling while its bull market support band is closing in.” Analyst “Colin” was also bearish, identifying a bear flag continuation pattern, “which means a move down would be the expected outcome.” If such a move down did occur, $74,000 to $77,000 would be the likeliest bottom, he said. Short-term Pain Remains It appears that Colin may have been onto something, as Bitcoin had lost the $90,000 level again at the time of writing. The asset had lost 1.4% on the day and was trading at $89,862, but remained within its weekly range-bound channel. Bitcoin has struggled to break through resistance at $92,000. It appears that this week’s Federal Reserve rate cut is already priced in , so it is unlikely to get a boost from that, and down appears to be the path of least resistance.

Here’s the Latest,https://timestabloid.com/xrp-just-made-history-in-the-united-states-heres-the-latest/,"Crypto analyst BullRunners highlighted what he described as a historic moment for XRP, pointing to Bitnomial’s regulatory filings and approvals that establish the foundation for a fully supervised U.S. trading environment. The documents he shared include the Commodity Futures Trading Commission’s Order of Registration for Bitnomial Clearinghouse LLC as a derivatives clearing organization and the exchange’s formal self-certification to list an XRP-referenced U.S. dollar futures contract. Together, they show the steps taken to bring XRP into a regulated framework recognized under U.S. derivatives law. The Order of Registration confirms that Bitnomial met the compliance standards required for clearing operations. The self-certification, dated August 9, 2024, outlines the exchange’s intent to introduce a physically settled XRP futures contract, designated XUS, with an initial trade date no earlier than August 13, 2024. The filing also situates the contract within Bitnomial’s published rulebook and clearing procedures. $XRP MAKES HISTORY WITH THE FIRST U.S. REGULATED LISTING! #XRP #XRPCommunity pic.twitter.com/3g3qo3bjEf — BULLRUNNERS (@BullrunnersHQ) December 8, 2025 Advantages of the regulated structure The filings indicate that XRP will be supported inside a market that operates under full CFTC supervision. Bitnomial, as both a registered exchange and clearinghouse, is obligated to meet federal requirements for surveillance, reporting, operational integrity, and ongoing audits. This establishes a transparent and disciplined environment that aligns XRP with protections already applied to traditional U.S. derivatives products. For XRP, this marks a shift from fragmented or offshore venues into a domain that adheres to established federal standards. The proposed XRP/USD spot structure, functioning within this supervised framework, places the asset under the same regulatory expectations that govern other U.S. financial instruments. It provides a regulated foundation that strengthens market credibility and offers clearer safeguards for participants. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Institutional relevance and broader market impact One of the most significant implications of this development is the institutional access it enables. Many banks, hedge funds, and asset managers are restricted from interacting with unregulated platforms due to strict internal compliance rules. The presence of a regulated XRP market eliminates this constraint, allowing institutions to participate through an exchange that satisfies federal custody, transparency, and operational requirements. This creates a compliant pathway for larger capital pools seeking structured exposure to digital assets. A regulated spot environment also lays the groundwork for more advanced financial products. Instruments such as options, structured notes, and settlement tools rely on dependable pricing and secure market infrastructure. Bitnomial already incorporates XRP and RLUSD into its margin systems, indicating the technical readiness to support additional structures as the market evolves. The filings shared by BullRunners show that the core regulatory and operational components for these developments are now in place.

You’re not alone. A seismic shift is underway in the crypto landscape, as Bitcoin exchange reserves have experienced a dramatic year-over-year decline of over 400,000 BTC. This massive outflow from centralized platforms signals a profound change in investor behavior and market structure. Let’s unpack what this means for the future of Bitcoin’s price and the broader adoption narrative. What Does the Drop in Bitcoin Exchange Reserves Actually Mean? Data from analytics firm Santiment reveals a clear trend: investors are pulling their Bitcoin off exchanges. This movement of over 400,000 BTC—worth tens of billions of dollars—is more than just a statistic. It represents a fundamental shift from short-term trading to long-term holding. When Bitcoin sits on an exchange, it’s often seen as ‘for sale.’ Its removal suggests investors are opting for self-custody, viewing their BTC as a store of value to be secured privately, not a quick-trade asset. Santiment analysts note this decline can signal an easing of long-term selling pressure. Simply put, less Bitcoin readily available on exchanges means less potential supply to hit the market during sell-offs. This trend has persisted even as Bitcoin’s price trades robustly around the $90,000 level, indicating conviction beyond mere price speculation. Where is the Bitcoin Going? The Rise of ETFs and Institutional Holdings If Bitcoin is leaving exchanges, where is it heading? The answer highlights two powerful, parallel trends shaping the market. Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs): Data from sources like Bitbo shows U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs now hold a staggering 1.5 million BTC. These financial products allow traditional investors to gain exposure without directly managing keys, absorbing a huge portion of the available supply. Public Companies & Institutions: Major corporations and funds now hold over one million BTC in their treasuries. This institutional adoption treats Bitcoin as a strategic reserve asset, similar to gold. Combined, these two groups control approximately 11% of Bitcoin’s total 21 million supply. This institutional wall is a primary driver sucking liquidity from exchanges and into long-term cold storage. Why Are Investors Pulling Bitcoin Off Exchanges? The exodus from centralized platforms isn’t random. It’s driven by clear, rational motivations that every crypto holder should understand. Security & Self-Sovereignty: The mantra ‘not your keys, not your coins’ has never been more relevant. High-profile exchange failures have taught investors the risks of third-party custody. Long-Term ‘HODL’ Mentality: The market is maturing. Many buyers now intend to hold for years, not days. Moving coins to a private wallet is the logical step for this strategy. Anticipation of Future Scarcity: With the next Bitcoin halving reducing new supply and institutional demand rising, investors are positioning for potential future price appreciation by securing their coins now. What Are the Implications for Bitcoin’s Price and Market Health? This drain on Bitcoin exchange reserves creates a fundamentally different supply dynamic. A lower liquid supply on trading venues can lead to increased price volatility, but often to the upside. When demand meets limited available sell-side liquidity, prices can move sharply. This environment potentially reduces the severity of prolonged bear markets, as the ‘weak hands’ have already moved their coins off exchanges. However, it also presents a challenge for new entrants. As Bitcoin becomes harder to source from exchanges without moving the price, the role of ETFs as a liquidity conduit becomes even more critical for mainstream adoption. Actionable Insights for Crypto Investors What should you do in response to this market shift? Consider these points. Evaluate Your Custody Strategy: If you’re holding long-term, research secure self-custody solutions like hardware wallets. Understand Market Liquidity: Recognize that large buy or sell orders on exchanges may have a bigger price impact than before. Monitor the Data: Keep an eye on exchange reserve metrics as a key indicator of overall market sentiment and potential selling pressure. In conclusion, the staggering 400,000 BTC drop in Bitcoin exchange reserves is a powerful vote of confidence in Bitcoin’s long-term value. It marks the maturation of the market from a speculative trading arena to an ecosystem where institutional adoption and personal sovereignty are paramount. This supply squeeze, driven by ETFs and corporate treasuries, lays the groundwork for a new era of Bitcoin economics defined by scarcity and institutional validation. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q: Why is a drop in Bitcoin exchange reserves considered bullish? A: It’s considered bullish because it reduces the immediate selling pressure on the market. Bitcoin held in private wallets or institutional custody is less likely to be sold impulsively, creating a scarcer liquid supply for trading. Q: Does this mean I should immediately move all my Bitcoin off an exchange? A: It depends on your goals. If you are actively trading, you need some funds on an exchange. If you are a long-term holder, moving the majority to a secure private wallet is a prudent strategy for security and peace of mind. Q: How do Bitcoin ETFs affect exchange reserves? A: ETFs purchase massive amounts of Bitcoin, often directly from exchanges or OTC desks. This process permanently removes that Bitcoin from the exchange’s available supply, as the ETF custodian holds it in deep cold storage. Q: What is the risk of everyone moving Bitcoin off exchanges? A: The primary risk is reduced liquidity, which can lead to higher volatility and wider bid-ask spreads, making large trades more expensive to execute. It also centralizes trading activity among fewer participants. Q: Where can I track Bitcoin exchange reserve data? A: Several analytics platforms like Glassnode, CryptoQuant, and Santiment provide real-time and historical data on exchange balances, allowing you to monitor these trends yourself.

This strategic license from the Abu Dhabi Global Market’s regulatory authority marks a significant expansion for digital dollar services in a key financial region. Let’s explore what this means for the future of crypto payments. What Does Circle’s Abu Dhabi License Actually Mean? The Financial Services Regulatory Authority (FSRA) of the Abu Dhabi Global Market (ADGM) has granted Circle permission to operate as a licensed Money Services Business. This isn’t just a minor regulatory checkbox. It’s a formal endorsement that allows Circle to offer regulated, institutional-grade financial services from within the ADGM, a leading international financial free zone. Consequently, Circle can now legally provide services like wholesale payments, cross-border settlements, and custody related to USDC directly to businesses and financial institutions in the region. This move effectively bridges traditional Middle Eastern finance with the efficiency of blockchain-based digital dollars. Why is the Circle Abu Dhabi License a Major Deal? This development is more than corporate news. It represents a strategic pivot. The Middle East, particularly the UAE, has positioned itself as a progressive hub for digital assets. By obtaining this Circle Abu Dhabi license , the company gains a trusted foothold in a market eager for innovation. The benefits are substantial: Regulatory Clarity: Businesses in the region can now partner with a fully licensed entity, reducing compliance risk. Faster Settlements: Using USDC for B2B payments can slash transaction times from days to seconds. Market Access: It opens the door for regional institutions to integrate digital dollar transactions seamlessly. Therefore, this license acts as a key that unlocks institutional adoption, providing a compliant on-ramp for traditional capital into the digital asset ecosystem. How Will This Shape the Future of USDC and Crypto Payments? Circle’s immediate plan involves expanding its suite of services anchored around USDC. Think of large-scale, business-to-business (B2B) payments, treasury management, and cross-border trade settlements. The Circle Abu Dhabi license provides the legal framework to make these services a daily reality for corporations in the MENA region. Imagine a manufacturer in Dubai paying a supplier in Singapore instantly with USDC, avoiding traditional banking delays and fees. This license makes that scenario not just possible, but regulated and secure. It signals that major stablecoins are evolving from speculative trading instruments into core infrastructure for global commerce. What Are the Broader Implications for Crypto Regulation? Abu Dhabi’s ADGM is known for its robust yet forward-thinking regulatory framework. By granting this license, the FSRA is sending a clear message: it supports the responsible integration of blockchain technology into the mainstream financial system. This move could encourage other jurisdictions to develop clear licensing paths for credible crypto enterprises. However, the challenge remains for companies to meet the high compliance standards expected by such regulators. Circle’s success here sets a precedent, proving that major crypto players can operate within strict regulatory perimeters while driving innovation. Conclusion: A Strategic Step for Global Crypto Finance Circle securing its Abu Dhabi financial services license is a pivotal moment. It transcends a single company’s expansion and highlights a growing trend of strategic convergence between leading crypto firms and progressive financial hubs. This development strengthens USDC’s utility as a digital dollar for institutional use and accelerates the maturation of the entire cryptocurrency market in a key economic corridor. The bridge between traditional and digital finance just got a major new pillar. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What exactly is the license Circle received in Abu Dhabi? A1: Circle received a Financial Services Permission (FSP) from the ADGM’s Financial Services Regulatory Authority (FSRA). This licenses them as a Money Services Business, allowing them to offer regulated digital asset services. Q2: How does this benefit users or businesses? A2: Businesses in the region gain access to fast, low-cost, and regulated B2B payments and settlements using USDC, with the assurance of dealing with a fully licensed entity. Q3: Does this mean Circle can now issue USDC from Abu Dhabi? A3: The license primarily allows Circle to provide payment and settlement services using USDC. The stablecoin itself remains a digital dollar issued on multiple blockchains. Q4: Why did Circle choose Abu Dhabi for this expansion? A4: Abu Dhabi’s ADGM offers a clear, reputable regulatory framework for fintech and digital assets, making it an ideal strategic hub for expanding into the Middle East and surrounding markets. Q5: Will this affect the price or stability of USDC? A5: Not directly. The license pertains to service expansion, not the monetary policy of USDC, which remains 1:1 backed by cash and short-term U.S. Treasuries. Q6: Can individual investors in the UAE now use Circle’s services more easily? A6: The license focuses on institutional and business-to-business (B2B) services. Retail access may come later but is not the immediate goal of this regulatory milestone. Found this insight into Circle’s strategic move valuable?

Key Takeaways: Circle obtained an ADGM license to operate USDC services under full regulatory oversight. The approval strengthens Abu Dhabi’s push to become a global hub for regulated digital assets. Circle appointed Dr. Saeeda Jaffar to lead regional expansion and drive USDC adoption. The approval allows Circle to operate as a fully regulated Money Services Provider within the UAE’s capital market free zone, the company said in a Tuesday’s press release . Circle Gains Full Regulatory Entry Into UAE’s Fast-Growing Crypto Hub The license grants Circle the ability to offer regulated payment, settlement, and digital-asset services tied to USDC, giving the company a formal operating presence inside one of the world’s fastest-growing hubs for compliant crypto activity. The move comes as the UAE continues to position itself as a global center for digital-asset regulation, with ADGM leading efforts to attract firms seeking clear rules for fiat-referenced tokens and tokenized financial services. As part of its expansion, Circle appointed Dr. Saeeda Jaffar as Managing Director for the Middle East and Africa. Dr. Jaffar, currently a senior executive at Visa overseeing the GCC region, will join Circle to guide its strategy, build regional partnerships, and push for broader adoption of USDC in business payments and financial infrastructure across the UAE and beyond. Circle expands its regulatory footprint in the UAE Announced at Abu Dhabi Finance Week: → Secured an @ADGlobalMarket FSRA Financial Services Permission to operate as a Money Services Provider This milestone builds on USDC and EURC being the first stablecoins recognized by… pic.twitter.com/BCSDOpo3mb — Circle (@circle) December 9, 2025 “Regulatory clarity is the foundation of a more open and efficient internet financial system. We are honored to work with the FSRA in ADGM,” Circle co-founder and CEO Jeremy Allaire said. With the license in hand, Circle plans to expand regulated USDC use in corporate payments, settlement rails and developer infrastructure across the region. The announcement also follows Dubai’s earlier recognition of USDC and EURC under the DFSA’s crypto token regime, giving Circle regulatory footing across both of the UAE’s major financial zones. Stablecoins have also surged in mainstream adoption since President Donald Trump signed the GENIUS Act into law in July , establishing a federal framework for their issuance and oversight. The law’s passage triggered a wave of new stablecoin initiatives from major financial institutions, including Bank of America , Morgan Stanley, and Robinhood. Tether, Binance Secure Regulatory Approval in ADGM As reported, Tether’s USDT stablecoin has also secured regulatory recognition as an approved fiat-referenced token across a wide range of blockchains inside the ADGM. Tether said ADGM now permits licensed institutions in the financial free zone to conduct regulated activities involving USDT across Aptos, Celo, Cosmos, Kaia, Near, Polkadot, Tezos, TON and TRON. These approvals expand on earlier recognition for USDT on Ethereum, Solana and Avalanche. On Monday, Binance disclosed that it has also secured full authorization to operate its flagship Binance.com platform under ADGM oversight, a milestone that comes after years of regulatory scrutiny. Binance will operate through three distinct legal entities in the zone, an exchange, a clearing house and a broker-dealer, reflecting a traditional financial-market structure designed to enable regulated trading, custody, settlement and off-exchange services.
