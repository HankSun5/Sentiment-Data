This crypto market downturn has been attributed to multiple factors including heightened geopolitical tensions in the Middle East and rising liquidations of long positions. While Ethereum has experienced some rebound in the last day gaining by 3.21%, investors remain uncertain of a full price recovery with bearish sentiments raving through the market. Notably, an Ethereum ICO participant has now sold off a substantial amount of ETH intensifying concerns of a prolonged downward trend.

So far, the address has been identified as an early Ethereum investor who acquired 150,000 ETH valued at $368 million in the asset’s initial coin offering (ICO) in 2014. Data from Lookonchain highlights this is the second ETH sale by “0xBF4” in the last week after the ICO participant initially sold 19,000 ETH, valued at $47.54 million over Wednesday and Thursday. Notably, this ETH whale has transferred out 40,000 ETH worth $101 million since September 22, holding a balance of 99,500 ETH valued at $238 million. Generally, massive token offloads by large holders e.g. whales are interpreted as bearish signals as they indicate a lack of confidence in the asset’s long-term profitability. Sales such as those seen from “0xBF4” may trigger a panic selling from smaller investors inducing a stronger downward pressure on Ethereum’s price. Related Reading: Crypto Capo Returns After 2 Months To Predict Ethereum Decline To $1,800, Is It Time To Go Long? 108,000 ETH Moved To Exchanges In 24 Hours Aside from the wallet address “0xBF4”, other investors have recently sold off large amounts of ETH. According to analyst Ali Martinez, 108,000 ETH valued at $259.2 million have been transferred to exchanges in the last day. This massive sale activity indicates a heightened sentiment in the ETH market. Currently, Ethereum trades at $2,399 following its recent price rally. However, its daily trading volume has declined by 17.48% and is valued at $14.61 billion. If bearish sentiments persist, ETH could retrace to around $2,200 at which lies its next significant price level. However, amidst massive selling pressure, the altcoin could trade as low as $1,600. With a market cap of $291.40 billion, Ethereum continues to rank as the second largest cryptocurrency, with a market dominance of 13.47%.

Such supply cuts sometimes point to a bullish trend. The people in the SHIB community seem to rally for this cause, hoping to juice up the price of the token.

Investors are feeling optimistic as a result of this level of activity. From the initial supply, 410.73 trillion SHIB tokens have so far been destroyed. The amount of tokens in circulation, at 583.51 trillion, is still substantial. The SHIB community is still upbeat that the meme coin will exceed expectations and perform well in the upcoming weeks, or months. Santana’s assessment indicates that the present weak market, particularly the growing turmoil in the Middle East, may cause some disruptions. However, investors shouldn’t worry too much as cryptocurrencies can sometimes bring big surprises. Many people are keeping a close watch on this since the Shiba Inu community is working together to limit the supply. Does the price appreciation for SHIB have anything to do with the current rush to burn? Investors hold their breath and hope for a breakout as the year 2025 approaches.

Many are eagerly anticipating Chainlink to surge during this cycle and finally reclaim new all-time highs. The extended consolidation phase has kept traders on edge, as they await a significant breakout. Related Reading: XRP Price Bullish Potential Grows – A Surge Above $0.65 Will Trigger Buyers Renowned crypto analyst Lucky has shared an insightful prediction regarding Chainlink’s potential trajectory. According to Lucky, the key lies in LINK breaking above its current consolidation range, which would set the stage for a strong upward move. He suggests that once this breakout occurs, Chainlink could quickly surge toward a short-term target of $15. With bullish sentiment building around this major resistance level, Chainlink’s price action in the coming days could be crucial in determining its direction. Investors are closely monitoring the market, watching for signals that LINK is ready to break free from its long-standing range and enter a new phase of growth. Chainlink Price Action Turning Bullish Chainlink’s price action has been largely bearish since hitting its yearly high in March, with the asset now stuck in a prolonged consolidation phase. However, many analysts believe this consolidation could be nearing its end. One top analyst, Lucky, has recently shared a bullish technical analysis on X, offering an optimistic outlook for Chainlink. Lucky’s analysis reveals that LINK is trading within a falling wedge pattern, a formation often associated with potential bullish reversals. According to his chart, Chainlink has touched the lower boundary of this wedge three times, signaling strong support, and now appears to be gearing up for a breakout from its yearly consolidation range. He predicts that this breakout could happen as early as October, potentially triggering a surge in LINK’s price. Related Reading: Solana (SOL) Holds Above $140 As Funding Rate Signals Bullish Momentum Lucky has set several bullish price targets once Chainlink breaks out of this consolidation phase. The first target is $15, followed by more ambitious targets at $19 and $22. These price levels would represent significant gains from Chainlink’s current price and mark a strong recovery from the bearish trend that has dominated most of 2024. With bullish patterns emerging, investors are closely watching for Chainlink’s next move, anticipating that a major breakout could propel LINK toward these optimistic price targets. Technical Analysis: Key Prices To Watch Chainlink (LINK) is currently trading at $11.09 and is testing a key resistance level, the 4-hour 200 moving average (MA) at $11.10, after a 7% surge since Thursday. This level has become a significant hurdle for bulls, as the price has struggled to break above the indicator. For the bullish momentum to continue, LINK must push past this indicator and aim for higher supply zones around $13. However, the current price action suggests that bulls are finding it difficult to gain strength at this critical level. Should LINK fail to break above $11.10 and reclaim the higher resistance, a correction may follow. In that scenario, the price could dip to a lower demand zone, with the next key support level at $9.2. Related Reading: Can SUI Break Past $2 Resistance? On-Chain Metrics Reveal Growing Demand The coming days will likely determine whether LINK can maintain its upward trajectory or see a pullback in price. A successful breakout above the 4-hour 200 MA could signal further gains, while failing to do so may result in a bearish correction.

The general consensus is that Bitcoin is going bullish in October, although different analysts have varying outlooks as to how this will happen. Taking to his social media account, Inmortal noted that the only prerequisite for a new Bitcoin all-time high is for the price to break above $64,000. According to an accompanying Bitcoin/TetherUS chart, this price level is situated just above the October monthly open. This means a sustained break above $64,000 would nonetheless translate to a green monthly close in October. Breakout above 64k = New ATH$BTC pic.twitter.com/mUvDN5sTyi — Inmortal (@inmortalcrypto) October 4, 2024 Interestingly, Inmortal had noted in an earlier X post that Bitcoin’s drop from $66,000 on September to $60,000 on October 2nd feels like the flagship digital asset has reached a local bottom. This is because Bitcoin seemed to retest this level three times before eventually rebounding upwards. However, he did clarify that this is only based on a hunch because there is no market structure break or confirmation yet. Interestingly, this local bottom sentiment is supported by analysis from a CryptoQuant analyst known as “caueconomy.” Inmortal further emphasized that he is currently only interested in taking long positions on Bitcoin, and he has identified two specific entry points for these trades. The first opportunity would arise if Bitcoin retests the $60,000 low, providing a potential buying window at a key support level. The second entry point, according to his analysis, would be triggered by a breakout above the $63,000 price level. What’s Next For Bitcoin? At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading at $62,200 and has already gained 3.5% from the October 3 low. However, the flagship cryptocurrency is still down by 5.7% in seven days and there remains the possibility of a break to the downside in the short term.

Specifically, he anticipates that Bitcoin could dip to around the $57,000 to $58,000 range, testing support in that area before ultimately reversing course and going higher for the rest of the month of October and after the US election in early November.

However, while the BTC market experienced an uptick on Friday as data from the US Labor Department indicated incoming rate cuts, investors have generally retained a cautionary approach. Related Reading: Analyst Says Bitcoin Crash Might Not Be Over, Why $60,365 Is Important Bitcoin Fear And Greed Index Touches 37 As Investors Become Uncertain In a Quicktake post on CryptoQuant, an analyst with username maartunn shared that the Bitcoin Fear and Greed Index currently signals fear following the asset’s recent price slump The Fear and Greed Index generally measures the emotions, moods, and behaviors of the crypto market as well as predicts potential trends based on investor sentiment. The index operates on a 0-100 scale, where values above 50 indicate greed, with anything over 74 representing extreme greed, while values below 50 signal fear, and under 24, extreme fear. According to maartunn, the Fear and Greed Index is presently at 37, indicating that many investors are cautious about adding the leading cryptocurrency to their portfolio. In particular, the analyst notes that each time the Fear and Greed Index reached the fear level since 2023, Bitcoin’s price has formed a bottom, i.e. reached the lowest point during a price decline, and is set for price reversal. Notably, Bitcoin already showed an upward movement on Friday after starting October with a price decline. However, it cannot be said that the price bottom has now occurred as Bitcoin’s daily chart shows the asset is still far above its next significant support level following months of consolidation between $55,000 – 70,000. Although, if the premier cryptocurrency has bottomed out, it could be heading for a price breakout in line with popular expectations for a bullish “uptober”. For context, October has proven to be the most frequent bullish month for Bitcoin resulting in an average gain of 22.90% in the last 11 years. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Dip Explained: Key Causes And Where To Expect A Bounce Back To $70,000 Dominant Activity Of Stablecoins Supports Fear And Uncertainty Among Investors In addition to the Bitcoin Fear and Greed Index of 37, the crypto market has also experienced an increase in market activity of stablecoins namely the Tether USD (USDT) and USD Coin (USDC). This development indicates that investors are opting for less volatile assets than risky coins such as Bitcoin, which is often due to uncertainty and fear of impending price crash. CryptoQuant analyst BaroVirtual has attributed this fear to several factors including weak retail market participation, rising geopolitical tensions in the Middle East, as well as the SEC’s hesitation to launch a Spot Ethereum ETF Options. At the time of writing, Bitcoin continues to exchange hands at 62,071 following a 2.17% gain in the last day. Meanwhile, the token’s daily trading volume is down 17.91% and valued at $29.71 billion.

This breakout signals a powerful bullish momentum, prompting a re-evaluation of the asset’s potential for further gains. As the market reacts to this significant price movement, understanding the underlying technical factors and market dynamics is crucial for forecasting future price action. In this technical breakdown, we will analyze the recent surge of POPCAT past its previous all-time high of $1.0094, focusing on the technical indicators and market conditions that have contributed to this breakout. By examining key support and resistance levels, as well as the potential for a continued bullish trajectory, we will assess the implications of this price action for traders and investors. Additionally, the article will explore potential scenarios for POPCAT’s price movement, providing insights into what to expect in the coming days and how market sentiment may influence future trends. Analyzing Technical Indicators After New Peak On the 4-hour chart, POPCAT has demonstrated impressive bullish momentum, breaking above both the 100-day Simple Moving Average (SMA) and its previous all-time high of $1.0094. Reaching a new all-time high marks a critical milestone for the meme coin, as it validates the positive trend and opens the door for potential new highs. An analysis of the 4-hour Relative Strength Index (RSI) reveals a renewed upward potential, as the RSI has climbed back to 68% after dipping to 45%. This upward shift indicates increasing buying pressure. If the RSI continues on this trajectory, it could signal more upside movements for POPCAT, paving the way for new highs, and reinforcing the bullish trend. Related Reading: POPCAT Jumps 20% As Whales Load Their Bags, Is A ‘Cat Season’ Ahead? Furthermore, the meme coin has fully positioned itself above the daily 100-day SMA, indicating a strong positive pressure after surpassing its all-time high of $1.0094. As the price breaks through previous resistance levels, it attracts more buyers, enhancing the likelihood of a sustained uptick and fortifying the overall optimistic outlook for POPCAT in the near term. Also, the RSI on the daily chart is currently at 74%, having previously dropped to 59%. An elevated RSI level implies that POPCAT is in overbought territory, reflecting strong buying pressure and heightened enthusiasm in the market. While such high readings may signal potential exhaustion in upbeat momentum, the lack of immediate indications for a pullback shows that bullish sentiment remains strong. Support And Resistance Levels: Navigating The New Terrain For POPCAT Support Levels: The immediate support level to watch is the $1.0094 mark, which may act as a psychological level for buyers. Should it fall below this range, the next significant support could be found around the $0.80 mark, serving as a strong base for possible rebounds.

BITO is down significantly since my last article, but I remain bullish, albeit for different reasons. Technical indicators suggest a potential end to BITO's downtrend, with bullish seasonality from October to February historically supporting Bitcoin price increases. BITO is a high-risk, high-reward investment suitable for those bullish on Bitcoin, offering potential income and brokerage account accessibility. About six months ago, I called the ProShares Bitcoin ETF ( BITO ) a strong buy ahead of the Bitcoin halving that would take place a couple of weeks later. As it turns out, the post-halving run up in Bitcoin prices I was looking for didn’t materialize. Indeed, Bitcoin has been consolidating for months now, frustrating bulls at every rally attempt. That has kept a lid on the price of BITO, obviously, but as we reexamine it now, I’m not so sure price will be held down much longer. Obviously, I said BITO was a buy at $31, and we’re now at $17. That’s not amazing. However, in the intervening time, BITO has declared and paid $9.84 in distributions per share. Putting that context in makes the 44% decline since my article a true decline of about 17%. Still not great, but much better. It also highlights a key component of BITO, which we’ll cover below. At any rate, I think seasonality makes BITO a buy here, along with an improving technical picture that may just portend the end of the current downtrend. A refresher on BITO I covered the composition of BITO in depth in the linked article from April, so I won’t go through everything again. However, a brief primer on BITO is that it’s an ETF that owns Bitcoin futures, but not actual Bitcoin. Fund website We can see there’s no multi-month strategy as we see with some commodity ETFs; BITO owns a single contract, which happens to be the October 25 th , 2024 expiry (in addition to a nominal amount of index swaps). Basically, this fund owns a huge amount of Bitcoin futures contracts, so its correlation to spot Bitcoin pricing is good, but not perfect. StockCharts.com We can see the 50-day correlation to Bitcoin spot prices is 0.83, so it’s far from perfect. But BITO offers the ease of owning Bitcoin through a normal brokerage account, as well as distributions each month. For that, you are “paying” for a small amount of tracking error. If that sort of thing bothers you, BITO isn’t for you. In the context of the benefits of BITO against trying to own actual Bitcoin, it may be worth it for some investors. Downtrend ending? That’s the key question here. The pennant I pointed out in April ultimately failed, as the ETF did not break out to new highs. The pennant failed in mid-April, ushering in what has become a protracted downtrend. So the key question then becomes, how do we know the downtrend has ended? StockCharts.com The series of lower highs is obviously the key indicator of a downtrend, and it won’t be complete until we start getting higher highs. I will say that from the August low, we’ve seen support hold in a mini uptrend. The ETF is now in excess of the major moving averages, and the PPO has crested the centerline. These are good signs, but we have to have confirmation through higher highs. The RSI is also still not confirming the downtrend having ended. During consolidation or bearish phases, the 14-day RSI rarely crests 60. You can see during this past six months, there have been at least eight attempts for the RSI to move over 60, and all eight have failed. Seeing a reading of 65+ would be a great indicator a new rally has started. Another point for the bulls is that seasonality is outstanding this time of year. This is a decade’s worth of data on Bitcoin's seasonality, and the period from October to February is tremendously bullish. StockCharts.com October to February, a period of five months, has averaged 48% absolute gains. To be clear, I’m not saying Bitcoin is going to go up 48% in the next five months, but I am saying that betting against Bitcoin during this period is a tough trade to make on the evidence above. Risks and distributions Obviously, a fund that tracks Bitcoin is one that is going to have a lot of risk, and BITO is no different. Seeking Alpha It achieves a risk grade of F via Seeking Alpha’s metrics, as all relevant metrics receive poor scores. Annualized volatility, for example, is more than four times that of the S&P 500. It’s obviously extremely concentrated as well, given it tracks a single instrument. Point being, if you are risk-averse, BITO is not for you. If you are bullish on Bitcoin pricing, it’s one way to gain exposure, but positions should be sized prudently given the inherent risk here. The other very interesting thing here are the distributions the fund pays are extremely significant. Seeking Alpha I mentioned the distributions in the introduction, and you can see just how big they’ve been this year. The $10.93 per share that’s been paid is equal to 62% of the current fund price. You can use such distributions as monthly income, or you can reinvest. But the point being that you cannot talk about BITO without talking about distributions. You can read about how BITO generates funds for its distributions but basically, the gains made by the fund on futures contracts or swaps get turned into net income, which is then distributed. Given that, the distribution varies widely from month to month, and in some months, there may be no distribution at all. For now, BITO is paying huge monthly distributions. The bottom line BITO is obviously a high-risk, high-reward situation as it pertains to gaining exposure to Bitcoin. The OG alt-coin is volatile on its own, and BITO introduces additional risk through tracking error. However, gaining access to Bitcoin in a general brokerage account, as well as the potential income it generates makes up for that, in my view. You may disagree, and that would mean BITO simply isn’t for you. However, with bullish seasonality in the coming months, as well as early signs of technical improvement on the price chart, I’m sticking with my bullish call on BITO.",BITO,EN,0,0,BTC|TRADING|MARKET|TOKEN SALE|BUSINESS,"{'name': 'Seeking Alpha', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/seekingalpha.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",seekingalpha,2024-10-06 03:50:46

Despite this trend, on-chain data analytics provider CryptoQuant has revealed a significant increase in BTC buying momentum, resulting in the Bitcoin balances on various exchanges dropping to six-year lows. Related Reading: Injective (INJ) Down 20% As Market Retracement Forces Sell-Off Bitcoin Reserve On Exchanges Sees Sharp Plunge With ongoing market volatility and the recent decline in Bitcoin, on-chain data has identified a significant shift in the cryptocurrency’s market activity. CryptoQuant’s data has revealed a substantial decline in the total amount of Bitcoin held by various Centralized Exchanges (CEXs) in the market. As of October 2, the Bitcoin balance of centralized exchanges, according to Coinglass, sat at 2.34 million, marking the lowest number in six years. This sharp decline contrasts with the 3.05 million Bitcoin held on exchanges in January this year, highlighting a significant reduction in available supply in just a few months. Typically a low Bitcoin balance on centralized exchanges could be an indication of an impending price appreciation, as fewer BTC available on these platforms can create upward pressure on its price due to the limited supply. The reduction in Bitcoin reserves could also be signaling a shift in investor sentiment from selling to accumulating. Following Bitcoin’s price drop to around $60,000, various exchanges experienced mass withdrawals from investors. In one of its QuickTake blogs, CryptoQuant described this large-scale withdrawal as “the largest outflow of Bitcoin from exchanges since November 2022.” This development also follows the recent increase in Bitcoin accumulation by whales and a rise in the demand for Spot Bitcoin Exchange Traded Funds (ETFs). Additional information from CryptoQuant reveals that institutional investors moved from net selling 5,000 BTC on September 2 to buying 7,000 BTC by the end of the month. This represents the highest daily purchase of Spot Bitcoin ETFs since July 21. #Bitcoin demand from US spot ETFs is rising. They went from net selling 5K $BTC on Sept 2 to buying 7K BTC at September’s end—the highest since July 21. In Q1 2024, spot ETFs bought nearly 9K #BTC daily, boosting prices to new highs. If this trend continues, prices may rise… pic.twitter.com/6EQ9JXUzdw — CryptoQuant.com (@cryptoquant_com) October 4, 2024 Moreover, in the first quarter of 2024, Spot ETFs were reportedly buying nearly 9,000 BTC daily, boosting prices to new levels. CryptoQuant also disclosed that if this increase in demand continues, the price of Bitcoin may appreciate further. Analyst Stays Bullish On BTC, Predicts $100,000 Surge A popular crypto analyst, known as ‘The Bitcoin Therapist’ on X (formerly Twitter) has uncovered a massive bull flag in Bitcoin’s price chart. The analyst revealed that this bull flag had formed over the last seven months, signaling a potential for a price increase in the future.

Notably, the premier cryptocurrency has slipped into a minor consolidation state since the little gains recorded on Friday. However, for long-term traders, Bitcoin has remained in a range-bound movement stretching to March. And while many investors are highly expectant of a bullish breakout in Q4 2024, certain market conditions must be met.

Bitcoin MVRV, CQ Bull & Bear Indicators Show Market Uneasiness In a Quicktake post on CryptoQuant, an analyst with username burakkesmeci shares that the Bitcoin market is currently set for key price movements. Based on the MVRV Ratio and CQ Bull & Bear metric, burakkesmeci notes that Bitcoin investors are presently showing a significant level of market anticipation. For context, the MVRV Ratio compares the current price of Bitcoin to its realized value i.e. the price at which the asset last moved on-chain. It is generally used to indicate if Bitcoin is undervalued or overvalued relative to its realized value. When the MVRV ratio crosses above its 365-day Simple Moving Average (SMA 365), it indicates a bullish trend as investors are seeing a year-to-date gain on their assets. However, burakkesmeci notes that Bitcoin’s MVRV currently at 1.90 has been hovering just below its SMA 365 (2.03) since July showing the BTC market remains in a steady position waiting for a breakout. The analyst has also observed a similar pattern in the CQ Bull & Bear indicator which measures recent price action relative to longer-term price movements. According to burrakesmeci, the CQ Bull & Bear metric has been oscillating slightly below its SMA 365 (0.46) since August enforcing the notion that the Bitcoin market is in a holding pattern. Related Reading: Bitcoin Investors Show Fear – Could A Price Bottom Be Imminent? Factors That Will Spark A Bitcoin Rally For Bitcoin to experience a bullish breakout from its current holding position, burakkesmeci highlights certain events that must occur. First, he notes that the Federal Reserve must fully engage in a rate-cut cycle, gradually lowering interest rates over time. Interestingly, following a 50 basis points cut in September, market experts are tipping the Fed to implement another 25% cut at their next FOMC meeting in November. Another bullish factor highlighted by burakkesmeci is an impending quantitative easing which will see the US government inject liquidity into the economy. It is expected that higher liquidity will allow individuals to explore risky investments such as Bitcoin. At the time of writing, Bitcoin trades at $62,009 with a 0.02% loss in the past 24 hours. Meanwhile, the asset’s daily trading volume is down by 53.80% and valued at $12.97 billion.

Following the Federal Reserve’s interest rate cut announcement, Solana surged 26% but quickly retraced 17%, reflecting the ongoing turbulence in the broader crypto market. This rollercoaster price movement has left many investors on edge as they wait for the next clear signal. Related Reading: Can SUI Fall To $1.40? On-Chain Data Exposes Declining Demand Amidst this uncertainty, top analysts are closely monitoring Solana’s next move, with one in particular pointing to the $160 mark as the decisive level that could determine its direction. A breakout above this level could reignite bullish momentum, while failure to do so may lead to further downside pressure. The coming days will be critical for Solana as investors assess the market’s trajectory and brace for potential volatility. With SOL standing at a pivotal point, both bulls and bears are watching closely to see whether the price can break through key resistance or succumb to further correction. Solana Testing Liquidity Below $160 Solana has experienced significant ups and downs over the past couple of weeks, leaving investors uncertain after the latest dip. Many were anticipating further gains before the retrace, which has now sparked caution in the market. With Solana trading in this volatile environment, the focus has shifted to key technical levels that could determine the next big move. Top crypto analyst Daan has shared his insights on X, noting that Solana has formed three nearly equal highs around the $160 level. He also highlights that SOL is consistently making higher lows, a sign of potential bullish momentum building up. According to Daan, this gradual upward drift suggests that Solana could eventually break through the $160 resistance level, which would be a pivotal moment for the cryptocurrency. Related Reading: Chainlink (LINK) Bullish Pattern Could Ignite A Breakout: Analyst Sets $15 Target The reaction at $160 will be crucial. If Solana manages to break above this level, it could signal a push to new highs and reignite bullish sentiment in the market. However, if the price fails to maintain momentum, Solana might remain range-bound between $120 and $160, continuing its sideways movement. Investors are closely watching these levels as Solana’s next direction could define its performance for the rest of the year. Price Action: Supply Levels To Break Solana (SOL) is currently trading at $143 after experiencing a few days of choppy price action. The market has been volatile, and SOL is now testing the critical 4-hour 200 exponential moving average (EMA) at $144.55. This level serves as a key resistance point, and a breakout above it could signal a bullish continuation for Solana. If SOL manages to break and hold above the 4-hour 200 EMA, the next target for bulls would likely be the $160 level. A move above $160 could reignite positive sentiment, potentially setting the stage for further gains. However, if SOL fails to break above the $144.55 resistance, a retrace to lower demand zones is expected. Related Reading: XRP Price Bullish Potential Grows – A Surge Above $0.65 Will Trigger Buyers In the event of rejection at the 4-hour 200 EMA, Solana could dip to the $127 support level, where traders and investors will closely monitor for signs of strength or further downside risk. The price action over the next few days will be crucial in determining whether SOL can resume its bullish trajectory or if a deeper retracement is on the horizon.

This development occurred in tandem with Bitcoin’s bearish start to October in which it declined over 6% in the first five days of the month. Related Reading: US Spot Bitcoin ETFs Become Second-Largest Holder Of BTC Behind Satoshi Spot Bitcoin ETFs Negative Outflows End Three-Week Positive Streak According to data from market tracking platform SoSoValue, the US-based spot Bitcoin ETFs registered a cumulative net outflow of $301.54 million in the first week of Q4 2024, ending a three-week run of positive returns. Following a net inflow of $61.30 million on September 30, these investment funds quickly transitioned into a bearish state as Bitcoin’s value fell sharply amid rising geopolitical tensions in the Middle East. This led to three consecutive days of cumulative negative outflows totaling $388.42 million. On Friday, October 4, the spot BTC ETFs returned to a positive trajectory recording gains of $25.59 million but proved largely insufficient in overturning the earlier deficit. However, despite this negative weekly performance, the spot Bitcoin ETFs are still primed to attract massive levels of investments in this quarter in line with the lofty price expectations for Bitcoin. Notably, these investment funds have produced a speculative performance following their launch in January. According to data shared by analyst Quinten Francois, the spot BTC ETFs occupy the top four positions of successful ETF launches in 2024. With a Bitcoin bull run on the horizon, these exchange-traded products are certain to receive more interest from institutional investors in the coming weeks. Currently, the spot BTC ETFs boast a cumulative total net inflow of $18.50 billion with total net assets valued at $57.73 billion thus representing 4.68% of the Bitcoin circulating supply. BlackRock’s IBIT maintains market dominance with total investments of $22.91 billion while Grayscale’s GBTC and Fidelity’s FBTC account for significant market holdings with net assets of $13.75 billion and $11.09 billion, respectively.

In contrast to their Bitcoin counterparts, the ETH spot ETFs have had a challenging debut with total net outflows of 553.66 million. However, they account for 2.28% of the Ethereum market supply with $6.6 billion in total net assets. At the time of writing, Bitcoin trades at $62,062, with Ethereum valued at $2,414.

The premier cryptocurrency continues to hover around the $62,000 mark, reflecting a mere 0.3% decline in the last 24 hours. Recent on-chain data suggests that the price of Bitcoin might continue to turn in a sluggish performance, as short-term holders remain under pressure. Specifically, the market leader continues to trade under the realized price of short-term holders (STH). What Does This Mean For Bitcoin Price? In a recent post on the X platform, crypto analyst Ali Martinez revealed $63,000 as the realized price for Bitcoin short-term holders, explaining the relevance of this level to the asset’s long-term health. For context, the short-term holder realized price is a metric that measures the average price at which short-term investors purchased their BTC. Related Reading: Bitcoin Futures Liquidation Forms Local Price Bottom — A Return To $65,000 Inevitable? When the spot value of Bitcoin is higher than the short-term holders’ realized price, it indicates that most recent investors are in the green. Typically, this encourages the traders to buy more coins, precipitating a positive market sentiment and potentially triggering an upward price movement. On the other hand, a fall beneath the STH realized price implies that most short-term holders are in unrealized loss. In this scenario, some investors may look to cut their losses by offloading their holdings, leading to downward pressure on price and further sell-offs. According to Martinez, Bitcoin has been trading beneath the short-term holders’ realized price since June. With the current STH realized price at $63,000, the premier cryptocurrency appears to be at risk of further decline, especially in the short term. BTC Holder Behavior Similar To 2016 And 2020 The overall outlook for Bitcoin’s price in the last quarter of 2024 has been quite positive. CryptoQuant revealed in its latest weekly report that the behavior of Bitcoin holders in the current cycle mirrors the 2016 and 2020 halving years, indicating a potential price growth for the market leader. Related Reading: Similarities Between October 2023 And 2024 Suggests The Bitcoin Price May Still Experience ‘Uptober’ The on-chain analytics firm highlighted that the short-term Bitcoin supply increased following the launch of spot exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in early 2024. Although a cooling period followed after this spike, CryptoQuant pointed out that another rise in short-term supply could occur — if historical trends hold.
