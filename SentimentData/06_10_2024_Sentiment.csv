This crypto market downturn has been attributed to multiple factors including heightened geopolitical tensions in the Middle East and rising liquidations of long positions. While Ethereum has experienced some rebound in the last day gaining by 3.21%, investors remain uncertain of a full price recovery with bearish sentiments raving through the market. Notably, an Ethereum ICO participant has now sold off a substantial amount of ETH intensifying concerns of a prolonged downward trend.

So far, the address has been identified as an early Ethereum investor who acquired 150,000 ETH valued at $368 million in the asset’s initial coin offering (ICO) in 2014. Data from Lookonchain highlights this is the second ETH sale by “0xBF4” in the last week after the ICO participant initially sold 19,000 ETH, valued at $47.54 million over Wednesday and Thursday. Notably, this ETH whale has transferred out 40,000 ETH worth $101 million since September 22, holding a balance of 99,500 ETH valued at $238 million. Generally, massive token offloads by large holders e.g. whales are interpreted as bearish signals as they indicate a lack of confidence in the asset’s long-term profitability. Sales such as those seen from “0xBF4” may trigger a panic selling from smaller investors inducing a stronger downward pressure on Ethereum’s price. Related Reading: Crypto Capo Returns After 2 Months To Predict Ethereum Decline To $1,800, Is It Time To Go Long? 108,000 ETH Moved To Exchanges In 24 Hours Aside from the wallet address “0xBF4”, other investors have recently sold off large amounts of ETH. According to analyst Ali Martinez, 108,000 ETH valued at $259.2 million have been transferred to exchanges in the last day. This massive sale activity indicates a heightened sentiment in the ETH market. Currently, Ethereum trades at $2,399 following its recent price rally. However, its daily trading volume has declined by 17.48% and is valued at $14.61 billion. If bearish sentiments persist, ETH could retrace to around $2,200 at which lies its next significant price level. However, amidst massive selling pressure, the altcoin could trade as low as $1,600. With a market cap of $291.40 billion, Ethereum continues to rank as the second largest cryptocurrency, with a market dominance of 13.47%.

Such supply cuts sometimes point to a bullish trend. The people in the SHIB community seem to rally for this cause, hoping to juice up the price of the token.

Investors are feeling optimistic as a result of this level of activity. From the initial supply, 410.73 trillion SHIB tokens have so far been destroyed. The amount of tokens in circulation, at 583.51 trillion, is still substantial. The SHIB community is still upbeat that the meme coin will exceed expectations and perform well in the upcoming weeks, or months. Santana’s assessment indicates that the present weak market, particularly the growing turmoil in the Middle East, may cause some disruptions. However, investors shouldn’t worry too much as cryptocurrencies can sometimes bring big surprises. Many people are keeping a close watch on this since the Shiba Inu community is working together to limit the supply. Does the price appreciation for SHIB have anything to do with the current rush to burn? Investors hold their breath and hope for a breakout as the year 2025 approaches.

Many are eagerly anticipating Chainlink to surge during this cycle and finally reclaim new all-time highs. The extended consolidation phase has kept traders on edge, as they await a significant breakout. Related Reading: XRP Price Bullish Potential Grows – A Surge Above $0.65 Will Trigger Buyers Renowned crypto analyst Lucky has shared an insightful prediction regarding Chainlink’s potential trajectory. According to Lucky, the key lies in LINK breaking above its current consolidation range, which would set the stage for a strong upward move. He suggests that once this breakout occurs, Chainlink could quickly surge toward a short-term target of $15. With bullish sentiment building around this major resistance level, Chainlink’s price action in the coming days could be crucial in determining its direction. Investors are closely monitoring the market, watching for signals that LINK is ready to break free from its long-standing range and enter a new phase of growth. Chainlink Price Action Turning Bullish Chainlink’s price action has been largely bearish since hitting its yearly high in March, with the asset now stuck in a prolonged consolidation phase. However, many analysts believe this consolidation could be nearing its end. One top analyst, Lucky, has recently shared a bullish technical analysis on X, offering an optimistic outlook for Chainlink. Lucky’s analysis reveals that LINK is trading within a falling wedge pattern, a formation often associated with potential bullish reversals. According to his chart, Chainlink has touched the lower boundary of this wedge three times, signaling strong support, and now appears to be gearing up for a breakout from its yearly consolidation range. He predicts that this breakout could happen as early as October, potentially triggering a surge in LINK’s price. Related Reading: Solana (SOL) Holds Above $140 As Funding Rate Signals Bullish Momentum Lucky has set several bullish price targets once Chainlink breaks out of this consolidation phase. The first target is $15, followed by more ambitious targets at $19 and $22. These price levels would represent significant gains from Chainlink’s current price and mark a strong recovery from the bearish trend that has dominated most of 2024. With bullish patterns emerging, investors are closely watching for Chainlink’s next move, anticipating that a major breakout could propel LINK toward these optimistic price targets. Technical Analysis: Key Prices To Watch Chainlink (LINK) is currently trading at $11.09 and is testing a key resistance level, the 4-hour 200 moving average (MA) at $11.10, after a 7% surge since Thursday. This level has become a significant hurdle for bulls, as the price has struggled to break above the indicator. For the bullish momentum to continue, LINK must push past this indicator and aim for higher supply zones around $13. However, the current price action suggests that bulls are finding it difficult to gain strength at this critical level. Should LINK fail to break above $11.10 and reclaim the higher resistance, a correction may follow. In that scenario, the price could dip to a lower demand zone, with the next key support level at $9.2. Related Reading: Can SUI Break Past $2 Resistance? On-Chain Metrics Reveal Growing Demand The coming days will likely determine whether LINK can maintain its upward trajectory or see a pullback in price. A successful breakout above the 4-hour 200 MA could signal further gains, while failing to do so may result in a bearish correction.

This recovery comes amid renewed optimism in the crypto space, as traders and investors remain hopeful for a solid finish to the year. In a recent post on social media platform X, popular crypto analyst Inmortal revealed Bitcoin is still on its way to creating a new all-time high very soon. The only thing the bulls need to do is to ensure a break above the $64,000 price tag. Related Reading: Market Signals Hint At Bitcoin’s Potential Fall To $52,000—Analyst Bitcoin New All-Time High Coming Soon? The general consensus is that Bitcoin is going bullish in October, although different analysts have varying outlooks as to how this will happen. Taking to his social media account, Inmortal noted that the only prerequisite for a new Bitcoin all-time high is for the price to break above $64,000. According to an accompanying Bitcoin/TetherUS chart, this price level is situated just above the October monthly open. This means a sustained break above $64,000 would nonetheless translate to a green monthly close in October. Breakout above 64k = New ATH$BTC pic.twitter.com/mUvDN5sTyi — Inmortal (@inmortalcrypto) October 4, 2024 Interestingly, Inmortal had noted in an earlier X post that Bitcoin’s drop from $66,000 on September to $60,000 on October 2nd feels like the flagship digital asset has reached a local bottom. This is because Bitcoin seemed to retest this level three times before eventually rebounding upwards. However, he did clarify that this is only based on a hunch because there is no market structure break or confirmation yet. Interestingly, this local bottom sentiment is supported by analysis from a CryptoQuant analyst known as “caueconomy.” Inmortal further emphasized that he is currently only interested in taking long positions on Bitcoin, and he has identified two specific entry points for these trades. The first opportunity would arise if Bitcoin retests the $60,000 low, providing a potential buying window at a key support level. The second entry point, according to his analysis, would be triggered by a breakout above the $63,000 price level. What’s Next For Bitcoin? At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading at $62,200 and has already gained 3.5% from the October 3 low. However, the flagship cryptocurrency is still down by 5.7% in seven days and there remains the possibility of a break to the downside in the short term.

Specifically, he anticipates that Bitcoin could dip to around the $57,000 to $58,000 range, testing support in that area before ultimately reversing course and going higher for the rest of the month of October and after the US election in early November.

However, while the BTC market experienced an uptick on Friday as data from the US Labor Department indicated incoming rate cuts, investors have generally retained a cautionary approach. Related Reading: Analyst Says Bitcoin Crash Might Not Be Over, Why $60,365 Is Important Bitcoin Fear And Greed Index Touches 37 As Investors Become Uncertain In a Quicktake post on CryptoQuant, an analyst with username maartunn shared that the Bitcoin Fear and Greed Index currently signals fear following the asset’s recent price slump The Fear and Greed Index generally measures the emotions, moods, and behaviors of the crypto market as well as predicts potential trends based on investor sentiment. The index operates on a 0-100 scale, where values above 50 indicate greed, with anything over 74 representing extreme greed, while values below 50 signal fear, and under 24, extreme fear. According to maartunn, the Fear and Greed Index is presently at 37, indicating that many investors are cautious about adding the leading cryptocurrency to their portfolio. In particular, the analyst notes that each time the Fear and Greed Index reached the fear level since 2023, Bitcoin’s price has formed a bottom, i.e. reached the lowest point during a price decline, and is set for price reversal. Notably, Bitcoin already showed an upward movement on Friday after starting October with a price decline. However, it cannot be said that the price bottom has now occurred as Bitcoin’s daily chart shows the asset is still far above its next significant support level following months of consolidation between $55,000 – 70,000. Although, if the premier cryptocurrency has bottomed out, it could be heading for a price breakout in line with popular expectations for a bullish “uptober”. For context, October has proven to be the most frequent bullish month for Bitcoin resulting in an average gain of 22.90% in the last 11 years.

This development indicates that investors are opting for less volatile assets than risky coins such as Bitcoin, which is often due to uncertainty and fear of impending price crash. CryptoQuant analyst BaroVirtual has attributed this fear to several factors including weak retail market participation, rising geopolitical tensions in the Middle East, as well as the SEC’s hesitation to launch a Spot Ethereum ETF Options. At the time of writing, Bitcoin continues to exchange hands at 62,071 following a 2.17% gain in the last day. Meanwhile, the token’s daily trading volume is down 17.91% and valued at $29.71 billion.
