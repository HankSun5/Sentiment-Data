This isn’t science fiction; it’s a real proposal put forward by U.S. Congressman Lance Gooden. This move signals a growing push for integrating cryptocurrencies into more mainstream, and even official, spaces, potentially accelerating Cryptocurrency Adoption in the United States. Why Put Crypto ATMs in Government Spaces? Texas Representative Lance Gooden has formally urged the General Services Administration (GSA), the agency responsible for managing federal properties, to seriously consider the installation of Crypto ATMs within federal buildings. His rationale extends beyond mere convenience. The proposal aligns with a broader, more positive stance towards digital assets advocated by figures like former President Trump, suggesting a political undercurrent to this technological push. Gooden’s argument centers on several key benefits: Innovation Showcase: Placing crypto ATMs could demonstrate the U.S. government’s willingness to embrace financial technology innovation and Blockchain Technology . Identity Verification: Reputable crypto ATM operators often incorporate robust Know Your Customer (KYC) and Anti-Money Laundering (AML) protocols, potentially offering a secure method for transactions with verified identities. Transaction Transparency: While often perceived as anonymous, blockchain transactions are inherently transparent on the public ledger, offering a traceable record for regulatory purposes. This proposal aims to normalize the use of digital assets by making them accessible in familiar, official locations, potentially fostering greater trust and encouraging wider Cryptocurrency Adoption among the general public. Navigating the Waters of US Crypto Regulation While the vision of accessible crypto in federal buildings is compelling, the reality is complex, especially concerning US Crypto Regulation . The cryptocurrency landscape in the U.S. is currently fragmented, with various federal and state agencies asserting jurisdiction. The regulatory environment for Crypto ATMs specifically has been a point of concern. CoinDesk reported that Gooden’s proposal comes amid ongoing discussions and concerns regarding crypto ATM-related fraud and their potential use in illicit activities. Regulatory bodies like the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) classify crypto ATM operators as money transmitters, subjecting them to specific registration, reporting, and compliance requirements. However, enforcement and oversight remain challenging. Key regulatory hurdles include: Ensuring consistent and effective KYC/AML compliance across potentially thousands of machines. Addressing the risk of scams where users are directed to deposit money into crypto ATMs. Clarifying which specific digital assets would be supported and their regulatory status (e.g., securities vs. commodities). Integrating these operations with existing federal building security and financial protocols. Any implementation would require close coordination between the GSA, FinCEN, the SEC, the CFTC, and potentially state regulators, highlighting the intricate nature of US Crypto Regulation . Understanding Blockchain Technology and Crypto ATMs At its core, a Crypto ATM is a kiosk that allows individuals to exchange cash or debit card funds for cryptocurrency, or vice versa, facilitating interaction with Blockchain Technology . Unlike traditional bank ATMs that connect to your bank account, crypto ATMs connect to cryptocurrency exchanges or wallets to perform transactions on the blockchain network. Here’s a simplified look at how they generally work: User Interaction: The user selects the cryptocurrency they want to buy or sell. Identity Verification: For compliance, the ATM typically requires identity verification, often via a phone number, ID scan, or even biometrics for larger transactions. Transaction: Buying Crypto: The user inserts cash or uses a debit card. The ATM sends the crypto to the user’s digital wallet address (often provided via a QR code scan). Selling Crypto: The user sends crypto from their wallet to the ATM’s address. Once confirmed on the blockchain, the ATM dispenses cash. Blockchain Confirmation: The transaction is processed and confirmed on the respective blockchain ledger, leveraging the decentralized and transparent nature of Blockchain Technology . The global network of Crypto ATMs has grown significantly, providing a physical touchpoint for accessing the digital asset space. Placing them in highly visible federal buildings could significantly boost public awareness and interaction with this technology. Potential Impact on Cryptocurrency Adoption Introducing Crypto ATMs into federal buildings could have a substantial, albeit perhaps symbolic, impact on Cryptocurrency Adoption . Federal buildings are perceived as secure, official, and accessible public spaces. Seeing crypto services offered there could lend an air of legitimacy to digital assets for many who remain skeptical or unfamiliar. Consider the potential ripple effects: Increased Visibility: Exposure to cryptocurrency beyond online platforms or niche retail locations. Perceived Legitimacy: Association with government buildings might reduce public fear of scams or illegitimacy. Accessibility: Providing a physical, potentially easier on-ramp for individuals less comfortable with online exchanges. Educational Opportunity: While not explicitly educational kiosks, their presence could spark curiosity and encourage learning about crypto and Blockchain Technology . However, the actual impact on widespread adoption would depend heavily on the number of machines installed, their functionality, transaction limits, fees, and the public’s reaction. It’s a step that could either be a catalyst for broader acceptance or remain a niche service within government facilities. Challenges and Criticisms Despite the potential benefits, the proposal faces significant challenges and attracts criticism. Beyond the regulatory hurdles mentioned earlier, practical and security concerns abound. Security Risks: Federal buildings have stringent security protocols. Integrating third-party kiosks, especially those handling financial transactions involving volatile assets, adds layers of complexity. Physical security of the machines themselves is also a factor. Cost and Maintenance: Who bears the cost of installation, maintenance, security, and compliance for these machines? The GSA or the private operators? Public Perception: While some may see this as innovation, others might view it skeptically, associating crypto with risks or illicit activities, potentially drawing negative attention to federal facilities. Limited Scope: Crypto ATMs typically offer basic buy/sell functions for a limited number of cryptocurrencies. They don’t represent the full spectrum of digital asset use cases (DeFi, NFTs, etc.). Regulatory Uncertainty: The evolving nature of US Crypto Regulation means that rules governing these machines could change, impacting their operation or legality within federal spaces. Critics might argue that federal buildings are not appropriate venues for commercial financial services, especially those as volatile and regulation-sensitive as cryptocurrency. They might suggest that promoting Cryptocurrency Adoption is not a core function of the GSA. What Happens Next? Representative Gooden’s proposal is currently a request to the General Services Administration. The GSA would need to evaluate the feasibility, security implications, costs, and alignment with federal policy and US Crypto Regulation . This process could involve studies, consultations with other government agencies, and potentially pilot programs. The political dimension is also noteworthy. Aligning the proposal with a pro-crypto stance from a former president suggests it could become a talking point in broader political discussions about technology and finance. The outcome will likely depend on the GSA’s assessment, the evolving regulatory landscape, and the political will to push such an initiative forward. This proposal serves as a tangible example of how proponents of digital assets are actively seeking ways to integrate them into the physical and institutional fabric of the country, pushing the boundaries of where and how we interact with Blockchain Technology . Conclusion: A Step Towards Mainstream? The proposal to install Crypto ATMs in Federal Buildings is a bold statement about the potential future of finance and Cryptocurrency Adoption in the United States. It highlights the increasing desire to bridge the gap between traditional financial systems and the burgeoning world of digital assets powered by Blockchain Technology . While the stated benefits of innovation, identity verification, and transparency are compelling, the path is fraught with challenges, particularly concerning the complex landscape of US Crypto Regulation and security concerns. Whether this proposal comes to fruition remains to be seen. However, it undeniably pushes the conversation forward regarding the role of cryptocurrencies in public spaces and within official government perception. It’s a move that could, if successful, significantly normalize digital asset use, or, if unsuccessful, underscore the significant hurdles still facing widespread integration.

The total crypto market capitalization rose 8.5% since March. Cryptocurrency traders have frequently zoomed in on the need for crypto to show a clear “ decoupling ” from the stock market, and over the past 10 days, the intraday movements of Bitcoin ( BTC ) and major altcoins have closely tracked those of the S&P 500, even as trade war developments have dominated market sentiment. S&P 500 futures (left) vs. Total crypto cap, USD (right). Source: TradingView/Cointelegraph A decoupling would validate digital assets as an independent class and address growing concerns about a potential global economic recession. This ongoing correlation has led market participants to question whether the cryptocurrency market is destined to follow the stock market’s lead indefinitely, and what conditions would be necessary for a genuine decoupling to occur. Stock market shows strength despite trade tensions The S&P 500 reached its peak on Feb. 19 and has since struggled to reclaim the 5,800 level, a support that had held for four months. Despite persistent pressure from US trade disputes with Canada and Mexico, as well as the imposition of new tariffs affecting nearly every major economic region, equities have demonstrated notable resilience. Chinese state media recently reported that the United States has quietly initiated trade negotiations. Although China officially maintains a 125% retaliatory tariff on US imports, it has granted waivers for sectors such as ethane, semiconductors, and certain pharmaceuticals. The United States, in turn, has partially exempted automakers from new tariffs. These actions suggest that both sides are gradually making concessions. There is a reasonable possibility that the S&P 500 established a bottom at 4,835 on April 7, with further gains from the current 5,635 level remaining plausible. The stock market has responded positively to robust first-quarter earnings, as companies adapt to tariffs by relocating production outside China or expanding operations within the United States. For instance, Microsoft reported a 13.2% year-over-year increase in revenue, with higher margins and strong demand for artificial intelligence. Meta also delivered earnings and revenue that exceeded market expectations on April 30. These results have alleviated concerns about a potential AI bubble or the risk that the trade war could force companies to reduce investment. The market’s focus shifts to the Federal Reserve Rather than concentrating on the recent decline in US PMI manufacturing data-which reached a five-month low in April, market participants are closely monitoring the Federal Reserve’s next policy moves. Following a year of balance sheet reduction, the Fed is now considering asset purchases to help ease selling pressure. An increase in liquidity is typically favorable for risk-oriented assets. Therefore, even if a full decoupling does not occur, cryptocurrencies could still benefit from a more supportive macroeconomic environment. S&P 500 futures (left) vs. Total crypto cap, USD (right). Source: TradingView/Cointelegraph Despite the short-term correlation, the cryptocurrency market has outperformed equities in recent months. Since March, the total crypto market capitalization has risen by 8.5%, while the S&P 500 has declined by 5.3%. Over a six-month period, this divergence becomes even more pronounced: the total crypto market cap is up 29%, while the S&P 500 is down 2%. It is therefore inaccurate to suggest that these markets move in perfect synchrony, particularly when viewed over longer timeframes. Related: Bitcoin to $1M by 2029 fueled by ETF and gov’t demand — Bitwise exec It is still premature to declare a definitive bottom for the S&P 500 or to conclude that the trade war has been resolved. An economic recession would likely have negative implications for both markets. However, the current strength in equities indicates reduced risk aversion among investors. For the time being, the elevated correlation between cryptocurrencies and stocks may represent the most favorable scenario.

Bitcoin’s resilience above the psychological $90,000–$95,000 level, an unexpected surge in stablecoin issuance and a swarm of textbook bullish patterns across large-caps and meme names have converged to create what veteran chartist Josh Olszewicz calls “one of the cleanest multi-asset breakout tapes we’ve seen since late 2023.” Crypto Bull Run Back? Olszewicz’s argument begins and ends with liquidity. Two consecutive one-billion-dollar Tether mints on 29 April pushed combined USDT + USDC supply to a fresh all-time high, an event he frames as an unequivocal tailwind for speculative assets. “Tether’s been printing, printing, and minting, baby,” he said, emphasising that the dual $1 billion tranches arrived alongside a clear premium in the USDT/USD pair on Kraken—evidence, in his view, of real demand rather than opportunistic treasury rebalancing. “Typically that means people are deploying it in alts. That’s why stable-coin mints—specifically Tether—[are] generally bullish for alts because people are using it to speculate.” The liquidity pulse arrives just as several macro obstacles appear to be receding. Bitcoin survived a negative-print US GDP release, sticky PCE inflation data and what Olszewicz called “some jobs numbers that came out this week,” without surrendering its three-month up-trend. Meanwhile gold has rolled over and the Dollar Index remains pinned near cycle lows, recreating the “everything-rally” backdrop that powered crypto’s late-2023 melt-up. Funding markets, however, are delivering a curious split: “We still have negative funding on the BTC side on crypto exchanges. We have positive funding in legacy land with futures. So that’s very bizarre right now, but so far so good.” Against that backdrop, Olszewicz drills into the Ichimoku-cloud mechanics that underpin his altcoin watch-list. The premise is as old as the indicator itself: a daily candle close inside the cloud accompanied by a bullish Tenkan-Kijun (TK) cross triggers a mean-reversion target to the opposing edge of the cloud. “All these trades are always the same. I never treat them differently,” he said. “You get a better entry… it’s just a game of probabilities.” The strategy sets clear invalidations—either the Kijun line or a lower-low—and provides what he characterises as Dow-theory mean-reversion framed through an Ichimoku lens. That formula is now flashing across a surprising breadth of assets. Solana And Curve Solana sits at the top of his list. The layer-one token has posted six consecutive red daily candles, sculpting the “right shoulder” of an inverted head-and-shoulders whose neckline rises toward $200. “What I’ve got to laser focus on is this potential edge-to-edge move,” he explained, noting that ideal entries would materialise between $140 and $120 but are not essential. “Within the next week or two, you should get a great signal on an entry here on SOL just from the cloud.” Related Reading: XRP Gains Ground in Weekly Crypto Inflows as Ethereum Continues Downtrend Curve, by contrast, is already in motion—up double-digits on a day when most altcoins bled. “Why is it up 10 percent today and everything else is down? I don’t have a good answer for that,” he admitted. Yet the technical structure leaves little to interpret: a multi-month flat-bottom accumulation, a candle close inside the cloud near its lower boundary and a bullish TK cross. “You’re on your journey to somewhere up here—the other edge of the cloud,” he said, implying a measured-move objective near $1.20 that would represent a near-doubling from current levels. Ethereum And Litecoin Where Solana and Curve show imminent triggers, Ethereum remains the quintessential laggard, still chiselling out what Olszewicz labels a bottoming process. “It’s going to take ETH kicking and screaming to get started here but this is a bottom in process. Certainly may take you into June.” The calculus is familiar: traders intent on rotation may find better risk-adjusted returns elsewhere, returning to ETH only once its own daily cloud admits a candle close. Litecoin exhibits a similar dynamic, with an inverted head-and-shoulders outline that “feels a little early,” perhaps ripening by early June. FET, LINK, ALGO Fetch.ai breached the cloud on April 23 and already sports a bullish TK cross, yet Olszewicz acknowledges it arrives “after two or three weeks of up-move,” reducing risk-reward. Related Reading: CoinGecko Q1 Report: Top 10 Crypto Exchanges See Spot Trading Volume Drop To $5.4 Trillion Chainlink shows a textbook right-shoulder still under construction—“alerts at fifteen,” he suggests—while Algorand edges toward a 32-cent cloud target, one daily close away from confirmation. In each instance, the analyst reiterates that until the formal triggers print, the probability of follow-through remains statistically lower. DOGE, PEPE And WIF The most combustible corner of the market—the meme cohort—is, in his telling, already foreshadowing a retail return. Dogecoin intrigues him most. “Along with ENA, one of the best bang for your bucks is Doge,” he said, though he concedes the pattern needs another week to sculpt a complete right-shoulder. He is explicit about his trigger: “Give it another week or two and this is definitely one of the better-looking setups,” with attention fixed on the $0.175 area. PEPE presents fewer moving parts: it is inside the cloud with a bullish TK cross and a clear neckline at the Kijun. “If ETH even sneezes higher, I expect this to just be up twenty-five percent one day,” he said, while cautioning that a transitional “negative twenty percent day” could precede the pop. WIF, for its part, is “slamming against the cloud,” on the cusp of its own TK cross. Having retraced from $4.80 to current levels, it offers what he calls “a great-looking setup,” albeit one where “the greed in me always wants an entry down here”—a reference to a hypothetical bid parked at the cloud’s lower edge. BTC Dominance Bitcoin dominance, still pressing cycle highs, complicates the rotation narrative. “Does it really matter that you’re not all-in BTC if this is an extreme in dominance?” he asked rhetorically. His answer is temporal. Dominance mattered enormously at the October 2023 bottom, and he suspects it will matter again once it rolls over. “Come May, June, I think we will start to see the outperformance of the altcoins,” he predicts, but he tempers that with a blunt reminder: “It hasn’t made sense to sit in these BTC pairs.” The exception is Solana’s BTC chart, which mirrors the USD thesis with a half-formed inverted head-and-shoulders and a cloud target significantly higher. At press time, SOL traded at $151.90.

44043167,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=154487,1746140427,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Coinbase MOVE Trading: Urgent Suspension Announced,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/coinbase-move-trading-alert/,"Heads up, crypto traders! If you’re involved in Coinbase MOVE trading , there’s an important update you need to know. Coinbase has announced an upcoming change that will directly impact your ability to trade the MOVE token on their platform. What’s Happening with Coinbase MOVE Trading? Coinbase recently shared via their official X account that they will be suspending trading for the MOVE token. This isn’t just a temporary pause; it’s a complete halt to trading activities for this specific asset on their exchange. The suspension is scheduled to take place on May 15 at 2 PM ET . After this time, you will no longer be able to buy, sell, or trade MOVE tokens using Coinbase’s trading services. According to CoinGecko data at the time of the original announcement, the MOVE token was trading around $0.2303, experiencing a 3.2% dip over the preceding 24 hours. News like a trading suspension crypto can often influence market price, so it’s crucial for holders to be aware of the deadline. Why Does Coinbase Delisting Happen? Coinbase explained that this decision stems from their regular process of monitoring listed assets. They continuously evaluate cryptocurrencies on their platform to ensure they meet the exchange’s stringent listing criteria. When an asset no longer meets these standards, a Coinbase delisting becomes a possibility. The reasons behind a crypto delisting can vary. They often include factors such as: Failure to meet technical requirements (e.g., network issues, wallet support problems). Low trading volume and liquidity, making it difficult for users to trade effectively. Concerns about the project’s development, team, or future viability. Regulatory or compliance issues. Security vulnerabilities. Changes in market conditions or user demand. While Coinbase’s statement specifically mentioned ‘meeting listing criteria,’ the exact criteria that MOVE failed to meet were not detailed in the initial announcement. This is standard practice, as exchanges typically don’t disclose the specific reasons for each individual delisting. Impact of MOVE Token Delisting on Holders For anyone holding MOVE tokens on Coinbase, the most immediate impact of the MOVE token delisting is the loss of the ability to trade the asset on that specific platform after the May 15 deadline. This can affect liquidity and convenience. Key Considerations for Holders: Trading Stops: You won’t be able to execute buy or sell orders for MOVE on Coinbase after 2 PM ET on May 15. Withdrawals: While trading is suspended, users are typically still allowed to withdraw their affected tokens for a period after the suspension date. It is absolutely critical to check official communications from Coinbase regarding the withdrawal window. Don’t assume you have unlimited time. Price Volatility: Delisting announcements can sometimes lead to increased selling pressure on the affected asset on that specific exchange as holders look to offload before the deadline. Finding Alternatives: If you wish to continue holding or trading MOVE, you will need to withdraw your tokens to a private wallet or another exchange that supports MOVE trading. It’s important to remember that a delisting from one exchange, even a major one like Coinbase, doesn’t necessarily mean the token is dead or delisted everywhere. However, it does reduce accessibility and can impact market perception. Understanding Trading Suspension Crypto in Broader Context A trading suspension crypto is a measure exchanges take for various reasons, sometimes temporarily due to technical upgrades or network issues, and sometimes permanently as a prelude to full delisting. In this case, the announcement clearly indicates a permanent suspension of trading, leading to the effective delisting of MOVE from the platform. This isn’t the first time Coinbase, or any major exchange, has delisted an asset. It’s a necessary part of managing a dynamic cryptocurrency platform and portfolio. While inconvenient for affected users, it’s presented by exchanges as a way to maintain platform integrity and user safety. What Should MOVE Holders on Coinbase Do? Actionable Insights If you hold MOVE tokens on Coinbase, here are the crucial steps you should take immediately: Check Your Email/Coinbase Account: Look for official communication from Coinbase. They will provide detailed instructions regarding the suspension and, most importantly, the process and deadline for withdrawing your MOVE tokens. Decide Your Next Step: Do you want to sell your MOVE before the May 15 deadline? Do you want to withdraw it to a private wallet? Do you want to send it to another exchange that lists MOVE? Make a decision based on your investment strategy. Execute Your Plan Before the Deadline: If you plan to sell on Coinbase, do so before May 15, 2 PM ET. If you plan to withdraw, initiate the withdrawal well in advance of the deadline to avoid any last-minute issues. Ensure you have a secure wallet address or the correct deposit address for the receiving exchange. Be Aware of Fees: Factor in any withdrawal fees if you decide to move your tokens off the platform. Ignoring the deadline could result in your assets becoming inaccessible for trading on Coinbase, forcing you into a withdrawal process that might have its own time limits. Conclusion: Navigating the MOVE Suspension The announcement of the Coinbase MOVE trading suspension on May 15 at 2 PM ET is a significant event for holders of the token on the platform. This decision, based on Coinbase’s ongoing review of assets against their listing standards, means the MOVE token delisting is imminent for the exchange. While crypto delisting and trading suspension crypto events are part of the volatile nature of the market, they require prompt action from affected users. Ensure you understand the implications, check official Coinbase communications, and take the necessary steps to manage your MOVE tokens before the deadline.

The company is developing a full stack bitcoin mining platform, enhancing product velocity with open-source AI, and driving operating leverage in-house banking services. XYZ stock's valuation is attractive, trading at extremely low multiples despite solid growth prospects and impressive operating efficiency. The market misunderstands Block's bitcoin strategy, creating an asymmetric risk/reward opportunity as the company deepens its ecosystem and enhances financial accessibility. Shares of Fintech Block, Inc. ( XYZ ) cratered after the company reported weaker than expected earnings and slashed guidance . The report is definitely weaker than bulls like myself had hoped for, but it is illustrative of the challenging macro environment we are in. Despite this, I remain very optimistic about the company's long-term growth runway and see the vision that they are building quite clearly. The negatives in this report are clear: slowing gross profit growth, downward guidance revision, no growth in Cash App card users or transacting actives, high stock-based comp expense, and slowing GPV (gross payment volume) growth. The market has plenty of reasons to punish the stock after this report, but I still see several reasons to remain optimistic. For one, management believes the bottom is in for gross profit growth and expects 12% YoY growth for 2025 as a whole. Meanwhile, the market is completely ignoring the ongoing profitability inflection Block is enjoying. The company demonstrated strong operating leverage in its subscription and services line item, growing revenue by over $200m YoY (+12.5% YoY) while segment COGS grew only 2%. Segment gross margin grew from 83.9% to 85.5% YoY. Segment contributions here grew YoY from both Square and Cash App, and I maintain the conviction that this line item is the future driver of Block's growth. It's the key to a sustainable profitability inflection for the company, and recent news regarding Cash App Borrow, discussed below, will begin driving strong operating leverage in this line item. Block's highest margin segment is growing the fastest. This counts for something, despite the meager overall growth rates. Q1 Shareholder Letter Finally, management expects its first gross profit contributions from the Proto segment by year-end. This segment will capture sales of its bitcoin mining chip that is expected to begin recognizing revenue in 2H 2025. I wrote on Block earlier this year stating that the Bitcoin inflection is looming . I rated the stock a Strong Buy. The stock has underperformed the S&P (SP500) by a wide margin to date, and that underperformance is only widening in the post-market carnage. In this article, I stand by that rating. Core to my thesis is that Block is setting up critical infrastructure for an economy that sees increasing mainstream adoption of Bitcoin. The company is building a full stack bitcoin mining platform with an MDK (Mining Development Kit), a custom mining chip, and software to help more people access the bitcoin mining ecosystem. Although my previous rating has not worked in my favor to date, I maintain a strong belief that Block is a defining company in an era that is becoming increasingly friendly to cryptocurrency. I have a few other articles that are important to a discussion on Block's crypto opportunity. Namely, my article on MicroStrategy Incorporated ( MSTR ), and my recent Strong Buy rating on Bitcoin USD (BTC-USD) itself. For all intents and purposes, MSTR stock is effectively levered bitcoin. Bitcoin USD ((BTC-USD)) itself, at current, is essentially a call option on geopolitical turmoil and the erosion of trust in the US Dollar as a neutral mechanism for global trade. There has never been such a structurally bullish time for Bitcoin, considering the current U.S. administration is weaponizing its consumer base and reserve currency. Meanwhile, that same U.S. president has been outspoken on his desire to make the United States the crypto capital of the world . New York City, the financial capital of the world, is hosting its first-ever Crypto Summit this month. This article will not focus so heavily on Bitcoin. Clearly, the market is unimpressed with Block's maverick status within the crypto sphere, it doesn't care about the company's bitcoin accumulation, nor the fact that it enriches its user base by making bitcoin accessible, nor that it is becoming the first U.S. supplier of Bitcoin mining hardware. This misunderstanding by the market has led to a significant mispricing which is only exacerbated by today's selloff. I'd point you to my three aforementioned articles for a deeper understanding of my position on this mispricing. My Take Block has received an enormous amount of criticism stemming mostly from its poor stock performance. Investors are losing patience with CEO Jack Dorsey and the company's perceived lack of progress. While sales growth has stalled from the COVID-era boom, the stock's valuation has fallen more than enough at this point to compensate. The company traded at only 13.5x forward earnings and 11.6x forward cash flow before the post-market selloff today. The valuation is even more attractive now. Analysts expect Block to grow EPS in the double digits for the next several years. Further, Block's impressive operating efficiency is best illustrated by the fact that it generates over 180% more net income per employee than its sector peers. I believe now is a great time to either accumulate Block stock or initiate a position. For those unconvinced by the fundamentals of a compelling valuation, a growth reversal, and respectable efficiency, let's talk about the product velocity we've seen out of the company this year. For one, Block is the only Fintech (to my knowledge) that is openly embracing and developing its own open-source AI model, dubbed codename:goose . This is powered by the company's NVIDIA Corporation ( NVDA ) GB200 cluster. Internally, Block is using goose mostly for software engineering, but the potential for AI throughout Block's ecosystem is very promising. Goose will contribute to ongoing increases in product velocity and innovation. Over time, the company can lean into goose for fraud analytics, streamlining loan approvals, marketing ad targeting, and helping Square sellers create websites and marketing campaigns. It noted in the shareholder letter that it wants Cash App users and Square sellers to have a personal CFO and COO at their fingertips. Further, there was news recently that is important for Block's ongoing profitability inflection that went entirely ignored by the market. The company's in-house bank, Square Financial Services (""SFS""), received FDIC approval to provide Cash App Borrow loans. The company had previously partnered with an external bank for its nearly $9b in origination volume for this product in 2024. Bringing the servicing of these loans in-house enhances Block's unit economics by cutting out that intermediary. In other words, we can expect ongoing growth in the company's subscription and services gross margin. Management also noted that they are open to selling these loans off their book to maintain flexibility with their available capital. Combining this improvement in unit economics with the company's increased inflow and gross profit per user makes me confident they will continue growing subscription and services revenue and gross margin. The average Cash App Borrow loan was less than $100 and less than a month in duration in 2024. These are microloans aiming to replace payday loans which are outright predatory, considering they charge interest based on a fee structure , and have a clear product/market fit. Cash App Borrow has less than a 3% default rate historically. Very low risk. SFS has been servicing Square small business loans since it received its bank charter in 2021 and has seen solid success with its innovative repayment structure. Square sellers pay loans back slowly with a small percentage of each sale going to loan repayment. This greatly de-risks the company's credit book from the lending perspective, makes the loan easier to manage for Square sellers, and makes credit more accessible for small businesses. Block also recently released enhanced cashflow management capabilities for Square sellers, including savings recommendations for prudent expense management, and launched a new unified interface for full stack point-of-sale services. It's been a busy month of announcements for the company. Despite headcount reductions throughout 2024 , the company has actually increased product velocity. The company is operating with a renewed focus under the unified leadership of founder-CEO Jack Dorsey, and sits at three key inflection points with AI, the mass accessibility of financial services, and the proliferation of bitcoin as a means for cross-border settlement and as a modern savings vehicle. The market doesn't seem to understand the operating leverage that Block is achieving through these handfuls of initiatives. This gives investors who recognize these enhancements a wonderful opportunity to accumulate shares in an innovative technology company with a very compressed multiple. Investor Takeaway Owning Block stock has been frustrating for the past several years. Many long-term investors have grown impatient with the company's leadership and the lack of stock returns. I believe this only strengthens the bull case for the stock, considering we are at the point of broad-based market fear and capitulation in the stock. The company has been head-down and in the weeds driving product enhancements to better serve its growing customer base, while driving operating efficiency and enhanced unit economics. Broad-based weakness during Q1 and the ongoing uncertainty in Q2 drove weaker than expected results and guidance, and another frustrating selloff. I believe this selloff is a gift. The company is growing a durable extremely high margin segment in the double digits while deploying AI throughout its internal operations and products to increase innovation and value for customers. Further, the market seems to regard the company's bitcoin aspirations as a distraction. I couldn't disagree more. The company is becoming the first mining chip provider based in the U.S., the largest mining chip company is currently a Chinese chip designer, while deepening the accessibility of bitcoin throughout its ecosystem. Over time, as public perception of Bitcoin turns more favorable, Block will have several levers to facilitate the mass adoption of Bitcoin in cross-border trade, peer-to-peer payments, and retail transactions. The market is impatient with management's lack of focus on short-term profitability growth. Instead, management remains focused on achieving its mission of enhancing the accessibility of the modern economy for all people. This has created very durable, sticky customer relationships with both low-income consumers and small-to-medium sized businesses. The obvious risk with this strategy is that these consumers and businesses are the most sensitive to inflation and recessionary macro conditions. Now, the company has shifted focus to deepening relationships with Cash App consumers, leaning more heavily into banking services for both Cash App and Square, and building the infrastructure on which the Bitcoin economy will operate in the U.S. There is much to look forward to in Block's future. I maintain my Strong Buy rating despite the poor results from today.",BTC-USD|XYZ,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|FIAT|MARKET|MINING,"{'name': 'Seeking Alpha', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/seekingalpha.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",seekingalpha,2025-05-01 23:05:30
44043438,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=154488,1746141025,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Fivetran Acquisition of Census Creates Complete Data Movement Platform,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/fivetran-census-acquisition/,"In the fast-paced world of technology, where data is king for everything from blockchain analytics to operational efficiency, the infrastructure enabling smooth data flow is paramount. This is true for crypto enterprises and traditional businesses alike. A significant development in this crucial area is the recent news: Fivetran , a leader in automated data integration, has acquired Census, a prominent Reverse ETL platform. This move is set to transform how businesses manage their data, promising an end-to-end data movement platform . Understanding the Fivetran and Census Acquisition For over a decade, Fivetran has specialized in Extract, Transform, Load (ETL) processes, helping companies consolidate data from numerous sources into cloud data warehouses. Census, founded more recently in 2018, tackles the opposite challenge: Reverse ETL. It enables businesses to move data *out* of data warehouses and into operational tools like CRM, marketing automation, and support systems. The Census acquisition by Fivetran brings these two complementary capabilities under one roof. Why is this combination important? Complete Data Loop: Previously, companies often needed separate vendors for ETL (getting data in) and Reverse ETL (getting data out). The acquisition creates a single vendor for the entire data journey. Customer Demand: Fivetran’s CEO, George Fraser, stated that customers had been requesting a Reverse ETL solution for years, making this acquisition a direct response to market needs. Simplified Stack: Businesses can potentially simplify their data infrastructure stack, reducing complexity and vendor management overhead. Why This Move Made Sense: The Power of Reverse ETL Integrating a robust Reverse ETL solution was a strategic priority for Fivetran. While they considered building their own, they recognized the value of bringing in a company like Census that had already perfected the technology. Fraser highlighted that the underlying technical challenges for standard ETL and Reverse ETL are quite distinct, despite both involving data movement. Furthermore, the synergy between the two companies was clear. Fivetran and Census shared a significant number of customers. According to Fraser, customers who preferred Fivetran’s approach to data integration were also likely to appreciate Census’s philosophy regarding operational data sync. This shared customer base and similar product philosophies made Census a natural fit for Fivetran’s expansion. Building an End-to-End Data Movement Platform The goal is to build a truly comprehensive data movement platform . Once the acquisition is finalized, the Census team will join Fivetran, and the Census brand will be integrated into the Fivetran offering. This isn’t just about adding a feature; it’s about creating a unified experience for customers needing to move data in any direction. The deal terms were not disclosed, but Census had raised over $80 million in funding and was last valued at $630 million in 2022. The long-standing relationship between the founding teams also played a role, dating back to their time in the Y Combinator program. This acquisition is a significant development in the enterprise data landscape, providing businesses with a more streamlined and powerful way to leverage their data assets, from getting data into their warehouse to operationalizing it across their organization. For companies operating in data-intensive fields like cryptocurrency, having reliable and efficient data infrastructure is non-negotiable for growth and compliance.

The trade offer aims to increase imports of American goods and ease the transatlantic trade deficit. The drama from the Trump tariffs is still ongoing, and the EU is now pushing for what it considers a fair and balanced deal before July, when the tariffs will take effect. The EU’s strategic offer According to Maroš Šefčovič, the EU’s trade commissioner, the European Union is proposing a €50B increase in purchases of U.S. goods. The €50B investment is aimed at easing the growing trade tensions with Washington. Šefčovič told the Financial Times that the EU is making “certain progress” in its negotiations with the U.S. The EU however made it clear that it will not accept the 10% tariff recently imposed by President Donald Trump as a fair outcome. The proposal will also help to close what the U.S. perceives as a €50B trade deficit with Europe. Šefčovič stated this trade gap could be quickly closed if Europe increased its imports of American goods such as its liquefied natural gas (LNG), soybeans, and other agricultural products. “If what we are looking at as a problem in the deficit is €50B, I believe that we can really solve this problem very quickly,” he said. The bloc has been working to prevent a full-blown transatlantic trade war since Trump’s announcement of a 10% tariff on most countries on April 2. The U.S. government also proposed a 20% “reciprocal” tariff for the EU. The extra 20% tariffs were eventually suspended to allow 90 days for negotiation, but the initial 10% tariff remains in place, and further duties could be added on in July if no agreement is reached between the nations. Šefčovič explained that the EU is working on a deal that is “balanced and fair,” not one that locks in high tariffs. “It will be very difficult to reach a deal that is clearly good and acceptable for our member states and our European parliament,” he said. Retaliatory measures are still on the table The EU has so far embraced diplomacy during the trade talks, but the bloc did not neglect preparing for the worst. The European Commission, the agency responsible for negotiating trade deals on behalf of the EU’s 27 member states, has outlined both incentives for a deal and retaliatory measures in the event that negotiations fall through. On the topic of retaliatory measures, the EU has a €21B retaliatory tariff package ready for American goods such as Harley-Davidson motorcycles, poultry, and clothing. The tariff is currently paused until July 14. “We will be working meticulously with every member state to have a robust response, which would have unanimous support,” Šefčovič said. The Commission recently briefed its ambassadors on both negotiation tactics like carrots and sticks in a bid to prepare the bloc for any outcome. Šefčovič emphasized that while the EU is pushing for a resolution, it stands firm in rejecting tariffs it deems unfair. When he was asked directly if the EU would accept a 10% tariff baseline as a compromise, Šefčovič responded that such a level is “very high.” The EU has shown that it is open to adjustments and carve-outs announced by the U.S. government. Adjustments include changes such as relief for the automotive sector. Šefčovič suggested that that was likely in response to warnings about a potential economic fallout. Šefčovič also stated that the EU is open to cooperating with the U.S. on broader global trade challenges, including those related to China. He proposed working together to address issues like steel and aluminum overcapacity, semiconductor development, and reducing dependency on critical raw materials. “We believe that we can actually achieve a lot together,” Šefčovič said.

44043742,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=154489,1746141621,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Anthropic Claude Unveils Powerful New AI Integrations,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/anthropic-claude-integrations/,"The world of artificial intelligence is constantly evolving, with leading models pushing boundaries to offer more utility. For those following the intersection of AI and technology, Anthropic’s recent updates to their AI Chatbot , Claude, represent a significant step forward. These enhancements aim to make Claude a more powerful and interconnected tool for users across various plans. What are Anthropic Claude’s New AI Integrations? Anthropic has introduced a new feature called Integrations, available in beta for users on Claude Max, Team, and Enterprise plans (and coming soon to Pro). This builds upon Anthropic’s existing MCP protocol, which allows AI models to access data from various sources. Integrations take this further, enabling developers to create and host app servers that expand Claude’s abilities. Users can then discover and connect these servers directly to Anthropic Claude . Think of it this way: instead of just chatting with Claude, you can now allow it to interact with the tools you use daily. Anthropic highlights that connecting your tools gives Claude crucial context about your work, understanding project histories, task statuses, and organizational knowledge. This allows the Claude AI to potentially take actions or retrieve specific information directly from those connected platforms. Key Integration Examples: Atlassian: Enables Claude to summarize and create pages within Confluence. Zapier: Allows Claude to trigger actions within Zapier’s vast network of app automation workflows. Other Partners: Initial partners also include Cloudflare, Intercom, Square, and PayPal, each adding unique capabilities. These AI Integrations are designed to streamline workflows and make Claude a central hub for interacting with your digital environment. Exploring Advanced AI Research Capabilities Alongside Integrations, Anthropic also launched an expanded deep research capability called Advanced Research. This tool is designed to provide more comprehensive reports on a given topic by crawling a multitude of internal and external sources. While Anthropic’s previous research tool was fast, Advanced Research takes more time (from five to 45 minutes) to deliver deeper insights. This enhancement is particularly relevant as AI models, including the AI Chatbot landscape, increasingly incorporate ‘reasoning’ abilities. These models can break down complex problems and fact-check information, crucial skills for conducting in-depth research. Advanced Research leverages this, allowing Claude to investigate different parts of a request before compiling a detailed report. How Advanced Research Works: Breaks down complex requests into smaller components. Investigates each part deeply across hundreds of sources. Compiles findings into a comprehensive report. Provides clear citations linking back to original source material. Can utilize newly expanded connectors, including Integrations and local systems via the desktop app. This focus on thoroughness and source citation positions Advanced AI Research as a valuable tool for users needing detailed information and verification. Keeping Pace in the Competitive AI Landscape These new features, AI Integrations and Advanced Research, are part of Anthropic’s broader strategy to remain competitive with other leading models like Google’s Gemini and OpenAI’s ChatGPT. The AI market is rapidly advancing, and continuous innovation is necessary to attract and retain users, especially those on higher-tier plans. Anthropic reportedly has ambitious revenue goals, aiming for $34.5 billion by 2027, significantly up from their reported $1.4 billion annualized revenue in early March. Expanding the capabilities of Anthropic Claude through features like deeper research and app connectivity is key to achieving such growth by offering more value to enterprise and team users. Conclusion: A More Connected and Capable Claude Anthropic’s introduction of Integrations and the enhanced Advanced Research tool marks a significant evolution for the Claude AI . By allowing users to connect Claude to their essential apps and empowering it with deeper, more thorough research capabilities, Anthropic is making its AI Chatbot a more practical and powerful assistant for complex tasks. These updates are crucial steps for Anthropic as it navigates the competitive AI landscape and works towards its growth objectives, offering users more reasons to choose Claude for their advanced AI needs.

44044047,https://cryptonews.com/?p=356726,1746142200,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/52/44044047.jpeg,South Korean Regulator Designates Crypto Exchange Bithumb as a Conglomerate,https://cryptonews.com/news/south-korean-regulator-designates-crypto-exchange-bithumb-as-a-conglomerate/,"The South Korean Fair Trade Commission (FTC) has classified the crypto exchange Bithumb as a conglomerate. The designation will force the company to adhere to a range of financial compliance rules. Per Jeongi Shinmun , Bithumb was one of just five companies added to the FTC’s list of conglomerate companies and business groups on May 1. Bithumb Conglomerate Status: What Does it Mean? The South Korean government has two separate conglomerate categories. The first is the “large conglomerate” category, which is subject to the strictest level of public disclosure regulations. The South Korean Fair Trade Commission at the Government Complex in Sejong, South Korea. (Source: Minseong Kim [CC BY-SA 4.0]) South Korean law requires “large conglomerates” to abide by more comprehensive financial disclosure requirements than regular firms. Companies with this designation must post regular reports on the status of their stock holdings. The designation also requires directors and their family members to comply with strict expropriation rules. South Korea’s top court ruled that presidential candidate Lee Jae-myung violated election law and sent the case back to the high court for final sentencing. https://t.co/3EhhchGsvu — Bloomberg (@business) May 1, 2025 And firms in a second “conglomerate” category must adhere to investment and cross-holding rules. The government created the rules to prevent powerful companies from buying significant quantities of shares in stock exchange-listed firms. The FTC had previously ruled that the Bithumb rival Upbit qualifies as a “large conglomerate .” In May 2022, the body named Upbit’s operator Dunamu the South Korean crypto sector’s first official “large conglomerate.” It upheld its ruling in 2023 and 2024, but this year moved the operator into the lower “conglomerate” category, along with Bithumb. Both designations place a range of restrictions on company activities. They prevent, for instance, companies from making equity investments or loan guarantees with their affiliates and subsidiaries. Only Five Companies Added to FTC’s List Bithumb was one of just five companies added to the “conglomerate” list this year. The FTC also named the weapons-maker LIG, the real estate player Daekwang, the food manufacturer Sajo, and the shipping firm EUKOR. Trading volumes on the Bithumb crypto exchange over the past 12 months. (Source: CoinGecko) Chaebol Scrutiny Continues South Korea’s Fair Trade Act contains several clauses pertaining to corporations. Most of these were created in response to the rise of chaebol business groups. Chaebol groups are typically large, family-run companies with a wide range of business operations. Examples include Samsung, LG, and CJ. Critics claim that these groups wield excessive power in the business and political space, giving little room for smaller firms to operate. The act prohibits larger domestic companies from providing unfair benefits to “special related parties.” Its investment-related clauses were originally designed to stop the phenomenon of “circular investment,” whereby company owners obfuscate their financial activities by investing in their own subsidiaries. The FTC explained that both Bithumb and Upbit were placed on the list because of a sharp rise in crypto trading in late 20224. The body wrote that at around the time of the US Presidential Election, the volume of customer deposits on domestic exchanges increased rapidly. The FTC’s rulings on crypto exchanges have attracted criticism from some detractors. The agency calculates the worth of firms’ total asset holdings when making its evaluations. Some claim that, as most exchanges hold more crypto than fiat, it is hard to ensure the accuracy of these calculations.

Senate Majority Leader John Thune, a South Dakota Republican, started the ball rolling to fast-track the Guiding and Establishing National Innovation for U.S. Stablecoins (GENIUS) Act , which is the Senate's version of two similar bills rolling through both chambers of Congress. The House of Representatives is expected to follow closely behind on its own voting. Thune's move to expedite the bill is meant to limit delays and floor action in order to get it done more quickly. It's so far unclear precisely when the Senate vote will happen, but an earlier vote on the effort in the Senate Banking Committee had approved it with a wide bipartisan majority of 18-6. The House Financial Services Committee also advanced its similar bill in April. “I look forward to passing the GENIUS Act in short order to keep digital asset innovation in America, protect customers, and make sure foreign companies are playing by the same rules,” said Senator Bill Hagerty, the Tennessee Republican who authored the bill, in a statement. It's also backed by Senator Tim Scott, the chairman of the Senate Banking Committee. President Donald Trump's self-described crypto sherpa, Bo Hines, the executive director of the Presidential Council of Advisers for Digital Assets, told CoinDesk earlier this week that the two bills are as much as 90% similar and that members of both chambers are seeking to work out the differences.

SOL price has regained 50-day SMA as a support level and now eyes $180 next. After closing the past three weeks in a bullish outlook, Solana (SOL) price has signaled the return of bullish sentiment. The large-cap altcoin, with a fully diluted valuation of about $90 billion and a 24-hour average trading volume of around $3.7 billion, gained over 20 percent in April 2025 to trade at about $150.33 on Thursday, during the late North American session. The rising bullish momentum for Solana is heavily bolstered by institutional investors and rising Futures Open Interest (OI) by over $1.6 billion in the past four weeks. Midterm Expectations for Solana Price In the weekly timeframe, Solana price has been consolidating in a megaphone structure for the past twelve months. Following a successful rebound from the lower border of the macro megaphone, SOL price has gradually gained bullish momentum. Moreover, the weekly MACD histograms have been signaling a growing bullish momentum after a prolonged bearish period. Additionally, the weekly MACD line is almost crossing the signal line, suggesting bullish sentiment. Meanwhile, the Bollinger Bands for Solana price, in the four-hour timeframe, have been squeezing, signaling a major price move in the near future. Fundamental Outlook The Solana network remains a premier ecosystem for DeFi developers, with a total value locked (TVL) of about $8 billion and a stablecoins market cap of around $13 billion. The Solana network has recorded significant growth in memecoins in the past year, thus achieving a 24-hour active addresses of over 3.6 million across its DeFi protocols. The anticipated approval of spot Solana ETFs before the end of 2025, will play a crucial role in SOL’s market outlook. Moreover, the rising adoption of Solana from institutional investors will help validate the network and increase its demand and liquidity in the long haul.",Price Analysis,EN,0,0,ALTCOIN|BUSINESS|MARKET|SOL|TRADING,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-05-01 23:34:31
44044411,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=719183,1746142525,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/44044411.jpeg,Security flaw in Cosmos SDK may allow DDoS attacks,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/security-flaw-in-cosmos-sdk-may-allow-ddos-attacks/,"Blockchain security firm Oak Security has raised concerns about a vulnerability in the Cosmos chain software development kit (SDK) that could lead to a Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attack on the network. In a Medium post, two of the firm’s researchers, Edward Kotysh and Christian Vari, explained why this is a major risk. According to the researchers , the vulnerability lies in the fact that the BeginBlock and EndBlock functions are not subject to gas metering. This is by design, as it enables developers to have some free computation time, as these two functions do not necessarily affect user transactions. However, the security experts warned that what was meant to be a minor leeway for developers could actually cause significant damage to Cosmos-based networks in several ways. These include causing network congestion, affecting validators, or even leading to a complete outage. They said: “This freedom can be a double-edged sword, and it can open up a Pandora’s box of potential vulnerabilities. The main issue is that without gas limits, poorly optimized or malicious code in BeginBlock and EndBlock can really wreak havoc.” The researchers tested their theories on the potential impact of the vulnerability by conducting experiments. In one of the experiments, they introduced randomized delays to the BeginBlock function at various block heights, with delays ranging from five seconds to one minute. From the experiments, the experts confirmed that the delays led to substantial congestion in the network, slowing its progression and increasing the time needed to complete blocks. It also affected validators, with several of them failing to sign blocks at the required times and some missing voting phases completely. Unsurprisingly, the limited number of validators available to sign transactions (less than two-thirds) meant that the test chain experienced temporary outages. The researchers noted that this could result in a complete outage on the mainnet itself, where there are several transactions happening at once that need to be finalized. Oak Security recommends fixes for developers Meanwhile, the security experts have recommended solutions to fix the vulnerability before a bad actor exploits it. According to them, there is a need to implement strict computation bounds so that even anyone cannot simply add any attack vector that will cause excessive computation. They identified three different ways of implementing this solution. These include adding time complexity to the BeginBlock and EndBlock functions so they do not run indefinitely, context wrapping to keep resource-intensive operations into metered contexts, and validation of all inputs to the function. Additionally, they called for more comprehensive testing and simulation to determine how the vulnerability could be exploited and the potential of its impact. They also identified architectural safeguards and operational monitoring to ensure the networks operate by standard metrics and detect any significant deviation. Cosmos SDK launches new version Meanwhile, the Cosmos SDK has yet to comment on the security report and whether it will do anything to address the issue on their end. This might be because the identified vulnerability is actually a design feature and not a bug or malware, like recent security alerts on supply chain attacks. Fortunately, developers using the Cosmos SDK can implement most of the recommendations from security experts, enabling them to take control of what they deploy and ensure it is not vulnerable to DDoS attacks. Interestingly, Cosmos SDK recently launched its version v0.53.0. According to the announcement on X, the version is a response to the pain points that builders raised about the previous version. The latest version reportedly comes with unordered transactions, improved capacities for community pools, custom governance mechanisms, epochs, and custom minting. It also comes with bug fixes, and developers can already upgrade to it on GitHub. Cosmos SDK is a tool for developers to easily build their own customized network and integrate with the Cosmos blockchain, a network seeking to become the Internet of Blockchains.

This dip, rather than signaling weakness, may in fact represent a healthy retracement as the cryptocurrency prepares for a new upward move. The price structure appears bullish on higher timeframes, especially after POL recently rebounded off the lower boundary of a long-term descending channel. According to a crypto analyst, Polygon could be on the verge of an explosive rally toward the $1 mark. Classic Bullish Divergence Points To Imminent Breakout According to technical analyst MasterAnanda on TradingView, the Polygon ecosystem token (POLUSDT) is currently flashing one of the strongest technical reversal signals in the form of a textbook bullish divergence on the 3-day chart. Price action hit a new low on April 7, 2025, but the Relative Strength Index (RSI) had already bottomed earlier in July 2024 and has since been forming higher lows. Related Reading: Polygon (MATIC) To Come back From The Dead As Ascending Triangle Appears As noted by the analyst, this mismatch between the price and the momentum indicator is a classic signal that the downtrend may be losing steam. The signal is reinforced by the recent increase in volume and the broader bullish recovery observed across the cryptocurrency market. Zooming in on the 3-day chart structure, POLUSDT experienced a notable rebound after reaching its low on April 7. The price climbed steadily to $0.267 by April 22 before encountering resistance. What followed were two successive bearish candlesticks that appeared to trace a measured pullback, likely a retest of the upper boundary of the descending channel. This movement is significant because retests of this nature often precede major breakouts. Keeping this in mind, the analyst predicted a successful bounce from the trendline support, which could start a sustained rally toward $1. Polygon To $1: Window Of Opportunity Narrowing Analyst MasterAnanda noted that the current price action is merely a calm before a massive move. “The market is giving us one last chance to buy all we want before massive growth,” the analyst said, implying that a strong impulsive wave could be next. The RSI is currently in the mid-40s, and if the bullish setup plays out, a swift move to the 70+ zone could occur. Related Reading: Polygon Price Risks Plunge With 90 Million MATIC Tokens Selling At $0.5 In terms of a price target, the analyst predicted a full recovery above $1 with a specific target of $1.15. This would mark a full recovery for POL holders who have been holding throughout the downturn in 2025. This level corresponds to the 1.618 level on the Fib extension projected from the April 7 low. The Fibonacci extension levels plotted on the chart show other smaller price targets on the way to $1.15. Most notable are the $0.461 and $0.534 regions, representing the 0.5 and 0.618 extension levels, respectively, which could serve as interim consolidation zones. At the time of writing, Polygon is trading at $0.2420.

Devin Nunes, the chief executive and chairman of the Trump Media & Technology Group (TMTG), says in a new shareholder letter that the firm is exploring a token and a “Truth digital wallet.” Nunes, a former member of Congress, says the token could be used to pay for Truth+ subscription costs and “later be applied to other products and services in the Truth ecosphere.” Trump’s controversial Solana ( SOL )-based memecoin, TRUMP , ticked down after the news. The 48th-ranked crypto asset by market cap is trading at $12.70 at time of writing and is down more than 7% in the past 24 hours. In January, TMTG announced a partnership with financial services giant Charles Schwab to launch Truth.Fi, a fintech firm with crypto services. As a means of diversifying the firm’s reserves, TMTG’s board has approved an investment of $250 million to be custodied by Charles Schwab, which could go toward investment vehicles, exchange-traded funds (ETFs), separately managed accounts (SMAs), as well as Bitcoin ( BTC ) and other digital assets. In the recent shareholder letter, Nunes says the first two Truth.Fi products will be slates of customized SMAs and ETFs. “Both products will have an America-First theme, focusing on a diverse set of companies across multiple industries, with the ETFs offering both cryptocurrencies and traditional equities. To launch our financial products, Trump Media partnered with top-quality companies that have great synergy with our business and vision. We’ve joined with Index Technologies Group and Yorkville America Equities to develop the SMAs, and with Crypto.com and Yorkville America Digital to develop the ETFs. Trump Media is planning to invest, alongside you, in these products via its own cash reserves.” Trump’s ventures in the crypto world have generated significant public criticism: Ethereum ( ETH ) founder Vitalik Buterin said earlier this year that political coins represented “vehicles for unlimited political bribery.” In a February letter to the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) and the Office of Government Ethics, officials at the nonprofit consumer advocacy organization Public Citizen argued that Trump’s memecoin could be in violation of federal law regulating gifts to government officials.

Unlike other L2 solutions, this project will not feature any token and depends solely on donations. The project’s devs even commented on the launch: “General-purpose L2s should be commodities — simple, replaceable, and free from centralized dependencies or risky governance. Ethereum R1 is our answer to that call. The roll-up grounded in credible neutrality, decentralization, and censorship resistance.” Ethereum’s transaction fees dropped to its lowest in five years in April ETH developers claimed that most current L2s work more similarly to new L1 projects than scaling solutions with private allocations, opaque governance, and centralized control. Lately, users have also raised concerns about how Ethereum L2 projects have drifted from the main interests of the base layer. The Ethereum R1 is a way to address all those issues, with the project team emphasizing that it will neither have venture funding nor any pre-mined token allocations or a governance token. The network had started to lay ground for new L2 projects much earlier. In March 2024, they released the Dencun upgrade, which reduced fees for its existing L2 scaling solutions. However, its base layer revenue had dwindled by nearly 100% by September of that year. Moreover, transaction fees on its base layer have continued to sink, reaching a five-year low of $0.16 per transaction in April 2025, primarily driven by reduced demand for block space. Some analysts have hinted that L2 growth incentives caused the base layer revenue declines, asking the network to reconsider its options. Ethereum’s dominance and demand is picking up In the past few months, the demand and relevance among new users for the ETH network have dropped. However, according to Growthepie, there was a 62% rise in active addresses week-on-week and another 57% surge in Layer 2 dominance. Recently, ETH had the highest market sentiment with 82%, while Solana and Bitcoin followed at only 3.6% and 2.7% respectively. In addition, Loookchain reported that crypto whales have been rushing to purchase ETH. In the last few hours, they acquired 5,362 ETH for over $7.2 million. One trader with the address ‘0xDdb4’ received a loan from Aave, about $3.44 million USDC from Aave, and purchased 1,856 ETH. Another whale, ‘0xf84d’, borrowed $1.64 million USDC, topped it up, and bought 1259 ETH with $2.34 million USDC. The other trader, ‘0x69D0’, took up 2,250 ETH worth around $4.12 million from the Binance crypto exchange. Ethereum flashes bottom signal as key metric hints at major rebound ahead Ethereum price was on a bullish path yesterday, May 1, after crossing above $1,850 for the first time in more than three weeks. The gains come amid chatter that ETH may have hit a local bottom, with key on-chain metrics supporting this hypothesis. ETH value today trades at $1,841 with a modest 2.56% gain in 24 hours. The uptrend coincides with a 60% spike in trading volumes as the market eagerly awaits whether a breakout above the psychological level of $2,000 will happen next. Ethereum has traded below the $2,000 level for most of the past two months. The price hit a low of below $1,400 on April 9. It had made something that amounted to a run to $1,550 and higher by April 22, though following a broad market lift on Bitcoin, it regained momentum. The ETH price, however, dipped again on April 30, falling to $1,736 within two hours. ETH price simply had more forced closures during this dip, topping $67 million compared to Bitcoin’s $64 million. Of the total $291 million, $48 million was on long positions, per Coinglass data . Such liquidations often lead to a rapid drop in price, ruining leveraged traders and short-term sentiment. Following this, Ethereum’s short-term chart has formed a head and shoulders pattern. This technical formation is usually connected to trend reversals and how traders will assess the upcoming price movement. Cryptopolitan Academy: Want to grow your money in 2025?

Kraken said in a May 1 report that its NinjaTrader acquisition would give its US customers access to the traditional derivatives market, aligning with its plans to expand its offerings and be the go-to platform for all types of trading. NinjaTrader is a registered Futures Commission Merchant with the Commodity Futures Trading Commission. Last month, it rolled out trading for over 11,000 stocks and exchange-traded funds to certain US clients. The deal, which Kraken dubbed the largest ever between a crypto and traditional finance firm, allows NinjaTrader to expand to the UK, continental Europe and Australian markets and comes as Kraken is preparing for an initial public offering in early 2026. The company is exploring a debt package worth between $200 million and $1 billion to facilitate that transaction. Kraken revenue, trading volume falls on Trump’s return Kraken’s $471.7 million revenue in Q1 marked a 19% increase from the year-ago quarter but a 6.8% fall from Q4 2024 . The exchange reported that trading volume fell 9.6% quarter-over-quarter to $208.7 billion while the value of its custodied assets fell 18% to $34.9 billion over the same time. Kraken attributed the drop to a “slowdown in overall market trading activity” as US President Donald Trump’s threats of implementing sweeping tariffs triggered an 18% fall in the crypto market cap over the quarter. Key metrics from Kraken’s Q1 report. Source: Kraken Kraken is one of several crypto platforms that saw record or near-record highs in trading activity in Q4 as Trump's November election win sparked larger-than-usual market volatility. Related: Kraken rolls out ETF and stock access for US crypto traders Kraken said that despite a “softening market,” its adjusted EBITDA — earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization — jumped 1% from the previous quarter to $187.4 million. The firm also saw the number of funded accounts on its platform increase 10% quarter-on-quarter to 3.9 million, signaling “deeper client engagement.” Reuters reported on April 18 that Kraken restructured its workforce after Arjun Sethi was appointed as co-CEO last October. Sethi has laid off around 400 employees since.

The regulatory challenges XRP faces diminish its potential as a top performer in 2025. Attention of traders now shifts toward Mutuum Finance (MUTM) since this DeFi project demonstrates fast growth beyond Ripple’s targets. The Mutuum Finance has gathered $7.3 million in funding since inception as it accumulated over 9,200 investors who have purchased tokens at $0.025 before the prospective 20% growth during the next phase. Investors who join today will receive a 140% return on investment by the time Mutuum Finance lists. MUTM gains potential for substantial upside potential while XRP stalls because investors are showing increased interest in the new asset. XRP Price Prediction: Will $5 to $7 be the Next Target for Ripple? Analysts predict XRP will experience a market-legendary price increase because it continues to expand despite regulatory hurdles towards reaching $5 value during the fourth quarter of 2025. XRP demonstrates promise through increasing institutional interest together with recent legal triumphs that will enable worldwide acceptance in financial services and technological markets. The worldwide status XRP establishes as a cross-border payments authority will help it soar to even greater elevation in its upcoming market cycle. The strong growth path of XRP meets competition from Mutuum Finance (MUTM) which shows rising popularity for its future market potential in 2025. Mutuum Finance Presale Gaining Momentum Currently at Phase 4, Mutuum Finance tokens are priced at $0.025. As the presale reaches Phase 5, the token price will rise to $0.03, giving early investors a built-in advantage. To further increase interaction, Mutuum Finance has recently launched a live leaderboard, highlighting the top 50 token holders. Those who are able to rank high will receive bonus tokens, adding a competitive, rewarding factor for early adopters. Mutuum Finance is innovative by combining the optimal elements of Peer-to-Contract (P2C) and Peer-to-Peer (P2P) lending models. In the P2C model, users lend stablecoins like USDT to smart contract-based liquidity pools and earn passive income while facilitating fast and secure borrowing. Conversely, in the P2P model, lenders and borrowers are directly connected, and therefore full confidentiality and greater control over terms are provided without employing any intermediary. This hybrid solution provides an equilibrium approach to decentralization, security, and efficiency and thus will attract both conservative investors who desire stable returns and those who seek greater freedom and flexibility. Designed for Stability and Security Stability together with security are central design objectives of Mutuum Finance since its foundation. The project delivers complete collateralization of its stablecoin by making it backed by the USD without algorithmic instabilities while ongoing smart contract audits and financial transparency commitments strengthen user trust and business sustainability. Mutuum Finance seeks community expansion through its $100,000 giveaway that gives each of ten winners $10,000 worth of MUTM tokens in addition to its referral program which rewards members who spread the network. Ripple (XRP) is primed for a breakout as it rides the momentum of increasing institutional adoption and a series of favorable court rulings, potentially reaching $5 to $7 by Q4 2025. As XRP surges, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is also emerging as a significant player in the DeFi space, offering early investors a rare opportunity with prices set to rise 20% in Phase 5. The combination of Ripple’s institutional push and Mutuum Finance’s innovative approach to decentralized lending makes these two assets worth watching closely in 2025.

Since then, the token has surged over 115%, marking a sharp and aggressive short-term uptrend. This rally reflects a growing appetite for risk among traders and renewed confidence across the broader crypto market. As major assets like Bitcoin and Ethereum consolidate near key resistance levels, smaller-cap tokens such as HYPE are gaining traction—benefiting from the increased momentum and speculative interest. Related Reading: Whales Sell 262,000 Ethereum Amid Recent Price Surge – Smart Exit Or Profit-Taking? Bulls are firmly in control, driving HYPE to test and reclaim critical technical levels. Top analyst Big Cheds shared a technical analysis on X, highlighting that HYPE is showing a strong response after retesting a key liquidity level. This price action, according to Cheds, may signal the beginning of a more sustained upward movement, especially if HYPE maintains its current structure and volume trends. With on-chain activity rising and market sentiment improving, all eyes are now on HYPE to see whether it can continue outperforming its peers. If bulls maintain momentum and reclaim higher resistance levels, HYPE could extend its rally and become one of the standout altcoin performers of the quarter. HYPE Eyes Breakout As Bulls Defend Key Levels HYPE continues to establish itself as one of the leading DeFi projects in the current market cycle, acting as a major decentralized exchange (DEX) with growing user activity and liquidity. After a strong run-up over the past few weeks, the token is now approaching a critical juncture as bulls attempt to reclaim the range highs and push through the psychological $20 resistance level. Despite recent bullish momentum, global macroeconomic uncertainty and rising geopolitical tensions are keeping the crypto market volatile, especially for altcoins. In this context, HYPE’s price action stands out. After a sharp move upward, the token faced a brief pullback, but according to Big Cheds, the response to this “throwback” was notably strong. The bounce from the $17 zone shows clear support, reinforcing buyer interest at these levels. Ched’s analysis suggests that this healthy retest of a previous liquidity pocket could fuel the next leg up. If bulls maintain control, HYPE could break through $20 and test the next significant supply zone above it. However, a short period of consolidation may be necessary to build enough momentum for the breakout. Related Reading: Solana Monthly Candle Reclaims Key Levels – Is $240 The Next Target? With fundamentals backing its growth and technicals flashing strength, HYPE is positioned as one of the key DeFi tokens to watch. A confirmed move above $20 could open the door to price discovery and cement HYPE’s leadership role among decentralized exchanges. Price Action Details: Holding A Bullish Structure HYPE is currently trading above $19 after a decisive move that pushed it beyond key short-term resistance. The token has shown strong momentum over the past two weeks, supported by growing market confidence and rising volume across decentralized finance platforms. Bulls are clearly in control, but the next major hurdle lies at the $22 level. Reclaiming $22 is critical for confirming a breakout and continuing the rally toward new all-time highs. This zone represents both psychological resistance and a historical supply region where sellers previously took profits. A clean push above $22 would likely trigger fresh buying and shift HYPE into price discovery mode. However, risks remain if momentum fades or broader market conditions weaken. The $17 level is now a key support zone to watch. If bulls lose control and price drops below that mark, HYPE could retrace further into lower demand zones, likely targeting the $14–$15 region. Related Reading: Ethereum Consolidates Against Bitcoin – Dominance Shift On The Horizon? For now, as long as HYPE holds above $19 and builds momentum, the bullish structure remains intact. The coming sessions will be crucial to determine whether the token has enough strength to clear $22 and continue leading the DeFi sector’s recovery.

Arbitrum, one of Ethereum’s leading layer 2 networks, has been actively distributing ARB tokens to support the development of its ecosystem. Its DAO has reportedly rolled out several hundred million dollars in grants, service provider funding, and incentives; however, according to Entropy Advisors, there has been little oversight on how these funds are actually spent. Interestingly, recent investigations have uncovered at least three separate incidents of grant misappropriation. One of them was the Furucombo case . The Arbitrum foundation accused Furucombo of misusing the backfund STIP grant after it failed to file a final report on how it spent the grant. Along with other transgressions, the Arbitrum DAO banned Furocombo from the DAO after extensive voting. Another case is the Gaming Catalyst Program (GCP), which received 225 million ARB worth approximately $215 million in early 2024. The GCP team is embroiled in allegations of misappropriation, underreporting and lack of transparency in its grant issuance, with a proposal launched to claw back funding. Recognizing the potential for further undiscovered abuses, Entropy Advisors proposed a system to enable the community to report misuse with the incentive of significant monetary rewards. The grant misuse bounty initiative proposed by Entropy Advisors has been tagged “The Watchdog.” In its proposal, Entropy Advisors defined the misuse of funds as “Any action or inaction by a recipient of DAO-allocated funds that directly violates the stated terms, objectives, agreement, or overall spirit of the allocation under which those funds were provided.” How the Watchdog program works The Watchdog program, which is proposed to operate like the more common bug bounty program, encourages community members to report inappropriate use of DAO funds privately through GlobaLeaks, the open-source whistleblowing platform used by governments, NGOs, and investigative journalists. As stated in the proposal, all submissions are private and secure, and whistleblowers can earn between $5,000 and $100,000 per confirmed report, with payouts determined by the severity of the violation and the quality of evidence provided. The process begins with a confidential submission of findings to a review committee, composed of members from Entropy Advisors, Arbitrum Foundation, and SeedGov. The committee of reviewers then go on to test the validity of the submission and also determine the severity of the misuse of funds. The severity, which ranges from low to high, in turn determines the amount that will be paid out to the whistleblower. For low severity submissions, whistleblowers can get a base payout of 1,000 ARB, which is deducted from the recovered funds if applicable, with the total possible reward being capped at $10,000. For cases with medium severity, the proposed bounty is a base payout of 10,000 ARB, and the maximum reward yield in the category is $25,000. Finally, for cases that rank high in order of severity, the bounty prize is a base payout of 30,000 ARB, while the maximum payout here is capped at $100,000. Cases like that of Furocombo fall under the medium category due to severity, as it involved the misuse of DAO-allocated funds that impacted the DAO’s resources. Proposed timelines for implementation The proposed launch date for the Watchdog bounty program is the end of May, with the Entropy Advisors proposal being subject to on-chain voting from May 8 to May 22. The results of the voting will greatly impact the program‘s launch date. Entropy Advisors also propose that an initial 400,000 ARB tokens be allocated to fund the program. According to them, the implementation of this program will not only deter malicious actions and actors, but it will also attract sophisticated on-chain sleuths and investigators to Arbitrum.

The company says its decision is less about TRUMP or cryptocurrency and more about the upcoming U.S.-Mexico tariffs that threaten business needs. TRUMP meme coin faces scrutiny over potential misuse of president’s crypto wealth The TRUMP meme coin has been controversial since its launch. Much of the President’s cash is wrapped up in crypto. An influential group of experts and former regulators have said the coin raises concerns about potential misuse. Freight Technologies announcing they plan to spend $20 million on constructing TRUMP Treasury has only added to that concern. The company’s press release provides insight into the investment’s reasoning. While it briefly touches on Freight’s interest in AI and Web3 technologies, the main focus is on how U.S.-Mexico trade tariffs might affect the company: “At the heart of our mission is the promotion of productive and active commerce between the United States and Mexico. Mexico is the United States’ top goods trading partner. We believe that adding Official TRUMP tokens is an effective way to advocate for fair, balanced, and free trade between Mexico and the U.S.,” said CEO Javier Selgas. Freight Technologies’ investment sparks speculation over U.S.-Mexico tariffs and stock slide Freight Technologies plays a key role in cross-border shipping with Mexico and is using AI to optimize trade between the two nations. The company sees the potential for a trade war with Mexico to disrupt its operations severely. Although President Trump has previously granted tariff exemptions to certain businesses, the company’s statement does not specifically appeal to him for such a carve-out. Reports suggest that some crypto companies received indirect legal benefits after donating to Trump’s inauguration fund, with some donations as small as $100,000. So, could Freight’s $20 million investment make an impression? While it’s hard to make definitive claims, the company’s actions surrounding the TRUMP deal raise eyebrows—the majority of its reasoning for the purchase centers on U.S.-Mexico trade relations. The press release briefly mentions that the TRUMP tokens could help diversify the company’s crypto holdings, but this is the only mention unrelated to tariffs. Suppose Freight Technologies is indeed attempting to influence the President. In that case, it seems likely that the company would prefer the Mexico tariffs to be removed entirely, not just seek an exemption for itself. At any rate, this TRUMP buy could prove to be bad news for Freight’s stock. The press release was first written on the 30th of April but attracted much attention in the crypto circles on the 1st of May. As the headlines spread, the company’s stock plunged more than 20%. This is one to watch closely. More companies are creating Strategy-style plans around cryptocurrencies. Freight Technologies may be among the first, but they likely won’t be the last. Trump’s meme coin surges 58% after exclusive dinner invitation to top holders President Trump’s meme coin, which had dropped 88% from its recent peak, experienced a surge last Wednesday after the coin’s website invited the top 220 holders of the digital token to an “intimate private dinner” with the president. Following the dinner invitation posted on the $TRUMP meme coin website and Twitter account, the coin’s value spiked by $5.32, or 58%, reaching $14.32 by Wednesday afternoon. This increase, however, only partially offset the coin’s significant drop from its high of $75.35 on January 19, the day before Trump’s inauguration. The dinner invitation promises $TRUMP coin investors the chance to “Hear close-up, from President Trump, about the future of Crypto!” Trump, who has expressed plans to make the U.S. the global cryptocurrency hub, has also launched several digital ventures, including NFTs branded as “Trump digital trading cards” and a cryptocurrency platform called World Liberty Financial. According to the Trump coin website, CIC Digital LLC, an affiliate of The Trump Organization, and Fight Fight Fight LLC together hold 80% of the meme coin supply. Fight Fight Fight is a Delaware-based LLC, as reported by the Wall Street Journal. Cryptopolitan Academy: Tired of market swings? Learn how DeFi can help you build steady passive income.

This is the question defining early 2025. Bitcoin holds the $100K zone with RSI strength and rising institutional inflows. On one end, Bitcoin is surging again, with strong accumulation zones and bullish structures attracting institutional momentum. On the other hand, some are looking beyond charts—into projects that solve real problems, not just dominate newsfeeds. This is where Qubetics ($TICS) rises above the noise. While legacy networks struggle with scaling issues or a narrow focus, Qubetics is building real tools for real-world use. From cross-border automation to decentralized development infrastructure, it’s not chasing a trend—it’s engineering the backbone for tomorrow’s digital economy. And judging by the numbers, the community is taking notice. Bitcoin Stalls Near $95K — Is the Next Bitcoin Price Prediction Calling for $138K? Bitcoin entered Q2 2025 with renewed strength, trading just above $109,000 after breaking out of its March consolidation zone with a sharp 12% gain. Analysts now view the $115,000 to $118,500 region as the next central resistance zone, with key Fibonacci levels projecting breakout targets at $124,300 and $138,000. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) remains near 61, well within healthy territory, indicating that Bitcoin still has room to run before reaching exhaustion. Beyond charts and indicators, Bitcoin’s structural appeal has been reignited by strong macro signals. ETF inflows are rising sharply, supported by newly proposed reserve policies in multiple economic blocs. The supply of BTC on exchanges has dropped to its lowest point in over three years, creating a liquidity crunch just as demand accelerates. This tightening supply dynamic is reinforcing the bullish thesis, particularly among large funds seeking long-term hedges in a volatile global economy. Cycle-based models are now forecasting a potential peak above $150,000 by Q4 2025, echoing the historic blow-off top pattern observed after previous halvings. On the technical front, Bitcoin is trading within a bullish flag formation on the weekly chart, with its lower support at $101,200 and a resistance trendline that is climbing toward $133,000. If current macroeconomic conditions persist, particularly with global de-dollarization trends and increasing rate volatility, Bitcoin’s narrative as a non-sovereign store of value is likely to fuel continued accumulation. Traders and analysts alike are treating this cycle not as speculative noise but as a strategic build-up toward a long-awaited parabolic leg. In short, Bitcoin’s price prediction narrative is no longer just about volatility—it’s about validation. Market Impact: Bitcoin’s Strength Validates the Entire Crypto Asset Class Bitcoin (BTC) is trading at approximately $95,177, representing a modest 0.42% increase over the past 24 hours. Bitcoin’s current structure—trading within a bullish flag and witnessing a sharp drop in exchange-held supply—signals far more than just price movement. It reflects a fundamental shift in how institutional capital is treating Bitcoin: not as a speculative asset, but as a strategic, non-sovereign store of value. As ETF inflows continue to grow and reserve frameworks around Bitcoin emerge across multiple economic regions, BTC is increasingly being viewed as a foundational asset for macro portfolios. This structural confidence is not only reinforcing Bitcoin’s dominance—it’s validating the entire crypto asset class. Bitcoin’s liquidity profile, combined with its proven monetary policy and historical track record, positions it as the benchmark against which all other digital assets are measured. Its price movement no longer represents short-term market sentiment; it sets the tone for regulatory clarity, sovereign adoption, and global financial evolution. In 2025, Bitcoin is no longer fighting for legitimacy. It has it. And in doing so, it anchors the credibility of decentralized finance at large, sending a clear signal to capital markets that blockchain is no longer a fringe experiment—it’s becoming economic infrastructure. Qubetics: Solving Real Problems with Real Tools Qubetics is a Layer 1 blockchain designed not just to compete, but to simplify and scale what previous blockchains couldn’t. At the center of its utility engine is QubeQode, a low-code tool that lets users deploy smart contracts and decentralized applications without deep programming expertise. Unlike platforms that demand months of Solidity training, QubeQode offers drag-and-drop modules and visual scripting, helping businesses and professionals build systems like tokenized payroll, supply chain tracking, or royalty-based digital publishing in a fraction of the time. Backing this tool is the Qubetics IDE, an integrated development environment built to empower blockchain developers with faster workflows, real-time error detection, and native deployment across multiple chains. Whether it’s building a finance app or automating digital identity management, the Qubetics IDE turns technical complexity into operational clarity. The platform’s traction speaks volumes. Qubetics is in its 32nd presale stage. The token price stands at $0.2093. Over 510 million $TICS tokens have already been sold, drawing participation from more than 25,500 holders. The presale tally has now crossed $16.5 million, a clear indicator of strong confidence and growing market attention. This isn’t just another speculative cycle—it’s functional infrastructure in motion. If the token hits $1, it brings a 378% return. At $5, that rises to 2,289%. A post-mainnet value of $15 would mark a staggering 7,066% ROI. These aren’t just theoretical multipliers; they’re the result of product-driven traction and real-world use. What Experts Are Saying About Qubetics: Can $2,000 Morph Into $143K by Mainnet? It’s not just hype—it’s math backed by momentum. With Qubetics ($TICS) sitting at $0.2093 in its 32nd presale stage, a $2,000 entry bags roughly 9,555 tokens. If $TICS hits just $1 after the presale, that stack turns into $9,555—already a 378% gain. Push that to $5, and it rockets to $47,775. But it doesn’t stop there. If Qubetics climbs to $10, you’re looking at $95,550. And if the project reaches $15 post-mainnet, that same $2,000 could explode into $143,325. Conclusion: Two Giants, Two Paths—Same Destination? Bitcoin and Qubetics operate on different frequencies. One is the standard-bearer, built on scarcity and trust. The other is a rising infrastructure project focused on usability and technological empowerment. But in 2025, both are showing why they matter. Bitcoin commands attention through strength, legacy, and tightening supply dynamics. The price action aligns with institutional adoption, and its evolving regulatory clarity adds fire to the Bitcoin price prediction narrative. Meanwhile, Qubetics doesn’t just promise—it delivers. With QubeQode and its full-stack IDE, it lowers the barrier to blockchain creation, expands use cases, and secures massive ROI potential through real-world engagement. For community members looking to be part of meaningful innovation, not just watch it, Qubetics offers an entry point backed by more than hype. For those seeking foundational digital assets with liquidity and legacy, Bitcoin continues to prove it still sets the tone. Both offer unique strengths—but only one still gives early access. The Qubetics crypto presale isn’t open forever. Bitcoin isn’t staying cheap forever. Timing, as always, decides the outcome.

Kraken said the applicant’s red flags appeared early on in the process when they joined an interview under a name different from what they applied with and “occasionally switched between voices,” apparently being guided through the interview. Rather than immediately rejecting the applicant, Kraken decided to advance them through its hiring process to gather information about the tactics used. International sanctions have effectively cut North Korea off from the rest of the world, and the country’s ruling Kim family dictatorship has long targeted crypto companies and users to top up the country’s coffers. It’s stolen billions worth of crypto so far this year. Kraken reported that industry partners had tipped them off that North Korean actors were actively applying for jobs at crypto companies. “We received a list of email addresses linked to the hacker group, and one of them matched the email the candidate used to apply to Kraken,” it said. With this information, the firm’s security team uncovered a network of fake identities used by the hacker to apply to multiple companies. Kraken also noted technical inconsistencies, which included the use of remote Mac desktops through VPNs and altered identification documents.

North Korean-linked hackers also stole more than $650 million through multiple crypto heists during 2024, while deploying IT workers to infiltrate blockchain and crypto companies as insider threats, according to a statement released by the US, Japan and South Korea in January. In April, a subgroup of Lazarus was found to have set up three shell companies , with two in the US, to deliver malware to unsuspecting users and scam crypto developers.

The meme coin failed to break a significant resistance level that contains a huge chunk of all SHIB coins in circulation, as per market information. Related Reading: Only XRP?

Almost 40% of those who own the dog-themed cryptocurrency are in profit at present. A breakout above $0.000014 would reverse this figure, leaving the majority of SHIB owners in profitable positions for the first time in weeks. Price Stuck In Narrow Trading Range The meme coin now trades within a tight 24-hour price range of $0.0000130 to $0.00001374, according to recent charts from IntoTheBlock. While prices are consolidating, some large investors seem to be adding more. The Chaikin Money Flow (CMF) indicator has once again turned positive, indicating renewed buying by deep-pocketed traders. Although it has risen more than 10% this month, technical indicators are sending mixed signals. The Stochastic Relative Strength Index is between 11 and 9, indicating SHIB may be trading below what experts view as its fair market value. This is even as trading volumes have fallen in recent days. Massive One-Day Token Burn Raises Eyebrows Meanwhile, more than 280 million SHIB tokens were irreversibly taken out of circulation in one day. Based on tracking platform Shibburn, this is a 38,299% rise in the burn rate – an unprecedented increase that surprised many market observers. Source: Shibburn Related Reading: Code Wars: Cardano Claims The Crown From Ethereum In Core Development This drastic burn lowers the circulating supply to around 584 trillion tokens. The SHIB community has long advocated for token burning as a means of inducing scarcity, which in theory would drive up the value of existing coins by lowering supply. The recent burn is a stark reversal following weeks of declining token removal rates. This is seen by some as a sign of renewed confidence among “whales,” or large investors, as well as smaller token holders, but others caution that burn rates alone do not necessarily indicate price ascent. Market participants are now closely monitoring if the synergy of technicals, increasing whale appetite, and token burning aggression will be enough for SHIB to break its strong resistance levels. With general market sentiment picking up in cryptocurrencies, the next couple of weeks could be crucial for the direction of the price of the popular meme token.

The proposal, posted on May 1 to Sky’s decentralized autonomous organization ( DAO ) forum, would see the Sky (SKY) token take over the Maker (MKR) token as the protocol’s governance token. If the DAO accepts, the change would be slated to take place around May 15 to May 19 and downgrading from SKY to MKR would also be disabled. Sky co-founder Rune Christensen said in response to the proposal that it was a “huge milestone,” which he “fully supports,” and laments that allowing users to downgrade from SKY back to MKR has been a “key limiting factor preventing exchanges from adopting SKY.” “With this change, exchanges are likely to move faster in quickly adopting SKY without concerns about fracturing liquidity,” he said. Source: Sky Penalties on MKR holders who are slow in switching to SKY have also been proposed. According to the proposal, a 1% delayed upgrade penalty would apply to all MKR to SKY upgrades starting Sept. 18, increasing every three months. Users hit with a delayed upgrade penalty will also obtain fewer SKY tokens. Sky staking, temporary pause on liquidations Christensen said the most important change would be to see SKY staking enabled as part of the changes to the protocol. Rewards for its decentralized stablecoin , USDS, which are based on the income the Sky Protocol generates, will be enabled two or three weeks after the upgrade of the governance contract, with a splitter rate of 50%, according to Christensen. Source: Rune Christensen “Getting past the full upgrade of MKR to SKY is one of the last pieces missing before Sky can transition to 0 fixed costs at the end of 2025, which will ensure an even greater portion of the income the protocol generates goes to the benefit of SKY buybacks, or SKY Staking Rewards,” he said. SKY liquidations will also be temporarily disabled while the one-way MKR to SKY transition is still in its early stages. Related: Sky doubles down on token overhaul: Making MKR unusable, launching subDAOs “This is necessary to prevent risk from price manipulation to the SKY and MKR price while the transition is happening,” Christensen said. “When SKY market liquidity is restored, Sky Governance will lift the liquidation freeze and move risk parameters to long-term targets,” he added. Maker rebranded to Sky in August last year but after confusion and negative feedback, Christensen considered going back to the original Maker name just months later. However, a November poll saw 79% of tokenholders vote to keep the Sky brand as the back end protocol brand with no further changes.

Market analysts are watching closely, as recent movements have opened up the possibility of further gains. Looking at the 4-day chart, an analyst has said that there are two main possible scenarios for XRP’s price direction: 1. The Yellow Scenario (More Likely) This scenario shows XRP continuing to rise, possibly reaching a new all-time high before undergoing a major correction. This structure follows a pattern of five waves that started from XRP’s low in 2013. If this plays out, a correction could follow, possibly pulling the price down to $0.40–$0.50, similar to past market behavior. 2. The White Scenario (Alternative) This scenario shows that the current bull market actually started in 2020, not 2013. XRP is possibly in the final wave of a smaller five-wave move. If true, a smaller but still significant correction could follow, possibly lasting up to a year. Despite the uncertainty, both scenarios expect another price increase, especially while XRP holds above the key support level of $1.20. If this happens, XRP could rise to $5.60 or even $6.60. Short-Term Outlook From a shorter-term perspective, XRP appears to be forming a five-wave move up from its April low. However, the pattern is not yet clear. If XRP stays above $2.12, prices could continue to rise. But if it drops below that level, we may see a correction with support between $1.84 and $2.10.",News|Altcoins|Crypto news|Price Analysis|Ripple (XRP),EN,0,0,ALTCOIN|MARKET|TRADING|XRP,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-05-02 03:01:35

April's on-chain data shows a decline in Bitcoin's Monthly Active Addresses, indicating a dwindling user base, partly due to ETF adoption. Bitcoin mining sector faces profitability challenges despite high BTC prices, with global hash rate growth and low fees impacting long-term security and decentralization. Gold has outperformed Bitcoin since 2021, but recent demand flow data suggests a potential capital rotation favoring Bitcoin in the short to medium term. My early-February call for 'beast mode ' in Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) and by extension the Fidelity Wise Origin Bitcoin Fund ETF ( FBTC ) was not well-timed. This was acknowledged later when I followed that piece up with a late-February article titled ""Turns Out, Bitcoin's Beast Was a Bear."" More recently, 'investor demand' for BTC has improved if ETF inflows are any indication. In this update, we'll look at April network data, the mining sector, and what (if any) relationship there is between Bitcoin and Gold ( XAUUSD:CUR ) that could foreshadow a larger capital rotation. On-Chain Data: April 2025 The on-chain metrics that I typically pay attention to when drawing my own assessment of Bitcoin's 'network health' are things like fees, daily active addresses, and transferred value. In April, Monthly Active Addresses came in at 10.9 million. This was flat month over month and down 14% year over year. Bitcoin DAAs vs MAAs (Token Terminal) The Token Terminal chart above shows Bitcoin user data expressed through both Daily Active Addresses (or DAAs) and Monthly Active Addresses (or MAAs). Though the trends are very similar, the MAA trend (green line) shows a peak in monthly active addresses in January 2021. Daily Active Addresses actually peaked in September 2023. The point is, we could easily argue Bitcoin is exhibiting a dwindling user base, since monthly unique addresses have been trending down through this halving cycle. Admittedly, some of this is due to 'adoption' taking place through ETFs rather than on-chain. We'll get into the ETF data in a later section. USD Transferred Value (CoinMetrics) At $9.9 billion in 30-day average transferred value, Bitcoin is still a highly functioning blockchain. However, the payment to miners for validating that transferred value continues to be underwhelming to say the least: Monthly Mining Fees (Token Terminal) At $15.7 million in fees for the month, April saw a 4% increase over March and a whopping 94% decline in full-month fees year over year. To be fair, April 2024 was the third-best month ever for Bitcoin miners from a fee-generation standpoint. But I can't stress enough that the lack of fees is a long-term problem for Bitcoin due to the limited supply of coins. Mining Industry Health It's easy to hand-wave away the importance of fees long term due to the fact that Bitcoin has always produced a new all-time high price following a halving event. In theory, the perpetual increase in the price of BTC offsets the reduction of fresh supply from block reward emissions. In reality, Bitcoin's price increase in this halving cycle arguably hasn't been enough to justify the global hashrate growth that we've seen since the halving in April 2024: Rewards USD vs BTC (mempool.space) The chart above shows Bitcoin mining rewards measured in both BTC (in yellow) and US dollars (in green). Yellow gets cut in half every four years. That matters less than the dollar-denominated rewards for miners, since mining expenses are denominated in fiat rather than BTC. A year after the halving in 2020, Bitcoin's dollar-denominated rewards were essentially at all-time highs. A year following the 2024 halving, Bitcoin's dollar denominated rewards are actually below that 2021 high. This wouldn't be as big of an issue for miners if the global hash rate was holding steady or even going down. The opposite is true: Data by YCharts Though it is admittedly off recent highs, Bitcoin's global hash rate has grown by 40% over the last twelve months. The result of which is a mining sector profitability figure that remains significantly depressed at just $49 per PHS/Day: Bitcoin Hashprice, 5 Year Trend (Hashrate Index) If you're looking for a reason why Bitcoin mining stocks are still well below their highs from the last cycle even with Bitcoin at $87k per coin, the chart above is a big part of your answer. To be sure, there are long-term implications to Bitcoin's security if mining can't be done profitability, and I'd wager one of those implications is the centralization of global hash. Consider that public mining companies can and have generally funded expansion through shareholder dilution rather than by efficiently running an operation. Smaller/private mining companies don't necessarily have that luxury. Unlike Gold, which does not require miners to exist for the movement/settlement of previously mined metal, Bitcoin's decentralized ledger does require validation from miners to create new blocks. This is one of the critical reasons why I don't think Bitcoin will overtake Gold in terms of market capitalization in my lifetime. But that doesn't mean the current setup can't favor Bitcoin for a capital rotation trade shorter to medium term. Rotation Trade Setup Gold has absolutely proven its value as a safe haven asset over the last three years. From the 2022 low to the 2025 high, Gold has more than doubled in price. For an asset with a multi-trillion market capitalization, this type of move in price is quite impressive. Gold has done so well since 2022, that we currently have a Bitcoin/Gold ratio that is below the 2021 peak of 36: Bitcoin/Gold Ratio (LongTermTrends.net) To be sure, this ratio did indeed make a new high of 40 in late 2024. But at the current 28 reading in the ratio, Gold has actually outperformed Bitcoin since November 2021. Even though Bitcoin has often been dubbed 'digital Gold,' the 30-day average correlation between the two had actually been negative for two straight months earlier this year. 30 Day Pearson (The Block) That has since reversed, and we currently find BTC and Gold with their tightest 30-day average correlation in 3 months. This comes with Gold beginning to show signs of temporary bull exhaustion and Bitcoin breaking out over technical resistance in late-April.

Once driven purely by internet culture and speculation, it now represents a complex trading environment with increasing institutional presence, data-driven strategies and measurable risk factors. In this market, individual traders often face diminishing returns. Narratives move faster than most can react to, and access to real-time data is now a minimum requirement. In 2025, successful participation in memecoin cycles requires not only infrastructure but also a clear framework for evaluating assets before engaging with them. The following metrics represent a baseline for assessing viability in today’s memecoin landscape. Whale and smart money wallet tracking – T he foundation of signal-based trading Large wallets – commonly referred to as whales – continue to serve as early indicators of sentiment shifts in the memecoin market. However, simply replicating their trades without looking at smart money trades has proven ineffective. Instead, data should be used to identify patterns of behavior. Wallets with a verifiable profit history over the past 30 days, ideally showing a 30–100% return on capital, tend to offer more reliable signals. Greater significance is typically assigned to those whose average trade size exceeds $5,000, suggesting a higher level of conviction. Tools that provide real-time monitoring of wallet activity can offer valuable context and alerts. Tokens that attract multiple large transactions – $30,000 and above – from such wallets within a short timeframe are more likely to reflect emerging trends, whereas isolated transactions may not be meaningful. This type of monitoring often provides a more accurate picture of market sentiment than technical indicators alone. Social attention – Without visibility, there’s limited traction For memecoins to gain traction, visibility remains a core requirement. A verified and active X account has become a minimum benchmark for credibility. While follower count is less important than engagement metrics, a baseline of consistent activity and community response indicates a functioning marketing effort – a n essential element in memecoin dynamics. Also, tracking the volume and velocity of social media mentions remains one of the most effective tools for early signal detection. Rather than focusing on absolute numbers, traders monitor acceleration – how quickly a token gains traction across platforms such as X, Telegram and Reddit. An emerging metric, velocity score, measures the rate of increase in mentions over short timeframes of approximately three-hour windows. Tokens showing sharp upward trends in social engagement often experience price movement shortly thereafter. Liquidity – C ritical to mitigating price manipulation Liquidity acts as a buffer against volatility. Low-liquidity coins may offer sharp upside during peak momentum but carry significantly higher downside risk. In 2025, experienced traders tend to avoid tokens with total liquidity below $150,000 unless paired with unusually high short-term volume and whale activity. As a general rule – $500,000 to $2 million liquidity represents a stable range for entry in mid-cap cycles. Pools above $5 million are less likely to deliver sharp price appreciation but provide higher security against slippage and coordinated manipulation. Token supply and holder distribution – A ssessing structural risk Tokens without clear developer burn mechanisms are increasingly viewed as unsustainable. If the founding team retains a significant portion of the supply and no verifiable burn events have occurred post-launch, long-term investor confidence is unlikely. Equally important is wallet concentration. In practice, a top 10 wallet group holding more than 20% of the total supply is viewed as a structural weakness. A more distributed supply generally correlates with reduced volatility and greater resilience to coordinated exits. Trading volume – A proxy for health and sustainability Consistent trading volume is essential for risk mitigation. In today’s environment, memecoins trading below $250,000 daily for more than 48 hours are generally considered inactive or abandoned. Conversely, volumes above $2 million indicate active cycles and more reliable liquidity across exchanges. And rising prices without matching volume tend to signal short-term exit activity rather than genuine interest. Understanding the game – T rading reflexivity, not fundamentals Unlike traditional assets, memecoins derive much of their value from reflexivity – the cycle of belief and price movement. That said, traders are buying tokens not for their intrinsic value but for the likelihood that others will buy after them. Success in this market depends on recognizing behavioral patterns, identifying when others will act and entering before broader momentum builds. Attempting this solo is increasingly ineffective. In 2025, the most competitive edge comes from collaboration – small trading groups with defined roles (on-chain analysis, social metrics, liquidity tracking, etc.) – outperform isolated participants consistently. Ultimately, memecoin trading has evolved into a highly specialized activity, demanding structured analysis, real-time infrastructure and shared insights. For those unwilling or unable to approach it at this level, passive exposure may be the more rational path.

At the moment, Bitcoin is trading just under $97,000. It recently broke through the $96,000 level and is showing signs of strength on the daily and weekly charts. Some price pullbacks are still expected, but the overall trend remains upward. Analysts are now watching closely for the next major price levels as this rally could drive the entire crypto market higher. In the second quarter of 2025, Bitcoin is showing strong bullish indicators. It recently cleared its 200-day moving average and is building strong support. Additional support levels at $95,797 and $96,441 are also being monitored as part of a broader bullish structure. According to an analyst, a sustained drop below $95,280 could signal the early stages of a larger correction, but as of now, Bitcoin remains firmly above that threshold. If buying pressure resumes, short-term targets to the upside include $97,325, $98,745, and the psychological milestone of $100,000. These levels represent areas of potential resistance based on recent price dynamics. The larger trend remains constructive, with bulls aiming for a continuation of the uptrend toward the $115,000–$120,000 range later this cycle—provided current support zones hold. Market Outlook: More Gains Ahead? The strong Bitcoin rally could push other cryptocurrencies like Ethereum, XRP, and Solana higher as well. This pattern, seen in past bull markets, usually starts with Bitcoin leading the way, followed by altcoins gaining momentum as investor money spreads across the market. While pullbacks are expected — since prices never go up in a straight line — many experts believe the market is setting up for another major run. A key support level to watch is $95,280. As long as Bitcoin stays above this, there’s a chance for more upside.",News|Bitcoin|Crypto news|Price Analysis,EN,0,0,ALTCOIN|BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|TRADING,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-05-02 03:41:04

In a written statement , the Commerce Ministry in Beijing said it had “taken note” that senior US officials have repeated their wish to speak with China about the tariffs. “The United States has recently sent messages to China through relevant parties, hoping to start talks with China,” the ministry said. “China is currently evaluating this.” The statement urged officials in the US capital to match their words with “sincerity.” The note gave financial markets fresh hope that the trade standoff between the world’s two largest economies might ease. Futures on the S&P 500 Index wiped out earlier losses during Asian hours, and a widely watched yardstick of regional shares moved into positive territory. Hong Kong’s Hang Seng China Enterprises Index climbed more than 1 percent, while mainland exchanges stayed shut for a holiday. In currency trading, the offshore yuan rose 0.3 percent to 7.2566 per dollar, and the Australian dollar extended its rebound. Talks would mark a shift in a dispute that has rattled businesses on both sides of the Pacific. Last month, Trump pushed import taxes on a broad range of Chinese goods to levels unseen in 100 years, and Beijing retaliated by raising its own tariffs. The U.S. president has said several times that Chinese leader Xi Jinping needs to contact him first if Beijing truly wants to bargain. Earlier this week, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent told reporters that China must take the initial step to break the stalemate. “The high level of reciprocal tariffs on China is not sustainable, so the market expects the U.S. and China to start negotiating at some point,” said Woei Chen Ho, economist at United Overseas Bank Ltd. “The beginning of negotiations will likely drive market volatility again because it is not expected to be plain sailing.” Political moves in Washington could complicate the path forward On Thursday, Trump reshuffled top national‑security posts, expanding Secretary of State Marco Rubio’s duties. Rubio, who became the first US cabinet member sanctioned by Beijing, will act as interim national security adviser while keeping his State Department portfolio. Michael Waltz, the outgoing adviser, will be nominated as US ambassador to the United Nations. Holding both jobs will give Rubio a louder voice on matters that Beijing follows closely, including Taiwan, which China regards as its own territory. The secretary of state has pledged in the past to counter what he calls China’s “destabilizing actions” in the South China Sea. In an interview broadcast Thursday night on Fox News with host Sean Hannity, Rubio said Chinese officials are looking for a “short‑term accommodation” and that the US duties are “taking a huge toll” on China’s economy. “The Chinese are reaching out,” Rubio told Hannity. “They want to meet, they want to talk.” Marco Rubio in a recent interview with Hannity on Fox News. Source: Fox News The White House, the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative, and the Departments of Treasury and Commerce did not answer requests for comment on Friday. Economic pressure inside China is mounting. The official manufacturing purchasing managers’ index released this week showed factory activity sinking into its deepest contraction since December 2023. New export orders fell to the lowest level since December 2022 and recorded their steepest one‑month drop since April 2022, when Shanghai shut down to control a pandemic outbreak. Even while hinting at openness, the Commerce Ministry framed its view as unchanged. As a condition for any talks, the ministry said Washington must first “correct its wrong practices” by lifting the unilateral tariffs. “If we fight, we will fight to the end; if we talk, the door is open,” the statement said. It said, “What China wants to emphasize is that in any possible dialogue or talks, if the United States does not correct its wrong unilateral tariff measures, it means that the United States has no sincerity at all and will further damage the mutual trust between the two sides.” Cryptopolitan Academy: Want to grow your money in 2025?

""The U.S. has proactively reached out to China through multiple channels, hoping to hold discussions on the tariff issue,"" China state media posted on social media . Dogecoin (DOGE) led gains among majors with a 4% rise in the past 24 hours. Cardano's ADA, XRP, ether (ETH) and BNB rose between 1-3%, with the broad-based CoinDesk 20 (CD20) rising 2.2%. Movement's MOVE extended losses to 21% as the company confirmed founder Rushi Manche had been suspended following a CoinDesk exposé of possible token manipulation involving the 21-year-old. On Polymarket, bettors are skeptical that a deal will come this month, giving it only a 20% chance of happening by June. Bettors are likely concerned that the hawkish rhetoric from the White House means a deal may take longer than a month to be reached. The speed and intensity of the tariffs the White House announced earlier this year panicked the market, leading to a significant drop in BTC's price, but with this apparent trade detente, $100,000 bitcoin is back on the agenda. Other crypto metrics are looking healthy, market observers say, putting $100K bitcoin in sight. ""Momentum continues to build across crypto with spot flows broadening, alt activity heating up and subtle but meaningful shifts in market structure,"" trading and technology group Flowdesk said in a recent market note. ""As BTC ranges above $90K, undercurrents of risk appetite are growing stronger within both spot and derivative markets. Liquidity remains strong with rising volumes, surging weekend activity, and improving altcoin depth. At the same time, broad-based spot buying continues, led by speculative alts and AI tokens, alongside $1.5B in Bitcoin ETF inflows as institutional demand grows,"" Flowdesk also wrote. The market is also likely optimistic about Strategy's continued BTC buys, and push towards further institutionalization. As CoinDesk recently reported , Michael Saylor announced that Strategy is raising $21 billion for more BTC buys. In a recent note , Presto Research said investors are increasingly impressed by Strategy’s growing institutional sophistication, highlighted by new valuation frameworks like BTC Torque and a strong focus on accurately pricing its fixed-income instruments. Kava milestone pushes AI tokens higher Artificial Intelligence (AI) tokens are in the green on Friday as the market reacts positively to news from Kava Labs that it hit 100K users of its decentralized AI platform. Data from CoinGecko shows the market segment is up 3%, beating the CoinDesk 20 , a measure of the performance of the largest digital assets, which is up by 1.8%. ""People are turning to Kava AI because it offers two things most platforms don’t, verifiability and privacy,"" Kava Labs' Scott Stuart said to CoinDesk in an email. ""That includes users who are deeply embedded in Web3 as well as those simply seeking an alternative to opaque, centralized AI systems."" Interest in Kava and decentralized AI growing globally, Stuart said, as more users recognize the value of AI that’s both decentralized and transparent, not reliant on a black-box model governed by a handful of corporations.",Markets|btc|Bitcoin|News,EN,0,0,ADA|ASIA|BTC|MARKET|TRADING,"{'name': 'CoinDesk', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/5/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coindesk,2025-05-02 05:04:57

A Long-Term Bitcoin Accumulation Strategy Outlined in its latest financial disclosure, TBG’s strategy focuses on an incremental acquisition approach. The company aims to increase its current holdings of 620 BTC to between 1,000 and 3,000 BTC by the end of this year. It has set an ambitious mid-term goal of owning 100,000 BTC by 2032 and hopes to reach between 170,000 and 260,000 BTC by 2034. “If Bitcoin reaches €1-2 million per coin by 2033-2035, holding 210,000 BTC could represent between €210 billion and €420 billion in net asset value,” the report states. This long-term vision is underpinned by a projection that Bitcoin’s value will appreciate substantially in the coming years. To measure progress, the company is tracking its proprietary “BTC Yield” metric, which saw a dramatic 709% increase in Q1 2025. During this period, its Bitcoin-per-share figure jumped from 41 to 332 satoshis. Strategic Backing and Funding Pipeline The firm, which trades under the ticker ALTBG on Euronext Growth Paris, underwent a strategic pivot in November 2024 to become a full-fledged Bitcoin Treasury Company. Since then, it has boosted its Bitcoin reserves significantly—from just 15 BTC in December 2024 to over 620 BTC by April 2025. The increase was achieved via equity placements and Bitcoin-denominated convertible bonds. TBG’s strategy has attracted support from well-known names in the crypto investment space, including Fulgur Ventures, UTXO Management, and TOBAM. Prominent cryptographer and Blockstream CEO Adam Back has also joined as a strategic advisor. Despite acknowledging the risks associated with the plan, the company maintains a clear goal: “accumulate as much BTC as possible, as fast as possible, in the most accretive way possible.” To fund this effort, TBG has projected a capital-raising potential ranging from €150 million to €100 billion over eight years, depending on market conditions and investor appetite. If the roadmap unfolds as planned, TBG could soon become Europe’s top corporate holder of Bitcoin. Share Price Soars in Six Months Since adopting its Bitcoin-focused model, TBG’s stock performance has mirrored other successful Bitcoin treasury firms. Its share price surged by 120% within the first month, 265% by the third month, and 474% after six months. This trend draws strong parallels to the early growth patterns of companies like Strategy and Metaplanet, both of which committed to the Bitcoin treasury model before TBG. “Bitcoin treasury companies are the fastest-growing companies in Europe,” TBG stated. Currently, Strategy remains the leading publicly listed corporate Bitcoin holder with 553,555 BTC—around 2.6% of the global circulating supply.",Bitcoin|Crypto News Today|Crypto Intelligence,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|BUSINESS|REGULATION|TRADING,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2025-05-02 05:21:12

FTM) Price Gearing Up—Will S (FTM) Price Reach $5 in 2025? appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News The Sonic price has triggered a strong upswing after trending lower for a couple of months and breaking out of its long-standing downtrend. The price is currently trading around $0.5595, with a massive rise of over 12% since the early trading hours, after stabilizing at a similar level during the past trading hours. The Sonic breakout was materialized after the star token, Bitcoin, displayed some strength and showed early signs of recovery. Now that the sentiments of the small-cap altcoins seem to have lifted, will the Sonic (prev. FTM) price reach $5 in 2025? The Sonic price is hovering just above its breakout zone, which has made the market participants extremely vigilant. A drop below the range may affect the bullish possibility for some time, but the chart patterns and the technicals suggest a strong rise could follow after a tight consolidation. The S price has reclaimed strength after testing support at $0.56 and is now trying to push back toward the $0.6 breakout zone. The daily chart of Sonic suggests there is a significant shift in the momentum where the bulls are trying to become dominant. The price is printing higher highs and lows, validating the rise if bullish strength. Meanwhile, the volume also appears to be in their favor, suggesting the price could remain elevated for the next few days. However, the technicals flash mixed signals, which raises concerns over the upcoming price action. The RSI is incremental, holding the ascending trend line, while the CMF has plunged heavily below 0 and is failing to rise above the descending trend line. This is a sign of weakness within the market, wherein the bears maintain their dominance. Meanwhile, the price continues to trade within an ascending triangle, and if it validates a rejection, a drop close to $0.5 could be imminent. However, the Sonic price is close to the apex of the triangle, and hence, a breakout from the pattern appears to be on the horizon. Therefore, the Sonic (prev. FTM) price may maintain a consolidated upswing and reach the edge at around $0.58. A rise above the range may push the levels above $0.6, which may attract some correction. Once done, the price could revive a strong upswing close to $0.8, which may further push the price into the final resistance below $1 at around $0.9. Surpassing these levels may attract fresh liquidity onto the platform and a rise may elevate the possibility of a new ATH.",Price Analysis|Altcoins,EN,0,0,ALTCOIN|BTC|FTM|MARKET|TRADING,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-05-02 05:24:29

The company just surpassed Wall Street estimates of $159.79 million by 1%. Riot’s Q1 revenue was a 50% jump compared to the same quarter a year ago. Riot blames “halving event” for expenses The firm reported a net loss of $296,367 over Q1, a 240% decrease from the $211,777 net income it posted in the year-ago quarter. Riot said that the average cost to mine Bitcoin ( BTC ) over the quarter was $43,808, almost 90% more than the $23,034 it cost to mine Bitcoin in the same period last year. “The increase was primarily driven by the block subsidy ‘halving’ event, which occurred in April 2024, and a 41% increase in the average global network hashrate as compared to the same period in 2024,” Riot said. Shares in Riot Platforms (RIOT) closed May 1 trading up 7.32%, trading at $7.77, according to Google Finance. Riot Platforms is down 13.47% over the past six months. Source: Google Finance Meanwhile, Riot produced 166 more Bitcoin during the quarter than it did over the same period in 2024.

The first, Ethereum R1, is a new tokenless layer-2 rollup designed to maintain decentralization and resist centralized control. The second initiative introduces ERC-7828 and ERC-7930 — two proposed token standards to standardize how blockchain addresses are displayed and interpreted across different chains. Ethereum Developers Launch R1 Rollup to Challenge L2 Status Quo Amid Fee Collapse and Governance Concerns An independent group of Ethereum developers has launched Ethereum R1, a tokenless layer-2 solution designed to preserve Ethereum’s core values of decentralization and neutrality — reigniting debate over the role and direction of Ethereum’s scaling ecosystem. A coalition of developers operating outside the Ethereum Foundation unveiled Ethereum R1 on May 1, positioning it as a “credible neutral” layer-2 (L2) rollup that rejects the trends of venture funding, token-driven incentives, and centralized governance that have become increasingly prevalent among L2 solutions. The initiative arrives at a critical juncture for Ethereum, where base layer revenues are collapsing, L2 networks are proliferating, and concerns are mounting over whether Ethereum's scaling roadmap is veering away from its original ethos. “General-purpose L2s should be commodities — simple, replaceable, and free from centralized dependencies or risky governance,” the team declared in an X post announcing the rollup. “Ethereum R1 is our answer to that call — the rollup grounded in credible neutrality, decentralization, and censorship resistance.” A Tokenless Alternative in a Token-Fueled Ecosystem What sets Ethereum R1 apart from other L2s is its uncompromising design philosophy. The developers behind the project have emphasized that R1 will not include a native token, will not accept venture capital, and will rely entirely on community donations to sustain itself. It also forgoes any form of governance token, an increasingly common element of L2 ecosystems that critics say concentrates decision-making power and financial incentives in the hands of a few stakeholders. This approach stands in sharp contrast to many of today’s L2s, such as Optimism and Arbitrum, which launched with sizable airdrops, foundation allocations, and VC participation. Critics argue that these tokenomics often skew incentives, creating L2s that behave more like standalone L1 blockchains rather than Ethereum-native scaling solutions. “Most L2s today are acting more like new L1s than an Ethereum scaling solution — private allocations, opaque governance, and centralized control,” the Ethereum R1 team wrote. Ethereum R1’s launch follows the Dencun upgrade in March 2024, which drastically lowered transaction fees across the Ethereum L2 landscape by introducing “blobspace” — a new data storage layer for rollups. While this achievement was hailed as a major step forward in improving user affordability and scaling potential, it came at a heavy cost to Ethereum’s base layer. According to data from Token Terminal, Ethereum’s base layer revenue collapsed by 99% by the end of Q1 2025, as most transactional activity migrated to cheaper L2s. In April 2025, average transaction fees on Ethereum fell to a five-year low of $0.16, sparking debates within the community about whether the base layer was being hollowed out in service of L2 expansion. Ethereum’s base layer revenue collapsed in Q1 2025 (Source: Token Terminal ) This has led to a paradox: while Ethereum is scaling efficiently through L2s, the financial sustainability of its L1 infrastructure is increasingly under scrutiny. Critics vs. Advocates: Is Ethereum Losing Its Base? The rise of token-centric L2s has also raised alarms over governance opacity, centralized sequencers, and economic extraction models that some view as antithetical to Ethereum’s founding principles. At the same time, proponents argue that Ethereum’s modular architecture — with L2s functioning as customizable execution environments — offers unparalleled flexibility and scalability. Anurag Arjun, co-founder of Avail, which builds unified chain abstraction solutions, said that Ethereum’s L2-centric approach “gives users a virtually unlimited number of high-throughput chains to choose from”, unlike monolithic chains that must scale vertically. Still, Ethereum’s decentralized community is split on the issue. One side views the proliferation of L2s as a necessary and powerful feature of Ethereum’s modular design. The other sees a creeping fragmentation — with incentives pulling developers and users away from Ethereum’s neutral and secure base layer. Ethereum R1: A Throwback or the Future? The Ethereum R1 project seems to deliberately position itself as a counterculture movement within the Ethereum ecosystem. By rejecting tokens, venture capital, and governance centralization, it harks back to early Ethereum values — namely, neutrality, censorship resistance, and decentralization as first principles, not afterthoughts. It’s unclear whether R1 will gain wide traction without the powerful economic incentives that token launches often provide. But its emergence signals a growing unease within the Ethereum community, and a hunger for alternatives that put ideology before investment returns. Ethereum Developers Push New Token Standards to Fix Cross-Chain Chaos Meanwhile, in a bid to bring order to Ethereum’s often chaotic multi-chain environment, a team of developers within the Ethereum ecosystem is rolling out two new token standards — ERC-7930 and ERC-7828 — aimed at improving blockchain interoperability and simplifying user experiences across decentralized applications and wallets. Announced in a May 1 post by Ethereum development organization Wonderland, the proposed standards are designed to bridge the gap between human users and blockchain protocols, ensuring that addresses and transactions can be easily interpreted and executed regardless of the chain in use. “There’s no standard way for wallets, apps, or protocols to interpret or display this information,” Wonderland wrote. “The result? A messy, inconsistent experience that breaks cross-chain UX.” Addressing Ethereum’s Interoperability Headache At the core of the issue is Ethereum’s growing Layer-2 and multichain ecosystem. While users can interact with networks like Optimism, Arbitrum, Base, and others using the same Ethereum-compatible address, those addresses often behave differently depending on the underlying chain infrastructure — leading to confusion, transaction errors, and even lost funds. Developers have long sought a standardized solution. The proposed ERC-7930 and ERC-7828 aim to do just that by creating a dual-layer addressing system: ERC-7930 introduces a machine-friendly binary format to ensure that protocols can seamlessly interpret addresses across all Ethereum-based chains. ERC-7828, meanwhile, provides a human-readable version using the format address@chain to help users clearly understand which blockchain they’re interacting with before executing a transaction. Together, the standards are designed to reduce friction and errors in the rapidly expanding Ethereum ecosystem. “Something for People, Something for Bots” During a recent interoperability working group call hosted by the Ethereum Foundation, Teddy from Wonderland explained that ERC-7828 is intended for any interface that interacts with users, while ERC-7930 is optimized for backend protocols and APIs. This dual-standard system aims to prevent users from accidentally sending assets to the wrong blockchain. It would allow wallets to be blockchain-agnostic, with the input field automatically determining the intended network based on the address format — a major improvement over the current requirement to manually switch networks in wallet settings. Wonderland emphasized the urgency of community feedback in their announcement. With plans to finalize the ERCs within two weeks, the team is calling on developers and ecosystem participants to review the proposals on the ETH-Magicians forum. “We badly need feedback on the ETH-Magicians forum,” Teddy said during the working group call. The standards are being developed in close collaboration with other major DeFi players, including Optimism, Aztec, Connext, and Yearn, all of whom have an active interest in improving the interoperability and user-friendliness of Ethereum's DeFi stack. Why This Matters for the Ethereum Ecosystem With the rise of Ethereum L2 networks and appchains, the need for standardization is becoming increasingly critical. Each new rollup or chain fragmenting the ecosystem adds complexity for both users and developers. Without a unified way to format and display addresses across chains, the user experience suffers — potentially driving adoption toward simpler, more vertically integrated alternatives. Many chains, one address is the ideal, but not without risk. Without clarity, users may send tokens to the wrong destination, losing funds or facing complex recovery processes. By offering both clarity for users and precision for machines, ERC-7828 and ERC-7930 seek to resolve one of Ethereum’s most pressing UX challenges. If widely adopted, they could lay the foundation for a more cohesive multi-chain experience within Ethereum — one where cross-chain operations feel as seamless as using a single network. The introduction of ERC-7930 and ERC-7828 marks a major step toward resolving Ethereum's cross-chain fragmentation. With backing from respected DeFi organizations and a clear focus on both usability and interoperability, these standards could become a cornerstone of Ethereum's evolving architecture.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|BUSINESS|ETH|ARB,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-05-02 05:30:00

While Shiba Inu (SHIB) is seeing renewed interest from whales and Cardano (ADA) is testing the strength of its breakout, both projects still depend heavily on speculative movement and trading patterns. In contrast, Dragoin presale crypto is building traction from the ground up through user interaction. Its Telegram-based Tap Game removes entry barriers and directly links gameplay to token rewards, offering both utility and potential upside. With a 6,700% ROI projected from its stage 2 presale, Dragoin is quietly positioning itself as the best crypto for payments through real engagement and accessibility. Dragoin’s Telegram Game Simplifies Crypto Earnings Dragoin is breaking new ground by making crypto earning as simple as tapping a screen. Unlike many projects that require complicated apps or wallet setups, Dragoin’s Telegram-based Tap Game allows users to start earning $DDGN tokens instantly by bursting balls. As a result, this frictionless approach significantly lowers the barrier for entry, making it highly attractive to new users seeking both entertainment and financial opportunity. Currently, in stage 2 of its presale, Dragoin offers early participants a rare chance to buy at just $0.0000335 per token. With a projected launch price of $0.002, early buyers are looking at a potential ROI exceeding 6700% when Dragoin lists on public exchanges. Therefore, this steep upside, paired with simple daily gameplay, positions Dragoin as a strong candidate for rapid adoption among casual users and crypto enthusiasts alike. Furthermore, the project’s approach to accessibility could also cement its place as one of the best crypto for payments in the future. By focusing on usability and daily earning mechanics, Dragoin is building a vibrant, active community before even hitting major trading platforms. Consequently, as players continue to earn Tap Points through the game, their connection to the $DDGN ecosystem strengthens, creating natural buying and holding pressure ahead of launch. Ultimately, those seeking a high-reward opportunity backed by real community participation may find Dragoin’s presale one of the most promising early entry points available today. With growth fueled by gameplay, community referrals, and scarcity from burned unsold tokens, Dragoin is setting the stage for an explosive debut. Shiba Inu (SHIB) Whale Activity Surges 90% Shiba Inu (SHIB) whale activity has spiked by 90%, signaling renewed interest from large holders. On April 21, major SHIB transactions totaled nearly $7.75 million, echoing similar patterns from late 2024 when whale movements preceded sharp price increases. Despite this, SHIB’s price has remained relatively flat, weighed down by a 30% drop in active addresses. This indicates a decline in retail engagement and suggests hesitation among smaller investors, even as whales quietly continue to buy. Notably, over 100 trillion SHIB tokens have been moved off exchanges, a clear indication that some whales are shifting toward long-term holding strategies. At the same time, the token faces resistance around the $0.0000129 level, a key price ceiling that capped April’s previous rally. If volume picks up and retail activity returns, SHIB could be positioned for another upward move. Cardano (ADA) Price Breakout Faces Test Cardano (ADA) recently confirmed a breakout above the $0.6440 level, forming a bullish pattern that hints at a potential 27% rally. This movement followed a symmetrical triangle formation and was backed by rising trading volume, suggesting growing trader interest. However, large holders offloaded over 180 million ADA between April 13 and 18, raising concerns about whether the price can maintain upward momentum. While the MACD remains in positive territory at 0.0063, the narrowing gap with its signal line signals weakening strength. Additionally, the Bull Bear Power indicator shows fading buying pressure. To sustain the current breakout, Cardano needs consistent volume support and positive investor sentiment. If price consolidation follows without sharp sell-offs, ADA could continue climbing. On the other hand, more large-scale selling might limit short-term gains. The coming sessions are expected to reveal whether ADA can hold above its breakout point or retreat to previous support levels. Dragoin Stands Out as the Best Crypto Shiba Inu and Cardano continue to capture attention through large-holder activity and price patterns, but Dragoin offers a different kind of value. Its direct connection between gameplay and earnings builds a daily habit among users, not just speculative hope. By removing friction and rewarding participation, Dragoin is creating a network of engaged holders even before hitting major exchanges. For those evaluating early-stage projects based on real usage potential and long-term utility, Dragoin presents a strong case. As adoption grows through its Tap Game, it may prove to be more than just a short-term gain and instead the best crypto for payments going forward.

Last around $2.22, the XRP price is currently holding just above its 21 and 50DMAs, around 38% above its April lows around $1.60. That impressive recovery comes as the broader crypto and US stock markets rally on hopes that US President Donald Trump is softening on his trade war stance, which could help the economy dodge a near-term crisis. However, US economic is increasingly pointing towards an impending recession, suggesting this optimism might be unfounded. And the XRP price could also face headwinds in wake of Franklin Templeton’s ETF application hitting a worrying roadblock. The SEC just delayed the decision until June 17th, per a Wednesday filing, and ETF analysts believe no decision may actually arrive until October. BREAKING: SEC DELAYS DECISION ON FRANKLIN TEMPLETON’S SPOT XRP ETF — NEW DEADLINE JUNE 17 The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has officially pushed its decision on the Franklin Templeton XRP Spot ETF to June 17, 2025, per a new filing published today. The… pic.twitter.com/inWewJeQVB — Diana (@InvestWithD) April 29, 2025 The implication is that “ETF hype” may not be a major narrative for XRP until the final quarter of the year. And with macro conditions seemingly worsening, despite Trump backing off from his trade war, XRP’s rally is at risk of becoming unstuck. XRP Price Prediction – Where Next? Taking a look at the XRP chart, the cryptocurrency appears to be in the process of forming a bullish flag pattern over the past few months. The current fundamental backdrop suggests a major near-term breakout of this pattern, say, in May, is unlikely. If the rally does continue, it may struggle to get past $2.50 and the price could easily slip back to the lower bounds of its recent trend channel. A return to sub-$2.0 levels may be on the card in the coming months, before an eventual major breakout comes later in the year, in sync with the approval of spot XRP ETFs by the US SEC . A better crypto to buy now for near-term gains might be a promising new Solana project called Solely (SOLX) , which has caught the attention of the web3 community with its impressive presale that’s raked in over $32 million so far.

Solaxy is the first Layer-2 solution for the Solana blockchain, designed to address network congestion and enhance scalability. By processing transactions off-chain and using rollups, Solaxy ensures faster, cheaper transactions while maintaining Solana’s security. With its massive presale haul, a 125% APY staking program and a growing community of over 70,000 followers, Solaxy is gaining major traction. Its no surprise then that some analysts are predicting a 10x return by the end of 2025, driven by Solana’s surging DeFi activity and Solaxy’s innovative infrastructure. As Solana’s ecosystem expands, Solaxy’s utility and potential make it a top crypto investment now.

Yet, even as the downturn persists, many in the market can only wonder whether this is a push toward a potential bounce or, instead, an ongoing downturn where Ethereum settles into something like the price it hit in 2016. The price of Ether (ETH) just doesn’t seem to want to go any higher, and in the face of new low after new low, some can’t help but think that this is a new situation for Ethereum. $ETH closed its 5th red month in a row. It’s been rough — but not a knockout. Is this the quiet before a bounce… or the setup for more pain? Hard to say, but one thing’s clear: all eyes are on what ETH does next. pic.twitter.com/Ioz4nbGXpi — Kyledoops (@kyledoops) May 1, 2025 For those closely watching Ethereum’s market behavior, some indicators suggest this might not be the downward spiral it appears to be. Ethereum’s exchange supply ratio has recently plunged to levels not seen in weeks, suggesting that ETH is being withdrawn from exchanges at an alarming rate. So is this bad news for Ethereum? Not really, because what we want to see, as ETH holders and Ethereum fans, is ETH leaving exchanges. In fact, the entirety of the Ethereum network is becoming increasingly devoid of ETH. Ethereum’s exchange supply ratio just plunged to multi-week lows. When this happens: ETH leaves exchanges → selling pressure drops → supply tightens → price squeezes. Binance is the liquidity hub. This isn’t small talk — it’s signal. Keep an eye on $ETH flows. pic.twitter.com/D4U70iG4fj — Kyledoops (@kyledoops) May 1, 2025 Yet, quantifying these effects is difficult, and making accurate calls on Ethereum’s near-term price movements is even trickier, given several big-picture variables at play: – Regulatory clarity for the crypto sector is still a long way off. – Institutional interest and investment keeps rising. – The state of the overall economy—whether in crypto or fiat—matters a lot. Ethereum’s Exchange Supply Ratio and What It Could Mean for the Price In recent weeks, one of the most notable shifts in Ethereum’s market activity has been the dramatic decline in its supply-to-exchange ratio. This indicator measures the amount of ETH held on exchanges relative to the overall circulating supply. When the ratio drops, it means that fewer ETH tokens are available on exchanges to buy. Of course, this is a very simplistic explanation, but the idea here is that if you have fewer tokens available to buy, that’s good for the price because we know that buyers need to come in at this level to keep the price going up. In the past, when low levels of exchange supply ratio were seen on Ethereum, those conditions were followed by upward price movements. This current consolidation pattern we are in may very well set up for the next potential bounce to the upside. All the while, as more and more ETH gets removed from exchanges, the already reduced supply in the hands of traders and short-term speculators grows ever more worrisome for those looking to keep the price of ETH down. While this indicator is certainly bullish, it does not guarantee that immediate price action will occur. The markets are too volatile for that. They are influenced by all sorts of events and developments beyond just technical indicators. So, one needs to keep in mind the potential influence of broader market sentiment, regulatory developments, and just good old supply-and-demand appetite on the price of Ether. Ethereum Spot ETFs: Outflows and Inflows Reflect Market Sentiment Another important aspect for the immediate future of Ethereum lies in how well Ethereum spot ETFs perform. As of April 30, the total net amount flowing into Ethereum spot ETFs was nearly $2.36 million, but with a few more numbers, that might read as: Institutional interest in Ethereum has definitely cooled. Investors are probably reducing their exposure to Ethereum—if not outright selling—that might be due to concerns over recent Ethereum performance and precision or a lack of investor confidence in the overall cryptocurrency market. Yet, not every Ethereum ETF had outflows. Fidelity’s Ethereum ETF (FETH) was among the very few to manage net inflows during that stretch. Does this mean some institutional players are pulling back from crypto while others are still confident in Ethereum’s long-term prospects? Or is it the case that FETH’s net inflows are simply a sign of price weakness around which smart institutional money (aka, hedge funds) is maneuvering to set up what it hopes will be a buying opportunity? On April 30, Bitcoin spot ETFs saw a total net outflow of $56.23 million, with BlackRock’s IBIT being the only fund to record a net inflow. Ethereum spot ETFs had a total net outflow of $2.36 million, with only Fidelity’s FETH posting a net inflow. https://t.co/Hj2Gs49bWa — Wu Blockchain (@WuBlockchain) May 1, 2025 The Ethereum spot ETF market reflects the mixed sentiment and broader uncertainty of ETH’s short-term future. There is certainly still institutional support for ETH, but the lack of inflows that are rising to the level of significant has to raise, at the very least, some eyebrow among proponents of Ethereum as to what larger players are seeing that is making them hesitate in committing capital. Looking Ahead: A Period of Uncertainty with a Potential for Upside Ethereum’s five straight months of losses are definitely worrisome, but the clear decrease in its exchange supply ratio and the spot ETF situation (which is somewhat amazing) indicate that the present market milieu is not entirely gloomy. Definitely, the reduction in selling pressure and imminent supply-tightening could lead to a prospective price squeeze that might also work in Ethereum’s favor. This potential for a bounce will depend heavily on several external factors. Continued macroeconomic uncertainty, regulatory developments, and overall market sentiment are very important in determining whether Ethereum can regain its upward momentum. The question is: can Ethereum finally break its losing streak and surge higher, or will the broader market conditions keep it trapped in a downward spiral? For both traders and investors, the next few weeks are going to be very important for determining the fate of Ethereum. The ETH leave exchange trend we have seen recently is a positive sign; however, it still remains to be seen if this will be enough to counter the larger market headwinds we are facing. As we know, the crypto world is always stupidly volatile and absurdly uncertain, so any price predictions must be taken with a whole grain of salt.

After skimming perilously close to a low of $74,901, the token’s worth had not seen anything lower since 2025, it bounced back hard. A 14.7% surge in the asset’s price took it back up to more optimistic levels, and even a recent spate of negative Bitcoin news couldn’t keep the asset down. The rebound, which many are now calling a ”rally,” was sparked by something that is quite common in finance: the easing of concerns over macroeconomic conditions. Bitcoin Gained 14.7% in April $BTC climbed 14.7% in April, recovering from a sharp early-month decline that pushed the price to $74,901, the lowest level so far in 2025.

A whole set of important elements that could act as price movers one way or another are now at play. And from these, three distinct scenarios have emerged that could shape the next phase of Bitcoin’s market performance. In short, will it keep going up, or face a near-term correction? The answer depends on a variety of things, but mostly on macroeconomic conditions and on-chain metrics.

The rally has… pic.twitter.com/AlPFIjkjQx — CryptoRank.io (@CryptoRank_io) April 30, 2025 Three Scenarios for Bitcoin’s Next Rally As Bitcoin moves further into May, analysts are outlining three possible scenarios that could dictate its price action in the coming months. The first scenario is the most optimistic: a bull market. According to on-chain data, Bitcoin’s momentum is currently in what is termed the “start rally” zone, with a ratio of approximately 0.8, or 80%. Should the on-chain ratio break through 1.0 and hold above it, Bitcoin could experience a significant price increase, with targets reaching between $150,000 to $175,000. This would mirror previous cycles observed in 2017 and 2021, where Bitcoin experienced substantial rallies. In this scenario, the NUPL (Net Unrealized Profit/Loss) and MVRV (Market Value to Realized Value) metrics would likely show a new impulse, signaling a bullish continuation. The second, and more probable, scenario is consolidation. If the on-chain momentum remains in the 0.8 to 1.0 range, Bitcoin’s price could enter a wide trading corridor between $90,000 and $110,000. In this scenario, market participants would hold their positions but not significantly increase exposure, leading to a more stable, yet stagnant, market. While this would allow for some growth, it would not trigger a parabolic rise like the previous bull run scenarios. Finally, the worst-case scenario entertains the notion of a correction. Should Bitcoin’s on-chain ratio slip beneath 0.75, we could see the short-term holders take profits, thus pushing us down further into the $70K to $85K range (if we even hit that range). This is another unlikely occurrence given that we already had a pretty decent-sized correction earlier this year. Bitcoin is warming up: Three scenarios that could shape the next rally “As of today, the on-chain momentum is in the 'start' rally zone (Ratio ≈ 0.8 / 80%). Let's examine three scenarios for the next six months: 1.

The total net outflow of the Bitcoin spot ETFs on April 30 amounted to $56.23 million, which indicates a somewhat adverse shift in the institutional sentiment surrounding Bitcoin. Nevertheless, during this apparent downturn, one notable exception was BlackRock’s Bitcoin ETF, known as IBIT. IBIT was the only fund in the Bitcoin ETF universe that experienced any kind of net inflow during the observed period. On April 30, Bitcoin spot ETFs saw a total net outflow of $56.23 million, with BlackRock’s IBIT being the only fund to record a net inflow. Ethereum spot ETFs had a total net outflow of $2.36 million, with only Fidelity’s FETH posting a net inflow. https://t.co/Hj2Gs49bWa — Wu Blockchain (@WuBlockchain) May 1, 2025 The capital outflow from Bitcoin spot ETFs could have a variety of sources, including that of some investors taking profits after having built up positions in Bitcoin during its earlier price rallies. The very recent withdrawal may also be a reflection of the kind of investor caution you would expect to see ahead of an uncertain big economic or regulatory event. Bitcoin’s Resilience and Future Outlook Binary options trading is a unique and highly popular means of trading in the global financial markets. Unlike traditional options trading, which requires the trader to make complex calculations based on various parameters to determine the potential profitability of a trade, binary options trading requires very little understanding of the market or the forms of profit involved. In fact, the only condition necessary for a trader to successfully engage in binary options trading is the ability to correctly predict whether an option will end up “in the money” (profitable) or “out of the money” (not profitable) at the time of expiration. The larger market is still coping with the change in the economic tide, but the Bitcoin price it seems is signaling the next big bull run could well be underway. The trader and investment community will, of course, be watching not just the price of Bitcoin but the on-chain metrics, ETF movements, and the broader economic landscape for signs of the cryptocurrency’s next big price move. In any case, right now, several things Bitcoin could do in the next few months look very promising indeed. Disclosure: This is not trading or investment advice.

And despite the ECSO level of these projects, Virtuals has gained not only market cap but also a level of influence and mindshare within a rapidly expanding sector that is all taking to the air. Virtuals Ecosystem Surges Ahead Amid Growing Sector Interest As of May 1, 2025, the market cap of Virtual is a solid $1.94 billion, which is 18% up just in the last 24 hours. The growth of the ecosystem can be largely attributed to the surging demand for AI agents—intelligent digital entities that can interact with the blockchain and carry out various tasks. Virtuals is one of the best projects in space when it comes to AI agents. The token price of $VIRTUAL has experienced an outstanding upsurge, hitting $1.6601, which signals an exciting 23.8% increase within a single day. This rise is not a mere one-off occurrence; it follows a consistently strong showing from this token, which is now riding the wave of hinterland project development and sector-wide growth. Without a doubt, this strong figure places Virtuals among the leading players in the AI-agent space. One of the key reasons for Virtuals’ recent success is its continued dominance in the market and in the minds of consumers. Virtuals has claimed 19.9% of the total mindshare in the AI-agent sector, increasing by 1.33% in the last 24 hours. This reflects an almost daily increase in the interest and recognition of Virtuals’ ecosystem, as it has become almost daily fodder for conversation among developers, consumers, and investors who have decided to turn and take a closer look at the project and its almost daily progress. Microcaps Explode: Top Performers Lead the Charge The growth of virtuals is not happening in isolation. The broader AI-agent market is experiencing an explosive expansion of its own, with some microcap projects seeing amazing price movements in just the past 24 hours. Among the top gainers, MONK (@monk_agent) has seen an unbelievable 150.9% price increase, while MISATO (@Misato_virtuals) has been up by an impressive 76.2%. Other standouts include PTAI (@pilot3ai), which has shot up by 60.5%, and DORA (@xDora_ai), which saw an amazing 49.8% increase in value. All of this points to just how much interest there is right now in AI-powered virtual agents and the awesome potential of this game-changing sector. Virtuals Daily Update | May 1st 2025 Stay up to date on all developments from the @virtuals_io ecosystem over the last 24 hours… pic.twitter.com/fpDzv80OnG — Graeme (@gkisokay) May 1, 2025 Even with the astronomical growth of these smaller projects, Virtuals keeps a dominant role and presence in the ecosystem. Its continued strength in price action, liquidity, and mindshare has virtually ensured it leads the league in AI-agent adoption. With a seemingly nonstop focus on developing an ecosystem that features community-driven elements, top-notch partnerships, and cutting-edge tech, however, Virtuals appears to be taking a well-placed lead in this unfolding narrative of AI agents. A sign of the increasingly diverse world of the AI-agent sector is the fast ascent of microcap projects. While new players are always entering the fray, competition is sure to become more intense. With its early dominance, however, Virtuals is better positioned to solidify a foothold in this space. Looking Ahead: Virtuals Set to Dominate the AI-Agent Landscape The AI-agent market is ever expanding, and now all eyes are on Virtuals. It is steadily asserting itself as one of the key players in the space. With a growing market cap, a significant amount of mindshare, and a price of $VIRTUAL that is moving in the right direction, the project looks well-positioned to continue being part of the AI-agent conversation in the months ahead. The current market trend indicates that AI-driven projects will continue to be a major point of interest in the blockchain and crypto sectors. As this space develops further, and as new applications of AI in crypto are found, Virtuals’ capability to both keep up with and push to the front of such innovations will directly impact its standing as a provably major player in web3. Currently, both investors and enthusiasts are watching closely and with optimism the ongoing growth of Virtuals. They seem destined to enjoy the same good fortune that has already befallen the likes of ChatGPT, DALL-E, and other generative AIs. With solid fundamentals and a crystal-clear marketing strategy, Virtuals appears also to be our next bet on an AI agent that really might not only work but also be widely used across the industry at large.

In a May 1 blog post , the Sui Foundation announced that it will integrate sBTC and support the Stacks ( STX ) network, expanding its Bitcoin ( BTC ) DeFi capabilities. sBTC is a Bitcoin-backed asset developed by Stacks, a Bitcoin layer-2, and allows users to use their BTC in DeFi without relying on centralized custodians. As part of the integration, Sui ( SUI ) will also operate a validator on the Stacks network. The goal is to unlock DeFi opportunities like lending, borrowing, and trading for BTC holders, on a high-performance chain built for scale. “For too long, BTC has been treated as a passive asset. sBTC on Sui means holders can earn yield, participate in DeFi, and stay true to Bitcoin’s trustless ethos—all on Sui, a blockchain built for performance and scale.” — Adeniyi Abiodun, Mysten Labs co-founder With more than $6.5 billion currently locked in Bitcoin DeFi protocols, demand for BTCfi is rapidly increasing. Sui offers a scalable execution layer, while sBTC offers a decentralized method of meeting this demand. Its object-based architecture and parallel transaction processing make it an attractive platform for building DeFi apps.

Data from the last week indicate that well over 80,000 individual traders have made their way back to the platform, making this the highest level of activity seen since at least April. This resurgence not only seems to be propelling OpenSea back into the territory of user favor but also appears to be hinting at a more general return of NFT enthusiasm, particularly across several layer-2 ecosystems. @opensea is having a strong week, with over 82K traders in the past 7 days. Recent spikes on @arbitrum , @base , and @blast are driving momentum – showing where NFT interest is heating up.

One of the primary catalysts behind this uptick is surging activity across several Ethereum layer-2 networks, particularly Arbitrum, Base, and Blast. These chains have become fertile ground for NFT experimentation due to their lower gas costs and fast transaction speeds—boosting trading, minting, and gaming applications to an almost ideal platform level. OpenSea’s renewed focus on attempting to expand its presence across these ecosystems seems to be paying dividends. Arbitrum and Base have both seen exhibition increases in NFT volume and community engagement, as new collections and incentivized drops attract waves of fresh participants. Meanwhile, Blast—an emerging player in the L2 space—is quickly gaining traction, aided by its native rewards system and tight integration with NFT applications. The result is a significant migration of traders back to OpenSea, where these assets are increasingly being listed and flipped. For a significant part of the NFT community, the relationship between OpenSea and the rapidly expanding L2s of Ethereum is, more than anything, a relationship of convenience. The trading experience in these environments is more efficient, far less accessible than at some not-too-distant points in Ethereum’s past, and—as a delightful side effect—much less expensive than what trading on Ethereum mainnet costs at present or even at any time over the last year. OS 2.0 Beta and SEA Token Hype Add to the Surge Despite being a main layer driving activity, the beta launch of OpenSea 2.0 is actually the chief instigator of the latest uptick in user engagement. This long-awaited revamp offers a remodeled look, a speedier trading engine, and better analytics. Oh, and it also promises users on-chain rewards. All in all, it should help restore OpenSea’s dominance as the layer-2 landscape lavishes it with attention. Individuals taking part in the OS 2.0 beta are presently raking in rewards, with a number of SB users now doing so for the better part of a couple of months. And why, you might ask? Because we hear concerns from OpenSea that users might lose out on potential future Sea Token airdrops if they aren’t using the platform. And in quite the eerie coincidence, SB users have also heard from OpenSea in DMs recently, inviting them to partake in a user behavior study. Why not use the platform “as much as possible, for as many different types of things as you can,” we were told. In a nutshell, take OpenSea’s concerns as an incentive to keep using the platform and possibly grab a few future rewards in the process. These mechanics are a direct reflection of the way taken by other prosperous Web3 platforms that have capitalized on airdrop speculation and reward farming to ignite activity and loyalty. With each passing day, as more users rush to test OS 2.0 and push their on-chain interactions to the limit, OpenSea seems to be getting the windfall that comes from a virtuous cycle of usage and visibility. A Return to Relevance in the Evolving NFT Landscape Throughout a large part of 2023 and early 2024, OpenSea has suffered not only a declining market share but also the growth of a narrative that it has so far been too slow to innovate. This is despite the fact that, in some areas, OpenSea used to be the market leader (and still is, in number of users and volume, if not in reputation). Meanwhile, aggressive incentives from competitors like Blur have diverted some trading activity. Currently, the OS 2.0 beta is out, and there is strong engagement from users across the various L2 blockchains. This is a good sign, and it shows that OpenSea has found its footing again—at least for now. The big question remains, though: How sustainable is this momentum? Can OpenSea continue to support emerging artists, as it promises to do, and is it really going to unleash a SEA token that (in my mind) needs to be a game-changer for it to be worthwhile? What is now clear is that OpenSea is no longer sitting still in the background; it is reestablishing itself as a main player in the NFT ecosystem, propelled by an exciting new direction and a vibrant, growing user base.

While the administration’s approach has so far been more cautious than some of Trump’s campaign rhetoric promised, several meaningful steps suggest a more crypto-friendly federal landscape. From symbolic actions to institutional groundwork, the early days of Trump’s crypto policy are already reshaping expectations for how digital finance might evolve under his leadership. A Pro-Crypto Cabinet and a Symbolic National Reserve One of the most remarkable actions happened early in Trump’s presidency when he appointed a number of pro-crypto individuals to top regulatory and advisory roles. With this move, the administration is clearly trying to instill a foundation of sorts—logic would have it either for a basis to operate on or to point to with pride in the imminent future—for not-so-hostile frameworks and policies around digital assets. At a minimum, this effect could give some agencies, like the SEC, the courage to work with the industry instead of just shoving them under the bus. The appointments happened across all the relevant agencies, so it can’t be written off as a crypto-friendly faction in just one agency. Here’s a quick rundown of the appointments. In another headline-making turn of events, the Trump administration declared that it was setting up a national crypto reserve. The idea of a federal reserve of digital assets isn’t entirely new but had never before received the official imprimatur of the White House. A crypto reserve, as proposed, would put the United States in a world where sovereign states are increasingly engaging with digital currencies, both as an economic asset and a geopolitical tool. Nevertheless, Trump fell short of some of the more aggressive measures that crypto advocates hoped for. For one, there are no plans as of yet to direct any taxpayer dollars into what are essentially private investment vehicles. Working through new partnerships with the private sector, the reserve will instead utilize alternative mechanisms. In an administration that has thus far sought to downplay its investment in Bitcoin and other major cryptocurrencies, this is as much a signal of intent as anything else. And certainly, it’s a way of building credibility and, hopefully, avoiding controversy. Key Crypto Milestones from Trump’s First 100 Days Trump’s first 100 days in office have been eventful for the crypto industry. Staying true to his campaign promises, he has taken notable steps in support of crypto, including appointing pro-crypto leaders to key federal agencies,… pic.twitter.com/VyOB87Z5XQ — CryptoRank.io (@CryptoRank_io) April 30, 2025 White House Crypto Summit Marks a Cultural Shift Maybe the most symbolic gesture thus far is hosting the inaugural White House Crypto Summit. The event brought together key figures from the blockchain industry and federal agencies to discuss the future of decentralized technologies in the U.S. economy. The summit did not yield any immediate policy declarations; however, it was marked by an unprecedented level of engagement between the federal government and the crypto sector. The summit underscored many of the themes that have long resonated in and been championed by the crypto community, including responsible innovation and the need for modernized regulation in order to maintain the United States’ edge in global competitiveness. It also served as a direct way for industry stakeholders to express their top concerns to those in charge of the relevant federal agencies. For many, this event felt like a watershed moment, cementing the serious and sober national interest in the topic of digital assets. Market Reaction: Bitcoin Outperforms Amid Equity Volatility The crypto market has reacted favorably, even if the administration has adopted a cautious tone. Bitcoin, especially, has shown some real resilience to and upward momentum, even as the traditional markets have started to wobble under the weight of President Trump’s aggressive tariff policies. The contrast between a digital asset market that seems to be strengthening and an equities market that seems to be correcting has done nothing to dull investor interest in Bitcoin as a hedge against broader uncertainty in the economy. Although many in the cryptocurrency sector had hoped for more daring regulatory reforms or direct government investment in digital assets, the market seems to appreciate Trump’s early moves for the symbolism and direction they provide. This cautious optimism has helped maintain a bullish sentiment, especially among institutional investors who prize the kind of policy stability and regulatory clarity that seem to have been ushered in by the Trump administration. With Trump having moved beyond his first 100 days, sharp focus is now cast on just how these early foundations will be built upon. Will the administration back its symbolic gestures with truly substantive policy? And will regulatory clarity improve under the supposed guidance of pro-crypto appointees? These are the questions, kids, that will go a long way toward shaping the crypto market’s trajectory for the rest of Trump’s term. Disclosure: This is not trading or investment advice.

However, all eyes are now on the looming psychological barrier at $100K, a critical level that could either trigger profit-taking or act as a springboard toward new all-time highs. Technical Analysis By ShayanMarkets The Daily Chart BTC’s recent breakout above the decisive $95K resistance marks a key technical and psychological victory for the bulls. Following a brief consolidation period around this level, renewed buying pressure drove the price firmly higher, signaling the continuation of the bullish trend that began after the correction phase earlier this year. This breakout is a notable bullish development, as the $95K level had previously capped Bitcoin’s advances and aligned with prior swing highs. However, the focus now shifts to the $100K resistance zone, a round number that historically carries significant psychological weight. It is likely to be filled with latent sell orders, take-profit triggers, and institutional distribution, all of which could temporarily stall or reverse upward momentum. If bulls manage to breach this psychological barrier decisively, it would likely result in a strong continuation rally, with the next logical target being Bitcoin’s all-time high at $109K. The 4-Hour Chart On the 4-hour timeframe, Bitcoin initially paused at the $95K resistance, forming a sideways consolidation structure indicative of supply absorption. However, this consolidation was short-lived, as new demand flooded the market, resulting in a clean breakout above $95K, confirming buyers’ dominance and the validity of the prior breakout. Despite the strength of this move, the $100K mark now stands as the next major challenge. This level not only aligns with psychological resistance but also coincides with a prior major swing high, increasing its technical relevance. Should BTC fail to overcome $100K on its first attempt, profit-taking and smart money distribution could trigger a rejection and a corrective pullback toward the $90K support zone, where the 100 and 200-day moving averages currently provide structural reinforcement. Alternatively, the more probable short-term scenario is a consolidation phase below $100K, allowing the market to accumulate momentum before a potential breakout toward the $109K ATH. On-chain Analysis By Shayan The Taker Buy/Sell Ratio is a key on-chain metric that measures the ratio of market buy orders to market sell orders on exchanges such as Binance. In the latest reading, the Taker Buy/Sell Ratio has spiked sharply, reaching the highest level observed within the recent months. This surge suggests that market participants are increasingly executing market buy orders, reflecting a shift from passive accumulation to aggressive entry at market prices. Such behaviour typically occurs when investors and traders are confident in an imminent price increase or fear missing out on a rally, classic signs of strong bullish sentiment. The spike on the ratio chart highlights an influx of taker buy volume, confirming that buyers are actively chasing price, rather than waiting for lower entries. This behavioural shift often precedes strong upward momentum in price action, especially when coupled with rising open interest and positive price structure.

Several crypto projects are scheduled to unlock new tokens worth in excess of $4.59 billion—across the board, this is a pretty good number. But in this case, there’s one standout event, which is that WhiteBIT Coin ($WBT) is unlocking a staggering 1.15 billion tokens. This is by far the biggest single event in May in terms of supply change. And with unlocking new supply of this magnitude, naturally, our attention turns to what impact it might have on price, sentiment, and liquidity. WhiteBIT Coin Leads the Emissions Chart This month’s main unlock concerns $WBT, the native token of the prominent centralized exchange WhiteBIT. A total of 39.5 million $WBT tokens, worth around $1.15 billion, are being released into the market. This huge influx comes from WhiteBIT Funds 2, a multi-purpose allocation that serves several strategic functions nestled within the WhiteBIT ecosystem. May 2025 Supply Release: $4.59 Billion in New Token Supply This month, over $4.5B in new supply enters the market led by a notable unlock from $WBT (WhiteBIT Coin) 39.5M $WBT will be released, valued at ~$1.15B This release comes from WhiteBIT Funds 2 a multi-purpose… pic.twitter.com/EHJY0jLxLR — Tokenomist (prev. TokenUnlocks) (@Tokenomist_ai) April 30, 2025 As per WhiteBIT, the fresh tokens will serve multiple purposes: enhancing the liquidity of the platform; strengthening treasury reserves; boosting platform ecosystem growth; providing user incentives; rewarding team members; and increasing platform security. WhiteBIT is not alone in this approach, but it serves as a prime example of a crypto platform undertaking a token distribution exercise. WhiteBIT has diversified the allocation of these tokens, and while it is impossible to determine the direct effect of this on the market, it is part of a long-term user engagement strategy. Even with stated intentions, such a large token release is bound to cause unrest. Historically, when this many tokens have been unlocked, the selling pressure has ramped up. And if most of these tokens land in the hands of secondary-market traders, that pressure will almost certainly escalate. Of course, the big question is: How many tokens will the wallets associated with the exchange and the on-chain activity of the exchange itself be responsible for? And what’s going to happen to them? Market Implications and Trader Sentiment The May unlocks are particularly significant because of the scale and the timing. They coincide with a not very stable market. The crypto market seems to be recovering a little after a very turbulent first quarter, but we’ve seen in the past that the unlocking of large quantities of tokens can push prices down. So, natural price finding mechanisms, right? If there’s not organic demand for a token, if it’s not a Bitcoin, Ethereum, or a stablecoin, then just the addition of $4.59 billion in circulating supply could present some headwinds. And even some of those names—like a Litecoin, for instance—right now, we’re looking at a situation where just the sheer introduction of that much supply could push prices down. Both retail and institutional traders are now paying closer attention to tokenomics. This is especially true when it comes to matters like emissions schedules and lock-up periods. Retail and institutional traders both are now paying closer attention to tokenomics. This is especially true when it comes to emissions schedules and lock-up periods. The fact that $WBT makes up such a large portion of this month’s total unlocks makes it a high-risk, short-term speculation opportunity. And yet, long-term holders can find some comfort in WhiteBIT’s positioning of the unlock as a strategic growth opportunity. Key in the coming weeks will be the interpretation by the market of WhiteBIT’s use of the released funds. If these tokens are deployed effectively to increase user acquisition, incentivize liquidity, and expand platform features, the long-term benefit could outweigh the short-term dilution concerns. Conversely, if large amounts are sold into the market or moved to exchanges, $WBT could experience notable downward pressure. A Broader Look at Token Supply Trends Although this month’s headlines are dominated by WBT, it is only one of many tokens that are part of May’s total emission of $4.59 billion. Scheduled unlocks across the crypto sector are becoming much more of a talking point; much more a closely scrutinized feature of the tokens that trade in the crypto culture. What this means is that we can now much more easily see what risks are being taken on scheduled unlocks across the crypto sector. And if we can see it, then traders, analysts, and the communities part of the various protocols can see it too. May’s figure counts among the highest monthly totals recently seen. It comes as a critical moment for the market. More and more projects are nearing the end of their vesting schedule and are unlocking long-held reserves. Projects of this sort are introducing a good number of tokens to the market. Supply and demand are becoming much more vital to watch. Currently, the most significant event is the unlocking of WhiteBIT Coin, which is worth $1.15 billion. This situation offers us a chance to gauge how the market might respond to a huge emission of tokens in a somewhat maturing crypto sphere. In my mind, this makes WhiteBIT Coin somewhat of a test case. Disclosure: This is not trading or investment advice.

The acquisition also happened as Kraken gears up for an initial public offering in early 2026 and is exploring a debt package of between $200 million and $1 billion to support the move. In crypto, an Initial Public Offering (IPO) refers to when a crypto company—like an exchange or blockchain firm—lists its shares on a traditional stock exchange for the first time to raise capital from public investors. It's the same process used by companies in other industries, and it allows broader market participation in the company’s equity. In the same report, Kraken revealed that its first quarter revenue rose 19% year-on-year to $471.7 million. However, that figure still represented a 6.8% decline from the previous quarter, with trading volume dropping 9.6% to $208.7 billion and custodied assets falling 18% to $34.9 billion. (Source: Kraken Q1 financial update ) Kraken attributed the decline in activity to a broader market slowdown that was triggered by US President Donald Trump’s tariff threats, which contributed to an 18% decrease in total crypto market capitalization during the quarter. The firm also pointed out that Q4 2024 saw near-record activity levels, boosted by the volatility after Trump’s election win in November. Despite the softer market conditions, Kraken reported a 1% rise in adjusted EBITDA to $187.4 million and a 10% increase in funded accounts, reaching 3.9 million. The company also underwent a major internal restructuring under co-CEO Arjun Sethi, who was appointed in October and has since laid off around 400 employees. Tether Posts Over $1B Profit Other crypto firms also recently shared their Q1 performances. Tether, the issuer of the world’s largest stablecoin, reported over $1 billion in operating profit for the first quarter of 2025, along with nearly $120 billion in exposure to US Treasurys. Tether’s Q1 financial report The company disclosed holding $98.5 billion in direct US Treasury bills and an additional $23 billion through repurchase agreements and other cash-equivalent instruments. These holdings underpin the company’s USDT stablecoin, which now has a market cap of close to $149 billion. USDT’s all-time market cap (Source: CoinMarketCap ) Despite the strong financials, Tether’s excess reserves for USDT declined to $5.6 billion from $7.1 billion at the end of 2024. Still, the company said that it continues to leverage its surplus capital to fund strategic investments across sectors like renewable energy, artificial intelligence, peer-to-peer communications, and data infrastructure. During the first quarter, USDT’s circulating supply grew by approximately $7 billion, while the number of user wallets increased by 46 million. This signals that there is still strong demand for the stablecoin. Tether’s dominant position in the stablecoin market, alongside Circle’s USDC, gives the two issuers a combined 87% market share of dollar-pegged tokens. The US Treasury projected that the overall market cap for dollar-backed stablecoins could hit $2 trillion by 2028. However, European officials raised red flags over this growing reliance on dollar-based tokens, as they believe it poses potential systemic risks. The Bank of Italy warned that disruptions in stablecoin markets or their underlying bond holdings could reverberate across the global financial system. Saylor’s Strategy Misses Earnings Estimates Michael Saylor’s Bitcoin-focused firm Strategy, formerly known as MicroStrategy, reported a year-to-date yield of 13.7% on its Bitcoin holdings. This translates to an unofficial gain of over 61,000 BTC worth approximately $5.8 billion. In its May 1 earnings release, Strategy called these figures internal benchmarks for measuring the success of its Bitcoin investment strategy. The firm’s chief financial officer, Andrew Kang, stated that it now aims for a 25% Bitcoin yield and a total gain of $15 billion by the end of the year. Highlights from Stategy’s Q1 financial results Despite strong performance in its Bitcoin portfolio, Strategy missed Wall Street’s expectations for the first quarter. The company posted $111.1 million in revenue, which is down 3.6% from the same period last year and around 5% below analyst forecasts. It also reported a big net loss of $4.2 billion, or $16.49 per diluted share, far exceeding the projected 11 cents per share loss. The loss was largely attributed to a $5.9 billion unrealized loss on its Bitcoin holdings, which caused total operating expenses to surge by close to 2,000% to $6 billion. To fund future Bitcoin acquisitions, Strategy announced plans to offer up to $21 billion in additional stock. The firm’s aggressive Bitcoin strategy continues, with over 550,000 BTC acquired since 2020 at an average price of $68,500 per coin, totaling nearly $38 billion in costs. On May 1, the value of its Bitcoin treasury grew to more than $53 billion. Shares in Strategy (MSTR) ended May 1 up 0.39% at $381.60, though they dipped slightly in after-hours trading. The stock is up more than 31.5% year-to-date but is still way below its November 2024 high of over $470. Strategy stock price over the past 24 hours (Source: Google Finance ) Strategy is still the largest corporate holder of Bitcoin, contributing to the total of over $73 billion held by public companies. Combined with Bitcoin funds and institutional investors, more than $200 billion worth of Bitcoin is now in the hands of major financial players. Some industry observers warn that continued institutional accumulation, led by firms like Strategy, could eventually crowd out retail investors from the market.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|EXCHANGE|MARKET|USDT,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-05-02 05:53:35

Here’s why,https://timestabloid.com/analyst-calls-30-xrp-price-crash-heres-why/,"XRP has come under renewed pressure amid a broader market downturn that has affected several top cryptocurrencies. After a recent rally, Bitcoin pulled back, falling below $95,000. This slump has triggered bearish momentum across the board, and despite excitement for potential XRP ETF approval , the digital asset was not spared. Within the past few days, XRP saw its value decline significantly after hitting an intra-week high of $2.36. The asset dropped nearly 8% from that peak, and as of now, it has erased much of the prior week’s rally and is trading at $2.2, down 1.6% over the past 24 hours. Short-Term Support Level Remains Intact Despite the pullback, some analysts believe XRP still retains key technical support. In a recent update, market observer BitGuru (@bitgu_ru) noted that the token holds above a crucial consolidation range on the 1-hour chart. $XRP just faced a sharp drop from $2.3094 to $2.1543 after failing to hold above the recent consolidation range. Despite the sell-off, the price is still above the major support zone, and a bounce-back toward $2.25 or higher #XRP #TradingView pic.twitter.com/l73J2RU9Fi — BitGuru (@bitgu_ru) April 30, 2025 We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Despite the drop, the digital asset has held its position above the support level at $2.15. BitGuru suggested that continued strength above this support level could open the door for a short-term rebound. He outlined the potential for a recovery toward $2.25, with further upside possible if bullish momentum resumes. Some projections have even pointed to a scenario in which XRP revisits its all-time highs, possibly climbing to the $10-$20 range soon , though such targets remain speculative. Analyst Predicts XRP Decline Not all analysts share that optimism. In contrast, BLOCK BULL (@TheBlockBull), a well-known market analyst, recently issued a bearish forecast for XRP. He shared a technical breakdown on X, suggesting the asset will experience a 30% correction. His analysis points to a failed breakout attempt from the upper end of a bull flag pattern on the daily chart. According to BLOCK BULL, XRP’s rejection from that resistance zone has already triggered a downturn, and further weakness could bring the price as low as $1.55. He identified $1.55 as the bottom of the flag structure, positioning it as a potential target during a continued downturn. However, the projected dip could present a strategic opportunity for accumulation . The analyst indicated that large investors may use this type of price movement to enter at a discount, suggesting that although retail investors may find it difficult, long-term holders should maintain their positions.

44055125,https://nulltx.com/?p=148697,1746165294,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/nulltx.png,Spike in Whale Transfers Signals Potential Reversals for Top Cryptocurrencies,https://nulltx.com/spike-in-whale-transfers-signals-potential-reversals-for-top-cryptocurrencies/,"Beneath the surface, blockchain analytics platforms have seen a striking rise in whale activity across a number of large cryptocurrencies. This has given some pause to consider what it might mean for us common folk trading these crypto assets. Whales are powerful entities. They can make or break a market, as they say, by their sheer presence. And in the last week, the 10 cryptocurrencies with the largest percentage increases in transfers to and from entities holding over a million units were not top-tier assets by any means. Transfers carried out by whales—typically defined as on-chain transactions involving very large sums of a given asset—can often serve as early signals of market movements. In this context, an on-chain transaction is one that has been recorded on the blockchain, the digital ledger in which all transactions involving a particular cryptocurrency are kept. Accumulation of a cryptocurrency, offloading it ahead of market events, and shifting internal ecosystem assets are three large-scale activities that can and do move the prices of cryptocurrency assets. Volatility, trend reversals, and sharp rallies are three types of price movements that traders typically pay attention to. This week’s top movers include KCS, USDC (Avalanche), sENA, and WBTC (Optimism), with other notables in the bunch being UNI, USDT (Avalanche), OP, WLD (Optimism), CRV (Arbitrum), and FLOKI. This week, several cryptocurrencies have seen significant rises in whale transfers. These are the top 10, according to percentage increases among $500M+ marketcaps. 1) @kucoin $KCS 2) @circle $USDC (On Avalanche) 3) @ethena_labs $sENA 4) @wrappedbtc $WBTC (On… pic.twitter.com/qfuGvOPmYA — Santiment (@santimentfeed) April 30, 2025 Non-Stablecoin Assets Draw the Spotlight Amid Whale Surge At the head of the list is KCS, the native token of KuCoin. It experienced the highest percentage increase in whale transfers among the tracked group. The KuCoin exchange has seen a recent uptick in both user engagement and scrutiny, which could mean that its internal wallet movements or outflows to institutions are part of some recent token accumulation. These transfers don’t always mean there are buys or sells happening, but they do often come before a price move, which is something traders tend to watch. Avalanche has made the list with USDC as a synthetic dollar; the second synthetic dollar on this week’s list is sENA, a not-so-well-known synthetic dollar from Ethena Labs. Whale activity in stablecoins like USDC and USDT often reflects either capital rotation across chains or large entities preparing for trades. So, the presence of both USDC and USDT (also on Avalanche) in this week’s list could signify either a liquidity reshuffle in Avalanche or a prelude to an increase in DeFi activity on the chain. sENA’s presence is notable because of Ethena Labs’ increasing stature in the synthetic asset realm. Adoption of synthetic assets is on the rise, and large price movements in sENA—like those seen in the price of any cryptocurrency—could very well be the result of strategic hedging or some other form of institutional entry. Or, they could be a signal of something going on at the protocol level. None of that would necessarily be bad news if sENA is to fulfill its role as a synthetic stablecoin, let alone as one that can generate liquidity. And yet, sENA is increasingly a topic of conversation. Another asset drawing considerable interest is WBTC on Optimism. The on-chain dynamics of Wrapped Bitcoin tend to reflect the sentiment around using Bitcoin within cross-chain DeFi, as well as its use as collateral in the currently suboptimal DeFi landscape. When Wrapped Bitcoin and Optimism converge, it’s usually to great fanfare. Whale-sized transactions in WBTC could signal that an uptick in BTC participation across Optimism’s burgeoning native DeFi ecosystem is on the horizon. Among the tokens added to the list, the Uniswap token (UNI), the native OP token from Optimism, and the Worldcoin token (WLD)—which both operate on the layer-2 Optimism network—are some of the biggest. Whale transfers of these tokens may indicate upcoming governance decisions, asset unlocks, or speculative activity. Given the substantial network overlap these tokens have, it would appear that Optimism Capital is Concentrating this week. The CRV of Curve on Arbitrum is also very prominent. With CRV often serving as a token that incentivizes liquidity in DeFi protocols, large-scale movements could soon signal a major shift either in strategy (if the movement is toward better liquidity) or in market dynamics (if the movement is toward worse liquidity). Host to another rising whale, the meme coin turned utility project, FLOKI , rounds out the list. With movements in FLOKI seemingly also correlated to some upcoming announcements or just some good, ole hype cycles, sloshing around a still very liquid Ethereum could do any number of things in terms of price effects even if the liquid in question is not doing very much in the way of providing real economic value. For a long time, assets on comparable whale transfer lists—especially non-stablecoin assets—have shown a greater chance of short- to mid-term price reversals. But here’s the thing: this isn’t a guaranteed indicator. And the reason it isn’t shouldn’t really be surprising. After all, the price of an asset is influenced by a whole lot of (often unpredictable) factors. For traders and investors, this data represents a key opportunity to identify potential entry or exit points. While stablecoin movements typically suggest preparatory positioning, the behavior in volatile tokens like KCS, sENA, UNI, and CRV may offer more actionable signals, especially when paired with price momentum or technical indicators. These changes in whale behavior are likely to affect the broader trading story in the days ahead, and they could have an effect on volatility, which is already picking up in major markets.

As per a May 1 analysis by CryptoQuant contributor Maartun, the network currently handles approximately 8.4 million transactions every day. Although activity peaked during the 2021 and 2023 bull runs, TRON’s ( TRX ) daily usage has been increasing steadily. Maartun stressed that this level of on-chain traffic is often overlooked but remains a strong bullish signal. Milestone: TRON just crossed 10.0 B Total transactions! “Daily transaction count is around ~8.4 million. This is among the highest in the space.

According to DeFiLlama data , the network’s total value locked is currently sitting at $5.03 billion. Recent activity suggests a recovery trend, even though it is still less than the $7 billion recorded at the beginning of the year. Decentralized exchange volume, on the other hand, has reached its highest monthly level this year, rising from $3.4 billion in March to $4.9 billion in April. Additionally, TRON’s position in the stablecoin market keeps growing. The network’s stablecoin market capitalization has increased from $58 billion in Janyary to over $70 billion. In late April, there was a significant increase of $2.17 billion added in a single week. This included Tether ( USDT ) minting $1 billion USDT on Apr. 21.

44055193,https://nulltx.com/?p=148698,1746165427,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/nulltx.png,"Hyperliquid Overhauls Fee Structure and Staking Tiers, Signaling a Shift Toward Institutional Incentives",https://nulltx.com/hyperliquid-overhauls-fee-structure-and-staking-tiers-signaling-a-shift-toward-institutional-incentives/,"On May 3rd, Hyperliquid is set to make a big change in how it charges trading fees and in how it models staking. These changes, which are very likely to be observationally noticed by end users the moment they’re enacted, mark an overall shift in the way Hyperliquid looks and feels—and, in some ways, thinks. The protocol’s fee model is moving toward a tiered, incentive-based system that will, on first glance, offer more direct rewards for high-volume traders and for users with big stakes in the system. Look closer and it may seem, at least in some ways, a bit more expensive for end users who aren’t day trading or putting half their net worth into the system. The updates encompass a comprehensive revamp of both taker and maker fees, augmented trading volume thresholds for beneficial rates, and the incorporation of staking tiers associated with the platform’s native token, HYPE. Even though traders at the institutional level may forage for opportunities to clinch deeper discounts, the retail crowd and second-tier market makers will probably experience most of the injuries. The updates inflict the most damage on these two groups. New Fee Structure: Higher Costs, Higher Barriers Base trading fees will go up under the new system; these fees are for takers. They will rise from 3.5 basis points (bps) to 4.5 bps. Fee discounts will be based on two criteria: how much HYPE is staked and the user’s 14-day weighted trading volume. Despite these available reductions, most retail users will see cost increases right away. For the average trader, the increase in taker fees amounts to a 10% – 30% rise. The only users who are really benefitting from these available reductions are those staking very large amounts of HYPE—specifically, over 100,000 tokens. 1/ On May 3rd, Hyperliquid is launching staking tiers and updating its fee structure. Here's the impact traders, market makers, and Hyperliquid's revenue can expect: — Blockworks Research (@blockworksres) April 29, 2025 Changes are also afoot for makers. Most importantly, the criteria for getting a 0 bps maker fee have altered dramatically. In the past, traders with a 14-day volume of 25 million could access this premium rate. Now, the target has risen a staggering 25-fold to 500 million. This pushes mid-tier market makers out of the 0 bps tier and concentrates fee benefits at the top end of the volume spectrum. The lowest-volume makers under 5 million may see some slight improvements under the Diamond staking tier. But for everyone else, this whole scenario equates to increased costs. These changes will deal the hardest blow to the spot market. The increases in fees here are especially remarkable; some traders face hikes of up to 100%. Even the Gold-tier users—who are thought to be high-volume players—are looking at a 60% upswing in taker fees for the spot market. For makers of the spot market, the news is much worse: fees for volumes between 0 and 25 million, which used to feature 0 bps rates, now range between 1 bps and 0.6 bps (after discounts). That means fees are going up anywhere from 300% to 500% before we even consider tier-based reductions. This new model is a radical shift in Hyperliquid’s fee philosophy. The old structure allowed a very broad range of users to access low fees that were comparably equitable. The new model concentrates benefits among a quite exclusive group of users: whales and institutional traders. The cost advantages grow quite significantly with volume and token stakes, and die off just as you reach a low-volume, low-stake set of users—a.k.a. the retail traders. Staking Tiers and Protocol Revenue: Winners and Losers This new fee structure has its core in the introduction of HYPE staking tiers. Users can now lower their fees by locking up a significant amount of Hyperliquid’s native token. These tiers afford discounts of increasing magnitude. However, the most meaningful fee reductions occur at levels that are reachable only with very large amounts of HYPE—effectively pricing at small traders. This model gives clear incentives for long-term engagement and capital commitment. It seems designed to increase not just what is called “token velocity”—the rate at which a token is used in transactions—but also token demand and platform loyalty. The practical effect for most users, especially those unwilling or unable to commit large volumes of HYPE to stay engaged, will be higher trading costs, perhaps because of a disincentive to use HYPE in its native form. In terms of revenue, the changes are expected to be welcome for Hyperliquid. By expanding the base fee regime and raising the threshold for 0 bps eligibility, the protocol will pull in more fees from the vast swath of users who don’t earn the top discount rate. With even fewer traders accessing rates that are almost free and with trading activity at higher fee tiers, Hyperliquid’s protocol revenue ought to enjoy a welcome upturn. In summary, Hyperliquid’s update from May 3 now offers new incentives for whales and high-frequency institutional traders. But it puts retail participants and mid-sized market makers on a tighter-leashing and higher-cost path. The new structure indicates quite clearly who Hyperliquid wants to favor in its marketplace going forward. For most of the user base, it will now require either significantly more volume or capital to remain competitive. Disclosure: This is not trading or investment advice.

Two weeks ago, discussions around Bitcoin ( BTC ) and layer-1 protocols peaked during the market volatility brought on by the Trump administration’s sweeping tariffs. However, that’s since shifted to high market cap memecoins, Santiment marketing director Brian Quinlivan said in a May 1 blog post. “Online discussions about these high-risk tokens have proliferated as traders embrace a gamble mindset, rather than a calculated investment approach,” he said. “This is a telltale sign that traders are increasingly investing based solely on speculation and short-term gains,” Quinlivan added. Online discussions about memecoins have hit a 2025 high, surpassing discussions about Bitcoin. Source: Santiment Quinlivan said the overall crypto market rose 10% in the past eight days, but Bitcoin only gained 7%, which indicates traders are flocking to more speculative assets. “Any time Bitcoin leads an initial rally and then begins to move sideways, investors generally start taking bigger risks in hopes of scoring even higher returns through more speculative and riskier purchases,” he said. Dogecoin discussions spike on ETF news In particular, Dogecoin ( DOGE ) has seen a notable spike in positive crowd sentiment after a major decline in crowd interest during April, as various applications for DOGE exchange-traded funds were filed in the US. Despite the Securities and Exchange Commission delaying its decision on these filings until mid-June , Quinlivan says traders are in a state of cautious anticipation. “Until late April, DOGE had been on a major decline in terms of crowd interest. But its social dominance has spiked to its highest level in nearly three months, as the conversations and filings surrounding Nasdaq’s ETF listings have risen,” he said.

CoinGecko founder Bobby Ong said in a March 6 report that memecoin investor interest dropped after a series of bad launches, noting the fallout from the Libra (LIBRA) token launch in February as a significant catalyst.

Inspired by the legendary Golden Owl quest, Gowly offers an immersive journey : players must collect and analyze NFTs, solve intricate riddles and proceed step by step towards a major final reward. A Blockchain Puzzle Game Each riddle is encapsulated in a series of 9 NFTs. These tokens have visual, written or symbolic clues that must be decrypted in order to progress in the quest. In total : 6 main puzzles + a final riddle, to attempt to unlock the hidden key and win 1 Bitcoin. All transactions and game integrity are secured by the Solana blockchain. The native token, $GOWLY, is required to purchase NFTS on the dedicated marketplace w ww.enigmasolcoin.com A unique multisensory experience** Gowly goes beyond traditional visual or textual riddles by offering an immersive experience that engages multiple human senses. Some puzzles involve hearing, with auditory clues hidden within the NFTs—mysterious sounds, coded musical sequences, or encrypted voices. Each NFT can contain auditory, visual, or symbolic elements to decipher, transforming the treasure hunt into a fully immersive and engaging sensory journey. This original approach, enhanced by the owl’s graphic universe and the platform’s gamified interface, allows each player to fully immerse themselves in the quest, drawing on both intuition and analytical skills. A new form of interactive storytelling on the blockchain Gowly pushes the boundaries of traditional storytelling by blending interactive narrative, game mechanics, and Web3 technologies. Each NFT becomes a story fragment, a piece of a larger narrative puzzle where the player is both reader, investigator, and active participant. Unlike classic games, the order of solving isn’t always linear: clues can intersect, complement, or contradict one another, encouraging collaboration between players or the exchange of pieces through the marketplace. Thanks to the transparency of the Solana blockchain and a solution verification system secured by an independent notary, Gowly offers a playful, traceable, and fair adventure tailored to a new generation of connected, curious players eager for intellectual challenges. This unprecedented mix of gaming, digital art, and cryptography positions Gowly as a pioneering project in the Web3 gamified experience space. An Owl as a Guide…. and Treasure Keeper At the heart of the experience, there is the Golden Owl ‒ the projectʼs mascot and symbol ‒ which embodies the wisdom and complexity of the quest. Every player is invited to follow this owl in a step- by-step adventure, where each purchased NFT unlocks a new clue. Rewards & Gameplay 1 Bitcoin for the first player who solved all the riddles. Special NFTs and intermediate rewards (in $GOWLY and $SOL) are planned for each completed stage. A proof-of-solution system secured by an independent notary ensures the transparency of the process. From the Team -Gowldev Team ”We aim to bring back an adventure like the hunt for the Golden Owl, a quest that is both fun and mysterious, yet open to all, where the blockchain ensures the gameʼs reliability ” Useful links & Resources www.enigmasolcoin.com @GowlySolcoin t.me/gowlycoin PR Team : gowly@coinaute.com Disclaimer: This is a sponsored press release for informational purposes only.

As of the time of writing, the asset is trading at approximately $96,091, marking a 3.6% increase over the past week. This sustained climb follows a correction seen in early April and suggests that the broader market remains engaged, with momentum gradually building. As price action intensifies, analysts are increasingly focused on the indicators shaping short- to mid-term expectations. Among them is CryptoQuant contributor Axel Adler Jr., who recently shared new data indicating that Bitcoin’s on-chain momentum has entered what he calls the “start” rally zone, with a momentum ratio of approximately 0.8. This threshold is considered critical in assessing whether Bitcoin is likely to push higher or enter a period of consolidation. Related Reading: Bitcoin Sentiment Nearly Back To Neutral—Green Sign For Rally? Three Scenarios Shaping the Road Ahead In a QuickTake post titled “Bitcoin is warming up – 3 scenarios that could shape the next rally,” Adler outlined a set of possibilities based on current network data and previous cycle patterns. He describes an “optimistic” case where the momentum ratio climbs above 1.0 and holds, indicating a potential rally toward the $150,000–$175,000 range. This scenario mirrors historical breakout phases observed in 2017 and 2021, where a decisive break in key metrics sparked extended bullish runs. The “base case,” as Adler frames it, assumes that the momentum ratio stabilizes between 0.8 and 1.0, keeping Bitcoin in a broad trading range between $90,000 and $110,000. In this instance, market participants hold their positions but remain cautious about increasing exposure. A more conservative view, the “pessimistic” scenario, would be triggered if the ratio drops toward 0.75. This would suggest that short-term holders may begin taking profits, potentially leading to a correction in the $70,000–$85,000 zone. Adler emphasized, however, that with a recent correction already priced in, the optimistic and base case outcomes appear more plausible at present. Bitcoin Short-Term Holder Activity Signals Accumulation A separate analysis from CryptoQuant analyst Crypto Dan suggests further support for a bullish outlook. Dan notes that Bitcoin’s current structure bears similarities to past accumulation phases observed earlier in 2024. He highlights that in both January and October, rising activity from short-term holders—those who keep their coins for between one day and one week—preceded significant rallies. This behavioral trend has returned in recent days, which, according to Dan, often signals that the market is positioning for a larger move.

Peterson bases his prediction on three key data sets: trend analysis, seasonality, and market volatility. According to Peterson, the upward movement in the Bitcoin price is based on a trend that has been going on for 2 years. Stating that this trend is supported not only by technical analysis but also by fundamental dynamics such as “adoption economics”, the economist said, “If this trend continues, Bitcoin could rise above $ 135,000 in the coming period.” Peterson also drew attention to the seasonal fluctuations frequently observed in investment markets. He noted that Bitcoin has historically performed above average in June and July, similar to the increases in January and the holiday periods. Peterson argued that Bitcoin has performed below average since the beginning of 2025, and stated that the price could rise again thanks to the seasonal effect and the $130,000 level could be seen by August. Related News: ImportantMilestone for Surprise Altcoin: Total Transaction Count Exceeds 10 Billion Peterson, who also made evaluations on the volatility index (VIX), stated that the VIX falling below 18 indicates that “risk appetite” will revive. The economist, who explained that Bitcoin is currently highly correlated with NASDAQ and that the daily tracking error is below 5%, said, “If this correlation continues and VIX falls below 18, Bitcoin can rise to $ 107,000 in 2-3 weeks and above $ 135,000 in 100 days.” *This is not investment advice.

This week’s event is around average compared to previous weeks, while derivatives crypto trading has remained muted as spot markets show signs of recovery. Bitcoin Options Expiry This week’s batch of Bitcoin options contracts has a put/call ratio of 1, meaning that the short and long contract sellers are evenly matched. There is also a max pain point of $90,000, which is where most losses will be made on expiry. Moreover, open interest (OI), or the value or number of BTC options contracts yet to expire, is highest at the $100,000 strike price, with around $1.5 billion, indicating a bullish shift in sentiment as derivatives speculators bet on higher prices. However, there is a fair amount of OI at the $80,000 and $65,000 strike prices as the bears are keeping their short options open, according to Deribit. Options Expiry Alert At 08:00 UTC tomorrow, over $2.85B in crypto options are set to expire on Deribit. $BTC : $2.54B notional | Put/Call: 0.95 | Max Pain: $90K $ETH : $316M notional | Put/Call: 0.88 | Max Pain: $1,800 Market shows strong BTC call stacking above $95K, what… pic.twitter.com/imA4XY34Eq — Deribit (@DeribitOfficial) May 1, 2025 In a market update earlier this week, derivatives provider Greeks Live said “implied volatility is continuing to decline in the recent past, with short- and medium-term declines especially evident in BTC.” Analysts added that the market is not anticipating much volatility going forward. “Despite the BTC price oscillating at $95,000, market sentiment on the cryptocurrency side of the market is not high and can only be described as improving.” “Derivatives markets are still relatively subdued,” concurred Deribit before adding, “BTC volatility trades low and steep with short-dated smiles skewed neutral, and funding rates remain close to zero after some negative spikes.” In other words, short-term trading patterns appear neutral, and fees that traders pay to hold positions are staying close to zero. In addition to today’s tranche of Bitcoin options, there are around 175,000 Ethereum contracts that are also expiring today, with a notional value of $317 million, a max pain point of $1,800, and a put/call ratio of 0.87. This brings Friday’s combined crypto options expiry notional value to around $2.85 billion. Crypto Market Outlook Crypto markets appear to be ending the week on a high note, with total capitalization up marginally to reach $3.12 trillion after a week of trading sideways. Bitcoin was leading the pack as it has done all year, tapping $97,340 in an intraday high on Thursday. BTC had dipped just below $97,000 at the time of writing during the Friday morning Asian trading session, but was up 3% since the same time last week. Ethereum had made minor gains, reaching $1,860, its highest level for a month, but prices remain at crypto winter lows despite the 2% gain. Other altcoins doing well today include Dogecoin, Avalanche, Litecoin, and Hyperliquid .

Pseudonymous analyst Capo tells his 954,800 followers on the social media platform X that Bitcoin may decline more than 37% of its current value if it loses $92,000 as support. “After a strong bounce from April’s low at $75,000, BTC has now reached the $92,000-$98,000 target area I previously marked on the chart. To keep it simple: Above $92,000-$93,000: bullish, but strong resistance at $96,000-$98,000. Below $92,000: bearish. In my opinion, we’re seeing low timeframe distribution at these levels. Still, while it lasts, altcoins could keep pumping. I’ll start taking profits soon.” Source: Capo/X Looking at his chart, the analyst suggests Bitcoin could plummet to $60,000 if it fails to hold $92,000 as support. Bitcoin is trading for $96,608 at time of writing, up 2.6% in the last 24 hours. Next up, the analyst tells his 125,860 subscribers on his Telegram channel that he is remaining bullish on the graphics processing unit (GPU) rendering network altcoin Render ( RENDER ). “RENDER update (before and after). 60% up from entry. $4.25 level reclaimed. Looking good to reach the main target.” Source: Capo/Telegram Looking at his chart, the analyst suggests Render will next hit $6.58.

In a statement released Thursday , the company attributed the revenue jump to increased trading activity amid volatile conditions, despite noting a sequential decline of 7% from Q4 2024. Kraken Sees 17% EBITDA Growth Adjusted EBITDA also rose 17% year-over-year to $187.4 million, while overall trading volume on the platform surged by 29% over the same period. “While Q1 revenue declined 7% sequentially due to overall market softness, adjusted EBITDA rose 1% – highlighting Kraken’s resilience amid seasonality,” the company noted in a blog post. The statement added that Q4 2024 saw unusually high trading activity due to the U.S. election season, which tapered off in the following quarter. Kraken, which is preparing for a potential public listing in 2026, has continued to diversify its offerings. The company recently acquired NinjaTrader to enable derivatives trading in the U.S. and has expanded into equities and ETFs through a brokerage deal with Alpaca. In the UK, Kraken launched derivatives trading this week, marking a key move in its second-largest market. Kraken Head of Derivatives Alexia Theodorou emphasized that while spot and derivatives volumes are currently similar, derivatives hold significantly greater growth potential. The exchange also introduced Kraken Pay, a new consumer-focused financial app, alongside an institutional-grade API to enhance professional access.

Kraken also said it continues to gain market share and deepen client engagement despite macroeconomic uncertainty. Co-CEO Arjun Sethi reaffirmed Kraken’s plans to go public, even amid cooling IPO sentiment. Other exchanges like Bullish and Gemini have similarly signaled interest in entering public markets, although many remain cautious in light of unpredictable policy signals from the Trump administration. Kraken Mulls 2026 IPO Kraken is preparing for an initial public offering (IPO) as early as the first quarter of 2026, taking advantage of what appears to be a more favorable regulatory climate under President Donald Trump. Kraken’s IPO plans are not yet final and could change in the coming months. As reported, the SEC has agreed in principle to dismiss its lawsuit against cryptocurrency exchange Kraken, according to a statement from the company. The case will be dropped with prejudice, meaning it cannot be refiled. Kraken will not admit to any wrongdoing, pay penalties, or change its business operations. The SEC sued Kraken in November 2023 , alleging it operated as an unregistered securities exchange, broker, clearing agency, and dealer. The regulator also accused the company of commingling customer and corporate funds. Kraken contested the charges, leading a federal judge to rule the case had enough merit to proceed to trial.

On the other hand, newer utility projects like SUI are shining, as SUI emerges as one of the best performers for the week. However, the token that shines the most is FXGuys ($FXG), which has already been declared as one of the best Trade2Earn crypto platforms on the market. Take a look at where the XRP price prediction 2025 and the SUI price prediction 2025 are heading, and see how they compare to $FXG’s promising future. >>>JOIN FXGUYS HERE XRP Price Prediction 2025: Struggling To Hold Ground Amid Liquidations Ripple traders have had a very rough week so far. Namely, as the tariff-driven market crash started to fade, many altcoins, including XRP, rose in price. Naturally, Ripple traders expected XRP to hold its momentum, and many opened long positions to capitalize on this. However, the opposite happened, as the XRP price started falling even while most altcoins were still in the green. As a result, more than $10 million in long positions were liquidated in the span of 24 hours, which plummeted XRP’s open interest. This also showed that XRP isn’t as strong as many thought, and now experts’ XRP price prediction 2025 says that more decreases are on the way. At the moment, the XRP price is at $2.19, down over 8% in the last month. In the coming weeks, experts expect it to fall to $2 due to negative sentiment and increasing selling pressure. SUI Price Prediction 2025: Pokémon Rumours Send Price Soaring As mentioned, SUI absolutely ripped after the market crash, rising by over 60% in price in just one week. Now, the SUI price is at $3.56, and interest in SUI is climbing at massive speeds. Many say that SUI’s rally was sustained by rumours about a possible Pokémon partnership, as this could bring a huge wave of adoption for SUI if true. Even though nothing is confirmed, just the possibility of the partnership has brought in significant growth for SUI, upping its stablecoin and trading volume. With all these in mind, experts’ SUI price prediction 2025 is rather positive. They expect it to easily outperform XRP and reach $6 or more this year, marking a 68% rise from its current level. Enter FXGuys: One of the Most Lucrative Trade2Earn Crypto Platforms Available Now for the wildcard that’s set to outperform both XRP and SUI – FX Guys!

According to a May 1 announcement from the U.S. Department of the Treasury’s Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN), the agency is looking to label Huione Group as a “primary money laundering concern” and block it from accessing the American banking network FinCEN’s proposed rule would prevent U.S. financial institutions from opening or maintaining any correspondent or payable-through accounts for Huione Group. “Today’s proposed action will sever Huione Group’s access to correspondent banking, degrading these groups’ ability to launder their ill-gotten gains,” Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said in an accompanying statement. While the company doesn’t directly bank in the U.S., FinCEN claims it reportedly operates through overseas firms that do, giving it indirect access to the American financial system. Authorities say this access has allowed Huione to quietly support major cybercriminal operations, including laundering stolen crypto for North Korea’s notorious Lazarus Group. You might also like: Google delists Huione app after Elliptic report According to the financial crimes watchdog, the group allegedly helped move at least $4 billion in illicit funds between August 2021 and January 2025, with a notable portion of those funds linked to online scams, such as pig butchering . One of the biggest concerns is that Huione has built a sprawling network of businesses designed to support its operations. These include Huione Pay, a payment services firm; Huione Crypto, a virtual asset platform; and a controversial Telegram-based marketplace that recently rebranded to Haowang Guarantee. FinCEN also flagged Huione’s stablecoin, USDH , which is pegged to the U.S. dollar but designed in a way that makes it hard to freeze. Officials believe it’s being used to sidestep oversight and quietly funnel illicit funds into fiat currency. “Because Huione Group claims that USDH cannot be frozen, this service offers Huione Group’s clientele a virtually risk-free ecosystem to move or store CVC without the risk of interception or “freezing” by law enforcement,” FinCEN noted in its rulemaking submission. In July 2024, Tether froze nearly $30 million in USDT linked to Huoine accounts, which may have prompted the launch of USDH. The proposed rule is now open to public comment for 30 days before it can take effect. Back in July 2024, blockchain forensics firm Elliptic raised red flags around Huione, calling it a central hub for Southeast Asian cybercriminals. The report described the company’s marketplace as the biggest of its kind, with thousands of Telegram channels offering laundering services, scam website tools, and even human trafficking-related services. The platform’s mobile app was eventually delisted from the Google Play Store in January following criminal allegations, but it remains active on the Apple App Store.

Monitoring social commentary can be used alongside technical tools in a trading strategy, as positive chatter tends to support price rises, while negative chatter can fuel bearish trades. Online discussions around XRP are skewed toward bulls with few bearish outlooks, despite an overall drop in social discussions for XRP compared to other majors. The perceived likelihood of a spot XRP ETF approval by the end of 2025 has risen to 85%, up from 65% just two months ago, per Polymarket. Such a boost in confidence comes despite the SEC’s recent decision to delay rulings on spot DOGE and XRP ETF proposals until June 17. Technical analysis remains bullish, showing strong accumulation patterns in the current market lull. Online tone for Dogecoin has shifted dramatically following the April filings by 21Shares and Bitwise for DOGE spot ETFs. Until late April, DOGE was in a prolonged lull in social attention, but its social dominance has now surged to a three-month high, Santiment noted. The House of Doge and Dogecoin Foundation’s support for 21Shares’ application has added further credibility to the effort, helping DOGE shed some of its ""memecoin"" baggage. “After being seen mainly as a meme or joke coin, DOGE is now viewed as a more serious investment option with potential for wider adoption,” Santiment said. “Analysts and traders have noticed heavy accumulation by whales, with bullish patterns forming in the charts, which has added to the sense that Dogecoin may be entering a new growth phase,"" it added. Meanwhile, tokens like ether (ETH), Solana’s SOL and BNB show mixed social signals even as bitcoin staged a recovery above $97,000 early Friday.",Markets|Dogecoin|XRP|ETF|News,EN,0,0,DOGE|MARKET|SOL|TRADING|XRP,"{'name': 'CoinDesk', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/5/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coindesk,2025-05-02 07:21:19

Speaking on Fox Business Network on Thursday, Scott pointed out that 2-year Treasury yields have dropped below the federal funds rate, something that usually means traders expect the central bank to cut rates soon. “We are seeing that two-year rates are now below fed funds rates, so that’s a market signal that they think the Fed should be cutting,” Scott said. As of press time, the 2-year note yield was down to 3.7%, falling about five basis points that day. That’s now nearly 0.7% lower than the Fed’s current effective rate of 4.33%, according to data from CNBC. Source: CNBC Right now, the official Fed range sits between 4.25% and 4.50%, unchanged since it cut rates by a full percentage point late last year. Scott, who serves as the U.S. Treasury Secretary, said these numbers matter because he speaks with Fed Chair Jerome Powell every week. And this yield drop is going to be right at the center of their next meeting. He said the bond market is sending “a pretty direct message.” Traders expect full percentage point cut while Fed stalls The gap between the Fed’s policy rate and the 2-year Treasury yield has been growing for two months straight. That widening gap reflects how investors are betting on where monetary policy is headed. CME’s data shows that people in the fixed-income space have started betting on a full 1% cut before the end of the year. That’s double what the Fed’s own forecasts show right now. Scott claimed that his focus, and the focus of the Trump administration, is changing toward 10-year Treasury notes. Those affect consumer borrowing the most—mortgages, auto loans, and business credit. On Friday morning, the 10-year yield had dropped to 4.148%, down more than two basis points. The 2-year yield was also down more than one basis point, sitting at 3.607%. Since the Friday before Trump’s January inauguration, the 10-year yield has fallen by 0.5%. However, volatility has been extreme lately, and Scott said that’s because of the White House’s unpredictable rollout of tariffs. Source: CME While Scott looks at rates, investors are tracking what the Fed will actually do at its May 6-7 meeting. Right now, the CME FedWatch tool shows a 95% chance the Fed keeps rates steady next week. But beyond that? Markets are still expecting four rate cuts by the end of 2025. There’s a clear gap between what officials are saying and what investors are expecting. That pressure gets more intense when you bring inflation into the picture. On Wednesday, the personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price index (the Fed’s preferred inflation gauge) showed a 3.6% jump for the quarter. That’s way up from the 2.4% posted last quarter. Even core PCE, which strips out food and energy, rose 3.5%. It’s not the kind of inflation print that makes rate cuts easy to justify. Cryptopolitan Academy: Want to grow your money in 2025?

XRP’s explosive surge was fueled by a perfect storm of rising adoption, hype, and mainstream curiosity, a formula that rarely repeats. However, whispers across the crypto space suggest a new contender is stepping up, Mutuum Finance (MUTM). The token’s presale has exceeded $7.3 million while it has attracted over 9200 holders. Investors now invest at $0.025 knowing very well that the price will be at $0.03 when phase 5 starts. Current investors will see a 140% return on investment when the project is trading at $0.06 at launch. Mutuum Finance Presale Experiences Growth in Investor Demand Mutuum Finance is gaining traction as a new favorite among decentralized lending circles owing to its disruptive dual-lending model. During its presale, the project has gained 9200 investors and earned $7.3 million. With the ongoing presale, investors are witnessing an increase in Mutuum Finance token price from $0.025 to $0.03 during Phase 5. Industry experts have labeled Mutuum Finance as one of the most undervalued DeFi startups which can smash over a $5 worth after public launch. In a recent release, Mutuum Finance introduced a dynamic dashboard and a live leaderboard for the top 50 token holders. The top 50 holders of Mutuum Finance will be displayed and will also receive bonus tokens for maintaining their rank. The Mutuum Finance game-changing hybrid lending model merges Peer-to-Contract and Peer-to-Peer protocols to provide its community twin robust investing models. The P2C model enables users to invest in pools to receive passive USDT smart contract lending returns and the P2P model enables users to peer directly for lending and borrowing with no intermediary. The innovative merge of Peer-to-Contract and Peer-to-Peer lending models enables Mutuum Finance to provide investors with secure high-return services with an effective and decentralized platform. Creating a Stable and Secure DeFi Platform In order to offer long-term stability, Mutuum Finance is launching a completely collateralized, USD-backed stablecoin on the Ethereum blockchain. In contrast to earlier algorithmic stablecoins that failed, the stablecoin will be over-collateralized, with negligible risk and maximum trust. The platform also makes use of open financial architectures and audited smart contracts to address deficiencies that have hindered other DeFi projects. Rewarding Early Adopters and Growing the Community Mutuum Finance also focuses on increasing its user base through incentivizing schemes. The $100,000 giveaway will provide 10 rewards of $10,000 in MUTM tokens, and the referral program will provide rewards for referrals both individually and organizationally. Adopters of the platform will be provided VIP updates so that they will be engaged with the platform for the long term. Mutuum Finance is rapidly proving it has the potential to mirror the kind of explosive growth that Ripple (XRP) delivered in 2017. With over $7.3 million raised, more than 9,200 investors onboard, and token prices already set to climb from $0.025 to $0.03 in Phase 5, the momentum is undeniable. Early adopters stand to gain a 140% ROI when the price reaches $0.06, with projections pointing toward a possible $5 valuation at public launch. The opportunity to join a DeFi revolution led by a hybrid lending model, a USD-backed stablecoin, and exclusive rewards for early investors is now. Secure your position in the Mutuum Finance presale today and be part of the next parabolic run toward financial freedom.

The bounce has come against a backdrop of waning volatility, a drying supply of BTC on exchanges, and increasing on-chain accumulation. Miner Metrics Signal a Bottom Beyond the price action, Bitcoin maximalist Robert Breedlove sees a deeper story unfolding, one rooted in miner economics, long-term behavior, and global liquidity trends. According to him, BTC may be on the cusp of a major bull run, with key indicators flashing green. In a post on X, the podcast creator spotlighted a critical metric, the average miner cost of production, which he said has historically served as a reliable indicator of market bottoms. He noted that the average miner break-even cost has often coincided with major cycle bottoms since 2016. The premise isn’t far-fetched since assets rarely trade below their production cost in a rational market. This factor has often pushed out unprofitable miners, reducing supply and eventually pushing prices higher. Citing data from Blockware, Breedlove stated that currently, the average market break-even line is signaling another floor, potentially setting the stage for a fresh bull run. Another optimistic signal comes from Bitcoin’s long-term holders. These are investors who refuse to sell despite volatility. The analyst noted that over the past 30 days, such holders have accumulated an additional 150,000 BTC, creating the perfect condition for a supply shock and eventual price pump. On-chain data shows whales purchased roughly $4 billion worth of Bitcoin in the last two weeks of April, a trend paralleled by renewed inflows into spot BTC ETFs, which saw sustained accumulation from April 17 to April 30. Meanwhile, the amount of the flagship cryptocurrency on exchanges has fallen to a five-year low. “Bitcoin is running out of sellers in the $80K to $100K range,” Breedlove said, reinforcing the growing scarcity thesis. Liquidity Can Spur BTC Boom Further supporting his sunny outlook is a macroeconomic backdrop that’s becoming quite favorable for BTC. The market watcher drew attention to the cryptocurrency’s high correlation with the U.S. dollar and global fiat liquidity, a point often harped on by former BitMEX CEO Arthur Hayes. With central banks easing controls and rising global liquidity, the “What is Money” host expects more capital to flow into risk assets, including crypto. According to Breedlove, the rise of ETFs, institutional custody solutions, and BTC-backed financial products has only amplified this effect, making it easier for new money to flow into crypto. “Bitcoin is highly correlated to fiat liquidity – and that’s becoming increasingly more of the case as ETFs, Bitcoin Treasury Companies, and Convertible Bonds, provide easier access for new liquidity to enter the Bitcoin market.” The post Bitcoin Up 25% Since April: Expert Sees Bullish Signals in Miner Data appeared first on CryptoPotato .",BTCEUR|BTCGBP|BTCUSD|BTCUSDT|Crypto News|featured1|Bitcoin|Bitcoin (BTC) Price|Bitcoin Mining,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|FIAT|MARKET|TRADING,"{'name': 'Crypto Potato', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopotato.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopotato,2025-05-02 07:30:34

Shiba Inu turned a joke into a multi-billion-dollar movement. Pepe Coin sparked chaos with frog-fueled frenzy and overnight millionaires. But now, a growing number of holders from both camps are quietly shifting their gaze. Enter Remittix (RTX), a low-cap PayFi upstart that’s not barking or ribbiting, but building. With real-world utility baked in from day one and a $14.6 million presale already under its belt, RTX is being whispered about in crypto news sites and X threads as the next potential 1000x runner. While Shiba and Pepe built communities around culture, Remittix is doing something different: it’s fusing meme momentum with financial infrastructure. Could this be the moment where the next generational wealth play slips in under the radar? Let’s dig in. Remittix turns crypto into cash without breaking a sweat Remittix isn’t just another PayFi token; it’s fast becoming the backbone of a new financial era. At its core is a bold promise: to make crypto feel like cash, minus the middlemen. Users can instantly convert over 50 cryptocurrencies into 30+ fiat currencies, sending funds directly to any bank account worldwide. The kicker? Recipients never need to know the money began its life as crypto. With a flat fee structure and no hidden wire or FX costs, Remittix is leveling the playing field. But it’s not just for casual users. Businesses are catching on fast. The Remittix Pay API lets merchants accept crypto and settle in fiat with zero friction. From cross-border payroll to automated smart contract payouts, it’s built for scale. Now deep into its presale with 62.7% of tokens sold (nearly 531 million RTX claimed), Remittix is gathering momentum. For those watching the next big disruptor, this isn’t just a platform. It’s a movement. Shiba Inu’s rally falters as long-term holders start to rethink Shiba Inu ’s charm may have launched it to stardom, but the charts tell a sobering story. For the past three months, SHIB has been trapped in a stubborn downtrend, and recent attempts at recovery have fizzled out just as fast as they began. The Age Consumed metric has surged, signaling that long-term holders are unloading, likely in a bid to cut their losses as confidence wavers. Shiba Inu Age Consumed. Source: Santiment Even more telling is the MVRV Long/Short Difference, which shows short-term traders currently holding the profit edge. That dynamic often breeds volatility, as quick exits become more likely than conviction holds. In short, while SHIB’s community remains massive, the smart money appears cautious, and the token’s near-term trajectory looks shaky. It’s in moments like these, when sentiment cools and uncertainty rises, that some holders begin looking elsewhere. And lately, more eyes are drifting toward Remittix , where early momentum and real-world use are impossible to ignore. Pepe Coin eyes new highs as resistance levels crumble Pepe Coin’s recent performance paints a promising picture. After breaking out from a descending channel in late 2024, PEPE surged by 150 percent in a matter of days, quickly stabilizing above key resistance zones. Source: WorldOfCharts Last month, it tested the $0.0000225 price point, showing a solid 28 percent gain from its earlier low of $0.00001725. This upward movement has given investors renewed confidence, with many speculating a continuation of the bullish trend. With steady trading volume backing the price action and strong support at $0.0000220, PEPE seems poised for further gains. And as it trends upwards, investors are starting to look beyond PEPE, curious if other emerging coins like Remittix will follow suit. Final thoughts As Ethereum fuels DeFi’s latest bull run, tokens like Shiba Inu, Pepe Coin , and Remittix are riding the momentum in wildly different ways. While SHIB and PEPE lean on hype and technicals, Remittix brings real-world utility that’s hard to ignore. Its presale traction and crypto-fiat functionality hint at staying power. In a market full of moonshots, Remittix might just be the rare project built to actually land.

Bitcoin Long-Term Holder Profit Will Hit 350% At 99,900 In its latest weekly report, Glassnode has talked about the latest trend related to the Bitcoin long-term holders. The “long-term holders” (LTHs) refer to the Bitcoin investors who have been holding onto their coins since more than 155 days ago. The LTHs make up for one of the two main BTC holder cohorts divided on the basis of holding time, with the other side being known as the “short-term holders” (STHs). Related Reading: Bitcoin Sentiment Nearly Back To Neutral—Green Sign For Rally? Statistically, the longer an investor holds onto their coins, the less likely they become to sell them at any point, so the LTHs with their long holding times can be considered more resolute than the STHs. Below is the chart shared by the analytics firm that shows how the total supply held by these HODLers has changed during the last couple of years. As is visible in the graph, the Bitcoin LTH Supply has witnessed an increase over the past two months or so, a sign that some STHs have been maturing into the cohort. In total, the metric has gone up by 254,000 BTC during this period. While the LTHs tend to be resolute entities, it’s not as if they never sell at all. From the chart, it’s apparent that these diamond hands took profits during both the major rallies from last year. Recently, BTC has once again been trying to put together bullish momentum, but the continued uptrend in the LTH Supply implies these HODLers haven’t decided to sell yet. As for when this cohort would become enticed enough to sell, perhaps history can provide a hint or two. In the chart, Glassnode has attached the data for the average cost basis or Realized Price of the LTHs and some price lines that correspond to a specific degree of profit/loss for this cohort. At present, the BTC price is far above the LTH Realized Price, so the members of this group would be carrying a significant amount of profit. Despite this fact, these HODLers don’t seem to be willing to part with their coins just yet. As for when their tune might change, the report has explained: Historically speaking, the Long-Term Holder cohort typically ramps up their spending pressure when the average member is holding a +350% unrealized profit margin. Related Reading: Old Bitcoin Whales Resurface With $760M Move—Brace For Impact? Based on their current cost basis, the LTHs can be expected to reach this 350% profit threshold when Bitcoin hits the $99,900 mark. Thus, if BTC’s recovery run continues this far, it’s possible that the cryptocurrency might find some trouble due to the HODLer selling. BTC Price At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading around $96,500, up around 4% in the last seven days.

When the lines blur between man and machine, you’re looking at artificial general intelligence (AGI). Unlike its counterpart, artificial narrow intelligence (ANI), which is the use of AI for solving individual problem statements, AGI represents artificial intelligence that can understand, learn and apply knowledge in a way that is indistinguishable from human cognition. AGI is still theoretical, but the prospect of artificial intelligence being able to holistically replace human input and judgment has naturally attracted plenty of interest, with researchers, technologists and academics alike seeking to bring the concept of AGI to reality. Yet another strand of prevailing research seeks to explore the feasibility and implications of AGI vs. ANI in a world increasingly shaped by AI capabilities. Indeed, while ANI has already transformed various industries, AGI’s potential goes far beyond. Imagine a world where machines can not only assist humans in their tasks but also proactively understand the drivers behind specific tasks, predict outcomes, and autonomously create innovative solutions to achieve optimal results. This paradigm shift could revolutionize healthcare, education, transportation and countless other fields. Why is AGI so powerful? Unlike ANI, AGI is not confined to pre-programmed tasks or predefined responses within a limited domain. Instead, it has the potential to generate and apply knowledge across various contexts. Imagine a self-driving car powered by AGI. It can collect a passenger from a train station but also personalize the journey with custom recommendations for pit stops, sightseeing avenues or navigating unfamiliar roads to arrive at the desired destination. And because it’s a machine, AGI would not experience fatigue and would continue learning and improving at exponential speeds. Here’s a definition of AGI by Vitalik Buterin , who highlights the sheer potential of AGI: The example highlights some interesting features of AGI, which include: Learning capability: AGI can learn from experiences and improve its performance over time without a concerted effort by human programmers to perform additional data set training . This learning is not limited to specific tasks and instead encompasses a broad spectrum of activities. Problem-solving skills: AGI can solve complex problems by applying logical reasoning just as a human would. This includes consideration of non-traditional variables, such as emotional impact, which can highlight an even wider range of potential outcomes. Adaptability: AGI can adjust to new situations and environments without explicit programming, which means it can thrive in dynamic and unpredictable settings. Understanding and interpretation: AGI is equipped to comprehend natural language, abstract concepts and emotional nuance, allowing for sophisticated human-machine interactions. Did you know? Blockchain timestamps could serve as a legal memory for AGI systems, allowing future audits to determine exactly what an AGI knew — and when. The pursuit of AGI: Where does it stand as of April 2025? AGI is currently the science-fiction version of AI. However, while still theoretical, the sheer potential of the concept makes AGI the science fiction equivalent of artificial intelligence. While existing models, such as ChatGPT , are constantly evolving and improving with each day, the journey to bringing AGI to life involves overcoming significant technical challenges, such as: Defining the tech stack: The purely hypothetical nature of AGI makes it exceedingly difficult, if not altogether impossible, to determine the precise nature of the technological stack required for practical implementation. Neural networks: Advances in deep learning have propelled this field forward, but AGI would also require specialist neural networks that mimic the human brain’s structure to process information and introduce a layer of emotion and nuance. Natural language processing (NLP): Significant advances are required in the field of NLP to enable machines to better understand and generate human language, incorporating nuance, emotion and complexities. This includes a more complex analysis of language syntax, semantics and context, which is still evolving in traditional machine learning models that leverage NLP. Reinforcement learning: Using reward-based mechanisms to teach machines to make decisions would allow AGI to learn optimal behaviors through trial and error. Despite advancements, creating AGI that can truly think like a human remains an elusive goal. Did you know? DeepMind warns that not all AI risks come from the machines themselves — some start with humans misusing them. In its paper titled ‘An Approach to Technical AGI Safety and Security’, DeepMind identifies four key threats: misuse (bad actors using AI for harm), misalignment (AI knowingly going against its developer’s intent), mistakes (AI causes harm without realizing it), and structural risks (failures that emerge from complex interactions between people, organizations, or systems). Can AGI think like a human? The question of whether AGI can think like a human delves into the very core of human cognition. Human thinking is characterized by consciousness, emotional depth, creativity and subjectivity. While AGI can simulate certain aspects of human thought, replicating the full spectrum of human cognition is a formidable challenge. Several dimensions of human cognition are particularly difficult to emulate: Consciousness and self-awareness: One of the defining traits of human thinking is consciousness, the awareness of oneself and one’s surroundings. AGI, as sophisticated as it may become, lacks the intrinsic human ability to introspect. AGI operates on an underlying set of algorithms and complex, learned patterns, without any subjectivity or genuine emotion. Emotional intelligence: Humans experience a wide range of emotions that influence their decisions, behaviors and interactions. While AGI can be trained to recognize and respond to such emotions, the lack of genuine emotional experience means that it cannot wholly replicate these emotions. Emotional intelligence in humans involves empathy, compassion and moral considerations, elements that are challenging to encode into machines. Creativity and innovation: Creativity involves generating novel ideas and solutions, often through intuitive leaps and imaginative thinking. AGI can mimic creativity by combining existing knowledge in new ways, but it lacks the intrinsic motivation and subjective insight that drive human innovation. True creativity stems from emotional experiences, personal reflections and cultural contexts, which AGI cannot authentically replicate. Key benefits of AGI The litmus test for AGI lies in its ability to holistically replicate a human experience. When realized, the potential benefits are enormous and stretch across various industries, spawning various aspects of daily life. Despite its limitations, AGI is increasingly viewed as a force for good across a range of industries, including: Healthcare: AGI can assist in diagnosing diseases, developing personalized treatment plans and predicting customized health outcomes, leveraging a vast body of underlying training data. Education: It can provide customized learning experiences, tutoring and academic research support. AGI can adapt to individual learning styles and pace, enhancing educational outcomes. Economics: It can optimize financial models, predict market trends, and enhance productivity. It can analyze economic data to forecast market trends and guide investment decisions. Environmental Science: AGI can analyze climate data, model ecological impacts, and propose sustainable solutions. Additionally, AGI’s potential extends to areas such as transportation, communication and entertainment, offering new frontiers for innovation. Did you know? Some futurists believe AGI systems could eventually negotiate with each other autonomously using blockchain-based smart contracts — forming agreements, trading data or even co-developing solutions without human intervention. Ethical and societal considerations The rise of AGI raises significant ethical and societal questions. While powerful, AGI requires careful consideration for safe usage, which has prompted the creation of nonprofit societies, such as the AGI Society, as shown in the image below. Fundamentally, it is crucial to address concerns such as: Safety: Ensuring AGI operates within safe and controlled parameters to prevent unintended consequences. This includes robust testing and the introduction of regulatory frameworks to oversee AGI deployment. Privacy: Protecting personal data from misuse by AGI systems. As AGI can process vast amounts of data, safeguarding privacy is paramount. Bias and fairness: Preventing discriminatory practices and ensuring equitable access to AGI benefits. Developers must ensure that AGI systems are free from biases that could lead to unfair treatment. Employment: Addressing the impact of AGI on job displacement and workforce dynamics. As AGI automates tasks, there is a need to consider its impact on employment and provide support for affected workers. The integration of AGI into society requires a thoughtful approach to its governance, ensuring that it serves the common good and respects social values. Can blockchain power AGI? AGI could create computers as smart as humans, revolutionizing fields like cryptocurrency trading or market analysis. But AGI needs trust and fairness to work for everyone. Blockchain, the tech behind Bitcoin and Ethereum, offers a secure, transparent way to make this happen. Here’s how blockchain can supercharge AGI with crypto-inspired solutions: Clear training records: Blockchain works like Bitcoin’s open transaction log, recording every piece of data (e.g., crypto trading patterns) used to train AGI. This helps ensure the system is fair and free from hidden biases. Shared decision-making: Similar to Ethereum’s smart contracts , blockchain will allow developers, traders and users to vote on AGI’s rules, ensuring no single company controls it. Safe data sharing: Like crypto wallets safeguarding funds, blockchain could protect sensitive data from crypto exchanges, allowing secure sharing for AGI training without leaks. Rewards for fairness: Developers who build unbiased AGI, such as accurate trading predictors, could earn digital tokens, just like crypto mining rewards, encouraging ethical work. However, ongoing challenges such as blockchain’s slow speed, delays in crypto transactions and limited storage capacity could make it hard for AGI to process data quickly or handle large datasets. To make blockchain AGI-ready, researchers are already exploring: Offchain storage: Decentralized systems like InterPlanetary File System (IPFS) are used to store large files offchain, while the blockchain keeps only verifiable hashes, reducing congestion. Sharding and danksharding: Like Ethereum’s scalability upgrades, sharding splits data across multiple nodes, allowing AGI to process more information without slowing down the network. Also, danksharding , an advanced form of sharding being developed for Ethereum, combines rollups and data availability sampling to scale data access efficiently — ideal for real-time AGI applications. Data pruning: Advanced blockchain models like Decentralized Artificial Intelligent Blockchain-based Computing Network (DAIBCN) prune old or irrelevant data, keeping the system lean and optimized for high-demand tasks like AGI. DAIBCN also enables secure, distributed AI computing — blending blockchain trust with AI performance. The future of AGI Artificial general intelligence represents the pinnacle of AI development, promising capabilities that rival human intellect. While AGI can simulate aspects of human thinking, achieving true human-like cognition remains a distant goal. Consciousness, emotional depth and creativity are intrinsic to human experience and pose significant challenges for AGI. Nevertheless, the pursuit of AGI continues to drive innovation and reshape our understanding of intelligence. As we advance toward this frontier, it is imperative to navigate ethical considerations and societal impacts to responsibly harness AGI’s potential. Ongoing research, identifying practical opportunities and technical requirements, and initiating dialogue across society are all essential steps to address the challenges and opportunities posed by AGI. The future of AGI holds promise, but it requires a balanced approach to ensure that its eventual integration into society enhances human well-being and respects ethical standards.",Artificial general intelligence|AGI,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|ETH|MARKET|TRADING|RESEARCH,"{'name': 'CoinTelegraph', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cointelegraph.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cointelegraph,2025-05-02 07:33:00

Besides, the volume, which had dropped significantly, has begun to rise, which suggests the bulls are barging into the markets. Besides, the Bitcoin price has surged above $97,000 and continues to show massive strength as it displays signs of recovery. With this, the sentiments are flipping in favor of the bulls, which may revamp a strong ascending trend in the coming days. Presently, the Bitcoin price is just 14% away from its ATH at above $109,000, and the recent change in the market sentiments has increased the optimism around the markets. Meanwhile, the Bitcoin volume that had dropped below $20 billion has risen back above $30 billion, which could increase the volatility of the token. The star token has been attracting more than half of the trading volume, as the BTC dominance remains on the rise. Now that the dominance has reached a 4-year high, a strong bull run is expected to begin anytime from now. The BTC dominance chart seems to be on track to mark the previous highs above 70%. Interestingly, these levels were during the 2018 and 2021 bull runs, which suggests the BTC price is in the middle of the 2025 bull run. Therefore, the BTC price is believed to maintain a healthy ascending trend throughout May 2025 and probably rise back above $100K. Bitcoin (BTC) Price Prediction for May 2025 In the short term, the Bitcoin price is poised to face some bearish action, which could drag the levels below $96,000. However, this could be a short-term pullback as the price remains highly bullish in the long term, with the potential to reach $110K before the end of the month. The weekly price action of Bitcoin suggests the token is in the middle of a strong bull run as the sentiments flipped in favour soon after the rebound from the support. Meanwhile, the CMF drops below 0, hinting towards a rise in the bearish strength within the markets. On the other hand, the weekly Bull Market Support Band (BMSB) is about to undergo a bullish crossover, which could validate the start of a bullish trend. Therefore, the Bitcoin (BTC) price appears to be primed to rise above the psychological barrier at $100K in the next few days and reach $105K by the end of the month.",Price Analysis|Bitcoin,EN,0,0,BTC|MARKET|TRADING,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-05-02 07:37:55

The TRON network has just hit a colossal milestone, officially surpassing 10 billion total transactions. This isn’t just a number; it’s a powerful indicator of the network’s widespread adoption and consistent activity. If you’re keeping an eye on TRON cryptocurrency or the broader blockchain space, this development is definitely worth diving into. Decoding the TRON Transaction Milestone According to insights shared by CryptoQuant on X (formerly Twitter), the TRON network has logged over 10,000,000,000 transactions since its inception. To put that into perspective, that’s a staggering amount of activity flowing through the network, representing countless transfers, smart contract interactions, and dApp usages. What’s even more impressive is the sustained daily activity. The network currently averages around 8.4 million transactions per day. While daily numbers can fluctuate based on market conditions and network usage, this consistent high volume underscores TRON’s position as one of the busiest blockchains globally. The blockchain transaction volume on TRON hasn’t just appeared overnight. The data from CryptoQuant highlights a steady upward trend in transaction volume, with notable surges corresponding to periods of heightened market excitement, particularly during the bull runs of 2021 and 2023. This suggests a strong correlation between overall crypto market sentiment and activity on the TRON network. What Fuels the Surge in TRON Network Activity? Hitting 10 billion transactions isn’t accidental. Several key factors contribute to the high TRON transactions volume. Understanding these drivers gives us better insight into the network’s utility and growth: USDT Dominance: A significant portion of TRON’s transaction volume comes from the stablecoin Tether (USDT). TRON has become one of the most popular networks for transferring USDT due to its speed and low fees. Many users and businesses prefer using TRC-20 USDT for remittances, trading, and payments. Low Transaction Fees: Compared to networks like Ethereum, TRON offers significantly lower transaction costs. This makes it attractive for frequent transactions, especially for smaller amounts, driving higher volume. Focus on dApps and Ecosystem: TRON has actively fostered a decentralized application (dApp) ecosystem, including DeFi protocols, gaming, and social media platforms. While perhaps not as large as some competitors, activity within these dApps contributes to the overall transaction count. Market Speculation and Trading: As highlighted by the surges in 2021 and 2023, increased trading activity on exchanges that support TRON tokens, as well as general market hype, naturally leads to more transactions as users move funds or participate in trading strategies. Network Efficiency: TRON’s delegated Proof-of-Stake (DPoS) consensus mechanism allows for faster transaction processing times compared to Proof-of-Work (PoW) chains, enabling it to handle high volumes efficiently. The interplay of these factors creates a powerful engine for generating blockchain transaction volume on TRON. Comparing TRON’s Transaction Volume How does TRON’s 10 billion milestone stack up against other major blockchains? While direct comparisons based solely on total transactions can be nuanced (different chains have different transaction types and structures), looking at cumulative volume and daily activity provides context. Ethereum, being the oldest smart contract platform, also boasts a massive cumulative transaction count. However, Ethereum’s higher gas fees mean its daily transaction count is often lower than TRON’s, especially for simple transfers. Binance Smart Chain (BSC), now BNB Chain, also sees high daily transaction volumes, often competing closely with or surpassing TRON on certain days, largely driven by DeFi and gaming activity. What the CryptoQuant data on TRON’s 10 billion milestone clearly shows is that TRON is firmly established as one of the most actively used blockchains in the world, particularly for value transfer via stablecoins. The Significance of 10 Billion TRON Transactions Reaching this milestone isn’t just a vanity metric. It signifies several important aspects about the TRON network : Robust Adoption: 10 billion transactions indicate significant real-world use and adoption, whether for transfers, dApps, or other purposes. Network Stability and Scalability: Handling such massive volume over time demonstrates the network’s ability to scale and remain operational under heavy load. Ecosystem Utility: High transaction count suggests that the applications and services built on TRON are seeing usage. Investor Confidence: A highly active network can be seen as a positive sign by investors, suggesting underlying demand and utility for the TRON cryptocurrency (TRX). While transaction count alone doesn’t tell the whole story (the nature and value of transactions also matter), reaching 10 billion is undeniably a major achievement that highlights TRON’s position in the blockchain landscape. Are There Challenges or Considerations? It’s important to look at the full picture. While high TRON transactions are positive, some considerations exist: Transaction Nature: As mentioned, a large portion is stablecoin transfers. While valid use cases, it’s different from a network driven primarily by complex DeFi interactions or NFTs. Centralization Concerns: TRON’s DPoS model, while fast, involves a relatively small number of ‘Super Representatives’ validating transactions, leading to concerns about centralization compared to networks with wider validator distribution. Spam Transactions: Like any network with low fees, there’s always the potential for a percentage of transactions to be low-value or even spam, though mechanisms exist to mitigate this. Understanding these points provides a more balanced view of the 10 billion transaction milestone. Actionable Insights and Future Outlook For users and investors interested in the TRON network and TRON cryptocurrency , this milestone offers several insights: Confirmation of Utility: The high transaction volume confirms that TRON has found significant product-market fit, particularly in the stablecoin transfer space. Indicator of Network Health: Sustained high activity is generally a positive indicator of a network’s health and relevance. Watch Stablecoin Trends: Given the reliance on USDT, monitoring stablecoin regulations and usage trends is crucial for understanding future TRON transaction volume. Evaluate Ecosystem Growth: Look beyond just transaction numbers to assess the growth and adoption of specific dApps and DeFi protocols on TRON. The future of blockchain transaction volume on TRON will likely depend on its ability to maintain its competitive edge in fees and speed, continued growth of its ecosystem, and the broader regulatory environment for stablecoins. Compelling Summary TRON’s achievement of 10 billion total transactions is a monumental feat, solidifying its position as a major player in the blockchain space. Driven by factors like efficient USDT transfers, low fees, and growing ecosystem activity, the network demonstrates robust adoption and operational capability, as highlighted by the CryptoQuant data. While challenges and considerations exist, this milestone underscores the significant utility and widespread use of the TRON network and its associated TRON cryptocurrency. It’s a testament to the network’s infrastructure handling massive blockchain transaction volume consistently, pointing towards its continued relevance in the fast-evolving world of decentralized technology.

According to him, if Bitcoin manages to reclaim its broken parabolic trendline, it could surge to a cycle peak between $125,000 and $150,000 by August or September 2025. But Brandt also warns that, after that, Bitcoin could face a sharp correction of over 50%. Let’s dive in detail! Parabolic Recovery Could Lead To $125k – $150K Rally Yes, you read that right, Bitcoin might be on its way to a six-figure price tag. The chart shared by Peter Brandt highlights a red curved line, which represents a long-term parabolic trend that has supported Bitcoin’s biggest bull runs in the past. Hey @scottmelker If Bitcoin can regain the broken parabolic slope then $BTC is on target to reach the bull market cycle top in the $125k to $150K level by Aug/Sep 2025, then a 50%+ correction pic.twitter.com/WUUzxl0ckn — Peter Brandt (@PeterLBrandt) May 1, 2025 However, Bitcoin has recently fallen below this curve, raising doubts about whether it can recover its strong upward momentum. As of now, Bitcoin is hovering around $96,797 , with its 18-week moving average (WMA) near $89,027, and the simple moving average (SMA) around $86,052. If Bitcoin can bounce back above the broken parabolic curve, Brandt sees a clear path toward his $125K–$150K price target, by August & september 2020. Further, the chart also includes a red dot around the $130,000 level, marking the possible cycle top if the parabolic strength returns. From $96K to $150K… Then a 50% Drop? Brandt warns that after reaching the projected high, Bitcoin could face a 50% or greater correction, which is consistent with past cycle behavior. A 50% drop from $125K–$150K would bring BTC back to around $62K–$75K. So while the upside is exciting, the volatility risk is just as real. This type of correction has happened before, and Brandt expects history to repeat. What About a $1 Million Price Target? Following Brandt’s tweet , one user raised a key question: Can Bitcoin ever hit $1 million if it stays within this long-term upper curve? Brandt gave a straightforward reply: “The only scenario that could change would be sudden destruction of USD, which could cause hyper thrust through upper curve — ala interest rates in Germany in the 1920s.” In simple terms, Brandt believes that for Bitcoin to break beyond this long-term channel and aim for $1 million, it would take an extreme event, like a collapse of the U.S. dollar or major global financial disruption. Otherwise, the chart suggests that such levels may remain out of reach within the current trend.",News,EN,0,0,BTC|MARKET|TRADING,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-05-02 07:45:49

BOOP has gone up more than 200%. On May 2, the on-chain analysis platform Bubblemaps showed traders the token distribution for Boop crypto amidst growing buzz surrounding the launchpad’s reward mechanism. According to the official tokenomics, 50% of the tokens will be allocated to a rewards pool for creators and holders. One of the platform’s unique features is its rewards program that grants Boop tokens to “graduate cults,” which are tokens created on the platform that meet certain milestone criteria. However, traders have grown skeptical of whether the platform will deliver on this promise. Determined to verify the information, Bubblemaps’ visualization reveals the project’s token distribution matches its tokenomics claim, with that the biggest allocation of Boop tokens going into the rewards pool. Meanwhile, 15% of its token supply has been set aside for airdrops and 10% goes to the project team.

Launched on May 1, $BOOP is the token of new Solana ( SOL ) -based meme coin launch platform Boop.fun. It bears the icon of an animated blue cat winking. The meme coin launchpad was reportedly founded by NFT whale and crypto influencer Dingaling. What sets the platform apart from other meme coin launchpads like Pump.fun and PancakeSwap is that boop.fun distributes transaction fees to BOOP token holders through its rewards program. So far, the platform claims it has allocated at least 150 million Boop crypto to be distributed to active users and influencers through a series of airdrops. In a partnership with KaitoAI, the platform identifies top X “influencers” based on followers, engagement, and meme-related activity, sorting them into tiers. Users must create a boop “cult” after creating an account via X to claim airdrops. Airdropped tokens are locked for 30 days, with faster unlocking depending on the token’s performance. However, this mechanism has sparked trader speculation, due to concerns about potential exploitation if not properly managed.

While coinbase coinbase - support@coinbase.com Wallet Centralised Exchange has not explicitly accused Movement Labs of misconduct, the timing follows a contentious $38 million token dump involving a now-terminated market maker. Why Coinbase is Delisting $MOVE Token? The MOVE token initially gained traction with significant funding, major exchange listings, and considerable hype. However, the project’s reputation was severely dented when internal documents suggested mismanagement within Movement Labs. Allegedly, Rentech, a firm tied to both Movement Labs and the disputed market maker, had undue influence over the token’s market behavior. A leaked chat and subsequent market manipulation exposed these flaws. The $38 million USDT sell-off triggered a sharp decline in MOVE’s price, drawing the attention of the Movement Network Foundation, which has since initiated an independent investigation. To mitigate the fallout, a reserve fund was established to repurchase the dumped tokens. Move Token Delisting In response to these revelations, Coinbase acted swiftly, moving MOVE into limit-only mode before formally announcing its delisting. This decision has fueled skepticism surrounding the project’s governance practices, raising questions about the transparency of its token economy and the accountability of its executives. Binance also reacted by banning Web3Port , and although Movement Labs pledged to repurchase the dumped tokens, it has yet to fulfill this commitment. The promised airdrop has also been delayed, adding to the growing discontent among the community. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : MOVE Token Scandal News: Who & How Market Manipulation Led to Massive Price Drop , MOVE Price Impact The price of MOVE suffered an immediate hit, falling more than 20% to $0.18 after the announcement. Although the price stabilized slightly at $0.20, the market cap of MOVE dropped below $500 million for the first time, reflecting investor concerns. At its peak, MOVE had reached $0.70, but it is now down by a staggering 73% from its all-time high. Despite Bitcoin’s rally to a 70-day high , MOVE’s sharp decline emphasizes how project-specific issues can outweigh broader market trends. The steepest one-day drop since the token’s launch in December signals deepening mistrust in its future. Community Response The reaction within the Movement’s Telegram channel has been one of disbelief. While some users expressed gratitude for avoiding the token, others criticized it as another scam. A community manager clarified that the action was a “suspension” and not a permanent delisting, assuring users that talks with Coinbase were ongoing. However, trust in the project’s governance remains shaky, with many unsure about MOVE’s long-term viability. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

After months of bearish pressure, ETH is attempting to reclaim key resistance levels that could determine its trajectory for the rest of Q2 2025. While the market remains cautious, several technical indicators are beginning to show signs of strength. Weekly Chart: Ethereum Testing Major Fibonacci Support Ethereum price prediction (Source: TradingView.) On the weekly timeframe, Ethereum is recovering from the 0.786 Fibonacci retracement level around $2,075, derived from the $1,097 low to the $4,105 cycle high. This region has historically served as a rebound zone for ETH. Current zone : ETH sits just below the 0.786 Fib at $2,075. Bullish recovery : If Ethereum closes a weekly candle above $2,100, a shift toward the 0.618 Fib at $2,508 becomes plausible. Risk level : A breakdown below $1,700 would suggest continued weakness, potentially targeting $1,457.

According to CoinGecko data, the liquid staking protocol Haedal (HAEDAL) rallied to an intraday high of $0.174 during Asia morning hours on May 2, marking over 100% gains from its post-launch lows. Its market cap touched $32 million, and daily trading volume climbed 20% from the previous day, hitting around $180 million. The key catalyst behind today’s move was Bithumb, a major South Korea-based crypto exchange, which announced the addition of a KRW trading pair for the HAEDAL token set at 6:00 PM KST on Friday, May 2, 2025. This makes Bithumb the latest exchange to pick up HAEDAL, following earlier listings on Binance Alpha , Bybit, KuCoin, and MEXC on April 29, shortly after Haedal’s token generation event and mainnet launch on the same day. At launch, the total HAEDAL token supply was set at 1 billion. Activity in HAEDAL’s derivatives market spiked after the news broke. Data from CoinGlass shows open interest in HAEDAL futures soared 210% in just 24 hours, crossing $45 million. The funding rate remained steady at 0.0050%, signaling that most traders are holding bullish positions and betting the rally will continue. At launch, Haedal protocol distributed 5% of its total supply, or 50 million HAEDAL tokens, through an airdrop aimed at users active in its products and Sui ecosystem partnerships. However, just hours later, the token price dropped nearly 50% as many community members rushed to cash out their airdropped tokens.

He posted the threat on Truth Social, writing: “Any Country or person who buys ANY AMOUNT of OIL or PETROCHEMICALS from Iran will be subject to, immediately, Secondary Sanctions. They will not be allowed to do business with the United States of America in any way, shape, or form.” This message followed Trump’s February decision to launch what he called a “maximum pressure” campaign aimed at completely halting Iran’s oil exports. At the White House on Thursday, he claimed Iran continues to fund militant groups across the Middle East using oil revenues. According to data from CNBC, the oil market responded right away as US crude futures went up by $1.03, or 1.77%, closing at $59.24 per barrel. Brent, the global oil benchmark, climbed $1.07, or 1.75%, ending at $62.13. Iran remains a top oil producer within OPEC, so any talk of sanctions instantly affects pricing. Trump takes aim at China and starts talks with Iran The White House didn’t directly name China, but Scott Modell, who runs Rapidan Energy and is a former CIA officer, said the message clearly pointed to Beijing. China is reportedly importing over 1 million barrels a day from Iran. Modell told CNBC that unless the administration specifically hits China’s state-owned companies and the infrastructure that supports those oil flows, those barrels will keep moving. “Trump’s comments don’t signify a change in the administration’s drive to reach a new deal with Iran but rather underscore Trump’s belief in negotiating through strength,” Modell said . Even with all the pressure, Trump isn’t closing the door on talks. In April, he opened negotiations with Iranian officials in Oman. The focus was Iran’s nuclear program. Back in February, he said the goal was to stop Iran from getting a nuclear weapon, though Tehran denies it wants one. He added that he would rather negotiate a new agreement than keep escalating tensions. This approach isn’t new. During his first term, Trump pulled the US out of the 2015 nuclear deal brokered by Barack Obama. Since then, his administration has worked to squeeze Iran’s economy, especially its oil exports, as hard as possible. One more move came earlier in April, when Trump slapped “secondary tariffs” on countries buying oil from Venezuela, another member of OPEC. Just like with Iran, the goal is to block revenue from flowing to governments he wants to isolate. Cryptopolitan Academy: Want to grow your money in 2025?

44058538,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=154493,1746172248,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Crucial Clash: Nvidia Takes Aim at Anthropic Over AI Chip Export Controls,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/nvidia-ai-chip-dispute/,"In the fast-paced world where technology policy significantly impacts global markets, including sectors relevant to cryptocurrency and digital innovation, a notable dispute has emerged. Tech giant Nvidia is publicly challenging fellow AI leader Anthropic over its support for new US government restrictions on exporting advanced AI chips . This disagreement highlights the complex landscape of international trade policy and its direct consequences for leading technology firms. Why Are AI Chips at the Center of This Dispute? Advanced AI chips , particularly those used for training large language models and complex AI systems, are considered critical technology. The US government, through the Department of Commerce, is implementing what it calls the “Framework for Artificial Intelligence Diffusion.” This framework, set to impose sweeping restrictions starting May 15th, aims to control the diffusion of advanced AI technology to certain countries, notably China. Here’s a quick breakdown of the core positions: Anthropic’s Stance: Anthropic has voiced support for these export controls. They argue that strict controls are necessary to prevent sensitive AI technology from falling into potentially adversarial hands. Interestingly, Anthropic representatives reportedly used vivid, albeit unusual, examples like chips being smuggled in “baby bumps” or “alongside live lobsters” to emphasize the perceived need for stringent measures. Nvidia’s Stance: Nvidia, a primary producer of these high-end AI chips, strongly disagrees with Anthropic’s position and the upcoming controls. A spokesperson for Nvidia told CNBC, “American firms should focus on innovation and rise to the challenge, rather than tell tall tales that large, heavy, and sensitive electronics are somehow smuggled in ‘baby bumps’ or ‘alongside live lobsters.’” Nvidia believes the focus should be on out-innovating competitors rather than relying on restrictive policies. The Impact of Export Controls on Companies Like Nvidia For a company with a significant global footprint like Nvidia , export restrictions have a direct and substantial financial impact. The company has openly stated that a new licensing requirement specifically for its H20 AI chips intended for sale in China could cost them an estimated $5.5 billion in the first quarter of their 2026 fiscal year alone. This figure underscores the importance of the Chinese market for Nvidia’s revenue streams and highlights the financial stakes involved in these policy decisions. The debate isn’t just about revenue; it’s also about market dynamics and the future of the US China tech rivalry. While the US government aims to slow down China’s AI progress, companies like Nvidia worry that being shut out of a major market could hinder their own ability to invest in R&D and maintain their technological edge in the long run. It’s a delicate balance between national security interests and commercial viability. What Does Anthropic ‘s Support Signify? Anthropic ‘s public support for stricter export controls suggests a belief that the potential risks associated with uncontrolled AI diffusion outweigh the economic considerations. As a company focused on AI safety and alignment, their position aligns with a perspective that prioritizes responsible development and control over widespread access, especially to potential strategic competitors. This divergence in opinion between two major players in the AI space — one a hardware powerhouse (Nvidia) and the other a leading AI model developer (Anthropic) — illustrates the broader tension within the tech industry regarding the balance between open innovation, global markets, and national security concerns in the age of advanced AI. Concluding Thoughts on the Nvidia vs. Anthropic Debate The public disagreement between Nvidia and Anthropic over export controls on AI chips is more than just corporate squabbling; it’s a window into the high-stakes policy debates shaping the future of technology and international relations, particularly the dynamic US China tech landscape. As the May 15th deadline for the new restrictions approaches, the industry will be closely watching how these policies are implemented and what their long-term effects will be on innovation, market access, and the global race for AI dominance. This conflict underscores that even within the cutting-edge field of AI, fundamental disagreements exist on the best path forward.

The transfer, flagged by blockchain monitoring service Whale Alert on May 2, initially sparked speculation of a large-scale dump.

The average directional index, which gauges trend strength, is low at just 12.7, and the relative strength index is neutral at 53. Lack of conviction among traders is indicated by oscillators such as the moving average convergence divergence and Stochastic, which are either neutral or slightly bullish. XRP may see a push toward the $2.50 region if bulls can break above the $2.30 resistance level. However, a decline toward $2.05 or even $2.00 is more likely if the price falls below $2.16 and is unable to hold the 50-day EMA. The flat volume indicates that traders are holding off on making a move until they receive a clearer signal. Beyond the chart, XRP is facing some big-picture questions.

Have you ever wondered what backs the world’s largest stablecoin, Tether (USDT)? Well, the company recently pulled back the curtain a bit, revealing a staggering figure: their Tether Bitcoin holdings now stand at a whopping $7.6 billion! This isn’t just a number; it’s a significant insight into the financial muscle behind USDT and its potential influence on the broader Stablecoin market and Crypto assets landscape. Understanding Tether’s Massive Bitcoin Holdings Tether Operations Limited, the issuer of USDT, recently shared details about its reserves, and the headline figure is certainly eye-catching. They reported holding approximately $7.6 billion worth of Bitcoin as part of their extensive reserve portfolio. This positions Tether as one of the largest known corporate holders of Bitcoin globally, a fact that has significant implications for both the company and the Bitcoin news cycle. But what exactly does this mean? For a stablecoin issuer like Tether, holding reserves is fundamental to maintaining the peg of its token (USDT) to the US dollar. These reserves are essentially assets that the company holds to match the value of the USDT tokens in circulation. When you see a figure like $7.6 billion in Bitcoin within those reserves, it highlights a strategic decision by Tether to include volatile, albeit potentially high-performing, Crypto assets alongside more traditional holdings like cash, cash equivalents, and other investments. This substantial allocation to Bitcoin underscores Tether’s confidence in the cryptocurrency as a store of value and potentially a growth asset within its diverse reserve structure. It’s a move that reflects the growing institutional acceptance of Bitcoin, even from entities whose primary function is to provide stability. A Closer Look at Tether’s Balance Sheet The report didn’t just stop at the Bitcoin figure. It provided a broader snapshot of Tether’s financial health. The report stated that Tether’s total assets have a considerable value of $149.2 billion. On the other side of the ledger, its liabilities, which primarily represent the amount of USDT tokens currently in circulation, weighed in at $143.6 billion. This balance sheet structure is crucial for a stablecoin. The difference between total assets and total liabilities represents Tether’s equity or surplus. In this case, a surplus of approximately $5.6 billion ($149.2B – $143.6B) indicates that Tether holds more assets than are needed to cover its liabilities (the outstanding USDT). This surplus acts as a buffer, providing an extra layer of security and stability for USDT holders. While the report highlighted the Tether Bitcoin holdings , Tether’s reserves are typically diversified across various asset classes. A simplified view of a stablecoin reserve portfolio often includes: Cash and cash equivalents (like U.S. Treasury bills) Corporate bonds Secured loans Other investments, including cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and gold The specific breakdown of the *entire* $149.2 billion in assets is complex and subject to regular attestation reports, but the explicit mention of $7.6 billion in Bitcoin gives us a clear view of one significant component of their Crypto assets . Why Does Tether Hold So Much Bitcoin? It might seem counterintuitive for a stablecoin, designed for stability, to hold a volatile asset like Bitcoin. However, there are several strategic reasons why Tether likely includes significant Tether Bitcoin holdings in its reserves: Diversification: While cash and short-term debt are primary components, diversifying into other asset classes can help manage risk and potentially enhance overall portfolio returns. Bitcoin offers diversification away from traditional financial instruments. Potential for Appreciation: Bitcoin has historically shown significant growth potential. Including it in reserves allows Tether to potentially increase its asset base beyond just the value of outstanding USDT, contributing to the equity buffer. Industry Alignment: As a major player in the crypto ecosystem, holding Bitcoin aligns Tether with the core asset of the industry. It demonstrates confidence in the future of digital currencies beyond stablecoins. Store of Value: Many proponents view Bitcoin as a digital store of value, similar to gold. Holding it can be seen as a way to preserve wealth over the long term. This strategy isn’t without its critics, primarily due to Bitcoin’s price volatility. A significant downturn in the Bitcoin market could theoretically impact the value of Tether’s reserves. However, the substantial equity buffer ($5.6 billion) and the diversification across other, less volatile assets are intended to mitigate this risk. How Do Tether’s Holdings Impact the Stablecoin Market and Beyond? Tether’s position as the dominant force in the Stablecoin market means its actions and financial health have ripple effects across the entire crypto ecosystem. Here’s how their large Tether Bitcoin holdings and overall balance sheet can influence things: Market Confidence: A healthy balance sheet with assets exceeding liabilities (a positive equity buffer) instills confidence in USDT holders. This is crucial for maintaining the stablecoin’s peg and preventing bank-run scenarios. Bitcoin Price Influence: While Tether doesn’t constantly buy or sell large amounts, being a known significant holder adds to the overall demand side for Bitcoin. Any future large-scale buying or selling by Tether could potentially impact Bitcoin’s price, making it a key factor in Bitcoin news . Benchmarking for Other Stablecoins: Tether’s reserve composition and transparency (or lack thereof, depending on the report type) often set a de facto standard or point of comparison for other stablecoin issuers. This influences practices across the Stablecoin market . Regulatory Scrutiny: The size and composition of Tether’s reserves, particularly the inclusion of volatile Crypto assets like Bitcoin, are often subjects of regulatory interest and discussion globally. Increased scrutiny can impact Tether’s operations and the broader market. It’s clear that Tether isn’t just a stablecoin issuer; its massive asset base, including its substantial Bitcoin stash, makes it a major financial entity within the digital asset space, with connections influencing both the stablecoin and the volatile cryptocurrency markets. Navigating the Transparency Debate: Why Does it Matter? For years, Tether has faced questions and scrutiny regarding the exact composition and verification of its reserves. While they regularly publish attestations (reports verifying their assets and liabilities at a specific point in time), these are not full audits and have sometimes lacked granular detail. The recent report explicitly mentioning the $7.6 billion in Tether Bitcoin holdings is a step towards greater transparency, providing concrete numbers for specific asset classes. However, the ongoing debate about the full breakdown of the remaining ~$140 billion in assets and the independent verification process remains a key point of discussion in Bitcoin news and the broader crypto community. Why is transparency so important for a stablecoin? Importance of Transparency Impact on Users & Market Builds Trust & Confidence Users are more confident that their USDT can be redeemed 1:1 for USD. Ensures Stability Verifiable reserves confirm the stablecoin is fully backed, reducing systemic risk in the Stablecoin market . Informs Regulatory Bodies Clear reporting helps regulators understand the risks and structure of major Crypto assets and stablecoins. Provides Market Clarity Knowing reserve composition helps analysts and investors understand potential market impacts (e.g., if reserves include volatile assets). Increased transparency benefits everyone in the ecosystem by providing a clearer picture of the financial health and backing of the most widely used stablecoin. Actionable Insights for Crypto Users What does this information about Tether Bitcoin holdings and their balance sheet mean for you, the everyday crypto user or investor? USDT Stability: The reported surplus of assets over liabilities ($5.6 billion) is a positive sign for the stability of USDT. It suggests a healthy buffer against potential market shocks, including volatility in their Tether Bitcoin holdings . Market Context: Understand that Tether is a significant player. Their reserve strategy, including their large Bitcoin allocation, is a factor in the broader market dynamics. Keep an eye on major announcements from Tether as part of your Bitcoin news consumption. Diversification is Key: Just as Tether diversifies its reserves, individual investors should consider diversifying their own crypto portfolios rather than putting all their funds into a single asset or stablecoin. Stay Informed: Continue to follow reports and analyses on stablecoin reserves and regulatory developments. This knowledge is crucial for navigating the Stablecoin market safely. While Tether’s large Bitcoin holding is notable, it’s just one piece of a much larger and more complex financial structure. Understanding the full picture, including the total assets, liabilities, and the ongoing efforts (or challenges) in transparency, is key. Conclusion: Tether’s Bitcoin Stash – A Sign of Confidence and Influence Tether’s revelation of holding $7.6 billion worth of Bitcoin is more than just an interesting statistic; it’s a powerful statement about the increasing integration of traditional financial concepts (like reserves and balance sheets) with the volatile world of cryptocurrencies. As the issuer of the dominant stablecoin, USDT, Tether’s financial health and reserve composition are critically important for the stability of the entire Stablecoin market and influence perceptions of Crypto assets globally. The reported $149.2 billion in assets against $143.6 billion in liabilities paints a picture of a well-collateralized stablecoin, backed by a significant equity buffer. The inclusion of a substantial amount of Tether Bitcoin holdings reflects a strategic choice to diversify and potentially benefit from the upside of the leading cryptocurrency, while also introducing the inherent volatility risk that must be managed. As the crypto market matures, transparency surrounding major entities like Tether will remain paramount. While steps have been taken, continued clarity on the full reserve breakdown will further build trust and solidify the foundation of the digital asset ecosystem. For now, Tether’s massive Bitcoin stash stands as a testament to Bitcoin’s growing role and Tether’s significant influence within the crypto world.

Early Friday, Asian markets caught fire. The Australian dollar rose hard, up 0.5% to $0.6412. New Zealand’s kiwi moved too, gaining 0.4% to $0.5932. Both are risk currencies that bounce with China news, and both jumped after the offshore yuan surged to 7.2519 against the dollar, its strongest level since April 4. Traders are reacting to fresh signs that the two global powers may resume negotiations. A late Thursday broadcast from Chinese state media was read as a green light from Beijing. Then Marco Rubio, the U.S. Secretary of State, told Fox News, “Talks with China will come up soon.” These hints landed after weeks of volatility triggered by President Donald Trump’s tariffs, which gutted market confidence and sent asset prices flying in all directions. Yuan climbs, yen tanks, dollar keeps going Alvin Tan, a currency analyst in Singapore, reportedly said: “The dollar was hit so badly in the immediate aftermath of the tariffs, so now in the broad picture there’s a normalisation in the market. The market is keeping one eye on the economic situation, but the other eye is looking for positive developments in China.” That’s where the optimism is coming from, less about what’s happening, more about what could. The greenback still looks solid for the week. It fell 0.2% on Friday, but is still headed for a 0.3% weekly gain. The dollar index stayed strong, even as trade volume thinned out due to holidays. Against the yen, the dollar climbed to 145.91—the highest since April 10—before pulling back to 145.17. Japan’s central bank stayed frozen on rates and slashed growth forecasts, blaming uncertainty from U.S. trade policy. That move hit the yen, which crumbled Thursday. It also suggested Tokyo won’t hike rates again anytime soon until it sees where all this U.S.-China drama lands. Meanwhile, China’s markets stayed shut for a long holiday, but the currency moves elsewhere made it clear where sentiment is headed. Investors are ready to chase risk again, as long as Washington and Beijing stop threatening to blow up trade every other day. Wall Street jumps on trade buzz, tech earnings On Thursday night, S&P 500 futures rose 0.68% after China said it’s weighing trade talks. The Dow futures popped 0.82%, up 337 points. Nasdaq 100 futures rose 0.32%. Markets took the comments as a break from weeks of stress over tariffs, recession talk, and tech weakness. U.S. shares also moved during the day session. The Nasdaq Composite surged 1.5%, erasing all its losses since April 2, the same day Trump started the mess with his “reciprocal” tariffs comment. The S&P 500 gained 0.6%, and the Dow added 0.2%. Both indexes are on an eight-day winning streak. The rally has been helped by a tech sector that’s trying to shake off shaky earnings. That shake-up continued on Thursday. Apple sank 4% in after-hours trading after it missed expectations for revenue from its Services division. It also warned it’s bracing for $900 million in extra costs this quarter, tied to—you guessed it—tariffs. Amazon dropped 2% after putting out weak guidance and blaming “tariffs and trade policies” for the miss. Both firms are part of the so-called “Magnificent Seven,” and their results added more fuel to the tariff fire. Still, not all the earnings news was trash. About two-thirds of S&P 500 companies have reported so far, and 76% have beat earnings forecasts, according to FactSet. That stat helped carry stocks up earlier in the week. Results from Meta and Microsoft in particular gave bulls some energy, and traders went back to betting on AI again. On the economic side, a manufacturing report landed better than feared. It still showed contraction, but the data was less ugly than expected. That helped put a floor under stocks and pushed Treasury yields up slightly. Add in the weaker yen and stronger yuan, and it was enough to get people buying again. Cryptopolitan Academy: Want to grow your money in 2025? Learn how to do it with DeFi in our upcoming webclass.

44059092,https://timestabloid.com/?p=65802,1746173260,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/67/default.png,XRP is positioned to serve as the invisible engine behind global value exchange,https://timestabloid.com/expert-says-people-will-use-xrp-without-even-knowing-it-heres-why/,"Crypto Researcher SMQKE recently published a detailed commentary explaining how the Ripple protocol is designed to serve as an invisible infrastructure for global value transfer, comparing its role to the Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP) in email communication. SMQKE’s post references a document that outlines Ripple’s technical and functional foundations, emphasizing its architecture, purpose, and long-term vision in transforming international finance. The central thesis of SMQKE’s tweet is that XRP will be used by people without their direct awareness, owing to the way Ripple’s protocol operates in the background. The document cited affirms this by stating, “customers of financial institutions do not need to know anything about Ripple or its protocol.” According to the analysis, the Ripple protocol is positioned to operate behind the scenes, enabling real-time, cross-border settlement without requiring end users to interact with or even understand the system, facilitating the transaction. A Universal Protocol for Value Transfer Ripple is described as a universal Internet protocol founded in 2012, aimed at facilitating fast and cost-efficient payments across borders. The document outlines that Ripple allows the transfer of any form of value, including fiat currencies, gold, digital assets, securities, commodities like barrels of oil, and even non-monetary units like hours of electricity and services. SMQKE highlights that this wide range of transferable value sets Ripple apart from traditional financial messaging systems. The SMTP Analogy and Background Functionality The document further asserts that Ripple’s technology operates similarly to SMTP, which allows different email platforms (such as Hotmail or Yahoo) to communicate regardless of the software in use. In the same fashion, Ripple enables disparate financial systems to interact and settle payments without relying on a centralized payment platform. SMQKE points to this analogy to demonstrate how Ripple is not meant to be visible to the user—it simply functions as the transport layer for financial value, just as SMTP is for email. Positioning XRP in the Financial Architecture According to the source, Ripple positions itself not as a payment system or a direct competitor to banks but as a backbone for a new financial architecture. It aims to offer banks and financial institutions a settlement layer that operates independently of the traditional correspondent banking framework. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Ripple Labs, the entity responsible for the protocol, has developed XRP as a native digital asset that can bridge any two currencies or assets, making it easier for institutions to settle obligations instantly and efficiently. An Invisible Engine for Institutions and End Users The network underpinning Ripple is decentralized and composed of servers powering the open-source protocol. The system can transfer virtual liabilities anywhere in the world in approximately six seconds. These liabilities represent fiat or digital currencies, tangible goods, or other value units. SMQKE emphasizes that XRP is uniquely suited for this role as it can serve as a liquidity bridge between assets, allowing seamless exchange without needing pre-funded accounts. Ripple’s design allows it to silently integrate into financial systems. Financial institutions can act as gateways for entering and exiting the network, while customers interacting with their banks or service providers remain unaware that Ripple is enabling their transactions. SMQKE sees this operational invisibility as a critical factor in Ripple’s ability to scale globally, allowing it to function as a foundational infrastructure layer without disrupting front-end user experiences. The conclusion from SMQKE’s commentary is clear: Ripple, through its protocol and XRP, is built to support a reimagined financial system where speed, interoperability, and decentralization are paramount. Its role is to provide the backend connectivity that empowers banks and institutions to transfer value quickly and reliably, without requiring consumer participation or knowledge of the underlying technology.

Over 2.5 hours, they outlined an ambitious $84 billion financing roadmap, combining equity (ATM) and fixed income instruments to both de-risk and leverage the company’s Bitcoin-heavy balance sheet . A key part of this strategy involves new products like Strike and Strife , innovative fixed-income instruments that are perpetual and Bitcoin-backed. Strife, in particular, is structured for long-term holders, offering a 10% dividend with low volatility and no equity dilution, making it highly attractive for traditional investors wary of crypto. Slides from the presentation highlighted why MicroStrategy trades at a premium to Bitcoin NAV—thanks to brand strength, financial engineering, and an expanding ecosystem of derivative products. The team also introduced a Bitcoin credit rating model to show how overcollateralization reduces default risk, pushing these instruments into ""investment-grade"" territory under various BTC price and volatility scenarios. If Bitcoin grows at even 10–30% annually, these instruments—currently undervalued—may offer high yield with minimal risk. Compared to high-risk traditional debt (like PG&E's), MicroStrategy's offerings are positioned as some of the safest, best-yielding instruments in the market , provided the market accepts Bitcoin’s long-term value proposition.

44060926,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=154505,1746177046,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Historic North Carolina Senate Approves Strategic Bitcoin Reserve Bill,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/north-carolina-bitcoin-reserve/,"A significant development is unfolding in the United States, specifically concerning North Carolina Bitcoin policy. According to reports, the North Carolina Senate has taken a noteworthy step by approving a bill aimed at establishing a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve for the state. This move, initially highlighted by Watcher Guru on X, signals a growing interest among state-level governments in exploring the potential role of digital assets within their financial strategies. What is a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve and Why Now? At its core, a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve would involve a state government holding a certain amount of Bitcoin as part of its treasury assets. This isn’t entirely unprecedented globally, but it would be a pioneering step for a U.S. state. The motivations behind such a move can be multifaceted, ranging from hedging against inflation and currency devaluation to positioning the state as forward-thinking in the digital economy and potentially attracting innovation and investment in the blockchain and cryptocurrency sectors. The timing of this Bitcoin legislation is interesting, coming at a time when Bitcoin’s price has seen significant volatility but also increased institutional and retail adoption. States, like individuals and corporations, are looking for ways to diversify assets and potentially secure long-term value in an uncertain economic climate. Establishing Cryptocurrency reserves , starting with Bitcoin, could be seen as a modern approach to treasury management. Potential Benefits of North Carolina’s Strategic Bitcoin Reserve The proponents of this bill likely see several advantages for North Carolina. While the specifics of the bill’s implementation and the proposed size of the reserve are crucial details yet to be fully publicized or debated, the general benefits often cited for holding Bitcoin as a reserve asset include: Inflation Hedge: Bitcoin’s fixed supply is often seen as a hedge against the inflationary pressures that can erode the purchasing power of fiat currencies. Asset Diversification: Adding a non-correlated asset like Bitcoin to a traditional portfolio of stocks, bonds, and fiat can help reduce overall portfolio risk. Potential for Appreciation: Despite volatility, Bitcoin has shown significant long-term growth potential, offering the possibility of increasing state assets. Attracting Innovation: A state embracing digital assets could signal a friendly environment for crypto and blockchain companies, potentially fostering job creation and economic growth. Setting a Precedent: North Carolina could become a leader in State Bitcoin adoption , potentially influencing other states and even federal policy. These potential benefits paint a picture of a state looking to future-proof its finances and embrace emerging technologies. Challenges and Considerations for Cryptocurrency Reserves However, establishing Cryptocurrency reserves is not without its challenges and risks. The volatility of Bitcoin is a primary concern. A reserve could see significant fluctuations in value, potentially leading to public scrutiny and financial uncertainty if not managed carefully. Other considerations include: Security: Storing digital assets securely requires specialized expertise and robust cybersecurity measures to protect against hacks and theft. Regulatory Uncertainty: The regulatory landscape for cryptocurrencies in the U.S. is still evolving, which could impact the legal and operational aspects of managing a state reserve. Public Perception: There might be public and political skepticism regarding the use of taxpayer money to acquire volatile digital assets. Management Complexity: Managing a Bitcoin reserve requires technical knowledge and infrastructure for acquisition, storage, and potential future liquidation. Successfully navigating these challenges will be critical for the feasibility and long-term success of North Carolina’s potential Strategic Bitcoin Reserve . Comparing North Carolina’s Move to Other State Bitcoin Adoption Efforts While North Carolina appears to be the first U.S. state Senate to pass a bill specifically for a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve , other states have explored or enacted legislation related to cryptocurrency in different capacities. Some have focused on: Creating frameworks for cryptocurrency businesses. Allowing state agencies to accept cryptocurrency for payments. Studying blockchain technology for various applications. North Carolina’s approach of potentially holding Bitcoin directly as a reserve asset represents a more direct form of State Bitcoin adoption than seen in most other U.S. states to date. This could position North Carolina at the forefront of this particular aspect of integrating digital assets into public finance. What’s Next for This Bitcoin Legislation? The bill’s approval by the North Carolina Senate is a significant step, but it is not the final one. The legislative process typically requires passage by the House of Representatives as well, followed by the Governor’s signature to become law. The journey of this Bitcoin legislation through the remaining stages will be closely watched by the cryptocurrency community and other states considering similar moves. The specifics of the bill, including funding sources for the reserve, the amount of Bitcoin to be acquired, storage methods, and management protocols, will be key details that emerge as the bill progresses. Public debate and expert input will likely play a role in shaping the final form of this potentially landmark legislation for North Carolina Bitcoin policy. Implications for North Carolina and the Broader Crypto Landscape If this bill becomes law, it could have several implications. For North Carolina residents, it represents the state exploring innovative financial strategies, though the direct impact on individuals might not be immediate. For the broader cryptocurrency landscape, it serves as another signal of increasing mainstream acceptance and exploration of digital assets beyond individual investment, moving into governmental treasury management. This development adds to the narrative of growing interest in Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies at various levels of government and finance, suggesting a potential long-term trend towards integrating these assets into traditional financial systems. The success or challenges faced by North Carolina could serve as a case study for other jurisdictions considering similar steps towards establishing their own Strategic Bitcoin Reserve or other forms of State Bitcoin adoption . Conclusion: A Bold Step Towards Digital Asset Integration The North Carolina Senate’s approval of a bill to create a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve is a bold and potentially historic move. It highlights a growing willingness among state governments to seriously consider the role of digital assets like Bitcoin in their financial futures. While challenges related to volatility, security, and regulation remain, the potential benefits of asset diversification, inflation hedging, and fostering technological innovation are compelling drivers. As this Bitcoin legislation moves forward, its progress will be closely monitored as a key indicator of evolving attitudes towards Cryptocurrency reserves and State Bitcoin adoption in the United States.

Shiba Inu’s Shibarium blasted through a fresh milestone, signaling strong user engagement, though SHIB’s price remains in the red on a weekly scale. Dogecoin (DOGE) is holding around $0.18, with analysts eyeing a breakout in the following days. What Could Be Next for PI? PI started May on the right foot, witnessing a solid daily price increase as it temporarily crossed $0.60. The revival has infused enthusiasm across the community, with some analysts predicting additional gains in the near future . One user on the social media platform X pointed out that PI has been trading sideways between $0.50 and $0.70 lately, calling this range “a good accumulation zone.” That said, they believe a rally is imminent, targeting a move up to $5. MOON JEFF, a regular commentator on PI, echoed this view. Additionally, Pi News (an X account presenting news related to Pi Network) suggested the asset’s valuation “can go beyond your imagination anytime.” They based this on the unpredictable nature of crypto markets, referencing ALPACA’s recent price explosion of over 2,000% in just a week, though it crashed just as quickly. Meanwhile, the past several hours have offered another mild correction for PI, which dipped under the $0.60 mark again. Shibarium’s Progress Shiba Inu’s layer-2 scaling solution remains a trending topic in the crypto space, frequently surpassing different milestones. A month ago, the number of transactions processed on Shibarium exceeded one billion. Just a few days ago, the total number of wallet addresses that have interacted with the protocol since its launch in August 2021 surged past 200 million. Increased activity on Shibarium signals enhanced user engagement within the Shiba Inu ecosystem, and a ccording to some industry participants, further advancement of the L2 blockchain solution could lead to a rally for the meme coin. Despite the recent milestone, SHIB remains in the red on a weekly scale, currently trading at roughly $0.00001346 (per CoinGecko’s data). Incoming Pump for DOGE? Let’s now take a closer look at Shiba Inu’s biggest rival – Dogecoin (DOGE). The biggest meme coin, with a market capitalization of almost $27 billion, saw its price jump by 16% in the past two weeks, and as of this writing, it’s hovering around $0.18. Some analysts believe there is much more room for growth in the short and medium term. The X user Trader Tardigrade assumed that DOGE had completed a breakout when crossing $0.175, forecasting an ascent beyond $0.20 in the following days. CryptoBullet and Crypto Patel were also bullish. The former envisioned a cycle top of over $3.20 by the end of the year, while the latter set a whopping target of $32. The double-digit projection seems highly unlikely at this stage, as it would require Dogecoin’s market cap to skyrocket above the ridiculous $4 trillion.

The analyst, pseudonymously known as Credible Crypto, tells his 467,000 subscribers on the social media platform X that it is “only logical” for the native token of the DeFi altcoin Curve DAO ( CRV ) to hit a new all-time high against Bitcoin ( BTC ) before the end of the cycle. According to the pseudonymous analyst and trader, CRV could surge by around 1,840% from the current level to reach a price of 0.00015 BTC. CRV is trading at 0.00000773 BTC ($0.739) at time of writing. Credible Crypto says his bullish thesis for the Ethereum-based DeFi project focused on the trading of stablecoins is primarily informed by the improvement in the fundamentals since CRV last hit an all-time high against Bitcoin in 2021. “Well, aside from the technicals (which look fantastic), since the last all-time high on CRV/BTC: – Yearly inflation of CRV has dropped from approximately 20% down to 4%. – Total amount of CRV locked (effectively burned) has increased to approximately 40% of ALL circulating CRV. – [Total] Stablecoin market cap has increased by approximately $70 billion and climbing ($170 billion [then] vs $240 billion [now]). – Curve launched their own native stablecoin crvUSD that currently sits at $200 million market cap. – Curve launched their own borrowing/lending platform (like AAVE) that currently sits at $140 million in total value locked. – Curve launched their own automated market maker (LLAMMA) to allow for novel “soft liquidations” on their lending platform mentioned above. – Number of Curve developers has nearly doubled and developer commits are at all-time highs.” The widely followed analyst also says it is not “unreasonable or illogical” for the Curve DAO/US dollar pair to reach double-digit price levels in the current cycle. “Not sure what price BTC will be at when this happens but at $100,000 BTC, a new all-time high on the CRV/BTC ratio puts CRV at $15+.” Bitcoin is trading at $96,597 at time of writing.

A significant development comes from FutureHouse, a nonprofit backed by Eric Schmidt, which has just unveiled its initial suite of powerful AI tools aimed squarely at accelerating scientific discovery. This move signals a growing trend: the race to build an ‘AI scientist’ capable of revolutionizing how research is conducted. For those interested in the intersection of technology and progress, understanding the potential and limitations of FutureHouse AI in this critical domain is key. What AI Tools Has FutureHouse Launched? FutureHouse’s ambitious goal is to create a fully capable AI scientist within the next ten years. Their first major step is the release of a new platform and API, providing researchers with AI-powered capabilities designed to support various stages of scientific work. They aren’t alone in this pursuit; numerous startups, often backed by substantial venture capital, and major tech companies like Google, OpenAI, and Anthropic are also heavily invested in developing AI for science applications. These industry leaders believe AI can significantly speed up scientific progress, particularly in complex areas like medicine. FutureHouse has launched four distinct AI tools, each designed for specific scientific tasks: Crow: Focuses on searching scientific literature and providing answers to questions based on its findings. Falcon: Offers deeper literature searches, extending its reach into specialized scientific databases. Owl: Helps researchers identify previous work and existing knowledge within a given subject area. Phoenix: Provides assistance specifically for planning chemistry experiments, utilizing relevant scientific tools. According to FutureHouse, these tools collectively represent the first publicly available components of their envisioned AI Scientist . Can AI Truly Accelerate Scientific Discovery? FutureHouse makes bold claims about the capabilities of their newly released tools. According to the organization, these AI agents can perform a wide range of scientific tasks more effectively than humans. They emphasize that by ‘chaining’ these agents together, they have already seen promising results in accelerating biological discovery. A key differentiator FutureHouse highlights is their AI’s access to a vast collection of high-quality, open-access scientific papers and specialized tools. They also stress the tools’ transparent reasoning process and a multi-stage approach that allows for in-depth consideration of source material. The core idea is that this interconnected system of Scientific Discovery AI agents can dramatically increase the pace of research and innovation. While the vision of a full ‘AI scientist’ is still distant, there are areas where AI Tools for Research are already showing promise or are expected to be beneficial. AI is particularly well-suited for tasks involving the processing and analysis of vast datasets, sifting through extensive literature, and identifying patterns that might be missed by human researchers. It can be highly valuable in initial exploratory phases, such as narrowing down a large number of potential candidates (like drug compounds or materials) for further investigation. This capability addresses a significant bottleneck in many research fields. What Are the Challenges Facing AI in Research? Despite the exciting potential, the path to a truly reliable AI scientist is fraught with challenges. Many researchers remain skeptical about the current utility of AI in guiding the core scientific process, citing its unreliability and tendency to ‘hallucinate’ or produce inaccurate information. A major hurdle is the AI’s difficulty in anticipating the countless confounding factors inherent in real-world experiments. Furthermore, achieving a genuine scientific breakthrough often requires creative, ‘out-of-the-box’ thinking, a capability AI has yet to demonstrate consistently. Past attempts at using AI for science have sometimes yielded underwhelming results. For example, Google’s GNoME project in 2023 claimed the AI helped synthesize new materials, but subsequent analysis found none were actually novel. The technical limitations and risks associated with AI make scientists cautious, as even well-designed studies could be compromised by AI errors, particularly in tasks requiring high precision. FutureHouse itself acknowledges these challenges, noting that their AI tools , specifically Phoenix, may make mistakes. How is FutureHouse Addressing These Challenges? FutureHouse recognizes that the AI scientist is not a finished product. They are releasing their tools now ‘in the spirit of rapid iteration,’ actively seeking feedback from the scientific community as researchers begin using the platform. This approach allows for continuous improvement and refinement based on real-world application and user experience. It highlights that the development of advanced AI for science is an ongoing, collaborative process, acknowledging the current limitations of AI Tools for Research while striving for future advancements. The launch of FutureHouse’s AI platform and tools marks a significant step in the ambitious quest to build an AI scientist . While the vision of AI autonomously conducting groundbreaking research is still on the horizon, these tools represent a tangible effort to augment human researchers, potentially accelerating parts of the discovery process. The challenges, particularly around reliability and true creative problem-solving, are substantial and acknowledged by FutureHouse. However, by providing researchers with specialized AI tools and adopting an iterative development model, FutureHouse is contributing to the evolution of AI for science , pushing the boundaries of what’s possible in scientific exploration and the pursuit of Scientific Discovery AI .

The applicant posed as an engineer and was caught mid-interview after Kraken’s security teams ran a full investigation into the person’s identity and digital trail. The company said the hiring process became an intelligence operation the moment red flags started to show. According to Kraken, the job application attempt came during a routine recruitment process. However, the situation turned serious when the candidate gave a name different from the one on their resume during the first call and then quickly corrected it. The person’s voice also shifted multiple times during the interview, leading recruiters to believe someone else might’ve been coaching them live. Kraken uses breach data and email tracing to expose the operation The applicant had submitted an email that matched one previously flagged by crypto industry contacts who had warned that North Korea’s hacker units were actively applying to companies in the sector. After confirming the match, Kraken’s internal Red Team launched a deeper investigation using OSINT techniques to analyze breach records and data tied to the email account. That search uncovered a broader network of fake identities. The individual behind the application had created multiple aliases, some of which had already been hired at other companies. The team found work emails tied to these fake names. One of them belonged to someone on an international sanctions list as a known foreign agent. The fake resume was connected to a GitHub account with a breached email, and the submitted ID appeared altered. The candidate used remote colocated Mac desktops and routed all traffic through a VPN — a setup designed to hide their real location. Kraken said the ID likely came from a two-year-old identity theft case. At that point, the security team had enough evidence to consider the applicant part of a state-level infiltration campaign — not a solo scammer. Kraken runs a full sting operation through interview process Instead of cutting off communication, Kraken’s recruitment and security teams pushed forward with the process. The applicant was moved through various rounds, including infosec skill assessments and identity verifications. The final interview involved Kraken’s Chief Security Officer Nick Percoco, who met the candidate with a group of other staff members for what the company labeled a “chemistry interview.” During that call, Nick and his team inserted verification prompts into the conversation. They asked the applicant to confirm their location, show a government ID, and name local restaurants in the city they claimed to live in. The applicant couldn’t keep up. They hesitated, gave unclear answers, and failed basic questions about their own alleged hometown. The performance collapsed under pressure, revealing that the applicant had no real knowledge of the location they claimed or the identity they were using. At the end of the interview, Kraken said it was clear this wasn’t a real applicant. It was a foreign-backed imposter using a fake identity to try to gain insider access to the crypto company. Nick confirmed the incident in a public statement, saying: “Don’t trust, verify. This core crypto principle is more relevant than ever in the digital age. State-sponsored attacks aren’t just a crypto or U.S. corporate issue – they’re a global threat. Any individual or business handling value is a target, and resilience starts with operationally preparing to withstand these types of attacks.” Kraken said they were releasing the full details of the case to warn other crypto firms that traditional hiring pipelines are now being used as infiltration tools by foreign governments. The exchange also noted that North Korea-linked hackers had stolen over $650 million from crypto firms in 2024, with job application schemes becoming a new trend.

The event draws more than 15,000 global Web3 leaders, investors, developers, and policymakers to the heart of the Middle East’s burgeoning digital economy. As the MENA region solidifies its status as a strategic launchpad for blockchain and digital finance, Interlace is leveraging Token2049 to highlight its global ambitions and regional integration efforts. Through a combination of keynote speeches, panel participation, side events, and interactive showcases, the company will spotlight its technological breakthroughs, regulatory strategies, and innovative Web3 solutions designed to advance financial inclusion and digital infrastructure. Token2049 has cemented its position as the premier global platform for blockchain dialogue and innovation. With MENA emerging as a magnet for crypto and fintech enterprises—thanks to its progressive regulatory framework and strong investor base —the event provides fertile ground for companies like Interlace to scale their operations in high-growth markets. Driving Web3 Compliance and Strategy in the Middle East Michael Wu, Founder and CEO of Interlace, was recently invited to speak at the event Mastering Web3 Finance and Compliance: Blockchain & Beyond, where he joined a panel discussion exploring regulatory frameworks and emerging trends in the Middle East’s Web3 ecosystem. Drawing on Interlace’s extensive global experience, Wu provided a deep dive into the region’s compliance landscape. He emphasized the UAE’s regulatory efficiency as a strategic advantage for Web3 companies, stating: “In MENA, it takes only a few months to obtain a Virtual Asset Service Provider (VASP) license, whereas the same process can take up to two years in Singapore. In the United States, conflicting federal and state regulations create persistent uncertainty for businesses.” This favorable regulatory environment, he noted, has enabled Interlace to accelerate its expansion into the Middle Eastern market. Wu also outlined Interlace’s proactive compliance strategy, highlighting early regulatory investment as a foundation for building long-term competitive advantages. “We’ve secured key licenses—including MSB (Money Services Business), MSO (Money Service Operator), and VASP—across major markets such as Hong Kong, the U.S., and Europe,” he shared. He stressed the importance of integrating technology with compliance, citing the use of biometric solutions to streamline Know Your Customer (KYC) procedures. This approach not only ensures regulatory adherence but also enhances user accessibility. “Compliance is not a cost,” Wu asserted. “It’s the foundation of brand trust. For institutional partners and investors, regulatory compliance is non-negotiable—and critical for sustainable growth.” Addressing the convergence of traditional finance and Web3, Wu presented Interlace’s multi-license model as a blueprint for cross-border innovation. “Our crypto payment card enables seamless interoperability between on-chain digital assets and off-chain consumer transactions,” he explained. “This functionality requires a high degree of cross-jurisdictional compliance.” Wu concluded by sharing that Interlace is actively expanding its footprint in the Middle East, bringing its regulatory expertise and compliance technology to support the region’s rapidly evolving blockchain infrastructure. Unveiling Innovation at Premier Side Events Beyond the main conference, Interlace will engage audiences at high-profile side events including 1001 Crypto Nights, Gilded Mirage, and the Hack Seasons Conferencei . These gatherings delve into themes such as the convergence of legacy finance with decentralized protocols and the region’s unique role in accelerating Web3 adoption. Interlace will showcase its Card-as-a-Service (CaaS) API solutions tailored for the PayFi sector, as well as its custom-designed physical banking cards —which double as exclusive, limited-time gift cards. These cards demonstrate real-time “on-chain to off-chain” transaction capabilities , offering attendees a tangible experience of seamless Web3-enabled payments. A Strategic Leap Toward Global and Regional Impact Interlace’s presence at Token2049 is more than a product showcase—it represents a pivotal step in the company’s global expansion and MENA market penetration . As the company deepens its engagement in the region, it aims to collaborate with local institutions to build robust, inclusive digital financial ecosystems. Wu reflected on the significance of the Middle East in shaping the future of blockchain finance: “The Middle East is rapidly evolving from an energy stronghold into a center of digital innovation. Its open regulatory approach and dynamic capital environment make it a strategic region for Web3 transformation. At Interlace, we’re committed to co-creating resilient financial infrastructure with local partners—enabling businesses and users to fully benefit from the potential of blockchain technology. We see MENA as a future global benchmark for Web3 applications.”",Press Release,EN,0,0,ASIA|BLOCKCHAIN|BUSINESS|MARKET|TECHNOLOGY,"{'name': 'Bitcoin World', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinworld,2025-05-02 09:24:37

Any sustained move above $0.00001950 would open the door to revisit the $0.000022 and $0.000024 areas. If it fails to hold above $0.00001300, a return to the $0.00001100–$0.00001080 support zone becomes likely.

Robert Breedlove, a top crypto expert, believes the real surge is yet to come. He’s pointing to three major signs that could mean a huge breakout for Bitcoin is right around the corner. Ready to find out what’s next? Let’s dive in! Miners Are Hitting Their Limits First up is the “Average Miner Cost of Production” chart, shared by Blockware. This chart measures how much it costs, on average, to mine 1 Bitcoin. Looking at the pattern, Bitcoin price rarely stays below the cost of mining for long. Every time Bitcoin fell below it before, it was the lowest point before a big price jump. It’s happened six times before, most recently in September 2024, and now, it’s flashing again. I don’t normally speculate on short-term #Bitcoin price action — but some friends of mine have provided some fascinating perspectives that I want to share.

In the last 30 days alone, they’ve added about 150,000 Bitcoin. That shows strong belief in Bitcoin’s future and means there’s less supply being sold. And when there are fewer sellers, prices usually go up. More Money Is Entering the Market The final and maybe most powerful signal is rising fiat liquidity, especially U.S. dollars. As more dollars flow into the financial system, there’s more money available to buy Bitcoin. As ETFs, Bitcoin bonds, and big companies start buying BTC, it becomes easier for money to flow in. So while things may look calm now, this quiet signal suggests a bigger Bitcoin rally could be right around the corner. As of now, Bitcoin price is trading around $96,676, reflecting a rise of 1.5% seen in the last 24 hours, with a market cap hitting $1.92 trillion.",News,EN,0,0,BTC|FIAT|MARKET|MINING|TRADING,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-05-02 09:29:42

The current phase 4 of their token allocation stands at $0.025 per token while investors have purchased more than 430 million tokens. The platform operates as a decentralized lending system which provides real-world applications while steering clear of short-lived memes projects. The structured tokenomics and innovative buyback mechanism of Mutuum Finance resembles the early Ethereum model where tokens were priced at $27 before reaching $4,800 as their peak. Investors rush to buy into the project because phase 5 will boost the token price by 20% percent. The project shows rapid growth as well as building an enormous sense of time pressure. Mutuum Finance’s Lending Innovation Mutuum Finance (MUTM) establishes its position through its two-part borrowing mechanism. Users can deposit their assets into liquidity pools to obtain growing mtTokens which represent their deposited assets and mint interest as mtETH or mtDAI over time. Loan applications require borrowers to put up assets at levels higher than the loan value to keep the ecosystem healthy. The method of using excessive collateralization helps both protect against risk and build trust within the system. Through its peer-to-peer lending system MUTM enables users to establish personal contracts for lending and borrowing all types of assets including meme coins. The provision of flexibility stands as a relatively uncommon feature in DeFi which positions Mutuum Finance (MUTM) as a powerful contender. The team dedicates its efforts to security enhancements by actively working on Certik audits for their smart contracts which will be disclosed on social platforms when the audit process completes. Presale Frenzy and Tokenomics The current phase 4 of Mutuum Finance’s (MUTM) presale features a rapid decrease in token supply. During Phase 5 the MUTM token price will increase to $0.03 while buyers who purchased it for $0.025 will achieve a 20% rise. The design of the project ensures investors will earn 140% profit at the $0.06 listing price. Experts forecast MUTM tokens will reach $3.50 during 2025 making them worth 13,900% more than their current value. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) released a holder ranking dashboard as an engagement tool which awards bonus MUTM tokens to the top 50 holders who keep their positions. The incentive system creates loyal users who exhibit higher demand levels. Buyback System Driving Demand Mutuum Finance (MUTM) directs its platform revenue stream toward buying MUTM tokens for redistribution to its stakeholders. mtToken holders benefit from the continuous token purchases made by Mutuum Finance (MUTM) which prevent price dips through investor hesitation. The self-feeding cycle operates similarly to the market conditions which lifted Ethereum to its primary position during its early growth. The real-world actual methods powering Mutuum Finance (MUTM) distinguish it from other speculative tokens through its value-deriving DeFi activities which give more lasting appeal. A $100,000 giveaway from the project provides $10,000 each to ten early investors while this initiative attracts numerous participants to join the platform. Echoes of Ethereum’s Rise At $27 Ethereum demonstrated its utility value as Mutuum Finance (MUTM) possesses the same functional strengths that could lead to exponential growth. The crypto market recognizes MUTM as its market-leading player through its innovative lending design along with strong token aspects coupled with strategic acquisition programs. The current Stage 4 entry price will not last long because Stage 5 is on track to raise the token value soon. The crowdfunding market shows interest in Ethereum-like returns through new investments.

On-chain analysts at Bubblemaps confirmed on 2 May that the platform’s token distribution aligns with its promised tokenomics, validating that 50% of the supply is earmarked for creator and holder rewards. This confirmation arrives amid rising scrutiny over the platform’s airdrop mechanics and reward claims, with sceptics concerned about the sustainability and fairness of its cult-based distribution model. BOOP hits $0.45 with $108m volume The Boop token, launched on 1 May, skyrocketed to $0.45 in less than 24 hours, up from initial lows around $0.13. According to GMGN.Ai , the 242% price rally pushed BOOP’s market cap to $350 million, with trading volume hitting $108 million. Bubblemaps’ post confirmed the token’s largest bubble allocation sits within the rewards pool, consistent with Boop.fun’s official claim that half of its token supply is reserved for creators and users who meet specific on-chain milestones. In addition to the rewards pool, 15% of the token supply has been allocated for airdrops and 10% to the Boop.fun development team. The remaining portions are yet to be detailed, prompting further calls for transparency. Bubblemaps @bubblemaps · Follow The bubble map of $BOOP matches their tokenomicsIt’s simple — just bubble it 11:02 PM · May 1, 2025 212 Reply Copy link Read 31 replies The animated blue cat logo representing BOOP has quickly become a trending symbol across crypto social media. Meme cult model raises concerns Boop.fun’s unique mechanism allows users to create meme token “cults” that can qualify for reward distributions if they hit certain milestones. Tokens that “graduate” are eligible for BOOP rewards, offering both users and influencers the chance to benefit from the platform’s transaction fees, which are redistributed to BOOP holders. To receive airdrops, users must first create a Boop.fun account through X (formerly Twitter), then launch a cult token. These tokens are initially locked for 30 days, but may unlock sooner if they gain traction. The unlocking speed is influenced by token price performance, which has raised alarms over potential manipulation. Some traders have raised concerns that this system may favour whales or insider groups who can inflate short-term value. Partnerships with tools like KaitoAI help the platform identify influencers based on their follower counts, engagement, and meme-related activity. Airdrops are then sorted into tiers, depending on these rankings. While this structure attempts to gamify meme token creation, analysts warn that its sustainability hinges on real user demand and decentralised participation. Token map validates allocations To validate whether Boop.fun was honouring its stated tokenomics, Bubblemaps released a visual on 2 May that mapped BOOP token distribution. The map showed that the largest token allocation did indeed sit with the rewards pool, followed by smaller bubbles for airdrops and team tokens. Bubblemaps posted, “The bubble map of $BOOP matches their tokenomics. It’s simple — just bubble it.” This verification is timely as community trust is vital for meme coin ecosystems, which often rely on hype cycles. While Boop.fun has promised to distribute 150 million tokens through upcoming influencer airdrops, questions remain around how transparent future distributions will be and whether all cult creators will be treated equally under the unlocking rules. With the token’s initial performance outpacing expectations, traders are closely watching how Boop.fun handles its reward mechanisms. The sustainability of its token model will likely determine whether BOOP can hold onto its current valuation or join the long list of short-lived meme coin surges.

Kraken, one of the leading cryptocurrency exchanges, has just dropped its Q1 2025 financial results, and they paint a picture of robust performance. If you’re following the crypto market or interested in the health of major exchanges, the latest report on Kraken Q1 2025 performance is certainly worth paying attention to. Kraken Q1 2025 Performance Highlights: A Closer Look at the Numbers Kraken’s first quarter of 2025 demonstrated significant upward momentum across several key metrics. The figures, as reported by Bloomberg citing Wu Blockchain, showcase a strong start to the year for the exchange. Let’s break down the core numbers: Total Revenue: Kraken saw its revenue climb to a substantial $471.7 million in Q1 2025. This represents a significant 19% increase compared to the same period last year (year-over-year). Adjusted EBITDA: The exchange’s adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA) also grew healthily, reaching $187.4 million. This figure is up 17% year-over-year, indicating improved operational efficiency and profitability. Trading Volume: Perhaps one of the most telling signs of market activity on the platform, Kraken’s trading volume surged by an impressive 29% year-over-year. This indicates increased user engagement and activity on the exchange. These figures collectively point towards a period of strong expansion and profitability for Kraken during the first three months of 2025. Understanding Kraken Revenue Growth: What’s Driving the Success? The 19% year-over-year increase in Kraken Revenue didn’t happen in a vacuum. Several factors likely contributed to this positive trajectory. The broader cryptocurrency market sentiment often plays a crucial role in exchange performance. A resurgent market, potentially driven by renewed investor interest, macroeconomic factors, or significant industry developments, can lead to increased trading activity. Furthermore, Kraken’s own strategies and platform developments are key. Investments in technology, user experience, security, and expanding product offerings (like staking services, derivatives, or new asset listings) can attract and retain users, directly impacting revenue through trading fees and other services. The reported surge in trading volume is a direct driver of revenue growth for exchanges like Kraken, which primarily earn from transaction fees. More volume typically means more fees collected, contributing significantly to the overall revenue picture. Cryptocurrency Trading Volume Soars: A Sign of Market Health? The 29% jump in Cryptocurrency Trading Volume on Kraken is a notable statistic. High trading volume is often interpreted as a sign of a healthy and active market. It suggests that more participants are entering or re-engaging with the market, executing trades, and utilizing exchange platforms. This increase could be a reflection of several market dynamics: Increased Retail Participation: An influx of new, smaller traders entering the market. Renewed Institutional Interest: Larger players allocating capital to digital assets. Market Volatility: Price swings can encourage more frequent trading. Specific Asset Performance: Strong performance in major cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin or Ethereum, or excitement around altcoins, can boost activity. For Kraken, this volume surge translates directly into higher potential earnings from trading fees, underpinning the overall positive financial results for Q1 2025. The Puzzle of Average Revenue Per User (ARPU): More Users, Less Per Head? Despite the impressive growth in overall revenue, EBITDA, and trading volume, there was one metric that saw a dip: Average Revenue Per User (ARPU). According to the report, ARPU fell by 11% year-over-year. While a decrease in ARPU might initially sound concerning, the report links this specifically to an “influx of new users.” This provides crucial context. Often, new users start with smaller trading volumes or utilize less revenue-intensive services compared to established, high-volume traders. Therefore, a decrease in ARPU alongside significant growth in total revenue and trading volume can indicate successful user acquisition. It suggests that while the average revenue generated by each user decreased, the sheer number of new users and the increased activity from both new and existing users more than compensated, leading to overall growth in revenue and volume. This dynamic is a common trade-off for platforms prioritizing user base expansion. What Kraken Growth Means for Crypto Exchange Performance and the Market Kraken’s strong Q1 2025 results offer insights into the broader landscape of Crypto Exchange Performance . As a major player, Kraken’s success often reflects positive trends or increased activity within the digital asset space as a whole. Robust performance from a leading exchange can instill confidence among investors and signal a healthy operational environment within the industry. The report underscores the potential for significant profitability in the crypto exchange business, particularly during periods of heightened market activity. It also highlights the competitive nature of the space, where exchanges are constantly vying for market share, user acquisition, and transaction volume. For the crypto market itself, Kraken’s increased trading volume suggests a potential uptick in liquidity and market participation, which are generally positive indicators for market health and maturity. Actionable Insights from Kraken’s Report What can we take away from Kraken’s Q1 2025 report? Market Resilience: The strong results suggest that even amidst evolving market conditions, the core business of crypto trading remains robust for well-established platforms. User Acquisition Matters: The ARPU dynamic highlights that growing the user base, even if average revenue per user dips initially, can be a successful strategy for overall revenue growth. Trading Volume is King: For exchanges, transaction volume remains a primary driver of financial success. Factors that encourage trading activity directly benefit these platforms. Competitive Landscape: While Kraken shows strong Kraken Growth , the industry remains competitive, pushing exchanges to innovate and optimize their services. These insights are valuable for investors considering exchange stocks or tokens, as well as for market observers trying to gauge the health of the crypto ecosystem. Conclusion: Kraken Starts 2025 on a High Note In summary, Kraken’s Q1 2025 financial results demonstrate a powerful start to the year. With significant year-over-year increases in revenue, adjusted EBITDA, and trading volume, the exchange is clearly capitalizing on market opportunities. While the dip in average revenue per user points to the dynamics of onboarding new users, the overall picture is one of strong growth and profitability. Kraken’s performance serves as a positive indicator for both the exchange itself and potentially the broader cryptocurrency market activity witnessed during the first quarter of 2025.

Fear blinds investors From March 2024, through to November 2024, as Bitcoin traversed sideways and downwards in that seemingly endless bull flag, many in the market may have capitulated, especially when the price wicked down to that $49,100 local bottom. Then, once the $BTC price had shot out of the top of the bull flag and made a new all-time high at $109,000, the price rolled over and downwards. Many feared that the top was now in for this cycle, and that this was a spiral into the next bear market. Given that the price fell more than 30%, and down just under $74,500, many in the market were extremely bearish, and if they hadn’t capitulated the last time, they surely were going to this time. The Crypto Fear and Greed Index sank as low as a score of 10, while the U.S. stock market Fear and Greed Index got all the way down to almost rock bottom with a score of 3. Both indexes were in ‘Extreme Fear’. While in the depths of despair at these bottoms, it was so very difficult to see a way out. The US and global economies were going through very stormy weather, and it looked as though any of the major economies could crash at any moment, bringing the rest with them like a collapsing pack of cards. You only have to recognise Bitcoin for what it is However, throughout the maelstrom of bad economic, geopolitical, and political news one only needed to step back, look at the macro chart, know that money printing would arrive eventually, and recognise that Bitcoin was the best-looking lifeboat among a very small and select group of other lifeboats. It has always been that simple, and most of us just could not see the wood for the trees. When in doubt, one only has to see Bitcoin for what it is. It can’t be manipulated. Only 21 million can ever be issued. No third parties need to be involved. It’s completely outside of any government control. Can be sent to anyone in the world. Settles instantly. Negligible fees for sending large amounts. You can custody it yourself. A quick look at the competition If one then looks at the competition; fiat currency can be printed to oblivion, it can be manipulated by governments. Transactions go through third parties. Transactions can be stopped. Bank accounts can be frozen or confiscated. Purchasing power is diminishing ever more rapidly. If Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDCs) are introduced, every last vestige of control over your own money would be lost. If one then looks at gold, the traditional store of value, and flight to safety, history shows us that governments have been able to manipulate, suppress, and control its price. Gold holdings by central banks are completely opaque. More can be dug out of the ground. Try sending $1 billion worth of gold to a creditor in another country. Bitcoin bull market is far from over Source: TradingView The weekly Bitcoin chart above displays the price action since 2021. This is a thing of beauty. While the bull market that finished in 2021 was possibly curtailed due to all the shenanigans of the Biden administration, this current bull market has the hallmarks of potentially doing a whole lot better. The price action of the big bull flag, followed by the falling wedge are both large continuation patterns. Once this surge is able to get through current resistance, it has the potential to easily reach the all-time high and then begin the next sortie into price discovery.

Here's Why…,https://en.bitcoinsistemi.com/surprise-move-from-sec-approved-company-sold-all-altcoins-and-switched-to-bitcoin-heres-why/,"Investment advisory firm Two Prime made a surprising decision and announced that it sold its Ethereum holdings and switched to Bitcoin. We're Moving Completely From Ethereum to Bitcoin! Accordingly, the SEC-approved firm, Two Prime, stated that it will abandon Ethereum due to its memecoin-like behavior and insufficient price performance, while doubling its Bitcoin (BTC) allocation. “For the past six years, Two Prime, an SEC-registered investment advisor, has operated as one of the world’s largest digital asset derivatives firms by volume. Additionally, in the last 15 months, Two Prime has completed over $1.5 billion in loans, making it the second largest lender globally for BTC and ETH collateralized loans. Despite our success with ETH, we have decided as a firm to focus solely on BTC asset management and lending from now on. “ETH's statistical trading behavior, value proposition, and community culture have failed to capture traction beyond the point of being worthwhile. With BTC available as an alternative, the risk-reward ratio has taken precedence.” Ethereum (ETH) Is Acting Like A Memecoin! Two Prime noted that ETH is now behaving more like a memecoin rather than a predictable asset. The statement noted that ETH has been showing more signs of weakness since its independence from Bitcoin in Q1 2025, with the ETH/BTC ratio falling to its lowest level in five years given ETH’s lackluster price performance in 2025. The company also said that Ethereum did not show any signs of recovery after the declines and that investors did not buy the decline, indicating a lack of interest in the largest altcoin. For all these reasons, the company stated that it will exit ETH and focus entirely on BTC. “Ultimately, Ethereum's current scale and the remaining upside potential for global adoption make BTC a much better risk-weighted investment vehicle than ETH.” *This is not investment advice.

Specifically, after falling to 2025 lows near $75,000 on April 7 and April 8, as Liberation Day tariffs pushed stock and cryptocurrencies lower, and bond yields and gold higher, BTC set an upward course and achieved a multi-month high above $97,000 on May 1. The subsequent correction, as relatively mild as it has been, demonstrated that Bitcoin’s journey will not be smooth. Indeed, the world’s premier cryptocurrency has entered a seemingly stable zone between $96,000 and $97,000 in the last 24 hours and is, at press time on May 2, changing hands at $96,739. BTC 30-day price chart. Source: Finbold Bitcoin could see major price action if it hits these levels Under the circumstances, Bitcoin is unlikely to make a major move unless it falls below the nearest support zone, $94,657, or above the resistance, $97,828. Simultaneously, though a strong move beyond either of the barriers could lead to greater changes, it is relatively unlikely BTC will immediately be able to reclaim its past highs or crash to its recent lows. The world’s premier cryptocurrency has been moving in bursts throughout the bull market , which started with a major Solana ( SOL ) rally in late 2023. Examining the long-term charts reveals that most of the gains that eventually took Bitcoin to its all-time high (ATH) above $109,000 and, verily, to its current relatively high above $96,000 were achieved through short and strong upsurges followed by protracted periods of relative stagnation. What will be Bitcoin’s next price move Unless BTC makes a large move in the coming days, it could spend most of May trading within its current range, with any moves below the nearest support or above the resistance rapidly increasing pressure and returning it to the prevailing equilibrium. Simultaneously, if Bitcoin’s price moves more, a downside appears more likely than an upside. The cryptocurrency’s relative strength index ( RSI ) came in at a high of 69.88, thanks to the strong rally in the previous two weeks, positioning BTC as dangerously overbought.

Kraken started the year with strong momentum. Despite a shifting market, it still delivered robust growth and disciplined execution, which is evident in its financial results. Kraken made $472 million in gross revenue for Q1 2025 and an adjusted EBITDA of $187 million. Source: Kraken Kraken made bank in the first quarter Kraken also attracted more customers and investors in a volatile market. It recorded 26% more customers than last year, and those customers traded 29% more. Aside from the revenue, Kraken also acquired a trading platform and futures broker known as NinjaTrader. The acquisition will allow crypto traders to soon be able to seamlessly access traditional derivatives within Kraken’s trading experience while derivatives traders will be able to access crypto markets on the NinjaTrader platform. Kraken has also added new features to the brand, including Kraken Pay, a method for sending money or crypto anywhere, a new Kraken consumer app that makes it easy for investors to buy various asset classes, and asset staking. The report also showcases Kraken’s accountability as it announced the completion of its latest proof of reserves for supported cryptocurrencies as of March 31, 2025. Unlike the industry standard of relying on an auditor’s single attestation, Kraken enables clients to independently confirm that their assets are fully backed on-chain. Kraken is one of the only exchanges doing this, and it said it will continue to publish these reports every few months. Kraken’s report matters for its future plans Despite Trump’s tariffs, which damaged investor confidence and slowed trading as people took shelter in safe assets like gold, Kraken still outperformed the conditions, expanded its customer base, and increased revenue. This could encourage its IPO endeavors as it presents a positive image and makes a bullish case for why investors might want to own a piece of its stock offering. The report and the achievements also attest to the company’s overall health, which could also excite people about its future prospects. The conversation of a Kraken IPO has been making the rounds since 2022, but it looks like it could finally happen within the first three months of 2026. The exchange is reportedly monitoring the market to pick the perfect time. The Trump administration and its pro-crypto moves might have also encouraged the decision to go public. Other crypto exchanges like Coinbase have gone the IPO route in the past, and Kraken plans to be the latest. Cryptopolitan Academy: Coming Soon - A New Way to Earn Passive Income with DeFi in 2025.

44061815,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=154542,1746178841,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,"Amazon AI: Primitive AI Agents Power New Digital Assistant, Reaching 100k Users",https://bitcoinworld.co.in/amazon-ai-digital-assistant/,"In the rapidly evolving tech landscape, where innovations like blockchain and decentralized finance are constantly pushing boundaries, the progress of Artificial Intelligence, particularly Generative AI , is a parallel development that warrants close attention. Amazon’s recent update on its upgraded digital assistant offers a glimpse into the pace and challenges of widespread AI Adoption in the consumer space. Generative AI Powers Amazon’s New Digital Assistant Amazon CEO Andy Jassy recently announced a significant milestone for the company’s upgraded digital assistant, now powered by Generative AI and dubbed Alexa+. During a recent earnings call, Jassy confirmed that this advanced version has now been rolled out to over 100,000 users. While this figure is modest compared to the vast 600 million existing Alexa devices worldwide, it marks tangible progress since Alexa+’s initial unveiling in February. The company outlined a phased rollout strategy at the time, and reaching six figures indicates the process is underway. AI Agents: Ambitious Goals Meet Early Challenges The core ambition behind Alexa+ is to transform the traditional, command-based interaction of a Digital Assistant into a more fluid, natural conversation. Beyond just understanding natural language, the vision includes developing advanced AI Agents capable of performing actions on a user’s behalf, such as interacting with third-party applications like GrubHub or generating creative content on the fly. This represents a significant leap towards systems akin to the voice capabilities seen in cutting-edge models like OpenAI’s ChatGPT and Google’s Gemini, moving away from predetermined responses. However, as reports at launch highlighted, the initial rollout of Alexa+ has encountered some expected hurdles. Several key features demonstrated by Amazon, such as the ability for the AI Agents to use third-party apps, create personalized bedtime stories, or brainstorm gift ideas, were reportedly not available to users at the outset. It remains unclear precisely when these capabilities will be fully integrated, though Jassy stated that more functionality is planned for addition in the coming months. Amazon AI Leadership Discusses Primitive Nature and Accuracy Addressing the state of this nascent technology, Jassy positioned Alexa+ as one of the first action-oriented AI Agents available to consumers. Yet, he was candid about the current limitations, describing the technology as still rather “primitive” and acknowledging its potential for inaccuracy. Jassy noted that multi-step AI Agents , which are designed to complete complex tasks involving multiple steps, currently exhibit accuracy rates typically ranging between a modest 30% and 60%. Amazon has set an ambitious internal goal for its web-browsing agent, known as Nova Act, aiming to achieve a 90% accuracy rate in this specific domain, highlighting the significant development work still required. Digital Assistant Rollouts: Amazon vs. Apple and Integration Hurdles Comparing the progress across the industry, Amazon’s rollout of Alexa+ appears to be moving forward faster than Apple’s efforts to integrate large language models (LLMs) into its own Digital Assistant , Siri. During Apple’s simultaneous earnings call, CEO Tim Cook indicated that Apple required “more time to complete the work” on the new Siri features. Both tech giants seem to be facing similar challenges on the road to supercharging their legacy assistants with Generative AI . A major difficulty lies in successfully enabling LLMs to interact with and utilize external tools and systems. While integrating LLMs allows assistants to perform practical tasks like setting timers or reading messages more naturally, achieving robust and reliable integration has proven more complex than initially anticipated for both companies. The Bigger Picture: AI Adoption in the Consumer Landscape The journey of Alexa+ from unveiling to its initial 100,000 users underscores the exciting potential and inherent difficulties in bringing advanced AI Technology into everyday consumer products. While the current version may lack some of the more ambitious features demonstrated, the rollout signifies a crucial step in widespread AI Adoption . The challenges faced by both Amazon and Apple highlight that developing truly capable and reliable AI Agents is a complex undertaking, requiring significant technological advancement and refinement. The progress, though incremental, is a key indicator of how AI will likely integrate into future digital interactions, a trend that is relevant to anyone navigating the evolving tech landscape, including the world of decentralized technologies.

44061816,https://finbold.com/?p=244686,1746178918,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/finbold.png,Crypto’s billionaires are making headlines; here’s what they’re buying,https://finbold.com/cryptos-billionaires-are-making-headlines-heres-what-theyre-buying/,"Forget charts and tokenomics for a second—crypto billionaires are rewriting the playbook on how wealth gets spent. One launched a $55 million SpaceX mission over the poles. Another made headlines by purchasing the Eurovision trophy at an auction supporting Ukraine. One literally buried $2 million worth of treasures across the U.S., while another casually keeps an orangutan as a pet. And let’s not forget the guy who ate a $5 million banana onstage. These aren’t just flexes—they’re loud, chaotic, and often genius-level PR stunts. And they say more about the culture of crypto than any whitepaper ever could. In this article, we’ll dive into some of the most bizarre, surprising, and fascinating investments made by crypto billionaires—and take a closer look at one of the most elusive parts of their identity—and more importantly, what their spending reveals about the scale of their wealth. One thing’s for sure—we’re all a little curious about how the rich spend their money. Because when crypto billionaires go off-chain, things tend to spiral from spreadsheets into spectacle. To better understand how crypto billionaires behave financially, it’s useful to look at recurring lifestyle patterns that shape their approach to wealth and influence. Many of them fall into a mix of three archetypes: the minimalist, the builder, and the extravagant. Some—like Ethereum’s Vitalik Buterin and Polkadot’s Gavin Wood—favor low-profile lives, focusing their fortunes on research, philanthropy, and ecosystem growth rather than luxury. Others, such as Coinbase’s Brian Armstrong or WhiteBIT’s Volodymyr Nosov, are tireless builders who channel their wealth into blockchain infrastructure and public initiatives, while remaining firmly in the public eye and actively shaping their public personas. Yet, crypto’s more flamboyant side is impossible to ignore. From Richard Heart’s flashy wardrobe to Justin Sun’s art-stunt headlines, these figures live boldly and visibly. Even builders like Nosov occasionally step into this world—his purchase of Freddie Mercury’s car suggests a taste for symbolic flair. Ultimately, these personas reflect more than ego; they serve strategic purposes—signaling confidence, reinforcing brand identity, or expressing deeply held values through action. The $2M crypto treasure hunt no one’s solved yet One of the most mind-bending crypto stunts comes from American millionaire John Collins-Black, who literally turned treasure hunting into an art form. Inspired by Forrest Fenn’s famous buried treasure, Collins-Black, whose estimated net worth allows for multi-million dollar projects like this, hid five chests worth a combined $2 million across the U.S.—and encoded the clues to their locations in a book he authored titled There’s Treasure Inside. Among the buried items? A physical Casascius Bitcoin, a Colombian emerald, a rare 2002 Pokémon Shining Charizard card, and a dessert bowl that once belonged to George Washington. If no one finds them, he says, he’ll release new clues every 8–10 years. Because why just HODL when you can hide your bags like a pirate? The $55 million flex that left earth’s orbit What’s the ultimate flex for a crypto millionaire? Apparently, it’s going to space. In March 2025, Chun Wang—co-founder of F2Pool and Stakefish—became the first crypto billionaire to fully fund and board a SpaceX mission that orbited Earth over both poles. The mission, called Fram2, cost Wang an eye-watering $55 million. But that wasn’t just a joyride—Wang and his international crew conducted 22 experiments, including the first X-ray scan of a human body in space and mushroom cultivation in microgravity. According to multiple crypto industry sources, Wang’s net worth is estimated at over $1 billion, largely accumulated through early mining operations and infrastructure investments in the blockchain space. Wang isn’t alone in crypto-space ambitions. Virgin Galactic also accepted Bitcoin payments for spaceflights, with the first crypto-funded seat bought by a Hawaiian investor for $250,000 back in 2013. Galactic gains, indeed. The $5M banana that fed the hype machine Justin Sun took things to the next level—literally eating Maurizio Cattelan’s infamous banana artwork, Comedian, during a live event in a $5 million publicity stunt. Originally sold at Art Basel Miami for $120,000, the banana taped to a wall became an instant meme in the art world. Sun transformed the viral piece into a crypto-infused performance spectacle, claiming that his version involved complex licensing, media production, and PR orchestration—pushing the total price tag north of $5 million. Equal parts absurd and strategic, the stunt cemented his status as one of crypto’s most flamboyant showmen. When your crypto wallet buys you a zoo One of the most outrageous displays of crypto wealth came from Djordje Novakovic, a flamboyant trader who dubbed himself the “James Bond of crypto.” After earning over £30 million through forex, crypto, and NFTs, Novakovic didn’t just splurge on supercars, private jets, and luxury watches—he went as far as keeping a pet orangutan. The exotic primate, reportedly living in his lavish estate, became a symbol of Novakovic’s taste for the eccentric—and it’s not the only exotic pet he has. Djordje also keeps company with a baby tiger. His social media became a catalog of decadence: designer suits, champagne showers, and yes—a literal ape in the background. It wasn’t just about flaunting wealth—it was about crafting a surreal identity where shock value and extravagance became a strategic personal brand. He didn’t go to space, he elevated Eurovision’s market value There’s Volodymyr Nosov,Founder and President of WhiteBIT Group, who made headlines by purchasing the Eurovision trophy won by Kalush Orchestra for 500 ETH—nearly $900,000. Yes, we finally know how much a Eurovision trophy is worth in crypto. And Nosov? He seems to be one of those billionaires who prefers music over Mars. With the backing of WhiteBIT—whose reported capitalization of about $38 billion—Nosov has positioned himself among the most financially influential figures in crypto. Beyond Eurovision, he also acquired Freddie Mercury’s classic Rolls-Royce for $11 million and even took a bold step into sports by purchasing a football club—moves that only seem natural when your billionaire status makes just about any headline-making acquisition feel like a power move. So… what’s next? A crypto-funded coliseum where gladiators fight for NFTs? A zoo where each animal is named after a meme coin—meet Shiba the lemur and Doge the capybara? Or maybe a rocket launch that etches a Bitcoin logo on the Moon?

The number didn’t move from where it was in March, even though economists had expected it to dip closer to the European Central Bank’s 2% target. Analysts surveyed by Reuters had predicted a small decline from March’s 2.2% as inflation appeared to slow over recent months. That didn’t happen. Headline inflation stayed flat, showing no sign of easing further this time around. Underneath the headline number, core inflation went up. It rose to 2.7% in April from 2.4% the month before. Core inflation excludes food, energy, tobacco, and alcohol. The rise shows that the broader pressures on prices aren’t done yet. Services inflation also jumped, reaching 3.9%, up from 3.5% in March. Both numbers show that while the overall inflation rate held steady, deeper parts of the economy are still running hot. Across the bloc, national figures also came in. On Wednesday, Germany’s federal statistics office said it expects harmonized consumer prices to rise 2.2% in April. That’s a drop from the month before, but still slightly higher than what was forecast. Meanwhile, France posted a harmonized inflation rate of 0.8%, a bit higher than expected too. These figures are harmonized for consistency across the Eurozone. Speaking last week, European Central Bank President Christine Lagarde told CNBC, “We’re heading towards our [inflation] target in the course of 2025, so that disinflationary process is so much on track that we are nearing completion.” Christine added that the ECB would be “data dependent to the extreme” when making calls on interest rates. She didn’t give a timeline for more cuts but warned that the medium-term path for inflation was uncertain. Christine and other policymakers raised concerns about possible trade retaliation from Europe in response to U.S. tariffs, now a growing risk under President Donald Trump’s administration. They also mentioned that big fiscal plans like Germany’s infrastructure package could affect future price levels. Last month, the ECB cut its key interest rate, bringing the deposit facility rate down to 2.25%. That rate had peaked at 4% in mid-2023. The bank is keeping its eyes on inflation trends and will adjust again only if the numbers justify it. This week also saw new signs of life in the Eurozone economy. Preliminary data showed that the bloc’s GDP grew 0.4% in the first quarter of 2025. That beat forecasts, which expected 0.2% growth. It also followed a revised 0.2% growth in the final quarter of 2024. Cryptopolitan Academy: Tired of market swings? Learn how DeFi can help you build steady passive income.

Tokenization has become a buzzword, unfortunately, it’s failing to prove its value. Investors remain unconvinced, and inconsistent regulations are stalling progress. Too often, assets are being tokenized just for the sake of it, without providing any improvements in accessibility, efficiency, or liquidity. Tokenized portfolios on-chain sound sexy and exciting to crypto native investors, but that’s a small niche of the market. For tokenization to truly take off, it needs buy-in from institutional and retail investors who want to modernize traditional assets, and not just create digital twins of inefficient traditional products. You might also like: Tokenization as a funding backdoor for European founders | Opinion So far, the industry’s focus has been on compliance and replicating real-world assets onchain, but mainstream investors still lack compelling reasons to engage. Despite institutional interest from firms like BlackRock, adoption remains sluggish because the industry has failed to address core investment concerns. Tokenized assets are still difficult to trade, lack liquidity, and exist in a fragmented regulatory landscape. This complication and doubt cause traditional investors with big portfolios to not even bother with the space at all—some of whom see Bitcoin ( BTC ) as a Ponzi scheme. Institutional investors have to get involved in making some decisions around investing in cryptocurrency, but it will take time. Providing the proper education and tools is critical when understanding how to navigate tokenized assets confidently. The core reality check Tokenization should focus on expanding practical functionality for investors. Boston Consulting Group, in a recent white paper, projects in multiple scenarios that tokenization of assets could reach trillions of dollars of Amulet (AUM) by 2030. Real value means greater liquidity, better assessment options, increased transparency, and trust in a system that can smartly utilize these assets. Currently, when you hold these assets with major institutions and custodians, your options are extremely limited. In some cases, assets can be used as collateral, but the process remains convoluted and restrictive. For example, we’re not talking about crypto native investors that put $28.6 trillion worth of assets onchain. More so, pension fund managers, and I can’t imagine them using a MetaMask wallet to hold real-world assets tokens and utilize them in a smart contract to provide decentralized finance functionality. Tokenization presents a unique opportunity to transform traditional finance. By turning static assets into smart contracts, these tokens can automate a lot of financial processes and create new use cases not available in traditional finance. However, we cannot rely on the old legacy financial infrastructure: traditional custodians, fund managers, and administrators. According to the World Economic Forum, tokenization could unlock collateral mobility that has never been possible. The process remains costly and time-consuming,and neither institutional nor retail investors will engage. It’s time to turn this into a reality and commit to delivering real, tangible value to attract long-term adoption. Make it make sense Regulatory clarity remains inconsistent and has created a fragmented market. Jurisdictions like the Hong Kong Monetary Authority and Abu Dhabi Global Market are taking proactive steps, but a fragmented global landscape makes compliance a major challenge. For instance, if I want to tokenize an asset in the ADGM and ensure compatibility with a tokenized asset under the HKMA, or want to trade on a decentralized exchange, I would need to comply with both the ADGM regulations, where I am based, and the HKMA regulations. Now, imagine that there are not just two jurisdictions, but 150. When each has its own standards and rules, compliance is nearly impossible, and the dream of a seamless financial system is dead in the water. Large financial institutions and service providers are already working to find out how they can harmonize a digital asset like tokenization with a regulatory framework. We must push for a global regulatory framework for digital assets, rather than siloed frameworks of regional legislation. Without regulatory alignment, tokenized assets risk being confined to niche markets rather than achieving true global adoption. To reach financial democratization, we need utility Tokenization shouldn’t just be about digitizing old financial models; it should create new ways for assets to be utilized, traded more efficiently, and/or borrowed against. Tokenization alone is not enough. Assets must be made smarter and deliver tangible value to global investors, regulators, and service providers. Right now, many tokenized investment opportunities are still limited to qualified investors, which reinforces existing financial barriers rather than breaking them down. True democratization means opening up access to retail investors, not just tokenizing assets for institutions. This industry is still in its early stages, which means there’s still plenty of time to shape its future the right way. If regulators, jurisdictions, and innovators can align on the proper framework, the RWA tokenization sector could see massive growth by 2030 . The future of tokenization depends on moving beyond the hype.

On May 1, the Sam Altman-backed blockchain project announced its collaboration with the stablecoin giant following its limited expansion into the U.S. According to the official announcement, World ( WLD ) Chain plans to integrate the company’s stablecoin, USD Coin ( USDC ), as well its CCTP V2 mechanism to its World Chain. First introduced in April 2023, CCTP V2 is an upgraded version of Circle’s Cross-Chain Transfer Protocol, designed to enable faster and more efficient USDC transfers across blockchains. The integration would allow nearly two million verified users on World who already hold bridged USDC in their World App wallets to convert them into native USDC. This means all their stablecoin assets will be backed on a 1:1 ratio with U.S. dollars and other cash-equivalent assets. Not only that, with the addition of CCTP V2 to World Chain, users will be able to transfer USDC across various chains in a faster and more cost effective way. “The combo accelerates World Network while opening up access to USDC to more humans in economies that can benefit from a fully-reserved digital dollar,” wrote World project in its official statement. You might also like: Circle receives Abu Dhabi in-principle approval to operate as a money services provider Although the announcement does not specify the exact date for when the integration takes place, it does highlight some key benefits that users will receive through the collaboration. First, all verified users on the World Chain will be able to send remittances using the dollar-pegged stablecoin without incurring high transfer fees. Next, eligible businesses registered on the World Chain will be able to access institutional on/off-ramps via Circle Mint. Additionally, developers can build using USDC directly into World App Mini Apps and tap into its globally distributed blockchain. The project also plans to bring EURC ( EURC ), Circle’s MiCA compliant stablecoin pegged to the euro, for its users in the near future. Most recently, World announced its expansion into the U.S, making it available for users living in Atlanta, Austin, Los Angeles, Miami, Nashville and San Francisco. The project previously faced backlash from countries like Brazil and Hong Kong over privacy concerns due to the project’s iris-scanning verification system.

44062116,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=154538,1746179444,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Massive XRP Transfer: 300 Million XRP Moves to Ripple Wallet,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/massive-xrp-transfer-ripple/,"In the dynamic world of cryptocurrency, large movements of digital assets often capture the attention of investors and analysts alike. A recent report from the popular blockchain tracking service, Whale Alert , has highlighted a significant XRP transfer that is currently circulating through the crypto community. According to their data, a staggering 300,000,000 XRP tokens have been moved from an address labeled as ‘unknown wallet’ directly into a wallet associated with Ripple , the company behind the XRP Ledger. This particular transaction, valued at approximately $665 million at the time of the report, represents a substantial sum and naturally raises questions about the motivations and potential impact behind such a large-scale movement of digital currency. Understanding the context of these large transfers is crucial for anyone following the XRP market or interested in the activities of major players like Ripple and significant crypto holders, often referred to as a crypto whale . What is a Whale Alert and Why Does it Matter? Before diving deeper into the specifics of this XRP transfer , it’s helpful to understand the source of the information. Whale Alert is a service that tracks and reports large transactions on various blockchains. Think of it as a public ledger monitor specifically focused on big money movements. Why is this important? Transparency: It provides a layer of transparency in the often opaque world of large crypto holdings. Market Sentiment: Large transfers can sometimes signal upcoming market activity, such as potential selling pressure if funds move to exchanges, or accumulation if funds move off exchanges. Tracking Big Players: It allows the community to observe the movements of major holders and entities, including companies like Ripple or individual crypto whale investors. While a Whale Alert report doesn’t always indicate immediate price action, it offers valuable data points for analysis and speculation within the community. Analyzing the 300 Million XRP Transfer to Ripple The core detail of this report is the movement of 300,000,000 XRP directly to a Ripple wallet. The ‘unknown wallet’ designation simply means the source address hasn’t been publicly identified or associated with a known entity by blockchain explorers or tracking services. However, the destination wallet being linked to Ripple provides a clear direction for the funds. Here are some potential interpretations and considerations regarding this significant transfer: Internal Treasury Management: Ripple holds a substantial amount of XRP , much of which is held in escrow to provide predictability and stability to the supply. This transfer could be part of Ripple ‘s internal management of its treasury, moving funds between different internal wallets for operational purposes, security, or preparing for scheduled releases from escrow. Preparation for Sales: Ripple has historically sold small amounts of XRP programmatically or for On-Demand Liquidity (ODL) purposes. While this transfer is large, it doesn’t automatically mean an imminent market dump. However, moving funds to a more accessible wallet could be a precursor to future planned sales or use in ODL corridors. Escrow Management: Ripple releases 1 billion XRP from escrow each month, with a significant portion typically returned to new escrow contracts. This transfer might be related to the movement of funds back into or out of these escrow wallets as part of the monthly cycle. Over-the-Counter (OTC) Deals: Sometimes, large blocks of XRP are moved for OTC deals with institutional buyers or partners. This transfer could be related to fulfilling such an agreement, though moving from ‘unknown’ to Ripple suggests it’s more likely an internal or inbound movement. The sheer size of the transfer – 300 million XRP – underscores its importance. At $665 million, it represents a significant portion of the daily trading volume for XRP on many exchanges, highlighting the potential impact if these funds were to enter the open market quickly. What Could This Mean for XRP Holders and the Market? For individuals holding XRP , news of such a large transfer can spark both curiosity and concern. Will this lead to selling pressure? Is Ripple planning something big? Potential Implications: Increased Supply Perception: If the market perceives this movement as preparing for sales, it could create downward pressure on the XRP price due to expectations of increased supply. Neutral Event: If the transfer is purely for internal management or related to escrow recycling, it might have minimal direct impact on the market price, as these funds aren’t necessarily intended for immediate sale on public exchanges. Positive Signal (Less Likely for This Transfer): In some cases, large transfers to a company wallet could signal preparations for a new product launch or expansion requiring liquid funds, though moving from ‘unknown’ to Ripple is less indicative of this than, say, moving from an exchange. It’s crucial to avoid panic or making investment decisions based solely on a single Whale Alert notification. These transfers are part of the ongoing operations of large entities in the crypto space. The Role of a Crypto Whale in the Market While the source wallet here is labeled ‘unknown’, the term crypto whale is often used to describe entities or individuals holding vast amounts of cryptocurrency. Their movements are tracked because they have the potential to influence market prices due to the sheer volume of assets they control. A single crypto whale executing a large buy or sell order can significantly impact liquidity and price discovery on exchanges. In this specific case, the ‘unknown wallet’ could represent a large early investor, a different internal Ripple wallet not publicly labeled, or even a partner moving funds. The fact that it went to Ripple suggests a connection, making it less likely a random external crypto whale simply sending funds unless it was part of a specific agreement or return of funds. Actionable Insights for Tracking Large Transfers How can you stay informed about significant movements like this XRP transfer and what can you do with this information? Follow Whale Alert: Services like Whale Alert provide real-time notifications on major transactions across various blockchains. Use Blockchain Explorers: You can use blockchain explorers (like Bithomp for XRP) to look up the transaction details, although ‘unknown’ addresses offer limited information. Context is Key: Always try to put the transfer into context. Where did the funds come from? Where did they go? What is the entity’s known behavior (e.g., Ripple ‘s escrow releases)? Don’t Overreact: A single large transfer is rarely enough to predict market direction. Look for patterns, consider overall market sentiment, and analyze other fundamental and technical factors. Educate Yourself: Understand the typical operations of major players like Ripple , including their escrow system and ODL activities, to better interpret their on-chain movements. This specific 300 million XRP transfer to Ripple is a prime example of a large on-chain event that warrants attention but requires careful interpretation. It highlights the ongoing activity within the XRP ecosystem and the importance of transparency tools like Whale Alert in monitoring the movements of significant amounts of crypto. Summary: Decoding the Massive XRP Transfer The report of 300,000,000 XRP moving from an unknown wallet to Ripple , valued at $665 million, is undoubtedly a headline-grabbing event. While the ‘unknown’ source adds a layer of mystery, the destination wallet clearly links the movement to Ripple itself. This transfer is likely related to Ripple ‘s internal treasury management, escrow operations, or potentially preparing funds for strategic use, such as ODL expansion or planned sales, although the latter is speculative based on this single data point. Tracking services like Whale Alert play a vital role in bringing these large XRP transfer s to light, offering valuable insights into the activities of major holders and companies like Ripple . For investors, such reports serve as a reminder to stay informed but also to conduct thorough research and avoid making impulsive decisions based solely on whale movements. The world of XRP and large crypto transactions is complex, but understanding the tools and context helps shed light on these significant on-chain events.

The hacker attempted to infiltrate the ranks of the US tech firm by applying for a job position, the exchange detailed . The impersonated applicant applied for an engineering role at Kraken, raising multiple red flags during different stages of interview. “From the outset, something felt off about this candidate,” Kraken wrote in a blog on Thursday. “Even more suspicious, the candidate occasionally switched between voices, indicating that they were being coached through the interview in real time.” However, the exchange said that it put the candidate through their interview paces in order to “learn more about their tactics at every stage of the process.” The Truth Was Clear, This Was Not a Legitimate Applicant: Kraken Before the interview, Kraken said that industry partners had tipped them off that North Korean hackers were actively applying for jobs at crypto companies. Per the investigations, the candidate initially joined a video call using a different name from the one on his resume. Further, Kraken identified that the hacker’s email address matched one of the addresses linked to the North Korean hacker group . “We discovered that one of the emails associated with the malicious candidate was part of a larger network of fake identities and aliases.” Besides, among the candidate’s multiple identities, one in this network was also a “known foreign agent on the sanctions list.” Suspect Was Put Through Multiple Technical Infosec Tests The exchange carefully advanced the candidate through the hiring rounds instead of turning him down. Kraken’s security and recruitment teams put the hacker through multiple rounds of technical infosec tests and verification tasks. These tests were “designed to extract key details about their identity and tactics,” the team wrote. During the final round of interview, traps were set when the hacker was asked to verify his location and recommend nice restaurants in the city he claimed to live in. “At this point, the candidate unravelled,” Kraken said, adding that the hacker struggled with the basic verification tests. “Don’t trust, verify,” said Nick Percoco, Kraken’s chief security officer. “State-sponsored attacks aren’t just a crypto, or U.S. corporate, issue – they’re a global threat.” The post Kraken Spots North Korean Job Seeker Attempting to Gain Exchange’s Access appeared first on Cryptonews .",Blockchain News|Hackers|Kraken,EN,0,0,EXCHANGE|TRADING,"{'name': 'cryptonews', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptonews.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptonews,2025-05-02 09:52:47

Movement announced the suspension of Manche in a May 2 X post , explaining that the “decision was made in light of ongoing events.” The decision follows Coinbase's recent decision to suspend the Movement Network (MOVE) trading, citing the token’s failure to meet its listing standards. Source: Movement The suspension came after a recently announced third-party review requested by the Movement Network Foundation into an agreement orchestrated by Manche with Rentech — the latter helped broker an agreement with market maker Web3Port. Private intelligence firm Groom Lake is conducting the investigation. This was followed by Web3Port reportedly selling the 66 million MOVE that it gained through the deal — about 5% of the total supply. This led to $38 million in downward price pressure in December 2024. Groom Lake has not answered Cointelegraph’s inquiry by press time.

On the other hand, when the wrong incentives are set, market makers can kill a project as it is taking its first steps in the market. A summer 2024 report suggests that up to 78% of new token listings since April 2024 have been poorly conducted, with some suggesting that market makers are involved . Related: How to choose a market maker for your Web3 project Lawsuits claim market maker manipulation Creditors of bankrupt cryptocurrency lending platform Celsius Network have alleged that leading crypto market maker Wintermute was involved in the wash trading of the Celsius token . Wash trading is a form of market manipulation that creates the illusion that a particular asset is trading at a higher volume than it actually is. This is far from the only such case. In late 2024, Fracture Labs, creator of the Web3 game Decimated, filed suit against market maker Jump Crypto for allegedly orchestrating a pump-and-dump scheme using its in-game currency, DIO. Another notable example is a Wall Street Journal report claimed that DWF Labs, one of Binance’s largest trading clients, engaged in market manipulation, wash trading and inflated trading volumes amounting to $300 million through deals with crypto projects. DWF Labs and Binance later denied the accusation in May 2024. Last month, a Massachusetts court fined crypto market maker CLS Global for fraudulent manipulation of trading volumes. In late February, the founder of a so-called crypto hedge fund and market maker called Gotbit was extradited from Portugal to the US , where he faces market manipulation charges and wire fraud conspiracy.

Pepe Over the past week, Pepe (PEPE) has seen a significant price increase, up 16.56%. This upward trend has continued over the past month, with a 25.04% rise. However, when looking at the six-month timeframe, the coin has seen a slight decline of 6.62%, indicating some volatility in its performance. Currently, PEPE is trading between $0.000007587 and $0.000009869. The nearest resistance level is at $0.000010978, and if the coin breaks through this point, it could target the second resistance level of $0.000013260, offering potential gains. On the downside, the nearest support level is $0.000006414, with a second support at $0.000004132, which could limit losses if the price falls. Technical indicators present a mixed outlook. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) stands at 56.39, suggesting that the coin is neither overbought nor oversold. The Stochastic indicator is relatively high at 84.70, which might indicate overbought conditions and a possible upcoming correction. The Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) level is positive, hinting at bullish momentum. Additionally, the 10-day Simple Moving Average is close to the 100-day average, showing potential for continued growth. Based on this data, PEPE might continue its upward trajectory in the short term, but traders should watch for signs of a pullback. Shiba Inu Over the past week, Shiba Inu has seen a 10.91% price increase. Over the last month, it increased by 8.37%. However, over the past six months, the price has dropped by 25.35%. This shows that while there is short-term growth, the coin is still recovering from a longer-term decline. The current price range is between $0.000011996 and $0.00001506. The nearest resistance level is at $0.00001669, and the closest support level is at $0.00001055. If the price moves above the resistance, it could head toward the second resistance at $0.00001976. This would be a 30% increase from the current upper range. If the price falls below the support, it might drop to the second support at $0.000007483, which would be a decrease of about 35%. Technical indicators are showing mixed signals. The Relative Strength Index is at 50.11, suggesting neutral momentum. The Stochastic value is 62.62, indicating that the coin is neither overbought nor oversold. The 10-day and 100-day Simple Moving Averages are close, at $0.00001375 and $0.00001392, respectively, hinting at possible price consolidation. The MACD level is slightly positive at 0.00000001966, which could suggest a mild upward trend. Based on this data, SHIB might continue to rise if it breaks the resistance levels, but caution is advised as it could also fall to lower support levels. Conclusion PEPE and SHIB were impressive, but XYZVerse could be the next big thing, uniting sports fans in a memecoin aiming for 20,000% growth during this bull run.

It is about locking into projects with real-world traction, big plans, and the tech to back them up. With big shifts happening across AI, decentralized finance, and meme culture, some coins are standing taller than others for long-term growth potential. In this article, we break down the best long term crypto choices based on the latest updates, real utility, and where the momentum is building strongest. From AI-powered automation to huge institutional interest, these coins are drawing serious attention for what they are building into 2025 and beyond. Here is why Unstaked, Ethereum, XRP, and Dogecoin could be the moves worth making now. 1. Unstaked: AI and Crypto Collide for 2,700% Growth Unstaked is one of the hottest picks for anyone looking for the best long term crypto. It is bringing AI into blockchain in a way nobody else has yet, not with empty promises, but with actual tools that let people deploy autonomous AI agents across Telegram, Discord, and X. These agents are built for real-world tasks like managing communities, creating content, and generating engagement, and they can be upgraded and customized through NFTs. With its Proof of Intelligence model rewarding based on actual work done, Unstaked is changing how tokens work by tying rewards to real action, not just holding coins. The $UNSD token is still in presale at $0.006695 in its stage 2, with a listing price set at $0.1819, that’s a projected 2,700% return for early buyers. The presale has shown its bullish chops with over $1 million in inflows in just under a week. Unstaked’s focus on ownership of AI agents, instant utility, and no reliance on hype makes it a serious contender for the best long term crypto. With 60% of tokens open to public presale and no VC allocations, it is geared fully towards the community. As AI and Web3 keep merging, Unstaked ’s position is looking stronger by the day. 2. Ethereum: Institutional Confidence Grows Ethereum has re-established itself as a frontrunner for the best long term crypto after a big recovery in April 2025. ETH is currently trading around $1,799, up 14.19% from its April 9 low of $1,415. The price action, backed by rising trading volumes and strong weekly candles, is signaling bullish momentum for the months ahead. Analysts are forecasting Ethereum to hit the $4,000 mark by late 2025 if current trends continue. What is adding fuel to Ethereum’s upside is the huge increase in institutional activity. Big funds are not just buying ETH; they are staking it heavily too, betting on long-term yield and network security. Ethereum remains the core layer for DeFi, with total value locked crossing $100 billion again. Its upcoming scalability upgrades and sustained ecosystem growth make it a clear choice when hunting for the best long term crypto today. 3. XRP: Breaking Through with ETFs and Futures XRP has been hitting major milestones that reinforce its place among the best long term crypto options. Trading at $2.23 currently, XRP is riding a wave of institutional momentum with the SEC approving ProShares’ XRP futures ETF, set to launch on April 30, 2025. On top of that, CME Group is preparing to introduce cash-settled XRP futures by May, another signal that XRP is entering mainstream finance in a big way. Ripple’s $1.25 billion acquisition of Hidden Road strengthens its position in the institutional DeFi sector, further embedding XRP into serious financial operations. With President Trump proposing XRP as part of a national cryptocurrency reserve strategy and Ripple’s lawsuit with the SEC finally settled, XRP has cleared major hurdles that held it back for years. If you are searching for the best long term crypto that is backed by growing real-world adoption, XRP is right there on the list. 4. Dogecoin: Memecoin Power with Real Market Moves Dogecoin continues to surprise everyone and remains a strong contender when talking about the best long term crypto. DOGE is priced around $0.1797 as of late April 2025, and the structure of higher lows on the charts shows there is serious accumulation going on. Short-term forecasts predict movement between $0.185 and $0.199, with medium-term estimates going up to $0.320 by May. Beyond just trading patterns, real developments are supporting DOGE’s long-term story. The SEC is reviewing ETF filings for memecoins like Dogecoin, and if approved, it could trigger a whole new wave of institutional exposure. Plus, Tesla’s one-time Doge Dividend payout has brought renewed attention to the coin’s community-first culture. With its deep brand recognition and upcoming ETF catalysts, Dogecoin is not just a meme anymore, it is shaping up to be one of the smartest plays for those looking for the best long term crypto. Summing Up Locking into the best long term crypto today is about seeing where real value is building, not just following temporary pumps. Unstaked brings the kind of AI-driven real-world utility that few others can match. Ethereum continues to anchor DeFi and Web3 growth while attracting institutional support. XRP is breaking through with major financial integrations and clearing its legal roadblocks. Dogecoin, despite its meme origins, is pushing toward serious financial infrastructure inclusion. Each of these coins offers a different path, but all of them share the fundamentals needed to grow strong into 2025 and beyond. In a market where narratives can change quickly, anchoring into these proven, evolving cryptos could turn out to be the smartest move. Keep your eyes locked, the best long term crypto is already laying the foundation for the next wave.

44062442,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=154539,1746180049,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,FinCEN Cracks Down: Dangerous Huione Crypto Money Laundering Network Exposed,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/fincen-huione-crypto-crackdown/,"In a significant move against illicit financial activity, the U.S. government, through its Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN), has taken aim at Huione, a Telegram-based platform operating as an illegal marketplace. This action highlights the ongoing global effort to combat the misuse of cryptocurrencies by criminal organizations. What is Huione and Why is FinCEN Concerned? Huione operates primarily as a Chinese-language platform based in Cambodia, accessible via Telegram. While it might appear to be just another online marketplace, U.S. authorities have designated it a primary hub for Crypto Money Laundering . This designation is not taken lightly; it signifies that FinCEN views Huione as a significant threat to the integrity of the financial system. According to CoinDesk, the platform has been identified as supporting cybercrimes perpetrated by various criminal groups, including sophisticated North Korean Hackers . These actors are known for their prolific and often state-sponsored cyberattacks aimed at generating revenue for the North Korean regime, frequently targeting cryptocurrency businesses and users. How Does Huione Facilitate Illicit Activities? FinCEN’s investigation revealed that Huione serves as a critical base for laundering the proceeds derived from various online scams and cybercrimes. Specifically, the agency called out the platform’s role in facilitating the movement of cryptocurrency gained from: Pig Slaughtering Scams: A type of long-term fraud where criminals build trust with victims, often through romance or investment pitches, before convincing them to invest large sums into fake platforms, eventually taking all their money. Romance Scams: Fraudulent schemes where criminals pose as romantic partners online to elicit money from victims. Other Cybercrimes: Supporting the financial operations of other illicit online activities. The platform’s recent launch of its own stablecoin, USDH, likely further complicates tracing funds, potentially offering criminals another layer of obfuscation for their illicit gains. The Proposed Action: Cutting Off US Financial System Access The core of FinCEN’s proposal is to sever Huione’s ties to the US Financial System Access . This action, taken under Section 311 of the USA PATRIOT Act, is a powerful tool that allows FinCEN to impose special measures against foreign jurisdictions, financial institutions, or transactions of primary money laundering concern. If the proposal is finalized, U.S. financial institutions would be prohibited from opening or maintaining correspondent accounts or payable-through accounts for Huione. Essentially, this aims to prevent the platform and its associated illicit actors from moving funds through the U.S. banking system, making it significantly harder for them to cash out cryptocurrency proceeds or conduct international transactions using legitimate channels. Why is Targeting Platforms Like Huione Important? FinCEN’s action against Huione underscores the commitment of regulatory bodies to address the challenges posed by the use of virtual assets in facilitating crime. Platforms that enable Crypto Money Laundering provide a critical service for criminals, allowing them to convert illicit gains into usable funds, thereby fueling further criminal activity. Targeting these choke points is seen as an effective strategy to disrupt the financial infrastructure supporting cybercrime, including operations run by groups like North Korean Hackers . By cutting off access to the US Financial System Access , authorities aim to isolate these platforms and make them less effective for laundering money. What Does This Mean for the Crypto Ecosystem? This development serves as a reminder of the ongoing risks associated with unregulated or illicit platforms within the cryptocurrency space. While blockchain technology offers numerous benefits, its pseudonymous nature can be exploited by criminals. Regulatory actions like FinCEN’s are intended to enhance the integrity of the broader financial ecosystem and build confidence by demonstrating that authorities are actively working to counter illicit uses of crypto. For legitimate users and businesses, this action reinforces the importance of using regulated and compliant services and being vigilant against scams and suspicious platforms. Conclusion: A Clear Signal Against Crypto-Enabled Crime FinCEN’s proposed action to cut off Huione from the U.S. financial system sends a clear and strong signal. It demonstrates that regulators are actively monitoring the crypto landscape and are prepared to take decisive steps against platforms deemed to be facilitating Crypto Money Laundering and supporting malicious actors like North Korean Hackers . By targeting platforms like Huione and restricting their US Financial System Access , authorities are working to make the digital financial world safer and more secure for everyone.

Ranging from $122K to as high as $700K , these forecasts are built on growing institutional trust in Bitcoin as a hedge against unstable fiat currencies. Here’s a breakdown of the top predictions and the rationale behind them. Bitcoin Price Outlook for 2025: Market Trends While 2025 has seen volatility in the Bitcoin market, the overall sentiment remains bullish. In the first month, Bitcoin experienced a 9.54% rise, followed by drops in February and March of 17.5% and 2.19%, respectively. However, the market regained momentum in April, surging by 14.2%. Currently, Bitcoin is showing positive momentum with a 3.8% increase in the last week and a 1.9% jump in the past 24 hours. 2025 Bitcoin price predictions have been rolling in—and they’re staggering. Not from influencers, but from banks, hedge funds, and asset allocators. I take these with a fine grain of salt, but interesting nonetheless. Here’s what they’re projecting—and why: pic.twitter.com/yte1LhjZmI — Alec Bakhouche (@Alec_Bitcoin) May 1, 2025 Key Bitcoin Price Predictions for 2025 Standard Chartered : $200K by End of 2025 Standard Chartered forecasts Bitcoin reaching $200K by the end of the year, attributing this to decreasing trust in fiat currencies and a strong flow of institutional capital into Bitcoin. H.C. Wainwright : $225K Post-Halving Surge H.C. Wainwright predicts Bitcoin will hit $225K, driven by historical price surges post-halving and increased clarity in crypto regulation, particularly in the ETF sector. 21 Capital : $135K – $285K Range Quantitative models from 21 Capital suggest Bitcoin’s price will range from $135K to $285K, with the market showing signs of a breakout. Fundstrat (Tom Lee) : $250K Linked to US Fed Policies Fundstrat predicts Bitcoin could touch $250K if the US Federal Reserve resumes rate cuts, which would result in increased liquidity and, in turn, benefit Bitcoin. Chamath Palihapitiya : $500K as Sovereign Insurance Chamath Palihapitiya forecasts a Bitcoin price of $500K, supporting his theory that Bitcoin will evolve into a sovereign-level insurance policy, prompting more institutional and country-level adoption. VanEck : $180K Before a Summer Dip VanEck predicts Bitcoin will peak at $180K by Q4 2025, with a possible dip in the summer before a new all-time high in the year’s final quarter. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Buy Now Before Bitcoin Hits $1 Million!

GFO-X Institutional Survey : $150K Median Target A survey by GFO-X reveals that institutional traders have set the median target for Bitcoin in 2025 at around $150K. Is Bitcoin Becoming the World’s Financial Default? As trust in traditional fiat systems declines, Bitcoin is increasingly seen as a viable financial alternative. With more institutions adopting it as a hedge against inflation and currency devaluation, Bitcoin’s role is shifting from a speculative investment to a global financial fallback. If this trend continues, Bitcoin may become the go-to reserve asset during times of economic uncertainty. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

Why?",https://www.cryptopolitan.com/elizabeth-warren-fighting-for-powell-why/,"Senator Elizabeth Warren is defending Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell, after years of calling him corrupt, reckless, and dangerous. In 2025, with president Donald Trump back in the Oval, Warren is stepping in to shield Powell from Trump’s attacks, despite the fact that she has spent years trying to get him out of the job. Warren once accused Powell of weakening bank regulations and making the entire financial system “less safe.” She said there was a “culture of corruption” at the Fed after top officials resigned over improper trading. She hated his refusal to cut interest rates and called him out every time she could. But now that Trump is targeting Powell, Warren is switching sides—not because she suddenly agrees with Powell, but because she doesn’t trust Trump to keep the Fed politically neutral. And hey, an enemy of her enemy might as well be her frenemy at the very least, right? Warren says Trump’s threats to fire Powell could wreck the markets This shift came after Trump posted on Truth Social that Powell’s “termination cannot come fast enough!” Trump floated the idea of removing Powell during his first term too but backed off after market panic. So we’re essentially in a loop. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent tried to calm things down, saying Trump might have meant “terminus” differently, but Trump later said he had “no intention” of firing Powell before May 2026, when his term ends. Still, the threat was out there. Warren, who leads the Democrats on the committee that oversees financial agencies, said Powell isn’t perfect but he keeps politics out of Fed decisions. “I disagree with Powell on both monetary and regulatory policy,” Warren said this week, “but I have respect over how he’s managed the politics.” She said Powell listens to all sides but makes his own decisions. “That is as it should be.” Warren and Powell barely spoke privately for years. She hammered him over interest rates and financial regulation. But now, even though she still wants lower borrowing costs—just like Trump—she says their methods are totally different. “I don’t have any authority to make the Fed do anything,” Warren said. “All I can do is try to persuade, and that’s what I try to do. Donald Trump is not trying to make an argument of persuasion. He’s making a threat when he says that if he wants Jay Powell gone, then Jay Powell will be gone.” She warns removing Powell will drag the Fed into political chaos Warren warned that Trump’s push to fire Powell could cause serious market problems. She pointed to how investors reacted to Trump’s past trade comments. In one case, she said, capital didn’t run to US government bonds like it normally does in a crisis. “In a moment of chaos, the flight to safety did not land in the US bond market,” she said. “It went to other nations. That is a sobering moment for our nation.” She said the Fed’s role goes far beyond just setting rates. It also regulates banks, and that’s where Warren has always focused her fight. She said letting politicians control bank regulation would wreck the stability of financial markets. She mentioned that this idea of independence for regulators goes all the way back to 1863. “The Congress back in 1863 understood that if politicians could shorten or lengthen the leash on the banking regulators through the appropriations process, then no one could rely on a group of decision makers who were only thinking about safety and security of the financial system,” Warren said. She said Trump trying to remove Powell would drag the Fed into political chaos. “If Donald Trump tries to fire the head of the Fed, he’s trying to swoop banking regulation into the political stew, and monetary policy and regulatory decisions made under those circumstances will not sustain markets over the long haul,” she said. There’s also a legal fight going on. The Supreme Court is reviewing whether agencies like the Fed can remain fully independent. Some legal experts think the Court could split its authority, allowing the president to control financial rules but not interest rates. But, “there’s no such thing as, you’re half independent,” Warren said. Cryptopolitan Academy: Want to grow your money in 2025? Learn how to do it with DeFi in our upcoming webclass.

According to a May 1 blog post by Santiment’s marketing director Brian Quinlivan, online conversations about memecoins have reached their highest level of 2025, indicating a clear shift in sentiment from more stable coins to high-risk plays. Trader Mindset Shifts Toward Memecoins Just two weeks ago, the conversation was dominated by Bitcoin and layer-1 protocols, largely in reaction to Trump administration tariffs that rocked global markets. But that focus has quickly pivoted. “We’re now seeing traders embrace a gamble-first mindset,” said Quinlivan, adding that the speculative frenzy is a “telltale sign” of traders prioritizing short-term wins over long-term strategy. Quinlivan further noted that while the overall crypto market climbed 10% in the past eight days, Bitcoin’s rise was limited to 7%. This discrepancy, he suggests, is a clear indicator that investors are cycling profits from BTC into riskier altcoins and memecoins, hoping to multiply gains. Dogecoin and Pump.Fun Drive the Hype Among the many memecoins getting attention, Dogecoin has re-entered the spotlight. The surge in discussion comes on the heels of multiple filings for DOGE-based ETFs in the United States. Although the Securities and Exchange Commission has postponed its verdict on these filings until mid-June, the buzz has already reignited trader optimism. Quinlivan noted that Dogecoin’s social dominance has jumped to its highest level in nearly three months, rebounding from a deep slump in April. The resurgence seems tightly linked to Nasdaq’s ETF-related announcements, fueling speculative bets across crypto forums. Meanwhile, decentralized platforms like PumpSwap and its parent platform Pump.Fun are experiencing a meteoric rise in activity. PumpSwap’s monthly volume spiked to $11 billion in April, up from just $1.7 billion in March. Pump.Fun also surged to $3.3 billion in the same month, bolstered by its ties to memecoin launches—including a notable one linked to Donald Trump . Still, the memecoin mania has not been without hiccups. In March, investor enthusiasm dipped after the failed launch of Libra (LIBRA), which CoinGecko’s Bobby Ong highlighted as a cautionary tale. Nevertheless, the market’s appetite for risk appears undeterred—for now.

44062712,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=154540,1746180652,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Reddit AI: Unlocking Explosive Growth by Targeting Google Search Users,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/reddit-ai-targets-google/,"In the rapidly evolving digital landscape, where AI is reshaping how we access information, social platforms are adapting. Reddit, a cornerstone of online communities, is making a strategic move with its new AI initiative, specifically targeting a user base often overlooked: the ‘Seekers’. This focus on serving users coming from external search, particularly Google Search , is proving to be a key driver for Reddit Growth and financial performance. Understanding Reddit’s User Types: Scrollers vs. Seekers Reddit CEO Steve Huffman recently articulated a clear distinction between the platform’s user base: Scrollers: These users engage directly with Reddit’s core community product. They navigate through subreddits, participating in conversations about their passions, from specialized hobbies like r/sourdough to broader topics like r/popculturechat. Their primary goal is community interaction and discovery within the platform. Seekers: This group typically starts their journey outside Reddit, often on a search engine like Google. They have a specific question or query and frequently append “Reddit” to their search terms, hoping to find authentic advice, opinions, or detailed information from real people within Reddit threads. Until now, Reddit hadn’t built a dedicated product specifically for this intent. The strategic insight is that Seekers are not necessarily looking for community interaction in that moment; they are looking for a direct answer. Recognizing this distinct use case allows Reddit to build tools that more effectively meet their needs. Introducing Reddit Answers: The AI Chatbot for Seekers To cater directly to the Seekers, Reddit has developed and launched Reddit Answers . This is an AI Chatbot designed to surface relevant information from existing Reddit posts. Instead of requiring users to sift through multiple threads, Reddit Answers provides verbatim answers and concise summaries pulled from the vast amount of data already available on the platform. This Reddit AI product represents a significant shift. It acknowledges that a substantial portion of potential users are arriving with a specific information need, and it leverages artificial intelligence to make that information more accessible and digestible, bridging the gap between a search query and the relevant content within Reddit. Early Success and Global Expansion of Reddit Answers Reddit Answers, still in its beta phase, is already demonstrating promising traction. The company announced during its first-quarter earnings call that the product has reached 1 million weekly active users since its launch in December. This rapid adoption highlights the unmet need among Seekers for easier access to Reddit’s valuable content. Initially launched in the U.S., Reddit expanded the availability of Reddit Answers last month to include Australia, the U.K., Canada, and India. This global rollout indicates confidence in the product’s potential and a commitment to serving the Seeker audience worldwide. Future Integration: Deepening the AI Chatbot Experience Looking ahead to 2025, Reddit has plans to integrate Reddit Answers more deeply into the platform’s core experience. Currently, the feature resides in the app’s navigation bar as a separate entity. Future integrations aim to make the AI Chatbot more central and accessible: Primary Search Integration: A key plan is to integrate Reddit Answers into the main search box. This would allow users to type in full, natural language queries rather than just keywords, enabling the AI to provide more nuanced and relevant results. New User Onboarding: Exploring ways to introduce Answers early in the new user journey. This could help new users quickly discover the breadth of content available on Reddit related to their interests or questions, demonstrating the platform’s value immediately. External Search Points of Entry: Working on ways to leverage Answers for users coming from external search engines. This could involve providing summarized or easily parseable versions of Reddit answers directly or via optimized landing pages, making the information readily available even before a user fully enters the Reddit ecosystem. Navigating Google Search Dynamics and Reddit Growth The focus on Seekers and external search integration also has strategic implications for Reddit’s relationship with Google Search . While Reddit wants its content to be discoverable via Google, recent experiences have shown the potential volatility this relationship can entail. A Google Search algorithm change in Q4 2024 caused some fluctuation in Reddit’s user growth, highlighting a degree of dependence. By building a robust internal search and AI-powered answer system like Reddit Answers, the company can potentially create a more direct path for Seekers, making Reddit less vulnerable to external search engine algorithm changes while still benefiting from the awareness that external search provides. Strong Financials and Reddit Growth Metrics Reddit’s strategic focus appears to be paying off, as reflected in their recent financial results. The company beat analyst expectations in the first quarter, leading to a surge in its stock price during after-hours trading. Key Q1 2024 Metrics: Revenue: $392.4 million (Up 61% year-over-year) Adjusted EBITDA: $115.3 million Daily Active Unique Users (DAU): 108.1 million (A 31% YoY increase) These strong numbers, particularly the significant increase in daily active unique users, underscore the platform’s expanding reach and engagement, which the Reddit AI strategy and focus on different user segments like Seekers are likely contributing to. Looking ahead to the second quarter, Reddit provided positive guidance, estimating revenue in the range of $410 million to $430 million and adjusted EBITDA between $110 million and $130 million, suggesting continued momentum for Reddit Growth . Conclusion Reddit’s investment in Reddit AI , specifically through the AI Chatbot Reddit Answers, represents a smart strategic play. By acknowledging and building a product for the ‘Seeker’ audience – those who arrive via Google Search and other external channels looking for specific information – Reddit is unlocking new avenues for engagement and significantly contributing to its impressive Reddit Growth . This approach not only serves a previously underserved user segment but also potentially strengthens Reddit’s position in the broader digital information ecosystem, making it a more indispensable resource for millions seeking real answers from real communities.

Also, it will utilize Bridge’s payments APIs to support game marketplaces, publishers, and gamers. Moreover, the stablecoin will launch exclusively on the Sui blockchain and will be available on the handheld gaming console SuiPlay0X1 . The device is available for preorder. Meanwhile, in September 2024, Playtron announced a strategic investment from Japanese gaming giant Square Enix . Hideaki Uehara, General Manager, Investment, and Business Development of Square Enix, commented that the collaboration would leverage Playtron’s GameOS to “expand distribution of Square Enix’s portfolio of beloved franchises and explore new creative possibilities that are only possible when harnessing the full power of an operating system.” You might also like Mysten Labs Aims for 2025 Delivery of its Handheld Gaming Device with Sui Blockchain Integration Game Dollar Merges Payments Across Gaming Platforms Playtron says that GameOS seeks to unite mobile, PC, and console games into a single experience.

Game Dollar, says CPO, will expand utility for this sector. “We’re witnessing the start of a new era where gamers not only play, but participate in dynamic, self-sustaining economies.” Moreover, Kirt McMaster, co-founder and CEO of Playtron, opined that stablecoins will become a financial backbone for the $500 billion global gaming economy. Per the CEO, Game Dollar will have a role to play here, given that it can handle massive transaction volume over the next decade. “Game Dollar will unlock new economic models for developers and marketplaces while enabling consumer incentives only possible via programmable dollars,” McMaster says. Finally, Bridge CEO Zach Abrams notes that financial access tends to be a barrier to gaming, despite it being a global community. Abrams says that Bridge will power “seamless entry and exit points for Game Dollar” to make “digital economies more inclusive for players and radically simpler for developers. They get a stable, ready-to-use payments infrastructure that takes care of compliance and enables a global reach out of the box.” You might also like Stripe to Launch USD Stablecoin for Global Markets Beyond US, UK, and Europe The post Playtron Reveals M0-Powered ‘Game Dollar’ Stablecoin for Gaming Payments appeared first on Cryptonews .",Blockchain News|Gaming|Stablecoin|SUI,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|FIAT|SPONSORED|ZRX|SUI,"{'name': 'cryptonews', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptonews.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptonews,2025-05-02 10:11:27

By adopting Strategy’s model , TBG has redefined capital allocation, positioning itself at the forefront of Europe’s Bitcoin-native financial revolution. From Tech Firm to Bitcoin Treasury Originally a tech company, TBG pivoted in 2023 to become a Bitcoin-first firm. The company divested most of its previous projects to focus on two primary areas: web and blockchain development, and data and AI consulting. In December 2023, a new leadership team took charge, initiating the shift toward a Bitcoin-centered strategy. By November 2024, TBG officially transformed into a Bitcoin Treasury Company. 1/ The #1 performing stock in Paris over the last 6 months isn’t a tech giant—it’s a #Bitcoin treasury company. @_ALTBG is compounding BTC per share with ruthless efficiency—709.8% BTC Yield in 6 months. Let’s dive in: pic.twitter.com/m16rXoXJSZ — Bitcoin For Corporations (@BitcoinForCorps) May 1, 2025 TBG’s unique approach to capital raises sets it apart. Rather than diluting their value, the company sold shares at higher-than-market prices and used the proceeds to acquire Bitcoin. This strategy allowed TBG to increase its BTC holdings per share, effectively turning itself into a “Bitcoin factory.” Measuring Success Through BTC Yield Rather than focusing solely on Bitcoin’s price fluctuations , TBG measures success by its BTC yield—the amount of Bitcoin added per share. This strategy has paid off significantly, with TBG’s BTC per share value surging by over 709.8% in less than six months, even without a significant spike in Bitcoin’s price . TBG’s bold strategy has gained support from prominent figures in the crypto industry. Blockstream CEO Adam Back, Fulgur Ventures, UTXO Management, and TOBAM are among those backing the company. Some have made direct investments, while others have forged partnership agreements. These endorsements bring not just capital, but trust and credibility, positioning TBG as a leader in the Bitcoin-focused investment space. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Top 8 Bitcoin Price Predictions for 2025 from Institutions You Can’t Miss , TBG’s Financial Model: Equity, BTC Bonds & Warrants TBG utilizes three main financial tools to raise capital: Premium Equity : The company raises funds by selling shares at above-market prices, avoiding share dilution. BTC-Denominated Bonds : TBG borrows funds in BTC terms, matching its debt with Bitcoin assets. Warrants : Investors can benefit from TBG’s growth by receiving warrants, offering an upside if the company performs well. Currently holding 620 BTC, valued at $59.8 million, TBG plans to significantly expand its holdings. According to Nick Ward, the company aims to accumulate between 21,000 and 42,000 BTC within five years, with a long-term target of controlling at least 1% of the total Bitcoin supply by 2033. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

Under the new Anti-Money Laundering Regulation (AMLR), credit institutions, financial institutions and crypto asset service providers (CASPs) will be prohibited from maintaining anonymous accounts or handling privacy-preserving cryptocurrencies, such as Monero ( XMR ) and Zcash ( ZEC ). “Article 79 of the AMLR establishes strict prohibitions on anonymous accounts [...]. Credit institutions, financial institutions, and crypto-asset service providers are prohibited from maintaining anonymous accounts,” according to the AML Handbook, published by European Crypto Initiative (EUCI). The AML Handbook. Source: EUCI The regulation is part of a broader AML framework that includes bank and payment accounts, passbooks and safe-deposit boxes, “crypto-asset accounts allowing anonymisation of transactions,” and “accounts using anonymity-enhancing coins.” Related: Eric Trump: USD1 will be used for $2B MGX investment in Binance “The regulations (the AMLR, AMLD and AMLAR) are final, and what remains is the ‘fine print’ — aka the interpretation of some of the requirements through the so-called implementing and delegated acts,” according to Vyara Savova, senior policy lead at the EUCI. She added that much of the implementation will come through so-called implementing and delegated acts, which are mostly handled by the European Banking Authority: “This means that the EUCI is still actively working on these level two acts by providing feedback to the public consultations, as some of the implementation details are yet to be finalized.” “However, the broader framework is final, so centralized crypto projects (CASPs under MiCA) need to keep it in mind when determining their internal processes and policies,” Savova said. Related: Bitcoin volatility lowest in 563 days, Hayes predicts $1M BTC by 2028 EU to increase oversight of crypto service providers Under the new regulatory framework, CASPs operating in at least six member states will be under direct AML supervision. In the initial stage, AMLA plans to select 40 entities, with at least one entity per member state, according to EUCI’s AML Handbook. The selection process is set to start on July 1, 2027. AMLA will use “materiality thresholds” to ensure that only firms with “substantial operations presence in multiple jurisdictions are considered for direct supervision.” The thresholds include a “minimum of 20,000 customers residing in the host member state,” or a total transaction volume of over 50 million euros ($56 million). Other notable measures include mandatory customer due diligence on transactions above 1,000 euros ($1,100). These updates come as the EU ramps up its regulatory oversight of the crypto industry, building on previous measures such as the Markets in Crypto-Assets Regulation (MiCA).

Some say MUTM is doing what XRP did in its early days,https://invezz.com/news/2025/05/02/best-crypto-to-buy-now-under-0-15-some-say-mutm-is-doing-what-xrp-did-in-its-early-days/,"In today’s market, spotting a cryptocurrency with real-world use and early-stage access isn’t easy — especially one priced well below $0.15. But a growing number of investors believe they’ve found it in Mutuum Finance (MUTM), a DeFi-focused protocol that’s gaining attention for its substance, not speculation. As many recall, XRP spent its early days quietly building infrastructure before it saw wider adoption and a massive price shift. Similarly, Mutuum isn’t aiming for quick headlines. Instead, it’s structuring a long-term ecosystem built around utility, access, and sustainable growth — a model that’s catching the eye of those searching for the best crypto to buy now. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Mutuum Finance is currently running its presale with the token priced at $0.025 — and demand is rising fast. So far, the project has already secured more than 9,300 holders, sold over 440 million tokens, and raised upwards of $7.5 million. For a crypto investment still in development, those figures reflect significant early interest. At its core, the platform is being developed to support non-custodial lending and borrowing, giving users the ability to earn passive income, deploy capital, and access liquidity while retaining ownership of their assets. When participants deposit supported cryptocurrencies, they receive mtTokens — digital representations of their pool contribution, which automatically accrue value based on lending activity. Mutuum isn’t trying to replicate meme coin momentum or mimic the inflationary strategies of short-term projects. Instead, it’s positioning itself as a long-term player in decentralized finance, which continues to be one of the fastest-growing segments in the crypto market. The protocol will eventually include both Peer-to-Contract and Peer-to-Peer models, giving flexibility for users who want to supply assets into shared liquidity pools or arrange terms directly with other users. But what sets it apart is how revenue from the platform is reinvested back into the ecosystem, with a portion used to buy MUTM on the open market — reinforcing token demand and returning value to the community. It’s this real-economy model that’s attracting attention from investors who previously focused on larger cap assets like ADA or XRP. They’re not just looking for the next big name — they’re looking for the next big crypto with real function and room to grow. What makes the current presale entry point so compelling is the built-in upside. While MUTM is now available for $0.025, the confirmed launch price is set at $0.06. That’s a 2.4x return already built in for those who join before the token hits exchanges. However, many believe that’s only the beginning. Analysts watching the project say the token is positioned to rise well beyond its launch price shortly after going live — especially with major exchange listings, increased visibility, and early user activity expected to boost demand. This kind of crypto prediction has been gaining traction among those hunting for undervalued altcoins with high upside. Let’s say someone purchases around 60,000 MUTM tokens today for $1,500. At the $0.06 listing price, that already places the value at $3,600. If the token continues its post-launch climb, that figure rises accordingly — showing how early positioning translates into clear potential upside. Mutuum Finance is hitting key milestones quickly. The presale is accelerating, its architecture is being built around transparent and sustainable DeFi mechanics, and the team plans to roll out a beta version of the platform by the time the token goes live — ensuring new users can engage with the product from day one. It’s this mix of early access, real-world application, and product readiness that’s placing MUTM on shortlists of top cryptocurrencies to watch, especially for those looking to diversify into affordable tokens that aren’t just promising utility — they’re already showing it. While the broader market speculates on where the next breakout may come from, MUTM continues building quietly — and quickly. With a capped presale price and confirmed listings ahead, it may not stay under the radar much longer for those exploring what crypto to invest in before the next market rally.

44065356,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=154559,1746186053,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,"Asian FX Surges as China Trade Hopes Boost Currencies, US Dollar Dips",https://bitcoinworld.co.in/asian-fx-surges-trade/,"In the world of finance, everything is connected. From stock markets to commodities, and yes, even cryptocurrencies, global macroeconomic shifts play a significant role. Today, we’re looking at a notable movement in the traditional Forex market , specifically how Asian FX is gaining ground while the US Dollar is experiencing a slight pullback. This dynamic is being driven by two key factors: optimism surrounding potential China trade talks and anticipation ahead of crucial US economic data, the Nonfarm Payrolls report. For cryptocurrency enthusiasts and investors, understanding these broader market movements is essential. Currency strength and global economic sentiment can influence capital flows and risk appetite, indirectly impacting the crypto landscape. Let’s break down what’s happening and why it matters. Why is Asian FX Rallying? Several Asian currencies have seen positive momentum recently. This rally isn’t happening in a vacuum; it’s largely a response to improving sentiment regarding global trade relations. When there’s hope for reduced trade tensions, particularly between major economic powers, it tends to benefit currencies tied to trade-reliant economies, many of which are in Asia. Here’s a quick look at the factors supporting this rally: Trade Optimism: Rumors and reports suggesting progress or a willingness to engage in constructive dialogue between the US and China are boosting confidence. Improved Risk Sentiment: When global risks (like trade wars) appear to recede, investors are more willing to invest in assets perceived as riskier but offering higher potential returns, including emerging market currencies. Economic Recovery Hopes: Positive trade developments can signal a healthier global economy, which is favorable for Asian export-oriented nations. This collective positive sentiment is translating into stronger performance for various currencies across the Asian region. What’s Happening with the US Dollar ? While Asian currencies gain, the US Dollar has softened. The dollar often acts as a safe-haven currency; when global uncertainty rises, investors flock to the dollar. Conversely, when optimism increases and risk sentiment improves, demand for safe havens like the dollar tends to decrease. The dip in the dollar is also heavily influenced by anticipation of upcoming economic data, especially the Nonfarm Payrolls report. Traders are adjusting positions, waiting to see if the data confirms or challenges expectations about the US economy’s health and the Federal Reserve’s future policy decisions. The Impact of Potential China Trade Talks The prospect of renewed or productive China trade talks is a major catalyst for current market movements. The trade relationship between the US and China significantly impacts global supply chains, economic growth forecasts, and investor confidence. Any sign of de-escalation or progress can trigger shifts in currency valuations. Consider the potential outcomes: Scenario Likely Impact on Asian FX Likely Impact on US Dollar Talks lead to agreement/de-escalation Positive (currencies strengthen) Negative (safe-haven demand falls) Talks stall or fail Negative (currencies weaken) Positive (safe-haven demand rises) Status Quo (no major news) Limited impact (focus shifts to data) Limited impact (focus shifts to data) The current market movement reflects the hope that the first scenario is becoming more probable, even if cautiously. Anticipating the Nonfarm Payrolls Report Beyond trade, the upcoming Nonfarm Payrolls (NFP) report from the US is a critical event for the Forex market , particularly for the US Dollar . This monthly report details the number of people employed in the US (excluding farm employees and some government workers). It’s a key indicator of the health of the US labor market, which in turn influences inflation expectations and the Federal Reserve’s monetary policy decisions. Why is NFP so important? Indicator of Economic Health: Strong job growth suggests a robust economy. Inflationary Pressure: A tight labor market can lead to wage increases, potentially fueling inflation. Fed Policy Clues: The Federal Reserve watches NFP closely to guide decisions on interest rates. Strong data might support arguments for higher rates or delaying cuts, while weak data could suggest the opposite. Traders are positioning themselves based on their expectations for this report, causing the dollar to react even before the official release. Navigating the Current Forex Market Landscape The current environment in the Forex market is a mix of optimism (trade talks) and anticipation (economic data). This creates volatility but also potential opportunities for those who understand the drivers. Key Takeaways: Asian FX is benefiting from improved global risk sentiment tied to trade hopes. The US Dollar is facing pressure as safe-haven demand eases and traders await NFP data. China trade talks remain a significant, albeit uncertain, factor influencing sentiment. The Nonfarm Payrolls report is the next major event that could dictate the dollar’s direction and impact the broader market. For anyone involved in global markets, including crypto, keeping an eye on these traditional market signals provides valuable context. They highlight the interconnectedness of the global financial system. In Conclusion: The current rally in Asian FX and the dip in the US Dollar reflect a market caught between positive trade signals and the looming uncertainty of key economic data. While China trade talks offer a glimmer of hope, the upcoming Nonfarm Payrolls report holds the potential to reshape expectations and drive the next major move in the Forex market . Staying informed about these macro events is crucial for navigating the broader financial landscape.

On May 1, the US Treasury Department’s Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) said Huione had become a “critical node” for moving illicit funds linked to DPRK cyber heists and large-scale scams like pig butchering. As such, the agency has proposed a rule that would block American banks from maintaining any accounts on behalf of the group, effectively severing its access to US correspondent banking. The move, FinCEN added, is aimed at degrading Huione’s ability to help malicious actors “secure revenue from or for their criminal schemes.” In an accompanying statement, Treasury Scott Bessent was quoted as saying: Today’s proposed action will sever Huione Group’s access to correspondent banking, degrading these groups’ ability to launder their ill-gotten gains. Treasury remains committed to disrupting any attempt by malicious cyber actors to secure revenue from or for their criminal schemes. The proposed rule is currently open to public comment for 30 days before it can be finalised and enforced. What is the Huione Group? Huione Group is a Cambodian business conglomerate that runs a mix of financial and tech services. At the centre of it is Huione Pay, a payment platform, along with Huione Crypto, a virtual asset exchange, and most notably, a Telegram-based marketplace called Huione Guarantee, now rebranded as Haowang Guarantee. The group also has political ties. One of the directors of Huione Pay is reportedly Hun To, a cousin of Cambodian Prime Minister Hun Manet. Past investigations have linked Hun To to serious allegations, including money laundering and heroin trafficking, although no formal charges have emerged from those reports. Huione Guarantee, the group’s Telegram-based platform, became notorious for hosting thousands of channels offering services to cybercriminals. According to blockchain forensic firm Elliptic, it functions like a darknet marketplace, but on a publicly accessible domain. Vendors on the platform have been found selling scam website templates, stolen data, fake IDs, and even training on how to run investment frauds. The platform has also been linked to disturbing reports of human trafficking and abuse at so-called scam compounds in Southeast Asia. Elliptic’s research found that crypto wallets tied to the group and its merchants had received over $11 billion since 2021, most of it suspected to be tied to illicit activity. Meanwhile, FinCEN, in its May 1 proposal, estimated that Huione Group laundered at least $4 billion in illicit funds between August 2021 and January 2025, including funds tied to North Korean cyber heists and crypto investment scams . As previously reported by Invezz, on-chain investigator ZachXBT traced part of the funds stolen in last year’s hack of Japanese crypto exchange DMM to a wallet linked to Huione Group. Past actions against Huione group In response to mounting scrutiny, tech platforms and crypto firms have started to act. Google pulled Huione’s mobile app from the Play Store in January 2025 after reports of criminal activity, though the app still remains available on Apple’s App Store. Back in July 2024, Tether froze nearly $30 million in USDT linked to Huione’s accounts, reportedly triggering the launch of the group’s own stablecoin, USDH. The coin, pegged to the US dollar, was designed in a way that made it difficult to freeze or trace, allowing bad actors to bypass traditional oversight.

Pseudonymous analyst Altcoin Sherpa tells his 245,300 followers on the social media platform X that the utility token of the decentralized open financial system Hyperliquid ( HYPE ) may increase 150% from its current value as it prints a bullish pattern on the daily chart. “Bought a small HYPE perp position [April 30th]; not sure how long I’ll hold for. Still one of the best utility coins and projects out there and it’s slowly grinding higher. Wouldn’t be surprised to see this go to $50 or something if BTC [and] trading conditions remain healthy.” Source: Altcoin Sherpa/X HYPE is trading at $20.10 at time of writing, up 6.3% in the last 24 hours. The analyst also suggests that traditional four-year crypto cycles are likely over, and alts may start following a different price pattern. The four-year cycle is based on the idea that crypto follows Bitcoin’s halvings when BTC miners’ rewards are cut in half, which happen roughly every four years and tend to precede upward price movements. “No more four-year cycles where coins have to go through two years of accumulation like before, in my opinion. I think we’re going to just see extreme moves to the upside and downside from here on out (in anywhere from three-six months time). Alts will go 50%-90% down and then do a few x after.” Follow us on X , Facebook and Telegram Don't Miss a Beat – Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox Check Price Action Surf The Daily Hodl Mix Disclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

Despite concerns surrounding President Donald Trump’s protectionist trade policies, Roubini now predicts a healthy 4% growth by 2030. He attributes this to the United States’ dominance in key technological sectors, including AI, robotics, and quantum computing. Roubini’s Optimism Amidst Tariff Worries While Roubini acknowledges the potential short-term challenges posed by Trump’s tariffs, he believes the strength of the U.S. economy, supported by technological innovation and robust institutional structures, will ultimately prevail. He points out that the U.S. holds a competitive advantage in 10 out of 12 sectors likely to influence future economic trends, with China leading only in green projects and electric vehicles. These technological strengths are expected to balance the negative impacts of trade conflicts. Mixed Reactions from Cathie Wood and Robert Kiyosaki Roubini’s unexpected change in outlook has sparked mixed reactions, particularly from the cryptocurrency world. Cathie Wood, CEO of ARK Invest , disagrees with Roubini’s predictions, arguing that such conditions may lead to inflation. Wood believes that continued technological progress, combined with stricter monetary policies, will result in deflation over time. Meanwhile, fintech writer Robert Kiyosaki forecasts potential hyperinflation in the U.S. , citing global economic changes such as BRICS nations exploring a gold-backed stablecoin. Kiyosaki suggests this could undermine the U.S. dollar’s dominance and lead to significant inflationary pressures. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Joseph Stiglitz Slams Trump Crypto Policies, Warns of Tax Evasion Risks , In a Nutshell Roubini’s statement indicates that, despite the challenges posed by Trump’s trade policies in the first quarter, the U.S. economy is poised to recover. While mixed reactions are expected from the crypto community, Roubini’s shift in perspective has drawn attention. As complex tariff policies continue to influence U.S. economic growth, it remains to be seen whether Roubini’s 4% growth prediction will come to fruition. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

Here Are the Details,https://en.bitcoinsistemi.com/dogecoin-and-xrp-etf-excitement-social-media-trends-positive-on-possible-etf-approval-here-are-the-details/,"Investors are growing optimistic about the potential approval of spot exchange-traded funds (ETFs) for Dogecoin (DOGE) and XRP, with sentiment indicators and social media trends suggesting a resumption of bullish momentum for both tokens. Dogecoin and XRP ETF Excitement Fuels Bullish Momentum According to blockchain analytics platform Santiment, social media chatter regarding DOGE and XRP has increased in recent days, with the tone of discussions turning noticeably positive. The shift reflects rising hopes that U.S. regulators will approve spot ETFs for the two digital assets, a move that could further boost their legitimacy in the eyes of institutional and individual investors. According to prediction market platform Polymarket, the probability of a spot XRP ETF being approved by the end of 2025 has jumped to 85% from 65% just two months ago. Despite the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) delaying its decisions on both DOGE and XRP ETF applications until June 17, market participants remain optimistic. Technical charts are also showing accumulation trends, indicating strong investor interest amid the current market downturn. DOGE, in particular, experienced a dramatic comeback on social media after 21Shares and Bitwise filed for DOGE spot ETFs in April. Santiment noted that DOGE’s dominance on social media has reached a three-month high, reflecting the community’s growing belief that the token’s “meme coin” status could translate into a more serious investment story. “Support for ETF proposals from groups like House of Doge and the Dogecoin Foundation has helped DOGE transcend its meme origins, increasing its credibility,” Santiment wrote in its latest update. While XRP’s social media discussion volume remains low relative to other leading assets, sentiment remains overwhelmingly bullish, with investors closely watching to see how clarification of XRP’s legal status could boost its chances of ETF approval following Ripple’s partial victory over the SEC last year. The data highlights the increasing importance of social trends and investor sentiment in driving near-term momentum, especially for tokens on the verge of wider institutional recognition. *This is not investment advice.

44065684,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=154560,1746186656,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Shocking SEC Drops Crypto Lawsuit Against Ian Balina,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/sec-drops-ian-balina-lawsuit/,"In a surprising turn of events that has sent ripples through the digital asset community, the SEC has moved to dismiss its high-profile Crypto Lawsuit against prominent Crypto Influencer , Ian Balina. This development, revealed in a recent court filing, marks a significant moment in the ongoing saga of regulatory oversight in the crypto space. What Led to the SEC Crypto Lawsuit Against Ian Balina? To understand the significance of the dismissal, it’s crucial to look back at the origins of the case. The SEC initially filed suit against Ian Balina in 2022. The core of the commission’s complaint revolved around Balina’s promotion of Sparkster ‘s unregistered offering of SPRK tokens in 2018. The SEC alleged that Balina failed to disclose compensation received from Sparkster for promoting the tokens and also conducted his own offering of SPRK tokens without registration. At the time, the lawsuit against a well-known Crypto Influencer like Balina was seen as a clear signal from the SEC that it intended to pursue individuals promoting unregistered securities, not just the issuers themselves. This approach aimed to bring greater accountability to the often-murky world of initial coin offerings (ICOs) and token promotions. The Sparkster Token and the Court’s Ruling A key backdrop to the Ian Balina case was the fate of the Sparkster token offering itself. In a separate legal action, the SEC pursued Sparkster and its CEO. In 2024, a U.S. court indeed ruled that the SPRK tokens offered by Sparkster met the definition of an investment contract under U.S. securities law, specifically applying the Howey Test criteria. This ruling validated the SEC ‘s assertion that the token offering was an unregistered securities sale. However, the court’s finding regarding the nature of the token did not automatically determine Balina’s liability. His case centered on his specific actions: promoting the token without disclosure and allegedly selling tokens himself. The path from proving the token was a security to proving Balina violated specific laws in his promotion and sales proved to be a complex legal challenge. Why Did the SEC Seek Dismissal? The motion to dismiss the lawsuit against Ian Balina , filed on May 1st, has sparked considerable discussion. While the filing itself might cite procedural reasons or strategic considerations, the broader context suggests several potential factors: Shifting Enforcement Priorities: The filing mentioned the SEC’s Crypto Task Force. Regulatory bodies often re-evaluate ongoing litigation based on evolving priorities, resource allocation, and strategic goals. Legal Hurdles: Despite the ruling on the Sparkster token itself, the SEC may have faced challenges proving the specific allegations against Balina to the required legal standard, particularly concerning his intent or the precise nature of his promotional activities and token sales. Broader Regulatory Landscape: The current environment surrounding crypto regulation in the U.S. is highly dynamic. This dismissal could align with a broader re-evaluation of enforcement strategies under the current administration, potentially favoring actions against issuers or platforms over individual promoters, especially in older cases. Resource Management: Pursuing complex litigation requires significant resources. The SEC may be prioritizing newer cases or those deemed to have a greater impact on market integrity. This move is particularly notable when viewed alongside other instances where the SEC has faced setbacks or withdrawn actions in the crypto realm, including prominent cases involving major players like Coinbase and Ripple, although the circumstances of each case differ significantly. What Does This Mean for Crypto Influencer s? The dismissal of the SEC Crypto Lawsuit against Ian Balina offers a moment of relief for Balina, but its implications for the broader landscape of Crypto Influencer s remain complex. While it shows that the SEC may not pursue every single promoter, it absolutely does not give influencers a free pass. Key Takeaways for Influencers: Disclosure is Paramount: The original core issue of failing to disclose compensation remains a major red flag for regulators. Future enforcement actions are likely to heavily scrutinize whether influencers are transparent about paid promotions. Understanding the Asset: Influencers promoting tokens still face risks if those tokens are deemed unregistered securities. Promoting such assets, especially without proper due diligence, can lead to legal troubles. Evolving Regulatory Focus: While this specific case was dismissed, the regulatory environment is tightening globally. Influencers need to stay informed about rules regarding advertising, financial promotion, and securities laws in the jurisdictions where they operate and where their audience resides. Seek Legal Counsel: Anyone involved in promoting crypto assets should consult with legal experts familiar with securities and advertising laws. The case serves as a stark reminder that promoting financial products, including crypto assets, comes with significant responsibilities and potential legal liabilities. The Bigger Picture: SEC Enforcement Trends The decision to drop the Ian Balina lawsuit is being interpreted by some as part of a broader trend in SEC enforcement under the current administration. While the agency continues to bring cases against crypto firms for alleged violations, there appears to be a more cautious approach or a strategic shift in certain areas compared to previous years. Cases like those involving Ripple and Coinbase have highlighted the legal challenges the SEC faces in applying existing securities laws to novel crypto structures. The outcomes of these cases, along with internal strategic reviews by the Crypto Task Force, likely influence which battles the SEC chooses to fight and how. This doesn’t signal a retreat from crypto oversight, but perhaps a refinement of strategy, potentially focusing on larger platforms, significant unregistered offerings, or cases with clearer evidence of fraud or direct harm to investors. The regulatory environment remains uncertain, but these recent developments provide valuable data points on the direction the SEC might be heading. Conclusion: A Moment of Clarity, But Uncertainty Remains The dismissal of the SEC Crypto Lawsuit against Ian Balina is undoubtedly a significant event for the individual involved and offers a case study in the complexities of crypto regulation. It highlights the legal challenges the SEC faces and hints at potential shifts in its enforcement strategy, possibly influenced by the outcomes of other high-profile cases and evolving priorities. For the broader crypto market and especially for Crypto Influencer s, the takeaway is not that regulation is disappearing, but that its application is continuously being tested and refined in the courts. Transparency, diligence, and awareness of legal obligations remain essential for anyone operating in this dynamic space. While this specific chapter closes for Balina, the larger story of how regulators will shape the future of crypto continues to unfold.

Trading volume on the platform, rose 29% year-over-year, and funded accounts grew by 26%, while assets on the platform dropped 2% to $34.9 billion.

More than an expansion of our business, this strategic acquisition strengthens our position in derivatives for both TradFi services and crypto,” the exchange wrote in a report.

According to a chart shared on April 30, 2025, the analyst points to the development of what he calls a “MACRO Channel,” which has historically dictated XRP’s movement across multiple market cycles. The channel spans from below $0.10 to upwards of $12, with a projected breakout potentially pushing XRP between $17 and $55 in the coming months or years. #XRP – MACRO Channel ($17-$55) : We're currently in Candle number 5, and if history is any guide, we could be looking at a MEGA Monthly Candle! Following the same pattern, the target of $17 is definitely in play. Now, let’s discuss the MACRO Channel breakout. The measured… pic.twitter.com/Qu7tYGG0fJ — EGRAG CRYPTO (@egragcrypto) April 30, 2025 The analysis indicates that XRP is in the fifth monthly candle following a breakout from the channel’s lower boundary, echoing a similar six-candle formation observed during a prior bullish cycle. In the historical case, the sixth candle produced a substantial move to the upside. If this pattern continues, EGRAG suggests XRP may soon print what he terms a “MEGA Monthly Candle,” potentially targeting $17 as a near-term price level. Measured Move Indicates High of $55 Possible EGRAG outlines a technical rationale for his projections based on the measured move following the breakout from the upper trendline of the MACRO Channel. Using this method, he calculates a potential upside target as high as $55. This figure represents a long-term projection based on historical symmetry and channel dimensions. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Though $55 is identified as the maximum range of the breakout, the analyst clarifies his personal approach to the potential rally. He states that he will begin gradually selling his position at around $27 , emphasizing the importance of profit-taking as XRP’s price progresses through various levels. This is meant to mitigate risk while taking advantage of speculative gains. Current Price Action and Indicators At the time of the chart’s publication, XRP was trading around $2.22. The chart shows a historical resistance line near $3.41 and a previously significant pivot level at $3.40. These price points are considered intermediate targets XRP would breach to confirm momentum toward higher figures like $17, $27, or $55. The 21-month exponential moving average (EMA), plotted in yellow, is trending upward and acting as dynamic support within the MACRO Channel. EGRAG notes that XRP has remained within this MACRO Channel since approximately 2017, consolidating between the mid and upper boundaries. The observed appears structurally similar to previous surges, providing historical support for the ongoing move. The visual data shows a previous six-candle lead-up into a significant bull run, and the current five-candle structure is shaping up similarly. Long-Term Outlook and Community Encouragement In his message to the XRP community , EGRAG concludes by urging holders to remain “steady and strong,” stating, “Together We RISE.” While reinforcing his long-standing bullish stance on XRP, he acknowledges that his strategy involves phased selling rather than holding indefinitely through all projected levels.

44066512,https://invezz.com/?p=2701826,1746186862,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/69/default.png,Which crypto will reach $1 first: DOGE or MUTM with real ecosystem growth?,https://invezz.com/news/2025/05/02/which-crypto-will-reach-1-first-doge-or-mutm-with-real-ecosystem-growth/,"The race to the $1 milestone has become a symbolic benchmark for many cryptocurrencies, but not every token has a realistic shot at hitting it. While Dogecoin (DOGE) has been the face of viral crypto moments, it’s Mutuum Finance (MUTM) that’s now drawing serious attention from investors focused on fundamentals. With clear tokenomics, rising traction, and utility-driven design, MUTM may be the more grounded candidate to cross that threshold first. Dogecoin is widely known, but most of its momentum comes from past media buzz and social media waves. I t has no cap on supply, no ecosystem utility to support ongoing demand, and relies heavily on community sentiment. That formula has led to dramatic rallies in the past, but sustaining long-term price growth is a different challenge. On the other hand, MUTM is backed by a functioning protocol in development, focused on non-custodial lending and borrowing. Instead of hoping for another meme cycle, Mutuum is building a practical DeFi platform. Users will have the ability to contribute digital assets, generate ongoing yield, and tap into available liquidity — all without giving up ownership of their funds. Why MUTM is attracting investors Mutuum Finance remains in its presale stage, and interest around the project continues to build rapidly. Over 9,300 holders are already participating, more than 440 million tokens have been sold, and total funds raised exceed $7.5 million. These figures aren’t driven by hype — they demonstrate genuine momentum ahead of the project’s official launch. MUTM is presently priced at $0.025 during presale, with its official launch price locked in at $0.06. That’s a built-in 2.4x return for early participants. As the next phase will raise the token price to $0.03, those looking to enter at the current lowest price have only a short window left. What’s more, projections suggest that once listed, MUTM could climb significantly above the $0.06 launch price in a short span. When the token reaches $1 — which represents a 3,900% gain from current levels — early buyers will be in a powerful position. For anyone doing serious crypto investment planning, this kind of upside is hard to ignore. The strength of Mutuum’s potential lies in its design. The protocol will include both Peer-to-Contract (P2C) and Peer-to-Peer (P2P) models. This means users can either deposit into shared liquidity pools or negotiate loan terms directly with others. mtTokens — received when users deposit assets — reflect accrued interest and can be used to maintain liquidity or reinvest. In parallel, the team is developing a stablecoin backed by on-chain collateral, offering another layer of utility and ecosystem value. As adoption increases, so does transaction volume and platform revenue — some of which will be used to support token value through buyback and redistribution to active users. DOGE vs. MUTM: who gets there first? DOGE still has cultural relevance, but its lack of fundamental utility continues to limit its ability to grow sustainably. In contrast, MUTM is aligning its price growth with product rollout, community expansion, and token economics that reward real participation. For those asking what crypto to buy now with long-term potential, MUTM is making a strong impression as the next big crypto. With presale phases already progressing and launch infrastructure in motion, MUTM is positioned for a major run — one that’s based on more than sentiment. Investors who missed early entries into projects like ADA or other utility-backed assets are starting to see MUTM as a fresh chance. The crypto space moves fast — and the $1 race may soon be decided by real adoption, not memes. MUTM is priced at just $0.025, with the next phase and official listing drawing closer. As more investors join and the ecosystem launches, it’s no longer a question of if demand will increase — but how soon. For investors seeking a top cryptocurrency with real utility and a product-driven roadmap, MUTM is emerging as a compelling option. DOGE has left its mark on the market, but the spotlight is shifting toward platforms with real substance — and Mutuum is actively building just that. Driven by real utility, MUTM is rapidly emerging as one of the most discussed cryptocurrencies to consider before the next market cycle gains momentum.

On March 21, South Korean regulators ordered Google Play to block access to exchanges that were not compliant with the requirements needed to operate in the country. On April 11, South Korea’s Financial Services Commission (FSC) ordered the Apple Store to block unregistered crypto exchanges . KuCoin was among those affected by the country’s crackdown on unregistered platforms that were previously available. While the platform is now unavailable to South Koreans, it has not fully abandoned the jurisdiction. In an exclusive interview with Cointelegraph, KuCoin’s newly appointed CEO, BC Wong, said that the crypto exchange has plans to reenter the country. Wong (left), KuCoin EU CEO Oliver Stauber (middle) and Cointelegraph reporter Ezra Reguerra (right) at the Token2049 event in Dubai. Source: Market Across Regulators drive global players away from local markets Wong told Cointelegraph that before the exchange can reenter South Korea, it plans to secure compliance with major jurisdictions first. He said: “The resource is there. We need to go one by one. Our strategy will always be that major jurisdictions come first, which means the United States, EU, China, India, and maybe after that, Australia.” Wong confirmed to Cointelegraph that KuCoin representatives had started speaking with regulators. The executive said that operating in crypto is very similar to traditional financial markets, where there’s a need for a clear background in each jurisdiction. The KuCoin CEO also said that regulators are stricter compared to three years ago. He said that this could be a move to drive global players away from local crypto markets. “I'm not so sure that if the regulators’ intention is to regulate the global market or just simply, they want to pave the way to get all the global kind of players to be out from their market, and pave the road for their domestic exchange,” Wong added. Related: Kraken tells how it spotted North Korean hacker in job interview KuCoin’s EU CEO shares regulatory challenges in Europe Oliver Stauber, who joined KuCoin as its European Union CEO, told Cointelegraph that there are also difficulties operating in the EU, even with the bloc’s Markets in Crypto-Assets Regulation (MiCA ) in place. Stauber, who previously worked as the chief legal officer of Bitpanda, told Cointelegraph that while MiCA licenses have a passporting feature, which should allow license holders to provide services across the EU, the executive said that some jurisdictions interpret the laws differently. Stauber said that some jurisdictions may say that licenses were “wrongly assessed,” which gets in the way of operating in some jurisdictions. “MiCA was said to have a level playing field in crypto all over Europe. However, as long as there are players who are not playing by the books, you know it's getting quite messy and difficult,” Stauber told Cointelegraph.

As Bitcoin ( BTC ) price trades within the $96,350 to $97,180 range, OpenAI ’s flagship large language model (LLM), ChatGPT4-o, put forth three distinct price targets for May 30 when queried by Finbold. At press time on May 2, Bitcoin was trading at $96,910, following a decisive move above the $90,000 level on April 22 accompanied by significant capital inflows . BTC price 1-week chart. Source: Finbold According to the artificial intelligence ( AI ) model, a bullish scenario which would see strong exchange-traded fund ( ETF ) demand, interest rate cuts, and a general improvement in macroeconomic conditions could see the price of Bitcoin rise to $112,000 to $122,000 by May 30, which would equate to a 15.57% to 25.89% rally from current prices. On the other hand, a neutral scenario, characterized by sideways movement, steady demand, and a lack of clear catalysts, either bullish or bearish , could see BTC prices either drop to as low as $93,000, which would represent a 4.03% loss, or rise as high as $102,000, for a surge of up to 5.25%. BTC price predictions. Source: OpenAI Lastly, ChatGPT-4o predicted that weak crypto inflows, rising yields, and investors reducing their exposure to risky assets could cause a drop in BTC price to levels in the $78,000 to $88,000 range, which implies a loss of 19.51% to 9.19%.

Several key factors are aligning to ignite a powerful market rally: the institutional interest in crypto assets continues to rise, and regulatory clarity is slowly improving in major economies. Combined with growing enthusiasm for decentralized finance (DeFi), AI integration, and memecoin culture, the stage is set for explosive growth across the crypto market. However, not all memecoins are positioned to ride this wave. While Dogecoin (DOGE) and Shiba Inu (SHIB) once captured the world’s imagination with viral marketing and celebrity endorsements, their momentum has stalled. DOGE lacks a clear development roadmap beyond its meme appeal, and SHIB’s ecosystem, though expanded, struggles to generate sustained user adoption. Both have matured into large-cap tokens, limiting their upside potential compared to their early days. The next moonshot opportunity could be an emerging project such as Codename:Pepe that merges meme culture with AI technology. It offers real-world utility beyond hype. With a smaller market cap, strong community engagement, innovative tokenomics, and strategic use of AI-driven trend analysis, Codename:Pepe has the perfect recipe for a breakout year.

Early birds get the juiciest rewards. Don’t be the one to join the race later. The mission is active. The presale is live. Are you in — or will you let the fake AIs take the win? Shiba Inu price sees strong weekly gains Shiba Inu (SHIB) has experienced a positive trend over the past week. The price increased by 11.96%, showing strong momentum. Over the past month, the coin’s price rose by 9.40%. However, looking at the past six months, SHIB’s price has decreased by 24.65%. The current price ranges between $0.0000119967 and $0.0000150667. The nearest resistance level is at $0.0000166933. If the price moves above this level, it could indicate further upward movement. The nearest support level is at $0.0000105533. If the price drops below this point, it might signal a potential downtrend. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) for SHIB is 56.17. An RSI above 50 suggests that buying pressure is stronger than selling pressure. This could mean that the price may continue to rise in the short term. Based on the recent weekly and monthly gains, SHIB shows potential for continued growth. However, the six-month decrease suggests that the coin is still recovering from earlier losses. Monitoring the support and resistance levels could provide insight into the coin’s future price movements. Dogecoin gains momentum with 12% weekly surge Dogecoin’s price has seen a significant boost, increasing by 12.55% over the past week. The current price ranges between $0.1583 and $0.1964. This upward trend indicates growing interest from investors and could signal further gains ahead. Over the past month, Dogecoin’s price has risen by 5.84%. In the past six months, it has increased by 6.346%. These consistent gains suggest a steady growth pattern. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) stands at 51.58, indicating a neutral position but leaning towards bullish momentum. The nearest resistance level is at $0.2136. If Dogecoin breaks through this point, it could climb higher. The nearest support level is at $0.1376, which seems less likely to be tested given the current upward trend. Based on the recent data, Dogecoin’s price may continue to rise. The consistent percentage increases over various time frames support this outlook. Investors might watch for the resistance level at $0.2136 as a potential milestone in Dogecoin’s ongoing growth. Conclusion In conclusion, while coins like SHIB and DOGE have made waves in the past, their short-term potential seems limited as the market shifts.

The token reflected the improving crypto sentiment in April, as well as the potential of altcoins to regain their positions. HYPE rallied to a one-month high of $20.44 after solidifying its positions in April. HYPE is highly responsive to market sentiment, as the perpetual DEX reflects demand for high-risk leveraged trading. According to Arthur Hayes , co-founder of BitMEX and crypto influencer, HYPE is a sign that altcoins can still deliver returns, even though an official ‘altcoin season’ has not been announced. The most asked question of me recently: wen alt szn? Sometimes it’s just staring you in the face. $HYPE pic.twitter.com/SoUcFhOtAQ — Arthur Hayes (@CryptoHayes) May 2, 2025 HYPE has now returned to early February levels and has been on an expansion track since April 7. Since then, HYPE has added more than 100% to its price, setting expectations for revisiting its price record. HYPE started April at $14.40, sinking to lows of around $10.17. On active days, HYPE retained relatively high trading volumes of $150M to $200M. Hyperliquid also serves as a proxy for interest in trading altcoins, in addition to its most active BTC and ETH markets. The DEX remained resilient, offering both long and short opportunities during April’s market correction and recovery. HYPE rises on expectations of new airdrop season One of the main reasons for HYPE’s growth is the expectation of a new airdrop season to be announced in May. For now, there is no official communication from the team. However, based on the Hyperliquid vesting schedule, 38.9% of the tokens are still available for community distribution. Around 37.4% of all HYPE are unlocked, potentially signaling new farming events. They keep updating the UI. Sadly i’m not really a perp person.

It expanded its available liquidity in the past month, based on increased trading demand. In April, the DEX saw a gradual but ongoing inflow of USDC stablecoins. As a result, the available liquidity increased by $200M, from around $1.33B to over $1.53B in early May. Hyperliquid regained some of its stablecoin liquidity with new inflows of USDC in April. | Source: Dune Analytics Hyperliquid surpassed all perpetual DEX protocols, with over $173B in trading volumes for the previous month. The DEX is down from January’s peak of $197B, but has retained most of its activity despite liquidations and aggressive whale traders . Hyperliquid to decentralize the listing process Hyperliquid continues to innovate, aiming to become the go-to hub not just for traders, but for creators and DeFi experts. Currently, Hyperliquid is testing perpetual DEX pairs deployed by third-party developers. The feature is live on testnet. The Hyperliquid protocol will support builder-deployed perps (HIP-3), a key milestone toward fully decentralizing the perp listing process. An MVP of this feature is live on testnet. Feedback is appreciated during this testing phase. Note that numbers and specifications below… — Hyperliquid (@HyperliquidX) May 2, 2025 The task of creating new market pairs will become decentralized in the future. However, to ensure no bad actors and market manipulation, Hyperliquid will require a stake of 1M HYPE. The new DEX perpetual pair launches will allow for additional fees. Hyperliquid is also drawing attention for its HyperEVM, an additional layer secured by the same consensus as the main Hyperliquid L1 chain. The eventual launch of HyperEVM will serve to point even more attention to the project. Cryptopolitan Academy: Want to grow your money in 2025? Learn how to do it with DeFi in our upcoming webclass.

In a post on X dated May 1, the analyst argued that the $2.25 zone—a former breakout pivot—has turned into the battleground on which the next decisive move will be forged. XRP Price Faces Crucial Back-Test “May begins with a critical back-test — XRP’s next move could [come] sooner than many realize!” CasiTrades wrote, framing the current pullback as a textbook retest of broken support turned resistance. According to the technician, failure to sustain bids above $2.25 last week triggered the formation of a three-wave corrective sequence. Sub-wave B appears to have ended with Wednesday’s brief return to $2.25, leaving what CasiTrades calls “a likely C-wave move toward $2.00” as the scenario to monitor. The analyst allows for a deeper intraday liquidity sweep, noting that “if that final leg plays out with momentum, there’s a strong chance we wick down to $1.90,” a price level that has not been visited since XRP’s breakout earlier this quarter. The $1.90 area coincides with both the 0.50 Fibonacci retracement of the entire advance off the correction lows and the 0.618 retracement of the most recent leg—two retracement depths that many technicians treat as high-probability reaction zones. Related Reading: XRP Price Suppressed By ‘Dark Pools,’ Crypto Pundit Claims Short-term momentum gauges are hinting that the corrective phase may be running out of steam. “On the lower time-frames, RSI is flashing exhaustion, which suggests this dip may be short-lived,” the post continues. CasiTrades therefore views the prospective flush as “the final touch of support before XRP flips $2.25 and it’s off to the races,” reiterating upside targets at $2.68, $3.00 and “beyond once we break out cleanly.” For now the bigger picture “remains unchanged,” the analyst concludes. “All signs point to one final flush before structure is ready to launch higher… Excited to see how May begins! Watching closely — not with hype, but pure technicals!” Related Reading: XRP Price Macro Channel Breakout That Puts Targets At $17-$55 Market participants will be watching the $2.00–$1.90 belt for evidence that buyers are indeed defending the midpoint of the recent rally. A convincing reclaim of $2.25, on the other hand, would validate CasiTrades’ thesis that only a “critical back-test” stood between XRP and the next leg toward multi-year highs. At press time, XRP traded at $2.21 and XRP is slowly grinding upwards from the crucial $2.00 support zone (red).

44065947,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=154537,1746187257,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,XRP: Massive 200M XRP Transfer to Ripple Sparks Curiosity,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/xrp-massive-transfer-ripple/,"Crypto enthusiasts and market watchers were recently alerted to a significant on-chain movement involving XRP . According to blockchain tracking service Whale Alert , a staggering 200 million XRP Transfer occurred, originating from an unknown wallet and directed straight to Ripple . This transaction, valued at approximately $444 million at the time of the report, immediately captured the attention of the community. Large movements of digital assets, especially those involving key players like Ripple , are always scrutinized for potential market implications. This particular XRP Transfer is no exception and has sparked considerable discussion across the globe of Crypto News . Unpacking the Whale Alert Report: What Exactly Happened? The notification from Whale Alert was straightforward but impactful. It detailed the transfer of 200,000,000 XRP from an address labeled as ‘unknown wallet’ to an address associated with Ripple . While Whale Alert provides valuable transparency into large transactions, the ‘unknown wallet’ label means the specific source of the funds isn’t immediately clear from publicly available blockchain data alone. This adds a layer of mystery to the event. Key details from the report: Amount: 200,000,000 XRP Origin: Unknown Wallet Destination: Ripple Approximate Value: $444 million Such a substantial amount of XRP moving directly to Ripple ‘s control naturally leads to questions about the purpose and potential outcomes of this transfer. Why Would Ripple Receive Such a Large XRP Transfer ? Exploring the Possibilities Understanding why Ripple might receive 200 million XRP requires looking into Ripple ‘s operations and how they manage their vast holdings of the digital asset. Several scenarios are plausible, and the exact reason often remains undisclosed unless Ripple makes a public statement. Here are some potential explanations for this massive XRP Transfer : 1. Treasury Management and Consolidation: Benefit: Centralizing funds for easier management, accounting, or strategic allocation. Challenge: Lack of transparency can lead to speculation. Explanation: Ripple holds a significant amount of XRP , much of which is locked in escrow. However, they also hold XRP outside of escrow for various purposes. This transfer could simply be an internal movement or the consolidation of funds from wallets previously used for specific operational purposes (like market making or specific partnerships) back into a main treasury wallet controlled by Ripple . 2. Receipt from a Partner or Institution: Benefit: Could signal a new partnership or a settlement involving XRP . Challenge: Requires external confirmation, which may not come. Explanation: It’s possible that a large partner, customer, or even an institutional investor is returning XRP to Ripple . This could be part of a pre-arranged agreement, a settlement, or the unwinding of a specific deal that involved the partner holding a large amount of XRP . The ‘unknown wallet’ could simply be an address not publicly tagged as belonging to a known entity, but is nonetheless controlled by a party interacting with Ripple . 3. Preparation for Sales or Liquidity Provision: Benefit: Could indicate preparations for increasing liquidity for On-Demand Liquidity (ODL) or institutional sales. Challenge: Can trigger fears of sell-offs and potential price drops. Explanation: Ripple historically sells XRP to fund operations and promote the ecosystem, particularly through its ODL product which uses XRP for cross-border payments. Receiving a large sum could mean Ripple is preparing to deploy this XRP into the market, either through over-the-counter (OTC) sales to institutions or by providing liquidity for ODL corridors. While this can be perceived negatively due to potential selling pressure, it’s also a core part of Ripple ‘s business model aimed at increasing XRP utility. 4. Escrow Management (Less Likely in this Direction): Benefit: Part of Ripple ‘s transparent escrow schedule. Challenge: Transfers *to* escrow are more common; transfers *from* escrow are monthly releases. This was *to* Ripple. Explanation: Ripple uses a cryptographic escrow system to lock up the majority of its XRP holdings, releasing 1 billion XRP each month (though they often return a significant portion to escrow). While escrow management is a key part of Ripple ‘s activity, a transfer *to* Ripple from an unknown wallet doesn’t fit the typical escrow release pattern. It would more likely be Ripple returning funds *to* escrow or receiving funds *from* a party related to escrow management, but the ‘unknown wallet’ origin makes this specific scenario less probable compared to others like partner returns or internal consolidation. Table: Potential Reasons for the 200M XRP Transfer to Ripple Potential Reason Likelihood Market Implication Treasury Consolidation High Minimal direct impact, indicates internal activity. Receipt from Partner/Institution Medium Could be positive (partnership) or neutral (settlement). Preparation for Sales/Liquidity Medium Potential for increased supply, perceived negatively by some. Escrow Related (Transfer TO Ripple) Low Unlikely based on typical escrow flow. The Significance of a Large XRP Transfer in the Market Any time a large amount of a cryptocurrency is moved, especially by a major entity like Ripple , it’s significant for several reasons. Firstly, it highlights the underlying activity and use of the blockchain. Secondly, it can influence market sentiment. A large transfer *to* Ripple could be interpreted differently than a large transfer *from* Ripple to an exchange. A transfer *to* Ripple from an unknown wallet might be seen positively if it’s interpreted as a partner returning funds or a sign of ecosystem activity. Conversely, if it’s perceived as Ripple consolidating funds for future sales, it could lead to concerns about increased supply and potential price pressure. The market’s reaction often depends heavily on speculation and the broader context of Crypto News and the current market cycle. The Role of Whale Alert in Tracking Crypto Movements Services like Whale Alert play a crucial role in providing transparency in the often opaque world of cryptocurrency. By monitoring public blockchain addresses known to belong to exchanges, major projects, or large holders (whales), they can flag significant transactions in near real-time. This allows the community to stay informed about where large sums of digital assets are moving, which can be a leading indicator of potential market shifts. While Whale Alert can report the movement and often the entities involved (if the addresses are known), they typically cannot reveal the specific *reason* for the transfer. This is why a report like the 200M XRP Transfer sparks so much discussion and speculation. Implications for the XRP Market and Price The immediate impact of a large XRP Transfer like this on the price is often minimal unless it’s followed by subsequent transfers to exchanges, which would signal an intent to sell. However, the news itself can affect sentiment. Traders and investors monitor these movements closely as potential signals. If the market interprets the transfer as Ripple preparing for sales, it might lead to bearish sentiment. If it’s seen as consolidation or a return from a partner, the sentiment might be neutral or even slightly positive, suggesting underlying activity within the Ripple ecosystem. The actual price movement will depend on the market’s overall reaction, trading volume, and other concurrent Crypto News . Historically, Ripple ‘s monthly escrow releases and subsequent sales have been a point of contention for some in the XRP community, who view them as a source of selling pressure. While Ripple maintains that its sales are strategic and aimed at fostering utility, large transfers to their wallets will always be viewed through this lens. Broader Context: What This Means for Crypto News This XRP Transfer highlights the importance of on-chain data analysis in the world of Crypto News . While traditional news sources report on company announcements and market trends, tracking large wallet movements provides a ground-level view of activity on the blockchain itself. It serves as a reminder that significant events are constantly unfolding on distributed ledgers, and monitoring them can offer valuable insights, even if the full story isn’t immediately apparent. This type of report also underscores the need for caution when interpreting data. A large transfer is a fact, but the *why* behind it is often open to interpretation and speculation. Relying solely on a single data point from Whale Alert without considering the broader context and potential reasons can lead to misinformed conclusions. Challenges and Actionable Insights Challenge: The primary challenge for investors is the ambiguity surrounding the transfer. Without an official statement from Ripple , the exact purpose of the 200M XRP Transfer remains speculative. This uncertainty can lead to volatility based on rumors or incorrect assumptions. Actionable Insights: Monitor Ripple’s Official Channels: Keep an eye on Ripple ‘s official announcements for any statements that might clarify the nature of this transaction. Watch Subsequent Movements: Observe if the transferred XRP is subsequently moved from the receiving Ripple wallet to exchanges or other known addresses. This could provide clues about potential liquidation or deployment. Consider Market Sentiment: Gauge how the broader market is reacting to the news. Is it causing panic, or is it being largely ignored? Understand the Possibilities: Be aware of the various potential reasons for the transfer (consolidation, partner return, preparation for sales) and don’t jump to conclusions. Summary: A Large Transfer Keeps the Market Guessing The 200 million XRP Transfer reported by Whale Alert from an unknown wallet to Ripple is undoubtedly a significant event in the world of XRP and Crypto News . Valued at nearly half a billion dollars, such a movement demands attention. While the exact reason remains unconfirmed, plausible explanations range from internal treasury management and consolidation to the return of funds from a partner or even preparation for future strategic sales or liquidity provision. The ‘unknown wallet’ adds an element of intrigue, preventing immediate identification of the source. This event underscores the vital role of on-chain monitoring services like Whale Alert in providing transparency, while also highlighting the challenges of interpreting raw blockchain data without context. For XRP holders and market participants, the key takeaway is to remain vigilant, monitor Ripple ‘s future activities involving these funds, and avoid making impulsive decisions based solely on the transfer notification. As the situation develops, the market will be watching closely for any further movements or official commentary from Ripple that could shed more light on this massive XRP Transfer .

44066242,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=154541,1746187859,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,"XRP Escrow: Ripple Locks 170 Million, Unpacking the Strategic Impact",https://bitcoinworld.co.in/xrp-ripple-escrow-impact/,"The world of cryptocurrency is always buzzing with activity, and recent reports from Whale Alert have once again turned the spotlight onto XRP and its issuer, Ripple . The news? A significant amount of XRP , specifically 170 million tokens, has been locked away in XRP escrow . While this might sound like a sudden event, it’s actually part of a long-standing, strategic mechanism employed by Ripple. But what exactly does this mean for the digital asset and its ecosystem? Understanding Ripple’s Strategic XRP Escrow System To grasp the significance of 170 million XRP being locked, we first need to understand Ripple ‘s escrow system. Back in 2017, Ripple announced it would place 55 billion XRP (which was roughly 55% of the total supply at the time) into a series of cryptographically-secured escrows. The purpose was clear: to create certainty around the supply of XRP available on the market at any given time. The system works by releasing 1 billion XRP from escrow on the first day of each month. Ripple then has the flexibility to use these tokens for various purposes, such as incentivizing market makers, funding partnerships, or selling to institutions for On-Demand Liquidity (ODL) purposes. Any amount of that 1 billion XRP that is not used by the end of the month is then returned and placed back into a new escrow, set to expire in 55 months. This is precisely what the report of 170 million XRP being locked likely refers to – a portion of a previous monthly release that wasn’t utilized and has now been re-escrowed. Think of it like a timed release vault. Every month, a compartment opens (1 billion XRP released). Ripple takes what it needs for its operations and growth initiatives. Anything left over goes back into a different compartment with a new, longer timer. This process continues, providing a predictable flow of XRP into the market rather than a large, unpredictable supply hanging over it. Why is XRP Escrow Important for the Digital Asset? The escrow mechanism is a cornerstone of Ripple ‘s strategy for managing the supply of XRP . Its importance can be broken down into several key areas: Predictability: Before the escrow, there was uncertainty about how Ripple might distribute or sell its large holdings. The escrow provides a clear, scheduled release mechanism. This predictability is crucial for market participants, allowing them to better assess supply dynamics. Supply Management: By locking up the majority of the supply, Ripple prevents sudden, massive dumps onto the open market that could negatively impact the price. It ensures that only a controlled amount is potentially available each month. Transparency: While Ripple controls the escrow, the scheduled releases and the re-locking of unused tokens are transparently recorded on the XRP Ledger. Services like Whale Alert monitor and report these movements, keeping the community informed. Building Trust: By voluntarily locking up such a significant portion of XRP , Ripple signaled its long-term commitment and aimed to build trust within the community and with potential institutional partners, demonstrating that they are not looking for a quick exit. The locking of 170 million XRP , therefore, isn’t just a random event; it’s a routine part of this carefully designed system that influences the supply side of the digital asset ‘s economics. How Does This Lock Impact the Cryptocurrency Market? While the locking of 170 million XRP is a standard procedure, it still has implications for the broader cryptocurrency market and specifically for XRP ‘s market dynamics. When a portion of the monthly release is returned to escrow, it means that amount is removed from the potential circulating supply for an extended period (55 months). This can be seen as a positive signal as it indicates that Ripple did not need to sell or distribute the full 1 billion XRP released that month. Fewer tokens potentially entering the market from Ripple’s reserves can, theoretically, reduce potential sell pressure. However, it’s also important to maintain perspective. 170 million XRP is a large number in isolation, but it’s a fraction of the total supply (currently over 100 billion XRP ) and the amount held in escrow (tens of billions). The market’s reaction to such reports is often nuanced, factoring in many other variables like overall market sentiment, regulatory news (particularly the SEC lawsuit against Ripple), adoption rates of Ripple’s products, and macroeconomic factors. Nevertheless, the consistent reporting by services like Whale Alert serves as a regular reminder of the structured supply schedule of XRP , which is a unique characteristic among major cryptocurrencies. The Role of Whale Alert in Tracking Digital Asset Movements Whale Alert is a popular service that tracks large transactions on various blockchain networks, including the XRP Ledger. Their automated alerts highlight significant movements, often involving large holders or exchanges – hence the term “whale” transactions. For the XRP ecosystem, Whale Alert plays a vital role in providing transparency regarding Ripple’s escrow movements. While the schedule of 1 billion XRP releases is known, Whale Alert confirms when these releases occur and, importantly, when unused portions are returned to escrow. Their reports, like the one about the 170 million XRP lock, quickly disseminate this information to the community via social media and other channels. This external validation of Ripple’s stated escrow process helps build confidence and ensures that the community can independently verify the flow of tokens from Ripple’s reserves. It’s a key piece of the transparency puzzle for the digital asset . Ripple’s Vision and How Escrow Fits In Ripple ‘s primary focus is on building payment solutions using blockchain technology, with XRP intended to be a bridge currency for fast, low-cost cross-border transactions via its On-Demand Liquidity (ODL) service. The XRP escrow system is intrinsically linked to this vision. Ripple needs access to XRP to fund its operations, invest in the ecosystem, and provide liquidity for ODL corridors. The monthly escrow releases provide the necessary supply for these activities in a controlled manner. The fact that 170 million XRP was returned suggests that the amount needed for the past month’s activities was less than the full 1 billion released, which could be interpreted in various ways – perhaps slower than expected ODL growth in certain areas, or simply efficient use of funds. The ongoing legal battle with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has undoubtedly impacted Ripple’s ability to utilize XRP within the United States, potentially affecting the amount of XRP needed from the monthly releases. However, Ripple has continued to expand its ODL service internationally, suggesting that a significant portion of the released XRP is still being deployed globally. Benefits and Challenges of the XRP Escrow Like any system, the XRP escrow has its upsides and downsides: Benefits: Increased Market Certainty: Reduces the fear of unpredictable supply dumps. Structured Supply: Provides a clear schedule for potential new XRP entering circulation. Support for Ripple’s Business: Ensures Ripple has access to funds for development, partnerships, and ODL. Transparency (via Ledger & Trackers): Movements are public and monitored. Challenges: Centralization Concerns: A vast majority of XRP is controlled by Ripple and locked in their escrows, leading to concerns about the concentration of power. Potential for Large Unlocks: While scheduled, the monthly release of 1 billion XRP is still a substantial amount that could theoretically be sold, although historical data shows significant portions are typically re-escrowed. Influence on Market Perception: Escrow movements are constantly analyzed and debated by the community, sometimes leading to speculation. The locking of 170 million XRP highlights both aspects – it demonstrates the system is working as intended (re-locking unused tokens) but also reminds the market of the significant supply held and managed by Ripple. Actionable Insights for XRP Enthusiasts and Investors For those interested in XRP , understanding the escrow system and the significance of reports like the 170 million XRP lock is key. Here are some actionable insights: Monitor Escrow Reports: Keep an eye on Whale Alert and other trackers for the monthly 1 billion XRP releases and subsequent re-locks. This provides real-time data on how much of the released supply is being utilized by Ripple. Understand Supply vs. Demand: The escrow primarily affects the supply side. While important, remember that price is also heavily influenced by demand drivers like adoption of Ripple’s ODL, regulatory clarity, and overall cryptocurrency market sentiment. Focus on Fundamentals: Don’t get overly fixated on individual escrow movements. Instead, focus on Ripple’s business growth, partnerships, ODL transaction volumes, and developments in the SEC case, as these are stronger indicators of long-term value for the digital asset . Maintain a Long-Term Perspective: The escrow system is designed to play out over several years. Consider the long-term implications of a structured supply release rather than reacting impulsively to monthly reports. The 170 million XRP lock is a piece of a much larger, ongoing process that is fundamental to the structure of the XRP ecosystem. Understanding this process is vital for any serious observer of the digital asset . Conclusion: The Ongoing Significance of XRP Escrow The report by Whale Alert that 170 million XRP has been locked in escrow at Ripple is not just a headline; it’s a confirmation that Ripple’s long-term supply management strategy for the digital asset is actively in motion. The XRP escrow system, established in 2017, continues to function as designed, providing a predictable schedule for the release of billions of XRP over time. The re-locking of unused tokens, like the 170 million reported, is a standard part of this process, indicating that the full monthly release was not required for Ripple’s operations or distribution that cycle. While the escrow system has its critics regarding centralization, it undeniably offers a level of transparency and supply predictability that is relatively unique in the cryptocurrency space. For investors and enthusiasts, monitoring these movements provides valuable insight into the supply side of XRP economics, though it should always be considered alongside demand drivers, regulatory developments, and Ripple’s overall business growth when assessing the future potential of this significant digital asset .

The candidate, who had applied for an engineering position, raised suspicions early on by using a different name during the interview and inconsistently switching between voices—suggesting real-time coaching. Instead of cutting the interview short, Kraken chose a more strategic route. The team allowed the applicant to proceed through several stages of the hiring pipeline, turning the process into an opportunity to uncover deeper intelligence on the methods and networks used by the infiltrator. Hiring Process Unmasks an International Threat According to a blog post published by Kraken on May 1, the incident aligns with warnings from industry partners who had already flagged suspicious hiring attempts tied to North Korea . A key breakthrough came when Kraken matched the applicant’s email with a list previously identified as being associated with North Korean hacking collectives. The investigation revealed a complex network of fake identities being used to target multiple crypto firms, not just Kraken. Technical inconsistencies piled up—VPN-masked remote Mac desktops, suspicious ID documents, and a resume linked to a GitHub profile using an email compromised in an old data breach. It became increasingly evident that the applicant’s primary identification had been doctored, likely built on details from a two-year-old identity theft case. Final interviews were conducted by Kraken’s chief security officer, Nick Percoco, who used trap verification protocols. The candidate failed, confirming the worst: a state-backed attempt at infiltration. “This isn’t just a crypto security concern — it’s a global one,” said Percoco. “The old adage in crypto, ‘Don’t trust, verify,’ has never rung truer.” North Korean Lazarus Group North Korea has ramped up its focus on the crypto industry, often as a means of circumventing international sanctions. The Lazarus Group, a state-sponsored hacking syndicate, has been tied to numerous heists—including the record-breaking $1.4 billion hack of Bybit in February . According to joint statements by the U.S., South Korea, and Japan, North Korean hackers stole over $650 million in 2024 alone. Some even established U.S.-based shell companies to push malware and infiltrate developer networks. Kraken’s exposé serves as a stark reminder: In crypto, threats aren’t always external — sometimes, they come through your front door disguised as opportunity.

The company, which has already made waves with its previous Bitcoin acquisitions, is leveraging financial instruments to fuel its Bitcoin investment strategy. Why is Metaplanet Doubling Down on Metaplanet Bitcoin? Metaplanet shared on the social media platform X that it is issuing 3.6 billion yen, equivalent to approximately $24.7 million, in zero-percent ordinary bonds. The stated purpose of this bond issuance is explicitly to purchase additional Bitcoin (BTC). This decision underscores Metaplanet’s strategic shift towards adopting Bitcoin as a core treasury asset. Public companies investing corporate funds into volatile assets like Bitcoin is a trend pioneered by firms like MicroStrategy in the West, and Metaplanet appears to be championing this approach in Japan. Key details about the bond issuance: Amount: 3.6 billion JPY ($24.7 million) Type: Zero-percent ordinary bonds Purpose: To acquire more Bitcoin By issuing zero-percent bonds, Metaplanet is essentially taking on debt at no interest cost, making the capital acquisition highly favorable, assuming they can deploy it effectively into an asset they believe will appreciate, like Bitcoin. What Does This Mean for Japan Bitcoin Adoption? Metaplanet’s actions are particularly noteworthy given its location. As a publicly traded company in Japan, its aggressive Japan Bitcoin strategy could influence other Japanese corporations. Japan has a unique regulatory landscape for cryptocurrencies, and a mainstream company embracing Bitcoin as a treasury reserve asset sends a strong signal to the local market and potentially the broader Asian financial sector. While regulatory clarity and corporate risk aversion have sometimes been cited as hurdles for widespread crypto adoption among traditional Japanese businesses, Metaplanet is demonstrating a different path. Their increasing exposure to Bitcoin positions them as a potential leader in the Corporate Bitcoin adoption space within the country. Metaplanet’s Growing Bitcoin Investment Portfolio Prior to this planned purchase, Metaplanet already held a substantial amount of Bitcoin. The company reported holding a total of 5,000 BTC. At current market prices (which fluctuate), this existing holding alone represents a significant investment. Adding another $24.7 million worth of Bitcoin will significantly boost their total holdings. This continuous accumulation strategy suggests a long-term conviction in Bitcoin’s value proposition as a store of value and a hedge against potential economic instability or currency devaluation. This approach is similar to the strategies employed by other firms globally who view Bitcoin as ‘digital gold’ or a superior reserve asset compared to traditional fiat currencies or low-yield bonds. Is This a Trend? Exploring Corporate Bitcoin Strategies Metaplanet’s move is part of a growing, albeit still relatively small, trend of public companies adding Bitcoin to their balance sheets. This Bitcoin investment strategy is often driven by a desire to preserve capital against inflation, seek uncorrelated asset returns, or simply gain exposure to a burgeoning digital asset class. While companies like MicroStrategy are the most prominent examples with billions of dollars in Bitcoin holdings, Metaplanet’s consistent acquisitions highlight that this strategy is not limited to just one or two firms and is gaining traction in different geographical markets. The issuance of Metaplanet bonds specifically for Bitcoin purchase is a notable financing method. It indicates the company’s willingness to use its balance sheet and leverage to acquire the asset, signaling high conviction. Benefits highlighted by companies pursuing this strategy often include: Potential hedge against inflation Long-term store of value potential Diversification of treasury assets Attracting investor interest in the digital asset space Challenges and risks include: Bitcoin’s price volatility Regulatory uncertainty Custody and security risks Accounting and tax complexities Despite the risks, Metaplanet’s continued investment demonstrates a calculated decision to navigate these challenges for the perceived long-term benefits of holding Bitcoin. What Are the Actionable Insights? For investors and market watchers, Metaplanet’s bond issuance and planned Bitcoin purchase offer several insights: Growing Institutional Interest: It reinforces the narrative that institutional and corporate interest in Bitcoin remains strong, extending beyond just investment funds. Japan’s Role: It positions Japan as a market where corporate crypto adoption is actively happening, potentially paving the way for others. Financing Methods: It showcases how companies are creatively financing Bitcoin acquisitions, even through debt instruments like zero-percent bonds. Long-Term Strategy: It indicates that for some companies, Bitcoin is not a short-term trade but a long-term treasury reserve strategy. This development suggests that the trend of corporate balance sheets holding Bitcoin may continue, potentially influencing market dynamics and further integrating Bitcoin into traditional finance. In Conclusion: Metaplanet’s Bold Bitcoin Bet Metaplanet’s decision to issue $24.7 million in zero-percent bonds specifically to buy more Bitcoin is a clear affirmation of its commitment to its Bitcoin-centric treasury strategy. With existing holdings of 5,000 BTC, this additional purchase will significantly increase its exposure. This move is not only important for Metaplanet but also serves as a notable example of corporate Bitcoin adoption within Japan, potentially inspiring other firms in the region and globally to consider similar strategies. It underscores the growing conviction among some public companies that Bitcoin deserves a place on their balance sheets as a long-term store of value and a hedge.

This market movement could signal a turning point for other digital currencies. Ethereum , Dogecoin , and XRP are showing signs of potential growth. The evolving market dynamics hint at exciting opportunities. Explore what this means for these cryptocurrencies and what could come next. Ethereum Price Dynamics: Assessing Levels After Recent Dips Over the last month, Ethereum experienced a modest decline of about 3.6%, and over the past six months it saw a sharper drop nearing 26%. The weekly gain of 3.8% hints at some recovery action, though the overall trend remains weak. The price trajectory reflects a period of selling pressure with sporadic short-term rallies that failed to reverse the longer-term downtrend. The current price action finds Ethereum trading between $1,468 and $2,037. Buyers face resistance around $2,280 and $2,850, while support appears solid near $1,142. Bulls are trying to step in within this range, though the lack of a clear trend calls for cautious trades near key support and resistance levels. Dogecoin: Month Gains and Six-Month Rally Point to a Critical Price Range Dogecoin showed a steady rise over the past month with a gain of 3.68%, while a slight weekly drop of 1.15% added some short-term hesitance. Over the last six months, the coin advanced by about 12.48%, reflecting gradual recovery and positive sentiment among traders. The past performance indicates a mix of small corrections and sustained upward progress. DOGE currently trades between $0.1371 and $0.2002, with resistance spotted near $0.2281 and a primary support at $0.1019. Price action remains confined within these levels, with technical signals hinting at a modest bullish tilt. Traders may look to purchase near the support area, watching for a breakout toward resistance for further upside potential. XRP’s Explosive Growth and Current Price Dynamics Over the past month, XRP increased by about 3.64%, while the six-month growth soared to an impressive 334.31%. Price movement has remained within the range of $1.75 to $2.50, indicating a strong upward trend. This long-term gain reflects renewed market interest and support for XRP, highlighting its potential in the current financial landscape. Current levels show immediate resistance at $2.80 and support at $1.31, with further resistance at $3.55 and support near $0.56. Bulls are currently in control, but the overall trend is cautious as prices test these key levels. Trading ideas suggest buying on dips close to $1.31 while monitoring for breakthroughs past $2.80 to confirm ongoing bullish momentum. Conclusion ETH , DOGE , and XRP are showing signs of a potential shift. Bitcoin's rise towards $100K is creating buzz. This could lead to increased interest in these three coins. It's a critical time for ETH, DOGE, and XRP as they might follow Bitcoin's upward trend. Investors are closely watching these developments. The market dynamics are changing, and these coins may be set for new opportunities. Disclaimer: This is a sponsored article and is for informational purposes only.

RSI is closing in on the historical rejection zone (79–81) that triggered two past sell-offs A rising MACD supports continued upside, but history says momentum could stall near $0.074–$0.082 resistance. If momentum weakens, $0.054–$0.057 offers a likely support zone. But if BRETT pushes through $0.074–$0.082, it could set off the next major leg up. The recent hype surrounding the Brett Carnival in Dubai for Token 2049 (May 1, 2025) has brought fresh attention and volume to the BRETT coin . The event, promoted by the official Brett account and partners like m3taweb3, served as a bullish catalyst that pushed prices upward in late April. Following the announcement on April 18, BRETT’s price jumped from $0.029 to $0.057 by April 23, a 96.5% rally in just five days that reignited bullish momentum. BRETT is trading at $0.06502 , up 2.46% in the past 24 hours , with a market cap of $644.43 million and a 24-hour trading volume of $49.28 million . To rejoin the $1 billion market cap club, a milestone it lost on January 19, 2025, BRETT would need to climb to approximately $0.10, reflecting a 55% upside from current levels.. BRETT/USD Sits Critical At RSI And Key Resistance Levels Looking at the BRETTUSD chart and on-chain metrics, the asset is showing signs of a maturing rally backed by strong short-term momentum. Over the past month, BRETT has gained 108%, supported by a consistent increase in volume (+17.95%) and renewed social buzz following its Token 2049 presence and Brett Carnival event in Dubai. Technically, RSI is currently at 69, just below the historical rejection zone (79–81) — which previously marked two sharp sell-offs, including one from its all-time high at $0.26 in DEC1 2024. In those cases, RSI crossing 79 led to immediate reversals within a few sessions. If RSI reaches that same zone again, traders should expect a test of the $0.074–$0.082 resistance, with a potential extension to $0.09–$0.10 if momentum strengthens. A push toward $0.10–$0.11, the estimated price needed for BRETT to reclaim a $1 billion market cap, would mark a psychological and technical milestone. Meanwhile, the MACD remains in bullish territory, with the signal line crossover intact, confirming upward bias. However, histogram bars are beginning to flatten, signalling slowing acceleration — a potential early warning for trend exhaustion. If buyers fail to push through the $0.074–$0.082 band, price may pull back toward support at $0.057, with deeper cushions near $0.045, where the previous breakout began. Whale Silence, Retail Surge: Chart Signals Maturing BRETT Rally Backed by Organic Momentum Only 12.19% of holders are in profit, while 79.22% remain at a loss, concentrated between $0.077–$0.13. If price revisits those zones in the coming 7–10 days, this could trigger aggressive profit-taking or fuel the rally if holders wait for higher prices. The IntoTheBlock chart reveals a sharp spike in large transactions—hitting nearly 180 txs on March 6 —indicating significant whale activity, possibly accumulation or distribution. Post-spike, large transactions dropped sharply, averaging 2–11 txs daily , even as BRETT’s price recovered from a low near $0.024 in early April to around $0.032 by April 30 . This divergence signals a shift from whale-driven moves to retail-led momentum. Notably, the 7-day high of 30 txs on April 26 aligns with renewed buying interest following the Dubai event. For traders, this suggests a maturing rally backed by organic demand, with whale inactivity hinting at untapped upside if momentum continues. Strategy Insight for Traders Expect upside momentum to persist for another 2–5 days, targeting the $0.074–$0.10 zone. If RSI reaches 80, be cautious: tighten stops or scale out partially. Failure to break $0.074 may result in a quick fade to $0.057, with full cooldown support at $0.045.

That’s what Finance Minister Katsunobu Kato waved in America’s face on Friday, right on national television. Asked if Japan would ever use its role as the world’s biggest foreign holder of US government debt as a weapon in trade talks with President Donald Trump’s administration, Kato didn’t blink. He said, “It does exist as a card,” and tossed that line like a lit match. “Whether or not we use that card is a different decision.” This wasn’t some offhand comment either. Japan has always avoided even talking about dumping Treasuries. But now, with Trump throwing around “ reciprocal ” tariffs like candy since April 2, Tokyo’s keeping its options open. That tariff stunt already sent US markets into a tailspin. Treasury yields spiked, bonds got dumped, and traders panicked. After the chaos, Trump paused the tariffs for 90 days, but of course, the damage was already done. Japan uses bond threat to push back on Trump’s tariff war Kato’s words landed hours after Ryosei Akazawa, Japan’s top trade negotiator, wrapped up another tense meeting in Washington. He sat down with Scott Bessent, Trump’s Treasury Secretary, and other White House officials. No details were made public, but diplomatic sources say they talked about US car imports, energy, and agriculture deals. The trade surplus with the US is a long-time sore spot, and Trump wants it cut—fast. The Japanese side might consider buying more American gas and farm goods. But that’s not happening without a fight. Kato, who met Bessent personally in the last week of April, is one of the key guys in this whole thing. And he’s clearly had enough. Analysts are calling it what it is: a warning shot. Nicholas Smith, chief Japan strategist at CLSA, said , “This is a street fight. Promising not to use one of your strongest, most brutal weapons would be both naive and reckless. You don’t need to use the weapon—just brandish it.” And that’s exactly what Kato did. It’s not just about Japan either. If China, which also holds a mountain of Treasuries, jumps in with a similar threat, the US bond market is screwed. Between Japan’s stash and China’s, the leverage is real. With Japan leading the charge now, they’ve opened the door to something much bigger. The prime minister of Japan has already called Trump’s trade war a “national crisis.” Kato taking this public shows just how fed up he and his top guys are. Jesper Koll, director at Monex Group, called the move shocking, especially from someone as careful as Kato. “The fact that the usually extremely guarded and diplomatic finance minister spoke up on national TV about what is arguably Japan’s biggest asset in dealing with America confirms the growing confidence of Japan’s elite in their dealings with the US,” Koll said. Negotiations between Akazawa and the Trump team are expected to ramp up through May, with a possible deal on the table by June. But Japan’s now fighting back with sharp elbows. They’re not just asking for “fairness.” They’re saying: Touch us again, and we torch the bond market. Cryptopolitan Academy: Coming Soon - A New Way to Earn Passive Income with DeFi in 2025.

The price could hit a high of $3.99 in 2025. XRP Price Today: XRP value has fallen 1.10% in 24 hours to $2.21. XRP has been making positive shifts in the crypto market. In a very recent XRP news, Japan’s banking sector is preparing for a major transformation, with nearly 80% of banks planning to adopt XRP in 2025. It has also surpassed Ethereum in trading activity. On the other hand, XRP ETFs are what every investor is curious about. In the latest update on the Ripple vs SEC case, Attorney Fred Rispoli has provided an updated timeline for the SEC v. Ripple case. He stated that the necessary documentation had already been produced following Alderoty’s declaration, and they are now awaiting a vote by the SEC Commission, which is expected in 30 days. Talking about the XRP price, it is down by 1.10% to $2.21. If the bullish momentum continues, XRP could aim at its resistance level of $2.54. On the flip side, if it loses out on steam, the XRP price could take a plunge to $2.098. Our Ripple XRP price prediction will explore the potential answers to questions such as “Will XRP reach $10 in 2025?” and “Will XRP go up?” What is the XRP price prediction for today? According to the XRP price analysis done by our expert panel, the XRP crypto price today could go as high as $2.54. XRP Price Today Cryptocurrency XRP Token XRP Price $ 2.22409709 -0.26% Market cap $ 130,117,564,623.66 Circulating Supply 58,503,545,101.00 Trading Volume $ 2,129,206,176.5501 All-time high $3.84 Jan 04, 2018 All-time low $0.002802 Jul 07, 2014 XRP Crypto Price Prediction May 2025 XRP is trading around $2.21, maintaining a steady range after a previous sharp rally. The 9-day SMA is slightly above the current price, indicating mild bearish pressure. RSI near 53 suggests neutral momentum. Visible patterns include a potential ascending triangle forming since April, signaling bullish consolidation. If XRP breaks above $2.25 with volume, upside continuation is likely. Support is near $2.00. Overall, XRP shows consolidation with a bullish bias for May 2025 if resistance levels are breached. XRP Price Prediction May 2025 High Price : $2.50 Low Price : $1.85 Average Price : $2.0 XRP Price Prediction 2025 The SEC believes that XRP can help release funds stuck in the U.S. Nostro accounts, which can then be used to buy more Bitcoins. There is more positive news for Ripple, as they have integrated their stablecoin RLUSD into their cross-border payments network: Ripple Payments . Moreover, JP Morgan Chase has approved XRP for use within its banking payment framework. If things go in favor of Ripple, the XRP price could surge to a maximum of $5.81 by the end of 2025. In contrast, if the lawsuit continues, the value of XRP could remain in a narrow range with a potential low of $2.3. That being said, we can expect an average Ripple price of $4.89. Year Potential Low Potential Average Potential High 2025 $2.3 $4.89 $5.81 Ripple XRP Price Prediction 2026 – 2030 Year Potential Low ($) Potential Average ($) Potential High ($) 2026 5.6 6.25 8.64 2027 7.15 8.89 12.25 2028 11.3 14.11 16.53 2029 13.98 16.48 21.12 2030 16.92 19.87 26.97 XRP Price Prediction 2026 XRP cost will likely witness strong growth in 2026. There is a possibility that XRP can break through the $8.64 level and hold the price by the end of 2026. The minimum price of XRP will be around $5.6, with an average trading price of $6.25. This could be a result of Ripple’s role in CBDC development and XRP’s rising institutional demand. Ripple Price Prediction 2027 By 2027, market analysts and experts predict that XRP coin price will range between $7.15 to $12.25. XRP price might record an average level of $8.89. The reason behind this surge could be due to Ripple’s increasing domination in the payment sector, accelerating XRP’s buying demand and utility. XRP Price Prediction 2028 In 2028, Ripple could increase its use cases, including new dApps and announcements regarding XRP. This might boost the dominance of XRP as the second-largest altcoin by market cap. We expect the XRP future price to range between $11.3 to $16.53. The average trading price of Ripple could be around $14.11. XRP Price Prediction 2029 Partnerships with multiple governments and wider adoption might strengthen XRP’s price in 2029. The price of XRP might record a trading range between $13.98 to $21.12, with an average price of $16.48. XRP Price Prediction 2030 The XRP prediction 2030 depends on Ripple’s ability to expand its offerings across the crypto market. If everything remains positive, the Ripple coin price could scale between $16.92 to $26.97. With that price range, the average tag could be $19.87.

44068495,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=154629,1746192603,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Worldcoin USDC Integration Unleashing Secure Cross-Chain Transfers,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/worldcoin-usdc-integration/,"Get ready for a significant development in the decentralized world! World (formerly Worldcoin), the project focused on creating a decentralized identity and financial network, has just announced a major step forward. In a move poised to enhance its ecosystem, World is integrating Circle’s USD-backed stablecoin, USDC, and the updated Cross-Chain Transfer Protocol (CCTP) V2. This Worldcoin USDC Integration is more than just adding a stablecoin; it’s about building a more robust, interconnected, and user-friendly financial network tied to their unique approach to Digital Identity . Understanding the Pillars: Worldcoin, USDC, and CCTP V2 Before diving into the specifics of the integration, let’s quickly touch upon the key players and technologies involved: Worldcoin (World): At its core, Worldcoin aims to provide a reliable way to distinguish humans from AI online through World ID, verified initially via physical devices called Orbs. Beyond identity, it envisions a global financial network accessible to everyone, often distributing WLD tokens to verified users. USDC: Issued by Circle, USDC is one of the most widely used stablecoins in the crypto space. Its value is pegged 1:1 with the US dollar, making it a crucial tool for transactions, saving, and transfers in the volatile crypto market without the wild price swings of assets like Bitcoin or Ethereum. Its stability is key for fostering broader Stablecoin Adoption . CCTP V2: The Cross-Chain Transfer Protocol (CCTP) is a permissionless protocol developed by Circle that facilitates the secure transfer of USDC natively across different blockchains. V2 represents an evolution, aiming for even greater efficiency and broader support, making seamless Cross-Chain Transfers a reality. Why is This Worldcoin USDC Integration Happening Now? Worldcoin’s goal is to build a financial and identity layer for the internet. To achieve this, providing users with access to stable, reliable digital money is essential. USDC fits this need perfectly due to its stability, widespread adoption, and regulatory compliance efforts by Circle. Integrating USDC directly into the Worldcoin ecosystem means users potentially have a straightforward way to hold and transact value pegged to the US dollar. Furthermore, enabling seamless movement of this value across different blockchain networks is critical for a truly global and accessible network. This is where CCTP V2 comes into play. By leveraging CCTP V2, Worldcoin can allow users to move USDC in and out of their ecosystem, across supported chains, with greater ease and potentially lower costs compared to traditional bridging methods. What Does This Mean for Worldcoin Users and the Ecosystem? The integration of USDC and CCTP V2 brings several tangible benefits and opens up new possibilities for the Worldcoin network and individuals holding a World ID: Enhanced Utility and Access The most immediate impact is providing Worldcoin users with direct access to a major stablecoin. This facilitates: Easier Transactions: Users can potentially hold and transfer value in a stable currency within Worldcoin-linked applications. Reduced Volatility Risk: Holding value in USDC protects users from the price fluctuations common in cryptocurrencies like WLD or Ether. On-ramps and Off-ramps: As ecosystem support grows, this could simplify getting value into and out of the Worldcoin network using a widely accepted stable asset. Seamless Cross-Chain Transfers Leveraging CCTP V2 is a game-changer for interoperability. Instead of relying on potentially complex or less secure third-party bridges, users could benefit from native USDC transfers across supported chains. How does CCTP V2 work? In simple terms: USDC is burned on the source blockchain. A message is sent to the destination blockchain via a secure oracle network. An equivalent amount of *new* USDC is minted on the destination blockchain. The user receives the newly minted USDC on the target chain. This process is designed to be more secure and efficient for transferring native USDC, bolstering the potential for widespread Cross-Chain Transfers within the Worldcoin orbit. Boosting Stablecoin Adoption within the Network By making USDC a first-class citizen within the Worldcoin ecosystem, the project actively promotes Stablecoin Adoption among its user base. This is crucial for a network aiming to be a financial utility, as stablecoins are often the preferred medium for payments, remittances, and savings in the digital economy. Strengthening the Digital Identity and Financial Network Vision Worldcoin’s core mission links Digital Identity with financial access. By integrating a globally recognized stablecoin and robust cross-chain technology, they are building out the ‘financial network’ part of their vision. A verified identity (World ID) combined with easy access to stable value (USDC) and seamless movement (CCTP V2) creates a more compelling platform for users worldwide. Are There Any Challenges or Considerations? While the integration is a positive step, like any major development, there are factors to consider: Adoption Curve: Will users readily adopt USDC within the Worldcoin ecosystem? The utility needs to be clear and compelling. Regulatory Landscape: Both stablecoins and identity-focused crypto projects face ongoing regulatory scrutiny globally. Developments in this area could impact the integration. Technical Implementation: Ensuring the secure and smooth functioning of the integration, especially with CCTP V2, requires careful technical execution. Ecosystem Development: The true value unlocks as more applications and services within the Worldcoin ecosystem utilize USDC and CCTP V2. Looking Ahead: What’s Next for Worldcoin, USDC, and CCTP V2? This Worldcoin USDC Integration could pave the way for numerous future developments. We might see: Increased use cases for World ID holders involving USDC payments or transfers. Further integrations with DeFi protocols or traditional financial services that utilize USDC. Expansion of CCTP V2 support to more chains relevant to the Worldcoin community. Greater focus on leveraging Digital Identity for compliant and secure USDC transactions. The move signals Worldcoin’s commitment to building a functional financial layer, not just an identity layer, leveraging established and efficient technologies like USDC and CCTP V2 to facilitate global access and utility. Conclusion: A Step Towards a More Integrated Digital Future Worldcoin’s decision to integrate Circle’s USDC and the advanced CCTP V2 protocol is a significant milestone. It directly addresses the need for stable value and seamless interoperability within its growing network. By embracing this Worldcoin USDC Integration , the project enhances the utility for its users, promotes wider Stablecoin Adoption , and strengthens its position as a platform aiming to connect Digital Identity with accessible finance through efficient Cross-Chain Transfers . This development is certainly one to watch as the Worldcoin ecosystem continues to evolve.

While SHIB keeps surfing on the wave of its loyal fan base and explosive meme-driven movement, most experts are forecasting a 10x return as it continues to gain traction globally. In the meantime, DeFi newcomer Mutuum Finance is building momentum in silence, with initial estimates predicting it could reach new heights with its new take on decentralized finance. At only $0.025 in its Phase 4 presale, MUTM has already gained more than 9,400 investors and raised $7.6 million. With more than 50% of this round already sold out, a 20% price hike to $0.03 is inevitable as Phase 5 draws near. Investors today can expect to make 140% by the time the token goes public at $0.06. These two cryptocurrencies might be your gateway to 10-20x returns. Igniting the DeFi market with an innovative lending model The decentralized finance industry has begun to recognize Mutuum Finance because of its dual lending platform model. Users can easily earn income by placing stablecoins inside smart contract pools through the Peer-to-Contract (P2C) model. Through the Peer-to-Peer (P2P) model people can engage in loan transactions without any middleman involvement. The dual-lending system delivers an adaptable, efficient and decentralized financial design. A comprehensive Certik audit is currently undertaken by Mutuum Finance to establish trust among users. The audit process with its open-source smart contracts focuses on providing maximum transparency while ensuring security so that investor trust will increase as Mutuum expands. Rewarding early investors and growing the ecosystem The project is constructing an active community through incentive-based programs. The existing $100,000 giveaway distributes ten $10,000 MUTM token prizes to contest winners. Users get bonus cryptocurrency tokens through a referral program that drives natural business expansion. Early adopters gain platform upgrade access and new features as a bonus which creates a strong network of loyal devoted investors. Mutuum Finance is also preparing to launch a USD-backed, over-collateralized stablecoin, an answer to the volatility that plagues algorithmic stablecoins. This stablecoin is designed to bring long-term price stability and create a reliable environment for lending and borrowing on the platform. Buy-and-distribute model building long-term value One of the innovations of the platform is its Buy-and-Distribute mechanism. Through this mechanism, Mutuum Finance actively purchases market tokens and redistributes them to stakers so that there is ongoing interaction and the tokenomics of the project are maximized. This mechanism not just manages supply in a smart way, but also offers ongoing rewards, thereby making it suitable for long-term players. In an industry often controlled by volatility and hype, Mutuum Finance is a stabilizing presence founded on sustained utility. Numerous experts evaluate Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Mutuum Finance (MUTM) as two exciting investment opportunities for 2025 since they may deliver potential 10-20x returns in uncertain market conditions. The enormous SHIB user base continues to drive its explosive growth as Mutuum Finance (MUTM) enters Phase 4 of its presale phase at $0.025 while building momentum in DeFi. Mutuum Finance has recently secured $7.6 million from 9,400 investors and is getting closer to a price increase that will initiate Phase 5. Investors who join early can anticipate as much as 140% profit when Mutuum Finance reaches its target price of $0.06. Phase 4 presale completion has almost reached its max capacity as prices will continue to increase before launch. The opportunity to buy MUTM beforehand the upcoming price rise will disappear so enter this investment early.

This is one of the latest retreats in crypto enforcement under the Trump administration. Balina allegedly promoted unregistered securities through an investment pool involving Sparkster (SPRK) tokens. The agency also dropped its investigation into PayPal’s stablecoin PYUSD, with no enforcement action taken. Despite the regulatory clearance, PYUSD is still a minor player with under $1 billion in market cap. Meanwhile, legal accountability is still being pursuedfor other people involved in the crypto space.Avraham Eisenberg was sentenced to over four years in prison for unrelated criminal charges. Further sentencing is also pending for his $100 million Mango Markets exploit. SEC Drops Case Against Ian Balina The US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) moved to dismiss its lawsuit against crypto influencer and YouTuber Ian Balina. Thi sin one of the latest steps in the agency's apparent retreat from aggressive crypto enforcement under the Trump administration. In a joint stipulation that was filed with a federal court in Austin on May 1, the SEC stated that it believes dropping the case is appropriate. It referenced the efforts of its internal Crypto Task Force but offered no specific rationale. The agency also clarified that this dismissal does not imply a shift in its position on other cases. Balina is the CEO of Token Metrics and a well known figure in the crypto space with 140,000 followers on X. He was originally sued by the SEC in 2022 for allegedly promoting unregistered securities. The complaint stemmed from his involvement in forming an investing pool using Sparkster (SPRK) tokens during the 2018 initial coin offering (ICO) craze. An ICO is a fundraising method in the cryptocurrency space where a project sells its native tokens to investors, typically in exchange for Bitcoin, Ethereum, or fiat currency. It's similar to an IPO (Initial Public Offering) in traditional finance but usually happens before the project is fully developed. The SEC argued that Balina’s actions constituted an unregistered securities offering, with US-based investors participating via a network of Ethereum nodes predominantly located in the US. In May of 2024, a court agreed with the SEC, and found that SPRK qualified as an investment contract , thus falling under US securities law. However, in a shift that reflects the changing political climate, the SEC has since rolled back numerous enforcement actions after President Donald Trump’s appointment of former crypto lobbyist Paul Atkins as the agency's chair. Balina suggested in a March interview that the case's dismissal stemmed from a reorientation of agency priorities. He also described the new administration as “pro-crypto.” The SEC and Balina jointly stated that dropping the case will preserve court resources and would not involve any costs or fees to either party. This dismissal is now the latest in a series of abandoned actions against major crypto entities including Coinbase, Ripple, Kraken, and OpenSea. SEC Drops Probe into PayPal’s Stablecoin The US SEC also recently concluded its investigation into PayPal’s US dollar-pegged stablecoin, PYUSD, opting not to pursue any enforcement action. In a regulatory filing that was shared on April 29, PayPal revealed that the SEC’s Division of Enforcement informed the company in February of 2025 that the inquiry was closed. The investigation began with a subpoena in November 2023 requesting documentation related to the stablecoin, and has now officially ended without consequence for the payments giant. PYUSD was launched with the promise of being fully backed and 100% redeemable for US dollars through a mix of cash, cash equivalents, and short-term US Treasuries, and faced some difficulty gaining market share in an industry that is dominated by heavyweights like Tether and Circle. Despite the regulatory clearance, PYUSD holds a market capitalization of just $912 million. This is less than 1% of Tether’s $148.5 billion. On the bright side, it still saw a 75% jump in circulating supply since the start of 2025, according to CoinGecko . That said, it is still very much below its peak of just over $1 billion in August 2024. PYUSD’s all-time market cap (Source: CoinMarketCap ) PayPal is now focusing on growing the stablecoin’s footprint through incentives and partnerships. On April 23, the company introduced a loyalty offering that allows US users to earn 3.7% annually for holding PYUSD. This move is aimed at increasing its utility and adoption. Just a day later, PayPal announced a partnership with Coinbase to help promote PYUSD usage across the crypto ecosystem. PayPal CEO Alex Chriss said that the initiative is part of a broader effort to put PYUSD “at the center” of innovative digital finance solutions. These developments happened alongside strong first-quarter financial results for PayPal. The company exceeded Wall Street expectations, and reported earnings of $1.33 per share against estimates of $1.16, with revenue reaching $7.8 billion. This is up 1% year-over-year. PayPal also completed sizable share repurchases, which signals that there is confidence in its growth strategy. Mango Markets Hacker Jailed Others are not so lucky when it comes to escaping the claws of justice. Avraham Eisenberg was recently sentenced to 52 months in prison for charges related to child sexual abuse material, which is a case separate from his involvement in the 2022 Mango Markets exploit. The sentencing was handed down on May 1 in the US District Court for the Southern District of New York, after Eisenberg’s guilty plea on the child pornography charge. Although the court initially planned to consolidate the sentencing for both the child pornography and Mango Markets fraud cases, the fraud-related sentencing still has to be finalized. Eisenberg was arrested in Puerto Rico in December of 2022, and is also facing a conviction for orchestrating a high-profile exploit of Mango Markets, a decentralized crypto exchange. In October 2022, Eisenberg used a price oracle manipulation tactic to drain approximately $100 million in user funds. The attack caused the exchange’s native token, MNGO, to lose more than half its value in a day, which prompted Mango Markets to suspend deposits and attempt recovery. Post from Eisenberg defending his actions He defended his actions as legal trading strategies and claimed to have negotiated a settlement with the exchange to return part of the stolen funds. Despite this, federal authorities charged Eisenberg with commodities fraud and manipulation, and in April of 2024, a jury found him guilty of wire fraud, commodities fraud, and commodities manipulation. His legal team still argues that the actions did not constitute cybercrime, but rather skillful trading, and have filed a motion for acquittal . Prosecutors, however, hold firm that the conviction was supported by overwhelming evidence. This is one of the cases that proves the increasing accountability for people exploiting vulnerabilities in the crypto industry.",News|Legal,EN,0,0,EXCHANGE|MARKET|REGULATION|PYUSD|TOKEN SALE,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-05-02 13:36:50

But while SHIB’s meme-powered popularity keeps it in the spotlight, a new player, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) , is quietly catching the eyes of seasoned investors. With its strong utility in the DeFi space, some are wondering if MUTM could soon outshine SHIB’s hype-driven highs. Already in Phase 4 of its presale, MUTM has raised over $7.6 million and onboarded more than 9,400 investors. With Phase 4 already over 50% sold out, and a launch price set at $0.06, early investors at $0.025 are looking at a 140% return before the token even hits exchanges. As both tokens push toward their respective milestones, investors are questioning if SHIB can hold off the growing wave of MUTM’s potential. Shiba Inu’s path to $0.0005—is it enough to stay ahead? Price projections for SHIB during the end of 2025 indicate the meme coin will possibly reach between $0.0003 to $0.0005. Shiba Inu relies on its community interest but needs to show sustainability during an active crypto market evolution. Boyata Capital forecasted that SHIB’s price may reach between $0.0003 and $0.0005 by the end of 2025 but investors now need to consider the rising utility of alternative competitors like MUTM. Mutuum Finance: disrupting DeFi with real utility Mutuum Finance brings a distinctive market value as it delivers practical usage capabilities. The core value of Mutuum Finance uses two distinct lending functions which combine Peer-to-Contract (P2C) and Peer-to-Peer (P2P). Through P2C smart contracts the system operates automated lending pools whose interest rates are adjustable. Through its P2P approach the system cuts out all middlemen to let borrowers and lenders maintain complete authority over their lending conditions. Security is another major strength. Mutuum Finance maintains open-source smart contracts which the platform has submitted to third-party audit processes to guarantee security and transparency. Mutuum Finance will later allow for EVM and non-EVM blockchains integration which will make the platform more accessible and increase liquidity potential throughout different blockchain networks. Presale growth and launch price expectations Currently priced at $0.025, the MUTM token is in high demand. Investors who buy in now during Phase 4 will benefit from a 20% price jump once Phase 5 begins. The final launch price is set at $0.06, but some crypto analysts are already predicting that it could reach $3 shortly after going live, an exponential gain from today’s presale levels. These factors make MUTM one of the most talked-about low-cap coins in the DeFi market. Rewarding the community with a $100,000 giveaway Mutuum Finance activates a $100,000 giveaway effort to support early adopters of their platform. The MUTM token giveaway will award ten participants with individual prizes worth $10,000 each. The platform also operates a referral program which gives users bonus rewards for each new investor they refer to the platform thus helping both its organic growth and extended user engagement. Bearers of the top 50 leaderboard positions also obtain bonus token rewards through the platform’s ranking system. Mutuum’s DeFi-first approach, dual lending model, cross-chain capabilities, and strong community incentives have driven over $7.6 million in presale funding from more than 9,400 investors. With Phase 4 already over 50% sold out and a 20% price jump imminent in Phase 5, early buyers at $0.025 could lock in 140% gains even before launch. This is more than a presale, it’s a race against time. As momentum accelerates and the next phase approaches, the opportunity to get in early is rapidly disappearing.

The five, Mitsubishi Corp., Mitsui & Co., Itochu Corp., Marubeni Corp., and Sumitomo Corp., warned this week that earnings for the fiscal year ending March 2026 will take a substantial hit. Two of the firms, Mitsubishi and Mitsui, expect their net profits to decline for a third consecutive year. The others project that Trump tariffs will damage their profits by tens of billions of yen. Profit forecasts drop, but shareholder returns persist Mitsubishi Corp., one of the largest and most profitable of the group, has predicted a 26% drop in net profit for the current fiscal year. The company said the one-time gains from asset sales that had boosted its performance in the previous period are now absent. Yet, the automobile manufacturer announced earlier today that it will raise its dividend by 10 yen to 110 yen ($0.76) per share and will continue with its 1 trillion yen share buyback plan. Speaking to reporters after the earnings call, Chief Executive Officer Katsuya Nakanishi said shareholder support, particularly from Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway, has made Mitsubishi confident about the tariff-clouded future. “ We understand that Warren Buffett has placed trust in our strategy and management approach ,” Nakanishi remarked. Mitsui & Co. told investors to prepare for a difficult year ahead. The company projected full-year net income of 770 billion yen ($5.5 billion), a 15% drop from the previous year and well below analysts’ expectations of 853.3 billion yen. Shares of Mitsui fell nearly 7% in Tokyo following the announcement before trimming losses. In its statement Thursday, Mitsui cited the US’s “expansiveness and high level of increases in tariffs” as a threat to the global economic balance. Itochu Corp. was the lone optimist among the five. Thanks to the strength of its non-resource businesses, the company is targeting a record 900 billion yen net profit for the year. It plans to sustain a shareholder payout ratio of 50% and announced a 150 billion yen buyback, equivalent to 2% of its shares. Meanwhile, Marubeni and Sumitomo each set aside large buffers to absorb potential tariff-related losses. Marubeni allocated 30 billion yen and Sumitomo 40 billion yen in anticipation of headwinds from US trade policy. Marubeni also announced it would distribute 210 billion yen in shareholder returns and buy back up to 4.2% of its stock, amounting to 70 billion yen. Sumitomo will increase its annual dividend from 130 yen to 140 yen and repurchase up to 2.9% of its shares for a total of 80 billion yen. “We are heading into something never experienced.” Sumitomo’s CEO reckoned at a press conference Friday morning. Buffett still confident in Japan investments In his annual letter this year, Buffett reiterated that Berkshire plans to hold its Japanese house stakes “for the very long term.” As reported by Cryptopolitan, the firms had originally agreed not to exceed 10% ownership in each company, but they relaxed that limit in early April to let Buffett and other US investors buy more shares. At the end of 2024, Berkshire’s total cost for these holdings stood at $13.8 billion, with a market value of $23.5 billion. In March, shares of the five trading houses went up after Berkshire disclosed that it had raised its stakes by 1.0% to 1.7% in each company. The firm now owns between 8.5% and 9.8% of each. Meanwhile, the Bank of Japan slashed its economic forecasts on Thursday and now expects Japan’s GDP growth in 2025 to slow down to just 0.5%, down from the 1.1% projection made in January.

Recent analysis from CryptoQuant suggests we might be witnessing the early stages of a significant upward trend for the leading cryptocurrency. Understanding the signals that point towards a potential bull run is crucial for anyone involved in the crypto space. What is the True MVRV Indicator and Why Does it Matter? At the heart of the recent bullish sentiment is the behavior of a specific metric: the annualized True MVRV indicator. This sophisticated tool, utilized by analysts like CryptoQuant’s Axel Adler Jr., offers a refined look at the Market Value to Realized Value ratio. Let’s break down what that means: Market Value (MV): This is essentially the current price of Bitcoin multiplied by the circulating supply. It represents the market’s current valuation of all BTC. Realized Value (RV): This is a different way to value Bitcoin. It calculates the value of all BTC by taking the price at which each coin last moved on the blockchain. Think of it as the average cost basis of all Bitcoin holders. MVRV Ratio: Dividing the Market Value by the Realized Value gives the MVRV ratio. Traditionally, this ratio has been used to gauge whether Bitcoin is overvalued or undervalued relative to the average price at which coins were acquired. High values often suggest the market is overheated (many holders are in significant profit), while low values can indicate undervaluation (many holders are at a loss). True MVRV: This is where the refinement comes in. The True MVRV indicator adjusts the standard MVRV by excluding coins that are considered ‘illiquid’ – those that haven’t moved for a long time and are likely held by long-term investors or lost. This adjustment provides a clearer picture of the market sentiment among more active or recent participants. Annualized True MVRV: Annualizing the True MVRV helps smooth out short-term volatility and provides a longer-term perspective on the trend. When the annualized True MVRV turns positive, as Axel Adler Jr. pointed out, it signals a significant shift. It suggests that, on average, holders who are actively participating in the market are now holding their Bitcoin at a profit, relative to the price they acquired it. This transition from average loss to average profit is a powerful psychological shift in the market. Crypto Analysis: Diminished Panic Selling and Holder Profitability Axel Adler Jr.’s analysis highlights a crucial behavioral change accompanying the positive True MVRV signal: the reduction in panic selling. During bear markets or periods of uncertainty, fear often drives holders to sell their Bitcoin, even at a loss, to prevent further downside. This panic selling can exacerbate price declines. However, as the market matures and more holders find themselves in profit, the urgency to sell out of fear diminishes. Instead, holders become more confident, less likely to sell on minor dips, and more inclined to hold for further gains. This shift in sentiment creates a more stable foundation for price appreciation. The fact that ‘many holders are now in profit’ is not just a statistic; it’s a reflection of improved market health and growing conviction among participants. Is This the Start of a BTC Price Prediction Rally? The core implication of the True MVRV turning positive and panic selling subsiding is the potential for a sustained price rally. Historically, periods where a significant portion of the holder base moves into profit and sentiment turns bullish often precede or coincide with the early phases of a bull market. The analyst suggests that prices are ‘expected to rise further until holders begin cashing in on their gains.’ This points to a classic market dynamic: prices tend to climb as long as buying pressure outweighs selling pressure. As more holders enter profit, some will eventually sell to realize those gains, which can create temporary selling pressure. However, in a burgeoning bull market, new demand often absorbs this selling, allowing the upward trend to continue. This isn’t a precise BTC price prediction for a specific target or date, but rather an indication that the underlying market structure and holder behavior are becoming conducive to upward price movement. It suggests that the path of least resistance for Bitcoin’s price is currently upwards. Bitcoin Indicator: Why is True MVRV a Key Signal? While no single indicator can predict the future with certainty, the True MVRV is considered a valuable Bitcoin indicator because it offers insight into the collective psychology and positioning of Bitcoin holders. Unlike simple price charts, it looks beneath the surface at the cost basis of investors. Here’s why indicators like True MVRV are important: Gauging Market Cycles: MVRV-based indicators have historically helped identify major market tops and bottoms by showing when the average holder is in extreme profit (potential top) or extreme loss (potential bottom). Understanding Holder Behavior: By tracking the average profit/loss of holders, the indicator provides clues about their potential selling pressure or conviction to hold. Filtering Noise: The ‘True’ adjustment attempts to filter out illiquid supply, focusing on the coins that are more likely to be traded, giving a potentially more accurate view of active market sentiment. A positive reading, especially after a period where many holders were at a loss, indicates a fundamental shift in market dynamics, moving from accumulation/capitulation phase towards a potential expansion phase. Actionable Insights for Navigating a Potential Bitcoin Bull Market If the market is indeed entering a Bitcoin bull market phase, what are some considerations for investors and traders? Do Your Own Research: While indicators like True MVRV are powerful tools, they should be used in conjunction with other forms of analysis (technical, fundamental, macroeconomic). Understand Risk Management: Bull markets can be exciting, but volatility remains. Don’t invest more than you can afford to lose. Consider setting stop-losses or having an exit strategy. Long-Term vs. Short-Term: Are you looking to hold for the long term, or trade shorter-term movements? Your strategy will dictate how you respond to market signals. Bull markets generally favor long-term holding, but opportunities for shorter-term trades also arise. Diversification: While Bitcoin often leads, consider how a BTC bull run might impact altcoins and the broader crypto ecosystem. Stay Informed: Continue monitoring key indicators, on-chain data, and market news. Sentiment can shift. This signal from the True MVRV indicator provides a compelling argument for the start of a new bullish cycle, but it’s one piece of a larger puzzle. Future Outlook: What to Watch After This Bitcoin Indicator Signal? With the True MVRV flashing positive, what comes next? Monitoring the continued trend of this and other key indicators will be essential. We should watch for: Sustained Positive MVRV: Does the indicator remain positive and potentially trend higher? A sustained move further into profitable territory would reinforce the bullish case. Increased Demand: Look for signs of growing buying pressure, potentially from both retail and institutional investors. Price Action Confirmation: Does the price itself confirm the indicator’s signal by breaking through key resistance levels and establishing a clear upward trend? Macroeconomic Environment: Global economic conditions, inflation data, interest rates, and regulatory news can still significantly impact the crypto market. The signal from the True MVRV indicator is a strong suggestion, but the market’s path is never guaranteed. However, for those watching for signs of the next major upward move, this indicator’s behavior is undoubtedly a reason for optimism. Conclusion: A Powerful Signal for the Next Bitcoin Bull Market Phase The analysis by CryptoQuant’s Axel Adler Jr., highlighting the annualized True MVRV indicator turning positive, offers a compelling piece of evidence suggesting that Bitcoin may be entering the early phase of a bull market. This shift signifies improved market sentiment, reduced panic selling, and a significant portion of holders now being in profit. While no single indicator is definitive, the True MVRV has a historical track record of aligning with major market turning points. This signal provides a strong foundation for the expectation of further price increases as long as this positive sentiment and holder confidence persist. Investors should view this as a significant development, but continue to apply diligent research and risk management as they navigate the potentially exciting times ahead in the crypto market.

44068877,https://blog.bitfinex.com/?p=25109,1746193321,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/99/default.png,Is Panama the Next Hotspot for Crypto Adoption?,https://blog.bitfinex.com/education/is-panama-the-next-hotspot-for-crypto-adoption/,"Panama is steadily positioning itself as a leading destination for digital asset innovation, leveraging its historic role as a financial hub and adapting its regulatory environment to attract entrepreneurs and investors. Through voluntary crypto payment initiatives, licensing frameworks for virtual asset providers, and integration of digital assets into public services, Panama offers a flexible and business-friendly alternative to other financial centres. Events like Panama Blockchain Week 2025 have further showcased the country’s ambitions, drawing international attention to its growing crypto ecosystem. While challenges remain in balancing innovation with regulatory oversight, Panama’s strategic location, favourable tax policies, and evolving legal frameworks suggest it is well on its way to becoming a significant player in the global digital economy. Is Another Global Financial Centre Embracing Digital Assets? Panama has long held a strategic role as a global financial centre, known historically for its banking secrecy laws and favourable tax policies. In recent years, the country has begun positioning itself as an emerging destination for cryptocurrency innovation, adapting its regulatory environment to welcome Bitcoin and digital asset businesses. While Panama has not embraced Bitcoin in the same way El Salvador has, new legislative efforts, including the voluntary acceptance of crypto payments for municipal services, indicate a growing openness to integrating digital assets into its economy. The country’s territorial tax system, lack of capital gains tax on crypto, and relatively light regulatory touch make it particularly attractive for investors and entrepreneurs seeking a flexible financial base. The government has introduced several initiatives aimed at encouraging adoption, while ensuring compliance with international standards on anti-money laundering and financial transparency. Bills such as Law No. 129 and subsequent proposals have created frameworks for licensing virtual asset service providers (VASPs) and recognising digital assets for payment and commercial use. Though previous legislative efforts faced political hurdles, ongoing reforms seek to balance innovation with oversight. Panama City, in particular, has led by example, recently approving Bitcoin and stablecoin payments for taxes and permits through partnerships with local banks, showcasing practical, government-backed use cases for cryptocurrency. This regulatory evolution has coincided with a noticeable influx of wealthy digital nomads, crypto entrepreneurs, and remote workers seeking to establish a base in Panama. The country’s combination of modern infrastructure, access to both the Caribbean and Pacific coasts, relatively low cost of living, and lifestyle freedoms has made it an increasingly popular choice. Real estate markets in areas like Casco Viejo and Bocas del Toro have adapted, with properties increasingly marketed and sold in Bitcoin or through smart contract arrangements, appealing to buyers accustomed to blockchain-based transactions. Beyond real estate and finance, Panama’s growing crypto scene is being supported by a vibrant community of developers, investors, and innovators, reinforced by regular meetups, conferences, and workshops. New businesses are leveraging Panama’s relaxed environment to experiment with Decentralised Applications (DApps) and blockchain-based services. As Panama continues to refine its legal frameworks and cultivate a crypto-friendly reputation, it is steadily transitioning from a traditional offshore banking hub to a dynamic destination for the next generation of digital economy participants. Panama’s Blockchain Week Was a Resounding Success Panama Blockchain Week 2025 , held from April 22nd to 24th at the Panama Convention Center, marked a significant milestone in the country’s ambition to establish itself as a major hub for blockchain innovation in Latin America. Over three days, the event attracted a diverse audience of entrepreneurs, developers, investors, and government representatives, all gathered to explore crypto’s growing role in finance, governance, and technology. Structured around thematic blocks, such as education, investment, business, and leisure, the conference offered a wide array of panels, workshops, and exhibitions, showcasing both established projects and emerging startups across the Web3 ecosystem. The opening day featured a VIP financial summit focused on anti-money laundering challenges, setting the stage for high-level conversations between policymakers and industry leaders. Subsequent sessions included a Blockchain Congress and an Investor’s Night hosted at Zielo , providing startups with a platform to present their initiatives to potential backers. The final day expanded on educational and sector-specific applications of digital assets, culminating in a Caribbean-themed closing celebration. Throughout the event, speakers, including President José Raúl Mulino and executives from major financial institutions, emphasised Panama’s growing role in bridging traditional finance and decentralised technologies. Beyond the official programming, Panama Blockchain Week highlighted the country’s broader strategic efforts to create a favourable environment for digital innovation. Recent regulatory developments, including the voluntary acceptance of cryptocurrencies for municipal payments and the introduction of licensing frameworks for virtual asset service providers, were recurrent themes during discussions. These measures, combined with Panama’s established reputation as a financial centre, were seen as critical in attracting global blockchain businesses and fostering a collaborative, forward-looking ecosystem. Overall, the event not only served as a forum for showcasing technological advances but also as a reflection of Panama’s evolving economic strategy. By leveraging its geographic position, legal reforms, and growing crypto-savvy workforce, Panama aims to position itself at the intersection of finance, technology, and innovation. Panama Blockchain Week 2025 reinforced the country’s intention to play a leading role in the digital transformation of Latin America, signalling both opportunity and a commitment to responsible development in the digital assets space. Will Panama’s Progressive Stance on Digital Assets Draw Entrepreneurs from Around the World? Panama’s increasingly open stance toward digital assets places it in a competitive position among the world’s emerging crypto hubs. By adopting a model that encourages voluntary crypto payments, establishes a licensing framework for virtual asset service providers, and embraces innovation in public administration, Panama signals its intention to become a welcoming environment for entrepreneurs. At the same time, Panama has taken a flexible approach, allowing businesses and individuals to choose whether to engage with digital currencies. This pragmatic model could appeal to a broader range of entrepreneurs who prefer regulatory clarity without compulsory adoption. In comparison to Switzerland’s well-established “Crypto Valley” in Zug, Panama still has considerable work to do in terms of building a fully mature ecosystem. Switzerland’s regulatory environment is distinguished by clear, comprehensive frameworks for everything from token classifications to banking services, offering entrepreneurs a high degree of legal certainty. However, Panama offers advantages such as lower operating costs, favourable territorial tax policies, and a strategic geographic location bridging North and South America. While it may not yet rival Switzerland in institutional depth, Panama’s lighter regulatory touch and lifestyle perks are likely to attract younger entrepreneurs, digital nomads, and startups looking for agility rather than heavy compliance obligations. Malta and Singapore offer additional points of contrast. Malta gained early attention for its ambitious digital asset regulations but faced criticism over inconsistent enforcement and concerns from international financial regulators. Singapore, by contrast, has developed into a global financial centre for digital assets, with stringent but predictable licensing regimes that attract major exchanges and institutional players. Panama’s middle-ground approach, offering a regulatory structure without overly burdensome oversight, positions it closer to Malta’s original vision but with a growing awareness of the need to maintain international credibility. For entrepreneurs prioritising flexibility, Panama could present a more attractive alternative to Singapore’s tighter compliance environment, especially for smaller firms and experimental projects. Ultimately, whether Panama succeeds in drawing a global influx of crypto entrepreneurs will depend on how effectively it balances innovation with regulatory discipline. Its efforts to integrate digital assets into public services, promote financial inclusion through crypto adoption, and maintain a business-friendly tax structure align with trends favouring decentralisation and autonomy. However, it must also ensure that its regulatory frameworks continue to evolve in ways that satisfy both domestic priorities and international standards. If Panama can manage this balancing act, it is well-positioned to become a major destination alongside other leading jurisdictions in the digital asset economy.

In its latest move, the FCA has published a discussion paper to gather public views before it begins regulating key parts of the crypto industry. This signals that clear rules for crypto in the UK may be coming soon—something many in the industry have been waiting for. What Is the FCA Focusing On? The FCA is not rushing into regulation without hearing from the people first. The discussion paper is focused on some of the most important and sometimes risky areas of the crypto space: Intermediaries (like exchanges and wallet providers) Staking, lending, and borrowing of crypto Decentralized finance (DeFi) platforms The use of credit to buy crypto, which has been rising The FCA wants to know whether stricter rules should be applied, especially when people are borrowing money to invest in crypto, a move that can be very risky if markets crash. Building a Safer Crypto Environment David Geale, the FCA’s executive director for payments and digital finance, explained that the goal is to create a balanced approach. The FCA wants to encourage innovation in the crypto space, but without putting consumers at risk or weakening market trust. The idea is simple, crypto is here to stay, so regulation must grow alongside it, not shut it down. A Step-by-Step Roadmap This paper is part of a wider plan called the Crypto Roadmap . It outlines when and how future rules will be introduced. Topics include: Market abuse protections Stablecoin rules Crypto custody and safekeeping How crypto firms manage their risks This step also follows draft legislation from the UK Treasury, which aims to give the FCA official power over crypto regulation. Deadline For The Feedback The FCA is now inviting everyone, from industry experts to ordinary crypto users, to share their views by 13 June 2025. After that, it plans to review all responses and launch a formal consultation later this year. It all ties into the FCA’s new five-year strategy that focuses on smarter regulation, sustainable economic growth, and protecting consumers in an evolving financial landscape.",News,EN,0,0,MARKET|REGULATION,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-05-02 13:44:52

Rio, the 18th Tezos Protocol Upgrade, is Live Blockchain platform Tezos has successfully activated Rio , its 18 th protocol upgrade. The team activated the upgrade after an on-chain voting and governance process, introducing several changes that make staking on Tezos more flexible, the announcement says. This is also a move towards the adoption of the Data Availability Layer (DAL), a critical component for boosting Layer 2 scalability. The Tezos DAL was activated on Mainnet with the Paris protocol upgrade in 2024, designed to significantly increase (by up to 4,000x) the amount of transaction data that can be published on-chain and lower costs for rollups like Etherlink . Rio also adjusts Tezos’ rewards model to support and incentivize maintaining its security and integrity. Rio, the 18th Tezos protocol upgrade, is live!

Moreover, to ensure smooth L1 network operation, the Rio upgrade introduces stricter baker inactivity thresholds, the team says. Unresponsive bakers are now marked as inactive after two days, losing their consensus rights until they rejoin.

The move coincides with his increased lobbying efforts in Washington, D.C., aimed at influencing crypto regulation as pro-crypto sentiment grows under former President Donald Trump’s allies, according to CNBC reporting . Speaking at the Token2049 conference in Dubai, Ardoino emphasized that the upcoming domestic stablecoin would be separate from Tether’s ( USDT ) existing international products. He said the launch could happen by year-end or early 2025, depending on the outcome of pending legislation.

His efforts appear to align with the GOP’s GENIUS Act, which could ease U.S. operations for foreign stablecoin issuers that cooperate with law enforcement. Tether, headquartered in El Salvador, has a checkered history with regulators. In 2021, it paid $18.5 million to settle claims it misled the New York attorney general about its reserves. Today, the company claims it holds nearly $120 billion in U.S. Treasuries, overseen by Cantor Fitzgerald. Its Q1 audit showed it had $5.6 billion in excess reserves, down from $7 billion at year-end. The firm’s U.S. expansion coincides with news that Eric and Donald Trump Jr. plan to launch their own dollar-backed stablecoin through a venture linked to their father’s political brand, potentially setting the stage for a domestic stablecoin arms race.

The higher valuation is now under active negotiation, according to Bloomberg sources. If confirmed, the deal would shift the balance of power in the global stablecoin market. Ripple’s move to acquire Circle would give it control of USDC, the world’s second-largest stablecoin. The timing of the proposed deal comes as Circle is cautious after filing an IPO application in the U.S. Crypto lawyer Bill Morgan hinted that Ripple’s RLUSD token launch may be a precursor to this acquisition attempt. RLUSD is a compliant, enterprise stablecoin meant to be embedded into Ripple’s global payment system. Crypto influencer Crypto Eri described the move as an aggressive market consolidation. “Ripple buying Circle is not for the financials,” she said, citing a larger ambition to buy out Circle’s infrastructure and limit smaller rivals. Ripple buying Circle is not for the financials. It Curbs Competition: Controls USDC, dominates the stablecoin market, sidelines smaller rivals, and takes over Circle’s Payment Network that will be FUELED by an IPO. How much is that worth❓ A lot. Second offer incoming IMO.🏁 pic.twitter.com/xTWDWhm8qt — 🌸Crypto Eri ~ Carpe Diem (@sentosumosaba) May 1, 2025 Dave Schwartz, Ripple CTO, added to the speculation by lightheartedly responding to the amount on the bid, noting, “$6 billion, but that’s our final offer.” The comment, while funny, came at a critical moment when Ripple was eagerly discussing its growing appetite for acquisitions. Ripple accusation spree This comes as Ripple acquired Hidden Road for $1.25bn last month as part of a broader strategy. Hidden Road is a non-bank prime brokerage that processes $3 trillion per year for over 300 institutional clients. Ripple noted that the deal would help Hidden Road scale infrastructure, using its balance sheet to expand global clearing services. Upon finalization, the acquisition would make Ripple the only crypto-native company with a global multi-asset prime broker. This strengthens Ripple’s role in mainstream finance and sets the stage for institutional trading of digital assets like XRP. Pro crypto attorney John Deaton stated that Hidden Road’s scale and influence may make Ripple a dominant force in crypto prime brokerage. RLUSD integration signals broader utility shift The launch of RLUSD is in line with Ripple’s bid for Circle and further underlines its stablecoin push. RLUSD offers dual functionality in Ripple’s payment and investment ecosystem and serves both institutional payment needs and DeFi access. RLUSD is integrated directly into Ripple Payments, providing faster and less expensive cross-border settlements. This addition is designed to distinguish it from other stablecoins, with particular regard to compliance and real-world adoption. Currently, its market capitalization has gone over the $300 million mark. Ripple has expanded RLUSD’s reach to the Middle East, a region now known for the fast adoption of blockchain technologies. According to the company, 40% of regional enterprises currently use Ripple for digital asset custody. RLUSD’s compliance-first design aligns with regulations on the local level, allowing Ripple to strengthen its relationship with institutional partners through their trust. Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse has hinted at his company’s IPO and said its 2024 valuation of $11 billion is outdated. A successful IPO or significant legal clarity would be needed before any acquisition of Circle. Any potential Circle acquisition is still in the shadow of Ripple’s legal mess with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. As the SEC lawsuit nears an end, clarity around Ripple’s regulatory status is crucial in boosting further growth. After the deal gets finalized, Ripple will have the most control over two prominent stablecoins in RLUSD and USDC, as well as institutional clearing and global payment rails. This would position Ripple in the middle of the emerging digital finance ecosystem. Cryptopolitan Academy: Want to grow your money in 2025? Learn how to do it with DeFi in our upcoming webclass.

Ripple’s Partner Just Partnered Circle,https://timestabloid.com/weird-coincidence-ripples-partner-just-partnered-circle/,"The fintech world is once again buzzing with intrigue following a significant announcement: Onafriq, Africa’s largest digital payments network, has entered into a partnership with Circle, the issuer of the USDC stablecoin. While this development is notable in its own right, the news has sparked even greater curiosity due to a potentially strategic alignment. Ripple, which has an existing partnership with Onafriq, is also reportedly pursuing an acquisition of Circle. This chain of events— highlighted by crypto commentator Amelie on X—has fueled fresh speculation about whether this convergence of partnerships is more than just a coincidence. BREAKING: ONAFRIQ HAS PARTNERED WITH CIRCLE! RIPPLE ALSO ALREADY PARTNERED WITH ONAFRIQ & NOW RIPPLE MADE AN ACQUISITION ORDER TO CIRCLE? WEIRD COINCIDENCE AGAIN #XRP https://t.co/hKAG7kPFYZ pic.twitter.com/wdVkpl31Vn — 𝓐𝓶𝓮𝓵𝓲𝓮 (@_Crypto_Barbie) May 2, 2025 Onafriq Expands Reach with Circle Onafriq’s new alliance with Circle marks a decisive step in expanding blockchain-powered financial inclusion across the African continent. With Circle’s USDC increasingly being integrated into global payment systems, the partnership promises to accelerate cross-border transaction capabilities, lower remittance costs, and enhance financial connectivity between African markets and the rest of the world. Circle’s collaboration with Onafriq is expected to leverage stablecoin infrastructure to support real-time, dollar-based settlements. This development is especially impactful in regions where access to traditional banking infrastructure is limited and where local currencies often experience high volatility. Ripple’s Established Relationship with Onafriq Ripple’s involvement with Onafriq dates back to late 2023 when the two firms partnered to enable cross-border payments between Africa and markets such as the UK, Gulf nations, and Australia using Ripple’s blockchain-powered liquidity services. This earlier collaboration positioned Onafriq as a critical hub in Ripple’s global payments ecosystem, highlighting its importance in addressing the historically underserved African payments corridor. Ripple’s technology, particularly its On-Demand Liquidity (ODL) product, enables efficient value transfer by leveraging XRP as a bridge currency . With Onafriq acting as a payment aggregator with access to 400 million mobile wallets and over 130 banks across 40 African countries, the synergies with Ripple were immediately clear. Acquisition Talks: Ripple and Circle Layered onto these partnerships is the recent revelation that Ripple may be eyeing Circle for acquisition. While reports suggest Ripple’s offer valued Circle at around $5 billion —a figure that aligns with Circle’s current IPO valuation—many have speculated about the strategic intent behind such a move. Circle controls a major share of the regulated stablecoin market via USDC , and any potential acquisition would immediately give Ripple a key role in the global stablecoin infrastructure. If successful, the acquisition could allow Ripple to complement its XRP-based liquidity offerings with dollar-backed stablecoin settlement rails. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 The overlap in partnerships—Onafriq with Ripple, Onafriq with Circle, and now Ripple’s potential interest in Circle—has raised eyebrows and prompted speculation about a larger strategic blueprint at play. As Amelie noted in her post, it feels less like a coincidence and more like a convergence with purpose. A New Global Payments Nexus? What emerges is a complex yet compelling picture: three entities—Ripple, Circle, and Onafriq—each bringing unique strengths to the table, now linked through formal partnerships and potential acquisitions. Together, they could be building the foundation for a seamless, inclusive, and interoperable global payments infrastructure—one that spans developed markets and emerging economies alike. This triad of partnerships could prove transformative for cross-border payments, especially in Africa, a continent often left behind in legacy finance but increasingly positioned at the forefront of fintech innovation. As the dust settles on these developments, the industry will be watching closely to see whether Ripple’s acquisition bid materializes—and how the Ripple-Circle-Onafriq dynamic evolves in shaping the next era of blockchain-based finance.

Appetite for global risk assets such as Bitcoin ( BTC ) may take another hit, with analysts from Apollo Global Management predicting a recession by the summer. “Apollo predicting Summer Recession: Sharpest decline in earnings outlook since 2020,” cross-asset analyst Samantha LaDuc wrote in an April 26 X post . The progress on the tariff negotiations may be the most significant factor impacting a potential recession and Bitcoin’s price trajectory, according to Aurelie Barthere, principal research analyst at crypto intelligence platform Nansen. Source: Samantha LaDuc “May is seen as pivotal as Chinese shipments reach the US’s shores, and exemptions on some tariff categories such as auto parts and sub-USD-800 shipments from China/ Hong Kong expire,” Barthere told Cointelegraph, adding that a lack of negotiations in May could lead to an economic recession and “double-digit losses” for Bitcoin. However, this is the least likely scenario, since neither China nor the US “ has an economic interest in the interruption of bilateral trade,” Barthere said, adding: “Given this, the main tariff scenario is for the US reaching deals or at least ‘agreements in principle’ with its main trade partners, probably settling around the 10% reciprocal tariff ‘floor’.” If that scenario plays out and trade tensions ease in May, Bitcoin is likely to revisit its all-time high, Barthere said. The US has “proactively reached out to China through multiple channels,” for signaling its openness for tariff negotiations, Reuters reported on May 1, citing unnamed sources who spoke to state-affiliated Chinese media platform Yuyuan Tantian.

Yet, its increased correlation with the stock market, particularly tech stocks, introduces uncertainty,” said Lian, adding that crypto investors should continue monitoring economic policy shifts to gauge market direction. BTC/USD, 1-week chart, 2020-2021. Source: Cointelegraph/ TradingView However, Bitcoin’s increasing correlation with tech stocks adds uncertainty to that outlook. Following the COVID-19 crash in March 2020, Bitcoin surged more than 1,050%, climbing from $6,000 to an all-time high of $69,000 in November 2021. That rally came after the Federal Reserve launched its $4 trillion asset purchase program in March 2020. Related: Bitcoin to $1M by 2029 fueled by ETF and gov’t demand — Bitwise exec Other industry watchers remain concerned by the crypto market’s response to economic stagnation. “If the analysts are correct about the recession (which is certainly not guaranteed), crypto markets will likely decline alongside broader risk-on assets and equities,” according to Marcin Kazmierczak, co-founder and chief operating officer of blockchain oracle firm RedStone. Kazmierczak said April’s “Liberation Day tariffs and trucking slowdown could create economic contagion that historically hits speculative assets hardest.” “While crypto’s growing institutional adoption introduces some uncertainty, it’s not enough to overcome the fundamental risk-on classification that still dominates market behavior,” he added.

44069188,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=154645,1746193844,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Crucial Forex Market Test: US Dollar Slips Ahead of Payrolls,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/dollar-slips-forex-test/,"In the ever-watchful world of global finance, where macro trends often dictate the rhythm of markets, the recent performance of major currencies offers a compelling narrative. For those keeping an eye on everything from traditional assets to cryptocurrencies, understanding these shifts is key. The US Dollar has been experiencing a notable dip, sliding against several counterparts, particularly as market participants brace for significant upcoming economic releases. Meanwhile, the Euro has shown resilience, bolstered by recent positive indicators. This currency dynamic sets the stage for what could be a pivotal period, heavily influenced by fresh Economic Data . Why is the US Dollar Under Pressure? The greenback’s recent softness isn’t happening in a vacuum. Several factors contribute to its current stance: Changing Interest Rate Expectations: Markets have been adjusting their outlook on when and how much the Federal Reserve might cut interest rates this year. Softer inflation prints or signs of a cooling labor market can lead traders to anticipate earlier or larger rate cuts, which typically weighs on a currency. Relative Economic Performance: While the US economy remains robust, data from other regions is sometimes exceeding expectations, narrowing the perceived growth differential that previously favored the Dollar. Risk Sentiment: At times, improved global risk sentiment can lead investors to move funds out of traditional safe-haven assets like the US Dollar and into higher-yielding or riskier assets. The market’s focus is laser-sharp on upcoming data that could either confirm or challenge these expectations, making the Dollar’s position particularly sensitive right now. What’s Boosting the Euro Right Now? Across the Atlantic, the Euro has found a footing, managing to gain ground against the weaker Dollar. A significant driver behind this strength has been recent positive economic surveys. Stronger PMI Data: Purchasing Managers’ Index (PMI) data from the Eurozone has recently painted a more optimistic picture of economic activity in both manufacturing and services sectors. Improved business sentiment and activity levels suggest potential economic recovery or stabilization. Inflation Trends: While inflation is cooling in the Eurozone, the pace and future path of interest rate cuts by the European Central Bank (ECB) are also being closely watched. Data suggesting inflation might be stickier than initially thought could lead to expectations of later rate cuts, supporting the Euro. Reduced Political Risk: While geopolitical factors always loom, a period of relative calm on certain fronts can also allow economic fundamentals to play a more prominent role in currency valuation. The combination of better-than-expected survey data and evolving central bank narratives is providing tailwinds for the single currency, contrasting with the pressures facing the US Dollar . Anticipating Non-Farm Payrolls : The Big Event If there’s one piece of Economic Data that consistently moves the Forex Market , it’s the US Non-Farm Payrolls (NFP) report. This monthly release provides crucial insights into the health of the US labor market, covering employment figures outside of the agricultural sector. Why is NFP so important? Indicator of Economic Health: Strong job growth signals a healthy economy with consumers earning and spending, while weak numbers can suggest a slowdown. Inflationary Pressures: Wage growth data included in the report is a key indicator of potential inflationary pressures. Fed Policy Influence: The Federal Reserve watches NFP closely when making decisions about interest rates. A strong labor market might allow the Fed to keep rates higher for longer, while weakness could prompt cuts. The market is currently positioned with some anticipation of a cooling in the labor market. A report that significantly deviates from these expectations – either much stronger or much weaker – could trigger substantial volatility in the US Dollar and across the Forex Market . How Does This Impact the Broader Forex Market ? The dynamics between the US Dollar and the Euro are central to the entire Forex Market . The EUR/USD pair is the most heavily traded currency pair globally, and its movements ripple across other pairs. Here’s how: Scenario Potential USD Impact Potential EUR Impact Broader Market Effect Strong US NFP USD strengthens EUR weakens (relative) Risk-off sentiment may increase, other currencies weaken vs USD Weak US NFP USD weakens EUR strengthens (relative) Risk-on sentiment may increase, other currencies strengthen vs USD Strong Eurozone PMIs USD weakens (relative) EUR strengthens May support other European currencies, impact cross rates Traders are actively positioning themselves based on their expectations for the NFP data, leading to cautious trading ahead of the release. The outcome will likely set the tone for currency movements in the days and weeks that follow, influencing everything from major pairs like GBP/USD and USD/JPY to emerging market currencies. Navigating Market Volatility: Insights from Recent Economic Data The current environment, characterized by a weaker US Dollar and a firmer Euro driven by contrasting data signals, highlights the importance of monitoring Economic Data releases. For anyone involved in financial markets, including the crypto space which can be sensitive to global liquidity and risk appetite shifts, understanding these macro drivers is essential. Key takeaways from the current situation: Data is King: Upcoming releases, especially the NFP, are primary catalysts for market movement. Divergence Matters: Differences in economic performance and central bank outlooks between regions (like the US and Eurozone) create trading opportunities but also volatility. Positioning Ahead of Events: Markets tend to consolidate or show hesitant moves ahead of major data, followed by sharp reactions upon release. Staying informed about the economic calendar and understanding the potential implications of key data points is crucial for navigating the current market landscape effectively. The stage is set for a potentially volatile period in the Forex Market . The US Dollar faces a significant test with the release of the Non-Farm Payrolls report, while the Euro looks to build on recent positive momentum from Economic Data . The outcome of these data points will not only shape currency pairs like EUR/USD but will also send signals across the broader financial ecosystem, influencing sentiment and asset flows well beyond traditional forex trading.

While the entire crypto market is slowing down and moving sideways, ADA is now struggling to hold its ground. The token is now trading just above a key support level of $0.66, and if it fails to hold, a sharper drop around $0.50 could be next. So, what’s going on with ADA? Bears Are Gaining Strength According to the T HEDEFILINK, a core DeFi Researcher , one of the biggest warning signs is coming from the Elder-Ray Index, a tool that tracks the battle between buyers and sellers. Right now, the buyers are backing off. Each day, the signal weakens, which suggests that sellers are slowly taking control. This kind of setup often shows up before a price reversal. Another red flag is the Chaikin Money Flow (CMF), which tracks how money moves in and out of an asset. For ADA, the CMF is negative, sitting at -0.09, and it has stayed there all week. This tells us that more money is leaving ADA than coming in, showing that sellers are in charge for now. $0.66 – A Critical Level to Watch As of now, ADA is hanging around $0.71 , just above the $0.66 support level. Meanwhile, analysts warn that ADA could revisit its yearly low of $0.50 if it falls below the support level.

European Union to ban anonymous crypto and privacy tokens by 2027 The European Union is set to impose sweeping AML rules that will ban privacy-preserving tokens and anonymous cryptocurrency accounts from 2027. Under the new Anti-Money Laundering Regulation (AMLR), credit institutions, financial institutions and crypto asset service providers (CASPs) will be prohibited from maintaining anonymous accounts or handling privacy-preserving cryptocurrencies, such as Monero ( XMR ) and Zcash ( ZEC ). “Article 79 of the AMLR establishes strict prohibitions on anonymous accounts [...]. Credit institutions, financial institutions, and crypto-asset service providers are prohibited from maintaining anonymous accounts,” according to the AML Handbook, published by European Crypto Initiative (EUCI). The AML Handbook. Source: EUCI The regulation is part of a broader AML framework that includes bank and payment accounts, passbooks and safe-deposit boxes, “crypto-asset accounts allowing anonymisation of transactions,” and “accounts using anonymity-enhancing coins.” US wants to cut off Huione over crypto crime The US Treasury Department’s Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) on May 1 proposed blocking the Cambodia-based Huione Group from the US banking system, accusing it of helping North Korea’s state-backed Lazarus Group to launder crypto. Huione Group comprises a network of businesses, which includes payment service platform Huione Pay PLC, the crypto exchange Huione Crypto, and Haowang Guarantee, an online marketplace offering illicit goods and services. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said the conglomerate established itself as the “marketplace of choice for malicious cyber actors” like the Lazarus Group, who have “stolen billions of dollars from everyday Americans.” Source: Chainalysis FinCEN said Huione laundered at least $4 billion worth of illicit proceeds between August 2021 and January 2025, including over $36 million from crypto pig butchering scams and $37 million worth of crypto for North Korea. It has also created a US dollar-pegged stablecoin, the US Dollar Huione (USDH), which FinCEN said cannot be frozen and helps to carry out money laundering activities. The proposed rule is subject to a 30-day public comment period before it can take effect. Coinbase suspends trading for MOVE token Crypto exchange Coinbase has announced it will suspend trading of the Movement Network token (MOVE), the native cryptocurrency of the Movement layer-2 blockchain protocol, developed by Movement Labs, effective May 15. The decision was shared in a May 1 X post , with Coinbase citing the token’s failure to meet its listing standards. The price of the MOVE token also declined by approximately 14.5% in the last 24 hours. Coinbase specified the details of the suspension in an announcement : ""Trading for MOVE will be suspended on Coinbase, Simple and Advanced Trade, Coinbase Exchange, and Coinbase Prime. We have moved our MOVE order books to limit-only mode. Limit orders can be placed and canceled, and matches may occur."" The suspension of the token follows a recently announced third-party review orchestrated by the Movement Network Foundation into an agreement allegedly signed by Movement Labs and a market-making firm, which is said to be behind the downfall of the MOVE token price in December 2024. Source: Coinbase Assets A Movement Network Foundation spokesperson recently confirmed to Cointelegraph that the third-party investigation , which commenced on April 21, is ongoing. The investigation is being conducted by Groom Lake, an independent cybersecurity and intelligence firm, and has cast a cloud over the MOVE token's price.",Trump memecoin|Solana memecoin|TRUMP token|Solana|SOL|Nova Labs|SEC|Securities and Exchange Commission|crypto regulation|TRUMP rally|Bitcoin,EN,0,0,ADA|ALTCOIN|ASIA|AVAX|BCH|BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|BUSINESS|DOGE|ETH|EXCHANGE|FIAT|ICO|LINK|MARKET|MATIC|MINING|REGULATION|SOL|SPONSORED|TECHNOLOGY|TRADING|UNI|USDT|XRP|ZRX|RESEARCH|APT|ARB|BNB|FDUSD|TON|USDC|ENA|ZK|WLD|OM|KAVA|ARKM,"{'name': 'CoinTelegraph', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cointelegraph.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cointelegraph,2025-05-02 13:56:04

Here’s What Happened,https://timestabloid.com/300-million-xrp-vanish-in-48-hours-heres-what-happened/,"XRP’s network fundamentals are showing signs of fatigue as transactional momentum continues to fade. One of the most telling indicators—the volume of payments transacted between addresses on the XRP Ledger—has been on a clear downtrend throughout April. After surging to over 800 million XRP early in the month, a secondary high near 500 million XRP was recorded in the weeks that followed. However, by April 30, that figure had dipped to just 527 million XRP, confirming a consistent decrease in payment throughput. Slumping Ledger Activity Raises Red Flags This waning activity doesn’t necessarily signal immediate danger for XRP , but it does raise caution for short-term price prospects. Historically, the payment volume on the XRP Ledger has been a barometer of real-world utility and adoption. Diminished activity in this metric can imply reduced participation from both institutional players and retail users, typically a bearish signal when left unaddressed over time. While price and on-chain metrics don’t always move in lockstep, sustained declines in network engagement often translate into weaker momentum for asset valuation. Technical Setup Points to Impending Move Currently, XRP is holding at approximately $2.13, perched at the convergence of rising support and descending resistance trendline. This wedge-like technical formation , which has narrowed over several weeks, is now nearing a resolution point—typically an early signal for a breakout or breakdown. However, the indicators are not yet leaning decisively bullish. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) has softened to around 53, indicating neutrality and diminishing buying pressure. Meanwhile, attempts to break above the $2.20 ceiling have repeatedly fallen short, further highlighting market indecision. The exponential moving averages (EMAs) are tightly compressed and offer no clear directional bias. Volume remains light, underscoring a lack of conviction from market participants. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Possible Scenarios: Breakdown vs. Breakout If XRP fails to hold above the current ascending support just above $2.13, a quick dip toward $2.00—or even the $1.98 area—is plausible. This would reflect a rejection of resistance and reinforce the prevailing consolidation pattern. The recent erosion in on-chain payment activity—amounting to a roughly 300 million XRP decline—is especially noteworthy when paired with tepid technical signals. A Period of Consolidation, Not Capitulation At this stage, XRP appears to be consolidating rather than preparing for an immediate breakout. Unless there’s a decisive push above $2.20 supported by renewed trading volume and a rebound in on-chain utility, the market may be setting up for a short-term retracement. While not inherently bearish in the long run, the current conditions suggest that investors should exercise patience and wait for a more conclusive signal before expecting the next leg up.

The latest news at this point came from Movement Labs. Following Coinbase’s delisting decision, Movement Labs announced that it has suspended its co-founder Rushi Manche over the market manipulation scandal. This decision comes just hours after Coinbase announced that it would be suspending MOVE trading starting May 15. Movement Labs, the company behind the MOVE token, has announced that its co-founder Rushi Manche has been suspended from the organization following a market-making scandal. The statement added that the restraining order would remain in effect pending the results of an investigation conducted by third-party organization Groom Lake. “This decision was made in light of ongoing events and the ongoing third-party review by Groom Lake regarding recent events involving corporate governance and the market maker.” The Scandal Was Explained by Binance! The incident was first revealed by Binance, which found that a large portion of the MOVE token was sold by a market maker named Rentech, who claimed to be affiliated with Web3Port. Binance later revealed that the market maker manipulated the price of MOVE. Related News: Attention Investors! Binance Banned This Altcoin's Market Maker! $38 Million Support Came From The Altcoin Team! Binance later said that the MOVE market maker made a net profit of $38 million by selling 66 million MOVE tokens and decided to remove it from the exchange. Following Binance’s move, Movement Labs also took action and hired an auditing firm called Groom Lake to examine the incidents in detail. The company launched an investigation and announced that it will share all findings with the public. MOVE fell more than 20 percent in the last 24 hours to $0.19. We confirm that Rushi Manche has been suspended from Movement Labs. This decision was made in light of ongoing events and as the third-party review is still being conducted by Groom Lake regarding organizational governance and recent incidents involving a market maker. — Movement (@movementlabsxyz) May 2, 2025 *This is not investment advice.

This ADA Rival Is Attracting More Investors,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/should-investors-buy-cardano-before-it-enters-bullrun-this-ada-rival-is-attracting-more-investors/,"Crypto markets never remain static for long. In the past two days, Cardano (ADA) has shown fresh technical resilience, sparking rumors of a spring rally. Meanwhile, a newer contender in the market has ramped up its own token sale, attracting traders with massive early gains and a tangible GameFi plan. Below is a comparison of both projects and the reasons why many traders with a focus on short-term momentum are tipping Yeti Ouro (YETIO) right now. Cardano Price Prediction: Set to Take Its Next Leg Up Cardano price is above $0.70 following a 14% gain over the past week and now prints a clean double-bottom on the daily chart. Analysts report a fresh Golden Cross on the four-hour chart with the price remaining above the 50-period SMA to turn that average to support. Bullish sentiment was further boosted following the probabilities of an Cardano spot ETF rising from 20% to 70% during the current week. Institutional appetite is visible. Wallet accumulation at these levels, with higher expectations of a sprint towards the $0.88–$1.00 range upon a breach of resistance at $0.75. Macro tailwinds assist too: a survey conducted by ZyCrypto today indicates a “surge in ETF optimism” that may channel fresh funds to ADA over the summer. Under the hood, Cardano just surpassed Ethereum in core developer activity , solidifying a long-term innovation advantage. Yeti Ouro: The Presale Heating Up As ADA continues to accumulate technical momentum, Yeti Ouro is racing past its own milestones. The launch of presale stage 4 at $0.041 per YETIO brought the total tokens sold to 232 million and funds raised to more than $3.8 million. Supply-side scarcity is front-loaded with just a 1 billion-token hard cap and a pre-programmed 5% burn in the contract. Early investors from Stage 1 are seeing a 242% ROI with the Stage 4 price at $0.041 and a steeper token price is confirmed for the final presale Stage 5. The project is also offering investors a 20% bonus on all token purchases with an additional 5% bonus on all purchases over $500. Third-party trackers reflect the same urgency surrounding the project, to which Stage 5 will get the issue price back up again. CryptoTotem has the same cut-off points and repeats that the public sale started in September of last year, providing the campaign with one of the longest continuous ramp-ups in the current cycle — evidence of persistent demand from the community. Aside from tokenomics, YETIO’s hook is utility. It deploys Yeti Go, a racing game with play-to-earn mechanics developed in Unreal Engine 5. Yeti Go drops players into a fast-paced, visually rich world designed for maximum impact. Developed alongside the legendary studio behind Call of Duty, Spider-Man, The Witcher, and Dead Space, the game blends cinematic visuals with razor-sharp gameplay. But it’s the audio—crafted by sound engineers who’ve worked with Grammy-nominated artists like Major Lazer, Vybz Kartel, and Kabaka Pyramid—that gives the game its heartbeat. Scroll down to meet the lead character and enter its world where every second is driven by power, precision, and pulse-pounding energy. Comparative View: ADA vs YETIO Factor Cardano (ADA) Yeti Ouro (YETIO) Market Cap / Stage Top-10 layer-1; $24 B Micro-cap presale; Catalyst (48 h) ETF probability spike to 70% & Golden Cross Stage 4 price jump + live demo; final hours of discount Upside Narrative 25–40% move to $1 during bull run Presale step-up from $0.041 → $0.066 (61%) before listing Risk Profile Lower volatility, slower ROI High volatility, asymmetric ROI potential Utility Hook Smart-contract platform, growing dApp base GameFi racing title with in-game token sinks The table speaks volumes: ADA has stability and a legitimate way to gain in increments, but its size prevents triple-digit gains in the near future. YETIO is at the other end of the spectrum — a new micro-cap story with product proof-points and a presale price that automatically ratchets higher in less than a day. For speculators that can handle high risk, risk-reward skew is in favour of YETIO today. Key Takeaway Cardano is fortifying its technical and fundamental foundation, and a confirmed breakout above $0.75 may take ADA price to the psychological $1 level. But in the very near-term, momentum capital is seemingly seeking higher returns elsewhere. Yeti Ouro’s terminal-phase presale merges live GameFi use cases with a tight supply cap and a countdown clock that puts both pressure on demand and enhances demand pressure. With the token to go live on exchanges in Q2, YETIO is the higher-beta trade of choice among investors seeking outsized gains before the broader bull cycle starts. It’s always about position size and conducting personal research, of course, but if the past two days are any indicator, YETIO is the one to watch.

Despite this fall, WLD remains up by nearly 10% in a week and by 46% in the past fortnight, with the altcoin benefitting in the past couple of days from Coinbase’s announcement that it has added the token to its listing roadmap. This upcoming listing could be the boost Worldcoin needs to resuscitate its fortunes over the long term, given that it is down by 76% in the past year and by 91% since reaching an ATH of $11.74 in March 2024. And with the Worldcoin project launching yesterday in the US, now may be a very good time to buy WLD . Worldcoin Price Prediction: How High Can WLD Go After Coinbase Announcement? Posting on X on Wednesday, Coinbase revealed that it had added the Optimism-based version of Worldcoin to its listing roadmap. Assets added to the roadmap today: Worldcoin (WLD) https://t.co/rRB9d3hSr2 — Coinbase Assets (@CoinbaseAssets) April 30, 2025 In a follow-up tweet , Coinbase added that the “launch of trading for these assets is contingent on market-making support, and sufficient technical infrastructure,” meaning that there’s no 100% guarantee that a Worldcoin will happen. Similarly, it has not specified a particular timeline for any WLD listing, so we may have to wait anything from a few weeks to a few months. This is perhaps why the announcement hasn’t prevented the Worldcoin price from declining today, with the token’s chart suggesting that it may fall a little further before recovering again. Most notably, its relative strength index (purple) has dropped from 80 at the end of April to around 60 today, and it looks like it will descend further. Source: TradingView On the other hand, WLD’s 30-day average (orange) has been well below the 200-day (blue) since January, implying that the coin is actually due a new bull phase in the medium-term. As such, we can see the Worldcoin price returning to $2 by the end of June, while a return to more bullish market conditions could even see it push towards $5 by the end of the year. Its ascent may find help in the fact that Worldcoin has officially launched in the US, with the project planning to make up to 10,000 of its iris-scanning orbs available in the American market in the next year. It had faced opposition in such countries as Spain and Portugal , amid data concerns. New Altcoins with Strong Market-Beating Potential Because Worldcoin may continue to face regulatory hurdles in various markets, some traders may already want to look at other alternatives, including newer tokens that can offer a little more volatility. One area to look at is with presales, which, in the right conditions, can result in a token rallying hard when it lists for the first time, given the momentum it had generated. And one presale coin generating lots of momentum right now is Bitcoin Bull (BTCBULL) , an ERC-20 token that has raised $5.2 million in its increasingly popular sale. SOON. pic.twitter.com/abViwoxnm6 — BTCBULL_TOKEN (@BTCBULL_TOKEN) April 30, 2025 With a hard cap of 21 billion tokens, Bitcoin Bull has tied its deflationary tokenomics to Bitcoin’s price, with the coin scheduling two different kinds of event whenever BTC reaches certain milestones. Firstly, BTCBULL will burn a percentage of its supply whenever BTC reaches a new $25,000 milestone, beginning with $125,000. Secondly, the coin will also stage Bitcoin (BTC) airdrops when BTC reaches a $50,000 milestone, starting from $150,000. This could make the token very profitable to hold, especially when holders can also stake it to receive passive income. The BTCBULL sale will end in the next few weeks, but investors can still join it by going to the Bitcoin Bull website and connecting a wallet such as Best Wallet . The token is currently available at $0.00249, although this price will rise again tomorrow, so traders should act sooner rather than later.

While expectations were that the regulator would approve XRP ETFs for trading at the start of May, the decision has been postponed once again. What this has done is increase expectations for these exchange-traded funds, with most of the market patiently waiting for when the green light will come. Why Investors Are Anticipating XRP ETFs There are numerous reasons for why investors are anticipating the XRP ETFs. Some of these include easier access to investing in the altcoin by institutions without them having to buy XRP directly, as well as increased demand as the cryptocurrency goes mainstream. All of this is expected to culminate in the rising value of the token and possibly be the catalyst that helps the XRP price break toward a new all-time high. Related Reading: Dogecoin Price Poised For Breakout Amid Accumulation, Here’s The Target Dan Tapiero, the founder of 10T Holdings, a US-based equity firm, has also come forward to explain why the XRP ETFs are being anticipated. In an interview with CoinDesk, the founder starts out by lauding XRP’s resilience so far, as it has managed to survive over the years. The altcoin has been through low market participation due to the SEC’s lawsuit spanning over four years, and has managed to come out and maintain its position as one of the most valuable cryptocurrencies. Speaking about the crypto firm itself, Ripple, Tapiero explains that it has managed to turn itself into a conglomerate of assets in the ecosystem. Given this, the private equity founder believes that “there’s value there”, and as such, there are investors who are anticipating the launch of the XRP ETFs. Another reason why these XRP ETFs are being anticipated is because “it’s made in America now.” This refers to the inclusion of XRP in Donald Trump’s strategic crypto reserve, alongside the likes of Bitcoin, Ethereum, Solana, and Cardano. Additionally, Ripple’s founder, Brad Garlinghouse, continues to work with President Donald Trump, feeding the narrative of XRP being “Made in America.” Pushing The XRP Price To New Highs The launch of the XRP ETFs is expected to be incredibly bullish for the XRP price, and the basis of this has been the reaction of BTC and ETH to the launch of the Spot Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs. Before the launch of the Spot Bitcoin ETFs, the BTC price was trading below $50,000. However, in the months following the approval, Bitcoin rose by more than 100% to reach new all-time highs above $100,000. Related Reading: Ethereum CrossX Indicators Flashes Buy As Insitution Accumulates, Analyst Says Brace For $4,000 If the XRP ETFs are approved this year and follow this pattern, then it is expected that the XRP price will cross $4 this year, beating its 2017 high of $3.8. The influx of institutional funds would make an impact, especially given Ripple’s mission to make XRP the digital asset of choice for institutions and banks.

44069471,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=154646,1746194446,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,UK Crypto Regulation: Navigating the Future with FCA’s Proposed Framework,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/uk-crypto-regulation-fca/,"Big news from across the pond! The United Kingdom is taking significant steps towards creating a clearer rulebook for the crypto world. If you’re involved in crypto, whether as an investor, developer, or business, this is something you’ll want to pay close attention to. The U.K. Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) has officially opened the floor for discussion, seeking feedback from the industry on a proposed UK crypto regulation framework. This isn’t just a small tweak; it’s a comprehensive proposal designed to bring more clarity and oversight to various cryptoasset activities. Understanding the FCA Crypto Framework So, what exactly is the FCA proposing? The core idea is to establish a robust regulatory perimeter that encompasses key areas of the cryptoasset market. The goal is to manage risks, protect consumers and market integrity, while still allowing for innovation to thrive. The proposed FCA crypto framework is looking at several specific activities and participants within the crypto ecosystem. This includes: Crypto Intermediaries: Businesses that facilitate crypto transactions, such as exchanges, brokers, and custodians. The framework aims to set standards for how these firms operate, handle customer assets, and manage risks. Staking: This increasingly popular activity involves locking up crypto assets to support a network’s operations and earn rewards. The proposals look at how staking services, particularly those offered by intermediaries, should be regulated. This is a key focus, especially for services offering crypto staking UK customers use. Lending: Crypto lending platforms, where users can earn interest on their crypto or borrow against their holdings, are also under scrutiny. The framework considers how to address the risks associated with these platforms, including transparency and collateralization. Decentralized Finance (DeFi): Perhaps the most complex area, DeFi regulation UK is a significant challenge. The FCA is exploring how to supervise activities within decentralized protocols, acknowledging the unique nature of these technologies while identifying potential points of intervention for risk management. If enacted, this legislation would formally place specific cryptoasset activities under the FCA’s supervision. This means firms conducting these activities would need to comply with FCA rules, potentially including requirements around capital, consumer protection, and anti-money laundering (AML). Why Are New UK Crypto Laws Being Proposed Now? The move towards clearer UK crypto laws isn’t happening in a vacuum. The crypto market has grown significantly, attracting both retail and institutional participants. With this growth comes increased potential for consumer harm, market manipulation, and financial crime if activities are left unregulated. Globally, regulators are grappling with how to effectively oversee cryptoassets. The UK’s approach aligns with a broader international trend towards bringing crypto activities within existing or new regulatory perimeters. By proposing this framework, the UK aims to provide certainty for businesses and investors, potentially fostering responsible innovation while mitigating risks. What Does This Mean for You? The implications of this proposed framework depend on how you interact with crypto: For Businesses: If you operate a crypto exchange, offer staking services, provide crypto lending, or build DeFi protocols that interact with UK users, you will likely face new compliance requirements. Now is the time to understand the proposals and prepare for potential changes. Engaging with the feedback process is crucial. For Investors & Users: While regulation might sound daunting, it often brings benefits like increased consumer protection and market integrity. Stricter rules for intermediaries could mean more secure platforms and clearer information about the risks involved in activities like crypto staking UK services provide or using crypto lending platforms. However, it could also potentially impact the availability or structure of certain services. How Can the Industry Provide Feedback? This is the critical next step. The FCA isn’t just announcing rules; they are asking for input. This feedback period is an opportunity for crypto businesses, developers, academics, legal experts, and interested individuals to voice their perspectives, highlight potential unintended consequences, and suggest alternative approaches. Providing constructive feedback is vital to shaping effective and balanced UK crypto regulation . It helps regulators understand the nuances of the technology and the market, potentially leading to rules that are both effective at managing risk and supportive of innovation. Potential Benefits and Challenges of the Proposed FCA Crypto Framework Every regulatory proposal comes with potential upsides and downsides. Let’s look at a few: Potential Benefits: Increased Consumer Protection: Clearer rules for intermediaries can help prevent fraud, scams, and operational failures that harm users. Market Integrity: Regulation can help reduce market manipulation and illicit activities, fostering a healthier trading environment. Regulatory Clarity: Providing a defined legal status for certain activities gives businesses confidence to operate and invest in the UK. Fostering Trust: A regulated environment might attract more traditional financial institutions and hesitant investors into the crypto space. Potential Challenges: Stifling Innovation: Overly strict or poorly designed rules could make it difficult for new crypto businesses and technologies, particularly in DeFi, to develop and operate in the UK. Complexity and Cost: Complying with new regulations requires resources, which could be particularly burdensome for smaller startups. Defining DeFi: Regulating decentralized protocols is inherently difficult and could lead to unintended consequences or jurisdictional challenges. Competitive Disadvantage: If the UK’s rules are significantly stricter than other jurisdictions, it could drive crypto businesses elsewhere. The feedback process is intended to help navigate these challenges and find the right balance. Examples of Areas Under Review To illustrate the scope, consider these examples: A UK-based crypto exchange offering trading and custody services would likely fall under direct FCA supervision, needing to meet specific capital and operational requirements. A platform providing a service that pools users’ Ether for staking on Ethereum 2.0 and distributes rewards ( crypto staking UK service) would need to clarify how it fits within the proposed lending or intermediary rules. A decentralized lending protocol might not have a central entity to regulate directly, posing questions about how risks associated with that protocol (e.g., smart contract risk, liquidation risk) can be addressed under DeFi regulation UK is considering. Actionable Insights for the Crypto Community What should you do now? Stay Informed: Follow updates from the FCA and crypto news outlets regarding the consultation process. Read the Proposals: If you are a business or developer, obtain and carefully review the FCA’s consultation paper. Prepare Your Feedback: Identify how the proposals would impact your operations or interests. Prepare a thoughtful and evidence-based response. Engage with Industry Groups: Many industry associations are coordinating responses to the FCA. Participating in these efforts can amplify your voice. Assess Your Operations: For businesses, begin assessing where potential compliance gaps might exist based on the proposed UK crypto laws . This is a critical moment for the future of crypto in the UK. The regulatory framework that emerges will significantly shape how the industry operates for years to come. Concluding Thoughts: Shaping the Future of UK Crypto The FCA’s move to solicit industry feedback on its proposed FCA crypto framework marks a pivotal point. It signals the UK’s commitment to creating a structured environment for cryptoassets, addressing everything from intermediaries and lending to crypto staking UK services and the complex realm of DeFi regulation UK is exploring. While the path forward involves navigating challenges related to innovation and implementation, the opportunity for the industry to contribute to shaping these crucial UK crypto laws is invaluable. By actively participating in the feedback process, stakeholders can help ensure that the final framework is effective, balanced, and supportive of a thriving, yet safe, crypto ecosystem in the United Kingdom.

Leaked agreements reveal that Rentech held more than 5% of MOVE’s total token supply, and the agreement terms seemed to trend towards pushing the price up to a $5 billion value before the planned sell-off. Coinbase resolved to delist the token after it initiated limited trading for MOVE. The exchange announced that the token failed to meet its listing requirements. The MOVE token has also suffered from the incident impacting the cryptocurrency market, with a 20% loss in the last 24 hours and a 50% loss in the last 30 days. The downward trend represents a long-term erosion of investor confidence as a result of the scandal. To limit the damage, the Movement Foundation announced that it had terminated its relationship with the implicated market maker. It also stated that it would initiate a USDT buyback for 38 million from a new reserve. However, the residual effects of the market maker scandal are evident in Manche’s suspension and Coinbase ‘s delisting. Independent investigation to assess the level of internal involvement Movement Labs has retained Groom Lake to conduct a review of Movement’s governance in relation to the market maker incidents. Their independent investigation is meant to ascertain whether Movement executives were directly involved in the alleged market manipulation scheme or if they were also misled by external parties. The results of this investigation will be crucial for the project’s future, as they will clarify the extent of any internal knowledge or participation in the token dump that occurred in December. The review comes at a critical time as the project faces both regulatory scrutiny and declining market confidence. The relationship between Movement Labs, the Movement Foundation, and Rentech remains under particular focus. The leaked contracts suggesting Rentech controlled a substantial portion of the token supply raise questions about due diligence and oversight within the project’s management structure. Rushi Manche’s suspension as co-founder appears to be a precautionary measure while the investigation proceeds, though the company has not specified whether he is suspected of direct involvement or oversight failures. The temporary removal of a founding team member signals the seriousness with which the organization is approaching the allegations.

Its social media platform integration and AI agent combo produce a powerful alliance to solve the simple challenges of investors and market stakeholders. Alexander Saveliev, founder and CEO of TripleA, shares , “The financial information landscape has become incredibly fragmented. Investors are forced to jump between dozens of apps, websites, and social platforms to gather the intelligence they need. TripleA solves this by bringing everything into a single, intelligent interface.” Beyond News Aggregation: AI as the Core of Decision-Making TripleA aspires for global excellence beyond mere news aggregation while adhering to a vision beyond basic content curation. TripleA’s core operational function establishes itself as an “AI agent for news and investments” by converting raw data through AI methods into valuable intelligence. “We’re not just filtering news—we’re helping users understand, decide, and act,” Saveliev explains. This philosophy demonstrates itself in four main AI functions. Comprehensive AI Analytics TripleA uses its AI engine to process current news, assets, and market data in real time to generate insights that manual research methods require multiple hours to achieve. The AI processing system displays news information by integrating market-wide trends and conducts asset-class impact analysis to identify opportunities during significant industry events. Strategy Simulation and Optimization The most outstanding feature of TripleA is the ability to generate optimized trading strategies by processing historical and current market data. The platform facilitates backtests by applying historical market information before presenting AI-assisted recommendations about portfolio optimizations. Focused primarily on institutions with quantitative research divisions, the capability now streams easily to private users. Intelligent Automation TripleA ensures productivity by turning passive consumption into active investment strategies. Users can deploy automated bots to execute preset strategies, receive personalized market alerts, and gain signals that simultaneously identify potential entry and exit points across multiple markets. Sentiment Analysis and Forecasting The platform’s AI evaluates news material and market-driven emotional elements to predict investor sentiment. Users can detect upcoming market shifts by analyzing combined emotional feedback from social media users, news consumers, and community forum participants. The Investment Magnet: Scaling to Millions of Paying Users Investors find TripleA attractive because of its potential for extensive market growth. Market analysis reveals that the platform’s potential user base ranges between 43 to 86 million within its six primary asset classes, including crypto, stocks, VC, gambling, influence markets, and MLM. Attracting 2% paying subscribers results in an 860,000-1.7 million subscriber base matching existing financial information services. B2C Subscription Model Users subscribe to premium features by selecting from various payment plans that generate recurrent revenue while the company expands its user base. B2B Enterprise Solutions Enterprise clients, including financial institutions and investment firms, use TripleA APIs with data infrastructure to improve their information-gathering power and develop profitable business partnerships. Affiliate and Partner Ecosystem Through its developed affiliate system, TripleA enables content creators, financial influencers, and partners to generate revenue streams as the platform grows through expanded customer acquisition patterns. Daily Usefulness: How TripleA Transforms User Experience Any adequate financial platform must develop into a tool that people require daily. The system provides specialized user experiences, catering to those using it as professionals and casuals. Personalized News Aggregation TripleA forms its core with a wide-ranging news aggregator that merges content from more than 90 sources comprising web publications, including Cointelegraph, CryptoSlate, and Benzinga. It also considers social media, including Reddit, X, and Telegram. TripleA’s AI transforms user-specific preferences and behavior patterns to improve information flow. Customizable Dashboard and Widgets Users can customize their TripleA dashboard to feature widgets for portfolio tracking, market rankings, price alerts, and technical analysis. It allows anyone to access critical information within seconds. AI Investment Assistant The revolutionary AI Investment Assistant within TripleA functions as an interactive financial advisor. The system allows users to express queries while requesting information about particular assets. It provides focused suggestions that consider personal risk outlooks and investment targets. Cross-Market Insights Multiple market data integration between crypto, stocks, VC, gambling, influence, and MLM on the TripleA platform produces exclusive cross-sector results, moving beyond the capabilities of standalone market platforms. The platform’s holistic approach allows users to detect connections between markets while recognizing developing trends, leading them to opportunities before competitors. The Road Ahead: TripleA’s Ambitious Development Timeline TripleA has set obtainable KPI targets of 4.5 million summer 2025 registrations while deploying an ordered development plan that maintains high-velocity growth with product durability. The platform will initiate its release sequence by deploying basic features that establish the news aggregator, dashboard, and AI assistant abilities. Three progressive building stages that offer increasingly advanced capabilities will follow: Stage 1: Foundation Building The first batch of features provides users access to specific data connections, smart search functionality, portfolio enhancement devices, alert tools, and AI news processing capabilities. Stage 2: Advanced Intelligence The platform’s second development phase incorporates sentiment analysis, industry summarization, bonuses aggregator, automated bots and strategy simulation, and optimization capabilities. Stage 3: Ecosystem Expansion The last phase of development creates a community and ecosystem that includes achievements and gamification, social functions, API for developers, and an education portal alongside an events calendar and trading platform integration. A New Paradigm for Financial Information TripleA’s innovative approach signifies an industry-shifting method of how investors consume and utilize financial information. TripleA reveals how financial intelligence can define the trading world through sophisticated AI agents that deliver insights across platforms. “Traditional financial terminals and news services were designed for a different era,” explains Saveliev. “TripleA is built for today’s investors who move fluidly between crypto, stocks, and emerging markets, who need intelligence on their mobile devices, and who expect information to be not just delivered but interpreted.” TripleA is en route to redefine market intelligence with its ambitious goals, third-gen AI abilities, and strategic integration with platforms that reach billions of users.

Major players among the South Korean crypto exchanges – Bithumb, Coinone, and Korbit – have jointly announced plans to delist the WEMIX token , a move that has understandably caused concern among holders and investors. What’s Behind the WEMIX Delisting? This significant decision by some of the largest exchanges in South Korea stems from concerns raised by the Digital Asset eXchange Alliance (DAXA), a self-regulatory body formed by the country’s top crypto exchanges. While the exact reasons for the delisting are often multifaceted, they commonly involve issues related to transparency, disclosure, or concerns about the token’s circulating supply and distribution. For the WEMIX delisting specifically, reports suggest the decision is linked to discrepancies found in the actual circulating supply of WEMIX compared to the information provided by the WEMIX team. Accurate disclosure regarding tokenomics and supply is crucial for maintaining market transparency and investor trust. When exchanges find discrepancies, it can trigger investigations and potentially lead to protective measures like delisting. The Impact on the WEMIX Token and Holders A delisting from major platforms like Bithumb Coinone Korbit can have a profound impact on a cryptocurrency. Here are some key challenges: Reduced Liquidity: Trading volume often concentrates on major exchanges. Delisting significantly reduces the platforms where users can buy or sell WEMIX, decreasing liquidity. Price Volatility: The news itself often triggers panic selling, leading to a sharp decline in price. Reduced liquidity post-delisting can exacerbate price swings. Investor Confidence: Delisting is perceived as a negative signal, eroding confidence in the project’s stability and management. Accessibility: Holders on these specific exchanges will need to withdraw their tokens to other wallets or exchanges that still support WEMIX, which can be inconvenient. For holders of the WEMIX token , this situation presents a clear challenge. Understanding the implications and preparing for potential actions is crucial. Kim Seok-hwan Steps Up: The Anticipated Response In response to this critical development, the team behind WEMIX is not remaining silent. A note circulating within the crypto community indicates that an official response is being prepared. All eyes are now on Kim Seok-hwan , the CEO of WEMIX PTE, who is expected to issue a statement. The anticipated timing for this crucial statement is between 12:00 and 13:00 UTC on May 2. This response is highly anticipated as it will likely address the reasons cited for the delisting and outline the team’s position and potential next steps. What actions could WEMIX PTE take? Providing detailed clarification on the circulating supply issues. Presenting a plan to rectify any identified discrepancies or improve transparency. Potentially appealing the delisting decision or seeking dialogue with the exchanges/DAXA. Outlining strategies for maintaining token liquidity and accessibility on other platforms. The statement from Kim Seok-hwan is a critical opportunity for WEMIX to address concerns and attempt to mitigate the negative impact of the delisting. Why Bithumb, Coinone, and Korbit Matter The decision by Bithumb Coinone Korbit carries significant weight because these are among the largest and most influential cryptocurrency exchanges operating in the South Korean market. Along with Upbit and Gopax, they form the core of the South Korean crypto trading landscape and are part of the DAXA alliance which aims to protect investors and ensure a sound digital asset market. Their joint action on the WEMIX delisting highlights the increasing self-regulatory power of these exchanges and the importance of projects adhering to their standards, particularly concerning disclosure and market integrity. A delisting from one major exchange is challenging, but a coordinated delisting from multiple top platforms in a key market like South Korea is a severe blow. What’s Next? Actionable Insights for the Community Given the evolving situation, what can the WEMIX community and interested observers do? Monitor the Official Response: Pay close attention to the statement from Kim Seok-hwan on May 2. This will provide the most direct information on the team’s perspective and plans. Assess the Information: Evaluate the clarity and credibility of the response regarding the circulating supply issues and future transparency. Understand the Risks: Delisting increases the risk profile of the token. Be aware of potential price volatility and reduced trading options. Check Other Platforms: If you hold WEMIX on the affected exchanges, research which other reputable platforms list the token and understand the process for withdrawing and potentially transferring your assets. Stay Informed: Follow reputable crypto news sources for updates on the situation and any further actions by WEMIX or the exchanges. The coming days are crucial for WEMIX as it navigates this significant challenge posed by the South Korean crypto exchanges . Conclusion: Awaiting Clarity in the WEMIX Delisting Saga The announcement of the WEMIX delisting by major South Korean crypto exchanges like Bithumb Coinone Korbit is a serious development that underscores the challenges projects face in meeting exchange and regulatory standards, particularly concerning transparency about the WEMIX token supply. The focus now shifts to WEMIX PTE CEO Kim Seok-hwan and his impending statement. The community waits with anticipation to understand the team’s explanation and strategy to address the issues and mitigate the impact of this delisting crisis. The outcome of this situation will be closely watched as it holds implications not just for WEMIX but for other projects operating within the strict South Korean regulatory environment.

Revised GENIUS Act Introduced In Senate According to a press release for Senate Majority Leader John Thune (R-SD), the new legislation will proceed to the Senate during the chamber’s current working period. Formally known as the Guiding and Establishing National Innovation for U.S. , the legislation would define stablecoins at large, provide anti-money-laundering compliance provisions, and ensure consumer protections are in place for investors. NEW: An updated version of the Senate’s GENIUS Act — outlining a regulatory framework for payment stablecoins — was just introduced on the Senate floor. Bill is from @SenatorHagerty , @SenatorTimScott and @SenLummis . It comes after @LeaderJohnThune told GOP senators earlier this… — Eleanor Terrett (@EleanorTerrett) May 1, 2025 Senators Cynthia Lummis (R-WY), Tim Scott (R-SC), and Bill Hagerty (R-TN) also co-sponsored the GENIUS Act. Senator Elizabeth Claims Corruption In Trump’s Crypto Venture The updated legislation’s launch comes the same day as reports emerged that the Trump-affiliated World Liberty Financial’s new stablecoin, USD1, would be used to close Abu Dhabi-based investment firm MGX’s $2 billion deal with crypto exchange Binance. News of the controversial deal and reintroduced GENIUS Act sparked pushback from U.S. lawmakers like Senator Elizabeth Warren (D-MA), who slammed the political developments as corrupt. “A shady fund backed by a foreign government just announced it will make a $2 billion deal using Donald Trump’s stablecoins,” Warren said in a May 1 statement . “Meanwhile, the Senate is gearing up to pass the “GENIUS” Act — stablecoin legislation that will make it easier for the President and his family to line their own pockets. This is corruption, and no senator should support it,” she added. The spotlight has seemingly landed on Trump’s crypto ventures in recent months, particularly after the launch of his namesake memecoin $TRUMP. Just last month, $TRUMP unveiled plans to host an exclusive gala dinner at Trump National Golf Club in Washington, D.C. for the cryptocurrency’s top 220 holders. Critics argue that $TRUMP and World Liberty Financial’s USD1 could allow foreign governments to buy favor with the current sitting U.S. president. However, with Trump in power, it’s unclear just how much his detractors can do to stop it.

Wainwright,https://crypto.news/strategys-btc-gains-prompt-bullish-521-price-target-from-h-c-wainwright/,"MicroStrategy sharply increased its capital-raising target and 2025 bitcoin acquisition goals in its earnings report, prompting a bullish revision from analysts at H.C. Wainwright. In a research note dated May 2, analyst Mike Colonnese turned incremenetally bullish on Strategy’s stock with a price target lifted from $480 to $521, citing increased BTC holdings forecasts and strong execution on capital raising. As part its first quarter earnings report on Thursday, Strategy doubled its capital plan to $84 billion through 2027, up from the $42 billion goal announced in late 2024. The new “42/42” plan includes $42 billion in equity and $42 billion in fixed-income issuance, including convertibles and preferreds. The firm has already raised $10 billion this year and acquired 106,085 Bitcoin ( BTC ) to date. Strategy’s bitcoin yield through April was 13.7%, representing 91% of its original annual target, with a $5.8 billion gain already booked, or 58% of the initial goal.

An additional 25,370 BTC was bought in April. The firm’s BTC yield for Q1 stood at 11%, with a $4.1 billion gain based on quarter-end prices. Colonnese now expects Strategy to end 2025 with 691,249 BTC, up from a prior estimate of 601,029. His BTC gain forecast rises to $12 billion, with a year-end price assumption of $150,000 per coin. While still below the company’s revised guidance of $15 billion in gains and a 25% BTC yield, Colonnese sees Strategy’s capital access and performance as strong indicators of growth. Despite cutting projected revenues for 2025 and 2026 to $461.2 million and $475.7 million respectively, down from previous estimates of $473 million and $485.1 million, Colonnese emphasized the company’s ability to maintain a premium valuation. The $521 price target is based on a 2x premium to the firm’s projected 2025 net asset value of $103.7 billion.

Ripple Labs’ completed its scheduled monthly rebalancing on May 1, moving 1 billion XRP and relocking a significant portion of the tokens back into escrow. The digital assets company, per its usual pattern, was scheduled to unleash 1 billion tokens worth approximately $2.2 billion from two wallets, Ripple (26) and Ripple (27) . In a reassuring sign for investors, no new XRP will be released into circulation for May 2025 (if things stay as they are), helping to limit selling pressure. As part of its standard rebalancing, Ripple distributed the 1 billion XRP across six addresses, according to the data Finbold retrieved from XRPScan on May 2, the Ripple (26) contained two escrows set to unlock with 200 million and 300 million XRP, while Ripple address (27) had one batch of 500 million tokens. The two primary wallets for May – Ripple (26) and Ripple (27) – sent out 300 million tokens to Ripple (1) and locked into escrow another 700 million across Ripple (12), Ripple (14), and Ripple (15). May moves of Ripple (26) and Ripple (27). Source: XRPScan The latest unlock came during increased volatility and a relatively downward direction of XRP. Despite this, the first day of May went without a significant price move. Though there was a moderate dip on May 2, XRP swiftly recovered and is, at press time, changing hands at $2.22, following confirmation of the re-locking, likely reducing fears of excess supply entering the market. XRP one-week price chart. Source: Finbold XRP underperforms the market despite recent rally XRP slightly underperformed the broader market in April and at the start of May. Its trajectory has generally followed the moves of many other major cryptocurrencies and the leadership of Bitcoin ( BTC ). The token enjoyed a significant recovery from the April 7 lows near $1.75, but the subsequent rise has not been particularly decisive. For example, BTC is up nearly 13% in the last 30 days, and XRP a mere 4.25%.

Market Pundit On Why Macro Channel Breakout Could Blow Up XRP Price,https://zycrypto.com/ripples-xrp-at-17-price-market-pundit-on-why-macro-channel-breakout-could-blow-up-xrp-price/,"XRP traded relatively muted this week, even as the crypto market grapples with macroeconomic pressures such as the escalating trade tensions between China and the United States. This calm has been further worsened by Tuesday’s news that the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has postponed its decision on Franklin Templeton’s XRP spot ETF application until June 17. However, Bloomberg ETF analyst James Seyffart noted that these delays could extend, with final decisions on several crypto-related exchange-traded products (ETPs) likely to arrive in Q4. “I am expecting more delays today or at least this week…This is expected IMO. Final deadlines for most of this stuff is in October 2025 or later,” Seyffart noted, emphasizing that the timeline could shift depending on how swiftly the SEC engages with applicants. Despite these setbacks, analysts like EGRAG CRYPTO believe that XRP may be setting up for a significant long-term rally based on technical factors. On Wednesday, he shared a monthly chart showing XRP’s movement within a “Macro Channel,” projecting a potential rise to between $17 and $55 based on historical candlestick patterns. With XRP trading around $2.18, he highlighted the current phase as “Candle number 5,” which he suggests could echo XRP’s explosive 1,700% surge in 2018. “XRP – MACRO Channel ($17-$55): We’re currently in Candle number 5… The measured move points to a potential high of $55. As for me, I have my eyes set on $27, but I plan to sell gradually as prices rise,” he stated. Earlier this week, the pundit speculated that XRP may be mirroring its 2017 fractal, potentially targeting $120 in the longer term. Meanwhile, TradingView analyst Ande Wave identified a bullish inverted head and shoulders pattern in the short term, noting that “XRP is breaking through descending resistance,” with the breakout bar currently testing a key liquidity zone. He added that a smooth approach to the $2.186 level could significantly increase the chances of a sustained breakout and further upside. Echoing this view, analyst Ali Martinez noted on Monday that “ XRP looks to be breaking out of an inverse head and shoulders pattern, with a potential upside target between $2.70 and $2.90.” Such a move would represent a 30% surge, positioning XRP above the critical $2.85 support/resistance zone. At press time, XRP was trading at $2.23, reflecting a 0.59% drop in the past 24 hours.",Cryptocurrency|News|Ripple|XRP News,EN,0,0,ASIA|MARKET|REGULATION|TRADING|XRP,"{'name': 'ZyCrypto', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/zycrypto.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",zycrypto,2025-05-02 15:13:08

Here Are the Details,https://en.bitcoinsistemi.com/bitcoin-exchange-kraken-releases-first-quarter-2025-earnings-report-here-are-the-details/,"Crypto exchange Kraken has released strong first-quarter results for 2025, reporting revenue of $472 million, up 19% year over year, as trading activity picked up despite broader market softness. Kraken Reports $472 Million in Q1 Revenue, Fueled by Trading Surge and NinjaTrader Acquisition The company also reported adjusted profit of $187 million, up 1% from the previous quarter and 17% from the first quarter of 2024. Trading volumes on the platform increased by 29% year over year, while funded accounts grew by 26%, indicating increased user engagement. However, assets held on the platform fell by 2% to $34.9 billion, which Kraken attributed to lower asset valuations during the quarter. The highlight of the quarter was Kraken’s acquisition of retail-focused futures and derivatives trading platform NinjaTrader. Described by Kraken as “the largest-ever combination of traditional finance (TradFi) and crypto,” the deal marks a significant step in the company’s strategy to become a multi-asset trading platform. “This transaction marks the largest deal ever combining traditional finance (TradFi) and crypto,” Kraken said in its earnings report. “More than expanding our business, this strategic acquisition strengthens our position in both TradFi services and derivatives for crypto.” This acquisition gives crypto investors access to traditional futures markets while NinjaTrader clients gain direct exposure to digital assets, bridging the gap between traditional and decentralized financial markets. In parallel, Kraken has continued to expand its services with the launch of Kraken Pay, a cross-border payments feature that aims to enhance global crypto transactions. The exchange is also preparing to launch crypto debit cards in partnership with Mastercard, further integrating its offerings into everyday financial use cases. To strengthen transparency, Kraken completed a Proof of Reserve (PoR) validation as of March 31. The firm allows users to independently verify their on-chain holdings via Merkle tree proofs and plans to publish these audits quarterly as part of its long-term commitment to verifiable custody. With strategic acquisitions, new features, and a growing user base, Kraken’s Q1 performance reinforces its ambitions to compete at the intersection of crypto and traditional finance. *This is not investment advice.

Initial reports suggested Ripple offered between $4 billion and $5 billion, but the offer was rejected by Circle. Now, new sources claim Ripple has increased the bid to $20 billion — though no official confirmation has been made. Pro-XRP lawyer John Deaton weighed in on the situation. He said that Circle filed its S-1 registration with the SEC on April 1, 2025, planning to go public on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) under the ticker “CRCL.” JPMorgan Chase and Citigroup are listed as the lead underwriters, with the IPO expected to launch this summer.

However, this is still significantly lower than the $9 billion valuation Circle had aimed for during a failed SPAC merger back in 2022. Deaton suggests Circle rejected the $5B offer because it expects its post-IPO value to be higher, possibly close to or above that $9B mark. He also highlighted the regulatory shift in favor of crypto, with pro-crypto policies and the possible passing of the STABLE GENIUS Act, as signs that a $10B+ deal wouldn’t be unrealistic. Adding another layer of speculation, Deaton questioned Ripple’s relationship with Coinbase, which already owns a minority stake in Circle. This raises the possibility of a bidding war between major crypto players.

The coin has several catalysts that may push it higher in the next few weeks. Nansen data shows that it is one of the most active chains in the crypto industry, recording over 31 million transactions in the last seven days. This figure surpasses other popular chains like Ethereum ( ETH ), Arbitrum ( ARB ), and Polygon. BNB Chain’s active addresses rose by 13% in the last seven days to 5.2 million. In contrast, Ethereum had 2 million active addresses in the same period. The chain generated over $3 million in revenue. The BNB price may also benefit from its staking statistics.

This follows a string of aggressive steps targeting Harvard, the country’s richest university, and others like it. Trump has accused the schools of encouraging antisemitism and discrimination on campus. His administration is using the full weight of federal tools—from financial threats to visa crackdowns—to pressure these institutions into making structural changes that give Washington more control. Trump goes after Harvard with IRS and Homeland Security Trump said on April 15 that Harvard’s tax-exempt status depended on acting in the public interest. In a Truth Social post, he wrote, “Remember, Tax Exempt Status is totally contingent on acting in the PUBLIC INTEREST!” Two weeks later, he declared that the exemption was getting revoked. The Treasury Department has already asked the Internal Revenue Service to investigate Harvard’s nonprofit status. The action could hit other universities too. Most public and private colleges depend on that same exemption to run their operations tax-free. Harvard responded publicly on Friday through a spokesperson, who told NBC News, “There is no legal basis to rescind Harvard’s tax-exempt status.” The spokesperson also warned, “Such an unprecedented action would endanger our ability to carry out our educational mission. The unlawful use of this instrument more broadly would have grave consequences for the future of higher education in America.” The administration’s crackdown also includes targeting international students. The Department of Homeland Security and immigration authorities have already revoked visas from thousands of students. In some situations, they even detained students individually. Now, Harvard’s entire ability to sponsor student visas could be stripped too. Trump’s Homeland Security Secretary confirmed that the agency is weighing that option. If enforced, the school could lose one of its most powerful recruitment tools for global talent. Meanwhile, on Capitol Hill, Democratic senators are trying to push back. On Friday, Chuck Schumer, Ron Wyden, Ed Markey, and Elizabeth Warren sent a letter to the acting chief of the Treasury Inspector General for Tax Administration. The letter demanded an investigation into whether the White House pressured the IRS to punish Harvard politically. “It is both illegal and unconstitutional for the IRS to take direction from the President to target schools, hospitals, churches, or any other tax-exempt entities as retribution for using their free speech rights,” they wrote. They also warned about what happens next. If the IRS bends to Trump’s demands now, the door opens to target smaller, less protected groups. “While auditing Harvard for refusing to capitulate to the President’s demands is clearly troubling, we are even more concerned about the implications for organizations that are too small to resist pressure from the White House or do not have the resources for legal action,” the senators added. Their warning included other nonprofits: “Church groups, hospitals, health clinics, or food banks could be next.” Cryptopolitan Academy: Coming Soon - A New Way to Earn Passive Income with DeFi in 2025.

Ripple co-founder to meet SEC chair,https://finbold.com/is-ripple-v-sec-case-about-to-end-ripple-co-founder-to-meet-sec-chair/,"Summary ⚈ Ripple co-founder Chris Larsen is meeting SEC commissioner Paul Atkins amid ETF delays. ⚈ Legal expert estimates Ripple v. SEC case may not conclude before October 2025. ⚈ XRP trades at $2.24 with whale activity hinting at possible bullish sentiment. The Ripple v. SEC case could soon see a major development in any hopes for its conclusion. Chris Larsen, the Co-founder and Executive Chairman of Ripple, is expected to meet Securities and Exchange (SEC) commissioner Paul Atkins today, according to a May 2 X post from pseudonymous crypto analyst Brett Crypto . The timing of the meeting has led to speculation as to what is on the agenda — particularly in view of the Commission’s recent delay in delivering a decision regarding Franklin Templeton’s long-awaited XRP spot exchange-traded fund ( ETF ). If the news broken by the analyst is credible, the meeting could represent a major milestone in the longstanding Ripple v. SEC case. With that being said, it remains quite unlikely that the legal battle will see a definitive conclusion in the near term. Here’s why the Ripple v. SEC case will most likely last a while longer While many in the cryptocurrency space hailed the appointment of Paul Atkins as a key catalyst that could lead to a speedy resolution, this is ultimately a legal matter — and in legal matters, minutiae matter. To put it in a slightly less wordy way, a procedural outline from James Farrell, a crypto lawyer who was previously employed at the Commission, put the earliest possible date for the end of the Ripple v. SEC case at October 2025 — with the worst-case scenario envisioning an end to legal battle in January of 2027. Farrell’s outline highlighted every single step that has to be taken for the matter to be resolved, as well as the time usually associated with the processes in question. The legal expert also posited that the delay in ending the Ripple v. SEC case is more a matter of the Commission not being ready to draft new legislation just yet. At present, XRP is trading at $2.24, having rejected a test of support at $2.20 earlier today. While the token has seen a 0.14% decrease in price over the past 24 hours, an increase in XRP whale accumulation could hint at a bullish undercurrent below what appears to be a neutral-to-bearish surface.

A 6% daily close signals a potential reversal after a sluggish week that saw red in five of the past six sessions. As the US-China trade war begins to hit consumers and U.S. GDP contracts for the first time since Q1 2022, market momentum has broadly stalled as traders moved to offload positions. But with this renewed strength, Cardano could have a case for the “best crypto to buy” conversation—moving past the market shakeout. Upcoming Catalysts Bolster the ADA Price Outlook With the Federal Reserve meeting set for May 6–7, anticipation is building that signs of economic contraction could prompt interest rate cuts later this year. While traders currently see little chance of a cut next week—93.2% expect no change, according to CME Group data —expectations for easing are growing for June. Such a policy shift could spark short-term growth and renewed market enthusiasm, adding fuel to bullish Cardano price forecasts. More so, Polymarket bettors are at their most confident yet, with odds hitting an all-time high of 71% in favor of a Cardano ETF approval in 2025. This untapped institutional demand could fuel Cardano’s price action, opening the door to broader exposure through traditional investment channels. Cardano Price Analysis: Is $100 ADA Close? While a $1000 Cardano is an unrealistic near-term target as economic concerns continue to weigh on risk-on sentiment, there is merit to the argument that ADA could see a surge. In the near term, the Cardano price faces a key barrier at the $0.70 resistance to advance a breakout of a 5-month symmetrical triangle pattern. ADA / USDT 3-day chart, symmetrical triangle pattern. Source: TradingView / Binance. A clean move above this level would bring the $0.75 resistance into focus—a likely retest point aligning with the upper bound of the channel. If the Cardano price can decisively clear this range, the rally that began in April could mark a wider trend reversal, extending another 100% toward $1.40. A credible scenario as momentum indicators continue to lean bullish. The MACD continues to widen its lead above the signal line, suggesting a long-term uptrend is taking shape. However, the RSI remains below the neutral 50 mark after a recent rejection—showing that while bullish momentum is building, sellers still haven’t been fully overpowered. A rejection from this point could see the Cardano price retrace 25% back to lower support at $0.53. Still, if momentum holds and the breakout confirms, the path toward a $100 ADA—though distant—could start to take shape sooner than many expect. This New ICO Could Push a Rival Chain Ahead Those who turned to Cardano as a Layer-1 alternative to Solana may want to reconsider – Solaxy ($SOLX) has just addressed Solana’s biggest weakness: scalability. As any user would know, failed transactions are the platform’s biggest gripe. But that narrative could shift with the arrival of Solaxy , Solana’s first-ever Layer-2 scaling solution. By processing transactions off-chain and finalizing them on Solana, Solaxy significantly reduces congestion and lowers transaction costs, while offering seamless interoperability across both blockchains.

According to crypto analyst Rekt Capital, increased dominance isn’t just a technical milestone but a precursor to a broader trend that could see the number one cryptocurrency command as much as 71% of the digital asset market. A Reclaim with Historical Weight Bitcoin Dominance isn’t just a percentage; it’s a pulse check on investor sentiment. When it rises, capital flows into BTC at the expense of altcoins, often indicating a “risk-off” approach or a bet on the flagship cryptocurrency as the market’s safe haven. Rekt Capital’s analysis suggested that reclaiming 64% as support could mirror historical patterns where dominance climbed above 70%, a level last seen during Bitcoin’s 2021 bull run. “The road to 71% continues on successful retest of 64%,” the crypto investor stated. Previously, in March and April, he outlined how BTC Dominance initially faced stiff resistance near its November 2024 highs before managing a breakthrough in late April. The successful retest of those levels into early May now marks the “final leg” of Bitcoin’s primacy, which, in the past, was followed by a sharp decline. “Bitcoin Dominance is now in the process of positioning itself for what will most likely be its final leg in its Macro Uptrend before a major collapse,” stated the analyst. Altcoin Season Incoming? The expected reversal often triggers what the crypto community calls an “altcoin season.” During such periods, the rest of the digital asset market tends to outperform BTC, drawing significant investor interest. At the time of writing, the king cryptocurrency’s share of the market stood at 63.8%, a heartbeat away from 64%. And if Rekt Capital’s prediction holds, then we could see a move to 71% within weeks, potentially setting the stage for a market rotation. ‘It is the Final Countdown,” the analyst wrote. Bitcoin’s price has been on a sharp rebound since April when it dipped below $75,000. It is currently changing hands at $96,873, up a modest 0.6% in 24 hours and 3.2% over the past week, amid a wave of whale buying . But not everyone is holding. As reported earlier, miners have offloaded nearly $850 million worth of BTC as they try to deal with post-halving revenue pressures.

Having shown signs of weakness in the past week, it is now losing grip daily. Prior to the recent bullish move, which came after finding a threshold at $7.15 last month, Trump also went through a lot of reductions after launching into the centralised exchange market in January. The bullish move, which appeared stuck under $17 due to a rejection, is now suspended to where it is changing hands at $12.5. It unfortunately lost buzz and now looks weak on the daily chart. A clear drop below $12 could cause a major sell-off in the next few days. That could bring us back to the bottom level, where the price picked up last month. If the bulls defend well, we can anticipate a rebound after forming a double-bottom pattern. Otherwise, the sell-off may extend to a new low. Locating support nearby, with a strong bounce back, the crypto will likely resume bullish at full speed. That should bring more positive change in the trading levels until the trend completely shifts above $80. Leading the Solana-based meme coin chart with roughly $2.5 billion worth of market cap at the time of writing, Trump’s price is now weak on the daily chart after posting major profits in the past weeks. Technically, the bulls appeared exhausted and are now taking a break on the daily chart. TRUMP’s Key Level To Watch Source: Tradingview In the current drop , the immediate support levels to consider for a pullback are $10 and $8.8. The $7.15 support would be the last defence line for the bulls in case of more dips. A recovery from the current trading level could bring us back to the $16.4 resistance. A push above it should allow a bigger price movement to $20 and $24.6 in the future.

Notably, Bitcoin dominance surged to a new four-year high, reaching 64.94% today, May 2. This peak, the highest since January 2021, is a product of Bitcoin's recent strong performance. Bitcoin Dominance up 13% Since December 2024Specifically, since April 21, Bitcoin's price has climbed from $85,197 to a peak of $97,470 on May 1, maintaining levels above $97,000 at the time of writing. This price surge, along with relatively slower growth in altcoins, has boosted Bitcoin dominance. Nonetheless, this builds on an uptrend that has persisted since last December. The dominance rate has risen from 57.22% in December 2024, gaining over 13% in five consecutive months. However, this rise has now brought Bitcoin dominance into a historically significant resistance zone around the 65% mark. In the previous bull market of 2021, dominance at this level triggered a sharp reversal. Back then, Bitcoin dominance touched a near four-year high of 73.63% in early January 2021 but quickly fell, closing the month at 63.09%. Interestingly, February 2021 saw a short-lived rebound to 64.83%, but resistance held firm, and dominance eventually plummeted to 39.56% by September 2021. That drop, which lasted for over seven months, coincided with the explosive growth of altcoins, leading to the altcoin season .What the Recent Bitcoin Dominance Peak Means for Alt SeasonNow, Bitcoin dominance is again testing that barrier. The monthly Relative Strength Index (RSI) for dominance has reached an all-time high of 72.22, signaling overbought conditions. Historically, such levels have preceded pullbacks. Bitcoin Dominance 1M Chart Bitcoin Dominance 1M Chart If Bitcoin dominance fails to break this resistance, a correction could ensue. The first significant support lies at the 0.786 Fibonacci retracement level of 59.35%, followed by the next major support at 54.97%. If this level also falters, dominance could retreat toward the 48.81% region, aligning with the 0.382 Fibonacci level. A pullback of this magnitude would likely translate to the long-anticipated altcoin season, during which altcoins outperform Bitcoin .Analysts Expect Imminent Altcoin SeasonSeveral prominent analysts have discussed the potential turning point for altcoins. For instance, Michaël van de Poppe, the founder of MN Consultancy, has been vocal about the resilience and prospects of the altcoin market. On April 16, he noted that the altcoin season index had reached its lowest point in two years, coinciding with a sharp drop in the fear and greed index. He emphasized that market sentiment felt grim, which he viewed as a contrarian indicator that shows a potential turning point toward recovery.https://twitter.com/CryptoMichNL/status/1912565150718259266Three days ago, van de Poppe observed that the total market cap of altcoins was maintaining strength and had recently confirmed a successful retest. He suggested that this development laid the foundation for a move toward new all-time highs. Meanwhile, pseudonymous trader Ak47 recently highlighted how the approval of altcoin-based ETFs in 2025 could contribute to the altcoin season. For context, according to Bloomberg Intelligence estimates, Litecoin and Solana have a 90% likelihood of ETF approval, while XRP stands at 85%. https://twitter.com/HolaItsAk47/status/1917875883622432940Dogecoin and Hedera Hashgraph are forecasted at 80%, and Polkadot, Cardano, and Avalanche each carry a 75% chance. These projections have triggered expectations for a robust altcoin season if these ETF products eventually secure approval.Also, Crypto Tamil, another analyst, discussed the BTC.D chart today. He pointed out a bearish divergence on the daily Bitcoin dominance chart and argued that the metric is nearing its peak. He asserted that the conditions are favorable for a full-fledged altcoin season.",Market|Bitcoin Price Prediction|Latest Bitcoin (BTC) News Today,EN,0,0,ADA|ALTCOIN|BTC|MARKET|TRADING,"{'name': 'The Crypto Basic', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/thecryptobasic.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",thecryptobasic,2025-05-02 15:30:40

The O’Leary Ventures Chairman outlined his approach to crypto, which is grounded in traditional portfolio construction and a very deliberate plan to prepare for institutional capital he believes is about to flood into the industry. Crypto: A 19% Allocation O’Leary holds a 19% weighting in crypto and related equities. That includes direct exposure to crypto and shares in major crypto exchanges like Coinbase, Robinhood and WonderFi. “Volatility is good for an exchange,"" he said. “No matter what crypto is doing, up or down, the exchange is making money because it’s the infrastructure.” For yield, he favors USDC over bank deposits. “The yield on that this morning is 3.822%. That’s better than a savings account.” (O’Leary disclosed he is a shareholder in Circle.) Still, O’Leary follows a strict strategy: never more than 5% in one position and never more than 20% in any sector, including crypto. No to Bitcoin ETFs, No to MicroStrategy Despite being long BTC, O’Leary is not a fan of the ETF wrapper. “I never understood why anybody would buy bitcoin in an ETF and pay fees. That’s insane,” he said. “If I want vol on crypto, just buy bitcoin.” (Bitcoin ETFs were introduced in the U.S. in January 2024 and have attracted about $115 billion in investment so far.) He also opted out of Strategy, saying Michael Saylor is “a great strategist, no question. But why don’t I just own bitcoin outright?” Regulation is the Missing Piece Institutional adoption of crypto hinges on regulation and compliance, he said. Large funds can't buy in until their internal systems can account for digital assets the same way they do equities or bonds. “There are trillions of dollars waiting on the sidelines. But they can’t move until it’s regulated and the compliance infrastructure is there.” That’s why he’s optimistic about stablecoin legislation in the U.S., which he expects to pass soon. If that happens, he said, “you want to own the exchanges.” “The era of the crypto cowboy is over,” he said. “They’re all in jail or felons. What we need now is compliance.” Kevin O’Leary will be sharing more about his crypto strategy at Consensus 2025 in Toronto on May 15.

The project’s pre-launch phase officially began on April 1, introducing several changes to token pricing. During the pre-launch phase, the token price will increase every two days until the target is met or the tokens sell out. Husky Inu (HINU) Token Price Rises Husky Inu’s pre-launch phase began on April 1, with the token price at $0.00015000. Since then, the token has registered several price increases, thanks to the introduction of a dynamic pricing system. The latest price increase has taken the token price to $0.00017125. The next price jump will take the token price to $0.00017175. The project has raised $748,175 and is getting closer to the $750,000 milestone. Husky Inu aims to raise $1.2 million by the end of the pre-launch phase. The Pre-Launch Phase Husky Inu’s pre-launch phase is designed to empower the project’s community, ensuring they benefit from favorable pricing. The project announced the pre-launch phase in a blog post and revealed the official launch date of the HINU token. The project also issued an update on the highly anticipated Earn App, set to launch in May. The project also thanked its backers and community in a statement, stating, “Over the recent period, the Husky Inu project has experienced remarkable growth not only in numbers but in strength, vision, and community engagement. We are sincerely grateful for the overwhelming support, dedication, and enthusiasm shown by each and every member of our ecosystem. Your belief in the Husky Inu mission has been the driving force behind our momentum.” The Earn App is slated to release on May 14, 2025. How Does The Pre-Launch Phase Work? The starting price of the HINU token at the beginning of the pre-launch phase was $0.00015000. This price will increase every two days until all the HINU tokens sell out. The longer the presale lasts, the higher the token price rises. The pre-launch phase ends immediately once the HINU tokens sell out. The table below highlights the projected price if the presale continues uninterrupted. Day Token Price 0 $0.00015000 2 $0.00015043 4 $0.00015087 6 $0.00015130 8 $0.00015174 10 $0.00015217 ….

Speaking at TOKEN2049 in Dubai , McDermott detailed how the bank is ramping up its trading operations, exploring crypto lending, and pursuing tokenized products that meet real-world use cases.These developments mark a significant expansion beyond Goldman’s previous approach, which avoided direct handling of crypto despite early engagement through derivatives.Expansion of Trading and LendingSince launching its crypto trading desk in 2021, Goldman Sachs has offered cash-settled Bitcoin and Ethereum options, in addition to CME-listed futures contracts. However, the firm has not taken direct custody of the underlying crypto assets. McDermott confirmed that client demand has grown steadily, prompting a broader push into trading and crypto lending operations. As part of this expansion, the bank is now examining ways to deliver tokenized instruments.Institutional Scale Hinges on RegulationAs Goldman Sachs deepens its digital strategy, regulatory clarity remains a decisive factor. McDermott emphasized that scaling institutional activity requires defined rules, particularly for areas like stablecoins and tokenized securities. He noted that without clear regulation, broad participation from large entities remains limited. Under President Donald Trump’s administration, the U.S. has seen a shift toward policies viewed as more favorable to digital asset innovation. He highlighted that changes in regulatory policy have led to more openness toward innovation in the digital asset ecosystem.He also mentioned how Trump plans to make the U.S. the crypto capital, which would push the need for a broader marketplace. When designing projects in this space, the executive emphasizes creating utility for institutional use, especially as these technologies scale up, build liquidity, and lead to larger, more efficient marketplaces. When asked about where blockchain could have the most immediate impact in traditional finance, McDermott pointed to stablecoins.Goldman Investing in Bitcoin ETFsGoldman Sachs’ involvement in digital assets also extends to its equity holdings. February filings revealed that the bank held $1.558 billion worth of Bitcoin exchange-traded funds. Specifically, it holds BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust and Fidelity Wise Origin Bitcoin Fund. The bank reported holding over 24 million IBIT shares, marking an 88% increase from the prior quarter.Meanwhile, in March, Goldman Sachs made its first-ever mention of Bitcoin in its annual shareholder letter. This reference was viewed as a milestone for the firm, which had not previously acknowledged crypto in its formal investor communications. The inclusion followed growing relevance of digital assets across financial markets and signaled a further integration of crypto-related topics in traditional finance discourse.",Market,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|FIAT|MARKET|TRADING,"{'name': 'The Crypto Basic', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/thecryptobasic.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",thecryptobasic,2025-05-02 15:43:57

Gooden cited the need to modernize public infrastructure and support a growing segment of Americans engaging with digital assets. In a May 1 letter to Acting GSA Administrator Stephen Ehikian, Gooden urged the agency to begin evaluating the feasibility of the initiative, emphasizing that such a move would “signal to the public that the government is embracing innovation in a secure and responsible manner.” The proposal aligns with former President Donald Trump’s campaign focus on advancing U.S. leadership in cryptocurrency and blockchain technology. “Expanding accessibility to crypto ATMs within federal buildings aligns with President Trump’s vision of positioning the United States as a global leader in cryptocurrency,” Gooden wrote. Gooden’s proposal calls for robust identity verification, transparent fee structures, and adherence to anti-money laundering regulations. He also stressed the importance of collaboration between regulators, private sector technology providers, and compliance experts to ensure any implementation prioritizes consumer protection and trust.

Law enforcement agencies have flagged these kiosks as potential vectors for fraud, including scams targeting vulnerable users. Gooden’s letter does not ignore these concerns, instead urging the GSA to establish clear operational guidelines to mitigate such risks. By adding crypto ATMs into federal spaces, Gooden argues, the government can provide both practical financial access and public education on digital assets—particularly in underserved communities.

The company, which has links to the Asian country's ruling Hun family, runs a Telegram-based marketplace where users can purchase personal data, money laundering services and even electric shackles intended for use on human beings. “Huione Group has come under intense scrutiny this week, with the U.S. Treasury’s Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) identifying the Cambodia-based conglomerate as an entity [of] primary money laundering concern,"" Elliptic co-founder Tom Robinson told CoinDesk. In January, the company introduced its own stablecoin that, unlike third-party assets like Tether's USDT, cannot be frozen by external organizations. The stablecoin, USDH, was created to ""avoid transfer restrictions of traditional digital currencies.” Despite rolling out the stablecoin, Robinson said FinCEN's move to clamp down on Huione is a ""significant blow"" to the conglomerate. ""This should serve as a wake-up call for the broader financial ecosystem to strengthen the detection and disruption of cross-border laundering networks,"" he added. Huione also received $150,000 worth of crypto from North Korean hacker Lazarus Group, which stole around $3 billion worth of crypto between 2018 and 2024, according to a report from cybersecurity firm Recorded Future.

X Money: Merging Social Media, AI, and Payments X Money aims to turn the X platform into more than just a social network. With features combining messaging, Grok AI integration, and digital transactions, it’s shaping up to be a one-stop app for communication and finance. Expected to launch in mid-2025, the platform could position X as a serious competitor to leading fintech apps, offering users a seamless experience for both social and financial interactions. Crypto Integration on the Horizon Anthony Scaramucci, founder of SkyBridge Capital, recently emphasized that Musk is likely to embed cryptocurrency payments into X’s payment system . Given Musk’s longstanding interest in decentralized finance —demonstrated through initiatives at Tesla and SpaceX—this move isn’t surprising. By allowing crypto payments, X could appeal to a broader, tech-savvy audience already engaged with digital assets like Bitcoin and Dogecoin . The move aligns with Musk’s vision of diversifying payment options and fostering financial innovation. Navigating Regulatory Roadblocks However, introducing crypto transactions isn’t without challenges. Regulatory compliance will be a major hurdle, especially as global financial watchdogs keep a close eye on digital asset usage. To roll out a secure and legally sound crypto service, Musk’s team will have to navigate complex legal frameworks across multiple jurisdictions. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Elon Musk Slams WSJ Over “False” CEO Exit Rumors – Crypto Leaders Rally , A Super App for the West? Musk’s ambition to build a super app similar to China’s WeChat is bold—but it won’t be easy. The Western market is already saturated with dominant players in both fintech and social media, making it a tough space to disrupt. Still, the idea of integrating social networking, AI, and cryptocurrency into one platform is a compelling one. If Musk can overcome the regulatory and competitive challenges, X could redefine how users interact online—financially and socially. As the world watches, the big question remains: Can Elon Musk turn X into the West’s first true Super App? .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

Analysts Say Contraction in US GDP, Falling Inflation Raises Hopes for Fed Rate Cut The U.S. economy contracted for the first time in three years and the Fed’s preferred inflation gauge, Core Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE), was flat in the latest month. Core PCE fell to 2.6% on an annual basis from 3.0%, reinforcing the narrative that inflation is slowly easing toward the central bank’s 2% target. Bitcoin Leads the Recovery Following the data release, Bitcoin surged past $97,000, gaining more than 13% since “Independence Day,” a symbolic term referring to a renewed rally among crypto investors. In contrast, the S&P 500 has gained less than 1% over the past 30 days, highlighting the growing divergence between digital assets and traditional equity markets. “With inflation moving toward the Fed’s 2% target, expectations of multiple rate cuts are strengthening. This could lead to a new wave of liquidity injections and benefit alternative risk assets like crypto more than equities, which may struggle in a slowing economy,” BRN chief research analyst Valentin Fournier said in a May 2 market update. *This is not investment advice.

That combination of blockchain and artificial intelligence is exactly what’s needed to solve real-world problems and create opportunities for early investors as its presale gains real traction. About Ruvi AI Ruvi AI is that rare platform that bridges the gap between innovation and practical application. By combining blockchain technology with AI, it delivers value to industries and investors alike. Scalable solutions for fraud prevention, logistics management and more are just the beginning. A Presale Success Story Ruvi AI’s presale is generating a lot of discussions. Just a few days after its launch, the project has sold over 10 million tokens, raising more than $100,000. That kind of demand reflects a strong belief in Ruvi AI’s approach to merging blockchain with AI to address real-world challenges. And with the Phase 1 price of $0.01 set to increase by 50% in Phase 2, investors are racing to secure their tokens now. Industry experts are watching Ruvi AI closely. Analysts predict the token’s value will quickly reach $1 shortly after listing offering phenomenal returns for those who secure their RUVI tokens during these early stages. VIP Tier 3 Rewards: A Generous Return on Investment Ruvi AI’s VIP Tiers are designed to reward early adopters. For VIP Tier 3, that means accumulating 100,000 RUVI tokens to qualify, which is $1,000 at the actual price of $0,01 per token. With a 60% bonus, that investment increases to 160,000 RUVI tokens. When listed at $0.07 per token, that’s worth $11,200 already. When analysts’ predictions of a $1 valuation are met shortly after listing, that same investment will be worth $160,000. These rewards make Ruvi AI a standout opportunity. And one that’s attracting investors who want substantial returns on a project backed by groundbreaking innovation. Leaderboard Incentives: Recognizing Top Supporters Ruvi AI also incentivizes its most dedicated investors with Leaderboard rewards . The top 10 investors each receive 500,000 RUVI tokens, worth $35,000 at the listing price of $0.07 and $500,000 when the token reaches the $1 valuation. Those who position themselves in Top 50 can bag 250,000 tokens valued at $250,000 at the 1$ post listing valuation. Even those who end in the Top 1000 are rewarded with 20,000 tokens. Analysts Praise Ruvi AI’s Vision Industry leaders have highlighted Ruvi AI as a key player redefining blockchain’s utility. “Ruvi AI is not just another blockchain project,” said a leading market analyst. “Its focus on combining AI with blockchain to address practical challenges like fraud detection and logistics optimization makes it highly relevant and scalable. Analysts are confident that Ruvi AI’s value will grow exponentially.” That tangible progress is already being demonstrated with the launch of Ruvi AI’s beta product. Scalable solutions across industries signal massive potential and set Ruvi AI apart from purely speculative projects. Time to Get Involved While Solana’s resurgence and the potential approval of a Solana ETF have rekindled market interest, Ruvi AI offers more than just speculation. With its presale ongoing, token prices low, and expert confidence high, now is the time for savvy investors to join a platform poised to revolutionize blockchain innovation.

Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is pursuing its own journey by earning $7.3 million during its presale event as investors acquire over 430 million tokens while establishing themselves as 9,200 holders. The altcoins differentiate themselves by earning investor enthusiasm while Solana remains out of the limelight. Dogecoin’s meme-driven momentum and Mutuum Finance’s DeFi utility signal potent opportunities in 2025. These tokens will start their ascent due to a strong market demand which seeks high risk alongside structured investment opportunities. Dogecoin’s Bullish Sprint Dogecoin preserves an upward momentum that reclaims $0.1828 after reaching a low point of $0.1316 during the earlier part of this month. According to analyst Javon Marks the bullish candlesticks detected on Dogecoin’s 5-day chart indicate an impending price increase that might reach $0.6533 (representing a 279% surge). The technical analyst Marks forecasts Dogecoin to hit $1.25 by 2025 based on the outcome of previous upward breaks leading to 500% price surges. Yet, the $0.20 resistance looms large. The cryptocurrency requires relentless buying power coupled with market conditions that support its price growth. The continued rise of Bitcoin provides support to Dogecoin however its sentimental nature makes it sensitive to market fluctuations. Mutuum Finance’s Presale Surge The MUTM asset of Mutuum Finance speeds through the fourth stage in its 11-staged presale at a price of $0.025. The project has achieved $7.3 million in funding through 9,200 token holders who have purchased 430 million tokens that are rapidly selling out. Phase 5 is approaching with its planned price increase to $0.03 while current holders will benefit from a 20% value growth. The planned tokenomics design promises investors a 140% increase during the initial trade at $0.06. After MUTM’s public launch the $2.75 estimated value will present a maximum ROI return of 10,900% which surpasses Dogecoin’s anticipated profit margin. The systematic price trajectory of this token attracts specification-averse investors because it provides consistent enjoyment. The quick sell-out during the presale forces investors who purchased early to move swiftly. Security and Incentives The development team at Mutuum Finance is conducting their Certik smart contract audit and will display results on social media during the final stages of work. The enhancement of platform reliability occurs during this step while creating trust in MUTM. The released dashboard reveals details about the leading 50 token holders who will receive bonus rewards if they retain their positions hence nurturing platform loyalty. Mutuum Finance operates separately from Dogecoin since its overcollateralized lending along with a buy-back system creates stable demand. The integrated features transform MUTM into an element similar to DeFi anchors while running apart from Dogecoin’s price-based operations. Increased investment occurs at $0.025 because users recognize that phase 5 will decrease available profit potential. Sealing the Altcoin Advantage Dogecoin represents the leading alternative coin in addition to Mutuum Finance (MUTM) which offers specialized benefits to its users base. Dogecoin derives its estimated price value of $1.25 mainly from market trends yet Mutuum Finance sets its planned price of $2.75 through DeFi assessment techniques. The latter’s presale, now in phase 4, offers a fleeting chance at $0.025 before the 20% jump. Each of these altcoins outperform Solana in its present state by integrating both general market volatility with strategic value initiatives. The moment is now for investors to acquire these altcoins at market rates because their projected development indicates future major growth.

Within the traditional financial sector, there has been a growing interest in offering cryptocurrency services to clients. Goldman Sachs is joining the ranks of other banks like Morgan Stanley and Charles Schwab that intend to launch cryptocurrency trading services for their clients. Goldman Sachs talks expansion into digital asset trading and tokenization At the TOKEN2049 event, Mathew McDermott , the Global Head of Digital Assets at Goldman Sachs, explained Goldman Sachs’ plans to expand its digital asset trading offerings. He stated that the company was looking into exploring crypto lending and making substantial investments in tokenization. The firm intends to meet its increasing client demand for digital asset services with this move. It also intends to secure the required regulatory approvals to ease the progress of these initiatives. Tokenization, which is the process of converting real-world assets into digital tokens on a blockchain, is a central focus of Goldman Sachs’ strategy. The firm aims to enhance liquidity and streamline its asset management processes through tokenizing assets such as private equity, bonds, and other financial instruments. Goldman Sachs’ digital asset platform, GS DAP®, plays an important role in this tokenization expansion strategy as it is designed to digitize and manage users’ assets in real-time while providing interoperability with other platforms and networks. Goldman Sachs announced in November 2024 that it was developing its digital asset platform into an industry-owned distributed technology solution and collaborating with partners like Tradeweb to bring new commercial use cases to the platform. The platform supports various asset classes, including debt and cash solutions. The banking industry is merging with the crypto sector Several major banks plan to expand their operations to include cryptocurrency offerings in 2025 and 2026. The influx of interest in cryptocurrency services from these banks is due to the current favorable regulatory environment under the Trump administration. The current U.S. government has relaxed the previous restrictions on banks engaging in crypto activities. Morgan Stanley announced plans to introduce cryptocurrency trading on its E*Trade platform by 2026. The project is an attempt to provide retail investors with direct access to cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum. Morgan Stanley is currently exploring partnerships with established crypto firms to achieve this goal. In 2026, both Charles Schwab and State Street will be launching their crypto services. Charles Schwab is preparing to offer crypto trading services, while State Street plans to launch its crypto custody services. State Street’s entry is most notable as the company has $46T in assets under custody. The firm previously partnered with Taurus for custody technology. Citigroup is also preparing to enter the crypto custody arena. The company is currently exploring ways to offer secure storage solutions for digital assets.

Stablecoin adoption could drive the market to a $2 trillion valuation by 2030. $3 billion in stablecoin transaction volume in September 2024 shows Latin America’s crypto demand. On May 1, World Chain announced the integration of USDC, the stablecoin issued by Circle, and Circle’s Cross-Chain Transfer Protocol (CCTP). The update allows World Chain’s 25 million users to transfer USDC from other blockchains and convert it into native stablecoins supported on the network. Transactions will no longer require centralized exchanges or third-party bridges. The integration improves transaction speed and security for dollar-backed transfers. World Chain, the blockchain supporting Worldcoin, was co-founded by OpenAI’s Sam Altman. How Does Native USDC Improve Security for World Chain Users? According to a World Chain blog announcement, the integration of the USDC stablecoin combines the largest use case in crypto with the world’s most globally distributed network. World and @Circle are bringing native @USDC and Cross Chain Transfer Protocol (CCTP) V2 to the most distributed network of humans. pic.twitter.com/5aiMZ14FoW — World (@worldcoin) May 1, 2025 World Chain revealed that nearly two million users already hold bridged USDC in their World App wallets, and they’re set to upgrade to native USDC issued directly by Circle. Previously, users on World Chain accessed bridged USDC stablecoin through Mini Apps, which allowed them to send remittances with minimal fees. However, upgrading to native USDC, paired with Circle’s Cross-Chain Transfer Protocol (CCTP) V2, will simplify and improve these processes. CCTP V2, which was first introduced in April 2023, is an improved version of Circle’s protocol designed to improve the speed and efficiency of USDC transfers across different blockchains. The future of cross-chain is here with CCTP V2! Now available on @avax , @base , and @ethereum . Support for @LineaBuild , @arbitrum , and @solana is coming soon, with more blockchain expansions expected this year. Fast Transfer: cross-chain USDC settlement in seconds Hooks:… pic.twitter.com/eK9InRuv6W — Circle (@circle) March 11, 2025 While the specific date for the integration has yet to be revealed, the upcoming changes promise major benefits. Users can convert their existing bridged USDC on World Chain into native USDC. Unlike bridged tokens, the native USDC will be fully backed by cash and cash-equivalent assets held in reserve. Transfers to and from the blockchain will also be faster, more reliable, and more secure. Businesses will be able to access the blockchain’s “Institutional On/Off-ramps with Circle Mint” feature. This allows eligible businesses to easily convert between traditional fiat currencies and digital assets like USDC. Developers are not left out. They can integrate USDC directly into Mini Apps on World Chain. Additionally, the blockchain disclosed plans to integrate EURC, a fully regulated euro-backed stablecoin. This will allow World Chain to serve European users needing MiCA-compliant solutions. Will Stablecoin Growth Hit $2 Trillion or Stumble on Regulation? World Chain’s integration of USDC is not surprising. It reflects the broader trend of stablecoins becoming a key part of the digital finance ecosystem. DeFiLlama data shows that $4.902 billion worth of new stablecoins were added in the past week alone. The total stablecoin market is at $242.407 billion. Stablecoin market cap is currently at $242B | Source: DeFiLlama Tether (USDT) continues to dominate the stablecoin sector, commanding a market share of 61.65%. Close competitors include USDC, Ethena’s USDe, and MakerDAO’s DAI. Major financial institutions are also taking notice. Citigroup predicts the stablecoin market could exceed $2 trillion by 2030 . However, it also warns that if regulatory and integration issues remain, it may be capped at $500 billion. U.S. policymakers are weighing in as well. Federal Reserve Governor Christopher Waller acknowledged the potential of dollar-backed stablecoins to reinforce the global role of the U.S. dollar. Meanwhile, Mastercard, a giant in global payments, recently introduced a “360-degree” strategy to support stablecoin payments across over 150 million merchants worldwide. Today, we announced our end-to-end capabilities to support stablecoins, ensuring payments can be made or received using them – anytime, anywhere. Alongside proven leaders across Web3, finance and fintech, we’re empowering consumers and businesses to use stablecoins as easily as… pic.twitter.com/6uSpMlNK9z — Mastercard News (@MastercardNews) April 28, 2025 Stripe, another major player in the payments space, is developing its USD-backed stablecoin . Outside North America and Europe, interest in stablecoins is growing fast, especially in emerging markets. Brazil is a prime example. Itaú Unibanco, one of the country’s largest banks, is exploring the launch of its stablecoin . This follows reports that in September 2024 alone, 4.4 million Brazilians moved $4.2 billion worth of crypto. Stablecoins were the dominant force behind these transactions. They accounted for 71.4% of the total volume, approximately $3 billion . As Latin American adoption soars, EU’s MiCA rules and delayed U.S. guidance loom over the $2T growth forecast. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) How does MiCA affect stablecoins on World Chain? MiCA, the EU’s crypto-asset regulation, mandates strict rules for stablecoins. Issuers must maintain 1:1 reserves, pass audits, and obtain EU authorization. Result? Only compliant coins like USDC and EURC will trade freely in the EU. Others risk delisting. Where is Circle’s CCTP currently deployed? Circle’s CCTP is already live on several leading blockchains, including Ethereum, Arbitrum, Avalanche, and Optimism. CCTP also powers projects like LinearBuild (cross-chain transfers) and SonicLabs (multi-chain DeFi). Does World Chain’s iris-scanning hinder institutions? No. Users can now delete iris codes, boosting data control without limiting institutional appeal.

Dogecoin bullish momentum is picking up pace with price nearing the $0.20 mark, supported by rising open interest and an improving RSI. On the other hand, Solana price forecast remains on edge, trading in a tight range as bulls try to defend key support near $145. Pressure is building, but it’s BlockDAG (BDAG) presale that’s causing the real stir. Its new 25% referral reward has triggered a fresh wave of interest just as the new batch 28 opens. With the $0.0019 special price still live, but only until May 13, and a 2,531% ROI on the table, this referral offer is turning heads for a reason. Solana Price Forecast Hovers at Crucial Range The Solana (SOL) price forecast shows indecision as the asset trades near $149, moving sideways between $145 and $157. After recovering from a drop to $95, Solana has reclaimed support at $120, $130, and $140. Analysts note a cup and handle formation, suggesting potential for a breakout. Solana price forecast also reflects increasing DEX volume and institutional demand. A break above $157 could push SOL toward $170 or higher, while a fall below $145 risks revisiting the $136 zone. For now, the Solana price forecast depends on whether bulls can sustain momentum near this make-or-break level. Dogecoin Bullish Momentum Builds as $0.20 Test Nears Dogecoin bullish momentum is gaining attention following the formation of a falling wedge, a pattern often linked to upward price swings. Currently trading near $0.17, the price has climbed 6% in the past month. Dogecoin bullish momentum is supported by a sharp rise in open interest and an improving RSI. Resistance at $0.20 remains a critical level, and a confirmed breakout could push DOGE toward $0.26. Volume and sentiment remain key factors. While short-term consolidation is possible, Dogecoin’s bullish momentum suggests traders are watching closely for a sustained move beyond near-term resistance. BlockDAG’s Referral Program: Here’s How Holders Can Earn 25% Extra Coins! BlockDAG’s new referral program is turning heads for all the right reasons. It gives 25% in BDAG coins to anyone who refers new buyers, while those buyers also get 5% extra. Both sides benefit, and it’s creating a ripple effect across BlockDAG’s presale. Getting started with the referral program is simple. BDAG holders can find their referral codes on BlockDAG’s dashboard , which they can share with their friends and family. Once someone uses that code to buy BDAG, rewards are triggered instantly. For example, if three referrals each buy $5,000, the referrer earns $3,750 in BDAG, and each referral gets $250 in bonus coins. Now is the best time to put this offer to work. BlockDAG’s presale is entering its final stretch, and the limited-time price of $0.0019 per BDAG is only active until May 13. Buyers are jumping in, and the new referral program has sparked a fresh buying spree that has led to batch 27 selling out. Batch 28 is now live, but the $0.0019 price remains for a short time, even though the original price for this batch is $0.0262. With BDAG confirmed to list at $0.05, that’s a projected ROI of 2,531%. Over $224 million has already been raised in the presale, and 19.6 billion coins have been sold. As the presale edges toward the finish, there’s never been a better moment to refer. It’s simple, it pays well, and it’s moving fast. Not Every Rally Pays Off the Same Way Momentum alone doesn’t tell the full story. Dogecoin bullish momentum is rising, but resistance at $0.20 still blocks the next move. Solana price forecast remains strong, though traders remain cautious near breakout territory. This shows DOGE and SOL are in play, but neither has cleared the hurdle yet. But BlockDAG has already pulled ahead. Its new referral program has sparked a buying streak that sold out batch 27 and pushed batch 28 into overdrive. The $0.0019 offer holds only until May 13, bringing in a 2,531% ROI for anyone who buys BDAGs now. The referral rewards are flowing fast, as buyers line up to grab their share of BDAG for this special price.

Bitcoin is back in the spotlight thanks to recent comments from former President Trump on U.S. tariff deals, hinting that negotiations are “progressing very well.” This upbeat rhetoric lit a fire under BTC charts, with traders now eyeing a breakout toward all-time highs. Meanwhile, Ethereum is gearing up for a major development of its own—the Pectra upgrade, officially launching May 7, which is stirring fresh optimism around ETH’s price potential. But while the crypto giants make headlines, another project is quietly shaking up presale records: Qubetics ($TICS) just crossed 510 million tokens sold, adding to its presale tally of over $16.5 million. Unlike the traditional giants, Qubetics isn’t just hype or halving buzz. It’s building a practical toolset that solves what most chains still haven’t cracked—true, seamless cross-chain access via a non-custodial multi-chain wallet. And it’s doing it while delivering consistent growth with a 10% weekly price increase, making it one of the best altcoins to invest in now for those not looking to wait until the next bull wave crests. With a mainnet drop around the corner and demand accelerating fast, this might be one of those rare windows where price, timing, and use case align perfectly. Qubetics’ Non-Custodial Multi-Chain Wallet Is Solving a Web3 Problem Most Projects Ignore Here’s the thing: most users don’t care which chain they’re using—they just want their crypto tools to work. That’s where Qubetics steps in. At its core, Qubetics is building the world’s first decentralized Web3 aggregator, and one of its star applications is a non-custodial multi-chain wallet that finally lets users hold, send, and receive across leading chains without needing five different apps and three bridges. Picture this: a freelance designer in Miami is paid in USDT on Ethereum, but needs to swap it for SOL to pay a dev in Manila—and later wants to stake leftover tokens on Arbitrum. Normally, that means multiple wallets, gas fees, and risky off-chain steps. Qubetics’ wallet simplifies all of it. It pulls assets from across chains into one dashboard, while keeping full control in the user’s hands—no centralized middlemen, no token wrapping, and no black-box bridges. For NFT collectors flipping between networks, DAOs paying contributors from multichain treasuries, or even casual users trading during bull runs, this wallet is a game-changer. And it’s already becoming a cornerstone of Qubetics’ broader mission to unify Web3 infrastructure. It’s not just a wallet—it’s a gateway. And this kind of real-world value is exactly why Qubetics is lining up as one of the best altcoins to invest in now —even before its mainnet is live. Qubetics Presale Momentum: $0.2093 Entry, Weekly Price Hikes, and Massive ROI Potential—Best Altcoins to Invest in Now? The Qubetics presale isn’t playing around. With the price now at $0.2093 in Stage 32, over 510 million $TICS have been scooped up by more than 25,600 holders, and the clock is ticking before another 10% increase hits this Sunday at midnight. This isn’t a stagnant launch pad with delays and excuses—this is a weekly-updating, revenue-driving presale model that rewards those who don’t wait around. Here’s what makes it spicy: If someone were to drop $100 at today’s price, and $TICS hits $1 after the presale, that’s a 377.76% ROI. At $5, that turns into 2,288.80%. If $TICS hits $10 after the Q2 2025 mainnet launch, we’re looking at 4,677.59%—and if it shoots up to $15, we’re talking 7,066.39%. These aren’t just hypothetical numbers; they’re structured off the project’s pricing model and the consistent growth already recorded. Compared to slower-moving majors, Qubetics offers more immediate upside—especially for early buyers chasing the best crypto pre sale options right now. The limited-time nature of each stage, combined with the rapidly growing ecosystem, makes the Qubetics presale one of the smartest places to park capital while the big players wrestle with macro politics and protocol upgrades. That’s why for many, this isn’t just an altcoin—it’s the best altcoins to invest in now, period. Bitcoin Traders Bet Big as Trump Hints at Trade Progress and Tariff Deals Over on the macro side, Bitcoin is grabbing serious attention after former President Donald Trump’s May 1st comments around U.S. trade talks. According to CoinDesk, Trump stated that tariff discussions were “progressing very well,” which sent waves across financial markets and lit a fire under BTC charts. Traders are now watching for a breakout to new highs, with many eyeing the $75K level as the next psychological threshold. The broader context is hard to ignore—market participants have historically treated Bitcoin as a hedge against geopolitical uncertainty, and with a U.S. election looming and tariff tensions rising, BTC is back in its safe-haven role. And with the crypto market overall regaining its $3 trillion market cap, bullish sentiment is echoing across trading desks. Still, while Bitcoin’s macro setup is strong, its rally hinges on political moves, ETF flows, and global narratives. It doesn’t have the short-term ROI mechanics of a high-velocity presale like Qubetics. So for those looking for a mix of price momentum and product innovation, BTC might be the anchor—but Qubetics could be the rocket. Ethereum’s Pectra Upgrade Drops May 7—Will It Finally Spark a Rally? Ethereum isn’t sitting idle either. On April 30, Binance reported that the highly anticipated Pectra upgrade is officially launching on May 7, marking one of the most significant Ethereum updates since the Merge. This upgrade bundles multiple Ethereum Improvement Proposals (EIPs) aimed at optimizing wallet security, gas efficiency, and developer tooling—all of which are vital for scaling dApps and onboarding new users. Still, ETH has been trailing Bitcoin in performance over the last 30 days. Many community members are betting that Pectra could serve as the spark ETH needs to regain momentum and possibly retest $3,500+ zones. But even with a strong tech narrative, the market response remains cautious. Price volatility around major updates is nothing new, and Ethereum still faces stiff competition from L2s and alt-L1 ecosystems. While Ethereum remains a juggernaut in the crypto space, it’s also become a slower-moving one. Qubetics, on the other hand, is dropping weekly news, increasing in price every 7 days, and solving user pain points Ethereum still hasn’t fully addressed—like multichain asset management. For that reason alone, many are calling $TICS one of the best altcoins to invest in now—especially if the focus is on real-world adoption and actual movement. Conclusion: Qubetics Is Breaking Records While Bitcoin and Ethereum Prep for Macro Moves Bitcoin is climbing on Trump’s trade optimism. Ethereum’s got Pectra locked and loaded for May 7. But Qubetics? It’s selling out tokens by the hundreds of millions, raking in over $16.6 million, and growing in value every single week. While the giants prepare their next chapter, Qubetics is actively writing one. It’s turning its non-custodial, multichain wallet into a real-world solution, and its community-first presale structure gives it serious upside. So for those looking to stack high-growth tokens before they break into the mainstream, Qubetics checks every box—solid application, predictable growth, and timed price triggers. With just days before the next price bump and a mainnet coming in Q2 2025, this just might be the best altcoins to invest in now. Anyone ready to join this crypto presale shouldn’t wait too long—the clock’s ticking, and this ride is already moving fast.

Qubetics ($TICS) is leading with weekly price increases, 510M tokens sold, and strong ROI projections based on real market demand. What is the Qubetics presale price today? As of Stage 32, the price is $0.2093. It increases by 10% every Sunday at 12 AM, making early entries time-sensitive. Is Ethereum still a good altcoin in 2025? Ethereum’s Pectra upgrade on May 7 could boost utility and price, but it moves slower compared to new high-growth presale tokens like Qubetics.

Since then, the SEC, in line with President Trump, has taken a far less adversarial stance towards the cryptocurrency industry, as evidenced by the appointment of crypto-friendly personnel and the abandonment of numerous lawsuits and investigations into crypto companies. But DOGE has the potential to implement further change, and interest in the SEC signals growing pressure towards regulators to reassess their approach to digital assets. In response to the request for public input, Paul Grewal, Chief Legal Officer at Coinbase — one of the companies no longer facing a lawsuit from the SEC — proposed a policy requiring the SEC to reimburse legal costs for companies that successfully challenge enforcement efforts. The motivation for his suggestion is obvious, but the impact of DOGE on crypto will likely be a bit broader. As Joel Khalili summarized in Wired , the SEC’s recent retreat from lawsuits represents “an early signal of the agency’s intent to work arm in arm with the industry to come up with a set of rules to govern crypto transactions and products.” As things currently stand, the SEC’s lack of proactive guidance makes it difficult for businesses to plan long-term compliance strategies, and their enforcement actions often come after years of operation, leaving companies and their investors exposed to unforeseen legal risks. Going forward, this will likely change. Clear Compliance Over Reactive Enforcement Relying on enforcement instead of proactive guidance has forced companies like Coinbase, Ripple, and Celsius to spend millions in litigation to clarify their regulatory standing. But in one case against Debt Box , the SEC admitted to inaccuracies in its statements, leading a court to order the SEC to cover the company’s legal expenses — a preview of Coinbase’s suggestion. The ruling cast doubt on the agency’s credibility and highlighted concerns over its enforcement practices. In the future, expect to see regulatory agencies – including the SEC – under increased pressure to align with the U.S. Treasury’s approach, which prioritizes clear compliance pathways over reactive enforcement. The Treasury’s digital asset guidelines are far more structured and address key areas like tax reporting, compliance and AML measures. Standardized definitions of what constitutes a security in the crypto space are essential for helping companies structure their products appropriately from the outset. A Balancing Act In addition to taking notes from the Treasury, the SEC can also look to the IRS for inspiration. A “safe harbor” provision for early-stage projects could encourage innovation while ensuring compliance over time, similar to proposals previously discussed by SEC Commissioner Hester Peirce. The IRS already embraced this approach, issuing temporary transitional relief for crypto taxpayers in January 2025. The IRS historically relied on voluntary disclosure programs to bring taxpayers into compliance rather than imposing punitive actions upfront. A similar model should be applied to crypto regulation as well. While some people assume regulation inherently hinders innovation, the opposite can be true. This is because clearly defined guardrails will entice more risk-averse entities to enter the ecosystem and help it grow. A light regulatory touch requires robust backend enforcement and can lead to unnecessary friction between regulators and businesses. Altogether, better coordination between the SEC, Treasury, and IRS would help prevent regulatory conflicts and streamline compliance obligations for digital asset companies and stakeholders. The Treasury’s digital asset guidelines already offer a strong foundation for this type of cross-agency alignment. The current regulatory uncertainty and the SEC’s reactive enforcement approach stifles growth, while a clearer, more coordinated framework would benefit the entire ecosystem. The Bottom Line Between the DOGE’s request for input, the new administration's broader commitment to digital asset reform, and Coinbase’s proposal, the stage is set for reforms aiming to make regulatory oversight more predictable. While we are in the early stages of the new administration, changes are already occurring at a staggering pace. It’s clear that DOGE’s influence on SEC policies will make an impact – especially with public discourse on these issues further strengthening the case for clearer guidelines rather than regulation by enforcement. Of course, it’s worth noting that DOGE’s plans for the SEC will likely extend beyond crypto, just as efforts to regulate the industry extend beyond the SEC. Ultimately, it would be beneficial for the new administration, in conjunction with Congress, to create a legislative framework for the industry, so enterprises and individual taxpayers alike understand what constitutes a commodity, security, and digital asset. In other words, we must learn to walk before we run. In the meantime, the SEC should adopt a strategy that can foster growth while maintaining investor protections.",Opinion|Opinion,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|DOGE|EXCHANGE|REGULATION,"{'name': 'CoinDesk', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/5/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coindesk,2025-05-02 17:17:15

Bezos, who quit as CEO of the Seattle-based tech company in the middle of 2021, will sell up to 25 million shares . He will follow through with a planned sale that will last until the end of May 2026. According to Amazon’s most recent quarterly report, the trade plan was made in early March. Bezos is directing his funds to other projects Bezos has been trying to cut down his expenses. The first thing he did was to move from Washington to Florida. According to research done by Forbes, Florida is a better place for billionaires like Bezos to sell their assets than his old home state of Washington, which just put a 7% tax on long-term capital gains of more than $250,000. This is because Florida doesn’t have either a state income tax or a capital gains tax. If Bezos had still lived in Washington when he sold his shares, he would have had to pay $954 million in state capital gains tax last year. With other deductions and credits, he may still owe about $3.2 billion to the federal government. After moving, Bezos sold more than $13.4 billion worth of Amazon stock. The same year, the company’s market value grew to more than $2 trillion. This was largely due to investors’ excitement about AI. The second-richest person in the world has slowly taken his attention off of the online store he started in 1994 and put it back on his space company, Blue Origin, and the US newspaper, The Washington Post. Bezos is the only partner in Blue Origin and has sold Amazon shares to help pay for it. To compete with Elon Musk’s SpaceX, Jeff Bezos’s space exploration business, Blue Origin wants to adopt Amazon’s focus on results-driven work style. Blue Origin’s CEO Dave Limp and CFO Allen Parker are two people that Bezos hired from Amazon. Blue Origin has only sent one rocket into orbit so far, while SpaceX has sent over 400 ships into orbit. Bezos has also sold both large amounts of Amazon stock and smaller amounts to raise money for charitable causes. For example, he started the Day One Fund, an educational Montessori-inspired non-profit organization. Amazon’s stock is taking a hit. The news came just hours after Amazon announced on Thursday night that it expected net sales and operating income to be lower than what Wall Street had expected. This is mainly because of President Trump’s trade war with other countries. To lessen the effects of tariffs, Amazon has been negotiating big discounts with suppliers. About a quarter of the things it sells come from China. Before Amazon’s earnings report, Goldman Sachs analysts said that the tariffs could cut the company’s operating profits by $5bn to $10bn this year, based on how the trade war turned out. That would take a 6–12% bite out of the $79.2bn operating earnings that Wall Street expects for the new fiscal year. On Thursday, the Seattle-based company thought it would make between $13 billion and $17.5 billion in operating income this quarter. That’s less than the $17.7 billion that Wall Street expected, but it was more than the $14.7 billion made last year. Amazon stock price | Source: Google Finance Amazon also said that its net sales for the current quarter would be between $159 billion and $164 billion, which is less than the $161.4 billion that experts were expecting. Meanwhile, Amazon stocks are down 0.19%, trading at 189.84. Cryptopolitan Academy: Want to grow your money in 2025? Learn how to do it with DeFi in our upcoming webclass.

What’s Next?",https://cryptonews.com/news/move-token-70-crash-founder-probe-coinbase-halt/,"Movement Network’s utility token, MOVE, plunged by over 20% in just 24 hours as investors fled amid leadership chaos and market concerns. Since launching its mainnet beta and token in December 2024, the Ethereum Layer-2 modular network has greatly underperformed. Despite reaching a $2.5 billion market cap in early January, fueled by a $100 million Series B round valuing the project at $3 billion , $MOVE’s current market cap has collapsed to under $500 million, marking a 70% decline. What Went Wrong with $MOVE’s Price and Market Makers? Much of the $MOVE token’s downward pressure has been attributed to poor market-making strategies and recent governance challenges. In the early hours of May 2, Movement Labs announced the suspension of co-founder Rushi Manche , citing an ongoing third-party review of governance procedures and market maker-related activities. https://twitter.com/movementlabsxyz/status/1918134801028268187 Popular crypto influencer Ansem, an early investor in the project, expressed his frustration on X (formerly Twitter), calling $MOVE “the worst investment” he has ever made. Further intensifying the situation, Coinbase announced it would suspend trading of $MOVE on May 15, transitioning order books to limit-only mode. We regularly monitor the assets on our exchange to ensure they meet our listing standards. Based on recent reviews, we will suspend trading for Movement (MOVE) on May 15, 2025, on or around 2 PM ET. — Coinbase Assets (@CoinbaseAssets) May 1, 2025 This comes weeks after Binance froze the profits of a market maker accused of offloading large volumes of $MOVE, prompting questions about the project’s token distribution and management. Is Co-Founder Rushi Manche Truly Involved in the $MOVE Price Manipulation? Internal investigations have revealed that 5% of $MOVE tokens allocated to Web3Port somehow ended up with Rentech, a firm that quickly liquidated its position. Co-founder Cooper Scanlon disclosed in a Slack message that the situation was being reviewed. An internal memo from a Movement Co-founder – Source: Slack Documents from a third-party review alleged that there were incentives to pump $MOVE’s fully diluted value (FDV) to $5 billion before dumping tokens on the open market. The agreement stipulated that if this FDV threshold was reached, Rentech could sell and share profits with others, raising suspicions about Manche’s involvement, as he was linked to sharing the agreement. The contract said: If $MOVE reached a $5B value, they could sell everything. And split the profits. A perfect setup to pump the price and dump on everyone. (4/9) pic.twitter.com/860wIZxnWk — StarPlatinum (@StarPlatinumSOL) May 1, 2025 On April 30, Manche took to X to acknowledge missteps , stating the team “trusted the wrong advisors” and mishandled operations during a turbulent market. Investigations are ongoing into whether Manche or advisors were more deeply involved than previously disclosed. Traders Speculate Despite Bearish Sentiment Despite the controversies, some traders see an opportunity to buy the dip. According to CoinGlass, $MOVE’s open interest surged by 50.65%, while trading volume skyrocketed by 695%, surpassing $1.3 billion in the past 24 hours. $MOVE derivative market data – Source: CoinGlass The long/short ratio currently stands at 0.9778, with more than $1.3 million worth of short positions liquidated, suggesting some traders are betting on a potential short squeeze or reversal. Technical Analysis: $MOVE Trapped in a Descending Wedge Technically, the $MOVE/USDT daily chart has shown a persistent downtrend throughout 2025, characterized by lower highs and lower lows. However, the price appears to be stabilizing within the $0.11 to $0.13 range, aligning with the 0.236 Fibonacci retracement level, a zone that could act as short-term support. The $MOVE token approaches the upper boundary of a falling wedge pattern, a formation typically viewed as a bullish reversal pattern. A confirmed breakout above this wedge, especially with a daily close above the 9-day SMA at $0.2307, could mark a potential trend reversal. Should this breakout occur, Fibonacci extensions point to possible resistance levels at $0.2950, $0.4248, $0.5547, and $0.6349. On the flip side, failure to hold above the support zone around $0.1185 or $0.0849 could result in further downside and continued investor pessimism.

44075500,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=154707,1746206689,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Fed Rate Cut Hopes Dim: Crucial US Jobs Report Warning for Crypto,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/fed-rate-cut-warning/,"Why should a report about hiring numbers in the United States matter to someone interested in Bitcoin, Ethereum, or other digital assets? The connection might not be immediately obvious, but the latest US jobs report holds significant weight for the broader economy and, by extension, the volatile world of cryptocurrency. Understanding these macroeconomic forces is crucial for navigating the market. Understanding the Latest US Jobs Report The April US jobs report landed with a clear message: the labor market remains remarkably resilient. According to the data, steady hiring continued, adding more jobs than many analysts had predicted. This strength is a key piece of the puzzle the Federal Reserve uses when considering its monetary policy decisions, particularly regarding interest rates. Here are some key takeaways from the report: Steady Job Growth: The economy continued to add jobs at a healthy pace. Low Unemployment: The unemployment rate remained low, indicating that most people seeking work can find it. Wage Growth: While not accelerating wildly, wage growth remained firm. Collectively, these figures paint a picture of an economy that is not experiencing significant labor market weakness. This is positive news for overall economic health, but it has specific implications for the timing of potential interest rate adjustments. How the April Jobs Report Impacts the Fed Rate Cut Decision The primary tool the Federal Reserve uses to manage inflation and economic growth is adjusting the benchmark interest rate. When the economy is overheating, the Fed raises rates to cool things down. When it’s slowing down, they cut rates to stimulate activity. A strong labor market, as indicated by the April US jobs report , is generally seen as inflationary. When lots of people are employed and wages are growing, consumers have more money to spend, increasing demand for goods and services. This increased demand can push prices higher, contributing to inflation. Therefore, evidence of continued labor market strength gives the Federal Reserve less reason to cut interest rates quickly. Their stated goal is to bring inflation back down to their target of 2%. If the economy is still robust, particularly in the labor sector, the Fed might fear that cutting rates too soon could reignite inflationary pressures. According to insights shared by WSJ’s Nick Timiraos, a widely followed voice on Fed policy, the combination of limited time before the June meeting and the lack of clear signals indicating a significant weakening in unemployment makes a near-term Fed rate cut highly unlikely. Officials are likely to maintain a cautious stance, prioritizing their fight against inflation over stimulating the economy through lower borrowing costs at this juncture. What the Interest Rate Outlook Means for Markets The interest rate outlook is one of the most significant drivers of financial markets globally. Changes in interest rates affect borrowing costs for businesses and consumers, the profitability of banks, the attractiveness of different asset classes, and overall economic sentiment. When interest rates are high or expected to remain high: Borrowing becomes more expensive, potentially slowing down business investment and consumer spending on big-ticket items like cars and homes. Fixed-income investments like bonds become more attractive relative to riskier assets. The cost of capital increases for companies, which can impact stock valuations. Conversely, when interest rates are low or expected to fall, the opposite tends to happen, generally providing a tailwind for riskier assets. The current interest rate outlook , shaped by data like the April jobs report, suggests that the period of relatively higher borrowing costs might persist longer than some market participants had hoped. This recalibration of expectations can lead to shifts in investment strategies and market volatility. Deciphering Economic Signals for Crypto Investors Cryptocurrency markets, while often driven by their own unique dynamics (like technological developments, adoption rates, and market sentiment), do not exist in a vacuum. They are increasingly influenced by broader macroeconomic trends and the global financial environment. Understanding key economic signals , such as those from the jobs report and inflation data, is vital for crypto investors because: Risk Appetite: Higher interest rates generally reduce investor appetite for risk. Crypto is widely considered a risk-on asset. When safer investments offer better returns (due to higher interest rates), or when the economic outlook is uncertain, investors may pull back from riskier bets like crypto. Liquidity: Central bank policies affect the overall amount of money flowing through the financial system. Quantitative easing (QE) and lower rates increase liquidity, which can flow into assets like crypto. Quantitative tightening (QT) and higher rates reduce liquidity, potentially creating headwinds. Narrative: Crypto’s narrative as a hedge against inflation or a store of value can be tested by real-world inflation data and the Fed’s response to it. The April jobs report is a strong economic signal that the Fed feels comfortable keeping rates elevated, at least for now. This signal suggests that the macro environment may not become significantly more favorable for risk assets like crypto in the immediate future based purely on interest rate cuts. The Crypto Market Implications of Delayed Rate Cuts So, what are the specific Crypto market implications of the likely delay in a Fed rate cut ? While crypto markets are complex and influenced by many factors, a prolonged period of higher interest rates can present challenges. Potential implications include: Reduced Inflows: Institutional investors and even retail investors might prefer holding cash or lower-risk fixed-income assets yielding attractive returns, rather than allocating heavily to volatile crypto assets. Pressure on Prices: Without the tailwind of falling interest rates that often boosts risk assets, crypto prices might face downward pressure or struggle to achieve significant upward momentum solely based on macro factors. Focus on Fundamentals: In a less favorable macro environment, the focus might shift more towards the fundamental value propositions of individual crypto projects – their technology, adoption, and real-world use cases – rather than benefiting from broad market liquidity. It’s important to remember that crypto markets can be unpredictable and are influenced by events specific to the crypto space (like regulatory news, technological upgrades, or major adoption announcements). However, ignoring the macro backdrop shaped by economic signals like the jobs report and the resulting interest rate outlook would be a mistake for any serious crypto investor. Actionable Insights for Crypto Investors Given this information, what steps can crypto investors consider? Here are a few actionable insights: Stay Informed: Continue monitoring key economic data releases (inflation reports, jobs reports, GDP) and statements from the Federal Reserve. These provide vital context for market movements. Understand the Macro Picture: Don’t just focus on crypto charts. Develop a basic understanding of how interest rates, inflation, and economic growth influence risk asset markets globally. Manage Risk: In an environment with macro headwinds, risk management becomes even more critical. This might involve diversifying your portfolio, using stop-loss orders, or adjusting your position sizes. Focus on Long-Term Conviction: If you believe in the long-term potential of specific crypto projects, short-term macro fluctuations can be viewed as noise. However, ensure your conviction is based on solid fundamentals, not just hope for a rate cut driven pump. Be Patient: Market cycles are influenced by many factors, including the interest rate outlook . Patience is often rewarded in volatile markets. While the April jobs report doesn’t spell doom for crypto, it serves as a clear reminder that the path to lower interest rates might be longer and bumpier than anticipated. This macro reality is an important factor to consider in your investment strategy. Conclusion: Navigating the Economic Headwinds The April US jobs report has sent a strong signal to the market and the Federal Reserve: the labor market remains robust. This strength reduces the urgency for the Fed to cut interest rates, making a June Fed rate cut appear increasingly unlikely. This recalibrated interest rate outlook , driven by clear economic signals , has tangible Crypto market implications . For crypto investors, this means navigating a macro environment that may not provide the immediate tailwinds of falling interest rates. While crypto’s unique characteristics and developments will continue to play a major role, understanding and reacting to these broader economic forces is essential for making informed decisions and managing expectations in the months ahead.

44075574,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=154706,1746206700,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Ethereum: Shocking $380M ETH Exodus from CEXs – What it Means for the Crypto Market,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/ethereum-eth-cex-outflows/,"A significant shift is happening in the world of cryptocurrency, particularly concerning Ethereum (ETH). Recent data from IntoTheBlock reveals a staggering net outflow of approximately $380 million worth of Ethereum (ETH) from Centralized Exchanges (CEXs) over the past seven days. This substantial movement of assets away from platforms like Coinbase, Binance, and Kraken isn’t just a number; it’s a strong signal that could have meaningful implications for the entire Crypto Market . Why Are Investors Moving Ethereum (ETH) Off CEXs? The decision to withdraw assets from a Centralized Exchange (CEX) is often a deliberate one, driven by various factors related to security, control, and investment strategy. When we see large ETH Outflows like the $380 million figure reported, it suggests a collective action among a significant portion of Ethereum (ETH) holders. But what exactly prompts this move? Seeking Self-Custody: One of the primary reasons is the desire for greater control and security. Holding Ethereum (ETH) in a non-custodial wallet (like a hardware wallet or a software wallet where the user holds the private keys) removes counterparty risk associated with exchanges. If a CEX faces hacks, regulatory issues, or solvency problems, user funds can be at risk. Self-custody puts the user in complete control of their assets. Participation in Decentralized Finance (DeFi): The Ethereum network is the backbone of a vast DeFi ecosystem. To interact with decentralized applications (dApps), provide liquidity, yield farm, or borrow/lend assets on platforms like Uniswap, Aave, or MakerDAO, users typically need to connect a non-custodial wallet. Moving Ethereum (ETH) off a CEX is a necessary step to engage in these activities. Staking ETH: With the Merge and subsequent upgrades, staking Ethereum (ETH) to earn rewards has become a popular option. While some CEXs offer staking services, many users prefer to stake directly through decentralized protocols (like Lido or Rocket Pool) or run their own validators for potentially better returns, more control, or to support decentralization. This requires moving ETH out of the exchange environment. Long-Term Holding (HODLing): Investors who plan to hold their Ethereum (ETH) for extended periods often feel more comfortable storing it offline in cold storage or hardware wallets. This minimizes the temptation to trade impulsively and provides a higher level of security against online threats targeting exchanges. Large outflows can indicate strong long-term conviction among holders. Privacy Concerns: While CEXs require KYC (Know Your Customer) information, self-custody wallets offer a degree of privacy, as transactions are recorded on the public blockchain but not directly tied to a user’s real-world identity unless they interact with regulated services. The scale of these recent ETH Outflows suggests that a combination of these factors is likely at play, indicating a growing preference for decentralized activities and self-custody among Ethereum (ETH) holders. Understanding ETH Outflows and Their Significance Through On-Chain Data On-Chain Data provides a transparent window into the movements of cryptocurrencies on their respective blockchains. Tools like those offered by IntoTheBlock analyze this data to track flows into and out of entities like exchanges, whales, and smart contracts. The net change in assets held on Centralized Exchanges (CEXs) is a key metric derived from On-Chain Data , and it offers valuable insights: When there are significant ETH Outflows from CEXs, it typically means: Reduced Selling Pressure: Assets held on exchanges are generally considered more liquid and readily available for trading or selling. When a large amount of Ethereum (ETH) leaves exchanges, the immediate supply available for selling on these platforms decreases. This can potentially reduce selling pressure in the short to medium term. Indicator of Accumulation: Large outflows often coincide with periods where investors are accumulating assets for long-term holding or use in DeFi/staking, rather than keeping them on an exchange for potential quick sale. This can be interpreted as a bullish signal, reflecting strong holder conviction. Increased Activity in Decentralized Ecosystems: Outflows can precede or coincide with increased activity in the DeFi and staking sectors, as users move their Ethereum (ETH) to participate in these decentralized protocols. Conversely, net inflows to exchanges can sometimes signal potential increased selling pressure or a shift from decentralized activities back to centralized trading platforms. Monitoring these trends through On-Chain Data is crucial for understanding broader market sentiment and potential future price movements in the Crypto Market . Impact on the Crypto Market: What $380M in ETH Outflows Could Mean The withdrawal of $380 million worth of Ethereum (ETH) from Centralized Exchanges (CEXs) in just seven days is a substantial event for the Crypto Market . To put it in perspective, this represents a significant portion of the liquid supply readily available for trading on these major platforms. Here’s how it could impact the market: Potential Price Implications: Reduced Supply, Increased Scarcity: With less Ethereum (ETH) sitting on exchanges, the available supply for buyers to purchase directly from these platforms decreases. If demand remains constant or increases, reduced supply can lead to upward pressure on the price. Indicator of Bullish Sentiment: As mentioned, large outflows are often associated with accumulation and long-term holding. This behavior reflects confidence in Ethereum (ETH) ‘s future price potential, contributing to positive market sentiment. Liquidity Shifts: While liquidity on CEXs might decrease, it could potentially increase in decentralized liquidity pools (on DEXs like Uniswap) as users move their ETH into DeFi. However, overall ease of buying/selling large amounts on centralized order books might be affected. Broader Market Signals: Growing Adoption of Decentralization: The trend of moving assets off CEXs highlights the increasing comfort and willingness of users to engage directly with the decentralized aspects of the Crypto Market , whether through self-custody, DeFi, or staking. Maturity of the Ecosystem: The fact that such large values are being moved off exchanges smoothly demonstrates the increasing robustness and usability of non-custodial wallets and decentralized protocols. While outflows don’t guarantee a price increase, they are historically viewed as a potentially bullish indicator due to the reasons outlined above. It signals that a large amount of Ethereum (ETH) is being moved into positions less likely to be sold in the immediate future. The Shift Towards Self-Custody: Benefits and Challenges for Ethereum (ETH) Holders The trend of substantial ETH Outflows from Centralized Exchanges (CEXs) underscores a growing movement towards self-custody. This involves users taking direct control of their private keys, and thus their Ethereum (ETH) , outside of a third-party platform. Let’s look at the benefits and challenges: Benefits of Self-Custody: True Ownership: You hold the private keys, meaning you have absolute control over your Ethereum (ETH) . No exchange downtime, withdrawal limits, or account freezes can prevent you from accessing your funds. Enhanced Security (When Done Correctly): While CEXs are targets for hackers, self-custody wallets, especially hardware wallets, offer robust security against online theft if best practices are followed (like securing your seed phrase). Access to DeFi and Staking: As discussed, self-custody is essential for participating in the vibrant Ethereum DeFi ecosystem and staking your ETH directly on the network or via decentralized protocols to earn rewards. Privacy: Transactions are pseudonymous on the blockchain, offering more privacy compared to KYC-verified accounts on CEXs. Challenges of Self-Custody: Full Responsibility: There is no customer support if you lose your private keys or seed phrase. Losing access means losing your Ethereum (ETH) forever. This is the biggest challenge. Complexity: Setting up and securely managing non-custodial wallets, especially hardware wallets, can be more complex than using a CEX account, particularly for beginners. Transaction Costs: Interacting with the Ethereum network (sending ETH, using dApps) requires paying gas fees, which can sometimes be high depending on network congestion. Risk of User Error: Sending funds to the wrong address or falling victim to phishing scams if not vigilant are risks inherent in managing your own keys. Here’s a simplified comparison: Feature Centralized Exchange (CEX) Self-Custody Wallet Key Management Exchange holds keys User holds keys Control Limited (subject to exchange rules) Complete Security Exchange’s responsibility (risk of hacks, insolvency) User’s responsibility (risk of lost keys, user error; high security with hardware wallets) Access to DeFi/Staking Limited (often simplified services) Full (direct interaction with protocols) Ease of Use Generally easier for beginners Can be more complex The large ETH Outflows suggest that a growing number of users are weighing these factors and opting for the control and opportunities offered by self-custody, despite the added responsibility. Actionable Insights from On-Chain Data for the Crypto Market Tracking metrics like ETH Outflows from Centralized Exchanges (CEXs) using On-Chain Data provides valuable insights for anyone involved in the Crypto Market . What can you do with this information? Monitor Exchange Balances: Keep an eye on the total amount of Ethereum (ETH) held on exchanges. Sustained decreases can signal reduced selling pressure and potential bullish momentum. Tools from providers like IntoTheBlock or Glassnode can help track this. Analyze Outflow Destination: While difficult to pinpoint the exact wallet every time, On-Chain Data can sometimes show if outflows are going to known DeFi protocols, staking addresses, or newly active wallets, giving clues about the holders’ intentions (e.g., staking vs. pure storage). Combine with Other Metrics: Don’t look at ETH Outflows in isolation. Combine this data point with other On-Chain Data metrics such as network activity, transaction volume, stablecoin flows, and whale movements for a more comprehensive market picture. Assess Market Sentiment: Large, consistent outflows often reflect strong underlying conviction among long-term holders, which can be a positive sign for overall market sentiment regarding Ethereum (ETH) . Inform Your Strategy: Understanding these macro-level movements can help inform your own investment strategy. For example, sustained outflows during a price dip might indicate strong accumulation interest. The $380 million in recent ETH Outflows serves as a prime example of how On-Chain Data can highlight significant trends impacting the Crypto Market and specific assets like Ethereum (ETH) . Conclusion: What the Shocking ETH Exodus Signifies The recent data showing a shocking $380 million net outflow of Ethereum (ETH) from Centralized Exchanges (CEXs) over the past week is a powerful indicator. It highlights a significant shift in holder behavior, moving away from keeping assets readily available for trading on exchanges towards self-custody, participation in decentralized finance, and staking. This trend, visible through the lens of On-Chain Data , suggests strong conviction among Ethereum (ETH) holders and a potential reduction in immediate selling pressure on CEXs. For the broader Crypto Market , it underscores the growing maturity and adoption of decentralized alternatives and could be interpreted as a bullish signal for Ethereum (ETH) as more supply moves into longer-term or utility-driven holdings.

While our primary focus here is often the dynamic world of cryptocurrencies, it’s crucial to keep an eye on traditional financial markets, especially the U.S. Stock Market . Why? Because the movements in stocks, bonds, and other traditional assets often provide valuable context and can even influence the crypto landscape. Today, the news from Wall Street is certainly noteworthy, with major indices kicking off the trading day on a decidedly positive note. The Morning Bell Rings: A Strong Market Open The excitement was palpable on the trading floors as the U.S. Stock Market officially opened for business today. All three major indices started the session trading higher, signaling a positive sentiment among investors right from the get-go. This kind of broad-based strength across the board is often seen as a bullish sign, suggesting that market participants are feeling optimistic about the near-term outlook. Let’s break down the performance of the key indices at the Market Open : Index Change Today S&P 500 +0.99% NASDAQ Composite +0.9% Dow Jones Industrial Average +1.03% As you can see, the gains were significant across the board, with the Dow Jones leading the pack slightly, but both the S&P 500 and NASDAQ showing robust increases as well. This synchronized move higher indicates that the positive sentiment isn’t confined to just one sector or type of stock, which can be a powerful signal. Decoding the Gains: What’s Driving the U.S. Stock Market Higher? So, what’s behind this optimistic start to the trading day? Several factors typically influence the U.S. Stock Market at any given time. Today’s positive open could be attributed to a confluence of recent developments: Positive Economic Data: Sometimes, recent economic reports (like employment figures, inflation data, or manufacturing indices) paint a brighter picture of the economy, boosting investor confidence. Strong Corporate Earnings: If companies are reporting better-than-expected profits, it signals underlying business health and can drive stock prices up. Shifting Federal Reserve Expectations: Anticipation of future interest rate decisions by the Federal Reserve is a major market mover. Hopes for rate cuts or a pause in hikes can make stocks more attractive. Investor Sentiment: Sometimes, it’s simply a wave of positive sentiment or ‘risk-on’ appetite returning to the market after a period of caution. Global Developments: International news, geopolitical events, or performance in overseas markets can also spill over and affect the U.S. Stock Market . While the exact primary driver today might be debated by analysts, the combined effect has clearly created fertile ground for stocks to rally right out of the gate after the Market Open . Understanding the Big Three: S&P 500, NASDAQ, and Dow Jones For those new to traditional markets, let’s quickly touch upon what these indices represent and why their performance matters: S&P 500: Widely considered the best gauge of large-cap U.S. equities, the S&P 500 tracks the performance of 500 of the largest publicly traded companies in the United States. Its movement reflects the health of a broad cross-section of the American economy. NASDAQ Composite: Heavily weighted towards technology and growth stocks, the NASDAQ Composite includes almost all stocks listed on the NASDAQ exchange. Its performance is often seen as a key indicator for the tech sector and innovative companies. Dow Jones Industrial Average: One of the oldest and most well-known indices, the Dow Jones tracks 30 large, publicly owned companies based in the United States. While not as broad as the S&P 500, its components are often household names and leaders in their respective industries, making its movement highly symbolic. Seeing all three of these indices moving higher together at the Market Open suggests that the positive momentum is relatively widespread across different sectors and company types within the U.S. Stock Market . Connecting the Dots: How the U.S. Stock Market Impacts the Crypto World Now, for the question many of you are likely asking: What does a strong day in the U.S. Stock Market mean for Bitcoin, Ethereum, and other cryptocurrencies? The relationship between traditional markets and crypto is complex and has evolved over time. In the early days, crypto often seemed uncorrelated or even inversely correlated with stocks. However, as cryptocurrencies have gained mainstream attention and institutional adoption, their correlation with traditional risk assets, particularly tech stocks (which the NASDAQ heavily represents), has increased significantly. Here’s how the connection often plays out: Risk-On/Risk-Off Sentiment: When investors are feeling optimistic (‘risk-on’), they tend to favor assets perceived as having higher growth potential, including both growth stocks (often in the NASDAQ ) and cryptocurrencies. Conversely, in ‘risk-off’ environments, investors flock to safer assets, selling off both stocks and crypto. A strong Market Open in stocks often signals a ‘risk-on’ mood, which can be positive for crypto. Liquidity: Strong stock market performance can sometimes free up capital or increase investor confidence, potentially leading to flows into other asset classes, including crypto. Institutional Overlap: Many institutional investors now allocate capital to both traditional stocks and digital assets. Their portfolio decisions in one market can influence their activity in the other. Macro Factors: The same macroeconomic factors (inflation, interest rates, economic growth) that drive the U.S. Stock Market also heavily influence the crypto market. Both react to signals from the Federal Reserve, government policies, and global economic health. While correlation isn’t causation, a positive start for the S&P 500 , NASDAQ , and Dow Jones is generally viewed as a supportive backdrop for the crypto market, rather than a headwind. It suggests that the broader market sentiment is leaning towards growth and higher-risk assets. Are There Any Challenges or Headwinds? Despite the strong Market Open , it’s always wise to remember that markets can be volatile. Today’s positive start doesn’t guarantee the rest of the day, week, or month will follow suit. Potential challenges for the U.S. Stock Market and, by extension, potentially the crypto market, include: Lingering inflation concerns Uncertainty about the future path of interest rates Geopolitical tensions Unexpected negative corporate news Shifts in consumer spending or confidence Investors should remain aware of these potential headwinds, even on a positive day like today. The market’s reaction to upcoming economic data releases or corporate announcements will be crucial in determining if this initial strength at the Market Open can be sustained. What Does This Mean for You? Actionable Insights For those of us primarily focused on crypto, today’s strong Market Open in the U.S. Stock Market serves as a good reminder of the interconnectedness of global finance. Here are a few takeaways: Stay Informed: Don’t just watch crypto charts. Keep an eye on major economic indicators and the performance of traditional indices like the S&P 500 , NASDAQ , and Dow Jones . Understand Correlation: Recognize that while not perfect, there is a notable correlation between risk assets in traditional finance and cryptocurrencies. A major move in one can often signal a potential move in the other. Think Macro: The same macroeconomic forces driving stock markets (inflation, rates, growth) are also key drivers for crypto prices. Diversification: For those investing in both, understanding these relationships is key to managing a diversified portfolio effectively. Today’s positive start is encouraging, but it’s just one data point in a constantly moving market landscape. Conclusion: Navigating the Interconnected Markets Today’s Market Open saw the U.S. Stock Market demonstrate significant strength, with the S&P 500 , NASDAQ , and Dow Jones all posting solid gains. This positive start is likely fueled by a combination of factors, potentially including favorable economic signals or improving investor sentiment. While our core interest lies in digital assets, the performance of these major indices is a vital piece of the puzzle, often providing context and influencing the broader ‘risk-on’ or ‘risk-off’ environment that also affects the crypto market.

The analytical forecast by Javon Marks targets Dogecoin to reach $1.25 in 2025 from its current $0.1828 value. The crypto market receives a boost from Mutuum Finance (MUTM) as they sell 430 million tokens worth $7.3 million during presale phase 4 to 9,200 holders. Investors show great enthusiasm for this DeFi project because it comes at a price point of $0.025. The meme-powered Dogecoin increase seeks to outpace Mutuum Finance’s strategic June growth trajectory but analysts don’t see it happening. Dogecoin’s Bullish Flicker Dogecoin displays positive signals for its future performance. The market shows a positive trend as Bitcoin rises because Dogecoin bounced back from $0.1316 to $0.1828. The 5-day chart displays two bullish candlesticks according to Marks which suggests the price might surpass the $0.20 resistance. The market momentum of Dogecoin could cause its price to reach $0.6533 before hitting the next target at $1.25. Yet, hurdles loom. Dogecoin faces an insurmountable obstacle at the $0.20 resistance so its price increase could stall unless strong buying activity emerges. The market-reliant nature and Bitcoin performance indicators of Dogecoin trigger speculative characteristics that make investors hesitant because of associated price volatility. History shows that Dogecoin has the ability to increase dramatically just as it did when it went up by an astonishing 500 percent during previous periods. Mutuum Finance’s Presale Surge Mutuum Finance (MUTM) operates independently through its presale strategy. Mutuum Finance currently operates from phase 4 of its 11-stage presale offering its tokens for purchase at $0.025 each. Investors quickly purchase MUTM tokens during phase 4 because they anticipate price increases from $0.03 which will result in a 20% enhancement for purchasers. The established tokenomics guarantee investors can buy tokens early resulting in a 140% profit at launch. Early investors in Mutuum Finance (MUTM) can expect an enormous 9,900% return on investment because analysts predict the token value will rise to $2.50 after launch. The project team recently deployed a dashboard system to show the top 50 token holders who will receive bonus tokens when they keep their positions. Investors are experiencing increasing FOMO because phase 4 is selling out quickly at the same time that urgency drives them to buy. Security and Stability in Focus The Mutuum Finance (MUTM) development team places trust as their main strategic goal. CertiK currently performs an audit of the smart contracts which will be revealed soon through their social media platforms. The project enhancement builds trust in its lending system since it operates on decentralized principles through collateral-based loans and mtToken-based passive earnings. Steady demand occurs in Mutuum Finance through its buy-and-distribute system that protects platform revenue through payments to stakers. The organized approach makes Mutuum Finance stand out as a dependable entity in the crypto market which attracts investors who look for sustainable value instead of short-term speculative increases. Racing to the Summit The success of Dogecoin reaching the $1.25 price point depends on breaking through resistance while benefiting from Bitcoin’s market momentum yet remains vulnerable to market trends. Mutuum Finance (MUTM), however, offers a clearer trajectory. A series of positive developments including successful presale coupled with powerful token economics would be further strengthened by the upcoming CertiK audit results indicating the project’s potential for outstanding expansion. The $2.50 target of Mutuum Finance appears achievable during June thus exceeding the speculative momentum of Dogecoin. Potential investors who want to experience high transformational returns need to join Mutuum Finance’s phase 4 presale because prices will soon increase.

Chainlink ( LINK ) was trading at $14.20, where it has stalled over the past few days. This price is about 45% above its lowest level this year. Whale activity suggests that the coin may stage a strong comeback in the coming days. Santiment data shows that large investors have been accumulating LINK over the past few months. Investors holding between 100,000 and 1 million coins now own 173 million LINK, up from a low of 143 million in November last year. Their holdings have increased by 30 million coins, currently valued at approximately $420 million. Whales with between 1 million and 10 million coins have increased their holdings to 203 million from 183 million in February. Chainlink whales | Source: Santiment Additional data shows that the supply of LINK tokens on exchanges, as a percentage of total supply, has continued to decline. It has dropped from 21% in March to 19%, its lowest level since March 13. LINK supply on exchanges | Source: Santiment A drop in exchange balances is typically a bullish signal, suggesting that holders are moving tokens off exchanges and are less likely to sell. In most cases, supply increases on exchanges when holders prepare to liquidate positions. A likely catalyst for Chainlink is its partnership with major institutions like Swift and the Depository Trust & Clearing Corporation. DTCC is exploring the use of Chainlink’s Cross-Chain Interoperability Protocol to modernize mutual fund data dissemination. This is significant, as DTCC processes more than $3.7 quadrillion annually. Swift also wants to use Chainlink’s solutions to move tokenized assets by large financial services companies globally. Like DTCC, Swift Network handles over $150 trillion annually.

It’s now approaching $100,000, its highest level since late February. But fears of a recession could slow down this momentum unless the U.S. and China start talking about tariffs soon. Additionally, the mixed on-chain signals might increase volatility for the $100K level. Bitcoin’s On-chain Metrics Create Mixed Sentiment How the tariff talks go could play a big role in whether the economy heads into a recession and in where Bitcoin’s price goes next. Many experts are hoping that trade discussions in May will help calm economic worries. Still, Bitcoin might keep rising even if a recession hits. In the past 24 hours, around $34 million in Bitcoin trades were closed out. Buyers ended $8.5 million in positions, while sellers had to close $25.4 million in bets against Bitcoin.

At the same time, spot Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs saw strong inflows, with over $3.2 billion entering the market last week. BlackRock’s Bitcoin ETF alone brought in nearly $1.5 billion, its biggest weekly gain this year. Additionally, Bitcoin’s netflow is currently negative by $39.79 million, meaning more Bitcoin is being moved out of exchanges than into them. This suggests that more investors are choosing to store their Bitcoin in private wallets instead of keeping it on exchanges. It’s a sign that people are holding onto their coins, which can reduce selling pressure and support Bitcoin’s recovery. However, Bitcoin risks a “notable increase” in selling pressure around $100K. Glassnode warns that if Bitcoin’s price keeps rising, long-term holders might start selling. Their profits are now close to 350%, a level where they’ve typically sold in the past. If Bitcoin crosses $100K, it could trigger a wave of selling from these older investors. What’s Next for BTC Price? Buyers are breaking through Fib levels and they continue to hold the price above EMA trend lines. Bears are now defending any further surges above $98K as BTC faced a rejection recently. As of writing, BTC price trades at $97,182, surging over 0.7% in the last 24 hours. The rising 20-day moving average at $96,892 and a strong RSI suggest Bitcoin still has room to move higher. If it breaks above $99,500, the price could quickly jump to the key $100,000 level. Sellers will likely put up a strong fight there, but if buyers succeed, Bitcoin might climb to around $103,000.

But if it drops below, it could fall further toward the 50-day average at $92.8K.",Price Analysis|Bitcoin|Bitcoin ETF,EN,0,0,ASIA|BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|TRADING,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-05-02 17:36:12

On-chain data shows whales are aggressively accumulating DOGE following a bullish breakout above key EMAs, hinting at a major move in the making. Popular crypto analyst Ali Martinez , who has over 136,000 followers on X, revealed that whales snapped up 100 million DOGE in just one week – a staggering $15 to $18 million investment that signals rising confidence in a much bigger rally ahead. Whales have bought 100 million #Dogecoin $DOGE over the past week! pic.twitter.com/eKihSdKPXB — Ali (@ali_charts) May 1, 2025 DOGE is the dominant force in the meme coin category with a market cap of $27 billion that accounts for nearly 50% of the market value of this entire segment. Hence, Dogecoin is to meme coins what Bitcoin (BTC) is to all cryptocurrencies. Whale accumulation is typically considered a bullish signal as these deep-pocketed investors are often referred to as the ‘smart money’. Their behavior often reflects what institutional players think about the market’s outlook. Hence, this buying spree supports a bullish Dogecoin price prediction . Trading volumes in the past 24 hours have increased by nearly 20% as DOGE experienced a 1.7% uptick following the release of a positive non-farm payrolls report in the United States. Dogecoin Price Prediction: DOGE Eyes Breakout as Whales Accumulate and Bullish Signal Nears The daily chart shows that DOGE formed a textbook double bottom at $0.1400, then surged with conviction, breaking above its 21-day exponential moving average (EMA) on strong volume. Since then, price action has continued to respect this key level, with momentum indicators flashing increasingly bullish signals. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) remains above the signal line, while the MACD histogram is gaining strength once again – both suggesting upward pressure is building. DOGE now looks poised to retest the $0.2200 level and challenge its 200-day EMA – a key technical line that often determines longer-term trend direction. A bullish crossover between the 21-day and 200-day EMA would confirm a powerful buy signal. The last time this happened was in October, and DOGE went on to rally 224% within just a couple of months. With whale accumulation rising and broader sentiment improving, a run to $5 may sound ambitious, but in crypto, especially with growing DOGE adoption, anything is possible. As the market’s outlook improves, the most promising crypto presales of the year like Fantasy Pepe (FPEPE) could outperform well-established tokens like DOGE. Fantasy Pepe (FPEPE) Presale Kicks Off with Nearly $250K Raised in Just a Few Days Fantasy Pepe (FPEPE) is a fantasy football game where users can earn rewards by predicting match outcomes – all powered by an AI-driven results engine.

To read full editions, subscribe . We now know what’s been hinted at for a while: MapleStory’s crypto spinoff, MapleStory N, is finally launching on May 15. On May 8, players in select countries will be able to pre-download the game. The new game will be a 2D, sidescrolling MMORPG like the original game. MapleStory N is part of MapleStory Universe (MSU), which also includes plans for a mobile game version for players plus MapleStory N SDK and Project ModN (a blockchain game sandbox) for developers. MapleStory N uses its own Avalanche L1 (also referred to as a subnet) to facilitate player-to-player game item trading without an in-game shop. Players will be able to buy and sell in-game items and create game items, too. MapleStory N will have a built-in anticheat feature and use AvaCloud’s security infrastructure. The game has been tested with millions of onchain activities already across roughly 972,000 registered wallets. The team estimates they had about 506,000 total users during the prelaunch period. The original MapleStory game from Nexon sports a pixelated “chibi” anime aesthetic where players can choose from different character classes such as warrior, magician, bowman, thief or pirate. Players can join guilds, auction items, enhance items, level up, navigate dungeons, battle monsters and bosses, and select new skills — to name a few ways players engage with the world. But there’s a hitch with MapleStory N : It won’t be available in the US, most of Europe, or countries like Japan and South Korea. MSU’s terms put forth a long list of over 50 restricted countries — that’s 1 in 4 countries in the world. Ten months ago, some Redditors noticed this. Notably, Norway, Switzerland, Canada, Mexico, Australia, South Africa, India, and some countries in southeast Asia are not on that restricted list: That list is still the case today, though MapleStory N is apparently trying to support more regions. Being banned in the US and much of Europe could pose a significant problem for this game, because it won’t really be able to reach Western audiences, which make up a large part of the game industry’s spenders. South Korea and Japan are also important markets in gaming. In fact, MSN will not be available in the top 7 largest gaming markets globally. It will only be available in 2 of the top 10 markets by revenue (Mexico and Canada). Yes, players may try to use VPNs to get around these restrictions, but some platforms are able to identify and block VPN use. What’s strange is that other crypto games, like Off The Grid , have launched with a token and dedicated Avalanche L1 in the US without problems. MapleStory’s terms say that all of these countries are barred from playing its game because of “the status of crypto sanction or regulations in each country.” But the US, under Trump, has pivoted toward a favorable stance on cryptocurrencies overall. The SEC has also dismissed a slew of prior investigations into OpenSea, Uniswap, and others. If the MSU doesn’t change its terms, this game won’t get nearly the audience it otherwise could. I think that’s sad, because this one is promising. Get the news in your inbox. Explore Blockworks newsletters: Blockworks Daily : Unpacking crypto and the markets.

Instead, it serves a purpose that XRP cannot fulfill. His comments reflect Ripple’s broader strategy to offer both speed and stability across global finance through two distinct tools. XRP has proven valuable for fast, low-cost international payments and on-demand liquidity, often showing its superiority to Bitcoin . However, it remains a volatile digital asset, which limits its use in scenarios requiring price certainty. RLUSD solves this problem by being pegged 1:1 to the U.S. dollar and backed by real cash reserves. According to All Things XRP, “Enterprises hate volatility. They need certainty, compliance, and redeemability.” RLUSD is designed for those needs. Built for Different Use Cases While XRP facilitates rapid cross-border transfers and speculative trading, RLUSD enables more traditional financial operations. These include fiat on- and off-ramps, trading collateral, business-to-business payouts, and foreign exchange settlement. Each asset is optimized for different use cases. Trying to use one in place of the other introduces risk or inefficiency. As All Things XRP explained , they are tools for various jobs, and experts have said that RLUSD will not replace XRP . The Compliance Factor Another major distinction is regulation. RLUSD is approved by the New York Department of Financial Services (NYDFS), giving it an edge in institutional adoption. It supports strict Know Your Customer and Anti-Money Laundering mandates, requirements often essential in large-scale finance. XRP’s legal clarity following the SEC’s decision to withdraw its appeal helps its case, but All Things XRP pointed out that this victory does not equate to a regulated infrastructure like RLUSD’s. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Why XRP Cannot Do It All Some have assumed that XRP can fulfill every role within Ripple’s network. The crypto expert directly counters this: “You can’t use a volatile token to collateralize loans or remit salaries.” Even minor price swings could compromise critical financial transactions. RLUSD is designed to address those limitations by offering price stability alongside compliance. RLUSD is also not limited to the XRP Ledger (XRPL). It is deployed on Ethereum, giving it reach across multiple blockchain ecosystems. This multi-chain presence offers greater flexibility to developers, institutions, and exchanges. In contrast, XRP is native to a single chain, reducing its direct integration options outside its ecosystem. This development is not about choosing one asset over the other. As All Things XRP summarized , Ripple aligns speed, liquidity, stability, and regulatory assurance through XRP and RLUSD. He noted that both assets aren’t rivals, but complement each other.

Hive Blockchain is one of them. CryptoPotato caught up with Aydin Kilic, CEO of Hive Blockchain at Paris Blockchain Week 2025, to talk about the company’s bold expansion plans, how U.S. political shifts under Trump might reshape mining, and why Paraguay — not Texas — is where the company is putting its biggest bets. International Mining Effort and Trump’s Impact on the Market Hive has historically been known as a Canadian player. But as Kilic pointed out, the corporate center of gravity is shifting. “We recently announced that our HQ is moving from Vancouver to San Antonio, but we still have the office in Vancouver,” Kilic shared. “We’ve been listed on NASDAQ since 2021, and being domiciled in the U.S. helps us qualify for U.S. indexes. That’s important for exposure and investor positioning.” Yet despite the headline move, Kilic emphasized that their mining operations remain international. He said they’re not mining in the US, which spares them from the tariffs because they are not importing ASICs into the US. When asked about the political landscape, especially under Trump, Kilic didn’t hesitate to connect the dots between policy and mining outcomes. “Bitcoin shot up to all-time highs after Trump’s win — we saw $108,000 Bitcoin, which was phenomenal,” Kilic recalled. “There was a lot of excitement in the industry that his administration would bring in pro-Bitcoin, pro-mining policies.” One symbolic moment stood out to him: Trump’s appearance at the Nashville Bitcoin conference. “It’s the first time ever that a presidential candidate, and now a president, has spoken at the Bitcoin conference,” Kilic said. “That signaled big things.” Kilic introduced the concept of the American electro-dollar, a new framing for the U.S. dollar’s evolution. “The U.S. dollar used to be backed by gold, then it became the petrodollar, backed by oil,” he explained. “But now, with Bitcoin emerging and America as a hub for mining — backed by energy — you have the American electro-dollar. I like it. I think it’s cool.” Paraguay: Hive’s New Mining Powerhouse While the U.S. draws attention, Hive’s real operational excitement is centered in South America. “We expanded into Paraguay — 300 megawatts. Very exciting,” Kilic said with enthusiasm. “We just energized last week. We have about 1,000 machines running at 100 petahash, and we’re installing thousands more every week.” By October, Hive expects to reach about 25 Exahash, representing roughly 3% of the global Bitcoin network. What makes Paraguay so attractive? Kilic points to its renewable energy capacity. “The Itaipu Dam is a 10.4 gigawatt hydro dam, and it feeds our site,” he explained. “We have two sites: one at 100 megawatts, one at 200 megawatts, for a total of 300 megawatts of hydro energy. It’s remarkable.” But Hive’s local involvement isn’t just industrial. Kilic highlighted the company’s efforts to give back. He outlined that in the province of Cordillera, where their 100 megawatt site is located, there are 18 schools that need electricity. They’ve so far completed four of these and will be rolling more throughout 2025 and the following years – an initiative he describes as part of their sustainable model. Cracking the ASIC Hardware Challenge One of Hive’s more innovative moves has been its collaboration with Intel to produce custom ASIC miners, the BuzzMiners. “We built 10,000 BuzzMiners — a hedge so we weren’t completely reliant on the big three: Bitmain, MicroBT, and Canaan,” Kilic explained. Drawing on his background as an electrical engineer, Kilic approached the project with technical precision. “We sent our own quality assurance lead to live in the factory town for two months,” he shared. “People don’t realize — it’s not just about the chip. You need system integration: ASIC on a PCB, power supply, control circuitry, thermodynamics. Easier said than done.” Despite Intel eventually exiting the mining chip market, Hive made the project profitable. “We’ve ROI’d on two of the three batches, and the machines are still mining today,” Kilic said. “We’re sending them to Paraguay now to mine through their full lifecycle.” What’s Next: A Transformative Year Ahead Looking at the road ahead, Kilic is bullish on Hive’s near-term trajectory. He said they are aiming for 25 Exahash, which represents four times (4x) growth, which, according to him, will push the company north of $1 billion market cap by scale. He also expects the broader market to heat up once political and economic volatility settles. “All the smart industry guys are hoping for an $80 to $120 hash price. We’re at about $40 now,” Kilic said. “Historically, after a halving event, the bull market drives hash price two to three times higher. We’re excited.” Kilic plans to personally visit Paraguay multiple times over the coming months as new phases of their expansion go live. Even amid global shifts and ambitious targets, Kilic remains grounded. “I’ll always remain bullish on the U.S. as a jurisdiction to do business,” he said. “But for us right now, it’s all about Paraguay. It’s all about scale, renewable energy, and building for the future.” The post From Canada to Paraguay: Hive Blockchain’s CEO Aydin Kilic on Global Bitcoin Mining, Trump’s Policies, and the Future of the Electro-Dollar appeared first on CryptoPotato .",Crypto News|Interviews|Bitcoin Mining,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|MARKET|MINING|TRADING,"{'name': 'Crypto Potato', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopotato.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopotato,2025-05-02 17:39:34

XRP shows steady gains, but SUI and Remittix may outpace it with scalability and remittance tech driving strong momentum. Table of Contents XRP’s heating up and May could be big SUI’s speed is winning people over Remittix is going after a $250 trillion market Conclusion XRP has been looking really solid lately. After a bunch of stuff happened in the market, it’s picked up some serious momentum. It’s not exploding just yet but it’s been creeping up, around 6% up so far and it feels like May might be the month it finally pops off. But here’s the thing: while XRP is looking strong, two other coins might move even faster. We’re talking about SUI and Remittix. Both are getting attention for very different reasons. SUI’s been making noise because it’s super fast, super scalable and devs love building on it. And Remittix ? That one’s a whole different story. It’s going after the global remittance market, like $250 trillion big, with a system that makes sending money across borders way easier. Plus, its presale already hit the $14.6m mark and it’s not slowing down. You might also like: Investors rush to Remittix presale, Dogecoin and Solana could fall up to 30% in April XRP’ s heating up and May could be big XRP has been through a lot lately but it’s finally starting to pay off. The SEC just approved XRP futures ETFs , set to launch on April 30 and that’s a big deal. These ETFs let big investors get in on XRP price action without actually holding the token. That means more institutional money could flood in soon. Add in the fact that Ripple settled its SEC case in March 2025 and it’s no wonder confidence is growing. XRP rose around 5% over the last 30 days, broke out of a bullish pattern and analysts are eyeing a potential 55% jump to $3.63. Right now, it’s sitting at a $128.93B market cap and still climbing. SUI’s speed is winning people over SUI’s up 48% in the last 30 days, and it’s showing no signs of slowing down. At this rate, it’s blowing past most other coins, even XRP. It’s now trading around $3.68 with a $11.29 billion market cap and momentum just keeps building. Why all the hype? Simple, SUI’s insanely fast, super scalable and it’s easy for developers to build on. That makes it perfect for next-gen apps, especially in DeFi and gaming. Plus, the SUI network runs cheaply and smoothly even when things get busy. And yeah, SUI received 29% of Ethereum outflow in the last year, according to the crypto analyst Torero Romero. Remittix is going after a $250 trillion market For those who ever thought XRP had a good thing going with cross-border payments, Remittix might just be the glow-up version. It’s tackling the same issue, making global money transfers easy and fast, but doing it with a sharper focus on speed, simplicity and low fees. At the center of it all is Remittix’s PayFi protocol, which lets users send over 100 cryptocurrencies straight to any bank account worldwide. No middlemen. No FX fees. Just a simple 1% flat fee and faster settlements. That alone puts it miles ahead of traditional systems, and even ahead of how XRP started out. And clearly, people are paying attention. The Remittix presale has already pulled in over $14.6 million, and at a current price of just $0.0757, it’s still early. Add in up to 18% staking rewards, no transaction taxes and a BlockSAFU audit and it’s not hard to see why investors are jumping in. Conclusion XRP is heating up and SUI’s already racing ahead, but Remittix might be the one that really explodes. It’s solving a massive real-world problem with better tech and the presale is moving fast. For those who are looking for serious upside before the next bull run hits, Remittix could be a shot.

44075967,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=154703,1746207659,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Bitcoin: Warning Signs Emerge as ‘Sell in May’ Threatens Crypto Market,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/bitcoin-sell-may-warning/,"The cryptocurrency world is buzzing with optimism, especially after Bitcoin’s recent impressive run. Many traders are eyeing ambitious targets, including the much-anticipated $100,000 mark. However, as the calendar pages turn towards May, a familiar adage from traditional finance echoes through the markets: “Sell in May and go away.” This historical pattern suggests that the period from May to October can often see weaker market performance. For anyone involved in the crypto market , understanding this potential seasonal shift and its relevance to Bitcoin price action is crucial. Understanding the ‘Sell in May’ Phenomenon for Bitcoin The “Sell in May and go away” saying originates from stock market history, noting that returns during the May-October period have historically been weaker compared to the November-April period. While the crypto market is a different beast – operating 24/7 and driven by unique factors – market psychology and global trends can still influence sentiment and trading patterns. The question is: does this old-world adage hold any weight when analyzing Bitcoin historical data ? Looking back at Bitcoin’s performance in May reveals a mixed, and at times, cautionary picture: May 2021: Bitcoin experienced a significant price crash, losing a substantial portion of its value after reaching near all-time highs in April. May 2022: Another challenging month, marked by continued downward pressure as the broader crypto market entered a bear phase. Other Years: May has not always been negative. Some years have seen positive gains, while others have been relatively flat. This highlights that while a pattern *can* exist, it’s far from a guaranteed outcome. This volatility in past May performance means that while the adage serves as a warning, it’s not a strict rule for Bitcoin price movements. It’s a factor to consider within a broader analysis, not the sole basis for a trading decision. Why Caution is Rising in the Crypto Market Beyond just historical seasonality, several current factors are contributing to increased caution among investors and analysts regarding the near-term outlook for Bitcoin and the wider crypto market . Experts suggest that despite a strong start to the year (Q1), challenges may emerge, particularly heading into Q3. Key concerns include: Weak U.S. GDP Numbers: Recent economic data showing slower-than-expected growth can signal potential economic headwinds. In uncertain economic times, investors often become more risk-averse, potentially pulling back from volatile assets like cryptocurrencies. Fading Momentum: After a significant price surge, it’s natural for market momentum to slow down. This can lead to consolidation, or even pullbacks, as early buyers take profits and new buyers wait for clearer signals. Macroeconomic Uncertainty: Ongoing concerns about inflation, interest rates, and geopolitical events continue to weigh on global markets, and crypto is not immune to these broader forces. These factors, combined with the historical tendency for weaker performance in the May-October period, create a complex environment where optimism about reaching targets like $100,000 is tempered by the potential for increased volatility or downward pressure. Navigating Potential Weakness: Strategies for Crypto Investing If historical trends and current market signals suggest potential headwinds, how should those engaged in crypto investing approach the coming months? Rather than panicking or blindly selling, a strategic approach based on information and risk management is advisable. Here are some actionable insights: Don’t Solely Rely on the Adage: “Sell in May” is a historical observation, not a prophecy. Fundamental analysis, technical indicators, and current market news should form the basis of your decisions. Review Your Portfolio: Use this period of potential caution to assess your risk tolerance and portfolio allocation. Is your exposure appropriate given the potential for volatility? Consider Risk Management: Implement strategies like setting stop-loss orders to limit potential downside if the market moves against you. Avoid over-leveraging. Dollar-Cost Averaging (DCA): Instead of trying to time the market perfectly, consider using DCA. Investing a fixed amount at regular intervals can help average out your purchase price and reduce the risk of buying at a market top. Focus on Long-Term Conviction: If you believe in the long-term potential of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, short-term price fluctuations, even significant ones, may present buying opportunities rather than reasons to exit entirely. Stay Informed: Keep track of macroeconomic news, regulatory developments, and specific news related to the assets you hold. Informed decisions are the best defense against market uncertainty. Understanding Bitcoin historical data provides context, but the future is shaped by a multitude of factors. A cautious yet prepared approach to crypto investing is key. Conclusion: Balancing Optimism with Prudence in the Crypto Market The journey towards price targets like $100,000 for Bitcoin is filled with potential catalysts and exciting developments. However, the path is rarely a straight line up. The historical ‘Sell in May’ pattern, combined with current macroeconomic uncertainties and signs of fading momentum, serves as a timely reminder for caution in the crypto market . While the adage itself isn’t a guaranteed predictor for Bitcoin price , the reasons behind potential seasonal weakness and the current economic landscape warrant attention. Investors should balance their optimism with prudence, employing sound risk management and sticking to a well-thought-out investment strategy. Staying informed about Bitcoin historical data and current market conditions is essential for navigating the potential volatility that the coming months might bring.

Bitcoin’s April rally led traders to shift focus to altcoins and meme coins for higher gains. The Trump–CZ partnership boosted BNB expectations, but excitement quickly faded afterward. A wave of speculation swept through the crypto markets in March 2025, as rumors of a potential alliance between former Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao (CZ) and U.S. President Donald Trump sent shockwaves across the industry. The potential partnership has major consequences that affect the trading of cryptocurrency spaces. Bitcoin reached the $94k—$96k mark while traders turned their attention to altcoins. Similarly, the Trump–CZ collaboration became the subject of wide speculation. The altcoin market gained more momentum than Bitcoin when the cryptocurrency reached $95K in late April. During the final eight days of the month, Bitcoin experienced a modest 7% increase, but overall, it showed a 10% growth. The market surge fueled retail traders to invest aggressively in volatile meme coins and marginal investments.

This purchase follows Robinhood’s impressive earnings report for the first quarter 2025, which exceeded expectations. Ark Invest Report Shows Impressive Q1 Earnings Robinhood’s Q1 report showed a significant increase in user activity and revenue. Total revenue was almost $1 billion, making it one of the platform’s best reports. The company’s better-than-expected earnings show it is becoming more popular as the economy stabilizes and more individual investors get involved. Furthermore, the ARKK fund bought 186,812 shares of Guardant Health for $9.1 million. Similarly, the fund purchased shares in Advanced Micro Devices and 10X Genomics over the last day. Notably, Ark’s purchase indicates its belief that Robinhood will be valuable in the long run. This belief is significant as Robinhood works to expand its ways of making money beyond trading fees. Meanwhile, Ark Invest has increased its target for Bitcoin (BTC) to a staggering $ 2.4 million by 2030. The firm attributed the upgrade to a rising institutional demand confluence and BTC’s evolving role as “digital gold.” Ark Invest Poised for Crypto and Fintech Growth Cathie Wood, Ark Invest’s CEO, is known for her forward-thinking investment strategies, especially in disruptive technologies like digital assets and fintech. ARK’s recent moves highlight the firm’s adaptability in these fast-evolving sectors. The firm is strategically shifting its portfolio to capitalize on future gains as cryptocurrency price trends continue to shape the market. In April 2024, the firm added OpenAI shares to its venture fund , which was revealed to maintain diversification within its Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs). The Ark Rebalancing Strategy In another significant move, ARK sold 13,780 Coinbase shares worth about $3.9 million from its Fintech Innovation ETF (ARKF) last year. This decision comes after a 10% drop in Coinbase’s stock following hawkish remarks from the Federal Reserve. Before this, the firm offloaded $2.8 million of its spot Bitcoin ETF ARKB , marking one of the most significant sales. Ark’s strategy focuses on investing in innovative companies while spreading risk across different assets. Despite reducing its Coinbase stake, Ark still holds over $110 million shares. This shows its ongoing confidence in the company while maintaining a balanced portfolio.

Top Price Predictions Revealed,https://cryptopotato.com/ethereum-eth-set-to-rally-in-may-top-price-predictions-revealed/,"TL;DR Industry participants reminded that May has been a historically strong month for Ethereum, with some expecting a significant surge if key resistance levels are breached. ETH outflows from exchanges have increased in the last seven days, suggesting investors are moving to self-custody – often seen as a bullish sign due to reduced selling pressure. Where Next for ETH? The second-largest cryptocurrency in terms of market cap experienced a substantial pump on a 14-day scale, rising by 16% and currently trading at over $1,800. Despite the resurgence, its overall performance in the last several months remains unsatisfactory. The popular X user Carl Moon revealed to his 1.5 million followers on X that Ethereum (ETH) has been falling for five months in a row . In February, for instance, the price collapsed by nearly 32%. Carl Moon, however, pointed out that May has historically been one of the most positive periods for the asset. ETH has posted losses in only three out of ten Mays throughout its history . The ongoing month has also delivered the highest average gains over the years – around 27.31%. X user SHERIFF shared a similar thesis. They outlined that ETH bled out in seven out of the last eight months. The negative performance was also combined with low sentiment and “dead” volatility. On the other hand, these are the times when “the next big move brews,” the analyst claimed. For his part, Merlijn The Trader made an interesting comparison between Bitcoin’s performance in 2020-2021 and Ethereum’s recent structure. He predicted a potential price explosion if “history is on our side,” adding that he’s “loading ETH.” In 2020, Bitcoin consolidated at $8K… Most ignored it. Then it hit $64K. Today, Ethereum is showing the exact same structure. Accumulation. Compression. Explosion loading. I’m loading $ETH . History is on our side. pic.twitter.com/0PEtoWGNze — Merlijn The Trader (@MerlijnTrader) May 1, 2025 CRYPTOWZRD chipped in, too, projecting a potential short-term scenario. The analyst set $2,120 as the next key resistance target, envisioning “a quick move” toward $2,800 if the asset breaks through. Abandoning Exchanges One factor that supports the optimistic predictions outlined above is ETH’s exchange netflow . Outflows have dominated over inflows in the past week, signaling that investors have shifted from centralized platforms toward self-custody methods. This development is generally bullish for the price since it reduces the immediate selling pressure. ETH Exchange Netflow, Source: CryptoQuant The post Ethereum (ETH) Set to Rally in May?

Speaking to Bloomberg TV on Friday, Miran said that while he is not directly involved in negotiations, he believes President Donald Trump is committed to reaching a deal and has a strong track record in doing so. Miran referred to the 2019 “phase one” deal as evidence of the president’s ability to strike agreements despite widespread skepticism. “The president has been very clear that he thinks that there will be a deal with China,” Miran said. “And I think the president is right.” While he declined to speculate on specific figures or a potential call between the Washington and Beijing, Miran suggested that a deescalation in tariff rates is in the interest of both economies and could happen soon. “I would be surprised if tariff rates are where they are now… within a few weeks from now,” he said. Broader context and implications China’s Ministry of Commerce issued a statement earlier in the day saying it was still evaluating the trade environment. Miran emphasized that ongoing dialogue, even without formal announcements, was a positive development. After all, “talking is better than not talking,” he noted. Asked whether the U.S. might revisit purchase agreements like the one reached with China in 2020, Miran said each trading partner presents unique dynamics but that such mechanisms “should definitely be on the table.” He also acknowledged European efforts to increase purchases of U.S. goods as a potential step toward balancing trade relations, though again, he did not commit to any specific outcomes. Despite his limited role in direct negotiations, Miran repeatedly pointed to the president’s ability to create deals “nobody expects.” While specific details remain uncertain, the comments from Trump’s top economic advisor is lifting crypto and equity markets higher. Notably, Bitcoin ( BTC ) is holding the $97,000 level and seems poised to retest the $100,000 mark in the near-term after panick selling in early April sent the coin to around $75,000.

A significant development recently highlighted by Glassnode data on X has caught the attention of analysts and investors alike: Bitcoin (BTC) short-term holders who have been holding their coins for more than one month are now, on average, back in profit. This might sound like a technical detail, but it carries substantial weight for assessing potential selling pressure and the overall crypto market trend . Let’s dive into what this means and why it’s considered a potentially positive signal for the Bitcoin price . Who Are Bitcoin Short-Term Holders and Why Do They Matter? In the fascinating world of on-chain analysis, Bitcoin holders are often categorized based on how long they’ve held their coins. The two primary groups are: Long-Term Holders (LTHs): These are addresses that have held Bitcoin for 155 days or longer. They are typically considered seasoned investors with a lower time preference, less likely to sell based on short-term price volatility. Short-Term Holders (STHs): These are addresses that have held Bitcoin for less than 155 days. This group is generally more reactive to price changes, often buying during rallies and selling during dips or sideways action. Their behavior can significantly influence short-to-medium term price movements. Glassnode’s analysis specifically focuses on STHs with positions older than one month. This subset is particularly interesting because they’ve held through recent price action beyond the initial purchase FOMO (Fear Of Missing Out) or FUD (Fear, Uncertainty, Doubt) that might affect holders of just a few days or weeks. Their cost basis (the average price at which they acquired their Bitcoin) is a crucial metric. Why is their profit status important? When STHs are holding Bitcoin at a loss (their cost basis is higher than the current market price), they represent potential overhead supply. As the price rises, these holders might be incentivized to sell simply to break even or minimize losses, creating selling pressure on the market. Understanding the Glassnode Data: The Cost Basis Ribbon Glassnode data is renowned for providing deep insights into the Bitcoin network by analyzing on-chain activity. The ‘Cost Basis Ribbon’ is one of their powerful visualization tools. It displays the aggregated cost basis for different cohorts of holders, including STHs and LTHs. The recent observation is that the cost basis for STHs older than one month has moved below the current Bitcoin price . This crossing signifies that, on average, this group of Bitcoin short-term holders is now holding their coins at a profit. Think of it like this: If the average price this group paid for their BTC was $60,000, and the current price is $68,000, they are collectively sitting on unrealized gains. This fundamental shift in their position from being ‘underwater’ to ‘in the green’ is the core of the positive signal. The Significance: Reduced Selling Pressure and Market Implications The primary implication of Bitcoin short-term holders being back in profit is a potential reduction in one significant source of selling pressure. When STHs are profitable, the urgent need to sell simply to recover their initial investment diminishes. Instead of being forced sellers into rallies, they have more flexibility. They might choose to hold for further gains, or they might take profits gradually. While some profit-taking is always expected, the critical point is that the structural pressure from a large group needing to ‘get back to even’ is largely removed for this specific cohort. This shift can contribute to a more favorable environment for the Bitcoin price . With less overhead supply from this group, upward price movements might face less immediate resistance. This doesn’t guarantee a price surge, but it removes a significant hurdle. How Does This Impact the Overall Crypto Market Trend? The behavior of Bitcoin short-term holders is often seen as a barometer for market sentiment and the health of the recent uptrend. When STHs are accumulating and successfully holding into profit, it suggests a positive feedback loop where new demand is absorbing supply effectively. Historically, periods where the average STH cost basis is below the spot price have coincided with bullish phases or preceded further price appreciation. It indicates that the recent buyers are, on average, finding themselves on the right side of the market, which can encourage continued participation. This development, derived from granular Glassnode data , can be interpreted as a positive signal for the broader crypto market trend , as Bitcoin often leads the way for altcoins. Benefits and Challenges of This Development Let’s look at the potential upsides and things to be mindful of: Potential Benefits: Reduced Overhead Supply: The most direct benefit is the decrease in automatic selling pressure from a large group of recent buyers. Improved Market Sentiment: STHs being profitable can boost confidence among newer market participants. Potential for Price Momentum: With less structural resistance, the Bitcoin price has more room to potentially move upwards if demand persists. Validation of Recent Price Action: It suggests that the recent price levels are being successfully defended and are becoming a new support zone for this cohort. Potential Challenges and Considerations: Profit-Taking Still Possible: While the *need* to sell is reduced, STHs might still choose to take profits, especially if the price sees a significant spike. Not All STHs Are Equal: This is an *average*. Some individual STHs might still be at a loss depending on their exact entry point. Macro Factors: Broader economic conditions, interest rates, and global events can still impact the crypto market trend regardless of on-chain metrics. Whale Activity: Large holders (whales) can still exert significant influence on selling pressure independent of average STH behavior. This is One Metric: While valuable, this Glassnode data point should be considered alongside other on-chain indicators, technical analysis, and fundamental factors. Actionable Insights for Investors So, what should you take away from this analysis of Bitcoin short-term holders? 1. Acknowledge the Positive Signal: The reduction in structural selling pressure from this group is fundamentally bullish for the Bitcoin price outlook in the short-to-medium term. 2. Monitor STH Behavior: Keep an eye on Glassnode data or similar on-chain analytics platforms. Are these profitable STHs starting to spend their coins heavily? Increased STH spending could indicate profit-taking and renewed selling pressure. 3. Look at Long-Term Holders: What are LTHs doing? Are they accumulating or distributing? LTH behavior often provides clues about conviction in the longer-term crypto market trend . 4. Consider the Broader Context: Don’t make investment decisions based on this single data point. Evaluate macro indicators, regulatory news, and overall market sentiment. 5. Risk Management: Even with positive on-chain signals, the crypto market remains volatile. Ensure your portfolio aligns with your risk tolerance. Conclusion: A Favorable Wind, Not a Guaranteed Gale The fact that Bitcoin short-term holders (specifically those holding for over a month) are now, on average, back in profit is a significant and positive development according to Glassnode data . It materially reduces the structural selling pressure that might otherwise cap upside moves in the Bitcoin price . This shift in the on-chain landscape provides a more favorable environment for a continued positive crypto market trend . However, it’s crucial to remember that this is just one piece of the puzzle. Investors should continue to monitor other indicators and remain aware of potential headwinds. While the path forward is never certain, the current positioning of this key group of Bitcoin short-term holders offers a compelling reason for optimism regarding the potential for reduced resistance and continued upward momentum.

According to the company’s data, market dynamics currently still point to the “Bitcoin season.” The Altcoin Seasonality Index, used by Alphractal, has revealed that only a few altcoins have outperformed Bitcoin based on performance over the past 60 days. These exceptional altcoins are usually new entrants to the market. In contrast, altcoins that have been around for a long time continue to perform poorly. The Bitcoin vs. Altcoin Position Index, included in the platform’s analysis, provides a visualization of the dominant forces in the market. According to the company’s statement, orange zones indicate that Bitcoin is dominant, blue zones indicate that altcoins are gaining strength, and signal-free zones indicate that it may be the best strategy to stay away from both sides.

Will bears sell at this level? Altcoins are trading above their respective support levels, suggesting that an altcoin rally is brewing. Bitcoin’s ( BTC ) tight consolidation resolved in favor of the bulls with a break above the $95,000 barrier on May 1. The bulls are trying to push the price to the psychologically crucial level at $100,000, which may again witness a tough battle between the bulls and the bears. Veteran trader Peter Brandt sounded positive when he said in a post on X that Bitcoin could rally to the $125,000 to $150,000 range by August or September 2025 if it manages to regain its broken parabolic slope. However, Brandt cautioned that the rally could be followed by a sharp correction of more than 50%. Crypto market data daily view. Source: Coin360 As Bitcoin nears the 100,000 mark, onchain analytics firm Glassnode cautions that the long-term holders (LTHs) may be tempted to book profits . The firm said in its newsletter that the LTHs tend to book profits when their profit margin reaches 350%, and that level will be hit at $99,900. A significant amount of buy-side pressure is needed to overcome the selling to continue the up move. Could Bitcoin break above $100,000, pulling select altcoins higher? Let’s analyze the charts of the top 10 cryptocurrencies to find out. Bitcoin price prediction Bitcoin’s break above $95,000 signals an advantage to buyers, but the bears are unlikely to give up easily. BTC/USDT daily chart. Source: Cointelegraph/TradingView Sellers will try to pull the price back below $95,000, trapping the aggressive bulls. If they can pull it off, the BTC/USDT pair could test the 20-day exponential moving average ($91,391). This is a necessary support to watch out for as a solid bounce off the 20-day EMA suggests the bullish sentiment remains intact. That increases the likelihood of a break above $100,000. The pair may then reach $107,000. This optimistic view will be invalidated in the short term if the price turns down and breaks below the 20-day EMA. The pair may then tumble to the 50-day simple moving average ($86,236). Ether price prediction Buyers successfully defended Ether’s ( ETH ) drop to the 20-day EMA ($1,757) on April 30, signaling demand at lower levels. ETH/USDT daily chart. Source: Cointelegraph/TradingView The gradually upsloping 20-day EMA and the RSI in the positive territory indicate a slight edge to the bulls. If the price maintains above $1,857, the ETH/USDT pair could climb to the breakdown level of $2,111. There is minor resistance at $1,957, but that is likely to be crossed. This positive view will be invalidated in the near term if the price turns down and plunges below the moving averages. That could pull the pair down to $1,537, which is expected to attract buyers. XRP price prediction The bulls have managed to keep XRP ( XRP ) above the moving averages, but the bounce lacks strength. XRP/USDT daily chart. Source: Cointelegraph/TradingView The flattening 20-day EMA ($2.17) and the RSI just above the midpoint do not give a clear advantage either to the bulls or the bears. Buyers will seize control on a break and close above the resistance line. That clears the path for a rally to $3. On the contrary, a break and close below the moving averages could sink the XRP/USDT pair to the solid support at $2. This is a critical level to keep an eye on because a break below $2 could pull the pair to $1.61. BNB price prediction BNB ( BNB ) is witnessing a seesaw battle between the bulls and the bears at the moving averages. BNB/USDT daily chart. Source: Cointelegraph/TradingView If the price maintains below the moving averages, the BNB/USDT pair could slump to $576 and later to $566. Buyers are expected to vigorously defend the $566 level because a break below it may sink the pair to $520. The bulls will have to push the price above $620 to signal strength. The pair could then rise to $644, which is likely to act as a strong resistance. If buyers bulldoze their way through, the pair could surge to $680. Solana price prediction Solana ( SOL ) continues to face selling at the $153 level, but a positive sign is that the bulls have not ceded much ground to the bears. SOL/USDT daily chart. Source: Cointelegraph/TradingView The upsloping 20-day EMA ($142) and the RSI in the positive zone suggest that the path of least resistance is to the upside. If buyers push and maintain the price above $153, the SOL/USDT pair could rally to $180. Contrary to this assumption, if the price turns down sharply and breaks below the 20-day EMA, it suggests profit booking by the short-term bulls. The pair could then slump to the 50-day SMA ($132). Dogecoin price prediction Dogecoin ( DOGE ) rebounded off the moving averages on May 1, indicating that the bulls are trying to keep the price inside the upper half of the range. DOGE/USDT daily chart. Source: Cointelegraph/TradingView The bulls will attempt to push the price to the top of the range at $0.21, which is a critical near-term resistance level to watch out for. If buyers pierce the $0.21 level, the DOGE/USDT pair will complete a double-bottom pattern. That could start a move to $0.25 and then to the pattern target of $0.28. Contrarily, a break and close below the moving averages opens the doors for a fall to the support of the range at $0.14. Buyers are expected to defend the $0.14 level with all their might because a break below it may sink the pair to $0.10. Cardano price prediction Buyers bought the dip to the moving averages in Cardano ( ADA ), but the failure to build upon the rebound suggests a lack of demand at higher levels. ADA/USDT daily chart. Source: Cointelegraph/TradingView Buyers will have to drive the price above the $0.75 resistance to gain the upper hand. If they do that, the ADA/USDT pair could rally to $0.83. Sellers will try to halt the up move at $0.83, but if the bulls prevail, the pair could reach $1. On the downside, a break and close below the moving averages tilts the short-term advantage in favor of the bears. The pair could slide to $0.58, where the buyers are expected to step in. Related: Moon soon? XRP's strongest spot premium aligns with 70% rally setup Sui price prediction Buyers pushed Sui ( SUI ) toward the $3.90 overhead resistance on May 1, but the long wick on the candlestick shows that bears are aggressively defending the level. SUI/USDT daily chart. Source: Cointelegraph/TradingView The first support on the downside is $3.27, and then the 20-day EMA ($3.01). If the price rebounds off the 20-day EMA with strength, the bulls will again try to drive the SUI/USDT pair above $3.90. If they manage to do that, the pair could rally to $4.25 and subsequently to $5. Instead, if the price breaks below the 20-day EMA, it suggests that the bulls have given up. The pair may slump to the solid support at $2.86. If the price rebounds off the $2.86 support, the pair may form a range. Chainlink price prediction Chainlink ( LINK ) turned up from the moving averages on May 1, indicating that the sentiment remains positive. LINK/USDT daily chart. Source: Cointelegraph/TradingView Buyers will try to push the price above the $16 overhead resistance and challenge the resistance line of the descending channel pattern. Sellers are expected to fiercely defend the resistance line because a break and close above it signals a potential trend change. If the price turns down from the overhead resistance and breaks below the moving averages, it suggests selling on rallies. The LINK/USDT pair may drop to $11.68, extending its stay inside the channel for some more time.

Source: Cointelegraph/TradingView Buyers will try to propel the price above the $23.50 overhead resistance. If they manage to do that, the AVAX/USDT pair will complete a double-bottom pattern. That may start an up move to $28.78 and later to the pattern target of $31.73. The moving averages are the crucial support to watch out for. If the price turns down from the current level or the overhead resistance and breaks below the 50-day SMA ($19.79), it suggests that the range-bound action may continue for a few more days.

Investors were recruited through seminars and promised returns as high as 9% on municipal infrastructure-related products. Much of the money was lost in areas including P2P lending, crypto trading, stock speculation, and promissory notes. JYS Group, a Chinese investment firm based in Guangdong province, collapsed in mid-April after raising an estimated ¥1.34 billion (approximately $180 million) for “high-return” schemes , including crypto. According to a May 2 report by The Economic Observer, the company’s chairman, Lin Chunhao, announced his departure from China via a WeChat group, stating that he had arrived in the UK following failed investments. Lin’s Escape Sparks Criminal Probe “By the time you read this, I am already on British soil,” he wrote. Lin claimed personal losses exceeding $96 million and said all funds had been spent on interest payments, salaries, and operating costs. JYS marketed its offerings by targeting retail investors through financial literacy seminars. Participants were offered high-yield products with annualized returns of 6% to 9% and maturity periods ranging from three to 36 months. Some were introduced to the schemes through family connections. The fund was raised from retail investors across several cities, including Shenzhen, Guangzhou, Foshan, and Zhongshan. The products were managed by Shenzhen Haiboxin Project Management Co., Ltd., which promoted itself as affiliated with state-owned firms. Investigations later revealed shared offices and personnel with JYS, casting doubt on its claims of independence. Offices in Shenzhen and Zhongshan were found shuttered, and local authorities have begun investigations. The Shenzhen Public Security Bureau’s Economic Crime Investigation Division is leading the inquiry. Crypto Promises Masked Mounting Losses Some investors increased their exposure to JYS Group under pressure from sales agents, with some people committing over $80,000. The company collapsed within two months of these investments. By the time investors realized the risks, many of the agents who had encouraged their participation could no longer be reached. While investors were initially told their funds were backing municipal infrastructure projects, such as roads and tunnels, Lin provided no evidence to support these claims in his final statement. Lin’s farewell message referenced failed ventures but did not mention any specific infrastructure assets in China . Instead, it listed a string of unsuccessful investments across sectors, including peer-to-peer lending, crypto trading, and stock speculation. According to a financial breakdown shared in the message, losses spanned multiple areas: nearly $10 million each from bad debts, failed crypto trades, and promissory note defaults. Beijing has released a multi-agency action plan to integrate blockchain across sectors like AI, finance, and healthcare by 2027. #AI #blockchain #china https://t.co/MRhusQySs3 — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) April 29, 2025 The collapse of JYS Group points to a broader vulnerability in the investment sector, where financial products like crypto that are marketed as secure and high-yield often operate with little oversight. Despite repeated warnings from regulators, schemes continue to attract middle-class investors drawn by promises of above-market returns. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs): How are firms like JYS able to operate without regulatory checks? Quasi-financial entities often operate in grey areas under the guise of “project management” or education services, avoiding immediate scrutiny unless complaints or collapses trigger investigations. What should investors look out for to avoid similar schemes? Red flags include high promised returns, pressure from sales agents, and a lack of independent third-party auditing. Regulatory registration alone isn’t sufficient proof of legitimacy. What happens to investors when perpetrators flee abroad? Cross-border recovery is notoriously difficult. Unless formal extradition treaties and asset recovery channels are in place, investors often face years of legal limbo with little prospect of compensation.

In an April 28 letter to White House crypto czar David Sacks , the group urged President Donald Trump “to take immediate action to discontinue the Biden-era Department of Justice's lawless campaign to criminalize open-source software development.” The letter specifically mentioned the prosecution of Storm, who was charged in August 2023 with helping launder over $1 billion in crypto through Tornado Cash. His trial is still set for July , and his fellow charged co-founder, Roman Semenov, is at large and believed to be in Russia. The DeFi Education Fund said that in Storm’s case, the Department of Justice is attempting to hold software developers criminally liable for how others use their code, which is “not only absurd in principle, but it sets a precedent that potentially chills all crypto development in the United States.” The group also called for the recognition that the prosecution contradicts the Treasury Department’s Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) guidance from Trump’s first term, which established that developers of self-custodial, peer-to-peer protocols are not money transmitters. Source: DeFi Education Fund “This kind of legal environment does not just chill innovation — it freezes it,” they argued. The letter added that it also “empowers politically-motivated enforcement and puts every open-source developer at risk, regardless of industry.” In January, a federal court in Texas ruled that the Treasury overstepped its authority by sanctioning Tornado Cash.

According to a Bloomberg report citing sources familiar with the matter, the banking giant plans to allow customers to buy and sell cryptocurrencies starting next year, capitalizing on the recent deregulation efforts spearheaded by President Donald Trump. E*Trade To Allow Direct Crypto Investments This initiative marks a pivotal moment for Morgan Stanley as it seeks to enhance its offerings in the financial landscape. The firm is reportedly considering partnerships with established digital asset companies to develop the necessary infrastructure for trading virtual assets. ETrade, which was acquired by Morgan Stanley in 2020 for $13 billion, currently serves over 5 million users. While the platform has provided access to Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) through exchange-traded funds (ETFs), direct investment in these digital currencies has not yet been available. The anticipated move to allow direct digital asset trading would position ETrade competitively against popular platforms such as Robinhood and Coinbase, which have already established strong footholds in the market, especially in the US. Traditional Finance’s Shift Towards Digital Assets The timing of Morgan Stanley’s announcement is particularly noteworthy, coinciding with a Federal Reserve (Fed) decision to rescind previous guidance that cautioned banks against engaging with cryptocurrencies. This shift signals a potential opening for financial institutions to explore innovative avenues in the crypto space, aligning with Trump’s pro-crypto stance. The president has made it clear that he aims to position the United States as “the crypto capital of the world,” reversing many of the regulatory measures that were implemented under the Biden Administration. Donald Trump’s second administration in the White House has also taken steps to establish a national Bitcoin and digital asset reserve and support the development of a clear regulatory framework for the evolving industry. The momentum in the traditional finance sector towards digital assets is growing. Notably, Fidelity Investments announced in March that it had begun testing its own stablecoin, while Bank of America’s CEO Brian Moynihan expressed interest in entering the stablecoin market pending the establishment of a regulatory framework. At the time of writing, the total crypto market capitalization is approaching $3 trillion for the first time in nearly two months. As such, the market’s leading crypto, BTC, has once again surged close to the $100,000 mark, currently trading at $96,865. This demonstrates not only the renewed interest in risk assets from institutions such as Morgan Stanley but also a broader sense of bullishness among retail investors who expect new record highs for the cryptocurrency this quarter.

44076603,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=154701,1746208823,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,US Nonfarm Payrolls Surge: What This Economic Data Means for Crypto Investors,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/us-nonfarm-payrolls-impact/,"Hey crypto enthusiasts! While our focus is often on Bitcoin charts and altcoin movements, understanding the broader economic landscape is crucial. Why? Because macroeconomic indicators, like the latest US Nonfarm Payrolls report, can significantly influence traditional financial markets, which in turn, often ripple into the volatile world of cryptocurrency. What the Latest US Nonfarm Payrolls Report Revealed The April US Nonfarm Payrolls report dropped, and it certainly turned heads. According to data compiled by Investing.com from the U.S. Department of Labor, the American economy added a robust 177,000 jobs last month. This figure wasn’t just good; it handily beat the market’s consensus forecast, which was anticipating a gain of around 138,000 jobs. Here’s a quick look at the key numbers: Actual Nonfarm Payrolls Added: 177,000 Market Forecast: 138,000 Difference: +39,000 (a significant beat) This stronger-than-expected job creation suggests continued underlying strength in the American economy. More jobs mean more people earning income, potentially leading to increased consumer spending – a key driver of economic growth. Analyzing the Unemployment Rate : Stability Amidst Growth While the job *creation* number stole the headlines by exceeding expectations, the Unemployment Rate told a story of stability. The rate for April came in at 4.2%, precisely aligning with what forecasters had predicted. What does this 4.2% Unemployment Rate tell us? It indicates that the percentage of the labor force that is actively seeking employment but unable to find it remains relatively low. Aligning with forecasts suggests the labor market isn’t tightening dramatically or loosening unexpectedly, at least from this specific metric’s perspective. Combined with strong job creation, it paints a picture of a healthy, albeit perhaps gradually cooling, labor market compared to the intense tightness seen in previous periods. Understanding the Broader US Labor Market Landscape Looking beyond just the headline numbers, the US Labor Market is a complex picture. Factors like wage growth, labor force participation, and the types of jobs being added all contribute to the overall health assessment. While the initial report focuses on payrolls and unemployment, economists delve deeper into these underlying metrics to understand inflationary pressures and economic momentum. A strong US Labor Market is generally a positive sign for the economy, but it can also have implications for inflation. When employers compete for workers, wages tend to rise. While good for workers, rapid wage growth can contribute to inflationary pressures, which is a major concern for central banks like the Federal Reserve. Why This Economic Data Impacts Financial Markets So, why does this specific piece of Economic Data matter so much to Financial Markets , including stocks, bonds, and yes, crypto? It boils down to monetary policy expectations. The Federal Reserve watches labor market data very closely, along with inflation figures, when making decisions about interest rates. Stronger-than-expected job growth (like the 177K figure) can be interpreted as a sign that the economy is robust. A robust economy *might* give the Fed more room to keep interest rates higher for longer, or delay potential rate cuts, to combat inflation. Conversely, weaker labor data might signal economic slowing, potentially prompting the Fed to consider rate cuts sooner to stimulate growth. Because interest rates influence borrowing costs, investment decisions, and the attractiveness of different asset classes, shifts in expectations can cause significant market movements. Connecting the Dots: Implications for Cryptocurrency Now, let’s bring it back to crypto. How does a US jobs report affect Bitcoin or Ethereum? Here’s the connection: Risk Sentiment: Cryptocurrencies are generally considered risk assets. When the economic outlook is strong (potentially supported by strong labor data) but also suggests higher interest rates might persist, it can sometimes reduce investor appetite for riskier assets compared to safer, yield-bearing options like bonds. Liquidity: The Fed’s monetary policy affects overall market liquidity. Higher rates or quantitative tightening can reduce the amount of money flowing through the financial system, which can impact asset prices across the board, including crypto. Correlation: While crypto aims to be a separate asset class, it has shown increasing correlation with traditional financial markets, particularly tech stocks. If strong economic data leads to a sell-off in tech stocks due to rate hike fears, crypto often follows suit, at least in the short term. Therefore, while the US Nonfarm Payrolls report doesn’t directly measure crypto activity, it’s a vital piece of the macroeconomic puzzle that influences the broader financial environment in which crypto operates.

This initial rejection follows a brief rally in the last week of April, which, interestingly, saw it break above a downward-sloping resistance trendline that has defined its structure since early January 2025. However, the rejection has since been followed by a retest of this trendline, but this pullback is seen as a setup for a potential breakout to levels above $4 rather than an outright rejection. Trendline Breakout In Focus With Swing Failure Pattern According to a technical analysis on the TradingView platform, XRP/USDT is now pressing against the zone of a significant descending trendline on the daily candlestick timeframe chart. This trendline, which has guided the broader bearish structure since January 2025, was previously responsible for notable price rejections in February and March. However, the most recent interaction with this trendline appears different, and XRP may be shifting from a pattern of lower highs to a breakout and retest formation. Related Reading: Has The Dogecoin Price Already Topped? Indicator That Predicted Previous Tops Show When The notable development here is the sequence leading to the breakout attempt. XRP first surged upward in late April and moved above the trendline. But instead of collapsing back into the previous range, the price briefly retraced and formed a higher low, which is an important structural change in the bullish version of a swing failure pattern (SFP). In this case, the failed low formed after the breakout hints at a reversal of the prior downtrend, and this reversal was validated when XRP closed on April 30. As shown in the chart below, this swing failure pattern has now flipped bullish with volume rising, an early sign of a rebound and rally. Adding to this outlook, the trendline has been touched multiple times over the past five months, making a confirmed close above it very important. The white arrow drawn on the chart indicates the anticipated direction of the XRP price if the bounce is sustained. $3.00 Resistance Is Important For Next Price Explosion A bullish daily close above this trendline would break the bearish structure that has defined XRP’s price since the start of the year. If successful, this would open the XRP price to an eventual run above $4 if everything goes right.

A daily close above this round psychological level, combined with a volume spike, could open the way for XRP to surge toward the next key zones. These zones include $3.31, which coincides with the high on January 16, which is the next clear liquidity level. The next zone would be around its current all-time high. Beyond that, $4.6209 is the next longer-term breakout target. At the time of writing, XRP is trading at $2.20.

But is this bullish pressure sustainable, or a sign of overheating? Bitcoin’s ( BTC ) current price movement is testing a key area of resistance following a powerful rally, largely driven by a short squeeze. Now hovering just below $98,000, BTC is encountering strong supply at the confluence of the descending trendline, the 0.618 Fibonacci level, and the point of control from previous trading ranges. At the same time, funding rates across major exchanges have turned positive, creating an important dynamic between derivatives and spot price action. Key technical points Current Price: Bitcoin trades near $96,250 –$97,800, facing multiple resistance confluences. Funding Rates: Positive across major exchanges, reflecting increased long positions in perpetual futures. Price Structure: The short squeeze has lifted BTC into a range with previous bearish order blocks. To better understand how this affects price action, it’s important to know what funding rates are. In perpetual futures markets, used heavily in crypto,funding is a periodic payment made between traders based on the difference between the futures and spot price. When funding is positive, long traders pay short traders, which typically occurs when bullish sentiment dominates. When funding is negative, short traders pay longs, signaling bearish sentiment or aggressive shorting. Bitcoin Exchange Funding Rate Source: CryptoQuant Right now, Bitcoin’s positive funding rate suggests that traders are paying a premium to hold long positions. This often happens after a rapid rise, such as a short squeeze, when the majority of traders flip long expecting continuation. However, this can also set the stage for pullbacks if the market becomes overleveraged. If funding remains elevated without strong spot demand or volume, it raises the probability of a shakeout or local top.

It combines multiple macro-level resistance factors with a psychological milestone following a sudden squeeze. If BTC is able to consolidate above this area with volume and hold the breakout, the positive funding may fuel a continuation to $100,000 and beyond. However, failure to hold this level could trigger a rapid unwind of leveraged longs, reversing gains quickly. Bitcoin’s funding rates remain a key metric to watch. As long as BTC consolidates above $96,200 with healthy volume, continuation is possible, but if positive funding persists without a breakout, a flush lower becomes more probable. Caution is warranted while BTC tests this pivotal level.

In a new strategy session, Santiment says altcoins will likely continue to trend higher if Bitcoin ( BTC ) does not return to the $80,000 range and if possible, exchange-traded funds (ETFs) for alts continue to generate excitement. “As we kick off May trading, stay alert to quickly evolving narratives – particularly if Bitcoin holds its position, and profits continue redistributing to various projects based on the latest news breaks. The altcoin rally may have legs if ETF hype continues, and if Bitcoin can stay strong above $90,000.” Specifically, Santiment notes there is investor enthusiasm around the possible launch of spot market ETFs for payments token XRP , Ethereum ( ETH ) rival Solana ( SOL ) and memecoin Dogecoin ( DOGE ). “Many believe that, once approved, these ETFs could bring in large amounts of institutional money and push XRP into the financial mainstream… There’s also been mentions of Solana’s potential spot ETF approval, bullish market sentiment and its ranking among top cryptocurrencies, making it a focal point in crypto market discussions… With Dogecoin now among the top 10 most traded coins and one of the largest by market cap, the idea of a DOGE ETF is gaining traction. The partnership between 21Shares and the Dogecoin Foundation (via the House of Doge) to promote the ETF has added credibility to the project, sparking stronger engagement from both longtime DOGE supporters and traditional investors looking for new opportunities. Because of these developments, crowd sentiment toward Dogecoin has clearly shifted.” But Santiment warns retail traders could suddenly cause the market to plummet based on sentiment alone. “However, retail euphoria often leads to sharp corrections, especially when memecoins are dominating attention. In a market driven by emotions as much as fundamentals, sentiment remains one of the most telling indicators of what’s to come.” Follow us on X , Facebook and Telegram Don't Miss a Beat – Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox Check Price Action Surf The Daily Hodl Mix Disclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

In a post on X, Brett wrote, “SWIFT DOWN — AGAIN?! Banks stuck, wires jammed… but XRP doesn’t blink. While the world waits, Ripple delivers. The future of finance isn’t coming — it’s already here.” His post came in response to a SWIFT update dated May 2, 2024, which outlined technical disruptions in the system’s billing and accounts receivable operations. SWIFT DOWN — AGAIN?! Banks stuck, wires jammed… but #XRP doesn’t blink. While the world waits, #Ripple delivers. The future of finance isn’t coming — it’s already here. pic.twitter.com/cunhtDLIfa — Brett (@Brett_Crypto_X) May 2, 2025 Minnesota Government Reports Technical Failures The bulletin issued by the state of Minnesota described a surge in problems tied to manual processing functions in SWIFT, specifically with the Single Action Invoice (SAIP) and ARUpdate modules. These modules handle payments and invoice reruns across various financial departments. The agency reported that manually rerunning SAIP or ARUpdate can lead to failures in the process instance, causing delays and interrupting batch schedules. The update urged users to avoid unnecessary manual interventions, as they increase the likelihood of systemic errors. The notice emphasized that these processes are designed to operate automatically, pointing out that the system could be destabilized when triggered manually. XRP Advocates Compare Performance Following the announcement, supporters of blockchain-based financial solutions, particularly XRP, took to social media to contrast the speed and resilience of decentralized systems against legacy infrastructure. An X user, Luka Grunt, commented , “XRP’s holding strong while traditional systems struggle. Ripple’s making big moves, and the future of finance feels closer than ever!” Another user added , “Meanwhile… XRP MOVES IN SECONDS. Ripple isn’t the future — it’s the present. The old world’s crumbling. The new one runs on XRP.” These remarks reflect a broader dissatisfaction among crypto advocates, who increasingly view conventional systems as outdated and inefficient. For many in the XRP community, these recurring issues validate the need to transition to blockchain-powered solutions prioritizing speed, stability, and automation. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Ripple Positioned as Modern Infrastructure Ripple, the enterprise blockchain company that utilizes XRP for cross-border settlements , continues to position itself as a solution to the problems highlighted by the recent SWIFT malfunction. Unlike SWIFT, which relies on intermediary banks and manual inputs, RippleNet offers nearly real-time settlement across borders with minimal friction. The technical issues reported in the SWIFT update gave XRP proponents an avenue to emphasize the benefits of decentralized infrastructure. With increasing reliance on digital finance and growing dissatisfaction with traditional systems, the conversation around institutional blockchain adoption is gaining renewed urgency. Legacy Systems Under Scrutiny While the implications of this latest SWIFT failure remain localized, the broader narrative is becoming clearer. Failures in legacy financial infrastructure, particularly those that impact efficiency and reliability, are increasingly seen as openings for blockchain-based technologies to demonstrate their strengths. Whether institutions will take immediate action to explore alternatives is uncertain. However, the community surrounding Ripple and XRP continues to use these moments to call for faster modernization of the global financial system.

44076901,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=154700,1746209416,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Airbnb AI Makes Breakthrough in Customer Service with US Bot Rollout,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/airbnb-ai-bot-launches/,"In the fast-evolving world of technology, where AI is making waves across industries, major platforms are beginning to integrate artificial intelligence into their core operations. For those following the intersection of tech and platforms like Airbnb, the news of their quiet rollout of an Airbnb AI customer service bot in the U.S. is particularly interesting. This move signals a significant step for the company and highlights the increasing practical applications of AI in consumer-facing services. Airbnb AI: A Quiet Rollout and Immediate Impact Airbnb has begun deploying an AI-powered customer service bot across the United States. According to CEO Brian Chesky during the company’s first-quarter conference call, this rollout started last month. The adoption has been rapid, with approximately 50% of Airbnb’s U.S. users already interacting with the AI bot for their customer service needs. The company plans to make this feature available to all U.S. users within the current month, demonstrating confidence in its performance and stability. Improving AI Customer Service Efficiency The immediate benefits of the AI customer service bot are already becoming apparent. Brian Chesky noted that the AI is making the customer experience easier. Crucially, it has led to a reported 15% reduction in the number of users needing to contact a live human agent for support. This efficiency gain is a key objective for many companies implementing AI in customer support, aiming to handle routine queries quickly and free up human agents for more complex issues. This aligns with the potential that Airbnb co-founder Nathan Blecharczyk spoke about last year when discussing testing the technology for specific queries. Comparing Airbnb’s Approach to Travel AI Competitors Airbnb appears to be taking a more measured approach to implementing Travel AI compared to some of its major competitors. While companies like Expedia and Booking.com are heavily investing in and launching broader AI features, such as building detailed itineraries, comprehensive trip planning tools, and providing real-time travel updates, Airbnb is focusing its initial large-scale AI deployment specifically on customer service. Chesky has previously indicated that he believes AI is still in its early stages and that customer service is a logical starting point before exploring applications like travel planning or booking. The Broader Trend of AI in Travel Airbnb’s move is part of a larger trend of integrating AI in travel services. The travel industry involves complex logistics, vast amounts of data, and diverse customer needs, making it a fertile ground for AI applications. Beyond customer service, AI is being used for personalized recommendations, dynamic pricing, fraud detection, operational efficiency, and even creating bespoke travel experiences. While Airbnb starts with customer support, their executives acknowledge the potential for AI to change the consumer experience over time, suggesting future expansions into other areas of the travel journey. What This Means for Airbnb Technology and Future The successful rollout and initial impact of the AI customer service bot underscore the potential of Airbnb technology to leverage AI for operational improvements and user experience enhancements. This focus on efficiency comes at a time when the company reported $2.27 billion in revenue for the first quarter, a 6% increase year-over-year. However, they also forecast current-quarter revenue slightly below analyst expectations, anticipating a potential slowdown in travel demand influenced by factors like global economic sentiment. Implementing AI for customer service could be a strategic move to maintain efficiency and service quality even during potential shifts in demand, paving the way for future AI integrations as the technology matures. In conclusion, Airbnb’s quiet but impactful rollout of its AI customer service bot in the U.S. marks a significant step in its technological evolution. By focusing on customer support first, they are demonstrating a cautious yet effective strategy for AI adoption, already yielding positive results in reducing the need for human intervention. This development is a key indicator of how major platforms are embracing AI, setting the stage for further innovation within the travel industry and beyond.
