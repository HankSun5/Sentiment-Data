This isn’t science fiction; it’s a real proposal put forward by U.S. Congressman Lance Gooden. This move signals a growing push for integrating cryptocurrencies into more mainstream, and even official, spaces, potentially accelerating Cryptocurrency Adoption in the United States. Why Put Crypto ATMs in Government Spaces? Texas Representative Lance Gooden has formally urged the General Services Administration (GSA), the agency responsible for managing federal properties, to seriously consider the installation of Crypto ATMs within federal buildings. His rationale extends beyond mere convenience. The proposal aligns with a broader, more positive stance towards digital assets advocated by figures like former President Trump, suggesting a political undercurrent to this technological push. Gooden’s argument centers on several key benefits: Innovation Showcase: Placing crypto ATMs could demonstrate the U.S. government’s willingness to embrace financial technology innovation and Blockchain Technology . Identity Verification: Reputable crypto ATM operators often incorporate robust Know Your Customer (KYC) and Anti-Money Laundering (AML) protocols, potentially offering a secure method for transactions with verified identities. Transaction Transparency: While often perceived as anonymous, blockchain transactions are inherently transparent on the public ledger, offering a traceable record for regulatory purposes. This proposal aims to normalize the use of digital assets by making them accessible in familiar, official locations, potentially fostering greater trust and encouraging wider Cryptocurrency Adoption among the general public. Navigating the Waters of US Crypto Regulation While the vision of accessible crypto in federal buildings is compelling, the reality is complex, especially concerning US Crypto Regulation . The cryptocurrency landscape in the U.S. is currently fragmented, with various federal and state agencies asserting jurisdiction. The regulatory environment for Crypto ATMs specifically has been a point of concern. CoinDesk reported that Gooden’s proposal comes amid ongoing discussions and concerns regarding crypto ATM-related fraud and their potential use in illicit activities. Regulatory bodies like the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) classify crypto ATM operators as money transmitters, subjecting them to specific registration, reporting, and compliance requirements. However, enforcement and oversight remain challenging. Key regulatory hurdles include: Ensuring consistent and effective KYC/AML compliance across potentially thousands of machines. Addressing the risk of scams where users are directed to deposit money into crypto ATMs. Clarifying which specific digital assets would be supported and their regulatory status (e.g., securities vs. commodities). Integrating these operations with existing federal building security and financial protocols. Any implementation would require close coordination between the GSA, FinCEN, the SEC, the CFTC, and potentially state regulators, highlighting the intricate nature of US Crypto Regulation . Understanding Blockchain Technology and Crypto ATMs At its core, a Crypto ATM is a kiosk that allows individuals to exchange cash or debit card funds for cryptocurrency, or vice versa, facilitating interaction with Blockchain Technology . Unlike traditional bank ATMs that connect to your bank account, crypto ATMs connect to cryptocurrency exchanges or wallets to perform transactions on the blockchain network. Here’s a simplified look at how they generally work: User Interaction: The user selects the cryptocurrency they want to buy or sell. Identity Verification: For compliance, the ATM typically requires identity verification, often via a phone number, ID scan, or even biometrics for larger transactions. Transaction: Buying Crypto: The user inserts cash or uses a debit card. The ATM sends the crypto to the user’s digital wallet address (often provided via a QR code scan). Selling Crypto: The user sends crypto from their wallet to the ATM’s address. Once confirmed on the blockchain, the ATM dispenses cash. Blockchain Confirmation: The transaction is processed and confirmed on the respective blockchain ledger, leveraging the decentralized and transparent nature of Blockchain Technology . The global network of Crypto ATMs has grown significantly, providing a physical touchpoint for accessing the digital asset space. Placing them in highly visible federal buildings could significantly boost public awareness and interaction with this technology. Potential Impact on Cryptocurrency Adoption Introducing Crypto ATMs into federal buildings could have a substantial, albeit perhaps symbolic, impact on Cryptocurrency Adoption . Federal buildings are perceived as secure, official, and accessible public spaces. Seeing crypto services offered there could lend an air of legitimacy to digital assets for many who remain skeptical or unfamiliar. Consider the potential ripple effects: Increased Visibility: Exposure to cryptocurrency beyond online platforms or niche retail locations. Perceived Legitimacy: Association with government buildings might reduce public fear of scams or illegitimacy. Accessibility: Providing a physical, potentially easier on-ramp for individuals less comfortable with online exchanges. Educational Opportunity: While not explicitly educational kiosks, their presence could spark curiosity and encourage learning about crypto and Blockchain Technology . However, the actual impact on widespread adoption would depend heavily on the number of machines installed, their functionality, transaction limits, fees, and the public’s reaction. It’s a step that could either be a catalyst for broader acceptance or remain a niche service within government facilities. Challenges and Criticisms Despite the potential benefits, the proposal faces significant challenges and attracts criticism. Beyond the regulatory hurdles mentioned earlier, practical and security concerns abound. Security Risks: Federal buildings have stringent security protocols. Integrating third-party kiosks, especially those handling financial transactions involving volatile assets, adds layers of complexity. Physical security of the machines themselves is also a factor. Cost and Maintenance: Who bears the cost of installation, maintenance, security, and compliance for these machines? The GSA or the private operators? Public Perception: While some may see this as innovation, others might view it skeptically, associating crypto with risks or illicit activities, potentially drawing negative attention to federal facilities. Limited Scope: Crypto ATMs typically offer basic buy/sell functions for a limited number of cryptocurrencies. They don’t represent the full spectrum of digital asset use cases (DeFi, NFTs, etc.). Regulatory Uncertainty: The evolving nature of US Crypto Regulation means that rules governing these machines could change, impacting their operation or legality within federal spaces. Critics might argue that federal buildings are not appropriate venues for commercial financial services, especially those as volatile and regulation-sensitive as cryptocurrency. They might suggest that promoting Cryptocurrency Adoption is not a core function of the GSA. What Happens Next? Representative Gooden’s proposal is currently a request to the General Services Administration. The GSA would need to evaluate the feasibility, security implications, costs, and alignment with federal policy and US Crypto Regulation . This process could involve studies, consultations with other government agencies, and potentially pilot programs. The political dimension is also noteworthy. Aligning the proposal with a pro-crypto stance from a former president suggests it could become a talking point in broader political discussions about technology and finance. The outcome will likely depend on the GSA’s assessment, the evolving regulatory landscape, and the political will to push such an initiative forward. This proposal serves as a tangible example of how proponents of digital assets are actively seeking ways to integrate them into the physical and institutional fabric of the country, pushing the boundaries of where and how we interact with Blockchain Technology . Conclusion: A Step Towards Mainstream? The proposal to install Crypto ATMs in Federal Buildings is a bold statement about the potential future of finance and Cryptocurrency Adoption in the United States. It highlights the increasing desire to bridge the gap between traditional financial systems and the burgeoning world of digital assets powered by Blockchain Technology . While the stated benefits of innovation, identity verification, and transparency are compelling, the path is fraught with challenges, particularly concerning the complex landscape of US Crypto Regulation and security concerns. Whether this proposal comes to fruition remains to be seen. However, it undeniably pushes the conversation forward regarding the role of cryptocurrencies in public spaces and within official government perception. It’s a move that could, if successful, significantly normalize digital asset use, or, if unsuccessful, underscore the significant hurdles still facing widespread integration.

The total crypto market capitalization rose 8.5% since March. Cryptocurrency traders have frequently zoomed in on the need for crypto to show a clear “ decoupling ” from the stock market, and over the past 10 days, the intraday movements of Bitcoin ( BTC ) and major altcoins have closely tracked those of the S&P 500, even as trade war developments have dominated market sentiment. S&P 500 futures (left) vs. Total crypto cap, USD (right). Source: TradingView/Cointelegraph A decoupling would validate digital assets as an independent class and address growing concerns about a potential global economic recession. This ongoing correlation has led market participants to question whether the cryptocurrency market is destined to follow the stock market’s lead indefinitely, and what conditions would be necessary for a genuine decoupling to occur. Stock market shows strength despite trade tensions The S&P 500 reached its peak on Feb. 19 and has since struggled to reclaim the 5,800 level, a support that had held for four months. Despite persistent pressure from US trade disputes with Canada and Mexico, as well as the imposition of new tariffs affecting nearly every major economic region, equities have demonstrated notable resilience. Chinese state media recently reported that the United States has quietly initiated trade negotiations. Although China officially maintains a 125% retaliatory tariff on US imports, it has granted waivers for sectors such as ethane, semiconductors, and certain pharmaceuticals. The United States, in turn, has partially exempted automakers from new tariffs. These actions suggest that both sides are gradually making concessions. There is a reasonable possibility that the S&P 500 established a bottom at 4,835 on April 7, with further gains from the current 5,635 level remaining plausible. The stock market has responded positively to robust first-quarter earnings, as companies adapt to tariffs by relocating production outside China or expanding operations within the United States. For instance, Microsoft reported a 13.2% year-over-year increase in revenue, with higher margins and strong demand for artificial intelligence. Meta also delivered earnings and revenue that exceeded market expectations on April 30. These results have alleviated concerns about a potential AI bubble or the risk that the trade war could force companies to reduce investment. The market’s focus shifts to the Federal Reserve Rather than concentrating on the recent decline in US PMI manufacturing data-which reached a five-month low in April, market participants are closely monitoring the Federal Reserve’s next policy moves. Following a year of balance sheet reduction, the Fed is now considering asset purchases to help ease selling pressure. An increase in liquidity is typically favorable for risk-oriented assets. Therefore, even if a full decoupling does not occur, cryptocurrencies could still benefit from a more supportive macroeconomic environment. S&P 500 futures (left) vs. Total crypto cap, USD (right). Source: TradingView/Cointelegraph Despite the short-term correlation, the cryptocurrency market has outperformed equities in recent months. Since March, the total crypto market capitalization has risen by 8.5%, while the S&P 500 has declined by 5.3%. Over a six-month period, this divergence becomes even more pronounced: the total crypto market cap is up 29%, while the S&P 500 is down 2%. It is therefore inaccurate to suggest that these markets move in perfect synchrony, particularly when viewed over longer timeframes. Related: Bitcoin to $1M by 2029 fueled by ETF and gov’t demand — Bitwise exec It is still premature to declare a definitive bottom for the S&P 500 or to conclude that the trade war has been resolved. An economic recession would likely have negative implications for both markets. However, the current strength in equities indicates reduced risk aversion among investors. For the time being, the elevated correlation between cryptocurrencies and stocks may represent the most favorable scenario.

Bitcoin’s resilience above the psychological $90,000–$95,000 level, an unexpected surge in stablecoin issuance and a swarm of textbook bullish patterns across large-caps and meme names have converged to create what veteran chartist Josh Olszewicz calls “one of the cleanest multi-asset breakout tapes we’ve seen since late 2023.” Crypto Bull Run Back? Olszewicz’s argument begins and ends with liquidity. Two consecutive one-billion-dollar Tether mints on 29 April pushed combined USDT + USDC supply to a fresh all-time high, an event he frames as an unequivocal tailwind for speculative assets. “Tether’s been printing, printing, and minting, baby,” he said, emphasising that the dual $1 billion tranches arrived alongside a clear premium in the USDT/USD pair on Kraken—evidence, in his view, of real demand rather than opportunistic treasury rebalancing. “Typically that means people are deploying it in alts. That’s why stable-coin mints—specifically Tether—[are] generally bullish for alts because people are using it to speculate.” The liquidity pulse arrives just as several macro obstacles appear to be receding. Bitcoin survived a negative-print US GDP release, sticky PCE inflation data and what Olszewicz called “some jobs numbers that came out this week,” without surrendering its three-month up-trend. Meanwhile gold has rolled over and the Dollar Index remains pinned near cycle lows, recreating the “everything-rally” backdrop that powered crypto’s late-2023 melt-up. Funding markets, however, are delivering a curious split: “We still have negative funding on the BTC side on crypto exchanges. We have positive funding in legacy land with futures. So that’s very bizarre right now, but so far so good.” Against that backdrop, Olszewicz drills into the Ichimoku-cloud mechanics that underpin his altcoin watch-list. The premise is as old as the indicator itself: a daily candle close inside the cloud accompanied by a bullish Tenkan-Kijun (TK) cross triggers a mean-reversion target to the opposing edge of the cloud. “All these trades are always the same. I never treat them differently,” he said. “You get a better entry… it’s just a game of probabilities.” The strategy sets clear invalidations—either the Kijun line or a lower-low—and provides what he characterises as Dow-theory mean-reversion framed through an Ichimoku lens. That formula is now flashing across a surprising breadth of assets. Solana And Curve Solana sits at the top of his list. The layer-one token has posted six consecutive red daily candles, sculpting the “right shoulder” of an inverted head-and-shoulders whose neckline rises toward $200. “What I’ve got to laser focus on is this potential edge-to-edge move,” he explained, noting that ideal entries would materialise between $140 and $120 but are not essential. “Within the next week or two, you should get a great signal on an entry here on SOL just from the cloud.” Related Reading: XRP Gains Ground in Weekly Crypto Inflows as Ethereum Continues Downtrend Curve, by contrast, is already in motion—up double-digits on a day when most altcoins bled. “Why is it up 10 percent today and everything else is down? I don’t have a good answer for that,” he admitted. Yet the technical structure leaves little to interpret: a multi-month flat-bottom accumulation, a candle close inside the cloud near its lower boundary and a bullish TK cross. “You’re on your journey to somewhere up here—the other edge of the cloud,” he said, implying a measured-move objective near $1.20 that would represent a near-doubling from current levels. Ethereum And Litecoin Where Solana and Curve show imminent triggers, Ethereum remains the quintessential laggard, still chiselling out what Olszewicz labels a bottoming process. “It’s going to take ETH kicking and screaming to get started here but this is a bottom in process. Certainly may take you into June.” The calculus is familiar: traders intent on rotation may find better risk-adjusted returns elsewhere, returning to ETH only once its own daily cloud admits a candle close. Litecoin exhibits a similar dynamic, with an inverted head-and-shoulders outline that “feels a little early,” perhaps ripening by early June. FET, LINK, ALGO Fetch.ai breached the cloud on April 23 and already sports a bullish TK cross, yet Olszewicz acknowledges it arrives “after two or three weeks of up-move,” reducing risk-reward. Related Reading: CoinGecko Q1 Report: Top 10 Crypto Exchanges See Spot Trading Volume Drop To $5.4 Trillion Chainlink shows a textbook right-shoulder still under construction—“alerts at fifteen,” he suggests—while Algorand edges toward a 32-cent cloud target, one daily close away from confirmation. In each instance, the analyst reiterates that until the formal triggers print, the probability of follow-through remains statistically lower. DOGE, PEPE And WIF The most combustible corner of the market—the meme cohort—is, in his telling, already foreshadowing a retail return. Dogecoin intrigues him most. “Along with ENA, one of the best bang for your bucks is Doge,” he said, though he concedes the pattern needs another week to sculpt a complete right-shoulder. He is explicit about his trigger: “Give it another week or two and this is definitely one of the better-looking setups,” with attention fixed on the $0.175 area. PEPE presents fewer moving parts: it is inside the cloud with a bullish TK cross and a clear neckline at the Kijun. “If ETH even sneezes higher, I expect this to just be up twenty-five percent one day,” he said, while cautioning that a transitional “negative twenty percent day” could precede the pop. WIF, for its part, is “slamming against the cloud,” on the cusp of its own TK cross. Having retraced from $4.80 to current levels, it offers what he calls “a great-looking setup,” albeit one where “the greed in me always wants an entry down here”—a reference to a hypothetical bid parked at the cloud’s lower edge. BTC Dominance Bitcoin dominance, still pressing cycle highs, complicates the rotation narrative. “Does it really matter that you’re not all-in BTC if this is an extreme in dominance?” he asked rhetorically. His answer is temporal. Dominance mattered enormously at the October 2023 bottom, and he suspects it will matter again once it rolls over. “Come May, June, I think we will start to see the outperformance of the altcoins,” he predicts, but he tempers that with a blunt reminder: “It hasn’t made sense to sit in these BTC pairs.” The exception is Solana’s BTC chart, which mirrors the USD thesis with a half-formed inverted head-and-shoulders and a cloud target significantly higher. At press time, SOL traded at $151.90.

44043167,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=154487,1746140427,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Coinbase MOVE Trading: Urgent Suspension Announced,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/coinbase-move-trading-alert/,"Heads up, crypto traders! If you’re involved in Coinbase MOVE trading , there’s an important update you need to know. Coinbase has announced an upcoming change that will directly impact your ability to trade the MOVE token on their platform. What’s Happening with Coinbase MOVE Trading? Coinbase recently shared via their official X account that they will be suspending trading for the MOVE token. This isn’t just a temporary pause; it’s a complete halt to trading activities for this specific asset on their exchange. The suspension is scheduled to take place on May 15 at 2 PM ET . After this time, you will no longer be able to buy, sell, or trade MOVE tokens using Coinbase’s trading services. According to CoinGecko data at the time of the original announcement, the MOVE token was trading around $0.2303, experiencing a 3.2% dip over the preceding 24 hours. News like a trading suspension crypto can often influence market price, so it’s crucial for holders to be aware of the deadline. Why Does Coinbase Delisting Happen? Coinbase explained that this decision stems from their regular process of monitoring listed assets. They continuously evaluate cryptocurrencies on their platform to ensure they meet the exchange’s stringent listing criteria. When an asset no longer meets these standards, a Coinbase delisting becomes a possibility. The reasons behind a crypto delisting can vary. They often include factors such as: Failure to meet technical requirements (e.g., network issues, wallet support problems). Low trading volume and liquidity, making it difficult for users to trade effectively. Concerns about the project’s development, team, or future viability. Regulatory or compliance issues. Security vulnerabilities. Changes in market conditions or user demand. While Coinbase’s statement specifically mentioned ‘meeting listing criteria,’ the exact criteria that MOVE failed to meet were not detailed in the initial announcement. This is standard practice, as exchanges typically don’t disclose the specific reasons for each individual delisting. Impact of MOVE Token Delisting on Holders For anyone holding MOVE tokens on Coinbase, the most immediate impact of the MOVE token delisting is the loss of the ability to trade the asset on that specific platform after the May 15 deadline. This can affect liquidity and convenience. Key Considerations for Holders: Trading Stops: You won’t be able to execute buy or sell orders for MOVE on Coinbase after 2 PM ET on May 15. Withdrawals: While trading is suspended, users are typically still allowed to withdraw their affected tokens for a period after the suspension date. It is absolutely critical to check official communications from Coinbase regarding the withdrawal window. Don’t assume you have unlimited time. Price Volatility: Delisting announcements can sometimes lead to increased selling pressure on the affected asset on that specific exchange as holders look to offload before the deadline. Finding Alternatives: If you wish to continue holding or trading MOVE, you will need to withdraw your tokens to a private wallet or another exchange that supports MOVE trading. It’s important to remember that a delisting from one exchange, even a major one like Coinbase, doesn’t necessarily mean the token is dead or delisted everywhere. However, it does reduce accessibility and can impact market perception. Understanding Trading Suspension Crypto in Broader Context A trading suspension crypto is a measure exchanges take for various reasons, sometimes temporarily due to technical upgrades or network issues, and sometimes permanently as a prelude to full delisting. In this case, the announcement clearly indicates a permanent suspension of trading, leading to the effective delisting of MOVE from the platform. This isn’t the first time Coinbase, or any major exchange, has delisted an asset. It’s a necessary part of managing a dynamic cryptocurrency platform and portfolio. While inconvenient for affected users, it’s presented by exchanges as a way to maintain platform integrity and user safety. What Should MOVE Holders on Coinbase Do? Actionable Insights If you hold MOVE tokens on Coinbase, here are the crucial steps you should take immediately: Check Your Email/Coinbase Account: Look for official communication from Coinbase. They will provide detailed instructions regarding the suspension and, most importantly, the process and deadline for withdrawing your MOVE tokens. Decide Your Next Step: Do you want to sell your MOVE before the May 15 deadline? Do you want to withdraw it to a private wallet? Do you want to send it to another exchange that lists MOVE? Make a decision based on your investment strategy. Execute Your Plan Before the Deadline: If you plan to sell on Coinbase, do so before May 15, 2 PM ET. If you plan to withdraw, initiate the withdrawal well in advance of the deadline to avoid any last-minute issues. Ensure you have a secure wallet address or the correct deposit address for the receiving exchange. Be Aware of Fees: Factor in any withdrawal fees if you decide to move your tokens off the platform. Ignoring the deadline could result in your assets becoming inaccessible for trading on Coinbase, forcing you into a withdrawal process that might have its own time limits. Conclusion: Navigating the MOVE Suspension The announcement of the Coinbase MOVE trading suspension on May 15 at 2 PM ET is a significant event for holders of the token on the platform. This decision, based on Coinbase’s ongoing review of assets against their listing standards, means the MOVE token delisting is imminent for the exchange. While crypto delisting and trading suspension crypto events are part of the volatile nature of the market, they require prompt action from affected users. Ensure you understand the implications, check official Coinbase communications, and take the necessary steps to manage your MOVE tokens before the deadline.

The company is developing a full stack bitcoin mining platform, enhancing product velocity with open-source AI, and driving operating leverage in-house banking services. XYZ stock's valuation is attractive, trading at extremely low multiples despite solid growth prospects and impressive operating efficiency. The market misunderstands Block's bitcoin strategy, creating an asymmetric risk/reward opportunity as the company deepens its ecosystem and enhances financial accessibility. Shares of Fintech Block, Inc. ( XYZ ) cratered after the company reported weaker than expected earnings and slashed guidance . The report is definitely weaker than bulls like myself had hoped for, but it is illustrative of the challenging macro environment we are in. Despite this, I remain very optimistic about the company's long-term growth runway and see the vision that they are building quite clearly. The negatives in this report are clear: slowing gross profit growth, downward guidance revision, no growth in Cash App card users or transacting actives, high stock-based comp expense, and slowing GPV (gross payment volume) growth. The market has plenty of reasons to punish the stock after this report, but I still see several reasons to remain optimistic. For one, management believes the bottom is in for gross profit growth and expects 12% YoY growth for 2025 as a whole. Meanwhile, the market is completely ignoring the ongoing profitability inflection Block is enjoying. The company demonstrated strong operating leverage in its subscription and services line item, growing revenue by over $200m YoY (+12.5% YoY) while segment COGS grew only 2%. Segment gross margin grew from 83.9% to 85.5% YoY. Segment contributions here grew YoY from both Square and Cash App, and I maintain the conviction that this line item is the future driver of Block's growth. It's the key to a sustainable profitability inflection for the company, and recent news regarding Cash App Borrow, discussed below, will begin driving strong operating leverage in this line item. Block's highest margin segment is growing the fastest. This counts for something, despite the meager overall growth rates. Q1 Shareholder Letter Finally, management expects its first gross profit contributions from the Proto segment by year-end. This segment will capture sales of its bitcoin mining chip that is expected to begin recognizing revenue in 2H 2025. I wrote on Block earlier this year stating that the Bitcoin inflection is looming . I rated the stock a Strong Buy. The stock has underperformed the S&P (SP500) by a wide margin to date, and that underperformance is only widening in the post-market carnage. In this article, I stand by that rating. Core to my thesis is that Block is setting up critical infrastructure for an economy that sees increasing mainstream adoption of Bitcoin. The company is building a full stack bitcoin mining platform with an MDK (Mining Development Kit), a custom mining chip, and software to help more people access the bitcoin mining ecosystem. Although my previous rating has not worked in my favor to date, I maintain a strong belief that Block is a defining company in an era that is becoming increasingly friendly to cryptocurrency. I have a few other articles that are important to a discussion on Block's crypto opportunity. Namely, my article on MicroStrategy Incorporated ( MSTR ), and my recent Strong Buy rating on Bitcoin USD (BTC-USD) itself. For all intents and purposes, MSTR stock is effectively levered bitcoin. Bitcoin USD ((BTC-USD)) itself, at current, is essentially a call option on geopolitical turmoil and the erosion of trust in the US Dollar as a neutral mechanism for global trade. There has never been such a structurally bullish time for Bitcoin, considering the current U.S. administration is weaponizing its consumer base and reserve currency. Meanwhile, that same U.S. president has been outspoken on his desire to make the United States the crypto capital of the world . New York City, the financial capital of the world, is hosting its first-ever Crypto Summit this month. This article will not focus so heavily on Bitcoin. Clearly, the market is unimpressed with Block's maverick status within the crypto sphere, it doesn't care about the company's bitcoin accumulation, nor the fact that it enriches its user base by making bitcoin accessible, nor that it is becoming the first U.S. supplier of Bitcoin mining hardware. This misunderstanding by the market has led to a significant mispricing which is only exacerbated by today's selloff. I'd point you to my three aforementioned articles for a deeper understanding of my position on this mispricing. My Take Block has received an enormous amount of criticism stemming mostly from its poor stock performance. Investors are losing patience with CEO Jack Dorsey and the company's perceived lack of progress. While sales growth has stalled from the COVID-era boom, the stock's valuation has fallen more than enough at this point to compensate. The company traded at only 13.5x forward earnings and 11.6x forward cash flow before the post-market selloff today. The valuation is even more attractive now. Analysts expect Block to grow EPS in the double digits for the next several years. Further, Block's impressive operating efficiency is best illustrated by the fact that it generates over 180% more net income per employee than its sector peers. I believe now is a great time to either accumulate Block stock or initiate a position. For those unconvinced by the fundamentals of a compelling valuation, a growth reversal, and respectable efficiency, let's talk about the product velocity we've seen out of the company this year. For one, Block is the only Fintech (to my knowledge) that is openly embracing and developing its own open-source AI model, dubbed codename:goose . This is powered by the company's NVIDIA Corporation ( NVDA ) GB200 cluster. Internally, Block is using goose mostly for software engineering, but the potential for AI throughout Block's ecosystem is very promising. Goose will contribute to ongoing increases in product velocity and innovation. Over time, the company can lean into goose for fraud analytics, streamlining loan approvals, marketing ad targeting, and helping Square sellers create websites and marketing campaigns. It noted in the shareholder letter that it wants Cash App users and Square sellers to have a personal CFO and COO at their fingertips. Further, there was news recently that is important for Block's ongoing profitability inflection that went entirely ignored by the market. The company's in-house bank, Square Financial Services (""SFS""), received FDIC approval to provide Cash App Borrow loans. The company had previously partnered with an external bank for its nearly $9b in origination volume for this product in 2024. Bringing the servicing of these loans in-house enhances Block's unit economics by cutting out that intermediary. In other words, we can expect ongoing growth in the company's subscription and services gross margin. Management also noted that they are open to selling these loans off their book to maintain flexibility with their available capital. Combining this improvement in unit economics with the company's increased inflow and gross profit per user makes me confident they will continue growing subscription and services revenue and gross margin. The average Cash App Borrow loan was less than $100 and less than a month in duration in 2024. These are microloans aiming to replace payday loans which are outright predatory, considering they charge interest based on a fee structure , and have a clear product/market fit. Cash App Borrow has less than a 3% default rate historically. Very low risk. SFS has been servicing Square small business loans since it received its bank charter in 2021 and has seen solid success with its innovative repayment structure. Square sellers pay loans back slowly with a small percentage of each sale going to loan repayment. This greatly de-risks the company's credit book from the lending perspective, makes the loan easier to manage for Square sellers, and makes credit more accessible for small businesses. Block also recently released enhanced cashflow management capabilities for Square sellers, including savings recommendations for prudent expense management, and launched a new unified interface for full stack point-of-sale services. It's been a busy month of announcements for the company. Despite headcount reductions throughout 2024 , the company has actually increased product velocity. The company is operating with a renewed focus under the unified leadership of founder-CEO Jack Dorsey, and sits at three key inflection points with AI, the mass accessibility of financial services, and the proliferation of bitcoin as a means for cross-border settlement and as a modern savings vehicle. The market doesn't seem to understand the operating leverage that Block is achieving through these handfuls of initiatives. This gives investors who recognize these enhancements a wonderful opportunity to accumulate shares in an innovative technology company with a very compressed multiple. Investor Takeaway Owning Block stock has been frustrating for the past several years. Many long-term investors have grown impatient with the company's leadership and the lack of stock returns. I believe this only strengthens the bull case for the stock, considering we are at the point of broad-based market fear and capitulation in the stock. The company has been head-down and in the weeds driving product enhancements to better serve its growing customer base, while driving operating efficiency and enhanced unit economics. Broad-based weakness during Q1 and the ongoing uncertainty in Q2 drove weaker than expected results and guidance, and another frustrating selloff. I believe this selloff is a gift. The company is growing a durable extremely high margin segment in the double digits while deploying AI throughout its internal operations and products to increase innovation and value for customers. Further, the market seems to regard the company's bitcoin aspirations as a distraction. I couldn't disagree more. The company is becoming the first mining chip provider based in the U.S., the largest mining chip company is currently a Chinese chip designer, while deepening the accessibility of bitcoin throughout its ecosystem. Over time, as public perception of Bitcoin turns more favorable, Block will have several levers to facilitate the mass adoption of Bitcoin in cross-border trade, peer-to-peer payments, and retail transactions. The market is impatient with management's lack of focus on short-term profitability growth. Instead, management remains focused on achieving its mission of enhancing the accessibility of the modern economy for all people. This has created very durable, sticky customer relationships with both low-income consumers and small-to-medium sized businesses. The obvious risk with this strategy is that these consumers and businesses are the most sensitive to inflation and recessionary macro conditions. Now, the company has shifted focus to deepening relationships with Cash App consumers, leaning more heavily into banking services for both Cash App and Square, and building the infrastructure on which the Bitcoin economy will operate in the U.S. There is much to look forward to in Block's future. I maintain my Strong Buy rating despite the poor results from today.",BTC-USD|XYZ,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|FIAT|MARKET|MINING,"{'name': 'Seeking Alpha', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/seekingalpha.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",seekingalpha,2025-05-01 23:05:30
44043438,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=154488,1746141025,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Fivetran Acquisition of Census Creates Complete Data Movement Platform,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/fivetran-census-acquisition/,"In the fast-paced world of technology, where data is king for everything from blockchain analytics to operational efficiency, the infrastructure enabling smooth data flow is paramount. This is true for crypto enterprises and traditional businesses alike. A significant development in this crucial area is the recent news: Fivetran , a leader in automated data integration, has acquired Census, a prominent Reverse ETL platform. This move is set to transform how businesses manage their data, promising an end-to-end data movement platform . Understanding the Fivetran and Census Acquisition For over a decade, Fivetran has specialized in Extract, Transform, Load (ETL) processes, helping companies consolidate data from numerous sources into cloud data warehouses. Census, founded more recently in 2018, tackles the opposite challenge: Reverse ETL. It enables businesses to move data *out* of data warehouses and into operational tools like CRM, marketing automation, and support systems. The Census acquisition by Fivetran brings these two complementary capabilities under one roof. Why is this combination important? Complete Data Loop: Previously, companies often needed separate vendors for ETL (getting data in) and Reverse ETL (getting data out). The acquisition creates a single vendor for the entire data journey. Customer Demand: Fivetran’s CEO, George Fraser, stated that customers had been requesting a Reverse ETL solution for years, making this acquisition a direct response to market needs. Simplified Stack: Businesses can potentially simplify their data infrastructure stack, reducing complexity and vendor management overhead. Why This Move Made Sense: The Power of Reverse ETL Integrating a robust Reverse ETL solution was a strategic priority for Fivetran. While they considered building their own, they recognized the value of bringing in a company like Census that had already perfected the technology. Fraser highlighted that the underlying technical challenges for standard ETL and Reverse ETL are quite distinct, despite both involving data movement. Furthermore, the synergy between the two companies was clear. Fivetran and Census shared a significant number of customers. According to Fraser, customers who preferred Fivetran’s approach to data integration were also likely to appreciate Census’s philosophy regarding operational data sync. This shared customer base and similar product philosophies made Census a natural fit for Fivetran’s expansion. Building an End-to-End Data Movement Platform The goal is to build a truly comprehensive data movement platform . Once the acquisition is finalized, the Census team will join Fivetran, and the Census brand will be integrated into the Fivetran offering. This isn’t just about adding a feature; it’s about creating a unified experience for customers needing to move data in any direction. The deal terms were not disclosed, but Census had raised over $80 million in funding and was last valued at $630 million in 2022. The long-standing relationship between the founding teams also played a role, dating back to their time in the Y Combinator program. This acquisition is a significant development in the enterprise data landscape, providing businesses with a more streamlined and powerful way to leverage their data assets, from getting data into their warehouse to operationalizing it across their organization. For companies operating in data-intensive fields like cryptocurrency, having reliable and efficient data infrastructure is non-negotiable for growth and compliance.

The trade offer aims to increase imports of American goods and ease the transatlantic trade deficit. The drama from the Trump tariffs is still ongoing, and the EU is now pushing for what it considers a fair and balanced deal before July, when the tariffs will take effect. The EU’s strategic offer According to Maroš Šefčovič, the EU’s trade commissioner, the European Union is proposing a €50B increase in purchases of U.S. goods. The €50B investment is aimed at easing the growing trade tensions with Washington. Šefčovič told the Financial Times that the EU is making “certain progress” in its negotiations with the U.S. The EU however made it clear that it will not accept the 10% tariff recently imposed by President Donald Trump as a fair outcome. The proposal will also help to close what the U.S. perceives as a €50B trade deficit with Europe. Šefčovič stated this trade gap could be quickly closed if Europe increased its imports of American goods such as its liquefied natural gas (LNG), soybeans, and other agricultural products. “If what we are looking at as a problem in the deficit is €50B, I believe that we can really solve this problem very quickly,” he said. The bloc has been working to prevent a full-blown transatlantic trade war since Trump’s announcement of a 10% tariff on most countries on April 2. The U.S. government also proposed a 20% “reciprocal” tariff for the EU. The extra 20% tariffs were eventually suspended to allow 90 days for negotiation, but the initial 10% tariff remains in place, and further duties could be added on in July if no agreement is reached between the nations. Šefčovič explained that the EU is working on a deal that is “balanced and fair,” not one that locks in high tariffs. “It will be very difficult to reach a deal that is clearly good and acceptable for our member states and our European parliament,” he said. Retaliatory measures are still on the table The EU has so far embraced diplomacy during the trade talks, but the bloc did not neglect preparing for the worst. The European Commission, the agency responsible for negotiating trade deals on behalf of the EU’s 27 member states, has outlined both incentives for a deal and retaliatory measures in the event that negotiations fall through. On the topic of retaliatory measures, the EU has a €21B retaliatory tariff package ready for American goods such as Harley-Davidson motorcycles, poultry, and clothing. The tariff is currently paused until July 14. “We will be working meticulously with every member state to have a robust response, which would have unanimous support,” Šefčovič said. The Commission recently briefed its ambassadors on both negotiation tactics like carrots and sticks in a bid to prepare the bloc for any outcome. Šefčovič emphasized that while the EU is pushing for a resolution, it stands firm in rejecting tariffs it deems unfair. When he was asked directly if the EU would accept a 10% tariff baseline as a compromise, Šefčovič responded that such a level is “very high.” The EU has shown that it is open to adjustments and carve-outs announced by the U.S. government. Adjustments include changes such as relief for the automotive sector. Šefčovič suggested that that was likely in response to warnings about a potential economic fallout. Šefčovič also stated that the EU is open to cooperating with the U.S. on broader global trade challenges, including those related to China. He proposed working together to address issues like steel and aluminum overcapacity, semiconductor development, and reducing dependency on critical raw materials. “We believe that we can actually achieve a lot together,” Šefčovič said.

44043742,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=154489,1746141621,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Anthropic Claude Unveils Powerful New AI Integrations,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/anthropic-claude-integrations/,"The world of artificial intelligence is constantly evolving, with leading models pushing boundaries to offer more utility. For those following the intersection of AI and technology, Anthropic’s recent updates to their AI Chatbot , Claude, represent a significant step forward. These enhancements aim to make Claude a more powerful and interconnected tool for users across various plans. What are Anthropic Claude’s New AI Integrations? Anthropic has introduced a new feature called Integrations, available in beta for users on Claude Max, Team, and Enterprise plans (and coming soon to Pro). This builds upon Anthropic’s existing MCP protocol, which allows AI models to access data from various sources. Integrations take this further, enabling developers to create and host app servers that expand Claude’s abilities. Users can then discover and connect these servers directly to Anthropic Claude . Think of it this way: instead of just chatting with Claude, you can now allow it to interact with the tools you use daily. Anthropic highlights that connecting your tools gives Claude crucial context about your work, understanding project histories, task statuses, and organizational knowledge. This allows the Claude AI to potentially take actions or retrieve specific information directly from those connected platforms. Key Integration Examples: Atlassian: Enables Claude to summarize and create pages within Confluence. Zapier: Allows Claude to trigger actions within Zapier’s vast network of app automation workflows. Other Partners: Initial partners also include Cloudflare, Intercom, Square, and PayPal, each adding unique capabilities. These AI Integrations are designed to streamline workflows and make Claude a central hub for interacting with your digital environment. Exploring Advanced AI Research Capabilities Alongside Integrations, Anthropic also launched an expanded deep research capability called Advanced Research. This tool is designed to provide more comprehensive reports on a given topic by crawling a multitude of internal and external sources. While Anthropic’s previous research tool was fast, Advanced Research takes more time (from five to 45 minutes) to deliver deeper insights. This enhancement is particularly relevant as AI models, including the AI Chatbot landscape, increasingly incorporate ‘reasoning’ abilities. These models can break down complex problems and fact-check information, crucial skills for conducting in-depth research. Advanced Research leverages this, allowing Claude to investigate different parts of a request before compiling a detailed report. How Advanced Research Works: Breaks down complex requests into smaller components. Investigates each part deeply across hundreds of sources. Compiles findings into a comprehensive report. Provides clear citations linking back to original source material. Can utilize newly expanded connectors, including Integrations and local systems via the desktop app. This focus on thoroughness and source citation positions Advanced AI Research as a valuable tool for users needing detailed information and verification. Keeping Pace in the Competitive AI Landscape These new features, AI Integrations and Advanced Research, are part of Anthropic’s broader strategy to remain competitive with other leading models like Google’s Gemini and OpenAI’s ChatGPT. The AI market is rapidly advancing, and continuous innovation is necessary to attract and retain users, especially those on higher-tier plans. Anthropic reportedly has ambitious revenue goals, aiming for $34.5 billion by 2027, significantly up from their reported $1.4 billion annualized revenue in early March. Expanding the capabilities of Anthropic Claude through features like deeper research and app connectivity is key to achieving such growth by offering more value to enterprise and team users. Conclusion: A More Connected and Capable Claude Anthropic’s introduction of Integrations and the enhanced Advanced Research tool marks a significant evolution for the Claude AI . By allowing users to connect Claude to their essential apps and empowering it with deeper, more thorough research capabilities, Anthropic is making its AI Chatbot a more practical and powerful assistant for complex tasks. These updates are crucial steps for Anthropic as it navigates the competitive AI landscape and works towards its growth objectives, offering users more reasons to choose Claude for their advanced AI needs.

44044047,https://cryptonews.com/?p=356726,1746142200,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/52/44044047.jpeg,South Korean Regulator Designates Crypto Exchange Bithumb as a Conglomerate,https://cryptonews.com/news/south-korean-regulator-designates-crypto-exchange-bithumb-as-a-conglomerate/,"The South Korean Fair Trade Commission (FTC) has classified the crypto exchange Bithumb as a conglomerate. The designation will force the company to adhere to a range of financial compliance rules. Per Jeongi Shinmun , Bithumb was one of just five companies added to the FTC’s list of conglomerate companies and business groups on May 1. Bithumb Conglomerate Status: What Does it Mean? The South Korean government has two separate conglomerate categories. The first is the “large conglomerate” category, which is subject to the strictest level of public disclosure regulations. The South Korean Fair Trade Commission at the Government Complex in Sejong, South Korea. (Source: Minseong Kim [CC BY-SA 4.0]) South Korean law requires “large conglomerates” to abide by more comprehensive financial disclosure requirements than regular firms. Companies with this designation must post regular reports on the status of their stock holdings. The designation also requires directors and their family members to comply with strict expropriation rules. South Korea’s top court ruled that presidential candidate Lee Jae-myung violated election law and sent the case back to the high court for final sentencing. https://t.co/3EhhchGsvu — Bloomberg (@business) May 1, 2025 And firms in a second “conglomerate” category must adhere to investment and cross-holding rules. The government created the rules to prevent powerful companies from buying significant quantities of shares in stock exchange-listed firms. The FTC had previously ruled that the Bithumb rival Upbit qualifies as a “large conglomerate .” In May 2022, the body named Upbit’s operator Dunamu the South Korean crypto sector’s first official “large conglomerate.” It upheld its ruling in 2023 and 2024, but this year moved the operator into the lower “conglomerate” category, along with Bithumb. Both designations place a range of restrictions on company activities. They prevent, for instance, companies from making equity investments or loan guarantees with their affiliates and subsidiaries. Only Five Companies Added to FTC’s List Bithumb was one of just five companies added to the “conglomerate” list this year. The FTC also named the weapons-maker LIG, the real estate player Daekwang, the food manufacturer Sajo, and the shipping firm EUKOR. Trading volumes on the Bithumb crypto exchange over the past 12 months. (Source: CoinGecko) Chaebol Scrutiny Continues South Korea’s Fair Trade Act contains several clauses pertaining to corporations. Most of these were created in response to the rise of chaebol business groups. Chaebol groups are typically large, family-run companies with a wide range of business operations. Examples include Samsung, LG, and CJ. Critics claim that these groups wield excessive power in the business and political space, giving little room for smaller firms to operate. The act prohibits larger domestic companies from providing unfair benefits to “special related parties.” Its investment-related clauses were originally designed to stop the phenomenon of “circular investment,” whereby company owners obfuscate their financial activities by investing in their own subsidiaries. The FTC explained that both Bithumb and Upbit were placed on the list because of a sharp rise in crypto trading in late 20224. The body wrote that at around the time of the US Presidential Election, the volume of customer deposits on domestic exchanges increased rapidly. The FTC’s rulings on crypto exchanges have attracted criticism from some detractors. The agency calculates the worth of firms’ total asset holdings when making its evaluations. Some claim that, as most exchanges hold more crypto than fiat, it is hard to ensure the accuracy of these calculations.

Senate Majority Leader John Thune, a South Dakota Republican, started the ball rolling to fast-track the Guiding and Establishing National Innovation for U.S. Stablecoins (GENIUS) Act , which is the Senate's version of two similar bills rolling through both chambers of Congress. The House of Representatives is expected to follow closely behind on its own voting. Thune's move to expedite the bill is meant to limit delays and floor action in order to get it done more quickly. It's so far unclear precisely when the Senate vote will happen, but an earlier vote on the effort in the Senate Banking Committee had approved it with a wide bipartisan majority of 18-6. The House Financial Services Committee also advanced its similar bill in April. “I look forward to passing the GENIUS Act in short order to keep digital asset innovation in America, protect customers, and make sure foreign companies are playing by the same rules,” said Senator Bill Hagerty, the Tennessee Republican who authored the bill, in a statement. It's also backed by Senator Tim Scott, the chairman of the Senate Banking Committee. President Donald Trump's self-described crypto sherpa, Bo Hines, the executive director of the Presidential Council of Advisers for Digital Assets, told CoinDesk earlier this week that the two bills are as much as 90% similar and that members of both chambers are seeking to work out the differences.

SOL price has regained 50-day SMA as a support level and now eyes $180 next. After closing the past three weeks in a bullish outlook, Solana (SOL) price has signaled the return of bullish sentiment. The large-cap altcoin, with a fully diluted valuation of about $90 billion and a 24-hour average trading volume of around $3.7 billion, gained over 20 percent in April 2025 to trade at about $150.33 on Thursday, during the late North American session. The rising bullish momentum for Solana is heavily bolstered by institutional investors and rising Futures Open Interest (OI) by over $1.6 billion in the past four weeks. Midterm Expectations for Solana Price In the weekly timeframe, Solana price has been consolidating in a megaphone structure for the past twelve months. Following a successful rebound from the lower border of the macro megaphone, SOL price has gradually gained bullish momentum. Moreover, the weekly MACD histograms have been signaling a growing bullish momentum after a prolonged bearish period. Additionally, the weekly MACD line is almost crossing the signal line, suggesting bullish sentiment. Meanwhile, the Bollinger Bands for Solana price, in the four-hour timeframe, have been squeezing, signaling a major price move in the near future. Fundamental Outlook The Solana network remains a premier ecosystem for DeFi developers, with a total value locked (TVL) of about $8 billion and a stablecoins market cap of around $13 billion. The Solana network has recorded significant growth in memecoins in the past year, thus achieving a 24-hour active addresses of over 3.6 million across its DeFi protocols. The anticipated approval of spot Solana ETFs before the end of 2025, will play a crucial role in SOL’s market outlook. Moreover, the rising adoption of Solana from institutional investors will help validate the network and increase its demand and liquidity in the long haul.",Price Analysis,EN,0,0,ALTCOIN|BUSINESS|MARKET|SOL|TRADING,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-05-01 23:34:31
44044411,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=719183,1746142525,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/44044411.jpeg,Security flaw in Cosmos SDK may allow DDoS attacks,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/security-flaw-in-cosmos-sdk-may-allow-ddos-attacks/,"Blockchain security firm Oak Security has raised concerns about a vulnerability in the Cosmos chain software development kit (SDK) that could lead to a Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attack on the network. In a Medium post, two of the firm’s researchers, Edward Kotysh and Christian Vari, explained why this is a major risk. According to the researchers , the vulnerability lies in the fact that the BeginBlock and EndBlock functions are not subject to gas metering. This is by design, as it enables developers to have some free computation time, as these two functions do not necessarily affect user transactions. However, the security experts warned that what was meant to be a minor leeway for developers could actually cause significant damage to Cosmos-based networks in several ways. These include causing network congestion, affecting validators, or even leading to a complete outage. They said: “This freedom can be a double-edged sword, and it can open up a Pandora’s box of potential vulnerabilities. The main issue is that without gas limits, poorly optimized or malicious code in BeginBlock and EndBlock can really wreak havoc.” The researchers tested their theories on the potential impact of the vulnerability by conducting experiments. In one of the experiments, they introduced randomized delays to the BeginBlock function at various block heights, with delays ranging from five seconds to one minute. From the experiments, the experts confirmed that the delays led to substantial congestion in the network, slowing its progression and increasing the time needed to complete blocks. It also affected validators, with several of them failing to sign blocks at the required times and some missing voting phases completely. Unsurprisingly, the limited number of validators available to sign transactions (less than two-thirds) meant that the test chain experienced temporary outages. The researchers noted that this could result in a complete outage on the mainnet itself, where there are several transactions happening at once that need to be finalized. Oak Security recommends fixes for developers Meanwhile, the security experts have recommended solutions to fix the vulnerability before a bad actor exploits it. According to them, there is a need to implement strict computation bounds so that even anyone cannot simply add any attack vector that will cause excessive computation. They identified three different ways of implementing this solution. These include adding time complexity to the BeginBlock and EndBlock functions so they do not run indefinitely, context wrapping to keep resource-intensive operations into metered contexts, and validation of all inputs to the function. Additionally, they called for more comprehensive testing and simulation to determine how the vulnerability could be exploited and the potential of its impact. They also identified architectural safeguards and operational monitoring to ensure the networks operate by standard metrics and detect any significant deviation. Cosmos SDK launches new version Meanwhile, the Cosmos SDK has yet to comment on the security report and whether it will do anything to address the issue on their end. This might be because the identified vulnerability is actually a design feature and not a bug or malware, like recent security alerts on supply chain attacks. Fortunately, developers using the Cosmos SDK can implement most of the recommendations from security experts, enabling them to take control of what they deploy and ensure it is not vulnerable to DDoS attacks. Interestingly, Cosmos SDK recently launched its version v0.53.0. According to the announcement on X, the version is a response to the pain points that builders raised about the previous version. The latest version reportedly comes with unordered transactions, improved capacities for community pools, custom governance mechanisms, epochs, and custom minting. It also comes with bug fixes, and developers can already upgrade to it on GitHub. Cosmos SDK is a tool for developers to easily build their own customized network and integrate with the Cosmos blockchain, a network seeking to become the Internet of Blockchains.

This dip, rather than signaling weakness, may in fact represent a healthy retracement as the cryptocurrency prepares for a new upward move. The price structure appears bullish on higher timeframes, especially after POL recently rebounded off the lower boundary of a long-term descending channel. According to a crypto analyst, Polygon could be on the verge of an explosive rally toward the $1 mark. Classic Bullish Divergence Points To Imminent Breakout According to technical analyst MasterAnanda on TradingView, the Polygon ecosystem token (POLUSDT) is currently flashing one of the strongest technical reversal signals in the form of a textbook bullish divergence on the 3-day chart. Price action hit a new low on April 7, 2025, but the Relative Strength Index (RSI) had already bottomed earlier in July 2024 and has since been forming higher lows. Related Reading: Polygon (MATIC) To Come back From The Dead As Ascending Triangle Appears As noted by the analyst, this mismatch between the price and the momentum indicator is a classic signal that the downtrend may be losing steam. The signal is reinforced by the recent increase in volume and the broader bullish recovery observed across the cryptocurrency market. Zooming in on the 3-day chart structure, POLUSDT experienced a notable rebound after reaching its low on April 7. The price climbed steadily to $0.267 by April 22 before encountering resistance. What followed were two successive bearish candlesticks that appeared to trace a measured pullback, likely a retest of the upper boundary of the descending channel. This movement is significant because retests of this nature often precede major breakouts. Keeping this in mind, the analyst predicted a successful bounce from the trendline support, which could start a sustained rally toward $1. Polygon To $1: Window Of Opportunity Narrowing Analyst MasterAnanda noted that the current price action is merely a calm before a massive move. “The market is giving us one last chance to buy all we want before massive growth,” the analyst said, implying that a strong impulsive wave could be next. The RSI is currently in the mid-40s, and if the bullish setup plays out, a swift move to the 70+ zone could occur. Related Reading: Polygon Price Risks Plunge With 90 Million MATIC Tokens Selling At $0.5 In terms of a price target, the analyst predicted a full recovery above $1 with a specific target of $1.15. This would mark a full recovery for POL holders who have been holding throughout the downturn in 2025. This level corresponds to the 1.618 level on the Fib extension projected from the April 7 low. The Fibonacci extension levels plotted on the chart show other smaller price targets on the way to $1.15. Most notable are the $0.461 and $0.534 regions, representing the 0.5 and 0.618 extension levels, respectively, which could serve as interim consolidation zones. At the time of writing, Polygon is trading at $0.2420.

Devin Nunes, the chief executive and chairman of the Trump Media & Technology Group (TMTG), says in a new shareholder letter that the firm is exploring a token and a “Truth digital wallet.” Nunes, a former member of Congress, says the token could be used to pay for Truth+ subscription costs and “later be applied to other products and services in the Truth ecosphere.” Trump’s controversial Solana ( SOL )-based memecoin, TRUMP , ticked down after the news. The 48th-ranked crypto asset by market cap is trading at $12.70 at time of writing and is down more than 7% in the past 24 hours. In January, TMTG announced a partnership with financial services giant Charles Schwab to launch Truth.Fi, a fintech firm with crypto services. As a means of diversifying the firm’s reserves, TMTG’s board has approved an investment of $250 million to be custodied by Charles Schwab, which could go toward investment vehicles, exchange-traded funds (ETFs), separately managed accounts (SMAs), as well as Bitcoin ( BTC ) and other digital assets. In the recent shareholder letter, Nunes says the first two Truth.Fi products will be slates of customized SMAs and ETFs. “Both products will have an America-First theme, focusing on a diverse set of companies across multiple industries, with the ETFs offering both cryptocurrencies and traditional equities. To launch our financial products, Trump Media partnered with top-quality companies that have great synergy with our business and vision. We’ve joined with Index Technologies Group and Yorkville America Equities to develop the SMAs, and with Crypto.com and Yorkville America Digital to develop the ETFs. Trump Media is planning to invest, alongside you, in these products via its own cash reserves.” Trump’s ventures in the crypto world have generated significant public criticism: Ethereum ( ETH ) founder Vitalik Buterin said earlier this year that political coins represented “vehicles for unlimited political bribery.” In a February letter to the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) and the Office of Government Ethics, officials at the nonprofit consumer advocacy organization Public Citizen argued that Trump’s memecoin could be in violation of federal law regulating gifts to government officials.

Unlike other L2 solutions, this project will not feature any token and depends solely on donations. The project’s devs even commented on the launch: “General-purpose L2s should be commodities — simple, replaceable, and free from centralized dependencies or risky governance. Ethereum R1 is our answer to that call. The roll-up grounded in credible neutrality, decentralization, and censorship resistance.” Ethereum’s transaction fees dropped to its lowest in five years in April ETH developers claimed that most current L2s work more similarly to new L1 projects than scaling solutions with private allocations, opaque governance, and centralized control. Lately, users have also raised concerns about how Ethereum L2 projects have drifted from the main interests of the base layer. The Ethereum R1 is a way to address all those issues, with the project team emphasizing that it will neither have venture funding nor any pre-mined token allocations or a governance token. The network had started to lay ground for new L2 projects much earlier. In March 2024, they released the Dencun upgrade, which reduced fees for its existing L2 scaling solutions. However, its base layer revenue had dwindled by nearly 100% by September of that year. Moreover, transaction fees on its base layer have continued to sink, reaching a five-year low of $0.16 per transaction in April 2025, primarily driven by reduced demand for block space. Some analysts have hinted that L2 growth incentives caused the base layer revenue declines, asking the network to reconsider its options. Ethereum’s dominance and demand is picking up In the past few months, the demand and relevance among new users for the ETH network have dropped. However, according to Growthepie, there was a 62% rise in active addresses week-on-week and another 57% surge in Layer 2 dominance. Recently, ETH had the highest market sentiment with 82%, while Solana and Bitcoin followed at only 3.6% and 2.7% respectively. In addition, Loookchain reported that crypto whales have been rushing to purchase ETH. In the last few hours, they acquired 5,362 ETH for over $7.2 million. One trader with the address ‘0xDdb4’ received a loan from Aave, about $3.44 million USDC from Aave, and purchased 1,856 ETH. Another whale, ‘0xf84d’, borrowed $1.64 million USDC, topped it up, and bought 1259 ETH with $2.34 million USDC. The other trader, ‘0x69D0’, took up 2,250 ETH worth around $4.12 million from the Binance crypto exchange. Ethereum flashes bottom signal as key metric hints at major rebound ahead Ethereum price was on a bullish path yesterday, May 1, after crossing above $1,850 for the first time in more than three weeks. The gains come amid chatter that ETH may have hit a local bottom, with key on-chain metrics supporting this hypothesis. ETH value today trades at $1,841 with a modest 2.56% gain in 24 hours. The uptrend coincides with a 60% spike in trading volumes as the market eagerly awaits whether a breakout above the psychological level of $2,000 will happen next. Ethereum has traded below the $2,000 level for most of the past two months. The price hit a low of below $1,400 on April 9. It had made something that amounted to a run to $1,550 and higher by April 22, though following a broad market lift on Bitcoin, it regained momentum. The ETH price, however, dipped again on April 30, falling to $1,736 within two hours. ETH price simply had more forced closures during this dip, topping $67 million compared to Bitcoin’s $64 million. Of the total $291 million, $48 million was on long positions, per Coinglass data . Such liquidations often lead to a rapid drop in price, ruining leveraged traders and short-term sentiment. Following this, Ethereum’s short-term chart has formed a head and shoulders pattern. This technical formation is usually connected to trend reversals and how traders will assess the upcoming price movement. Cryptopolitan Academy: Want to grow your money in 2025?

Kraken said in a May 1 report that its NinjaTrader acquisition would give its US customers access to the traditional derivatives market, aligning with its plans to expand its offerings and be the go-to platform for all types of trading. NinjaTrader is a registered Futures Commission Merchant with the Commodity Futures Trading Commission. Last month, it rolled out trading for over 11,000 stocks and exchange-traded funds to certain US clients. The deal, which Kraken dubbed the largest ever between a crypto and traditional finance firm, allows NinjaTrader to expand to the UK, continental Europe and Australian markets and comes as Kraken is preparing for an initial public offering in early 2026. The company is exploring a debt package worth between $200 million and $1 billion to facilitate that transaction. Kraken revenue, trading volume falls on Trump’s return Kraken’s $471.7 million revenue in Q1 marked a 19% increase from the year-ago quarter but a 6.8% fall from Q4 2024 . The exchange reported that trading volume fell 9.6% quarter-over-quarter to $208.7 billion while the value of its custodied assets fell 18% to $34.9 billion over the same time. Kraken attributed the drop to a “slowdown in overall market trading activity” as US President Donald Trump’s threats of implementing sweeping tariffs triggered an 18% fall in the crypto market cap over the quarter. Key metrics from Kraken’s Q1 report. Source: Kraken Kraken is one of several crypto platforms that saw record or near-record highs in trading activity in Q4 as Trump's November election win sparked larger-than-usual market volatility. Related: Kraken rolls out ETF and stock access for US crypto traders Kraken said that despite a “softening market,” its adjusted EBITDA — earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization — jumped 1% from the previous quarter to $187.4 million. The firm also saw the number of funded accounts on its platform increase 10% quarter-on-quarter to 3.9 million, signaling “deeper client engagement.” Reuters reported on April 18 that Kraken restructured its workforce after Arjun Sethi was appointed as co-CEO last October. Sethi has laid off around 400 employees since.

The regulatory challenges XRP faces diminish its potential as a top performer in 2025. Attention of traders now shifts toward Mutuum Finance (MUTM) since this DeFi project demonstrates fast growth beyond Ripple’s targets. The Mutuum Finance has gathered $7.3 million in funding since inception as it accumulated over 9,200 investors who have purchased tokens at $0.025 before the prospective 20% growth during the next phase. Investors who join today will receive a 140% return on investment by the time Mutuum Finance lists. MUTM gains potential for substantial upside potential while XRP stalls because investors are showing increased interest in the new asset. XRP Price Prediction: Will $5 to $7 be the Next Target for Ripple? Analysts predict XRP will experience a market-legendary price increase because it continues to expand despite regulatory hurdles towards reaching $5 value during the fourth quarter of 2025. XRP demonstrates promise through increasing institutional interest together with recent legal triumphs that will enable worldwide acceptance in financial services and technological markets. The worldwide status XRP establishes as a cross-border payments authority will help it soar to even greater elevation in its upcoming market cycle. The strong growth path of XRP meets competition from Mutuum Finance (MUTM) which shows rising popularity for its future market potential in 2025. Mutuum Finance Presale Gaining Momentum Currently at Phase 4, Mutuum Finance tokens are priced at $0.025. As the presale reaches Phase 5, the token price will rise to $0.03, giving early investors a built-in advantage. To further increase interaction, Mutuum Finance has recently launched a live leaderboard, highlighting the top 50 token holders. Those who are able to rank high will receive bonus tokens, adding a competitive, rewarding factor for early adopters. Mutuum Finance is innovative by combining the optimal elements of Peer-to-Contract (P2C) and Peer-to-Peer (P2P) lending models. In the P2C model, users lend stablecoins like USDT to smart contract-based liquidity pools and earn passive income while facilitating fast and secure borrowing. Conversely, in the P2P model, lenders and borrowers are directly connected, and therefore full confidentiality and greater control over terms are provided without employing any intermediary. This hybrid solution provides an equilibrium approach to decentralization, security, and efficiency and thus will attract both conservative investors who desire stable returns and those who seek greater freedom and flexibility. Designed for Stability and Security Stability together with security are central design objectives of Mutuum Finance since its foundation. The project delivers complete collateralization of its stablecoin by making it backed by the USD without algorithmic instabilities while ongoing smart contract audits and financial transparency commitments strengthen user trust and business sustainability. Mutuum Finance seeks community expansion through its $100,000 giveaway that gives each of ten winners $10,000 worth of MUTM tokens in addition to its referral program which rewards members who spread the network. Ripple (XRP) is primed for a breakout as it rides the momentum of increasing institutional adoption and a series of favorable court rulings, potentially reaching $5 to $7 by Q4 2025. As XRP surges, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is also emerging as a significant player in the DeFi space, offering early investors a rare opportunity with prices set to rise 20% in Phase 5. The combination of Ripple’s institutional push and Mutuum Finance’s innovative approach to decentralized lending makes these two assets worth watching closely in 2025.

Since then, the token has surged over 115%, marking a sharp and aggressive short-term uptrend. This rally reflects a growing appetite for risk among traders and renewed confidence across the broader crypto market. As major assets like Bitcoin and Ethereum consolidate near key resistance levels, smaller-cap tokens such as HYPE are gaining traction—benefiting from the increased momentum and speculative interest. Related Reading: Whales Sell 262,000 Ethereum Amid Recent Price Surge – Smart Exit Or Profit-Taking? Bulls are firmly in control, driving HYPE to test and reclaim critical technical levels. Top analyst Big Cheds shared a technical analysis on X, highlighting that HYPE is showing a strong response after retesting a key liquidity level. This price action, according to Cheds, may signal the beginning of a more sustained upward movement, especially if HYPE maintains its current structure and volume trends. With on-chain activity rising and market sentiment improving, all eyes are now on HYPE to see whether it can continue outperforming its peers. If bulls maintain momentum and reclaim higher resistance levels, HYPE could extend its rally and become one of the standout altcoin performers of the quarter. HYPE Eyes Breakout As Bulls Defend Key Levels HYPE continues to establish itself as one of the leading DeFi projects in the current market cycle, acting as a major decentralized exchange (DEX) with growing user activity and liquidity. After a strong run-up over the past few weeks, the token is now approaching a critical juncture as bulls attempt to reclaim the range highs and push through the psychological $20 resistance level. Despite recent bullish momentum, global macroeconomic uncertainty and rising geopolitical tensions are keeping the crypto market volatile, especially for altcoins. In this context, HYPE’s price action stands out. After a sharp move upward, the token faced a brief pullback, but according to Big Cheds, the response to this “throwback” was notably strong. The bounce from the $17 zone shows clear support, reinforcing buyer interest at these levels. Ched’s analysis suggests that this healthy retest of a previous liquidity pocket could fuel the next leg up. If bulls maintain control, HYPE could break through $20 and test the next significant supply zone above it. However, a short period of consolidation may be necessary to build enough momentum for the breakout. Related Reading: Solana Monthly Candle Reclaims Key Levels – Is $240 The Next Target? With fundamentals backing its growth and technicals flashing strength, HYPE is positioned as one of the key DeFi tokens to watch. A confirmed move above $20 could open the door to price discovery and cement HYPE’s leadership role among decentralized exchanges. Price Action Details: Holding A Bullish Structure HYPE is currently trading above $19 after a decisive move that pushed it beyond key short-term resistance. The token has shown strong momentum over the past two weeks, supported by growing market confidence and rising volume across decentralized finance platforms. Bulls are clearly in control, but the next major hurdle lies at the $22 level. Reclaiming $22 is critical for confirming a breakout and continuing the rally toward new all-time highs. This zone represents both psychological resistance and a historical supply region where sellers previously took profits. A clean push above $22 would likely trigger fresh buying and shift HYPE into price discovery mode. However, risks remain if momentum fades or broader market conditions weaken. The $17 level is now a key support zone to watch. If bulls lose control and price drops below that mark, HYPE could retrace further into lower demand zones, likely targeting the $14–$15 region. Related Reading: Ethereum Consolidates Against Bitcoin – Dominance Shift On The Horizon? For now, as long as HYPE holds above $19 and builds momentum, the bullish structure remains intact. The coming sessions will be crucial to determine whether the token has enough strength to clear $22 and continue leading the DeFi sector’s recovery.

Arbitrum, one of Ethereum’s leading layer 2 networks, has been actively distributing ARB tokens to support the development of its ecosystem. Its DAO has reportedly rolled out several hundred million dollars in grants, service provider funding, and incentives; however, according to Entropy Advisors, there has been little oversight on how these funds are actually spent. Interestingly, recent investigations have uncovered at least three separate incidents of grant misappropriation. One of them was the Furucombo case . The Arbitrum foundation accused Furucombo of misusing the backfund STIP grant after it failed to file a final report on how it spent the grant. Along with other transgressions, the Arbitrum DAO banned Furocombo from the DAO after extensive voting. Another case is the Gaming Catalyst Program (GCP), which received 225 million ARB worth approximately $215 million in early 2024. The GCP team is embroiled in allegations of misappropriation, underreporting and lack of transparency in its grant issuance, with a proposal launched to claw back funding. Recognizing the potential for further undiscovered abuses, Entropy Advisors proposed a system to enable the community to report misuse with the incentive of significant monetary rewards. The grant misuse bounty initiative proposed by Entropy Advisors has been tagged “The Watchdog.” In its proposal, Entropy Advisors defined the misuse of funds as “Any action or inaction by a recipient of DAO-allocated funds that directly violates the stated terms, objectives, agreement, or overall spirit of the allocation under which those funds were provided.” How the Watchdog program works The Watchdog program, which is proposed to operate like the more common bug bounty program, encourages community members to report inappropriate use of DAO funds privately through GlobaLeaks, the open-source whistleblowing platform used by governments, NGOs, and investigative journalists. As stated in the proposal, all submissions are private and secure, and whistleblowers can earn between $5,000 and $100,000 per confirmed report, with payouts determined by the severity of the violation and the quality of evidence provided. The process begins with a confidential submission of findings to a review committee, composed of members from Entropy Advisors, Arbitrum Foundation, and SeedGov. The committee of reviewers then go on to test the validity of the submission and also determine the severity of the misuse of funds. The severity, which ranges from low to high, in turn determines the amount that will be paid out to the whistleblower. For low severity submissions, whistleblowers can get a base payout of 1,000 ARB, which is deducted from the recovered funds if applicable, with the total possible reward being capped at $10,000. For cases with medium severity, the proposed bounty is a base payout of 10,000 ARB, and the maximum reward yield in the category is $25,000. Finally, for cases that rank high in order of severity, the bounty prize is a base payout of 30,000 ARB, while the maximum payout here is capped at $100,000. Cases like that of Furocombo fall under the medium category due to severity, as it involved the misuse of DAO-allocated funds that impacted the DAO’s resources. Proposed timelines for implementation The proposed launch date for the Watchdog bounty program is the end of May, with the Entropy Advisors proposal being subject to on-chain voting from May 8 to May 22. The results of the voting will greatly impact the program‘s launch date. Entropy Advisors also propose that an initial 400,000 ARB tokens be allocated to fund the program. According to them, the implementation of this program will not only deter malicious actions and actors, but it will also attract sophisticated on-chain sleuths and investigators to Arbitrum.

The company says its decision is less about TRUMP or cryptocurrency and more about the upcoming U.S.-Mexico tariffs that threaten business needs. TRUMP meme coin faces scrutiny over potential misuse of president’s crypto wealth The TRUMP meme coin has been controversial since its launch. Much of the President’s cash is wrapped up in crypto. An influential group of experts and former regulators have said the coin raises concerns about potential misuse. Freight Technologies announcing they plan to spend $20 million on constructing TRUMP Treasury has only added to that concern. The company’s press release provides insight into the investment’s reasoning. While it briefly touches on Freight’s interest in AI and Web3 technologies, the main focus is on how U.S.-Mexico trade tariffs might affect the company: “At the heart of our mission is the promotion of productive and active commerce between the United States and Mexico. Mexico is the United States’ top goods trading partner. We believe that adding Official TRUMP tokens is an effective way to advocate for fair, balanced, and free trade between Mexico and the U.S.,” said CEO Javier Selgas. Freight Technologies’ investment sparks speculation over U.S.-Mexico tariffs and stock slide Freight Technologies plays a key role in cross-border shipping with Mexico and is using AI to optimize trade between the two nations. The company sees the potential for a trade war with Mexico to disrupt its operations severely. Although President Trump has previously granted tariff exemptions to certain businesses, the company’s statement does not specifically appeal to him for such a carve-out. Reports suggest that some crypto companies received indirect legal benefits after donating to Trump’s inauguration fund, with some donations as small as $100,000. So, could Freight’s $20 million investment make an impression? While it’s hard to make definitive claims, the company’s actions surrounding the TRUMP deal raise eyebrows—the majority of its reasoning for the purchase centers on U.S.-Mexico trade relations. The press release briefly mentions that the TRUMP tokens could help diversify the company’s crypto holdings, but this is the only mention unrelated to tariffs. Suppose Freight Technologies is indeed attempting to influence the President. In that case, it seems likely that the company would prefer the Mexico tariffs to be removed entirely, not just seek an exemption for itself. At any rate, this TRUMP buy could prove to be bad news for Freight’s stock. The press release was first written on the 30th of April but attracted much attention in the crypto circles on the 1st of May. As the headlines spread, the company’s stock plunged more than 20%. This is one to watch closely. More companies are creating Strategy-style plans around cryptocurrencies. Freight Technologies may be among the first, but they likely won’t be the last. Trump’s meme coin surges 58% after exclusive dinner invitation to top holders President Trump’s meme coin, which had dropped 88% from its recent peak, experienced a surge last Wednesday after the coin’s website invited the top 220 holders of the digital token to an “intimate private dinner” with the president. Following the dinner invitation posted on the $TRUMP meme coin website and Twitter account, the coin’s value spiked by $5.32, or 58%, reaching $14.32 by Wednesday afternoon. This increase, however, only partially offset the coin’s significant drop from its high of $75.35 on January 19, the day before Trump’s inauguration. The dinner invitation promises $TRUMP coin investors the chance to “Hear close-up, from President Trump, about the future of Crypto!” Trump, who has expressed plans to make the U.S. the global cryptocurrency hub, has also launched several digital ventures, including NFTs branded as “Trump digital trading cards” and a cryptocurrency platform called World Liberty Financial. According to the Trump coin website, CIC Digital LLC, an affiliate of The Trump Organization, and Fight Fight Fight LLC together hold 80% of the meme coin supply. Fight Fight Fight is a Delaware-based LLC, as reported by the Wall Street Journal. Cryptopolitan Academy: Tired of market swings? Learn how DeFi can help you build steady passive income.

This is the question defining early 2025. Bitcoin holds the $100K zone with RSI strength and rising institutional inflows. On one end, Bitcoin is surging again, with strong accumulation zones and bullish structures attracting institutional momentum. On the other hand, some are looking beyond charts—into projects that solve real problems, not just dominate newsfeeds. This is where Qubetics ($TICS) rises above the noise. While legacy networks struggle with scaling issues or a narrow focus, Qubetics is building real tools for real-world use. From cross-border automation to decentralized development infrastructure, it’s not chasing a trend—it’s engineering the backbone for tomorrow’s digital economy. And judging by the numbers, the community is taking notice. Bitcoin Stalls Near $95K — Is the Next Bitcoin Price Prediction Calling for $138K? Bitcoin entered Q2 2025 with renewed strength, trading just above $109,000 after breaking out of its March consolidation zone with a sharp 12% gain. Analysts now view the $115,000 to $118,500 region as the next central resistance zone, with key Fibonacci levels projecting breakout targets at $124,300 and $138,000. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) remains near 61, well within healthy territory, indicating that Bitcoin still has room to run before reaching exhaustion. Beyond charts and indicators, Bitcoin’s structural appeal has been reignited by strong macro signals. ETF inflows are rising sharply, supported by newly proposed reserve policies in multiple economic blocs. The supply of BTC on exchanges has dropped to its lowest point in over three years, creating a liquidity crunch just as demand accelerates. This tightening supply dynamic is reinforcing the bullish thesis, particularly among large funds seeking long-term hedges in a volatile global economy. Cycle-based models are now forecasting a potential peak above $150,000 by Q4 2025, echoing the historic blow-off top pattern observed after previous halvings. On the technical front, Bitcoin is trading within a bullish flag formation on the weekly chart, with its lower support at $101,200 and a resistance trendline that is climbing toward $133,000. If current macroeconomic conditions persist, particularly with global de-dollarization trends and increasing rate volatility, Bitcoin’s narrative as a non-sovereign store of value is likely to fuel continued accumulation. Traders and analysts alike are treating this cycle not as speculative noise but as a strategic build-up toward a long-awaited parabolic leg. In short, Bitcoin’s price prediction narrative is no longer just about volatility—it’s about validation. Market Impact: Bitcoin’s Strength Validates the Entire Crypto Asset Class Bitcoin (BTC) is trading at approximately $95,177, representing a modest 0.42% increase over the past 24 hours. Bitcoin’s current structure—trading within a bullish flag and witnessing a sharp drop in exchange-held supply—signals far more than just price movement. It reflects a fundamental shift in how institutional capital is treating Bitcoin: not as a speculative asset, but as a strategic, non-sovereign store of value. As ETF inflows continue to grow and reserve frameworks around Bitcoin emerge across multiple economic regions, BTC is increasingly being viewed as a foundational asset for macro portfolios. This structural confidence is not only reinforcing Bitcoin’s dominance—it’s validating the entire crypto asset class. Bitcoin’s liquidity profile, combined with its proven monetary policy and historical track record, positions it as the benchmark against which all other digital assets are measured. Its price movement no longer represents short-term market sentiment; it sets the tone for regulatory clarity, sovereign adoption, and global financial evolution. In 2025, Bitcoin is no longer fighting for legitimacy. It has it. And in doing so, it anchors the credibility of decentralized finance at large, sending a clear signal to capital markets that blockchain is no longer a fringe experiment—it’s becoming economic infrastructure. Qubetics: Solving Real Problems with Real Tools Qubetics is a Layer 1 blockchain designed not just to compete, but to simplify and scale what previous blockchains couldn’t. At the center of its utility engine is QubeQode, a low-code tool that lets users deploy smart contracts and decentralized applications without deep programming expertise. Unlike platforms that demand months of Solidity training, QubeQode offers drag-and-drop modules and visual scripting, helping businesses and professionals build systems like tokenized payroll, supply chain tracking, or royalty-based digital publishing in a fraction of the time. Backing this tool is the Qubetics IDE, an integrated development environment built to empower blockchain developers with faster workflows, real-time error detection, and native deployment across multiple chains. Whether it’s building a finance app or automating digital identity management, the Qubetics IDE turns technical complexity into operational clarity. The platform’s traction speaks volumes. Qubetics is in its 32nd presale stage. The token price stands at $0.2093. Over 510 million $TICS tokens have already been sold, drawing participation from more than 25,500 holders. The presale tally has now crossed $16.5 million, a clear indicator of strong confidence and growing market attention. This isn’t just another speculative cycle—it’s functional infrastructure in motion. If the token hits $1, it brings a 378% return. At $5, that rises to 2,289%. A post-mainnet value of $15 would mark a staggering 7,066% ROI. These aren’t just theoretical multipliers; they’re the result of product-driven traction and real-world use. What Experts Are Saying About Qubetics: Can $2,000 Morph Into $143K by Mainnet? It’s not just hype—it’s math backed by momentum. With Qubetics ($TICS) sitting at $0.2093 in its 32nd presale stage, a $2,000 entry bags roughly 9,555 tokens. If $TICS hits just $1 after the presale, that stack turns into $9,555—already a 378% gain. Push that to $5, and it rockets to $47,775. But it doesn’t stop there. If Qubetics climbs to $10, you’re looking at $95,550. And if the project reaches $15 post-mainnet, that same $2,000 could explode into $143,325. Conclusion: Two Giants, Two Paths—Same Destination? Bitcoin and Qubetics operate on different frequencies. One is the standard-bearer, built on scarcity and trust. The other is a rising infrastructure project focused on usability and technological empowerment. But in 2025, both are showing why they matter. Bitcoin commands attention through strength, legacy, and tightening supply dynamics. The price action aligns with institutional adoption, and its evolving regulatory clarity adds fire to the Bitcoin price prediction narrative. Meanwhile, Qubetics doesn’t just promise—it delivers. With QubeQode and its full-stack IDE, it lowers the barrier to blockchain creation, expands use cases, and secures massive ROI potential through real-world engagement. For community members looking to be part of meaningful innovation, not just watch it, Qubetics offers an entry point backed by more than hype. For those seeking foundational digital assets with liquidity and legacy, Bitcoin continues to prove it still sets the tone. Both offer unique strengths—but only one still gives early access. The Qubetics crypto presale isn’t open forever. Bitcoin isn’t staying cheap forever. Timing, as always, decides the outcome.

Kraken said the applicant’s red flags appeared early on in the process when they joined an interview under a name different from what they applied with and “occasionally switched between voices,” apparently being guided through the interview. Rather than immediately rejecting the applicant, Kraken decided to advance them through its hiring process to gather information about the tactics used. International sanctions have effectively cut North Korea off from the rest of the world, and the country’s ruling Kim family dictatorship has long targeted crypto companies and users to top up the country’s coffers. It’s stolen billions worth of crypto so far this year. Kraken reported that industry partners had tipped them off that North Korean actors were actively applying for jobs at crypto companies. “We received a list of email addresses linked to the hacker group, and one of them matched the email the candidate used to apply to Kraken,” it said. With this information, the firm’s security team uncovered a network of fake identities used by the hacker to apply to multiple companies. Kraken also noted technical inconsistencies, which included the use of remote Mac desktops through VPNs and altered identification documents.

North Korean-linked hackers also stole more than $650 million through multiple crypto heists during 2024, while deploying IT workers to infiltrate blockchain and crypto companies as insider threats, according to a statement released by the US, Japan and South Korea in January. In April, a subgroup of Lazarus was found to have set up three shell companies , with two in the US, to deliver malware to unsuspecting users and scam crypto developers.

The meme coin failed to break a significant resistance level that contains a huge chunk of all SHIB coins in circulation, as per market information. Related Reading: Only XRP?

Almost 40% of those who own the dog-themed cryptocurrency are in profit at present. A breakout above $0.000014 would reverse this figure, leaving the majority of SHIB owners in profitable positions for the first time in weeks. Price Stuck In Narrow Trading Range The meme coin now trades within a tight 24-hour price range of $0.0000130 to $0.00001374, according to recent charts from IntoTheBlock. While prices are consolidating, some large investors seem to be adding more. The Chaikin Money Flow (CMF) indicator has once again turned positive, indicating renewed buying by deep-pocketed traders. Although it has risen more than 10% this month, technical indicators are sending mixed signals. The Stochastic Relative Strength Index is between 11 and 9, indicating SHIB may be trading below what experts view as its fair market value. This is even as trading volumes have fallen in recent days. Massive One-Day Token Burn Raises Eyebrows Meanwhile, more than 280 million SHIB tokens were irreversibly taken out of circulation in one day. Based on tracking platform Shibburn, this is a 38,299% rise in the burn rate – an unprecedented increase that surprised many market observers. Source: Shibburn Related Reading: Code Wars: Cardano Claims The Crown From Ethereum In Core Development This drastic burn lowers the circulating supply to around 584 trillion tokens. The SHIB community has long advocated for token burning as a means of inducing scarcity, which in theory would drive up the value of existing coins by lowering supply. The recent burn is a stark reversal following weeks of declining token removal rates. This is seen by some as a sign of renewed confidence among “whales,” or large investors, as well as smaller token holders, but others caution that burn rates alone do not necessarily indicate price ascent. Market participants are now closely monitoring if the synergy of technicals, increasing whale appetite, and token burning aggression will be enough for SHIB to break its strong resistance levels. With general market sentiment picking up in cryptocurrencies, the next couple of weeks could be crucial for the direction of the price of the popular meme token.

The proposal, posted on May 1 to Sky’s decentralized autonomous organization ( DAO ) forum, would see the Sky (SKY) token take over the Maker (MKR) token as the protocol’s governance token. If the DAO accepts, the change would be slated to take place around May 15 to May 19 and downgrading from SKY to MKR would also be disabled. Sky co-founder Rune Christensen said in response to the proposal that it was a “huge milestone,” which he “fully supports,” and laments that allowing users to downgrade from SKY back to MKR has been a “key limiting factor preventing exchanges from adopting SKY.” “With this change, exchanges are likely to move faster in quickly adopting SKY without concerns about fracturing liquidity,” he said. Source: Sky Penalties on MKR holders who are slow in switching to SKY have also been proposed. According to the proposal, a 1% delayed upgrade penalty would apply to all MKR to SKY upgrades starting Sept. 18, increasing every three months. Users hit with a delayed upgrade penalty will also obtain fewer SKY tokens. Sky staking, temporary pause on liquidations Christensen said the most important change would be to see SKY staking enabled as part of the changes to the protocol. Rewards for its decentralized stablecoin , USDS, which are based on the income the Sky Protocol generates, will be enabled two or three weeks after the upgrade of the governance contract, with a splitter rate of 50%, according to Christensen. Source: Rune Christensen “Getting past the full upgrade of MKR to SKY is one of the last pieces missing before Sky can transition to 0 fixed costs at the end of 2025, which will ensure an even greater portion of the income the protocol generates goes to the benefit of SKY buybacks, or SKY Staking Rewards,” he said. SKY liquidations will also be temporarily disabled while the one-way MKR to SKY transition is still in its early stages. Related: Sky doubles down on token overhaul: Making MKR unusable, launching subDAOs “This is necessary to prevent risk from price manipulation to the SKY and MKR price while the transition is happening,” Christensen said. “When SKY market liquidity is restored, Sky Governance will lift the liquidation freeze and move risk parameters to long-term targets,” he added. Maker rebranded to Sky in August last year but after confusion and negative feedback, Christensen considered going back to the original Maker name just months later. However, a November poll saw 79% of tokenholders vote to keep the Sky brand as the back end protocol brand with no further changes.

Market analysts are watching closely, as recent movements have opened up the possibility of further gains. Looking at the 4-day chart, an analyst has said that there are two main possible scenarios for XRP’s price direction: 1. The Yellow Scenario (More Likely) This scenario shows XRP continuing to rise, possibly reaching a new all-time high before undergoing a major correction. This structure follows a pattern of five waves that started from XRP’s low in 2013. If this plays out, a correction could follow, possibly pulling the price down to $0.40–$0.50, similar to past market behavior. 2. The White Scenario (Alternative) This scenario shows that the current bull market actually started in 2020, not 2013. XRP is possibly in the final wave of a smaller five-wave move. If true, a smaller but still significant correction could follow, possibly lasting up to a year. Despite the uncertainty, both scenarios expect another price increase, especially while XRP holds above the key support level of $1.20. If this happens, XRP could rise to $5.60 or even $6.60. Short-Term Outlook From a shorter-term perspective, XRP appears to be forming a five-wave move up from its April low. However, the pattern is not yet clear. If XRP stays above $2.12, prices could continue to rise. But if it drops below that level, we may see a correction with support between $1.84 and $2.10.",News|Altcoins|Crypto news|Price Analysis|Ripple (XRP),EN,0,0,ALTCOIN|MARKET|TRADING|XRP,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-05-02 03:01:35

April's on-chain data shows a decline in Bitcoin's Monthly Active Addresses, indicating a dwindling user base, partly due to ETF adoption. Bitcoin mining sector faces profitability challenges despite high BTC prices, with global hash rate growth and low fees impacting long-term security and decentralization. Gold has outperformed Bitcoin since 2021, but recent demand flow data suggests a potential capital rotation favoring Bitcoin in the short to medium term. My early-February call for 'beast mode ' in Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) and by extension the Fidelity Wise Origin Bitcoin Fund ETF ( FBTC ) was not well-timed. This was acknowledged later when I followed that piece up with a late-February article titled ""Turns Out, Bitcoin's Beast Was a Bear."" More recently, 'investor demand' for BTC has improved if ETF inflows are any indication. In this update, we'll look at April network data, the mining sector, and what (if any) relationship there is between Bitcoin and Gold ( XAUUSD:CUR ) that could foreshadow a larger capital rotation. On-Chain Data: April 2025 The on-chain metrics that I typically pay attention to when drawing my own assessment of Bitcoin's 'network health' are things like fees, daily active addresses, and transferred value. In April, Monthly Active Addresses came in at 10.9 million. This was flat month over month and down 14% year over year. Bitcoin DAAs vs MAAs (Token Terminal) The Token Terminal chart above shows Bitcoin user data expressed through both Daily Active Addresses (or DAAs) and Monthly Active Addresses (or MAAs). Though the trends are very similar, the MAA trend (green line) shows a peak in monthly active addresses in January 2021. Daily Active Addresses actually peaked in September 2023. The point is, we could easily argue Bitcoin is exhibiting a dwindling user base, since monthly unique addresses have been trending down through this halving cycle. Admittedly, some of this is due to 'adoption' taking place through ETFs rather than on-chain. We'll get into the ETF data in a later section. USD Transferred Value (CoinMetrics) At $9.9 billion in 30-day average transferred value, Bitcoin is still a highly functioning blockchain. However, the payment to miners for validating that transferred value continues to be underwhelming to say the least: Monthly Mining Fees (Token Terminal) At $15.7 million in fees for the month, April saw a 4% increase over March and a whopping 94% decline in full-month fees year over year. To be fair, April 2024 was the third-best month ever for Bitcoin miners from a fee-generation standpoint. But I can't stress enough that the lack of fees is a long-term problem for Bitcoin due to the limited supply of coins. Mining Industry Health It's easy to hand-wave away the importance of fees long term due to the fact that Bitcoin has always produced a new all-time high price following a halving event. In theory, the perpetual increase in the price of BTC offsets the reduction of fresh supply from block reward emissions. In reality, Bitcoin's price increase in this halving cycle arguably hasn't been enough to justify the global hashrate growth that we've seen since the halving in April 2024: Rewards USD vs BTC (mempool.space) The chart above shows Bitcoin mining rewards measured in both BTC (in yellow) and US dollars (in green). Yellow gets cut in half every four years. That matters less than the dollar-denominated rewards for miners, since mining expenses are denominated in fiat rather than BTC. A year after the halving in 2020, Bitcoin's dollar-denominated rewards were essentially at all-time highs. A year following the 2024 halving, Bitcoin's dollar denominated rewards are actually below that 2021 high. This wouldn't be as big of an issue for miners if the global hash rate was holding steady or even going down. The opposite is true: Data by YCharts Though it is admittedly off recent highs, Bitcoin's global hash rate has grown by 40% over the last twelve months. The result of which is a mining sector profitability figure that remains significantly depressed at just $49 per PHS/Day: Bitcoin Hashprice, 5 Year Trend (Hashrate Index) If you're looking for a reason why Bitcoin mining stocks are still well below their highs from the last cycle even with Bitcoin at $87k per coin, the chart above is a big part of your answer. To be sure, there are long-term implications to Bitcoin's security if mining can't be done profitability, and I'd wager one of those implications is the centralization of global hash. Consider that public mining companies can and have generally funded expansion through shareholder dilution rather than by efficiently running an operation. Smaller/private mining companies don't necessarily have that luxury. Unlike Gold, which does not require miners to exist for the movement/settlement of previously mined metal, Bitcoin's decentralized ledger does require validation from miners to create new blocks. This is one of the critical reasons why I don't think Bitcoin will overtake Gold in terms of market capitalization in my lifetime. But that doesn't mean the current setup can't favor Bitcoin for a capital rotation trade shorter to medium term. Rotation Trade Setup Gold has absolutely proven its value as a safe haven asset over the last three years. From the 2022 low to the 2025 high, Gold has more than doubled in price. For an asset with a multi-trillion market capitalization, this type of move in price is quite impressive. Gold has done so well since 2022, that we currently have a Bitcoin/Gold ratio that is below the 2021 peak of 36: Bitcoin/Gold Ratio (LongTermTrends.net) To be sure, this ratio did indeed make a new high of 40 in late 2024. But at the current 28 reading in the ratio, Gold has actually outperformed Bitcoin since November 2021. Even though Bitcoin has often been dubbed 'digital Gold,' the 30-day average correlation between the two had actually been negative for two straight months earlier this year. 30 Day Pearson (The Block) That has since reversed, and we currently find BTC and Gold with their tightest 30-day average correlation in 3 months. This comes with Gold beginning to show signs of temporary bull exhaustion and Bitcoin breaking out over technical resistance in late-April.

Once driven purely by internet culture and speculation, it now represents a complex trading environment with increasing institutional presence, data-driven strategies and measurable risk factors. In this market, individual traders often face diminishing returns. Narratives move faster than most can react to, and access to real-time data is now a minimum requirement. In 2025, successful participation in memecoin cycles requires not only infrastructure but also a clear framework for evaluating assets before engaging with them. The following metrics represent a baseline for assessing viability in today’s memecoin landscape. Whale and smart money wallet tracking – T he foundation of signal-based trading Large wallets – commonly referred to as whales – continue to serve as early indicators of sentiment shifts in the memecoin market. However, simply replicating their trades without looking at smart money trades has proven ineffective. Instead, data should be used to identify patterns of behavior. Wallets with a verifiable profit history over the past 30 days, ideally showing a 30–100% return on capital, tend to offer more reliable signals. Greater significance is typically assigned to those whose average trade size exceeds $5,000, suggesting a higher level of conviction. Tools that provide real-time monitoring of wallet activity can offer valuable context and alerts. Tokens that attract multiple large transactions – $30,000 and above – from such wallets within a short timeframe are more likely to reflect emerging trends, whereas isolated transactions may not be meaningful. This type of monitoring often provides a more accurate picture of market sentiment than technical indicators alone. Social attention – Without visibility, there’s limited traction For memecoins to gain traction, visibility remains a core requirement. A verified and active X account has become a minimum benchmark for credibility. While follower count is less important than engagement metrics, a baseline of consistent activity and community response indicates a functioning marketing effort – a n essential element in memecoin dynamics. Also, tracking the volume and velocity of social media mentions remains one of the most effective tools for early signal detection. Rather than focusing on absolute numbers, traders monitor acceleration – how quickly a token gains traction across platforms such as X, Telegram and Reddit. An emerging metric, velocity score, measures the rate of increase in mentions over short timeframes of approximately three-hour windows. Tokens showing sharp upward trends in social engagement often experience price movement shortly thereafter. Liquidity – C ritical to mitigating price manipulation Liquidity acts as a buffer against volatility. Low-liquidity coins may offer sharp upside during peak momentum but carry significantly higher downside risk. In 2025, experienced traders tend to avoid tokens with total liquidity below $150,000 unless paired with unusually high short-term volume and whale activity. As a general rule – $500,000 to $2 million liquidity represents a stable range for entry in mid-cap cycles. Pools above $5 million are less likely to deliver sharp price appreciation but provide higher security against slippage and coordinated manipulation. Token supply and holder distribution – A ssessing structural risk Tokens without clear developer burn mechanisms are increasingly viewed as unsustainable. If the founding team retains a significant portion of the supply and no verifiable burn events have occurred post-launch, long-term investor confidence is unlikely. Equally important is wallet concentration. In practice, a top 10 wallet group holding more than 20% of the total supply is viewed as a structural weakness. A more distributed supply generally correlates with reduced volatility and greater resilience to coordinated exits. Trading volume – A proxy for health and sustainability Consistent trading volume is essential for risk mitigation. In today’s environment, memecoins trading below $250,000 daily for more than 48 hours are generally considered inactive or abandoned. Conversely, volumes above $2 million indicate active cycles and more reliable liquidity across exchanges. And rising prices without matching volume tend to signal short-term exit activity rather than genuine interest. Understanding the game – T rading reflexivity, not fundamentals Unlike traditional assets, memecoins derive much of their value from reflexivity – the cycle of belief and price movement. That said, traders are buying tokens not for their intrinsic value but for the likelihood that others will buy after them. Success in this market depends on recognizing behavioral patterns, identifying when others will act and entering before broader momentum builds. Attempting this solo is increasingly ineffective. In 2025, the most competitive edge comes from collaboration – small trading groups with defined roles (on-chain analysis, social metrics, liquidity tracking, etc.) – outperform isolated participants consistently. Ultimately, memecoin trading has evolved into a highly specialized activity, demanding structured analysis, real-time infrastructure and shared insights. For those unwilling or unable to approach it at this level, passive exposure may be the more rational path.

At the moment, Bitcoin is trading just under $97,000. It recently broke through the $96,000 level and is showing signs of strength on the daily and weekly charts. Some price pullbacks are still expected, but the overall trend remains upward. Analysts are now watching closely for the next major price levels as this rally could drive the entire crypto market higher. In the second quarter of 2025, Bitcoin is showing strong bullish indicators. It recently cleared its 200-day moving average and is building strong support. Additional support levels at $95,797 and $96,441 are also being monitored as part of a broader bullish structure. According to an analyst, a sustained drop below $95,280 could signal the early stages of a larger correction, but as of now, Bitcoin remains firmly above that threshold. If buying pressure resumes, short-term targets to the upside include $97,325, $98,745, and the psychological milestone of $100,000. These levels represent areas of potential resistance based on recent price dynamics. The larger trend remains constructive, with bulls aiming for a continuation of the uptrend toward the $115,000–$120,000 range later this cycle—provided current support zones hold. Market Outlook: More Gains Ahead? The strong Bitcoin rally could push other cryptocurrencies like Ethereum, XRP, and Solana higher as well. This pattern, seen in past bull markets, usually starts with Bitcoin leading the way, followed by altcoins gaining momentum as investor money spreads across the market. While pullbacks are expected — since prices never go up in a straight line — many experts believe the market is setting up for another major run. A key support level to watch is $95,280. As long as Bitcoin stays above this, there’s a chance for more upside.",News|Bitcoin|Crypto news|Price Analysis,EN,0,0,ALTCOIN|BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|TRADING,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-05-02 03:41:04

In a written statement , the Commerce Ministry in Beijing said it had “taken note” that senior US officials have repeated their wish to speak with China about the tariffs. “The United States has recently sent messages to China through relevant parties, hoping to start talks with China,” the ministry said. “China is currently evaluating this.” The statement urged officials in the US capital to match their words with “sincerity.” The note gave financial markets fresh hope that the trade standoff between the world’s two largest economies might ease. Futures on the S&P 500 Index wiped out earlier losses during Asian hours, and a widely watched yardstick of regional shares moved into positive territory. Hong Kong’s Hang Seng China Enterprises Index climbed more than 1 percent, while mainland exchanges stayed shut for a holiday. In currency trading, the offshore yuan rose 0.3 percent to 7.2566 per dollar, and the Australian dollar extended its rebound. Talks would mark a shift in a dispute that has rattled businesses on both sides of the Pacific. Last month, Trump pushed import taxes on a broad range of Chinese goods to levels unseen in 100 years, and Beijing retaliated by raising its own tariffs. The U.S. president has said several times that Chinese leader Xi Jinping needs to contact him first if Beijing truly wants to bargain. Earlier this week, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent told reporters that China must take the initial step to break the stalemate. “The high level of reciprocal tariffs on China is not sustainable, so the market expects the U.S. and China to start negotiating at some point,” said Woei Chen Ho, economist at United Overseas Bank Ltd. “The beginning of negotiations will likely drive market volatility again because it is not expected to be plain sailing.” Political moves in Washington could complicate the path forward On Thursday, Trump reshuffled top national‑security posts, expanding Secretary of State Marco Rubio’s duties. Rubio, who became the first US cabinet member sanctioned by Beijing, will act as interim national security adviser while keeping his State Department portfolio. Michael Waltz, the outgoing adviser, will be nominated as US ambassador to the United Nations. Holding both jobs will give Rubio a louder voice on matters that Beijing follows closely, including Taiwan, which China regards as its own territory. The secretary of state has pledged in the past to counter what he calls China’s “destabilizing actions” in the South China Sea. In an interview broadcast Thursday night on Fox News with host Sean Hannity, Rubio said Chinese officials are looking for a “short‑term accommodation” and that the US duties are “taking a huge toll” on China’s economy. “The Chinese are reaching out,” Rubio told Hannity. “They want to meet, they want to talk.” Marco Rubio in a recent interview with Hannity on Fox News. Source: Fox News The White House, the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative, and the Departments of Treasury and Commerce did not answer requests for comment on Friday. Economic pressure inside China is mounting. The official manufacturing purchasing managers’ index released this week showed factory activity sinking into its deepest contraction since December 2023. New export orders fell to the lowest level since December 2022 and recorded their steepest one‑month drop since April 2022, when Shanghai shut down to control a pandemic outbreak. Even while hinting at openness, the Commerce Ministry framed its view as unchanged. As a condition for any talks, the ministry said Washington must first “correct its wrong practices” by lifting the unilateral tariffs. “If we fight, we will fight to the end; if we talk, the door is open,” the statement said. It said, “What China wants to emphasize is that in any possible dialogue or talks, if the United States does not correct its wrong unilateral tariff measures, it means that the United States has no sincerity at all and will further damage the mutual trust between the two sides.” Cryptopolitan Academy: Want to grow your money in 2025?

""The U.S. has proactively reached out to China through multiple channels, hoping to hold discussions on the tariff issue,"" China state media posted on social media . Dogecoin (DOGE) led gains among majors with a 4% rise in the past 24 hours. Cardano's ADA, XRP, ether (ETH) and BNB rose between 1-3%, with the broad-based CoinDesk 20 (CD20) rising 2.2%. Movement's MOVE extended losses to 21% as the company confirmed founder Rushi Manche had been suspended following a CoinDesk exposé of possible token manipulation involving the 21-year-old. On Polymarket, bettors are skeptical that a deal will come this month, giving it only a 20% chance of happening by June. Bettors are likely concerned that the hawkish rhetoric from the White House means a deal may take longer than a month to be reached. The speed and intensity of the tariffs the White House announced earlier this year panicked the market, leading to a significant drop in BTC's price, but with this apparent trade detente, $100,000 bitcoin is back on the agenda. Other crypto metrics are looking healthy, market observers say, putting $100K bitcoin in sight. ""Momentum continues to build across crypto with spot flows broadening, alt activity heating up and subtle but meaningful shifts in market structure,"" trading and technology group Flowdesk said in a recent market note. ""As BTC ranges above $90K, undercurrents of risk appetite are growing stronger within both spot and derivative markets. Liquidity remains strong with rising volumes, surging weekend activity, and improving altcoin depth. At the same time, broad-based spot buying continues, led by speculative alts and AI tokens, alongside $1.5B in Bitcoin ETF inflows as institutional demand grows,"" Flowdesk also wrote. The market is also likely optimistic about Strategy's continued BTC buys, and push towards further institutionalization. As CoinDesk recently reported , Michael Saylor announced that Strategy is raising $21 billion for more BTC buys. In a recent note , Presto Research said investors are increasingly impressed by Strategy’s growing institutional sophistication, highlighted by new valuation frameworks like BTC Torque and a strong focus on accurately pricing its fixed-income instruments. Kava milestone pushes AI tokens higher Artificial Intelligence (AI) tokens are in the green on Friday as the market reacts positively to news from Kava Labs that it hit 100K users of its decentralized AI platform. Data from CoinGecko shows the market segment is up 3%, beating the CoinDesk 20 , a measure of the performance of the largest digital assets, which is up by 1.8%. ""People are turning to Kava AI because it offers two things most platforms don’t, verifiability and privacy,"" Kava Labs' Scott Stuart said to CoinDesk in an email. ""That includes users who are deeply embedded in Web3 as well as those simply seeking an alternative to opaque, centralized AI systems."" Interest in Kava and decentralized AI growing globally, Stuart said, as more users recognize the value of AI that’s both decentralized and transparent, not reliant on a black-box model governed by a handful of corporations.",Markets|btc|Bitcoin|News,EN,0,0,ADA|ASIA|BTC|MARKET|TRADING,"{'name': 'CoinDesk', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/5/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coindesk,2025-05-02 05:04:57

A Long-Term Bitcoin Accumulation Strategy Outlined in its latest financial disclosure, TBG’s strategy focuses on an incremental acquisition approach. The company aims to increase its current holdings of 620 BTC to between 1,000 and 3,000 BTC by the end of this year. It has set an ambitious mid-term goal of owning 100,000 BTC by 2032 and hopes to reach between 170,000 and 260,000 BTC by 2034. “If Bitcoin reaches €1-2 million per coin by 2033-2035, holding 210,000 BTC could represent between €210 billion and €420 billion in net asset value,” the report states. This long-term vision is underpinned by a projection that Bitcoin’s value will appreciate substantially in the coming years. To measure progress, the company is tracking its proprietary “BTC Yield” metric, which saw a dramatic 709% increase in Q1 2025. During this period, its Bitcoin-per-share figure jumped from 41 to 332 satoshis. Strategic Backing and Funding Pipeline The firm, which trades under the ticker ALTBG on Euronext Growth Paris, underwent a strategic pivot in November 2024 to become a full-fledged Bitcoin Treasury Company. Since then, it has boosted its Bitcoin reserves significantly—from just 15 BTC in December 2024 to over 620 BTC by April 2025. The increase was achieved via equity placements and Bitcoin-denominated convertible bonds. TBG’s strategy has attracted support from well-known names in the crypto investment space, including Fulgur Ventures, UTXO Management, and TOBAM. Prominent cryptographer and Blockstream CEO Adam Back has also joined as a strategic advisor. Despite acknowledging the risks associated with the plan, the company maintains a clear goal: “accumulate as much BTC as possible, as fast as possible, in the most accretive way possible.” To fund this effort, TBG has projected a capital-raising potential ranging from €150 million to €100 billion over eight years, depending on market conditions and investor appetite. If the roadmap unfolds as planned, TBG could soon become Europe’s top corporate holder of Bitcoin. Share Price Soars in Six Months Since adopting its Bitcoin-focused model, TBG’s stock performance has mirrored other successful Bitcoin treasury firms. Its share price surged by 120% within the first month, 265% by the third month, and 474% after six months. This trend draws strong parallels to the early growth patterns of companies like Strategy and Metaplanet, both of which committed to the Bitcoin treasury model before TBG. “Bitcoin treasury companies are the fastest-growing companies in Europe,” TBG stated. Currently, Strategy remains the leading publicly listed corporate Bitcoin holder with 553,555 BTC—around 2.6% of the global circulating supply.",Bitcoin|Crypto News Today|Crypto Intelligence,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|BUSINESS|REGULATION|TRADING,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2025-05-02 05:21:12

FTM) Price Gearing Up—Will S (FTM) Price Reach $5 in 2025? appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News The Sonic price has triggered a strong upswing after trending lower for a couple of months and breaking out of its long-standing downtrend. The price is currently trading around $0.5595, with a massive rise of over 12% since the early trading hours, after stabilizing at a similar level during the past trading hours. The Sonic breakout was materialized after the star token, Bitcoin, displayed some strength and showed early signs of recovery. Now that the sentiments of the small-cap altcoins seem to have lifted, will the Sonic (prev. FTM) price reach $5 in 2025? The Sonic price is hovering just above its breakout zone, which has made the market participants extremely vigilant. A drop below the range may affect the bullish possibility for some time, but the chart patterns and the technicals suggest a strong rise could follow after a tight consolidation. The S price has reclaimed strength after testing support at $0.56 and is now trying to push back toward the $0.6 breakout zone. The daily chart of Sonic suggests there is a significant shift in the momentum where the bulls are trying to become dominant. The price is printing higher highs and lows, validating the rise if bullish strength. Meanwhile, the volume also appears to be in their favor, suggesting the price could remain elevated for the next few days. However, the technicals flash mixed signals, which raises concerns over the upcoming price action. The RSI is incremental, holding the ascending trend line, while the CMF has plunged heavily below 0 and is failing to rise above the descending trend line. This is a sign of weakness within the market, wherein the bears maintain their dominance. Meanwhile, the price continues to trade within an ascending triangle, and if it validates a rejection, a drop close to $0.5 could be imminent. However, the Sonic price is close to the apex of the triangle, and hence, a breakout from the pattern appears to be on the horizon. Therefore, the Sonic (prev. FTM) price may maintain a consolidated upswing and reach the edge at around $0.58. A rise above the range may push the levels above $0.6, which may attract some correction. Once done, the price could revive a strong upswing close to $0.8, which may further push the price into the final resistance below $1 at around $0.9. Surpassing these levels may attract fresh liquidity onto the platform and a rise may elevate the possibility of a new ATH.",Price Analysis|Altcoins,EN,0,0,ALTCOIN|BTC|FTM|MARKET|TRADING,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-05-02 05:24:29

The company just surpassed Wall Street estimates of $159.79 million by 1%. Riot’s Q1 revenue was a 50% jump compared to the same quarter a year ago. Riot blames “halving event” for expenses The firm reported a net loss of $296,367 over Q1, a 240% decrease from the $211,777 net income it posted in the year-ago quarter. Riot said that the average cost to mine Bitcoin ( BTC ) over the quarter was $43,808, almost 90% more than the $23,034 it cost to mine Bitcoin in the same period last year. “The increase was primarily driven by the block subsidy ‘halving’ event, which occurred in April 2024, and a 41% increase in the average global network hashrate as compared to the same period in 2024,” Riot said. Shares in Riot Platforms (RIOT) closed May 1 trading up 7.32%, trading at $7.77, according to Google Finance. Riot Platforms is down 13.47% over the past six months. Source: Google Finance Meanwhile, Riot produced 166 more Bitcoin during the quarter than it did over the same period in 2024.

The first, Ethereum R1, is a new tokenless layer-2 rollup designed to maintain decentralization and resist centralized control. The second initiative introduces ERC-7828 and ERC-7930 — two proposed token standards to standardize how blockchain addresses are displayed and interpreted across different chains. Ethereum Developers Launch R1 Rollup to Challenge L2 Status Quo Amid Fee Collapse and Governance Concerns An independent group of Ethereum developers has launched Ethereum R1, a tokenless layer-2 solution designed to preserve Ethereum’s core values of decentralization and neutrality — reigniting debate over the role and direction of Ethereum’s scaling ecosystem. A coalition of developers operating outside the Ethereum Foundation unveiled Ethereum R1 on May 1, positioning it as a “credible neutral” layer-2 (L2) rollup that rejects the trends of venture funding, token-driven incentives, and centralized governance that have become increasingly prevalent among L2 solutions. The initiative arrives at a critical juncture for Ethereum, where base layer revenues are collapsing, L2 networks are proliferating, and concerns are mounting over whether Ethereum's scaling roadmap is veering away from its original ethos. “General-purpose L2s should be commodities — simple, replaceable, and free from centralized dependencies or risky governance,” the team declared in an X post announcing the rollup. “Ethereum R1 is our answer to that call — the rollup grounded in credible neutrality, decentralization, and censorship resistance.” A Tokenless Alternative in a Token-Fueled Ecosystem What sets Ethereum R1 apart from other L2s is its uncompromising design philosophy. The developers behind the project have emphasized that R1 will not include a native token, will not accept venture capital, and will rely entirely on community donations to sustain itself. It also forgoes any form of governance token, an increasingly common element of L2 ecosystems that critics say concentrates decision-making power and financial incentives in the hands of a few stakeholders. This approach stands in sharp contrast to many of today’s L2s, such as Optimism and Arbitrum, which launched with sizable airdrops, foundation allocations, and VC participation. Critics argue that these tokenomics often skew incentives, creating L2s that behave more like standalone L1 blockchains rather than Ethereum-native scaling solutions. “Most L2s today are acting more like new L1s than an Ethereum scaling solution — private allocations, opaque governance, and centralized control,” the Ethereum R1 team wrote. Ethereum R1’s launch follows the Dencun upgrade in March 2024, which drastically lowered transaction fees across the Ethereum L2 landscape by introducing “blobspace” — a new data storage layer for rollups. While this achievement was hailed as a major step forward in improving user affordability and scaling potential, it came at a heavy cost to Ethereum’s base layer. According to data from Token Terminal, Ethereum’s base layer revenue collapsed by 99% by the end of Q1 2025, as most transactional activity migrated to cheaper L2s. In April 2025, average transaction fees on Ethereum fell to a five-year low of $0.16, sparking debates within the community about whether the base layer was being hollowed out in service of L2 expansion. Ethereum’s base layer revenue collapsed in Q1 2025 (Source: Token Terminal ) This has led to a paradox: while Ethereum is scaling efficiently through L2s, the financial sustainability of its L1 infrastructure is increasingly under scrutiny. Critics vs. Advocates: Is Ethereum Losing Its Base? The rise of token-centric L2s has also raised alarms over governance opacity, centralized sequencers, and economic extraction models that some view as antithetical to Ethereum’s founding principles. At the same time, proponents argue that Ethereum’s modular architecture — with L2s functioning as customizable execution environments — offers unparalleled flexibility and scalability. Anurag Arjun, co-founder of Avail, which builds unified chain abstraction solutions, said that Ethereum’s L2-centric approach “gives users a virtually unlimited number of high-throughput chains to choose from”, unlike monolithic chains that must scale vertically. Still, Ethereum’s decentralized community is split on the issue. One side views the proliferation of L2s as a necessary and powerful feature of Ethereum’s modular design. The other sees a creeping fragmentation — with incentives pulling developers and users away from Ethereum’s neutral and secure base layer. Ethereum R1: A Throwback or the Future? The Ethereum R1 project seems to deliberately position itself as a counterculture movement within the Ethereum ecosystem. By rejecting tokens, venture capital, and governance centralization, it harks back to early Ethereum values — namely, neutrality, censorship resistance, and decentralization as first principles, not afterthoughts. It’s unclear whether R1 will gain wide traction without the powerful economic incentives that token launches often provide. But its emergence signals a growing unease within the Ethereum community, and a hunger for alternatives that put ideology before investment returns. Ethereum Developers Push New Token Standards to Fix Cross-Chain Chaos Meanwhile, in a bid to bring order to Ethereum’s often chaotic multi-chain environment, a team of developers within the Ethereum ecosystem is rolling out two new token standards — ERC-7930 and ERC-7828 — aimed at improving blockchain interoperability and simplifying user experiences across decentralized applications and wallets. Announced in a May 1 post by Ethereum development organization Wonderland, the proposed standards are designed to bridge the gap between human users and blockchain protocols, ensuring that addresses and transactions can be easily interpreted and executed regardless of the chain in use. “There’s no standard way for wallets, apps, or protocols to interpret or display this information,” Wonderland wrote. “The result? A messy, inconsistent experience that breaks cross-chain UX.” Addressing Ethereum’s Interoperability Headache At the core of the issue is Ethereum’s growing Layer-2 and multichain ecosystem. While users can interact with networks like Optimism, Arbitrum, Base, and others using the same Ethereum-compatible address, those addresses often behave differently depending on the underlying chain infrastructure — leading to confusion, transaction errors, and even lost funds. Developers have long sought a standardized solution. The proposed ERC-7930 and ERC-7828 aim to do just that by creating a dual-layer addressing system: ERC-7930 introduces a machine-friendly binary format to ensure that protocols can seamlessly interpret addresses across all Ethereum-based chains. ERC-7828, meanwhile, provides a human-readable version using the format address@chain to help users clearly understand which blockchain they’re interacting with before executing a transaction. Together, the standards are designed to reduce friction and errors in the rapidly expanding Ethereum ecosystem. “Something for People, Something for Bots” During a recent interoperability working group call hosted by the Ethereum Foundation, Teddy from Wonderland explained that ERC-7828 is intended for any interface that interacts with users, while ERC-7930 is optimized for backend protocols and APIs. This dual-standard system aims to prevent users from accidentally sending assets to the wrong blockchain. It would allow wallets to be blockchain-agnostic, with the input field automatically determining the intended network based on the address format — a major improvement over the current requirement to manually switch networks in wallet settings. Wonderland emphasized the urgency of community feedback in their announcement. With plans to finalize the ERCs within two weeks, the team is calling on developers and ecosystem participants to review the proposals on the ETH-Magicians forum. “We badly need feedback on the ETH-Magicians forum,” Teddy said during the working group call. The standards are being developed in close collaboration with other major DeFi players, including Optimism, Aztec, Connext, and Yearn, all of whom have an active interest in improving the interoperability and user-friendliness of Ethereum's DeFi stack. Why This Matters for the Ethereum Ecosystem With the rise of Ethereum L2 networks and appchains, the need for standardization is becoming increasingly critical. Each new rollup or chain fragmenting the ecosystem adds complexity for both users and developers. Without a unified way to format and display addresses across chains, the user experience suffers — potentially driving adoption toward simpler, more vertically integrated alternatives. Many chains, one address is the ideal, but not without risk. Without clarity, users may send tokens to the wrong destination, losing funds or facing complex recovery processes. By offering both clarity for users and precision for machines, ERC-7828 and ERC-7930 seek to resolve one of Ethereum’s most pressing UX challenges. If widely adopted, they could lay the foundation for a more cohesive multi-chain experience within Ethereum — one where cross-chain operations feel as seamless as using a single network. The introduction of ERC-7930 and ERC-7828 marks a major step toward resolving Ethereum's cross-chain fragmentation. With backing from respected DeFi organizations and a clear focus on both usability and interoperability, these standards could become a cornerstone of Ethereum's evolving architecture.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|BUSINESS|ETH|ARB,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-05-02 05:30:00

While Shiba Inu (SHIB) is seeing renewed interest from whales and Cardano (ADA) is testing the strength of its breakout, both projects still depend heavily on speculative movement and trading patterns. In contrast, Dragoin presale crypto is building traction from the ground up through user interaction. Its Telegram-based Tap Game removes entry barriers and directly links gameplay to token rewards, offering both utility and potential upside. With a 6,700% ROI projected from its stage 2 presale, Dragoin is quietly positioning itself as the best crypto for payments through real engagement and accessibility. Dragoin’s Telegram Game Simplifies Crypto Earnings Dragoin is breaking new ground by making crypto earning as simple as tapping a screen. Unlike many projects that require complicated apps or wallet setups, Dragoin’s Telegram-based Tap Game allows users to start earning $DDGN tokens instantly by bursting balls. As a result, this frictionless approach significantly lowers the barrier for entry, making it highly attractive to new users seeking both entertainment and financial opportunity. Currently, in stage 2 of its presale, Dragoin offers early participants a rare chance to buy at just $0.0000335 per token. With a projected launch price of $0.002, early buyers are looking at a potential ROI exceeding 6700% when Dragoin lists on public exchanges. Therefore, this steep upside, paired with simple daily gameplay, positions Dragoin as a strong candidate for rapid adoption among casual users and crypto enthusiasts alike. Furthermore, the project’s approach to accessibility could also cement its place as one of the best crypto for payments in the future. By focusing on usability and daily earning mechanics, Dragoin is building a vibrant, active community before even hitting major trading platforms. Consequently, as players continue to earn Tap Points through the game, their connection to the $DDGN ecosystem strengthens, creating natural buying and holding pressure ahead of launch. Ultimately, those seeking a high-reward opportunity backed by real community participation may find Dragoin’s presale one of the most promising early entry points available today. With growth fueled by gameplay, community referrals, and scarcity from burned unsold tokens, Dragoin is setting the stage for an explosive debut. Shiba Inu (SHIB) Whale Activity Surges 90% Shiba Inu (SHIB) whale activity has spiked by 90%, signaling renewed interest from large holders. On April 21, major SHIB transactions totaled nearly $7.75 million, echoing similar patterns from late 2024 when whale movements preceded sharp price increases. Despite this, SHIB’s price has remained relatively flat, weighed down by a 30% drop in active addresses. This indicates a decline in retail engagement and suggests hesitation among smaller investors, even as whales quietly continue to buy. Notably, over 100 trillion SHIB tokens have been moved off exchanges, a clear indication that some whales are shifting toward long-term holding strategies. At the same time, the token faces resistance around the $0.0000129 level, a key price ceiling that capped April’s previous rally. If volume picks up and retail activity returns, SHIB could be positioned for another upward move. Cardano (ADA) Price Breakout Faces Test Cardano (ADA) recently confirmed a breakout above the $0.6440 level, forming a bullish pattern that hints at a potential 27% rally. This movement followed a symmetrical triangle formation and was backed by rising trading volume, suggesting growing trader interest. However, large holders offloaded over 180 million ADA between April 13 and 18, raising concerns about whether the price can maintain upward momentum. While the MACD remains in positive territory at 0.0063, the narrowing gap with its signal line signals weakening strength. Additionally, the Bull Bear Power indicator shows fading buying pressure. To sustain the current breakout, Cardano needs consistent volume support and positive investor sentiment. If price consolidation follows without sharp sell-offs, ADA could continue climbing. On the other hand, more large-scale selling might limit short-term gains. The coming sessions are expected to reveal whether ADA can hold above its breakout point or retreat to previous support levels. Dragoin Stands Out as the Best Crypto Shiba Inu and Cardano continue to capture attention through large-holder activity and price patterns, but Dragoin offers a different kind of value. Its direct connection between gameplay and earnings builds a daily habit among users, not just speculative hope. By removing friction and rewarding participation, Dragoin is creating a network of engaged holders even before hitting major exchanges. For those evaluating early-stage projects based on real usage potential and long-term utility, Dragoin presents a strong case. As adoption grows through its Tap Game, it may prove to be more than just a short-term gain and instead the best crypto for payments going forward.

Last around $2.22, the XRP price is currently holding just above its 21 and 50DMAs, around 38% above its April lows around $1.60. That impressive recovery comes as the broader crypto and US stock markets rally on hopes that US President Donald Trump is softening on his trade war stance, which could help the economy dodge a near-term crisis. However, US economic is increasingly pointing towards an impending recession, suggesting this optimism might be unfounded. And the XRP price could also face headwinds in wake of Franklin Templeton’s ETF application hitting a worrying roadblock. The SEC just delayed the decision until June 17th, per a Wednesday filing, and ETF analysts believe no decision may actually arrive until October. BREAKING: SEC DELAYS DECISION ON FRANKLIN TEMPLETON’S SPOT XRP ETF — NEW DEADLINE JUNE 17 The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has officially pushed its decision on the Franklin Templeton XRP Spot ETF to June 17, 2025, per a new filing published today. The… pic.twitter.com/inWewJeQVB — Diana (@InvestWithD) April 29, 2025 The implication is that “ETF hype” may not be a major narrative for XRP until the final quarter of the year. And with macro conditions seemingly worsening, despite Trump backing off from his trade war, XRP’s rally is at risk of becoming unstuck. XRP Price Prediction – Where Next? Taking a look at the XRP chart, the cryptocurrency appears to be in the process of forming a bullish flag pattern over the past few months. The current fundamental backdrop suggests a major near-term breakout of this pattern, say, in May, is unlikely. If the rally does continue, it may struggle to get past $2.50 and the price could easily slip back to the lower bounds of its recent trend channel. A return to sub-$2.0 levels may be on the card in the coming months, before an eventual major breakout comes later in the year, in sync with the approval of spot XRP ETFs by the US SEC . A better crypto to buy now for near-term gains might be a promising new Solana project called Solely (SOLX) , which has caught the attention of the web3 community with its impressive presale that’s raked in over $32 million so far.

Solaxy is the first Layer-2 solution for the Solana blockchain, designed to address network congestion and enhance scalability. By processing transactions off-chain and using rollups, Solaxy ensures faster, cheaper transactions while maintaining Solana’s security. With its massive presale haul, a 125% APY staking program and a growing community of over 70,000 followers, Solaxy is gaining major traction. Its no surprise then that some analysts are predicting a 10x return by the end of 2025, driven by Solana’s surging DeFi activity and Solaxy’s innovative infrastructure. As Solana’s ecosystem expands, Solaxy’s utility and potential make it a top crypto investment now.

Yet, even as the downturn persists, many in the market can only wonder whether this is a push toward a potential bounce or, instead, an ongoing downturn where Ethereum settles into something like the price it hit in 2016. The price of Ether (ETH) just doesn’t seem to want to go any higher, and in the face of new low after new low, some can’t help but think that this is a new situation for Ethereum. $ETH closed its 5th red month in a row. It’s been rough — but not a knockout. Is this the quiet before a bounce… or the setup for more pain? Hard to say, but one thing’s clear: all eyes are on what ETH does next. pic.twitter.com/Ioz4nbGXpi — Kyledoops (@kyledoops) May 1, 2025 For those closely watching Ethereum’s market behavior, some indicators suggest this might not be the downward spiral it appears to be. Ethereum’s exchange supply ratio has recently plunged to levels not seen in weeks, suggesting that ETH is being withdrawn from exchanges at an alarming rate. So is this bad news for Ethereum? Not really, because what we want to see, as ETH holders and Ethereum fans, is ETH leaving exchanges. In fact, the entirety of the Ethereum network is becoming increasingly devoid of ETH. Ethereum’s exchange supply ratio just plunged to multi-week lows. When this happens: ETH leaves exchanges → selling pressure drops → supply tightens → price squeezes. Binance is the liquidity hub. This isn’t small talk — it’s signal. Keep an eye on $ETH flows. pic.twitter.com/D4U70iG4fj — Kyledoops (@kyledoops) May 1, 2025 Yet, quantifying these effects is difficult, and making accurate calls on Ethereum’s near-term price movements is even trickier, given several big-picture variables at play: – Regulatory clarity for the crypto sector is still a long way off. – Institutional interest and investment keeps rising. – The state of the overall economy—whether in crypto or fiat—matters a lot. Ethereum’s Exchange Supply Ratio and What It Could Mean for the Price In recent weeks, one of the most notable shifts in Ethereum’s market activity has been the dramatic decline in its supply-to-exchange ratio. This indicator measures the amount of ETH held on exchanges relative to the overall circulating supply. When the ratio drops, it means that fewer ETH tokens are available on exchanges to buy. Of course, this is a very simplistic explanation, but the idea here is that if you have fewer tokens available to buy, that’s good for the price because we know that buyers need to come in at this level to keep the price going up. In the past, when low levels of exchange supply ratio were seen on Ethereum, those conditions were followed by upward price movements. This current consolidation pattern we are in may very well set up for the next potential bounce to the upside. All the while, as more and more ETH gets removed from exchanges, the already reduced supply in the hands of traders and short-term speculators grows ever more worrisome for those looking to keep the price of ETH down. While this indicator is certainly bullish, it does not guarantee that immediate price action will occur. The markets are too volatile for that. They are influenced by all sorts of events and developments beyond just technical indicators. So, one needs to keep in mind the potential influence of broader market sentiment, regulatory developments, and just good old supply-and-demand appetite on the price of Ether. Ethereum Spot ETFs: Outflows and Inflows Reflect Market Sentiment Another important aspect for the immediate future of Ethereum lies in how well Ethereum spot ETFs perform. As of April 30, the total net amount flowing into Ethereum spot ETFs was nearly $2.36 million, but with a few more numbers, that might read as: Institutional interest in Ethereum has definitely cooled. Investors are probably reducing their exposure to Ethereum—if not outright selling—that might be due to concerns over recent Ethereum performance and precision or a lack of investor confidence in the overall cryptocurrency market. Yet, not every Ethereum ETF had outflows. Fidelity’s Ethereum ETF (FETH) was among the very few to manage net inflows during that stretch. Does this mean some institutional players are pulling back from crypto while others are still confident in Ethereum’s long-term prospects? Or is it the case that FETH’s net inflows are simply a sign of price weakness around which smart institutional money (aka, hedge funds) is maneuvering to set up what it hopes will be a buying opportunity? On April 30, Bitcoin spot ETFs saw a total net outflow of $56.23 million, with BlackRock’s IBIT being the only fund to record a net inflow. Ethereum spot ETFs had a total net outflow of $2.36 million, with only Fidelity’s FETH posting a net inflow. https://t.co/Hj2Gs49bWa — Wu Blockchain (@WuBlockchain) May 1, 2025 The Ethereum spot ETF market reflects the mixed sentiment and broader uncertainty of ETH’s short-term future. There is certainly still institutional support for ETH, but the lack of inflows that are rising to the level of significant has to raise, at the very least, some eyebrow among proponents of Ethereum as to what larger players are seeing that is making them hesitate in committing capital. Looking Ahead: A Period of Uncertainty with a Potential for Upside Ethereum’s five straight months of losses are definitely worrisome, but the clear decrease in its exchange supply ratio and the spot ETF situation (which is somewhat amazing) indicate that the present market milieu is not entirely gloomy. Definitely, the reduction in selling pressure and imminent supply-tightening could lead to a prospective price squeeze that might also work in Ethereum’s favor. This potential for a bounce will depend heavily on several external factors. Continued macroeconomic uncertainty, regulatory developments, and overall market sentiment are very important in determining whether Ethereum can regain its upward momentum. The question is: can Ethereum finally break its losing streak and surge higher, or will the broader market conditions keep it trapped in a downward spiral? For both traders and investors, the next few weeks are going to be very important for determining the fate of Ethereum. The ETH leave exchange trend we have seen recently is a positive sign; however, it still remains to be seen if this will be enough to counter the larger market headwinds we are facing. As we know, the crypto world is always stupidly volatile and absurdly uncertain, so any price predictions must be taken with a whole grain of salt.

After skimming perilously close to a low of $74,901, the token’s worth had not seen anything lower since 2025, it bounced back hard. A 14.7% surge in the asset’s price took it back up to more optimistic levels, and even a recent spate of negative Bitcoin news couldn’t keep the asset down. The rebound, which many are now calling a ”rally,” was sparked by something that is quite common in finance: the easing of concerns over macroeconomic conditions. Bitcoin Gained 14.7% in April $BTC climbed 14.7% in April, recovering from a sharp early-month decline that pushed the price to $74,901, the lowest level so far in 2025.

A whole set of important elements that could act as price movers one way or another are now at play. And from these, three distinct scenarios have emerged that could shape the next phase of Bitcoin’s market performance. In short, will it keep going up, or face a near-term correction? The answer depends on a variety of things, but mostly on macroeconomic conditions and on-chain metrics.

The rally has… pic.twitter.com/AlPFIjkjQx — CryptoRank.io (@CryptoRank_io) April 30, 2025 Three Scenarios for Bitcoin’s Next Rally As Bitcoin moves further into May, analysts are outlining three possible scenarios that could dictate its price action in the coming months. The first scenario is the most optimistic: a bull market. According to on-chain data, Bitcoin’s momentum is currently in what is termed the “start rally” zone, with a ratio of approximately 0.8, or 80%. Should the on-chain ratio break through 1.0 and hold above it, Bitcoin could experience a significant price increase, with targets reaching between $150,000 to $175,000. This would mirror previous cycles observed in 2017 and 2021, where Bitcoin experienced substantial rallies. In this scenario, the NUPL (Net Unrealized Profit/Loss) and MVRV (Market Value to Realized Value) metrics would likely show a new impulse, signaling a bullish continuation. The second, and more probable, scenario is consolidation. If the on-chain momentum remains in the 0.8 to 1.0 range, Bitcoin’s price could enter a wide trading corridor between $90,000 and $110,000. In this scenario, market participants would hold their positions but not significantly increase exposure, leading to a more stable, yet stagnant, market. While this would allow for some growth, it would not trigger a parabolic rise like the previous bull run scenarios. Finally, the worst-case scenario entertains the notion of a correction. Should Bitcoin’s on-chain ratio slip beneath 0.75, we could see the short-term holders take profits, thus pushing us down further into the $70K to $85K range (if we even hit that range). This is another unlikely occurrence given that we already had a pretty decent-sized correction earlier this year. Bitcoin is warming up: Three scenarios that could shape the next rally “As of today, the on-chain momentum is in the 'start' rally zone (Ratio ≈ 0.8 / 80%). Let's examine three scenarios for the next six months: 1.

The total net outflow of the Bitcoin spot ETFs on April 30 amounted to $56.23 million, which indicates a somewhat adverse shift in the institutional sentiment surrounding Bitcoin. Nevertheless, during this apparent downturn, one notable exception was BlackRock’s Bitcoin ETF, known as IBIT. IBIT was the only fund in the Bitcoin ETF universe that experienced any kind of net inflow during the observed period. On April 30, Bitcoin spot ETFs saw a total net outflow of $56.23 million, with BlackRock’s IBIT being the only fund to record a net inflow. Ethereum spot ETFs had a total net outflow of $2.36 million, with only Fidelity’s FETH posting a net inflow. https://t.co/Hj2Gs49bWa — Wu Blockchain (@WuBlockchain) May 1, 2025 The capital outflow from Bitcoin spot ETFs could have a variety of sources, including that of some investors taking profits after having built up positions in Bitcoin during its earlier price rallies. The very recent withdrawal may also be a reflection of the kind of investor caution you would expect to see ahead of an uncertain big economic or regulatory event. Bitcoin’s Resilience and Future Outlook Binary options trading is a unique and highly popular means of trading in the global financial markets. Unlike traditional options trading, which requires the trader to make complex calculations based on various parameters to determine the potential profitability of a trade, binary options trading requires very little understanding of the market or the forms of profit involved. In fact, the only condition necessary for a trader to successfully engage in binary options trading is the ability to correctly predict whether an option will end up “in the money” (profitable) or “out of the money” (not profitable) at the time of expiration. The larger market is still coping with the change in the economic tide, but the Bitcoin price it seems is signaling the next big bull run could well be underway. The trader and investment community will, of course, be watching not just the price of Bitcoin but the on-chain metrics, ETF movements, and the broader economic landscape for signs of the cryptocurrency’s next big price move. In any case, right now, several things Bitcoin could do in the next few months look very promising indeed. Disclosure: This is not trading or investment advice.

And despite the ECSO level of these projects, Virtuals has gained not only market cap but also a level of influence and mindshare within a rapidly expanding sector that is all taking to the air. Virtuals Ecosystem Surges Ahead Amid Growing Sector Interest As of May 1, 2025, the market cap of Virtual is a solid $1.94 billion, which is 18% up just in the last 24 hours. The growth of the ecosystem can be largely attributed to the surging demand for AI agents—intelligent digital entities that can interact with the blockchain and carry out various tasks. Virtuals is one of the best projects in space when it comes to AI agents. The token price of $VIRTUAL has experienced an outstanding upsurge, hitting $1.6601, which signals an exciting 23.8% increase within a single day. This rise is not a mere one-off occurrence; it follows a consistently strong showing from this token, which is now riding the wave of hinterland project development and sector-wide growth. Without a doubt, this strong figure places Virtuals among the leading players in the AI-agent space. One of the key reasons for Virtuals’ recent success is its continued dominance in the market and in the minds of consumers. Virtuals has claimed 19.9% of the total mindshare in the AI-agent sector, increasing by 1.33% in the last 24 hours. This reflects an almost daily increase in the interest and recognition of Virtuals’ ecosystem, as it has become almost daily fodder for conversation among developers, consumers, and investors who have decided to turn and take a closer look at the project and its almost daily progress. Microcaps Explode: Top Performers Lead the Charge The growth of virtuals is not happening in isolation. The broader AI-agent market is experiencing an explosive expansion of its own, with some microcap projects seeing amazing price movements in just the past 24 hours. Among the top gainers, MONK (@monk_agent) has seen an unbelievable 150.9% price increase, while MISATO (@Misato_virtuals) has been up by an impressive 76.2%. Other standouts include PTAI (@pilot3ai), which has shot up by 60.5%, and DORA (@xDora_ai), which saw an amazing 49.8% increase in value. All of this points to just how much interest there is right now in AI-powered virtual agents and the awesome potential of this game-changing sector. Virtuals Daily Update | May 1st 2025 Stay up to date on all developments from the @virtuals_io ecosystem over the last 24 hours… pic.twitter.com/fpDzv80OnG — Graeme (@gkisokay) May 1, 2025 Even with the astronomical growth of these smaller projects, Virtuals keeps a dominant role and presence in the ecosystem. Its continued strength in price action, liquidity, and mindshare has virtually ensured it leads the league in AI-agent adoption. With a seemingly nonstop focus on developing an ecosystem that features community-driven elements, top-notch partnerships, and cutting-edge tech, however, Virtuals appears to be taking a well-placed lead in this unfolding narrative of AI agents. A sign of the increasingly diverse world of the AI-agent sector is the fast ascent of microcap projects. While new players are always entering the fray, competition is sure to become more intense. With its early dominance, however, Virtuals is better positioned to solidify a foothold in this space. Looking Ahead: Virtuals Set to Dominate the AI-Agent Landscape The AI-agent market is ever expanding, and now all eyes are on Virtuals. It is steadily asserting itself as one of the key players in the space. With a growing market cap, a significant amount of mindshare, and a price of $VIRTUAL that is moving in the right direction, the project looks well-positioned to continue being part of the AI-agent conversation in the months ahead. The current market trend indicates that AI-driven projects will continue to be a major point of interest in the blockchain and crypto sectors. As this space develops further, and as new applications of AI in crypto are found, Virtuals’ capability to both keep up with and push to the front of such innovations will directly impact its standing as a provably major player in web3. Currently, both investors and enthusiasts are watching closely and with optimism the ongoing growth of Virtuals. They seem destined to enjoy the same good fortune that has already befallen the likes of ChatGPT, DALL-E, and other generative AIs. With solid fundamentals and a crystal-clear marketing strategy, Virtuals appears also to be our next bet on an AI agent that really might not only work but also be widely used across the industry at large.

In a May 1 blog post , the Sui Foundation announced that it will integrate sBTC and support the Stacks ( STX ) network, expanding its Bitcoin ( BTC ) DeFi capabilities. sBTC is a Bitcoin-backed asset developed by Stacks, a Bitcoin layer-2, and allows users to use their BTC in DeFi without relying on centralized custodians. As part of the integration, Sui ( SUI ) will also operate a validator on the Stacks network. The goal is to unlock DeFi opportunities like lending, borrowing, and trading for BTC holders, on a high-performance chain built for scale. “For too long, BTC has been treated as a passive asset. sBTC on Sui means holders can earn yield, participate in DeFi, and stay true to Bitcoin’s trustless ethos—all on Sui, a blockchain built for performance and scale.” — Adeniyi Abiodun, Mysten Labs co-founder With more than $6.5 billion currently locked in Bitcoin DeFi protocols, demand for BTCfi is rapidly increasing. Sui offers a scalable execution layer, while sBTC offers a decentralized method of meeting this demand. Its object-based architecture and parallel transaction processing make it an attractive platform for building DeFi apps.

Data from the last week indicate that well over 80,000 individual traders have made their way back to the platform, making this the highest level of activity seen since at least April. This resurgence not only seems to be propelling OpenSea back into the territory of user favor but also appears to be hinting at a more general return of NFT enthusiasm, particularly across several layer-2 ecosystems. @opensea is having a strong week, with over 82K traders in the past 7 days. Recent spikes on @arbitrum , @base , and @blast are driving momentum – showing where NFT interest is heating up.

One of the primary catalysts behind this uptick is surging activity across several Ethereum layer-2 networks, particularly Arbitrum, Base, and Blast. These chains have become fertile ground for NFT experimentation due to their lower gas costs and fast transaction speeds—boosting trading, minting, and gaming applications to an almost ideal platform level. OpenSea’s renewed focus on attempting to expand its presence across these ecosystems seems to be paying dividends. Arbitrum and Base have both seen exhibition increases in NFT volume and community engagement, as new collections and incentivized drops attract waves of fresh participants. Meanwhile, Blast—an emerging player in the L2 space—is quickly gaining traction, aided by its native rewards system and tight integration with NFT applications. The result is a significant migration of traders back to OpenSea, where these assets are increasingly being listed and flipped. For a significant part of the NFT community, the relationship between OpenSea and the rapidly expanding L2s of Ethereum is, more than anything, a relationship of convenience. The trading experience in these environments is more efficient, far less accessible than at some not-too-distant points in Ethereum’s past, and—as a delightful side effect—much less expensive than what trading on Ethereum mainnet costs at present or even at any time over the last year. OS 2.0 Beta and SEA Token Hype Add to the Surge Despite being a main layer driving activity, the beta launch of OpenSea 2.0 is actually the chief instigator of the latest uptick in user engagement. This long-awaited revamp offers a remodeled look, a speedier trading engine, and better analytics. Oh, and it also promises users on-chain rewards. All in all, it should help restore OpenSea’s dominance as the layer-2 landscape lavishes it with attention. Individuals taking part in the OS 2.0 beta are presently raking in rewards, with a number of SB users now doing so for the better part of a couple of months. And why, you might ask? Because we hear concerns from OpenSea that users might lose out on potential future Sea Token airdrops if they aren’t using the platform. And in quite the eerie coincidence, SB users have also heard from OpenSea in DMs recently, inviting them to partake in a user behavior study. Why not use the platform “as much as possible, for as many different types of things as you can,” we were told. In a nutshell, take OpenSea’s concerns as an incentive to keep using the platform and possibly grab a few future rewards in the process. These mechanics are a direct reflection of the way taken by other prosperous Web3 platforms that have capitalized on airdrop speculation and reward farming to ignite activity and loyalty. With each passing day, as more users rush to test OS 2.0 and push their on-chain interactions to the limit, OpenSea seems to be getting the windfall that comes from a virtuous cycle of usage and visibility. A Return to Relevance in the Evolving NFT Landscape Throughout a large part of 2023 and early 2024, OpenSea has suffered not only a declining market share but also the growth of a narrative that it has so far been too slow to innovate. This is despite the fact that, in some areas, OpenSea used to be the market leader (and still is, in number of users and volume, if not in reputation). Meanwhile, aggressive incentives from competitors like Blur have diverted some trading activity. Currently, the OS 2.0 beta is out, and there is strong engagement from users across the various L2 blockchains. This is a good sign, and it shows that OpenSea has found its footing again—at least for now. The big question remains, though: How sustainable is this momentum? Can OpenSea continue to support emerging artists, as it promises to do, and is it really going to unleash a SEA token that (in my mind) needs to be a game-changer for it to be worthwhile? What is now clear is that OpenSea is no longer sitting still in the background; it is reestablishing itself as a main player in the NFT ecosystem, propelled by an exciting new direction and a vibrant, growing user base.

While the administration’s approach has so far been more cautious than some of Trump’s campaign rhetoric promised, several meaningful steps suggest a more crypto-friendly federal landscape. From symbolic actions to institutional groundwork, the early days of Trump’s crypto policy are already reshaping expectations for how digital finance might evolve under his leadership. A Pro-Crypto Cabinet and a Symbolic National Reserve One of the most remarkable actions happened early in Trump’s presidency when he appointed a number of pro-crypto individuals to top regulatory and advisory roles. With this move, the administration is clearly trying to instill a foundation of sorts—logic would have it either for a basis to operate on or to point to with pride in the imminent future—for not-so-hostile frameworks and policies around digital assets. At a minimum, this effect could give some agencies, like the SEC, the courage to work with the industry instead of just shoving them under the bus. The appointments happened across all the relevant agencies, so it can’t be written off as a crypto-friendly faction in just one agency. Here’s a quick rundown of the appointments. In another headline-making turn of events, the Trump administration declared that it was setting up a national crypto reserve. The idea of a federal reserve of digital assets isn’t entirely new but had never before received the official imprimatur of the White House. A crypto reserve, as proposed, would put the United States in a world where sovereign states are increasingly engaging with digital currencies, both as an economic asset and a geopolitical tool. Nevertheless, Trump fell short of some of the more aggressive measures that crypto advocates hoped for. For one, there are no plans as of yet to direct any taxpayer dollars into what are essentially private investment vehicles. Working through new partnerships with the private sector, the reserve will instead utilize alternative mechanisms. In an administration that has thus far sought to downplay its investment in Bitcoin and other major cryptocurrencies, this is as much a signal of intent as anything else. And certainly, it’s a way of building credibility and, hopefully, avoiding controversy. Key Crypto Milestones from Trump’s First 100 Days Trump’s first 100 days in office have been eventful for the crypto industry. Staying true to his campaign promises, he has taken notable steps in support of crypto, including appointing pro-crypto leaders to key federal agencies,… pic.twitter.com/VyOB87Z5XQ — CryptoRank.io (@CryptoRank_io) April 30, 2025 White House Crypto Summit Marks a Cultural Shift Maybe the most symbolic gesture thus far is hosting the inaugural White House Crypto Summit. The event brought together key figures from the blockchain industry and federal agencies to discuss the future of decentralized technologies in the U.S. economy. The summit did not yield any immediate policy declarations; however, it was marked by an unprecedented level of engagement between the federal government and the crypto sector. The summit underscored many of the themes that have long resonated in and been championed by the crypto community, including responsible innovation and the need for modernized regulation in order to maintain the United States’ edge in global competitiveness. It also served as a direct way for industry stakeholders to express their top concerns to those in charge of the relevant federal agencies. For many, this event felt like a watershed moment, cementing the serious and sober national interest in the topic of digital assets. Market Reaction: Bitcoin Outperforms Amid Equity Volatility The crypto market has reacted favorably, even if the administration has adopted a cautious tone. Bitcoin, especially, has shown some real resilience to and upward momentum, even as the traditional markets have started to wobble under the weight of President Trump’s aggressive tariff policies. The contrast between a digital asset market that seems to be strengthening and an equities market that seems to be correcting has done nothing to dull investor interest in Bitcoin as a hedge against broader uncertainty in the economy. Although many in the cryptocurrency sector had hoped for more daring regulatory reforms or direct government investment in digital assets, the market seems to appreciate Trump’s early moves for the symbolism and direction they provide. This cautious optimism has helped maintain a bullish sentiment, especially among institutional investors who prize the kind of policy stability and regulatory clarity that seem to have been ushered in by the Trump administration. With Trump having moved beyond his first 100 days, sharp focus is now cast on just how these early foundations will be built upon. Will the administration back its symbolic gestures with truly substantive policy? And will regulatory clarity improve under the supposed guidance of pro-crypto appointees? These are the questions, kids, that will go a long way toward shaping the crypto market’s trajectory for the rest of Trump’s term. Disclosure: This is not trading or investment advice.

However, all eyes are now on the looming psychological barrier at $100K, a critical level that could either trigger profit-taking or act as a springboard toward new all-time highs. Technical Analysis By ShayanMarkets The Daily Chart BTC’s recent breakout above the decisive $95K resistance marks a key technical and psychological victory for the bulls. Following a brief consolidation period around this level, renewed buying pressure drove the price firmly higher, signaling the continuation of the bullish trend that began after the correction phase earlier this year. This breakout is a notable bullish development, as the $95K level had previously capped Bitcoin’s advances and aligned with prior swing highs. However, the focus now shifts to the $100K resistance zone, a round number that historically carries significant psychological weight. It is likely to be filled with latent sell orders, take-profit triggers, and institutional distribution, all of which could temporarily stall or reverse upward momentum. If bulls manage to breach this psychological barrier decisively, it would likely result in a strong continuation rally, with the next logical target being Bitcoin’s all-time high at $109K. The 4-Hour Chart On the 4-hour timeframe, Bitcoin initially paused at the $95K resistance, forming a sideways consolidation structure indicative of supply absorption. However, this consolidation was short-lived, as new demand flooded the market, resulting in a clean breakout above $95K, confirming buyers’ dominance and the validity of the prior breakout. Despite the strength of this move, the $100K mark now stands as the next major challenge. This level not only aligns with psychological resistance but also coincides with a prior major swing high, increasing its technical relevance. Should BTC fail to overcome $100K on its first attempt, profit-taking and smart money distribution could trigger a rejection and a corrective pullback toward the $90K support zone, where the 100 and 200-day moving averages currently provide structural reinforcement. Alternatively, the more probable short-term scenario is a consolidation phase below $100K, allowing the market to accumulate momentum before a potential breakout toward the $109K ATH. On-chain Analysis By Shayan The Taker Buy/Sell Ratio is a key on-chain metric that measures the ratio of market buy orders to market sell orders on exchanges such as Binance. In the latest reading, the Taker Buy/Sell Ratio has spiked sharply, reaching the highest level observed within the recent months. This surge suggests that market participants are increasingly executing market buy orders, reflecting a shift from passive accumulation to aggressive entry at market prices. Such behaviour typically occurs when investors and traders are confident in an imminent price increase or fear missing out on a rally, classic signs of strong bullish sentiment. The spike on the ratio chart highlights an influx of taker buy volume, confirming that buyers are actively chasing price, rather than waiting for lower entries. This behavioural shift often precedes strong upward momentum in price action, especially when coupled with rising open interest and positive price structure.

Several crypto projects are scheduled to unlock new tokens worth in excess of $4.59 billion—across the board, this is a pretty good number. But in this case, there’s one standout event, which is that WhiteBIT Coin ($WBT) is unlocking a staggering 1.15 billion tokens. This is by far the biggest single event in May in terms of supply change. And with unlocking new supply of this magnitude, naturally, our attention turns to what impact it might have on price, sentiment, and liquidity. WhiteBIT Coin Leads the Emissions Chart This month’s main unlock concerns $WBT, the native token of the prominent centralized exchange WhiteBIT. A total of 39.5 million $WBT tokens, worth around $1.15 billion, are being released into the market. This huge influx comes from WhiteBIT Funds 2, a multi-purpose allocation that serves several strategic functions nestled within the WhiteBIT ecosystem. May 2025 Supply Release: $4.59 Billion in New Token Supply This month, over $4.5B in new supply enters the market led by a notable unlock from $WBT (WhiteBIT Coin) 39.5M $WBT will be released, valued at ~$1.15B This release comes from WhiteBIT Funds 2 a multi-purpose… pic.twitter.com/EHJY0jLxLR — Tokenomist (prev. TokenUnlocks) (@Tokenomist_ai) April 30, 2025 As per WhiteBIT, the fresh tokens will serve multiple purposes: enhancing the liquidity of the platform; strengthening treasury reserves; boosting platform ecosystem growth; providing user incentives; rewarding team members; and increasing platform security. WhiteBIT is not alone in this approach, but it serves as a prime example of a crypto platform undertaking a token distribution exercise. WhiteBIT has diversified the allocation of these tokens, and while it is impossible to determine the direct effect of this on the market, it is part of a long-term user engagement strategy. Even with stated intentions, such a large token release is bound to cause unrest. Historically, when this many tokens have been unlocked, the selling pressure has ramped up. And if most of these tokens land in the hands of secondary-market traders, that pressure will almost certainly escalate. Of course, the big question is: How many tokens will the wallets associated with the exchange and the on-chain activity of the exchange itself be responsible for? And what’s going to happen to them? Market Implications and Trader Sentiment The May unlocks are particularly significant because of the scale and the timing. They coincide with a not very stable market. The crypto market seems to be recovering a little after a very turbulent first quarter, but we’ve seen in the past that the unlocking of large quantities of tokens can push prices down. So, natural price finding mechanisms, right? If there’s not organic demand for a token, if it’s not a Bitcoin, Ethereum, or a stablecoin, then just the addition of $4.59 billion in circulating supply could present some headwinds. And even some of those names—like a Litecoin, for instance—right now, we’re looking at a situation where just the sheer introduction of that much supply could push prices down. Both retail and institutional traders are now paying closer attention to tokenomics. This is especially true when it comes to matters like emissions schedules and lock-up periods. Retail and institutional traders both are now paying closer attention to tokenomics. This is especially true when it comes to emissions schedules and lock-up periods. The fact that $WBT makes up such a large portion of this month’s total unlocks makes it a high-risk, short-term speculation opportunity. And yet, long-term holders can find some comfort in WhiteBIT’s positioning of the unlock as a strategic growth opportunity. Key in the coming weeks will be the interpretation by the market of WhiteBIT’s use of the released funds. If these tokens are deployed effectively to increase user acquisition, incentivize liquidity, and expand platform features, the long-term benefit could outweigh the short-term dilution concerns. Conversely, if large amounts are sold into the market or moved to exchanges, $WBT could experience notable downward pressure. A Broader Look at Token Supply Trends Although this month’s headlines are dominated by WBT, it is only one of many tokens that are part of May’s total emission of $4.59 billion. Scheduled unlocks across the crypto sector are becoming much more of a talking point; much more a closely scrutinized feature of the tokens that trade in the crypto culture. What this means is that we can now much more easily see what risks are being taken on scheduled unlocks across the crypto sector. And if we can see it, then traders, analysts, and the communities part of the various protocols can see it too. May’s figure counts among the highest monthly totals recently seen. It comes as a critical moment for the market. More and more projects are nearing the end of their vesting schedule and are unlocking long-held reserves. Projects of this sort are introducing a good number of tokens to the market. Supply and demand are becoming much more vital to watch. Currently, the most significant event is the unlocking of WhiteBIT Coin, which is worth $1.15 billion. This situation offers us a chance to gauge how the market might respond to a huge emission of tokens in a somewhat maturing crypto sphere. In my mind, this makes WhiteBIT Coin somewhat of a test case. Disclosure: This is not trading or investment advice.

The acquisition also happened as Kraken gears up for an initial public offering in early 2026 and is exploring a debt package of between $200 million and $1 billion to support the move. In crypto, an Initial Public Offering (IPO) refers to when a crypto company—like an exchange or blockchain firm—lists its shares on a traditional stock exchange for the first time to raise capital from public investors. It's the same process used by companies in other industries, and it allows broader market participation in the company’s equity. In the same report, Kraken revealed that its first quarter revenue rose 19% year-on-year to $471.7 million. However, that figure still represented a 6.8% decline from the previous quarter, with trading volume dropping 9.6% to $208.7 billion and custodied assets falling 18% to $34.9 billion. (Source: Kraken Q1 financial update ) Kraken attributed the decline in activity to a broader market slowdown that was triggered by US President Donald Trump’s tariff threats, which contributed to an 18% decrease in total crypto market capitalization during the quarter. The firm also pointed out that Q4 2024 saw near-record activity levels, boosted by the volatility after Trump’s election win in November. Despite the softer market conditions, Kraken reported a 1% rise in adjusted EBITDA to $187.4 million and a 10% increase in funded accounts, reaching 3.9 million. The company also underwent a major internal restructuring under co-CEO Arjun Sethi, who was appointed in October and has since laid off around 400 employees. Tether Posts Over $1B Profit Other crypto firms also recently shared their Q1 performances. Tether, the issuer of the world’s largest stablecoin, reported over $1 billion in operating profit for the first quarter of 2025, along with nearly $120 billion in exposure to US Treasurys. Tether’s Q1 financial report The company disclosed holding $98.5 billion in direct US Treasury bills and an additional $23 billion through repurchase agreements and other cash-equivalent instruments. These holdings underpin the company’s USDT stablecoin, which now has a market cap of close to $149 billion. USDT’s all-time market cap (Source: CoinMarketCap ) Despite the strong financials, Tether’s excess reserves for USDT declined to $5.6 billion from $7.1 billion at the end of 2024. Still, the company said that it continues to leverage its surplus capital to fund strategic investments across sectors like renewable energy, artificial intelligence, peer-to-peer communications, and data infrastructure. During the first quarter, USDT’s circulating supply grew by approximately $7 billion, while the number of user wallets increased by 46 million. This signals that there is still strong demand for the stablecoin. Tether’s dominant position in the stablecoin market, alongside Circle’s USDC, gives the two issuers a combined 87% market share of dollar-pegged tokens. The US Treasury projected that the overall market cap for dollar-backed stablecoins could hit $2 trillion by 2028. However, European officials raised red flags over this growing reliance on dollar-based tokens, as they believe it poses potential systemic risks. The Bank of Italy warned that disruptions in stablecoin markets or their underlying bond holdings could reverberate across the global financial system. Saylor’s Strategy Misses Earnings Estimates Michael Saylor’s Bitcoin-focused firm Strategy, formerly known as MicroStrategy, reported a year-to-date yield of 13.7% on its Bitcoin holdings. This translates to an unofficial gain of over 61,000 BTC worth approximately $5.8 billion. In its May 1 earnings release, Strategy called these figures internal benchmarks for measuring the success of its Bitcoin investment strategy. The firm’s chief financial officer, Andrew Kang, stated that it now aims for a 25% Bitcoin yield and a total gain of $15 billion by the end of the year. Highlights from Stategy’s Q1 financial results Despite strong performance in its Bitcoin portfolio, Strategy missed Wall Street’s expectations for the first quarter. The company posted $111.1 million in revenue, which is down 3.6% from the same period last year and around 5% below analyst forecasts. It also reported a big net loss of $4.2 billion, or $16.49 per diluted share, far exceeding the projected 11 cents per share loss. The loss was largely attributed to a $5.9 billion unrealized loss on its Bitcoin holdings, which caused total operating expenses to surge by close to 2,000% to $6 billion. To fund future Bitcoin acquisitions, Strategy announced plans to offer up to $21 billion in additional stock. The firm’s aggressive Bitcoin strategy continues, with over 550,000 BTC acquired since 2020 at an average price of $68,500 per coin, totaling nearly $38 billion in costs. On May 1, the value of its Bitcoin treasury grew to more than $53 billion. Shares in Strategy (MSTR) ended May 1 up 0.39% at $381.60, though they dipped slightly in after-hours trading. The stock is up more than 31.5% year-to-date but is still way below its November 2024 high of over $470. Strategy stock price over the past 24 hours (Source: Google Finance ) Strategy is still the largest corporate holder of Bitcoin, contributing to the total of over $73 billion held by public companies. Combined with Bitcoin funds and institutional investors, more than $200 billion worth of Bitcoin is now in the hands of major financial players. Some industry observers warn that continued institutional accumulation, led by firms like Strategy, could eventually crowd out retail investors from the market.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|EXCHANGE|MARKET|USDT,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-05-02 05:53:35

Here’s why,https://timestabloid.com/analyst-calls-30-xrp-price-crash-heres-why/,"XRP has come under renewed pressure amid a broader market downturn that has affected several top cryptocurrencies. After a recent rally, Bitcoin pulled back, falling below $95,000. This slump has triggered bearish momentum across the board, and despite excitement for potential XRP ETF approval , the digital asset was not spared. Within the past few days, XRP saw its value decline significantly after hitting an intra-week high of $2.36. The asset dropped nearly 8% from that peak, and as of now, it has erased much of the prior week’s rally and is trading at $2.2, down 1.6% over the past 24 hours. Short-Term Support Level Remains Intact Despite the pullback, some analysts believe XRP still retains key technical support. In a recent update, market observer BitGuru (@bitgu_ru) noted that the token holds above a crucial consolidation range on the 1-hour chart. $XRP just faced a sharp drop from $2.3094 to $2.1543 after failing to hold above the recent consolidation range. Despite the sell-off, the price is still above the major support zone, and a bounce-back toward $2.25 or higher #XRP #TradingView pic.twitter.com/l73J2RU9Fi — BitGuru (@bitgu_ru) April 30, 2025 We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Despite the drop, the digital asset has held its position above the support level at $2.15. BitGuru suggested that continued strength above this support level could open the door for a short-term rebound. He outlined the potential for a recovery toward $2.25, with further upside possible if bullish momentum resumes. Some projections have even pointed to a scenario in which XRP revisits its all-time highs, possibly climbing to the $10-$20 range soon , though such targets remain speculative. Analyst Predicts XRP Decline Not all analysts share that optimism. In contrast, BLOCK BULL (@TheBlockBull), a well-known market analyst, recently issued a bearish forecast for XRP. He shared a technical breakdown on X, suggesting the asset will experience a 30% correction. His analysis points to a failed breakout attempt from the upper end of a bull flag pattern on the daily chart. According to BLOCK BULL, XRP’s rejection from that resistance zone has already triggered a downturn, and further weakness could bring the price as low as $1.55. He identified $1.55 as the bottom of the flag structure, positioning it as a potential target during a continued downturn. However, the projected dip could present a strategic opportunity for accumulation . The analyst indicated that large investors may use this type of price movement to enter at a discount, suggesting that although retail investors may find it difficult, long-term holders should maintain their positions.

44055125,https://nulltx.com/?p=148697,1746165294,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/nulltx.png,Spike in Whale Transfers Signals Potential Reversals for Top Cryptocurrencies,https://nulltx.com/spike-in-whale-transfers-signals-potential-reversals-for-top-cryptocurrencies/,"Beneath the surface, blockchain analytics platforms have seen a striking rise in whale activity across a number of large cryptocurrencies. This has given some pause to consider what it might mean for us common folk trading these crypto assets. Whales are powerful entities. They can make or break a market, as they say, by their sheer presence. And in the last week, the 10 cryptocurrencies with the largest percentage increases in transfers to and from entities holding over a million units were not top-tier assets by any means. Transfers carried out by whales—typically defined as on-chain transactions involving very large sums of a given asset—can often serve as early signals of market movements. In this context, an on-chain transaction is one that has been recorded on the blockchain, the digital ledger in which all transactions involving a particular cryptocurrency are kept. Accumulation of a cryptocurrency, offloading it ahead of market events, and shifting internal ecosystem assets are three large-scale activities that can and do move the prices of cryptocurrency assets. Volatility, trend reversals, and sharp rallies are three types of price movements that traders typically pay attention to. This week’s top movers include KCS, USDC (Avalanche), sENA, and WBTC (Optimism), with other notables in the bunch being UNI, USDT (Avalanche), OP, WLD (Optimism), CRV (Arbitrum), and FLOKI. This week, several cryptocurrencies have seen significant rises in whale transfers. These are the top 10, according to percentage increases among $500M+ marketcaps. 1) @kucoin $KCS 2) @circle $USDC (On Avalanche) 3) @ethena_labs $sENA 4) @wrappedbtc $WBTC (On… pic.twitter.com/qfuGvOPmYA — Santiment (@santimentfeed) April 30, 2025 Non-Stablecoin Assets Draw the Spotlight Amid Whale Surge At the head of the list is KCS, the native token of KuCoin. It experienced the highest percentage increase in whale transfers among the tracked group. The KuCoin exchange has seen a recent uptick in both user engagement and scrutiny, which could mean that its internal wallet movements or outflows to institutions are part of some recent token accumulation. These transfers don’t always mean there are buys or sells happening, but they do often come before a price move, which is something traders tend to watch. Avalanche has made the list with USDC as a synthetic dollar; the second synthetic dollar on this week’s list is sENA, a not-so-well-known synthetic dollar from Ethena Labs. Whale activity in stablecoins like USDC and USDT often reflects either capital rotation across chains or large entities preparing for trades. So, the presence of both USDC and USDT (also on Avalanche) in this week’s list could signify either a liquidity reshuffle in Avalanche or a prelude to an increase in DeFi activity on the chain. sENA’s presence is notable because of Ethena Labs’ increasing stature in the synthetic asset realm. Adoption of synthetic assets is on the rise, and large price movements in sENA—like those seen in the price of any cryptocurrency—could very well be the result of strategic hedging or some other form of institutional entry. Or, they could be a signal of something going on at the protocol level. None of that would necessarily be bad news if sENA is to fulfill its role as a synthetic stablecoin, let alone as one that can generate liquidity. And yet, sENA is increasingly a topic of conversation. Another asset drawing considerable interest is WBTC on Optimism. The on-chain dynamics of Wrapped Bitcoin tend to reflect the sentiment around using Bitcoin within cross-chain DeFi, as well as its use as collateral in the currently suboptimal DeFi landscape. When Wrapped Bitcoin and Optimism converge, it’s usually to great fanfare. Whale-sized transactions in WBTC could signal that an uptick in BTC participation across Optimism’s burgeoning native DeFi ecosystem is on the horizon. Among the tokens added to the list, the Uniswap token (UNI), the native OP token from Optimism, and the Worldcoin token (WLD)—which both operate on the layer-2 Optimism network—are some of the biggest. Whale transfers of these tokens may indicate upcoming governance decisions, asset unlocks, or speculative activity. Given the substantial network overlap these tokens have, it would appear that Optimism Capital is Concentrating this week. The CRV of Curve on Arbitrum is also very prominent. With CRV often serving as a token that incentivizes liquidity in DeFi protocols, large-scale movements could soon signal a major shift either in strategy (if the movement is toward better liquidity) or in market dynamics (if the movement is toward worse liquidity). Host to another rising whale, the meme coin turned utility project, FLOKI , rounds out the list. With movements in FLOKI seemingly also correlated to some upcoming announcements or just some good, ole hype cycles, sloshing around a still very liquid Ethereum could do any number of things in terms of price effects even if the liquid in question is not doing very much in the way of providing real economic value. For a long time, assets on comparable whale transfer lists—especially non-stablecoin assets—have shown a greater chance of short- to mid-term price reversals. But here’s the thing: this isn’t a guaranteed indicator. And the reason it isn’t shouldn’t really be surprising. After all, the price of an asset is influenced by a whole lot of (often unpredictable) factors. For traders and investors, this data represents a key opportunity to identify potential entry or exit points. While stablecoin movements typically suggest preparatory positioning, the behavior in volatile tokens like KCS, sENA, UNI, and CRV may offer more actionable signals, especially when paired with price momentum or technical indicators. These changes in whale behavior are likely to affect the broader trading story in the days ahead, and they could have an effect on volatility, which is already picking up in major markets.

As per a May 1 analysis by CryptoQuant contributor Maartun, the network currently handles approximately 8.4 million transactions every day. Although activity peaked during the 2021 and 2023 bull runs, TRON’s ( TRX ) daily usage has been increasing steadily. Maartun stressed that this level of on-chain traffic is often overlooked but remains a strong bullish signal. Milestone: TRON just crossed 10.0 B Total transactions! “Daily transaction count is around ~8.4 million. This is among the highest in the space.

According to DeFiLlama data , the network’s total value locked is currently sitting at $5.03 billion. Recent activity suggests a recovery trend, even though it is still less than the $7 billion recorded at the beginning of the year. Decentralized exchange volume, on the other hand, has reached its highest monthly level this year, rising from $3.4 billion in March to $4.9 billion in April. Additionally, TRON’s position in the stablecoin market keeps growing. The network’s stablecoin market capitalization has increased from $58 billion in Janyary to over $70 billion. In late April, there was a significant increase of $2.17 billion added in a single week. This included Tether ( USDT ) minting $1 billion USDT on Apr. 21.

44055193,https://nulltx.com/?p=148698,1746165427,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/nulltx.png,"Hyperliquid Overhauls Fee Structure and Staking Tiers, Signaling a Shift Toward Institutional Incentives",https://nulltx.com/hyperliquid-overhauls-fee-structure-and-staking-tiers-signaling-a-shift-toward-institutional-incentives/,"On May 3rd, Hyperliquid is set to make a big change in how it charges trading fees and in how it models staking. These changes, which are very likely to be observationally noticed by end users the moment they’re enacted, mark an overall shift in the way Hyperliquid looks and feels—and, in some ways, thinks. The protocol’s fee model is moving toward a tiered, incentive-based system that will, on first glance, offer more direct rewards for high-volume traders and for users with big stakes in the system. Look closer and it may seem, at least in some ways, a bit more expensive for end users who aren’t day trading or putting half their net worth into the system. The updates encompass a comprehensive revamp of both taker and maker fees, augmented trading volume thresholds for beneficial rates, and the incorporation of staking tiers associated with the platform’s native token, HYPE. Even though traders at the institutional level may forage for opportunities to clinch deeper discounts, the retail crowd and second-tier market makers will probably experience most of the injuries. The updates inflict the most damage on these two groups. New Fee Structure: Higher Costs, Higher Barriers Base trading fees will go up under the new system; these fees are for takers. They will rise from 3.5 basis points (bps) to 4.5 bps. Fee discounts will be based on two criteria: how much HYPE is staked and the user’s 14-day weighted trading volume. Despite these available reductions, most retail users will see cost increases right away. For the average trader, the increase in taker fees amounts to a 10% – 30% rise. The only users who are really benefitting from these available reductions are those staking very large amounts of HYPE—specifically, over 100,000 tokens. 1/ On May 3rd, Hyperliquid is launching staking tiers and updating its fee structure. Here's the impact traders, market makers, and Hyperliquid's revenue can expect: — Blockworks Research (@blockworksres) April 29, 2025 Changes are also afoot for makers. Most importantly, the criteria for getting a 0 bps maker fee have altered dramatically. In the past, traders with a 14-day volume of 25 million could access this premium rate. Now, the target has risen a staggering 25-fold to 500 million. This pushes mid-tier market makers out of the 0 bps tier and concentrates fee benefits at the top end of the volume spectrum. The lowest-volume makers under 5 million may see some slight improvements under the Diamond staking tier. But for everyone else, this whole scenario equates to increased costs. These changes will deal the hardest blow to the spot market. The increases in fees here are especially remarkable; some traders face hikes of up to 100%. Even the Gold-tier users—who are thought to be high-volume players—are looking at a 60% upswing in taker fees for the spot market. For makers of the spot market, the news is much worse: fees for volumes between 0 and 25 million, which used to feature 0 bps rates, now range between 1 bps and 0.6 bps (after discounts). That means fees are going up anywhere from 300% to 500% before we even consider tier-based reductions. This new model is a radical shift in Hyperliquid’s fee philosophy. The old structure allowed a very broad range of users to access low fees that were comparably equitable. The new model concentrates benefits among a quite exclusive group of users: whales and institutional traders. The cost advantages grow quite significantly with volume and token stakes, and die off just as you reach a low-volume, low-stake set of users—a.k.a. the retail traders. Staking Tiers and Protocol Revenue: Winners and Losers This new fee structure has its core in the introduction of HYPE staking tiers. Users can now lower their fees by locking up a significant amount of Hyperliquid’s native token. These tiers afford discounts of increasing magnitude. However, the most meaningful fee reductions occur at levels that are reachable only with very large amounts of HYPE—effectively pricing at small traders. This model gives clear incentives for long-term engagement and capital commitment. It seems designed to increase not just what is called “token velocity”—the rate at which a token is used in transactions—but also token demand and platform loyalty. The practical effect for most users, especially those unwilling or unable to commit large volumes of HYPE to stay engaged, will be higher trading costs, perhaps because of a disincentive to use HYPE in its native form. In terms of revenue, the changes are expected to be welcome for Hyperliquid. By expanding the base fee regime and raising the threshold for 0 bps eligibility, the protocol will pull in more fees from the vast swath of users who don’t earn the top discount rate. With even fewer traders accessing rates that are almost free and with trading activity at higher fee tiers, Hyperliquid’s protocol revenue ought to enjoy a welcome upturn. In summary, Hyperliquid’s update from May 3 now offers new incentives for whales and high-frequency institutional traders. But it puts retail participants and mid-sized market makers on a tighter-leashing and higher-cost path. The new structure indicates quite clearly who Hyperliquid wants to favor in its marketplace going forward. For most of the user base, it will now require either significantly more volume or capital to remain competitive. Disclosure: This is not trading or investment advice.

Two weeks ago, discussions around Bitcoin ( BTC ) and layer-1 protocols peaked during the market volatility brought on by the Trump administration’s sweeping tariffs. However, that’s since shifted to high market cap memecoins, Santiment marketing director Brian Quinlivan said in a May 1 blog post. “Online discussions about these high-risk tokens have proliferated as traders embrace a gamble mindset, rather than a calculated investment approach,” he said. “This is a telltale sign that traders are increasingly investing based solely on speculation and short-term gains,” Quinlivan added. Online discussions about memecoins have hit a 2025 high, surpassing discussions about Bitcoin. Source: Santiment Quinlivan said the overall crypto market rose 10% in the past eight days, but Bitcoin only gained 7%, which indicates traders are flocking to more speculative assets. “Any time Bitcoin leads an initial rally and then begins to move sideways, investors generally start taking bigger risks in hopes of scoring even higher returns through more speculative and riskier purchases,” he said. Dogecoin discussions spike on ETF news In particular, Dogecoin ( DOGE ) has seen a notable spike in positive crowd sentiment after a major decline in crowd interest during April, as various applications for DOGE exchange-traded funds were filed in the US. Despite the Securities and Exchange Commission delaying its decision on these filings until mid-June , Quinlivan says traders are in a state of cautious anticipation. “Until late April, DOGE had been on a major decline in terms of crowd interest. But its social dominance has spiked to its highest level in nearly three months, as the conversations and filings surrounding Nasdaq’s ETF listings have risen,” he said.

CoinGecko founder Bobby Ong said in a March 6 report that memecoin investor interest dropped after a series of bad launches, noting the fallout from the Libra (LIBRA) token launch in February as a significant catalyst.

Inspired by the legendary Golden Owl quest, Gowly offers an immersive journey : players must collect and analyze NFTs, solve intricate riddles and proceed step by step towards a major final reward. A Blockchain Puzzle Game Each riddle is encapsulated in a series of 9 NFTs. These tokens have visual, written or symbolic clues that must be decrypted in order to progress in the quest. In total : 6 main puzzles + a final riddle, to attempt to unlock the hidden key and win 1 Bitcoin. All transactions and game integrity are secured by the Solana blockchain. The native token, $GOWLY, is required to purchase NFTS on the dedicated marketplace w ww.enigmasolcoin.com A unique multisensory experience** Gowly goes beyond traditional visual or textual riddles by offering an immersive experience that engages multiple human senses. Some puzzles involve hearing, with auditory clues hidden within the NFTs—mysterious sounds, coded musical sequences, or encrypted voices. Each NFT can contain auditory, visual, or symbolic elements to decipher, transforming the treasure hunt into a fully immersive and engaging sensory journey. This original approach, enhanced by the owl’s graphic universe and the platform’s gamified interface, allows each player to fully immerse themselves in the quest, drawing on both intuition and analytical skills. A new form of interactive storytelling on the blockchain Gowly pushes the boundaries of traditional storytelling by blending interactive narrative, game mechanics, and Web3 technologies. Each NFT becomes a story fragment, a piece of a larger narrative puzzle where the player is both reader, investigator, and active participant. Unlike classic games, the order of solving isn’t always linear: clues can intersect, complement, or contradict one another, encouraging collaboration between players or the exchange of pieces through the marketplace. Thanks to the transparency of the Solana blockchain and a solution verification system secured by an independent notary, Gowly offers a playful, traceable, and fair adventure tailored to a new generation of connected, curious players eager for intellectual challenges. This unprecedented mix of gaming, digital art, and cryptography positions Gowly as a pioneering project in the Web3 gamified experience space. An Owl as a Guide…. and Treasure Keeper At the heart of the experience, there is the Golden Owl ‒ the projectʼs mascot and symbol ‒ which embodies the wisdom and complexity of the quest. Every player is invited to follow this owl in a step- by-step adventure, where each purchased NFT unlocks a new clue. Rewards & Gameplay 1 Bitcoin for the first player who solved all the riddles. Special NFTs and intermediate rewards (in $GOWLY and $SOL) are planned for each completed stage. A proof-of-solution system secured by an independent notary ensures the transparency of the process. From the Team -Gowldev Team ”We aim to bring back an adventure like the hunt for the Golden Owl, a quest that is both fun and mysterious, yet open to all, where the blockchain ensures the gameʼs reliability ” Useful links & Resources www.enigmasolcoin.com @GowlySolcoin t.me/gowlycoin PR Team : gowly@coinaute.com Disclaimer: This is a sponsored press release for informational purposes only.

As of the time of writing, the asset is trading at approximately $96,091, marking a 3.6% increase over the past week. This sustained climb follows a correction seen in early April and suggests that the broader market remains engaged, with momentum gradually building. As price action intensifies, analysts are increasingly focused on the indicators shaping short- to mid-term expectations. Among them is CryptoQuant contributor Axel Adler Jr., who recently shared new data indicating that Bitcoin’s on-chain momentum has entered what he calls the “start” rally zone, with a momentum ratio of approximately 0.8. This threshold is considered critical in assessing whether Bitcoin is likely to push higher or enter a period of consolidation. Related Reading: Bitcoin Sentiment Nearly Back To Neutral—Green Sign For Rally? Three Scenarios Shaping the Road Ahead In a QuickTake post titled “Bitcoin is warming up – 3 scenarios that could shape the next rally,” Adler outlined a set of possibilities based on current network data and previous cycle patterns. He describes an “optimistic” case where the momentum ratio climbs above 1.0 and holds, indicating a potential rally toward the $150,000–$175,000 range. This scenario mirrors historical breakout phases observed in 2017 and 2021, where a decisive break in key metrics sparked extended bullish runs. The “base case,” as Adler frames it, assumes that the momentum ratio stabilizes between 0.8 and 1.0, keeping Bitcoin in a broad trading range between $90,000 and $110,000. In this instance, market participants hold their positions but remain cautious about increasing exposure. A more conservative view, the “pessimistic” scenario, would be triggered if the ratio drops toward 0.75. This would suggest that short-term holders may begin taking profits, potentially leading to a correction in the $70,000–$85,000 zone. Adler emphasized, however, that with a recent correction already priced in, the optimistic and base case outcomes appear more plausible at present. Bitcoin Short-Term Holder Activity Signals Accumulation A separate analysis from CryptoQuant analyst Crypto Dan suggests further support for a bullish outlook. Dan notes that Bitcoin’s current structure bears similarities to past accumulation phases observed earlier in 2024. He highlights that in both January and October, rising activity from short-term holders—those who keep their coins for between one day and one week—preceded significant rallies. This behavioral trend has returned in recent days, which, according to Dan, often signals that the market is positioning for a larger move.

Peterson bases his prediction on three key data sets: trend analysis, seasonality, and market volatility. According to Peterson, the upward movement in the Bitcoin price is based on a trend that has been going on for 2 years. Stating that this trend is supported not only by technical analysis but also by fundamental dynamics such as “adoption economics”, the economist said, “If this trend continues, Bitcoin could rise above $ 135,000 in the coming period.” Peterson also drew attention to the seasonal fluctuations frequently observed in investment markets. He noted that Bitcoin has historically performed above average in June and July, similar to the increases in January and the holiday periods. Peterson argued that Bitcoin has performed below average since the beginning of 2025, and stated that the price could rise again thanks to the seasonal effect and the $130,000 level could be seen by August. Related News: ImportantMilestone for Surprise Altcoin: Total Transaction Count Exceeds 10 Billion Peterson, who also made evaluations on the volatility index (VIX), stated that the VIX falling below 18 indicates that “risk appetite” will revive. The economist, who explained that Bitcoin is currently highly correlated with NASDAQ and that the daily tracking error is below 5%, said, “If this correlation continues and VIX falls below 18, Bitcoin can rise to $ 107,000 in 2-3 weeks and above $ 135,000 in 100 days.” *This is not investment advice.

This week’s event is around average compared to previous weeks, while derivatives crypto trading has remained muted as spot markets show signs of recovery. Bitcoin Options Expiry This week’s batch of Bitcoin options contracts has a put/call ratio of 1, meaning that the short and long contract sellers are evenly matched. There is also a max pain point of $90,000, which is where most losses will be made on expiry. Moreover, open interest (OI), or the value or number of BTC options contracts yet to expire, is highest at the $100,000 strike price, with around $1.5 billion, indicating a bullish shift in sentiment as derivatives speculators bet on higher prices. However, there is a fair amount of OI at the $80,000 and $65,000 strike prices as the bears are keeping their short options open, according to Deribit. Options Expiry Alert At 08:00 UTC tomorrow, over $2.85B in crypto options are set to expire on Deribit. $BTC : $2.54B notional | Put/Call: 0.95 | Max Pain: $90K $ETH : $316M notional | Put/Call: 0.88 | Max Pain: $1,800 Market shows strong BTC call stacking above $95K, what… pic.twitter.com/imA4XY34Eq — Deribit (@DeribitOfficial) May 1, 2025 In a market update earlier this week, derivatives provider Greeks Live said “implied volatility is continuing to decline in the recent past, with short- and medium-term declines especially evident in BTC.” Analysts added that the market is not anticipating much volatility going forward. “Despite the BTC price oscillating at $95,000, market sentiment on the cryptocurrency side of the market is not high and can only be described as improving.” “Derivatives markets are still relatively subdued,” concurred Deribit before adding, “BTC volatility trades low and steep with short-dated smiles skewed neutral, and funding rates remain close to zero after some negative spikes.” In other words, short-term trading patterns appear neutral, and fees that traders pay to hold positions are staying close to zero. In addition to today’s tranche of Bitcoin options, there are around 175,000 Ethereum contracts that are also expiring today, with a notional value of $317 million, a max pain point of $1,800, and a put/call ratio of 0.87. This brings Friday’s combined crypto options expiry notional value to around $2.85 billion. Crypto Market Outlook Crypto markets appear to be ending the week on a high note, with total capitalization up marginally to reach $3.12 trillion after a week of trading sideways. Bitcoin was leading the pack as it has done all year, tapping $97,340 in an intraday high on Thursday. BTC had dipped just below $97,000 at the time of writing during the Friday morning Asian trading session, but was up 3% since the same time last week. Ethereum had made minor gains, reaching $1,860, its highest level for a month, but prices remain at crypto winter lows despite the 2% gain. Other altcoins doing well today include Dogecoin, Avalanche, Litecoin, and Hyperliquid .

Pseudonymous analyst Capo tells his 954,800 followers on the social media platform X that Bitcoin may decline more than 37% of its current value if it loses $92,000 as support. “After a strong bounce from April’s low at $75,000, BTC has now reached the $92,000-$98,000 target area I previously marked on the chart. To keep it simple: Above $92,000-$93,000: bullish, but strong resistance at $96,000-$98,000. Below $92,000: bearish. In my opinion, we’re seeing low timeframe distribution at these levels. Still, while it lasts, altcoins could keep pumping. I’ll start taking profits soon.” Source: Capo/X Looking at his chart, the analyst suggests Bitcoin could plummet to $60,000 if it fails to hold $92,000 as support. Bitcoin is trading for $96,608 at time of writing, up 2.6% in the last 24 hours. Next up, the analyst tells his 125,860 subscribers on his Telegram channel that he is remaining bullish on the graphics processing unit (GPU) rendering network altcoin Render ( RENDER ). “RENDER update (before and after). 60% up from entry. $4.25 level reclaimed. Looking good to reach the main target.” Source: Capo/Telegram Looking at his chart, the analyst suggests Render will next hit $6.58.

In a statement released Thursday , the company attributed the revenue jump to increased trading activity amid volatile conditions, despite noting a sequential decline of 7% from Q4 2024. Kraken Sees 17% EBITDA Growth Adjusted EBITDA also rose 17% year-over-year to $187.4 million, while overall trading volume on the platform surged by 29% over the same period. “While Q1 revenue declined 7% sequentially due to overall market softness, adjusted EBITDA rose 1% – highlighting Kraken’s resilience amid seasonality,” the company noted in a blog post. The statement added that Q4 2024 saw unusually high trading activity due to the U.S. election season, which tapered off in the following quarter. Kraken, which is preparing for a potential public listing in 2026, has continued to diversify its offerings. The company recently acquired NinjaTrader to enable derivatives trading in the U.S. and has expanded into equities and ETFs through a brokerage deal with Alpaca. In the UK, Kraken launched derivatives trading this week, marking a key move in its second-largest market. Kraken Head of Derivatives Alexia Theodorou emphasized that while spot and derivatives volumes are currently similar, derivatives hold significantly greater growth potential. The exchange also introduced Kraken Pay, a new consumer-focused financial app, alongside an institutional-grade API to enhance professional access.

Kraken also said it continues to gain market share and deepen client engagement despite macroeconomic uncertainty. Co-CEO Arjun Sethi reaffirmed Kraken’s plans to go public, even amid cooling IPO sentiment. Other exchanges like Bullish and Gemini have similarly signaled interest in entering public markets, although many remain cautious in light of unpredictable policy signals from the Trump administration. Kraken Mulls 2026 IPO Kraken is preparing for an initial public offering (IPO) as early as the first quarter of 2026, taking advantage of what appears to be a more favorable regulatory climate under President Donald Trump. Kraken’s IPO plans are not yet final and could change in the coming months. As reported, the SEC has agreed in principle to dismiss its lawsuit against cryptocurrency exchange Kraken, according to a statement from the company. The case will be dropped with prejudice, meaning it cannot be refiled. Kraken will not admit to any wrongdoing, pay penalties, or change its business operations. The SEC sued Kraken in November 2023 , alleging it operated as an unregistered securities exchange, broker, clearing agency, and dealer. The regulator also accused the company of commingling customer and corporate funds. Kraken contested the charges, leading a federal judge to rule the case had enough merit to proceed to trial.

On the other hand, newer utility projects like SUI are shining, as SUI emerges as one of the best performers for the week. However, the token that shines the most is FXGuys ($FXG), which has already been declared as one of the best Trade2Earn crypto platforms on the market. Take a look at where the XRP price prediction 2025 and the SUI price prediction 2025 are heading, and see how they compare to $FXG’s promising future. >>>JOIN FXGUYS HERE XRP Price Prediction 2025: Struggling To Hold Ground Amid Liquidations Ripple traders have had a very rough week so far. Namely, as the tariff-driven market crash started to fade, many altcoins, including XRP, rose in price. Naturally, Ripple traders expected XRP to hold its momentum, and many opened long positions to capitalize on this. However, the opposite happened, as the XRP price started falling even while most altcoins were still in the green. As a result, more than $10 million in long positions were liquidated in the span of 24 hours, which plummeted XRP’s open interest. This also showed that XRP isn’t as strong as many thought, and now experts’ XRP price prediction 2025 says that more decreases are on the way. At the moment, the XRP price is at $2.19, down over 8% in the last month. In the coming weeks, experts expect it to fall to $2 due to negative sentiment and increasing selling pressure. SUI Price Prediction 2025: Pokémon Rumours Send Price Soaring As mentioned, SUI absolutely ripped after the market crash, rising by over 60% in price in just one week. Now, the SUI price is at $3.56, and interest in SUI is climbing at massive speeds. Many say that SUI’s rally was sustained by rumours about a possible Pokémon partnership, as this could bring a huge wave of adoption for SUI if true. Even though nothing is confirmed, just the possibility of the partnership has brought in significant growth for SUI, upping its stablecoin and trading volume. With all these in mind, experts’ SUI price prediction 2025 is rather positive. They expect it to easily outperform XRP and reach $6 or more this year, marking a 68% rise from its current level. Enter FXGuys: One of the Most Lucrative Trade2Earn Crypto Platforms Available Now for the wildcard that’s set to outperform both XRP and SUI – FX Guys!

According to a May 1 announcement from the U.S. Department of the Treasury’s Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN), the agency is looking to label Huione Group as a “primary money laundering concern” and block it from accessing the American banking network FinCEN’s proposed rule would prevent U.S. financial institutions from opening or maintaining any correspondent or payable-through accounts for Huione Group. “Today’s proposed action will sever Huione Group’s access to correspondent banking, degrading these groups’ ability to launder their ill-gotten gains,” Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said in an accompanying statement. While the company doesn’t directly bank in the U.S., FinCEN claims it reportedly operates through overseas firms that do, giving it indirect access to the American financial system. Authorities say this access has allowed Huione to quietly support major cybercriminal operations, including laundering stolen crypto for North Korea’s notorious Lazarus Group. You might also like: Google delists Huione app after Elliptic report According to the financial crimes watchdog, the group allegedly helped move at least $4 billion in illicit funds between August 2021 and January 2025, with a notable portion of those funds linked to online scams, such as pig butchering . One of the biggest concerns is that Huione has built a sprawling network of businesses designed to support its operations. These include Huione Pay, a payment services firm; Huione Crypto, a virtual asset platform; and a controversial Telegram-based marketplace that recently rebranded to Haowang Guarantee. FinCEN also flagged Huione’s stablecoin, USDH , which is pegged to the U.S. dollar but designed in a way that makes it hard to freeze. Officials believe it’s being used to sidestep oversight and quietly funnel illicit funds into fiat currency. “Because Huione Group claims that USDH cannot be frozen, this service offers Huione Group’s clientele a virtually risk-free ecosystem to move or store CVC without the risk of interception or “freezing” by law enforcement,” FinCEN noted in its rulemaking submission. In July 2024, Tether froze nearly $30 million in USDT linked to Huoine accounts, which may have prompted the launch of USDH. The proposed rule is now open to public comment for 30 days before it can take effect. Back in July 2024, blockchain forensics firm Elliptic raised red flags around Huione, calling it a central hub for Southeast Asian cybercriminals. The report described the company’s marketplace as the biggest of its kind, with thousands of Telegram channels offering laundering services, scam website tools, and even human trafficking-related services. The platform’s mobile app was eventually delisted from the Google Play Store in January following criminal allegations, but it remains active on the Apple App Store.

Monitoring social commentary can be used alongside technical tools in a trading strategy, as positive chatter tends to support price rises, while negative chatter can fuel bearish trades. Online discussions around XRP are skewed toward bulls with few bearish outlooks, despite an overall drop in social discussions for XRP compared to other majors. The perceived likelihood of a spot XRP ETF approval by the end of 2025 has risen to 85%, up from 65% just two months ago, per Polymarket. Such a boost in confidence comes despite the SEC’s recent decision to delay rulings on spot DOGE and XRP ETF proposals until June 17. Technical analysis remains bullish, showing strong accumulation patterns in the current market lull. Online tone for Dogecoin has shifted dramatically following the April filings by 21Shares and Bitwise for DOGE spot ETFs. Until late April, DOGE was in a prolonged lull in social attention, but its social dominance has now surged to a three-month high, Santiment noted. The House of Doge and Dogecoin Foundation’s support for 21Shares’ application has added further credibility to the effort, helping DOGE shed some of its ""memecoin"" baggage. “After being seen mainly as a meme or joke coin, DOGE is now viewed as a more serious investment option with potential for wider adoption,” Santiment said. “Analysts and traders have noticed heavy accumulation by whales, with bullish patterns forming in the charts, which has added to the sense that Dogecoin may be entering a new growth phase,"" it added. Meanwhile, tokens like ether (ETH), Solana’s SOL and BNB show mixed social signals even as bitcoin staged a recovery above $97,000 early Friday.",Markets|Dogecoin|XRP|ETF|News,EN,0,0,DOGE|MARKET|SOL|TRADING|XRP,"{'name': 'CoinDesk', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/5/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coindesk,2025-05-02 07:21:19

Speaking on Fox Business Network on Thursday, Scott pointed out that 2-year Treasury yields have dropped below the federal funds rate, something that usually means traders expect the central bank to cut rates soon. “We are seeing that two-year rates are now below fed funds rates, so that’s a market signal that they think the Fed should be cutting,” Scott said. As of press time, the 2-year note yield was down to 3.7%, falling about five basis points that day. That’s now nearly 0.7% lower than the Fed’s current effective rate of 4.33%, according to data from CNBC. Source: CNBC Right now, the official Fed range sits between 4.25% and 4.50%, unchanged since it cut rates by a full percentage point late last year. Scott, who serves as the U.S. Treasury Secretary, said these numbers matter because he speaks with Fed Chair Jerome Powell every week. And this yield drop is going to be right at the center of their next meeting. He said the bond market is sending “a pretty direct message.” Traders expect full percentage point cut while Fed stalls The gap between the Fed’s policy rate and the 2-year Treasury yield has been growing for two months straight. That widening gap reflects how investors are betting on where monetary policy is headed. CME’s data shows that people in the fixed-income space have started betting on a full 1% cut before the end of the year. That’s double what the Fed’s own forecasts show right now. Scott claimed that his focus, and the focus of the Trump administration, is changing toward 10-year Treasury notes. Those affect consumer borrowing the most—mortgages, auto loans, and business credit. On Friday morning, the 10-year yield had dropped to 4.148%, down more than two basis points. The 2-year yield was also down more than one basis point, sitting at 3.607%. Since the Friday before Trump’s January inauguration, the 10-year yield has fallen by 0.5%. However, volatility has been extreme lately, and Scott said that’s because of the White House’s unpredictable rollout of tariffs. Source: CME While Scott looks at rates, investors are tracking what the Fed will actually do at its May 6-7 meeting. Right now, the CME FedWatch tool shows a 95% chance the Fed keeps rates steady next week. But beyond that? Markets are still expecting four rate cuts by the end of 2025. There’s a clear gap between what officials are saying and what investors are expecting. That pressure gets more intense when you bring inflation into the picture. On Wednesday, the personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price index (the Fed’s preferred inflation gauge) showed a 3.6% jump for the quarter. That’s way up from the 2.4% posted last quarter. Even core PCE, which strips out food and energy, rose 3.5%. It’s not the kind of inflation print that makes rate cuts easy to justify. Cryptopolitan Academy: Want to grow your money in 2025?

XRP’s explosive surge was fueled by a perfect storm of rising adoption, hype, and mainstream curiosity, a formula that rarely repeats. However, whispers across the crypto space suggest a new contender is stepping up, Mutuum Finance (MUTM). The token’s presale has exceeded $7.3 million while it has attracted over 9200 holders. Investors now invest at $0.025 knowing very well that the price will be at $0.03 when phase 5 starts. Current investors will see a 140% return on investment when the project is trading at $0.06 at launch. Mutuum Finance Presale Experiences Growth in Investor Demand Mutuum Finance is gaining traction as a new favorite among decentralized lending circles owing to its disruptive dual-lending model. During its presale, the project has gained 9200 investors and earned $7.3 million. With the ongoing presale, investors are witnessing an increase in Mutuum Finance token price from $0.025 to $0.03 during Phase 5. Industry experts have labeled Mutuum Finance as one of the most undervalued DeFi startups which can smash over a $5 worth after public launch. In a recent release, Mutuum Finance introduced a dynamic dashboard and a live leaderboard for the top 50 token holders. The top 50 holders of Mutuum Finance will be displayed and will also receive bonus tokens for maintaining their rank. The Mutuum Finance game-changing hybrid lending model merges Peer-to-Contract and Peer-to-Peer protocols to provide its community twin robust investing models. The P2C model enables users to invest in pools to receive passive USDT smart contract lending returns and the P2P model enables users to peer directly for lending and borrowing with no intermediary. The innovative merge of Peer-to-Contract and Peer-to-Peer lending models enables Mutuum Finance to provide investors with secure high-return services with an effective and decentralized platform. Creating a Stable and Secure DeFi Platform In order to offer long-term stability, Mutuum Finance is launching a completely collateralized, USD-backed stablecoin on the Ethereum blockchain. In contrast to earlier algorithmic stablecoins that failed, the stablecoin will be over-collateralized, with negligible risk and maximum trust. The platform also makes use of open financial architectures and audited smart contracts to address deficiencies that have hindered other DeFi projects. Rewarding Early Adopters and Growing the Community Mutuum Finance also focuses on increasing its user base through incentivizing schemes. The $100,000 giveaway will provide 10 rewards of $10,000 in MUTM tokens, and the referral program will provide rewards for referrals both individually and organizationally. Adopters of the platform will be provided VIP updates so that they will be engaged with the platform for the long term. Mutuum Finance is rapidly proving it has the potential to mirror the kind of explosive growth that Ripple (XRP) delivered in 2017. With over $7.3 million raised, more than 9,200 investors onboard, and token prices already set to climb from $0.025 to $0.03 in Phase 5, the momentum is undeniable. Early adopters stand to gain a 140% ROI when the price reaches $0.06, with projections pointing toward a possible $5 valuation at public launch. The opportunity to join a DeFi revolution led by a hybrid lending model, a USD-backed stablecoin, and exclusive rewards for early investors is now. Secure your position in the Mutuum Finance presale today and be part of the next parabolic run toward financial freedom.

The bounce has come against a backdrop of waning volatility, a drying supply of BTC on exchanges, and increasing on-chain accumulation. Miner Metrics Signal a Bottom Beyond the price action, Bitcoin maximalist Robert Breedlove sees a deeper story unfolding, one rooted in miner economics, long-term behavior, and global liquidity trends. According to him, BTC may be on the cusp of a major bull run, with key indicators flashing green. In a post on X, the podcast creator spotlighted a critical metric, the average miner cost of production, which he said has historically served as a reliable indicator of market bottoms. He noted that the average miner break-even cost has often coincided with major cycle bottoms since 2016. The premise isn’t far-fetched since assets rarely trade below their production cost in a rational market. This factor has often pushed out unprofitable miners, reducing supply and eventually pushing prices higher. Citing data from Blockware, Breedlove stated that currently, the average market break-even line is signaling another floor, potentially setting the stage for a fresh bull run. Another optimistic signal comes from Bitcoin’s long-term holders. These are investors who refuse to sell despite volatility. The analyst noted that over the past 30 days, such holders have accumulated an additional 150,000 BTC, creating the perfect condition for a supply shock and eventual price pump. On-chain data shows whales purchased roughly $4 billion worth of Bitcoin in the last two weeks of April, a trend paralleled by renewed inflows into spot BTC ETFs, which saw sustained accumulation from April 17 to April 30. Meanwhile, the amount of the flagship cryptocurrency on exchanges has fallen to a five-year low. “Bitcoin is running out of sellers in the $80K to $100K range,” Breedlove said, reinforcing the growing scarcity thesis. Liquidity Can Spur BTC Boom Further supporting his sunny outlook is a macroeconomic backdrop that’s becoming quite favorable for BTC. The market watcher drew attention to the cryptocurrency’s high correlation with the U.S. dollar and global fiat liquidity, a point often harped on by former BitMEX CEO Arthur Hayes. With central banks easing controls and rising global liquidity, the “What is Money” host expects more capital to flow into risk assets, including crypto. According to Breedlove, the rise of ETFs, institutional custody solutions, and BTC-backed financial products has only amplified this effect, making it easier for new money to flow into crypto. “Bitcoin is highly correlated to fiat liquidity – and that’s becoming increasingly more of the case as ETFs, Bitcoin Treasury Companies, and Convertible Bonds, provide easier access for new liquidity to enter the Bitcoin market.” The post Bitcoin Up 25% Since April: Expert Sees Bullish Signals in Miner Data appeared first on CryptoPotato .",BTCEUR|BTCGBP|BTCUSD|BTCUSDT|Crypto News|featured1|Bitcoin|Bitcoin (BTC) Price|Bitcoin Mining,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|FIAT|MARKET|TRADING,"{'name': 'Crypto Potato', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopotato.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopotato,2025-05-02 07:30:34

Shiba Inu turned a joke into a multi-billion-dollar movement. Pepe Coin sparked chaos with frog-fueled frenzy and overnight millionaires. But now, a growing number of holders from both camps are quietly shifting their gaze. Enter Remittix (RTX), a low-cap PayFi upstart that’s not barking or ribbiting, but building. With real-world utility baked in from day one and a $14.6 million presale already under its belt, RTX is being whispered about in crypto news sites and X threads as the next potential 1000x runner. While Shiba and Pepe built communities around culture, Remittix is doing something different: it’s fusing meme momentum with financial infrastructure. Could this be the moment where the next generational wealth play slips in under the radar? Let’s dig in. Remittix turns crypto into cash without breaking a sweat Remittix isn’t just another PayFi token; it’s fast becoming the backbone of a new financial era. At its core is a bold promise: to make crypto feel like cash, minus the middlemen. Users can instantly convert over 50 cryptocurrencies into 30+ fiat currencies, sending funds directly to any bank account worldwide. The kicker? Recipients never need to know the money began its life as crypto. With a flat fee structure and no hidden wire or FX costs, Remittix is leveling the playing field. But it’s not just for casual users. Businesses are catching on fast. The Remittix Pay API lets merchants accept crypto and settle in fiat with zero friction. From cross-border payroll to automated smart contract payouts, it’s built for scale. Now deep into its presale with 62.7% of tokens sold (nearly 531 million RTX claimed), Remittix is gathering momentum. For those watching the next big disruptor, this isn’t just a platform. It’s a movement. Shiba Inu’s rally falters as long-term holders start to rethink Shiba Inu ’s charm may have launched it to stardom, but the charts tell a sobering story. For the past three months, SHIB has been trapped in a stubborn downtrend, and recent attempts at recovery have fizzled out just as fast as they began. The Age Consumed metric has surged, signaling that long-term holders are unloading, likely in a bid to cut their losses as confidence wavers. Shiba Inu Age Consumed. Source: Santiment Even more telling is the MVRV Long/Short Difference, which shows short-term traders currently holding the profit edge. That dynamic often breeds volatility, as quick exits become more likely than conviction holds. In short, while SHIB’s community remains massive, the smart money appears cautious, and the token’s near-term trajectory looks shaky. It’s in moments like these, when sentiment cools and uncertainty rises, that some holders begin looking elsewhere. And lately, more eyes are drifting toward Remittix , where early momentum and real-world use are impossible to ignore. Pepe Coin eyes new highs as resistance levels crumble Pepe Coin’s recent performance paints a promising picture. After breaking out from a descending channel in late 2024, PEPE surged by 150 percent in a matter of days, quickly stabilizing above key resistance zones. Source: WorldOfCharts Last month, it tested the $0.0000225 price point, showing a solid 28 percent gain from its earlier low of $0.00001725. This upward movement has given investors renewed confidence, with many speculating a continuation of the bullish trend. With steady trading volume backing the price action and strong support at $0.0000220, PEPE seems poised for further gains. And as it trends upwards, investors are starting to look beyond PEPE, curious if other emerging coins like Remittix will follow suit. Final thoughts As Ethereum fuels DeFi’s latest bull run, tokens like Shiba Inu, Pepe Coin , and Remittix are riding the momentum in wildly different ways. While SHIB and PEPE lean on hype and technicals, Remittix brings real-world utility that’s hard to ignore. Its presale traction and crypto-fiat functionality hint at staying power. In a market full of moonshots, Remittix might just be the rare project built to actually land.

Bitcoin Long-Term Holder Profit Will Hit 350% At 99,900 In its latest weekly report, Glassnode has talked about the latest trend related to the Bitcoin long-term holders. The “long-term holders” (LTHs) refer to the Bitcoin investors who have been holding onto their coins since more than 155 days ago. The LTHs make up for one of the two main BTC holder cohorts divided on the basis of holding time, with the other side being known as the “short-term holders” (STHs). Related Reading: Bitcoin Sentiment Nearly Back To Neutral—Green Sign For Rally? Statistically, the longer an investor holds onto their coins, the less likely they become to sell them at any point, so the LTHs with their long holding times can be considered more resolute than the STHs. Below is the chart shared by the analytics firm that shows how the total supply held by these HODLers has changed during the last couple of years. As is visible in the graph, the Bitcoin LTH Supply has witnessed an increase over the past two months or so, a sign that some STHs have been maturing into the cohort. In total, the metric has gone up by 254,000 BTC during this period. While the LTHs tend to be resolute entities, it’s not as if they never sell at all. From the chart, it’s apparent that these diamond hands took profits during both the major rallies from last year. Recently, BTC has once again been trying to put together bullish momentum, but the continued uptrend in the LTH Supply implies these HODLers haven’t decided to sell yet. As for when this cohort would become enticed enough to sell, perhaps history can provide a hint or two. In the chart, Glassnode has attached the data for the average cost basis or Realized Price of the LTHs and some price lines that correspond to a specific degree of profit/loss for this cohort. At present, the BTC price is far above the LTH Realized Price, so the members of this group would be carrying a significant amount of profit. Despite this fact, these HODLers don’t seem to be willing to part with their coins just yet. As for when their tune might change, the report has explained: Historically speaking, the Long-Term Holder cohort typically ramps up their spending pressure when the average member is holding a +350% unrealized profit margin. Related Reading: Old Bitcoin Whales Resurface With $760M Move—Brace For Impact? Based on their current cost basis, the LTHs can be expected to reach this 350% profit threshold when Bitcoin hits the $99,900 mark. Thus, if BTC’s recovery run continues this far, it’s possible that the cryptocurrency might find some trouble due to the HODLer selling. BTC Price At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading around $96,500, up around 4% in the last seven days.

When the lines blur between man and machine, you’re looking at artificial general intelligence (AGI). Unlike its counterpart, artificial narrow intelligence (ANI), which is the use of AI for solving individual problem statements, AGI represents artificial intelligence that can understand, learn and apply knowledge in a way that is indistinguishable from human cognition. AGI is still theoretical, but the prospect of artificial intelligence being able to holistically replace human input and judgment has naturally attracted plenty of interest, with researchers, technologists and academics alike seeking to bring the concept of AGI to reality. Yet another strand of prevailing research seeks to explore the feasibility and implications of AGI vs. ANI in a world increasingly shaped by AI capabilities. Indeed, while ANI has already transformed various industries, AGI’s potential goes far beyond. Imagine a world where machines can not only assist humans in their tasks but also proactively understand the drivers behind specific tasks, predict outcomes, and autonomously create innovative solutions to achieve optimal results. This paradigm shift could revolutionize healthcare, education, transportation and countless other fields. Why is AGI so powerful? Unlike ANI, AGI is not confined to pre-programmed tasks or predefined responses within a limited domain. Instead, it has the potential to generate and apply knowledge across various contexts. Imagine a self-driving car powered by AGI. It can collect a passenger from a train station but also personalize the journey with custom recommendations for pit stops, sightseeing avenues or navigating unfamiliar roads to arrive at the desired destination. And because it’s a machine, AGI would not experience fatigue and would continue learning and improving at exponential speeds. Here’s a definition of AGI by Vitalik Buterin , who highlights the sheer potential of AGI: The example highlights some interesting features of AGI, which include: Learning capability: AGI can learn from experiences and improve its performance over time without a concerted effort by human programmers to perform additional data set training . This learning is not limited to specific tasks and instead encompasses a broad spectrum of activities. Problem-solving skills: AGI can solve complex problems by applying logical reasoning just as a human would. This includes consideration of non-traditional variables, such as emotional impact, which can highlight an even wider range of potential outcomes. Adaptability: AGI can adjust to new situations and environments without explicit programming, which means it can thrive in dynamic and unpredictable settings. Understanding and interpretation: AGI is equipped to comprehend natural language, abstract concepts and emotional nuance, allowing for sophisticated human-machine interactions. Did you know? Blockchain timestamps could serve as a legal memory for AGI systems, allowing future audits to determine exactly what an AGI knew — and when. The pursuit of AGI: Where does it stand as of April 2025? AGI is currently the science-fiction version of AI. However, while still theoretical, the sheer potential of the concept makes AGI the science fiction equivalent of artificial intelligence. While existing models, such as ChatGPT , are constantly evolving and improving with each day, the journey to bringing AGI to life involves overcoming significant technical challenges, such as: Defining the tech stack: The purely hypothetical nature of AGI makes it exceedingly difficult, if not altogether impossible, to determine the precise nature of the technological stack required for practical implementation. Neural networks: Advances in deep learning have propelled this field forward, but AGI would also require specialist neural networks that mimic the human brain’s structure to process information and introduce a layer of emotion and nuance. Natural language processing (NLP): Significant advances are required in the field of NLP to enable machines to better understand and generate human language, incorporating nuance, emotion and complexities. This includes a more complex analysis of language syntax, semantics and context, which is still evolving in traditional machine learning models that leverage NLP. Reinforcement learning: Using reward-based mechanisms to teach machines to make decisions would allow AGI to learn optimal behaviors through trial and error. Despite advancements, creating AGI that can truly think like a human remains an elusive goal. Did you know? DeepMind warns that not all AI risks come from the machines themselves — some start with humans misusing them. In its paper titled ‘An Approach to Technical AGI Safety and Security’, DeepMind identifies four key threats: misuse (bad actors using AI for harm), misalignment (AI knowingly going against its developer’s intent), mistakes (AI causes harm without realizing it), and structural risks (failures that emerge from complex interactions between people, organizations, or systems). Can AGI think like a human? The question of whether AGI can think like a human delves into the very core of human cognition. Human thinking is characterized by consciousness, emotional depth, creativity and subjectivity. While AGI can simulate certain aspects of human thought, replicating the full spectrum of human cognition is a formidable challenge. Several dimensions of human cognition are particularly difficult to emulate: Consciousness and self-awareness: One of the defining traits of human thinking is consciousness, the awareness of oneself and one’s surroundings. AGI, as sophisticated as it may become, lacks the intrinsic human ability to introspect. AGI operates on an underlying set of algorithms and complex, learned patterns, without any subjectivity or genuine emotion. Emotional intelligence: Humans experience a wide range of emotions that influence their decisions, behaviors and interactions. While AGI can be trained to recognize and respond to such emotions, the lack of genuine emotional experience means that it cannot wholly replicate these emotions. Emotional intelligence in humans involves empathy, compassion and moral considerations, elements that are challenging to encode into machines. Creativity and innovation: Creativity involves generating novel ideas and solutions, often through intuitive leaps and imaginative thinking. AGI can mimic creativity by combining existing knowledge in new ways, but it lacks the intrinsic motivation and subjective insight that drive human innovation. True creativity stems from emotional experiences, personal reflections and cultural contexts, which AGI cannot authentically replicate. Key benefits of AGI The litmus test for AGI lies in its ability to holistically replicate a human experience. When realized, the potential benefits are enormous and stretch across various industries, spawning various aspects of daily life. Despite its limitations, AGI is increasingly viewed as a force for good across a range of industries, including: Healthcare: AGI can assist in diagnosing diseases, developing personalized treatment plans and predicting customized health outcomes, leveraging a vast body of underlying training data. Education: It can provide customized learning experiences, tutoring and academic research support. AGI can adapt to individual learning styles and pace, enhancing educational outcomes. Economics: It can optimize financial models, predict market trends, and enhance productivity. It can analyze economic data to forecast market trends and guide investment decisions. Environmental Science: AGI can analyze climate data, model ecological impacts, and propose sustainable solutions. Additionally, AGI’s potential extends to areas such as transportation, communication and entertainment, offering new frontiers for innovation. Did you know? Some futurists believe AGI systems could eventually negotiate with each other autonomously using blockchain-based smart contracts — forming agreements, trading data or even co-developing solutions without human intervention. Ethical and societal considerations The rise of AGI raises significant ethical and societal questions. While powerful, AGI requires careful consideration for safe usage, which has prompted the creation of nonprofit societies, such as the AGI Society, as shown in the image below. Fundamentally, it is crucial to address concerns such as: Safety: Ensuring AGI operates within safe and controlled parameters to prevent unintended consequences. This includes robust testing and the introduction of regulatory frameworks to oversee AGI deployment. Privacy: Protecting personal data from misuse by AGI systems. As AGI can process vast amounts of data, safeguarding privacy is paramount. Bias and fairness: Preventing discriminatory practices and ensuring equitable access to AGI benefits. Developers must ensure that AGI systems are free from biases that could lead to unfair treatment. Employment: Addressing the impact of AGI on job displacement and workforce dynamics. As AGI automates tasks, there is a need to consider its impact on employment and provide support for affected workers. The integration of AGI into society requires a thoughtful approach to its governance, ensuring that it serves the common good and respects social values. Can blockchain power AGI? AGI could create computers as smart as humans, revolutionizing fields like cryptocurrency trading or market analysis. But AGI needs trust and fairness to work for everyone. Blockchain, the tech behind Bitcoin and Ethereum, offers a secure, transparent way to make this happen. Here’s how blockchain can supercharge AGI with crypto-inspired solutions: Clear training records: Blockchain works like Bitcoin’s open transaction log, recording every piece of data (e.g., crypto trading patterns) used to train AGI. This helps ensure the system is fair and free from hidden biases. Shared decision-making: Similar to Ethereum’s smart contracts , blockchain will allow developers, traders and users to vote on AGI’s rules, ensuring no single company controls it. Safe data sharing: Like crypto wallets safeguarding funds, blockchain could protect sensitive data from crypto exchanges, allowing secure sharing for AGI training without leaks. Rewards for fairness: Developers who build unbiased AGI, such as accurate trading predictors, could earn digital tokens, just like crypto mining rewards, encouraging ethical work. However, ongoing challenges such as blockchain’s slow speed, delays in crypto transactions and limited storage capacity could make it hard for AGI to process data quickly or handle large datasets. To make blockchain AGI-ready, researchers are already exploring: Offchain storage: Decentralized systems like InterPlanetary File System (IPFS) are used to store large files offchain, while the blockchain keeps only verifiable hashes, reducing congestion. Sharding and danksharding: Like Ethereum’s scalability upgrades, sharding splits data across multiple nodes, allowing AGI to process more information without slowing down the network. Also, danksharding , an advanced form of sharding being developed for Ethereum, combines rollups and data availability sampling to scale data access efficiently — ideal for real-time AGI applications. Data pruning: Advanced blockchain models like Decentralized Artificial Intelligent Blockchain-based Computing Network (DAIBCN) prune old or irrelevant data, keeping the system lean and optimized for high-demand tasks like AGI. DAIBCN also enables secure, distributed AI computing — blending blockchain trust with AI performance. The future of AGI Artificial general intelligence represents the pinnacle of AI development, promising capabilities that rival human intellect. While AGI can simulate aspects of human thinking, achieving true human-like cognition remains a distant goal. Consciousness, emotional depth and creativity are intrinsic to human experience and pose significant challenges for AGI. Nevertheless, the pursuit of AGI continues to drive innovation and reshape our understanding of intelligence. As we advance toward this frontier, it is imperative to navigate ethical considerations and societal impacts to responsibly harness AGI’s potential. Ongoing research, identifying practical opportunities and technical requirements, and initiating dialogue across society are all essential steps to address the challenges and opportunities posed by AGI. The future of AGI holds promise, but it requires a balanced approach to ensure that its eventual integration into society enhances human well-being and respects ethical standards.",Artificial general intelligence|AGI,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|ETH|MARKET|TRADING|RESEARCH,"{'name': 'CoinTelegraph', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cointelegraph.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cointelegraph,2025-05-02 07:33:00

Besides, the volume, which had dropped significantly, has begun to rise, which suggests the bulls are barging into the markets. Besides, the Bitcoin price has surged above $97,000 and continues to show massive strength as it displays signs of recovery. With this, the sentiments are flipping in favor of the bulls, which may revamp a strong ascending trend in the coming days. Presently, the Bitcoin price is just 14% away from its ATH at above $109,000, and the recent change in the market sentiments has increased the optimism around the markets. Meanwhile, the Bitcoin volume that had dropped below $20 billion has risen back above $30 billion, which could increase the volatility of the token. The star token has been attracting more than half of the trading volume, as the BTC dominance remains on the rise. Now that the dominance has reached a 4-year high, a strong bull run is expected to begin anytime from now. The BTC dominance chart seems to be on track to mark the previous highs above 70%. Interestingly, these levels were during the 2018 and 2021 bull runs, which suggests the BTC price is in the middle of the 2025 bull run. Therefore, the BTC price is believed to maintain a healthy ascending trend throughout May 2025 and probably rise back above $100K. Bitcoin (BTC) Price Prediction for May 2025 In the short term, the Bitcoin price is poised to face some bearish action, which could drag the levels below $96,000. However, this could be a short-term pullback as the price remains highly bullish in the long term, with the potential to reach $110K before the end of the month. The weekly price action of Bitcoin suggests the token is in the middle of a strong bull run as the sentiments flipped in favour soon after the rebound from the support. Meanwhile, the CMF drops below 0, hinting towards a rise in the bearish strength within the markets. On the other hand, the weekly Bull Market Support Band (BMSB) is about to undergo a bullish crossover, which could validate the start of a bullish trend. Therefore, the Bitcoin (BTC) price appears to be primed to rise above the psychological barrier at $100K in the next few days and reach $105K by the end of the month.",Price Analysis|Bitcoin,EN,0,0,BTC|MARKET|TRADING,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-05-02 07:37:55

The TRON network has just hit a colossal milestone, officially surpassing 10 billion total transactions. This isn’t just a number; it’s a powerful indicator of the network’s widespread adoption and consistent activity. If you’re keeping an eye on TRON cryptocurrency or the broader blockchain space, this development is definitely worth diving into. Decoding the TRON Transaction Milestone According to insights shared by CryptoQuant on X (formerly Twitter), the TRON network has logged over 10,000,000,000 transactions since its inception. To put that into perspective, that’s a staggering amount of activity flowing through the network, representing countless transfers, smart contract interactions, and dApp usages. What’s even more impressive is the sustained daily activity. The network currently averages around 8.4 million transactions per day. While daily numbers can fluctuate based on market conditions and network usage, this consistent high volume underscores TRON’s position as one of the busiest blockchains globally. The blockchain transaction volume on TRON hasn’t just appeared overnight. The data from CryptoQuant highlights a steady upward trend in transaction volume, with notable surges corresponding to periods of heightened market excitement, particularly during the bull runs of 2021 and 2023. This suggests a strong correlation between overall crypto market sentiment and activity on the TRON network. What Fuels the Surge in TRON Network Activity? Hitting 10 billion transactions isn’t accidental. Several key factors contribute to the high TRON transactions volume. Understanding these drivers gives us better insight into the network’s utility and growth: USDT Dominance: A significant portion of TRON’s transaction volume comes from the stablecoin Tether (USDT). TRON has become one of the most popular networks for transferring USDT due to its speed and low fees. Many users and businesses prefer using TRC-20 USDT for remittances, trading, and payments. Low Transaction Fees: Compared to networks like Ethereum, TRON offers significantly lower transaction costs. This makes it attractive for frequent transactions, especially for smaller amounts, driving higher volume. Focus on dApps and Ecosystem: TRON has actively fostered a decentralized application (dApp) ecosystem, including DeFi protocols, gaming, and social media platforms. While perhaps not as large as some competitors, activity within these dApps contributes to the overall transaction count. Market Speculation and Trading: As highlighted by the surges in 2021 and 2023, increased trading activity on exchanges that support TRON tokens, as well as general market hype, naturally leads to more transactions as users move funds or participate in trading strategies. Network Efficiency: TRON’s delegated Proof-of-Stake (DPoS) consensus mechanism allows for faster transaction processing times compared to Proof-of-Work (PoW) chains, enabling it to handle high volumes efficiently. The interplay of these factors creates a powerful engine for generating blockchain transaction volume on TRON. Comparing TRON’s Transaction Volume How does TRON’s 10 billion milestone stack up against other major blockchains? While direct comparisons based solely on total transactions can be nuanced (different chains have different transaction types and structures), looking at cumulative volume and daily activity provides context. Ethereum, being the oldest smart contract platform, also boasts a massive cumulative transaction count. However, Ethereum’s higher gas fees mean its daily transaction count is often lower than TRON’s, especially for simple transfers. Binance Smart Chain (BSC), now BNB Chain, also sees high daily transaction volumes, often competing closely with or surpassing TRON on certain days, largely driven by DeFi and gaming activity. What the CryptoQuant data on TRON’s 10 billion milestone clearly shows is that TRON is firmly established as one of the most actively used blockchains in the world, particularly for value transfer via stablecoins. The Significance of 10 Billion TRON Transactions Reaching this milestone isn’t just a vanity metric. It signifies several important aspects about the TRON network : Robust Adoption: 10 billion transactions indicate significant real-world use and adoption, whether for transfers, dApps, or other purposes. Network Stability and Scalability: Handling such massive volume over time demonstrates the network’s ability to scale and remain operational under heavy load. Ecosystem Utility: High transaction count suggests that the applications and services built on TRON are seeing usage. Investor Confidence: A highly active network can be seen as a positive sign by investors, suggesting underlying demand and utility for the TRON cryptocurrency (TRX). While transaction count alone doesn’t tell the whole story (the nature and value of transactions also matter), reaching 10 billion is undeniably a major achievement that highlights TRON’s position in the blockchain landscape. Are There Challenges or Considerations? It’s important to look at the full picture. While high TRON transactions are positive, some considerations exist: Transaction Nature: As mentioned, a large portion is stablecoin transfers. While valid use cases, it’s different from a network driven primarily by complex DeFi interactions or NFTs. Centralization Concerns: TRON’s DPoS model, while fast, involves a relatively small number of ‘Super Representatives’ validating transactions, leading to concerns about centralization compared to networks with wider validator distribution. Spam Transactions: Like any network with low fees, there’s always the potential for a percentage of transactions to be low-value or even spam, though mechanisms exist to mitigate this. Understanding these points provides a more balanced view of the 10 billion transaction milestone. Actionable Insights and Future Outlook For users and investors interested in the TRON network and TRON cryptocurrency , this milestone offers several insights: Confirmation of Utility: The high transaction volume confirms that TRON has found significant product-market fit, particularly in the stablecoin transfer space. Indicator of Network Health: Sustained high activity is generally a positive indicator of a network’s health and relevance. Watch Stablecoin Trends: Given the reliance on USDT, monitoring stablecoin regulations and usage trends is crucial for understanding future TRON transaction volume. Evaluate Ecosystem Growth: Look beyond just transaction numbers to assess the growth and adoption of specific dApps and DeFi protocols on TRON. The future of blockchain transaction volume on TRON will likely depend on its ability to maintain its competitive edge in fees and speed, continued growth of its ecosystem, and the broader regulatory environment for stablecoins. Compelling Summary TRON’s achievement of 10 billion total transactions is a monumental feat, solidifying its position as a major player in the blockchain space. Driven by factors like efficient USDT transfers, low fees, and growing ecosystem activity, the network demonstrates robust adoption and operational capability, as highlighted by the CryptoQuant data. While challenges and considerations exist, this milestone underscores the significant utility and widespread use of the TRON network and its associated TRON cryptocurrency. It’s a testament to the network’s infrastructure handling massive blockchain transaction volume consistently, pointing towards its continued relevance in the fast-evolving world of decentralized technology.

According to him, if Bitcoin manages to reclaim its broken parabolic trendline, it could surge to a cycle peak between $125,000 and $150,000 by August or September 2025. But Brandt also warns that, after that, Bitcoin could face a sharp correction of over 50%. Let’s dive in detail! Parabolic Recovery Could Lead To $125k – $150K Rally Yes, you read that right, Bitcoin might be on its way to a six-figure price tag. The chart shared by Peter Brandt highlights a red curved line, which represents a long-term parabolic trend that has supported Bitcoin’s biggest bull runs in the past. Hey @scottmelker If Bitcoin can regain the broken parabolic slope then $BTC is on target to reach the bull market cycle top in the $125k to $150K level by Aug/Sep 2025, then a 50%+ correction pic.twitter.com/WUUzxl0ckn — Peter Brandt (@PeterLBrandt) May 1, 2025 However, Bitcoin has recently fallen below this curve, raising doubts about whether it can recover its strong upward momentum. As of now, Bitcoin is hovering around $96,797 , with its 18-week moving average (WMA) near $89,027, and the simple moving average (SMA) around $86,052. If Bitcoin can bounce back above the broken parabolic curve, Brandt sees a clear path toward his $125K–$150K price target, by August & september 2020. Further, the chart also includes a red dot around the $130,000 level, marking the possible cycle top if the parabolic strength returns. From $96K to $150K… Then a 50% Drop? Brandt warns that after reaching the projected high, Bitcoin could face a 50% or greater correction, which is consistent with past cycle behavior. A 50% drop from $125K–$150K would bring BTC back to around $62K–$75K. So while the upside is exciting, the volatility risk is just as real. This type of correction has happened before, and Brandt expects history to repeat. What About a $1 Million Price Target? Following Brandt’s tweet , one user raised a key question: Can Bitcoin ever hit $1 million if it stays within this long-term upper curve? Brandt gave a straightforward reply: “The only scenario that could change would be sudden destruction of USD, which could cause hyper thrust through upper curve — ala interest rates in Germany in the 1920s.” In simple terms, Brandt believes that for Bitcoin to break beyond this long-term channel and aim for $1 million, it would take an extreme event, like a collapse of the U.S. dollar or major global financial disruption. Otherwise, the chart suggests that such levels may remain out of reach within the current trend.",News,EN,0,0,BTC|MARKET|TRADING,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-05-02 07:45:49

BOOP has gone up more than 200%. On May 2, the on-chain analysis platform Bubblemaps showed traders the token distribution for Boop crypto amidst growing buzz surrounding the launchpad’s reward mechanism. According to the official tokenomics, 50% of the tokens will be allocated to a rewards pool for creators and holders. One of the platform’s unique features is its rewards program that grants Boop tokens to “graduate cults,” which are tokens created on the platform that meet certain milestone criteria. However, traders have grown skeptical of whether the platform will deliver on this promise. Determined to verify the information, Bubblemaps’ visualization reveals the project’s token distribution matches its tokenomics claim, with that the biggest allocation of Boop tokens going into the rewards pool. Meanwhile, 15% of its token supply has been set aside for airdrops and 10% goes to the project team.

Launched on May 1, $BOOP is the token of new Solana ( SOL ) -based meme coin launch platform Boop.fun. It bears the icon of an animated blue cat winking. The meme coin launchpad was reportedly founded by NFT whale and crypto influencer Dingaling. What sets the platform apart from other meme coin launchpads like Pump.fun and PancakeSwap is that boop.fun distributes transaction fees to BOOP token holders through its rewards program. So far, the platform claims it has allocated at least 150 million Boop crypto to be distributed to active users and influencers through a series of airdrops. In a partnership with KaitoAI, the platform identifies top X “influencers” based on followers, engagement, and meme-related activity, sorting them into tiers. Users must create a boop “cult” after creating an account via X to claim airdrops. Airdropped tokens are locked for 30 days, with faster unlocking depending on the token’s performance. However, this mechanism has sparked trader speculation, due to concerns about potential exploitation if not properly managed.

While coinbase coinbase - support@coinbase.com Wallet Centralised Exchange has not explicitly accused Movement Labs of misconduct, the timing follows a contentious $38 million token dump involving a now-terminated market maker. Why Coinbase is Delisting $MOVE Token? The MOVE token initially gained traction with significant funding, major exchange listings, and considerable hype. However, the project’s reputation was severely dented when internal documents suggested mismanagement within Movement Labs. Allegedly, Rentech, a firm tied to both Movement Labs and the disputed market maker, had undue influence over the token’s market behavior. A leaked chat and subsequent market manipulation exposed these flaws. The $38 million USDT sell-off triggered a sharp decline in MOVE’s price, drawing the attention of the Movement Network Foundation, which has since initiated an independent investigation. To mitigate the fallout, a reserve fund was established to repurchase the dumped tokens. Move Token Delisting In response to these revelations, Coinbase acted swiftly, moving MOVE into limit-only mode before formally announcing its delisting. This decision has fueled skepticism surrounding the project’s governance practices, raising questions about the transparency of its token economy and the accountability of its executives. Binance also reacted by banning Web3Port , and although Movement Labs pledged to repurchase the dumped tokens, it has yet to fulfill this commitment. The promised airdrop has also been delayed, adding to the growing discontent among the community. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : MOVE Token Scandal News: Who & How Market Manipulation Led to Massive Price Drop , MOVE Price Impact The price of MOVE suffered an immediate hit, falling more than 20% to $0.18 after the announcement. Although the price stabilized slightly at $0.20, the market cap of MOVE dropped below $500 million for the first time, reflecting investor concerns. At its peak, MOVE had reached $0.70, but it is now down by a staggering 73% from its all-time high. Despite Bitcoin’s rally to a 70-day high , MOVE’s sharp decline emphasizes how project-specific issues can outweigh broader market trends. The steepest one-day drop since the token’s launch in December signals deepening mistrust in its future. Community Response The reaction within the Movement’s Telegram channel has been one of disbelief. While some users expressed gratitude for avoiding the token, others criticized it as another scam. A community manager clarified that the action was a “suspension” and not a permanent delisting, assuring users that talks with Coinbase were ongoing. However, trust in the project’s governance remains shaky, with many unsure about MOVE’s long-term viability. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

After months of bearish pressure, ETH is attempting to reclaim key resistance levels that could determine its trajectory for the rest of Q2 2025. While the market remains cautious, several technical indicators are beginning to show signs of strength. Weekly Chart: Ethereum Testing Major Fibonacci Support Ethereum price prediction (Source: TradingView.) On the weekly timeframe, Ethereum is recovering from the 0.786 Fibonacci retracement level around $2,075, derived from the $1,097 low to the $4,105 cycle high. This region has historically served as a rebound zone for ETH. Current zone : ETH sits just below the 0.786 Fib at $2,075. Bullish recovery : If Ethereum closes a weekly candle above $2,100, a shift toward the 0.618 Fib at $2,508 becomes plausible. Risk level : A breakdown below $1,700 would suggest continued weakness, potentially targeting $1,457.

According to CoinGecko data, the liquid staking protocol Haedal (HAEDAL) rallied to an intraday high of $0.174 during Asia morning hours on May 2, marking over 100% gains from its post-launch lows. Its market cap touched $32 million, and daily trading volume climbed 20% from the previous day, hitting around $180 million. The key catalyst behind today’s move was Bithumb, a major South Korea-based crypto exchange, which announced the addition of a KRW trading pair for the HAEDAL token set at 6:00 PM KST on Friday, May 2, 2025. This makes Bithumb the latest exchange to pick up HAEDAL, following earlier listings on Binance Alpha , Bybit, KuCoin, and MEXC on April 29, shortly after Haedal’s token generation event and mainnet launch on the same day. At launch, the total HAEDAL token supply was set at 1 billion. Activity in HAEDAL’s derivatives market spiked after the news broke. Data from CoinGlass shows open interest in HAEDAL futures soared 210% in just 24 hours, crossing $45 million. The funding rate remained steady at 0.0050%, signaling that most traders are holding bullish positions and betting the rally will continue. At launch, Haedal protocol distributed 5% of its total supply, or 50 million HAEDAL tokens, through an airdrop aimed at users active in its products and Sui ecosystem partnerships. However, just hours later, the token price dropped nearly 50% as many community members rushed to cash out their airdropped tokens.

He posted the threat on Truth Social, writing: “Any Country or person who buys ANY AMOUNT of OIL or PETROCHEMICALS from Iran will be subject to, immediately, Secondary Sanctions. They will not be allowed to do business with the United States of America in any way, shape, or form.” This message followed Trump’s February decision to launch what he called a “maximum pressure” campaign aimed at completely halting Iran’s oil exports. At the White House on Thursday, he claimed Iran continues to fund militant groups across the Middle East using oil revenues. According to data from CNBC, the oil market responded right away as US crude futures went up by $1.03, or 1.77%, closing at $59.24 per barrel. Brent, the global oil benchmark, climbed $1.07, or 1.75%, ending at $62.13. Iran remains a top oil producer within OPEC, so any talk of sanctions instantly affects pricing. Trump takes aim at China and starts talks with Iran The White House didn’t directly name China, but Scott Modell, who runs Rapidan Energy and is a former CIA officer, said the message clearly pointed to Beijing. China is reportedly importing over 1 million barrels a day from Iran. Modell told CNBC that unless the administration specifically hits China’s state-owned companies and the infrastructure that supports those oil flows, those barrels will keep moving. “Trump’s comments don’t signify a change in the administration’s drive to reach a new deal with Iran but rather underscore Trump’s belief in negotiating through strength,” Modell said . Even with all the pressure, Trump isn’t closing the door on talks. In April, he opened negotiations with Iranian officials in Oman. The focus was Iran’s nuclear program. Back in February, he said the goal was to stop Iran from getting a nuclear weapon, though Tehran denies it wants one. He added that he would rather negotiate a new agreement than keep escalating tensions. This approach isn’t new. During his first term, Trump pulled the US out of the 2015 nuclear deal brokered by Barack Obama. Since then, his administration has worked to squeeze Iran’s economy, especially its oil exports, as hard as possible. One more move came earlier in April, when Trump slapped “secondary tariffs” on countries buying oil from Venezuela, another member of OPEC. Just like with Iran, the goal is to block revenue from flowing to governments he wants to isolate. Cryptopolitan Academy: Want to grow your money in 2025?

44058538,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=154493,1746172248,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Crucial Clash: Nvidia Takes Aim at Anthropic Over AI Chip Export Controls,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/nvidia-ai-chip-dispute/,"In the fast-paced world where technology policy significantly impacts global markets, including sectors relevant to cryptocurrency and digital innovation, a notable dispute has emerged. Tech giant Nvidia is publicly challenging fellow AI leader Anthropic over its support for new US government restrictions on exporting advanced AI chips . This disagreement highlights the complex landscape of international trade policy and its direct consequences for leading technology firms. Why Are AI Chips at the Center of This Dispute? Advanced AI chips , particularly those used for training large language models and complex AI systems, are considered critical technology. The US government, through the Department of Commerce, is implementing what it calls the “Framework for Artificial Intelligence Diffusion.” This framework, set to impose sweeping restrictions starting May 15th, aims to control the diffusion of advanced AI technology to certain countries, notably China. Here’s a quick breakdown of the core positions: Anthropic’s Stance: Anthropic has voiced support for these export controls. They argue that strict controls are necessary to prevent sensitive AI technology from falling into potentially adversarial hands. Interestingly, Anthropic representatives reportedly used vivid, albeit unusual, examples like chips being smuggled in “baby bumps” or “alongside live lobsters” to emphasize the perceived need for stringent measures. Nvidia’s Stance: Nvidia, a primary producer of these high-end AI chips, strongly disagrees with Anthropic’s position and the upcoming controls. A spokesperson for Nvidia told CNBC, “American firms should focus on innovation and rise to the challenge, rather than tell tall tales that large, heavy, and sensitive electronics are somehow smuggled in ‘baby bumps’ or ‘alongside live lobsters.’” Nvidia believes the focus should be on out-innovating competitors rather than relying on restrictive policies. The Impact of Export Controls on Companies Like Nvidia For a company with a significant global footprint like Nvidia , export restrictions have a direct and substantial financial impact. The company has openly stated that a new licensing requirement specifically for its H20 AI chips intended for sale in China could cost them an estimated $5.5 billion in the first quarter of their 2026 fiscal year alone. This figure underscores the importance of the Chinese market for Nvidia’s revenue streams and highlights the financial stakes involved in these policy decisions. The debate isn’t just about revenue; it’s also about market dynamics and the future of the US China tech rivalry. While the US government aims to slow down China’s AI progress, companies like Nvidia worry that being shut out of a major market could hinder their own ability to invest in R&D and maintain their technological edge in the long run. It’s a delicate balance between national security interests and commercial viability. What Does Anthropic ‘s Support Signify? Anthropic ‘s public support for stricter export controls suggests a belief that the potential risks associated with uncontrolled AI diffusion outweigh the economic considerations. As a company focused on AI safety and alignment, their position aligns with a perspective that prioritizes responsible development and control over widespread access, especially to potential strategic competitors. This divergence in opinion between two major players in the AI space — one a hardware powerhouse (Nvidia) and the other a leading AI model developer (Anthropic) — illustrates the broader tension within the tech industry regarding the balance between open innovation, global markets, and national security concerns in the age of advanced AI. Concluding Thoughts on the Nvidia vs. Anthropic Debate The public disagreement between Nvidia and Anthropic over export controls on AI chips is more than just corporate squabbling; it’s a window into the high-stakes policy debates shaping the future of technology and international relations, particularly the dynamic US China tech landscape. As the May 15th deadline for the new restrictions approaches, the industry will be closely watching how these policies are implemented and what their long-term effects will be on innovation, market access, and the global race for AI dominance. This conflict underscores that even within the cutting-edge field of AI, fundamental disagreements exist on the best path forward.

The transfer, flagged by blockchain monitoring service Whale Alert on May 2, initially sparked speculation of a large-scale dump. On-chain data, however, indicates that it was not a transfer to external wallets but rather a part of Ripple’s routine monthly escrow unlocks.

XRP price analysis. Credit: crypto.news But momentum is still lacking. The average directional index, which gauges trend strength, is low at just 12.7, and the relative strength index is neutral at 53. Lack of conviction among traders is indicated by oscillators such as the moving average convergence divergence and Stochastic, which are either neutral or slightly bullish. XRP may see a push toward the $2.50 region if bulls can break above the $2.30 resistance level. However, a decline toward $2.05 or even $2.00 is more likely if the price falls below $2.16 and is unable to hold the 50-day EMA. The flat volume indicates that traders are holding off on making a move until they receive a clearer signal. Beyond the chart, XRP is facing some big-picture questions. The Securities and Exchange Commission recently delayed a decision on the spot XRP ETF proposed by Franklin Templeton, pushing the deadline to mid-June. This action has added some uncertainty to the token’s short to mid-term outlook. Meanwhile, Ripple continues to push for growth. After launching its RLUSD stablecoin last year, the company reportedly made a $5 billion bid to acquire Circle, the issuer of USD Coin ( USDC ).

Have you ever wondered what backs the world’s largest stablecoin, Tether (USDT)? Well, the company recently pulled back the curtain a bit, revealing a staggering figure: their Tether Bitcoin holdings now stand at a whopping $7.6 billion! This isn’t just a number; it’s a significant insight into the financial muscle behind USDT and its potential influence on the broader Stablecoin market and Crypto assets landscape. Understanding Tether’s Massive Bitcoin Holdings Tether Operations Limited, the issuer of USDT, recently shared details about its reserves, and the headline figure is certainly eye-catching. They reported holding approximately $7.6 billion worth of Bitcoin as part of their extensive reserve portfolio. This positions Tether as one of the largest known corporate holders of Bitcoin globally, a fact that has significant implications for both the company and the Bitcoin news cycle. But what exactly does this mean? For a stablecoin issuer like Tether, holding reserves is fundamental to maintaining the peg of its token (USDT) to the US dollar. These reserves are essentially assets that the company holds to match the value of the USDT tokens in circulation. When you see a figure like $7.6 billion in Bitcoin within those reserves, it highlights a strategic decision by Tether to include volatile, albeit potentially high-performing, Crypto assets alongside more traditional holdings like cash, cash equivalents, and other investments. This substantial allocation to Bitcoin underscores Tether’s confidence in the cryptocurrency as a store of value and potentially a growth asset within its diverse reserve structure. It’s a move that reflects the growing institutional acceptance of Bitcoin, even from entities whose primary function is to provide stability. A Closer Look at Tether’s Balance Sheet The report didn’t just stop at the Bitcoin figure. It provided a broader snapshot of Tether’s financial health. The report stated that Tether’s total assets have a considerable value of $149.2 billion. On the other side of the ledger, its liabilities, which primarily represent the amount of USDT tokens currently in circulation, weighed in at $143.6 billion. This balance sheet structure is crucial for a stablecoin. The difference between total assets and total liabilities represents Tether’s equity or surplus. In this case, a surplus of approximately $5.6 billion ($149.2B – $143.6B) indicates that Tether holds more assets than are needed to cover its liabilities (the outstanding USDT). This surplus acts as a buffer, providing an extra layer of security and stability for USDT holders. While the report highlighted the Tether Bitcoin holdings , Tether’s reserves are typically diversified across various asset classes. A simplified view of a stablecoin reserve portfolio often includes: Cash and cash equivalents (like U.S. Treasury bills) Corporate bonds Secured loans Other investments, including cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and gold The specific breakdown of the *entire* $149.2 billion in assets is complex and subject to regular attestation reports, but the explicit mention of $7.6 billion in Bitcoin gives us a clear view of one significant component of their Crypto assets . Why Does Tether Hold So Much Bitcoin? It might seem counterintuitive for a stablecoin, designed for stability, to hold a volatile asset like Bitcoin. However, there are several strategic reasons why Tether likely includes significant Tether Bitcoin holdings in its reserves: Diversification: While cash and short-term debt are primary components, diversifying into other asset classes can help manage risk and potentially enhance overall portfolio returns. Bitcoin offers diversification away from traditional financial instruments. Potential for Appreciation: Bitcoin has historically shown significant growth potential. Including it in reserves allows Tether to potentially increase its asset base beyond just the value of outstanding USDT, contributing to the equity buffer. Industry Alignment: As a major player in the crypto ecosystem, holding Bitcoin aligns Tether with the core asset of the industry. It demonstrates confidence in the future of digital currencies beyond stablecoins. Store of Value: Many proponents view Bitcoin as a digital store of value, similar to gold. Holding it can be seen as a way to preserve wealth over the long term. This strategy isn’t without its critics, primarily due to Bitcoin’s price volatility. A significant downturn in the Bitcoin market could theoretically impact the value of Tether’s reserves. However, the substantial equity buffer ($5.6 billion) and the diversification across other, less volatile assets are intended to mitigate this risk. How Do Tether’s Holdings Impact the Stablecoin Market and Beyond? Tether’s position as the dominant force in the Stablecoin market means its actions and financial health have ripple effects across the entire crypto ecosystem. Here’s how their large Tether Bitcoin holdings and overall balance sheet can influence things: Market Confidence: A healthy balance sheet with assets exceeding liabilities (a positive equity buffer) instills confidence in USDT holders. This is crucial for maintaining the stablecoin’s peg and preventing bank-run scenarios. Bitcoin Price Influence: While Tether doesn’t constantly buy or sell large amounts, being a known significant holder adds to the overall demand side for Bitcoin. Any future large-scale buying or selling by Tether could potentially impact Bitcoin’s price, making it a key factor in Bitcoin news . Benchmarking for Other Stablecoins: Tether’s reserve composition and transparency (or lack thereof, depending on the report type) often set a de facto standard or point of comparison for other stablecoin issuers. This influences practices across the Stablecoin market . Regulatory Scrutiny: The size and composition of Tether’s reserves, particularly the inclusion of volatile Crypto assets like Bitcoin, are often subjects of regulatory interest and discussion globally. Increased scrutiny can impact Tether’s operations and the broader market. It’s clear that Tether isn’t just a stablecoin issuer; its massive asset base, including its substantial Bitcoin stash, makes it a major financial entity within the digital asset space, with connections influencing both the stablecoin and the volatile cryptocurrency markets. Navigating the Transparency Debate: Why Does it Matter? For years, Tether has faced questions and scrutiny regarding the exact composition and verification of its reserves. While they regularly publish attestations (reports verifying their assets and liabilities at a specific point in time), these are not full audits and have sometimes lacked granular detail. The recent report explicitly mentioning the $7.6 billion in Tether Bitcoin holdings is a step towards greater transparency, providing concrete numbers for specific asset classes. However, the ongoing debate about the full breakdown of the remaining ~$140 billion in assets and the independent verification process remains a key point of discussion in Bitcoin news and the broader crypto community. Why is transparency so important for a stablecoin? Importance of Transparency Impact on Users & Market Builds Trust & Confidence Users are more confident that their USDT can be redeemed 1:1 for USD. Ensures Stability Verifiable reserves confirm the stablecoin is fully backed, reducing systemic risk in the Stablecoin market . Informs Regulatory Bodies Clear reporting helps regulators understand the risks and structure of major Crypto assets and stablecoins. Provides Market Clarity Knowing reserve composition helps analysts and investors understand potential market impacts (e.g., if reserves include volatile assets). Increased transparency benefits everyone in the ecosystem by providing a clearer picture of the financial health and backing of the most widely used stablecoin. Actionable Insights for Crypto Users What does this information about Tether Bitcoin holdings and their balance sheet mean for you, the everyday crypto user or investor? USDT Stability: The reported surplus of assets over liabilities ($5.6 billion) is a positive sign for the stability of USDT. It suggests a healthy buffer against potential market shocks, including volatility in their Tether Bitcoin holdings . Market Context: Understand that Tether is a significant player. Their reserve strategy, including their large Bitcoin allocation, is a factor in the broader market dynamics. Keep an eye on major announcements from Tether as part of your Bitcoin news consumption. Diversification is Key: Just as Tether diversifies its reserves, individual investors should consider diversifying their own crypto portfolios rather than putting all their funds into a single asset or stablecoin. Stay Informed: Continue to follow reports and analyses on stablecoin reserves and regulatory developments. This knowledge is crucial for navigating the Stablecoin market safely. While Tether’s large Bitcoin holding is notable, it’s just one piece of a much larger and more complex financial structure. Understanding the full picture, including the total assets, liabilities, and the ongoing efforts (or challenges) in transparency, is key. Conclusion: Tether’s Bitcoin Stash – A Sign of Confidence and Influence Tether’s revelation of holding $7.6 billion worth of Bitcoin is more than just an interesting statistic; it’s a powerful statement about the increasing integration of traditional financial concepts (like reserves and balance sheets) with the volatile world of cryptocurrencies. As the issuer of the dominant stablecoin, USDT, Tether’s financial health and reserve composition are critically important for the stability of the entire Stablecoin market and influence perceptions of Crypto assets globally. The reported $149.2 billion in assets against $143.6 billion in liabilities paints a picture of a well-collateralized stablecoin, backed by a significant equity buffer. The inclusion of a substantial amount of Tether Bitcoin holdings reflects a strategic choice to diversify and potentially benefit from the upside of the leading cryptocurrency, while also introducing the inherent volatility risk that must be managed. As the crypto market matures, transparency surrounding major entities like Tether will remain paramount. While steps have been taken, continued clarity on the full reserve breakdown will further build trust and solidify the foundation of the digital asset ecosystem. For now, Tether’s massive Bitcoin stash stands as a testament to Bitcoin’s growing role and Tether’s significant influence within the crypto world.

44058965,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=719507,1746172861,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/44058965.jpeg,Dollar and stocks head for 3rd straight weekly win as US-China trade deal hopes rise,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/dollar-and-stocks-head-for-3rd-weekly-win/,"The dollar and U.S. stock market are grinding toward their third straight weekly win, thanks to rising talk that the U.S. and China might actually return to the table for trade talks. Early Friday, Asian markets caught fire. The Australian dollar rose hard, up 0.5% to $0.6412. New Zealand’s kiwi moved too, gaining 0.4% to $0.5932. Both are risk currencies that bounce with China news, and both jumped after the offshore yuan surged to 7.2519 against the dollar, its strongest level since April 4. Traders are reacting to fresh signs that the two global powers may resume negotiations. A late Thursday broadcast from Chinese state media was read as a green light from Beijing. Then Marco Rubio, the U.S. Secretary of State, told Fox News, “Talks with China will come up soon.” These hints landed after weeks of volatility triggered by President Donald Trump’s tariffs, which gutted market confidence and sent asset prices flying in all directions. Yuan climbs, yen tanks, dollar keeps going Alvin Tan, a currency analyst in Singapore, reportedly said: “The dollar was hit so badly in the immediate aftermath of the tariffs, so now in the broad picture there’s a normalisation in the market. The market is keeping one eye on the economic situation, but the other eye is looking for positive developments in China.” That’s where the optimism is coming from, less about what’s happening, more about what could. The greenback still looks solid for the week. It fell 0.2% on Friday, but is still headed for a 0.3% weekly gain. The dollar index stayed strong, even as trade volume thinned out due to holidays. Against the yen, the dollar climbed to 145.91—the highest since April 10—before pulling back to 145.17. Japan’s central bank stayed frozen on rates and slashed growth forecasts, blaming uncertainty from U.S. trade policy. That move hit the yen, which crumbled Thursday. It also suggested Tokyo won’t hike rates again anytime soon until it sees where all this U.S.-China drama lands. Meanwhile, China’s markets stayed shut for a long holiday, but the currency moves elsewhere made it clear where sentiment is headed. Investors are ready to chase risk again, as long as Washington and Beijing stop threatening to blow up trade every other day. Wall Street jumps on trade buzz, tech earnings On Thursday night, S&P 500 futures rose 0.68% after China said it’s weighing trade talks. The Dow futures popped 0.82%, up 337 points. Nasdaq 100 futures rose 0.32%. Markets took the comments as a break from weeks of stress over tariffs, recession talk, and tech weakness. U.S. shares also moved during the day session. The Nasdaq Composite surged 1.5%, erasing all its losses since April 2, the same day Trump started the mess with his “reciprocal” tariffs comment. The S&P 500 gained 0.6%, and the Dow added 0.2%. Both indexes are on an eight-day winning streak. The rally has been helped by a tech sector that’s trying to shake off shaky earnings. That shake-up continued on Thursday. Apple sank 4% in after-hours trading after it missed expectations for revenue from its Services division. It also warned it’s bracing for $900 million in extra costs this quarter, tied to—you guessed it—tariffs. Amazon dropped 2% after putting out weak guidance and blaming “tariffs and trade policies” for the miss. Both firms are part of the so-called “Magnificent Seven,” and their results added more fuel to the tariff fire. Still, not all the earnings news was trash. About two-thirds of S&P 500 companies have reported so far, and 76% have beat earnings forecasts, according to FactSet. That stat helped carry stocks up earlier in the week. Results from Meta and Microsoft in particular gave bulls some energy, and traders went back to betting on AI again. On the economic side, a manufacturing report landed better than feared. It still showed contraction, but the data was less ugly than expected. That helped put a floor under stocks and pushed Treasury yields up slightly. Add in the weaker yen and stronger yuan, and it was enough to get people buying again. Cryptopolitan Academy: Want to grow your money in 2025? Learn how to do it with DeFi in our upcoming webclass.

44059092,https://timestabloid.com/?p=65802,1746173260,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/67/default.png,XRP is positioned to serve as the invisible engine behind global value exchange,https://timestabloid.com/expert-says-people-will-use-xrp-without-even-knowing-it-heres-why/,"Crypto Researcher SMQKE recently published a detailed commentary explaining how the Ripple protocol is designed to serve as an invisible infrastructure for global value transfer, comparing its role to the Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP) in email communication. SMQKE’s post references a document that outlines Ripple’s technical and functional foundations, emphasizing its architecture, purpose, and long-term vision in transforming international finance. The central thesis of SMQKE’s tweet is that XRP will be used by people without their direct awareness, owing to the way Ripple’s protocol operates in the background. The document cited affirms this by stating, “customers of financial institutions do not need to know anything about Ripple or its protocol.” According to the analysis, the Ripple protocol is positioned to operate behind the scenes, enabling real-time, cross-border settlement without requiring end users to interact with or even understand the system, facilitating the transaction. A Universal Protocol for Value Transfer Ripple is described as a universal Internet protocol founded in 2012, aimed at facilitating fast and cost-efficient payments across borders. The document outlines that Ripple allows the transfer of any form of value, including fiat currencies, gold, digital assets, securities, commodities like barrels of oil, and even non-monetary units like hours of electricity and services. SMQKE highlights that this wide range of transferable value sets Ripple apart from traditional financial messaging systems. The SMTP Analogy and Background Functionality The document further asserts that Ripple’s technology operates similarly to SMTP, which allows different email platforms (such as Hotmail or Yahoo) to communicate regardless of the software in use. In the same fashion, Ripple enables disparate financial systems to interact and settle payments without relying on a centralized payment platform. SMQKE points to this analogy to demonstrate how Ripple is not meant to be visible to the user—it simply functions as the transport layer for financial value, just as SMTP is for email. Positioning XRP in the Financial Architecture According to the source, Ripple positions itself not as a payment system or a direct competitor to banks but as a backbone for a new financial architecture. It aims to offer banks and financial institutions a settlement layer that operates independently of the traditional correspondent banking framework. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Ripple Labs, the entity responsible for the protocol, has developed XRP as a native digital asset that can bridge any two currencies or assets, making it easier for institutions to settle obligations instantly and efficiently. An Invisible Engine for Institutions and End Users The network underpinning Ripple is decentralized and composed of servers powering the open-source protocol. The system can transfer virtual liabilities anywhere in the world in approximately six seconds. These liabilities represent fiat or digital currencies, tangible goods, or other value units. SMQKE emphasizes that XRP is uniquely suited for this role as it can serve as a liquidity bridge between assets, allowing seamless exchange without needing pre-funded accounts. Ripple’s design allows it to silently integrate into financial systems. Financial institutions can act as gateways for entering and exiting the network, while customers interacting with their banks or service providers remain unaware that Ripple is enabling their transactions. SMQKE sees this operational invisibility as a critical factor in Ripple’s ability to scale globally, allowing it to function as a foundational infrastructure layer without disrupting front-end user experiences. The conclusion from SMQKE’s commentary is clear: Ripple, through its protocol and XRP, is built to support a reimagined financial system where speed, interoperability, and decentralization are paramount. Its role is to provide the backend connectivity that empowers banks and institutions to transfer value quickly and reliably, without requiring consumer participation or knowledge of the underlying technology.

Over 2.5 hours, they outlined an ambitious $84 billion financing roadmap, combining equity (ATM) and fixed income instruments to both de-risk and leverage the company’s Bitcoin-heavy balance sheet . A key part of this strategy involves new products like Strike and Strife , innovative fixed-income instruments that are perpetual and Bitcoin-backed. Strife, in particular, is structured for long-term holders, offering a 10% dividend with low volatility and no equity dilution, making it highly attractive for traditional investors wary of crypto. Slides from the presentation highlighted why MicroStrategy trades at a premium to Bitcoin NAV—thanks to brand strength, financial engineering, and an expanding ecosystem of derivative products. The team also introduced a Bitcoin credit rating model to show how overcollateralization reduces default risk, pushing these instruments into ""investment-grade"" territory under various BTC price and volatility scenarios. If Bitcoin grows at even 10–30% annually, these instruments—currently undervalued—may offer high yield with minimal risk. Compared to high-risk traditional debt (like PG&E's), MicroStrategy's offerings are positioned as some of the safest, best-yielding instruments in the market , provided the market accepts Bitcoin’s long-term value proposition. This wasn't just an earnings call—it was a financial masterclass in how to structure the future of Bitcoin-powered corporate finance .",,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|TRADING,"{'name': 'Coinpaprika', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/80/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaprika,2025-05-02 08:15:15
