This isn’t science fiction; it’s a real proposal put forward by U.S. Congressman Lance Gooden. This move signals a growing push for integrating cryptocurrencies into more mainstream, and even official, spaces, potentially accelerating Cryptocurrency Adoption in the United States. Why Put Crypto ATMs in Government Spaces? Texas Representative Lance Gooden has formally urged the General Services Administration (GSA), the agency responsible for managing federal properties, to seriously consider the installation of Crypto ATMs within federal buildings. His rationale extends beyond mere convenience. The proposal aligns with a broader, more positive stance towards digital assets advocated by figures like former President Trump, suggesting a political undercurrent to this technological push. Gooden’s argument centers on several key benefits: Innovation Showcase: Placing crypto ATMs could demonstrate the U.S. government’s willingness to embrace financial technology innovation and Blockchain Technology . Identity Verification: Reputable crypto ATM operators often incorporate robust Know Your Customer (KYC) and Anti-Money Laundering (AML) protocols, potentially offering a secure method for transactions with verified identities. Transaction Transparency: While often perceived as anonymous, blockchain transactions are inherently transparent on the public ledger, offering a traceable record for regulatory purposes. This proposal aims to normalize the use of digital assets by making them accessible in familiar, official locations, potentially fostering greater trust and encouraging wider Cryptocurrency Adoption among the general public. Navigating the Waters of US Crypto Regulation While the vision of accessible crypto in federal buildings is compelling, the reality is complex, especially concerning US Crypto Regulation . The cryptocurrency landscape in the U.S. is currently fragmented, with various federal and state agencies asserting jurisdiction. The regulatory environment for Crypto ATMs specifically has been a point of concern. CoinDesk reported that Gooden’s proposal comes amid ongoing discussions and concerns regarding crypto ATM-related fraud and their potential use in illicit activities. Regulatory bodies like the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) classify crypto ATM operators as money transmitters, subjecting them to specific registration, reporting, and compliance requirements. However, enforcement and oversight remain challenging. Key regulatory hurdles include: Ensuring consistent and effective KYC/AML compliance across potentially thousands of machines. Addressing the risk of scams where users are directed to deposit money into crypto ATMs. Clarifying which specific digital assets would be supported and their regulatory status (e.g., securities vs. commodities). Integrating these operations with existing federal building security and financial protocols. Any implementation would require close coordination between the GSA, FinCEN, the SEC, the CFTC, and potentially state regulators, highlighting the intricate nature of US Crypto Regulation . Understanding Blockchain Technology and Crypto ATMs At its core, a Crypto ATM is a kiosk that allows individuals to exchange cash or debit card funds for cryptocurrency, or vice versa, facilitating interaction with Blockchain Technology . Unlike traditional bank ATMs that connect to your bank account, crypto ATMs connect to cryptocurrency exchanges or wallets to perform transactions on the blockchain network. Here’s a simplified look at how they generally work: User Interaction: The user selects the cryptocurrency they want to buy or sell. Identity Verification: For compliance, the ATM typically requires identity verification, often via a phone number, ID scan, or even biometrics for larger transactions. Transaction: Buying Crypto: The user inserts cash or uses a debit card. The ATM sends the crypto to the user’s digital wallet address (often provided via a QR code scan). Selling Crypto: The user sends crypto from their wallet to the ATM’s address. Once confirmed on the blockchain, the ATM dispenses cash. Blockchain Confirmation: The transaction is processed and confirmed on the respective blockchain ledger, leveraging the decentralized and transparent nature of Blockchain Technology . The global network of Crypto ATMs has grown significantly, providing a physical touchpoint for accessing the digital asset space. Placing them in highly visible federal buildings could significantly boost public awareness and interaction with this technology. Potential Impact on Cryptocurrency Adoption Introducing Crypto ATMs into federal buildings could have a substantial, albeit perhaps symbolic, impact on Cryptocurrency Adoption . Federal buildings are perceived as secure, official, and accessible public spaces. Seeing crypto services offered there could lend an air of legitimacy to digital assets for many who remain skeptical or unfamiliar. Consider the potential ripple effects: Increased Visibility: Exposure to cryptocurrency beyond online platforms or niche retail locations. Perceived Legitimacy: Association with government buildings might reduce public fear of scams or illegitimacy. Accessibility: Providing a physical, potentially easier on-ramp for individuals less comfortable with online exchanges. Educational Opportunity: While not explicitly educational kiosks, their presence could spark curiosity and encourage learning about crypto and Blockchain Technology . However, the actual impact on widespread adoption would depend heavily on the number of machines installed, their functionality, transaction limits, fees, and the public’s reaction. It’s a step that could either be a catalyst for broader acceptance or remain a niche service within government facilities. Challenges and Criticisms Despite the potential benefits, the proposal faces significant challenges and attracts criticism. Beyond the regulatory hurdles mentioned earlier, practical and security concerns abound. Security Risks: Federal buildings have stringent security protocols. Integrating third-party kiosks, especially those handling financial transactions involving volatile assets, adds layers of complexity. Physical security of the machines themselves is also a factor. Cost and Maintenance: Who bears the cost of installation, maintenance, security, and compliance for these machines? The GSA or the private operators? Public Perception: While some may see this as innovation, others might view it skeptically, associating crypto with risks or illicit activities, potentially drawing negative attention to federal facilities. Limited Scope: Crypto ATMs typically offer basic buy/sell functions for a limited number of cryptocurrencies. They don’t represent the full spectrum of digital asset use cases (DeFi, NFTs, etc.). Regulatory Uncertainty: The evolving nature of US Crypto Regulation means that rules governing these machines could change, impacting their operation or legality within federal spaces. Critics might argue that federal buildings are not appropriate venues for commercial financial services, especially those as volatile and regulation-sensitive as cryptocurrency. They might suggest that promoting Cryptocurrency Adoption is not a core function of the GSA. What Happens Next? Representative Gooden’s proposal is currently a request to the General Services Administration. The GSA would need to evaluate the feasibility, security implications, costs, and alignment with federal policy and US Crypto Regulation . This process could involve studies, consultations with other government agencies, and potentially pilot programs. The political dimension is also noteworthy. Aligning the proposal with a pro-crypto stance from a former president suggests it could become a talking point in broader political discussions about technology and finance. The outcome will likely depend on the GSA’s assessment, the evolving regulatory landscape, and the political will to push such an initiative forward. This proposal serves as a tangible example of how proponents of digital assets are actively seeking ways to integrate them into the physical and institutional fabric of the country, pushing the boundaries of where and how we interact with Blockchain Technology . Conclusion: A Step Towards Mainstream? The proposal to install Crypto ATMs in Federal Buildings is a bold statement about the potential future of finance and Cryptocurrency Adoption in the United States. It highlights the increasing desire to bridge the gap between traditional financial systems and the burgeoning world of digital assets powered by Blockchain Technology . While the stated benefits of innovation, identity verification, and transparency are compelling, the path is fraught with challenges, particularly concerning the complex landscape of US Crypto Regulation and security concerns. Whether this proposal comes to fruition remains to be seen. However, it undeniably pushes the conversation forward regarding the role of cryptocurrencies in public spaces and within official government perception. It’s a move that could, if successful, significantly normalize digital asset use, or, if unsuccessful, underscore the significant hurdles still facing widespread integration.

The total crypto market capitalization rose 8.5% since March. Cryptocurrency traders have frequently zoomed in on the need for crypto to show a clear “ decoupling ” from the stock market, and over the past 10 days, the intraday movements of Bitcoin ( BTC ) and major altcoins have closely tracked those of the S&P 500, even as trade war developments have dominated market sentiment. S&P 500 futures (left) vs. Total crypto cap, USD (right). Source: TradingView/Cointelegraph A decoupling would validate digital assets as an independent class and address growing concerns about a potential global economic recession. This ongoing correlation has led market participants to question whether the cryptocurrency market is destined to follow the stock market’s lead indefinitely, and what conditions would be necessary for a genuine decoupling to occur. Stock market shows strength despite trade tensions The S&P 500 reached its peak on Feb. 19 and has since struggled to reclaim the 5,800 level, a support that had held for four months. Despite persistent pressure from US trade disputes with Canada and Mexico, as well as the imposition of new tariffs affecting nearly every major economic region, equities have demonstrated notable resilience. Chinese state media recently reported that the United States has quietly initiated trade negotiations. Although China officially maintains a 125% retaliatory tariff on US imports, it has granted waivers for sectors such as ethane, semiconductors, and certain pharmaceuticals. The United States, in turn, has partially exempted automakers from new tariffs. These actions suggest that both sides are gradually making concessions. There is a reasonable possibility that the S&P 500 established a bottom at 4,835 on April 7, with further gains from the current 5,635 level remaining plausible. The stock market has responded positively to robust first-quarter earnings, as companies adapt to tariffs by relocating production outside China or expanding operations within the United States. For instance, Microsoft reported a 13.2% year-over-year increase in revenue, with higher margins and strong demand for artificial intelligence. Meta also delivered earnings and revenue that exceeded market expectations on April 30. These results have alleviated concerns about a potential AI bubble or the risk that the trade war could force companies to reduce investment. The market’s focus shifts to the Federal Reserve Rather than concentrating on the recent decline in US PMI manufacturing data-which reached a five-month low in April, market participants are closely monitoring the Federal Reserve’s next policy moves. Following a year of balance sheet reduction, the Fed is now considering asset purchases to help ease selling pressure. An increase in liquidity is typically favorable for risk-oriented assets. Therefore, even if a full decoupling does not occur, cryptocurrencies could still benefit from a more supportive macroeconomic environment. S&P 500 futures (left) vs. Total crypto cap, USD (right). Source: TradingView/Cointelegraph Despite the short-term correlation, the cryptocurrency market has outperformed equities in recent months. Since March, the total crypto market capitalization has risen by 8.5%, while the S&P 500 has declined by 5.3%. Over a six-month period, this divergence becomes even more pronounced: the total crypto market cap is up 29%, while the S&P 500 is down 2%. It is therefore inaccurate to suggest that these markets move in perfect synchrony, particularly when viewed over longer timeframes. Related: Bitcoin to $1M by 2029 fueled by ETF and gov’t demand — Bitwise exec It is still premature to declare a definitive bottom for the S&P 500 or to conclude that the trade war has been resolved. An economic recession would likely have negative implications for both markets. However, the current strength in equities indicates reduced risk aversion among investors. For the time being, the elevated correlation between cryptocurrencies and stocks may represent the most favorable scenario.

Bitcoin’s resilience above the psychological $90,000–$95,000 level, an unexpected surge in stablecoin issuance and a swarm of textbook bullish patterns across large-caps and meme names have converged to create what veteran chartist Josh Olszewicz calls “one of the cleanest multi-asset breakout tapes we’ve seen since late 2023.” Crypto Bull Run Back? Olszewicz’s argument begins and ends with liquidity. Two consecutive one-billion-dollar Tether mints on 29 April pushed combined USDT + USDC supply to a fresh all-time high, an event he frames as an unequivocal tailwind for speculative assets. “Tether’s been printing, printing, and minting, baby,” he said, emphasising that the dual $1 billion tranches arrived alongside a clear premium in the USDT/USD pair on Kraken—evidence, in his view, of real demand rather than opportunistic treasury rebalancing. “Typically that means people are deploying it in alts. That’s why stable-coin mints—specifically Tether—[are] generally bullish for alts because people are using it to speculate.” The liquidity pulse arrives just as several macro obstacles appear to be receding. Bitcoin survived a negative-print US GDP release, sticky PCE inflation data and what Olszewicz called “some jobs numbers that came out this week,” without surrendering its three-month up-trend. Meanwhile gold has rolled over and the Dollar Index remains pinned near cycle lows, recreating the “everything-rally” backdrop that powered crypto’s late-2023 melt-up. Funding markets, however, are delivering a curious split: “We still have negative funding on the BTC side on crypto exchanges. We have positive funding in legacy land with futures. So that’s very bizarre right now, but so far so good.” Against that backdrop, Olszewicz drills into the Ichimoku-cloud mechanics that underpin his altcoin watch-list. The premise is as old as the indicator itself: a daily candle close inside the cloud accompanied by a bullish Tenkan-Kijun (TK) cross triggers a mean-reversion target to the opposing edge of the cloud. “All these trades are always the same. I never treat them differently,” he said. “You get a better entry… it’s just a game of probabilities.” The strategy sets clear invalidations—either the Kijun line or a lower-low—and provides what he characterises as Dow-theory mean-reversion framed through an Ichimoku lens. That formula is now flashing across a surprising breadth of assets. Solana And Curve Solana sits at the top of his list. The layer-one token has posted six consecutive red daily candles, sculpting the “right shoulder” of an inverted head-and-shoulders whose neckline rises toward $200. “What I’ve got to laser focus on is this potential edge-to-edge move,” he explained, noting that ideal entries would materialise between $140 and $120 but are not essential. “Within the next week or two, you should get a great signal on an entry here on SOL just from the cloud.” Related Reading: XRP Gains Ground in Weekly Crypto Inflows as Ethereum Continues Downtrend Curve, by contrast, is already in motion—up double-digits on a day when most altcoins bled. “Why is it up 10 percent today and everything else is down? I don’t have a good answer for that,” he admitted. Yet the technical structure leaves little to interpret: a multi-month flat-bottom accumulation, a candle close inside the cloud near its lower boundary and a bullish TK cross. “You’re on your journey to somewhere up here—the other edge of the cloud,” he said, implying a measured-move objective near $1.20 that would represent a near-doubling from current levels. Ethereum And Litecoin Where Solana and Curve show imminent triggers, Ethereum remains the quintessential laggard, still chiselling out what Olszewicz labels a bottoming process. “It’s going to take ETH kicking and screaming to get started here but this is a bottom in process. Certainly may take you into June.” The calculus is familiar: traders intent on rotation may find better risk-adjusted returns elsewhere, returning to ETH only once its own daily cloud admits a candle close. Litecoin exhibits a similar dynamic, with an inverted head-and-shoulders outline that “feels a little early,” perhaps ripening by early June. FET, LINK, ALGO Fetch.ai breached the cloud on April 23 and already sports a bullish TK cross, yet Olszewicz acknowledges it arrives “after two or three weeks of up-move,” reducing risk-reward. Related Reading: CoinGecko Q1 Report: Top 10 Crypto Exchanges See Spot Trading Volume Drop To $5.4 Trillion Chainlink shows a textbook right-shoulder still under construction—“alerts at fifteen,” he suggests—while Algorand edges toward a 32-cent cloud target, one daily close away from confirmation. In each instance, the analyst reiterates that until the formal triggers print, the probability of follow-through remains statistically lower. DOGE, PEPE And WIF The most combustible corner of the market—the meme cohort—is, in his telling, already foreshadowing a retail return. Dogecoin intrigues him most. “Along with ENA, one of the best bang for your bucks is Doge,” he said, though he concedes the pattern needs another week to sculpt a complete right-shoulder. He is explicit about his trigger: “Give it another week or two and this is definitely one of the better-looking setups,” with attention fixed on the $0.175 area. PEPE presents fewer moving parts: it is inside the cloud with a bullish TK cross and a clear neckline at the Kijun. “If ETH even sneezes higher, I expect this to just be up twenty-five percent one day,” he said, while cautioning that a transitional “negative twenty percent day” could precede the pop. WIF, for its part, is “slamming against the cloud,” on the cusp of its own TK cross. Having retraced from $4.80 to current levels, it offers what he calls “a great-looking setup,” albeit one where “the greed in me always wants an entry down here”—a reference to a hypothetical bid parked at the cloud’s lower edge. BTC Dominance Bitcoin dominance, still pressing cycle highs, complicates the rotation narrative. “Does it really matter that you’re not all-in BTC if this is an extreme in dominance?” he asked rhetorically. His answer is temporal. Dominance mattered enormously at the October 2023 bottom, and he suspects it will matter again once it rolls over. “Come May, June, I think we will start to see the outperformance of the altcoins,” he predicts, but he tempers that with a blunt reminder: “It hasn’t made sense to sit in these BTC pairs.” The exception is Solana’s BTC chart, which mirrors the USD thesis with a half-formed inverted head-and-shoulders and a cloud target significantly higher. At press time, SOL traded at $151.90.

44043167,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=154487,1746140427,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Coinbase MOVE Trading: Urgent Suspension Announced,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/coinbase-move-trading-alert/,"Heads up, crypto traders! If you’re involved in Coinbase MOVE trading , there’s an important update you need to know. Coinbase has announced an upcoming change that will directly impact your ability to trade the MOVE token on their platform. What’s Happening with Coinbase MOVE Trading? Coinbase recently shared via their official X account that they will be suspending trading for the MOVE token. This isn’t just a temporary pause; it’s a complete halt to trading activities for this specific asset on their exchange. The suspension is scheduled to take place on May 15 at 2 PM ET . After this time, you will no longer be able to buy, sell, or trade MOVE tokens using Coinbase’s trading services. According to CoinGecko data at the time of the original announcement, the MOVE token was trading around $0.2303, experiencing a 3.2% dip over the preceding 24 hours. News like a trading suspension crypto can often influence market price, so it’s crucial for holders to be aware of the deadline. Why Does Coinbase Delisting Happen? Coinbase explained that this decision stems from their regular process of monitoring listed assets. They continuously evaluate cryptocurrencies on their platform to ensure they meet the exchange’s stringent listing criteria. When an asset no longer meets these standards, a Coinbase delisting becomes a possibility. The reasons behind a crypto delisting can vary. They often include factors such as: Failure to meet technical requirements (e.g., network issues, wallet support problems). Low trading volume and liquidity, making it difficult for users to trade effectively. Concerns about the project’s development, team, or future viability. Regulatory or compliance issues. Security vulnerabilities. Changes in market conditions or user demand. While Coinbase’s statement specifically mentioned ‘meeting listing criteria,’ the exact criteria that MOVE failed to meet were not detailed in the initial announcement. This is standard practice, as exchanges typically don’t disclose the specific reasons for each individual delisting. Impact of MOVE Token Delisting on Holders For anyone holding MOVE tokens on Coinbase, the most immediate impact of the MOVE token delisting is the loss of the ability to trade the asset on that specific platform after the May 15 deadline. This can affect liquidity and convenience. Key Considerations for Holders: Trading Stops: You won’t be able to execute buy or sell orders for MOVE on Coinbase after 2 PM ET on May 15. Withdrawals: While trading is suspended, users are typically still allowed to withdraw their affected tokens for a period after the suspension date. It is absolutely critical to check official communications from Coinbase regarding the withdrawal window. Don’t assume you have unlimited time. Price Volatility: Delisting announcements can sometimes lead to increased selling pressure on the affected asset on that specific exchange as holders look to offload before the deadline. Finding Alternatives: If you wish to continue holding or trading MOVE, you will need to withdraw your tokens to a private wallet or another exchange that supports MOVE trading. It’s important to remember that a delisting from one exchange, even a major one like Coinbase, doesn’t necessarily mean the token is dead or delisted everywhere. However, it does reduce accessibility and can impact market perception. Understanding Trading Suspension Crypto in Broader Context A trading suspension crypto is a measure exchanges take for various reasons, sometimes temporarily due to technical upgrades or network issues, and sometimes permanently as a prelude to full delisting. In this case, the announcement clearly indicates a permanent suspension of trading, leading to the effective delisting of MOVE from the platform. This isn’t the first time Coinbase, or any major exchange, has delisted an asset. It’s a necessary part of managing a dynamic cryptocurrency platform and portfolio. While inconvenient for affected users, it’s presented by exchanges as a way to maintain platform integrity and user safety. What Should MOVE Holders on Coinbase Do? Actionable Insights If you hold MOVE tokens on Coinbase, here are the crucial steps you should take immediately: Check Your Email/Coinbase Account: Look for official communication from Coinbase. They will provide detailed instructions regarding the suspension and, most importantly, the process and deadline for withdrawing your MOVE tokens. Decide Your Next Step: Do you want to sell your MOVE before the May 15 deadline? Do you want to withdraw it to a private wallet? Do you want to send it to another exchange that lists MOVE? Make a decision based on your investment strategy. Execute Your Plan Before the Deadline: If you plan to sell on Coinbase, do so before May 15, 2 PM ET. If you plan to withdraw, initiate the withdrawal well in advance of the deadline to avoid any last-minute issues. Ensure you have a secure wallet address or the correct deposit address for the receiving exchange. Be Aware of Fees: Factor in any withdrawal fees if you decide to move your tokens off the platform. Ignoring the deadline could result in your assets becoming inaccessible for trading on Coinbase, forcing you into a withdrawal process that might have its own time limits. Conclusion: Navigating the MOVE Suspension The announcement of the Coinbase MOVE trading suspension on May 15 at 2 PM ET is a significant event for holders of the token on the platform. This decision, based on Coinbase’s ongoing review of assets against their listing standards, means the MOVE token delisting is imminent for the exchange. While crypto delisting and trading suspension crypto events are part of the volatile nature of the market, they require prompt action from affected users. Ensure you understand the implications, check official Coinbase communications, and take the necessary steps to manage your MOVE tokens before the deadline.

The company is developing a full stack bitcoin mining platform, enhancing product velocity with open-source AI, and driving operating leverage in-house banking services. XYZ stock's valuation is attractive, trading at extremely low multiples despite solid growth prospects and impressive operating efficiency. The market misunderstands Block's bitcoin strategy, creating an asymmetric risk/reward opportunity as the company deepens its ecosystem and enhances financial accessibility. Shares of Fintech Block, Inc. ( XYZ ) cratered after the company reported weaker than expected earnings and slashed guidance . The report is definitely weaker than bulls like myself had hoped for, but it is illustrative of the challenging macro environment we are in. Despite this, I remain very optimistic about the company's long-term growth runway and see the vision that they are building quite clearly. The negatives in this report are clear: slowing gross profit growth, downward guidance revision, no growth in Cash App card users or transacting actives, high stock-based comp expense, and slowing GPV (gross payment volume) growth. The market has plenty of reasons to punish the stock after this report, but I still see several reasons to remain optimistic. For one, management believes the bottom is in for gross profit growth and expects 12% YoY growth for 2025 as a whole. Meanwhile, the market is completely ignoring the ongoing profitability inflection Block is enjoying. The company demonstrated strong operating leverage in its subscription and services line item, growing revenue by over $200m YoY (+12.5% YoY) while segment COGS grew only 2%. Segment gross margin grew from 83.9% to 85.5% YoY. Segment contributions here grew YoY from both Square and Cash App, and I maintain the conviction that this line item is the future driver of Block's growth. It's the key to a sustainable profitability inflection for the company, and recent news regarding Cash App Borrow, discussed below, will begin driving strong operating leverage in this line item. Block's highest margin segment is growing the fastest. This counts for something, despite the meager overall growth rates. Q1 Shareholder Letter Finally, management expects its first gross profit contributions from the Proto segment by year-end. This segment will capture sales of its bitcoin mining chip that is expected to begin recognizing revenue in 2H 2025. I wrote on Block earlier this year stating that the Bitcoin inflection is looming . I rated the stock a Strong Buy. The stock has underperformed the S&P (SP500) by a wide margin to date, and that underperformance is only widening in the post-market carnage. In this article, I stand by that rating. Core to my thesis is that Block is setting up critical infrastructure for an economy that sees increasing mainstream adoption of Bitcoin. The company is building a full stack bitcoin mining platform with an MDK (Mining Development Kit), a custom mining chip, and software to help more people access the bitcoin mining ecosystem. Although my previous rating has not worked in my favor to date, I maintain a strong belief that Block is a defining company in an era that is becoming increasingly friendly to cryptocurrency. I have a few other articles that are important to a discussion on Block's crypto opportunity. Namely, my article on MicroStrategy Incorporated ( MSTR ), and my recent Strong Buy rating on Bitcoin USD (BTC-USD) itself. For all intents and purposes, MSTR stock is effectively levered bitcoin. Bitcoin USD ((BTC-USD)) itself, at current, is essentially a call option on geopolitical turmoil and the erosion of trust in the US Dollar as a neutral mechanism for global trade. There has never been such a structurally bullish time for Bitcoin, considering the current U.S. administration is weaponizing its consumer base and reserve currency. Meanwhile, that same U.S. president has been outspoken on his desire to make the United States the crypto capital of the world . New York City, the financial capital of the world, is hosting its first-ever Crypto Summit this month. This article will not focus so heavily on Bitcoin. Clearly, the market is unimpressed with Block's maverick status within the crypto sphere, it doesn't care about the company's bitcoin accumulation, nor the fact that it enriches its user base by making bitcoin accessible, nor that it is becoming the first U.S. supplier of Bitcoin mining hardware. This misunderstanding by the market has led to a significant mispricing which is only exacerbated by today's selloff. I'd point you to my three aforementioned articles for a deeper understanding of my position on this mispricing. My Take Block has received an enormous amount of criticism stemming mostly from its poor stock performance. Investors are losing patience with CEO Jack Dorsey and the company's perceived lack of progress. While sales growth has stalled from the COVID-era boom, the stock's valuation has fallen more than enough at this point to compensate. The company traded at only 13.5x forward earnings and 11.6x forward cash flow before the post-market selloff today. The valuation is even more attractive now. Analysts expect Block to grow EPS in the double digits for the next several years. Further, Block's impressive operating efficiency is best illustrated by the fact that it generates over 180% more net income per employee than its sector peers. I believe now is a great time to either accumulate Block stock or initiate a position. For those unconvinced by the fundamentals of a compelling valuation, a growth reversal, and respectable efficiency, let's talk about the product velocity we've seen out of the company this year. For one, Block is the only Fintech (to my knowledge) that is openly embracing and developing its own open-source AI model, dubbed codename:goose . This is powered by the company's NVIDIA Corporation ( NVDA ) GB200 cluster. Internally, Block is using goose mostly for software engineering, but the potential for AI throughout Block's ecosystem is very promising. Goose will contribute to ongoing increases in product velocity and innovation. Over time, the company can lean into goose for fraud analytics, streamlining loan approvals, marketing ad targeting, and helping Square sellers create websites and marketing campaigns. It noted in the shareholder letter that it wants Cash App users and Square sellers to have a personal CFO and COO at their fingertips. Further, there was news recently that is important for Block's ongoing profitability inflection that went entirely ignored by the market. The company's in-house bank, Square Financial Services (""SFS""), received FDIC approval to provide Cash App Borrow loans. The company had previously partnered with an external bank for its nearly $9b in origination volume for this product in 2024. Bringing the servicing of these loans in-house enhances Block's unit economics by cutting out that intermediary. In other words, we can expect ongoing growth in the company's subscription and services gross margin. Management also noted that they are open to selling these loans off their book to maintain flexibility with their available capital. Combining this improvement in unit economics with the company's increased inflow and gross profit per user makes me confident they will continue growing subscription and services revenue and gross margin. The average Cash App Borrow loan was less than $100 and less than a month in duration in 2024. These are microloans aiming to replace payday loans which are outright predatory, considering they charge interest based on a fee structure , and have a clear product/market fit. Cash App Borrow has less than a 3% default rate historically. Very low risk. SFS has been servicing Square small business loans since it received its bank charter in 2021 and has seen solid success with its innovative repayment structure. Square sellers pay loans back slowly with a small percentage of each sale going to loan repayment. This greatly de-risks the company's credit book from the lending perspective, makes the loan easier to manage for Square sellers, and makes credit more accessible for small businesses. Block also recently released enhanced cashflow management capabilities for Square sellers, including savings recommendations for prudent expense management, and launched a new unified interface for full stack point-of-sale services. It's been a busy month of announcements for the company. Despite headcount reductions throughout 2024 , the company has actually increased product velocity. The company is operating with a renewed focus under the unified leadership of founder-CEO Jack Dorsey, and sits at three key inflection points with AI, the mass accessibility of financial services, and the proliferation of bitcoin as a means for cross-border settlement and as a modern savings vehicle. The market doesn't seem to understand the operating leverage that Block is achieving through these handfuls of initiatives. This gives investors who recognize these enhancements a wonderful opportunity to accumulate shares in an innovative technology company with a very compressed multiple. Investor Takeaway Owning Block stock has been frustrating for the past several years. Many long-term investors have grown impatient with the company's leadership and the lack of stock returns. I believe this only strengthens the bull case for the stock, considering we are at the point of broad-based market fear and capitulation in the stock. The company has been head-down and in the weeds driving product enhancements to better serve its growing customer base, while driving operating efficiency and enhanced unit economics. Broad-based weakness during Q1 and the ongoing uncertainty in Q2 drove weaker than expected results and guidance, and another frustrating selloff. I believe this selloff is a gift. The company is growing a durable extremely high margin segment in the double digits while deploying AI throughout its internal operations and products to increase innovation and value for customers. Further, the market seems to regard the company's bitcoin aspirations as a distraction. I couldn't disagree more. The company is becoming the first mining chip provider based in the U.S., the largest mining chip company is currently a Chinese chip designer, while deepening the accessibility of bitcoin throughout its ecosystem. Over time, as public perception of Bitcoin turns more favorable, Block will have several levers to facilitate the mass adoption of Bitcoin in cross-border trade, peer-to-peer payments, and retail transactions. The market is impatient with management's lack of focus on short-term profitability growth. Instead, management remains focused on achieving its mission of enhancing the accessibility of the modern economy for all people. This has created very durable, sticky customer relationships with both low-income consumers and small-to-medium sized businesses. The obvious risk with this strategy is that these consumers and businesses are the most sensitive to inflation and recessionary macro conditions. Now, the company has shifted focus to deepening relationships with Cash App consumers, leaning more heavily into banking services for both Cash App and Square, and building the infrastructure on which the Bitcoin economy will operate in the U.S. There is much to look forward to in Block's future. I maintain my Strong Buy rating despite the poor results from today.",BTC-USD|XYZ,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|FIAT|MARKET|MINING,"{'name': 'Seeking Alpha', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/seekingalpha.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",seekingalpha,2025-05-01 23:05:30
44043438,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=154488,1746141025,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Fivetran Acquisition of Census Creates Complete Data Movement Platform,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/fivetran-census-acquisition/,"In the fast-paced world of technology, where data is king for everything from blockchain analytics to operational efficiency, the infrastructure enabling smooth data flow is paramount. This is true for crypto enterprises and traditional businesses alike. A significant development in this crucial area is the recent news: Fivetran , a leader in automated data integration, has acquired Census, a prominent Reverse ETL platform. This move is set to transform how businesses manage their data, promising an end-to-end data movement platform . Understanding the Fivetran and Census Acquisition For over a decade, Fivetran has specialized in Extract, Transform, Load (ETL) processes, helping companies consolidate data from numerous sources into cloud data warehouses. Census, founded more recently in 2018, tackles the opposite challenge: Reverse ETL. It enables businesses to move data *out* of data warehouses and into operational tools like CRM, marketing automation, and support systems. The Census acquisition by Fivetran brings these two complementary capabilities under one roof. Why is this combination important? Complete Data Loop: Previously, companies often needed separate vendors for ETL (getting data in) and Reverse ETL (getting data out). The acquisition creates a single vendor for the entire data journey. Customer Demand: Fivetran’s CEO, George Fraser, stated that customers had been requesting a Reverse ETL solution for years, making this acquisition a direct response to market needs. Simplified Stack: Businesses can potentially simplify their data infrastructure stack, reducing complexity and vendor management overhead. Why This Move Made Sense: The Power of Reverse ETL Integrating a robust Reverse ETL solution was a strategic priority for Fivetran. While they considered building their own, they recognized the value of bringing in a company like Census that had already perfected the technology. Fraser highlighted that the underlying technical challenges for standard ETL and Reverse ETL are quite distinct, despite both involving data movement. Furthermore, the synergy between the two companies was clear. Fivetran and Census shared a significant number of customers. According to Fraser, customers who preferred Fivetran’s approach to data integration were also likely to appreciate Census’s philosophy regarding operational data sync. This shared customer base and similar product philosophies made Census a natural fit for Fivetran’s expansion. Building an End-to-End Data Movement Platform The goal is to build a truly comprehensive data movement platform . Once the acquisition is finalized, the Census team will join Fivetran, and the Census brand will be integrated into the Fivetran offering. This isn’t just about adding a feature; it’s about creating a unified experience for customers needing to move data in any direction. The deal terms were not disclosed, but Census had raised over $80 million in funding and was last valued at $630 million in 2022. The long-standing relationship between the founding teams also played a role, dating back to their time in the Y Combinator program. This acquisition is a significant development in the enterprise data landscape, providing businesses with a more streamlined and powerful way to leverage their data assets, from getting data into their warehouse to operationalizing it across their organization. For companies operating in data-intensive fields like cryptocurrency, having reliable and efficient data infrastructure is non-negotiable for growth and compliance.

The trade offer aims to increase imports of American goods and ease the transatlantic trade deficit. The drama from the Trump tariffs is still ongoing, and the EU is now pushing for what it considers a fair and balanced deal before July, when the tariffs will take effect. The EU’s strategic offer According to Maroš Šefčovič, the EU’s trade commissioner, the European Union is proposing a €50B increase in purchases of U.S. goods. The €50B investment is aimed at easing the growing trade tensions with Washington. Šefčovič told the Financial Times that the EU is making “certain progress” in its negotiations with the U.S. The EU however made it clear that it will not accept the 10% tariff recently imposed by President Donald Trump as a fair outcome. The proposal will also help to close what the U.S. perceives as a €50B trade deficit with Europe. Šefčovič stated this trade gap could be quickly closed if Europe increased its imports of American goods such as its liquefied natural gas (LNG), soybeans, and other agricultural products. “If what we are looking at as a problem in the deficit is €50B, I believe that we can really solve this problem very quickly,” he said. The bloc has been working to prevent a full-blown transatlantic trade war since Trump’s announcement of a 10% tariff on most countries on April 2. The U.S. government also proposed a 20% “reciprocal” tariff for the EU. The extra 20% tariffs were eventually suspended to allow 90 days for negotiation, but the initial 10% tariff remains in place, and further duties could be added on in July if no agreement is reached between the nations. Šefčovič explained that the EU is working on a deal that is “balanced and fair,” not one that locks in high tariffs. “It will be very difficult to reach a deal that is clearly good and acceptable for our member states and our European parliament,” he said. Retaliatory measures are still on the table The EU has so far embraced diplomacy during the trade talks, but the bloc did not neglect preparing for the worst. The European Commission, the agency responsible for negotiating trade deals on behalf of the EU’s 27 member states, has outlined both incentives for a deal and retaliatory measures in the event that negotiations fall through. On the topic of retaliatory measures, the EU has a €21B retaliatory tariff package ready for American goods such as Harley-Davidson motorcycles, poultry, and clothing. The tariff is currently paused until July 14. “We will be working meticulously with every member state to have a robust response, which would have unanimous support,” Šefčovič said. The Commission recently briefed its ambassadors on both negotiation tactics like carrots and sticks in a bid to prepare the bloc for any outcome. Šefčovič emphasized that while the EU is pushing for a resolution, it stands firm in rejecting tariffs it deems unfair. When he was asked directly if the EU would accept a 10% tariff baseline as a compromise, Šefčovič responded that such a level is “very high.” The EU has shown that it is open to adjustments and carve-outs announced by the U.S. government. Adjustments include changes such as relief for the automotive sector. Šefčovič suggested that that was likely in response to warnings about a potential economic fallout. Šefčovič also stated that the EU is open to cooperating with the U.S. on broader global trade challenges, including those related to China. He proposed working together to address issues like steel and aluminum overcapacity, semiconductor development, and reducing dependency on critical raw materials. “We believe that we can actually achieve a lot together,” Šefčovič said.

44043742,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=154489,1746141621,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Anthropic Claude Unveils Powerful New AI Integrations,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/anthropic-claude-integrations/,"The world of artificial intelligence is constantly evolving, with leading models pushing boundaries to offer more utility. For those following the intersection of AI and technology, Anthropic’s recent updates to their AI Chatbot , Claude, represent a significant step forward. These enhancements aim to make Claude a more powerful and interconnected tool for users across various plans. What are Anthropic Claude’s New AI Integrations? Anthropic has introduced a new feature called Integrations, available in beta for users on Claude Max, Team, and Enterprise plans (and coming soon to Pro). This builds upon Anthropic’s existing MCP protocol, which allows AI models to access data from various sources. Integrations take this further, enabling developers to create and host app servers that expand Claude’s abilities. Users can then discover and connect these servers directly to Anthropic Claude . Think of it this way: instead of just chatting with Claude, you can now allow it to interact with the tools you use daily. Anthropic highlights that connecting your tools gives Claude crucial context about your work, understanding project histories, task statuses, and organizational knowledge. This allows the Claude AI to potentially take actions or retrieve specific information directly from those connected platforms. Key Integration Examples: Atlassian: Enables Claude to summarize and create pages within Confluence. Zapier: Allows Claude to trigger actions within Zapier’s vast network of app automation workflows. Other Partners: Initial partners also include Cloudflare, Intercom, Square, and PayPal, each adding unique capabilities. These AI Integrations are designed to streamline workflows and make Claude a central hub for interacting with your digital environment. Exploring Advanced AI Research Capabilities Alongside Integrations, Anthropic also launched an expanded deep research capability called Advanced Research. This tool is designed to provide more comprehensive reports on a given topic by crawling a multitude of internal and external sources. While Anthropic’s previous research tool was fast, Advanced Research takes more time (from five to 45 minutes) to deliver deeper insights. This enhancement is particularly relevant as AI models, including the AI Chatbot landscape, increasingly incorporate ‘reasoning’ abilities. These models can break down complex problems and fact-check information, crucial skills for conducting in-depth research. Advanced Research leverages this, allowing Claude to investigate different parts of a request before compiling a detailed report. How Advanced Research Works: Breaks down complex requests into smaller components. Investigates each part deeply across hundreds of sources. Compiles findings into a comprehensive report. Provides clear citations linking back to original source material. Can utilize newly expanded connectors, including Integrations and local systems via the desktop app. This focus on thoroughness and source citation positions Advanced AI Research as a valuable tool for users needing detailed information and verification. Keeping Pace in the Competitive AI Landscape These new features, AI Integrations and Advanced Research, are part of Anthropic’s broader strategy to remain competitive with other leading models like Google’s Gemini and OpenAI’s ChatGPT. The AI market is rapidly advancing, and continuous innovation is necessary to attract and retain users, especially those on higher-tier plans. Anthropic reportedly has ambitious revenue goals, aiming for $34.5 billion by 2027, significantly up from their reported $1.4 billion annualized revenue in early March. Expanding the capabilities of Anthropic Claude through features like deeper research and app connectivity is key to achieving such growth by offering more value to enterprise and team users. Conclusion: A More Connected and Capable Claude Anthropic’s introduction of Integrations and the enhanced Advanced Research tool marks a significant evolution for the Claude AI . By allowing users to connect Claude to their essential apps and empowering it with deeper, more thorough research capabilities, Anthropic is making its AI Chatbot a more practical and powerful assistant for complex tasks. These updates are crucial steps for Anthropic as it navigates the competitive AI landscape and works towards its growth objectives, offering users more reasons to choose Claude for their advanced AI needs.

44044047,https://cryptonews.com/?p=356726,1746142200,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/52/44044047.jpeg,South Korean Regulator Designates Crypto Exchange Bithumb as a Conglomerate,https://cryptonews.com/news/south-korean-regulator-designates-crypto-exchange-bithumb-as-a-conglomerate/,"The South Korean Fair Trade Commission (FTC) has classified the crypto exchange Bithumb as a conglomerate. The designation will force the company to adhere to a range of financial compliance rules. Per Jeongi Shinmun , Bithumb was one of just five companies added to the FTC’s list of conglomerate companies and business groups on May 1. Bithumb Conglomerate Status: What Does it Mean? The South Korean government has two separate conglomerate categories. The first is the “large conglomerate” category, which is subject to the strictest level of public disclosure regulations. The South Korean Fair Trade Commission at the Government Complex in Sejong, South Korea. (Source: Minseong Kim [CC BY-SA 4.0]) South Korean law requires “large conglomerates” to abide by more comprehensive financial disclosure requirements than regular firms. Companies with this designation must post regular reports on the status of their stock holdings. The designation also requires directors and their family members to comply with strict expropriation rules. South Korea’s top court ruled that presidential candidate Lee Jae-myung violated election law and sent the case back to the high court for final sentencing. https://t.co/3EhhchGsvu — Bloomberg (@business) May 1, 2025 And firms in a second “conglomerate” category must adhere to investment and cross-holding rules. The government created the rules to prevent powerful companies from buying significant quantities of shares in stock exchange-listed firms. The FTC had previously ruled that the Bithumb rival Upbit qualifies as a “large conglomerate .” In May 2022, the body named Upbit’s operator Dunamu the South Korean crypto sector’s first official “large conglomerate.” It upheld its ruling in 2023 and 2024, but this year moved the operator into the lower “conglomerate” category, along with Bithumb. Both designations place a range of restrictions on company activities. They prevent, for instance, companies from making equity investments or loan guarantees with their affiliates and subsidiaries. Only Five Companies Added to FTC’s List Bithumb was one of just five companies added to the “conglomerate” list this year. The FTC also named the weapons-maker LIG, the real estate player Daekwang, the food manufacturer Sajo, and the shipping firm EUKOR. Trading volumes on the Bithumb crypto exchange over the past 12 months. (Source: CoinGecko) Chaebol Scrutiny Continues South Korea’s Fair Trade Act contains several clauses pertaining to corporations. Most of these were created in response to the rise of chaebol business groups. Chaebol groups are typically large, family-run companies with a wide range of business operations. Examples include Samsung, LG, and CJ. Critics claim that these groups wield excessive power in the business and political space, giving little room for smaller firms to operate. The act prohibits larger domestic companies from providing unfair benefits to “special related parties.” Its investment-related clauses were originally designed to stop the phenomenon of “circular investment,” whereby company owners obfuscate their financial activities by investing in their own subsidiaries. The FTC explained that both Bithumb and Upbit were placed on the list because of a sharp rise in crypto trading in late 20224. The body wrote that at around the time of the US Presidential Election, the volume of customer deposits on domestic exchanges increased rapidly. The FTC’s rulings on crypto exchanges have attracted criticism from some detractors. The agency calculates the worth of firms’ total asset holdings when making its evaluations. Some claim that, as most exchanges hold more crypto than fiat, it is hard to ensure the accuracy of these calculations.

Senate Majority Leader John Thune, a South Dakota Republican, started the ball rolling to fast-track the Guiding and Establishing National Innovation for U.S. Stablecoins (GENIUS) Act , which is the Senate's version of two similar bills rolling through both chambers of Congress. The House of Representatives is expected to follow closely behind on its own voting. Thune's move to expedite the bill is meant to limit delays and floor action in order to get it done more quickly. It's so far unclear precisely when the Senate vote will happen, but an earlier vote on the effort in the Senate Banking Committee had approved it with a wide bipartisan majority of 18-6. The House Financial Services Committee also advanced its similar bill in April. “I look forward to passing the GENIUS Act in short order to keep digital asset innovation in America, protect customers, and make sure foreign companies are playing by the same rules,” said Senator Bill Hagerty, the Tennessee Republican who authored the bill, in a statement. It's also backed by Senator Tim Scott, the chairman of the Senate Banking Committee. President Donald Trump's self-described crypto sherpa, Bo Hines, the executive director of the Presidential Council of Advisers for Digital Assets, told CoinDesk earlier this week that the two bills are as much as 90% similar and that members of both chambers are seeking to work out the differences.

SOL price has regained 50-day SMA as a support level and now eyes $180 next. After closing the past three weeks in a bullish outlook, Solana (SOL) price has signaled the return of bullish sentiment. The large-cap altcoin, with a fully diluted valuation of about $90 billion and a 24-hour average trading volume of around $3.7 billion, gained over 20 percent in April 2025 to trade at about $150.33 on Thursday, during the late North American session. The rising bullish momentum for Solana is heavily bolstered by institutional investors and rising Futures Open Interest (OI) by over $1.6 billion in the past four weeks. Midterm Expectations for Solana Price In the weekly timeframe, Solana price has been consolidating in a megaphone structure for the past twelve months. Following a successful rebound from the lower border of the macro megaphone, SOL price has gradually gained bullish momentum. Moreover, the weekly MACD histograms have been signaling a growing bullish momentum after a prolonged bearish period. Additionally, the weekly MACD line is almost crossing the signal line, suggesting bullish sentiment. Meanwhile, the Bollinger Bands for Solana price, in the four-hour timeframe, have been squeezing, signaling a major price move in the near future. Fundamental Outlook The Solana network remains a premier ecosystem for DeFi developers, with a total value locked (TVL) of about $8 billion and a stablecoins market cap of around $13 billion. The Solana network has recorded significant growth in memecoins in the past year, thus achieving a 24-hour active addresses of over 3.6 million across its DeFi protocols. The anticipated approval of spot Solana ETFs before the end of 2025, will play a crucial role in SOL’s market outlook. Moreover, the rising adoption of Solana from institutional investors will help validate the network and increase its demand and liquidity in the long haul.",Price Analysis,EN,0,0,ALTCOIN|BUSINESS|MARKET|SOL|TRADING,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-05-01 23:34:31
44044411,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=719183,1746142525,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/44044411.jpeg,Security flaw in Cosmos SDK may allow DDoS attacks,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/security-flaw-in-cosmos-sdk-may-allow-ddos-attacks/,"Blockchain security firm Oak Security has raised concerns about a vulnerability in the Cosmos chain software development kit (SDK) that could lead to a Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attack on the network. In a Medium post, two of the firm’s researchers, Edward Kotysh and Christian Vari, explained why this is a major risk. According to the researchers , the vulnerability lies in the fact that the BeginBlock and EndBlock functions are not subject to gas metering. This is by design, as it enables developers to have some free computation time, as these two functions do not necessarily affect user transactions. However, the security experts warned that what was meant to be a minor leeway for developers could actually cause significant damage to Cosmos-based networks in several ways. These include causing network congestion, affecting validators, or even leading to a complete outage. They said: “This freedom can be a double-edged sword, and it can open up a Pandora’s box of potential vulnerabilities. The main issue is that without gas limits, poorly optimized or malicious code in BeginBlock and EndBlock can really wreak havoc.” The researchers tested their theories on the potential impact of the vulnerability by conducting experiments. In one of the experiments, they introduced randomized delays to the BeginBlock function at various block heights, with delays ranging from five seconds to one minute. From the experiments, the experts confirmed that the delays led to substantial congestion in the network, slowing its progression and increasing the time needed to complete blocks. It also affected validators, with several of them failing to sign blocks at the required times and some missing voting phases completely. Unsurprisingly, the limited number of validators available to sign transactions (less than two-thirds) meant that the test chain experienced temporary outages. The researchers noted that this could result in a complete outage on the mainnet itself, where there are several transactions happening at once that need to be finalized. Oak Security recommends fixes for developers Meanwhile, the security experts have recommended solutions to fix the vulnerability before a bad actor exploits it. According to them, there is a need to implement strict computation bounds so that even anyone cannot simply add any attack vector that will cause excessive computation. They identified three different ways of implementing this solution. These include adding time complexity to the BeginBlock and EndBlock functions so they do not run indefinitely, context wrapping to keep resource-intensive operations into metered contexts, and validation of all inputs to the function. Additionally, they called for more comprehensive testing and simulation to determine how the vulnerability could be exploited and the potential of its impact. They also identified architectural safeguards and operational monitoring to ensure the networks operate by standard metrics and detect any significant deviation. Cosmos SDK launches new version Meanwhile, the Cosmos SDK has yet to comment on the security report and whether it will do anything to address the issue on their end. This might be because the identified vulnerability is actually a design feature and not a bug or malware, like recent security alerts on supply chain attacks. Fortunately, developers using the Cosmos SDK can implement most of the recommendations from security experts, enabling them to take control of what they deploy and ensure it is not vulnerable to DDoS attacks. Interestingly, Cosmos SDK recently launched its version v0.53.0. According to the announcement on X, the version is a response to the pain points that builders raised about the previous version. The latest version reportedly comes with unordered transactions, improved capacities for community pools, custom governance mechanisms, epochs, and custom minting. It also comes with bug fixes, and developers can already upgrade to it on GitHub. Cosmos SDK is a tool for developers to easily build their own customized network and integrate with the Cosmos blockchain, a network seeking to become the Internet of Blockchains.

This dip, rather than signaling weakness, may in fact represent a healthy retracement as the cryptocurrency prepares for a new upward move. The price structure appears bullish on higher timeframes, especially after POL recently rebounded off the lower boundary of a long-term descending channel. According to a crypto analyst, Polygon could be on the verge of an explosive rally toward the $1 mark. Classic Bullish Divergence Points To Imminent Breakout According to technical analyst MasterAnanda on TradingView, the Polygon ecosystem token (POLUSDT) is currently flashing one of the strongest technical reversal signals in the form of a textbook bullish divergence on the 3-day chart. Price action hit a new low on April 7, 2025, but the Relative Strength Index (RSI) had already bottomed earlier in July 2024 and has since been forming higher lows. Related Reading: Polygon (MATIC) To Come back From The Dead As Ascending Triangle Appears As noted by the analyst, this mismatch between the price and the momentum indicator is a classic signal that the downtrend may be losing steam. The signal is reinforced by the recent increase in volume and the broader bullish recovery observed across the cryptocurrency market. Zooming in on the 3-day chart structure, POLUSDT experienced a notable rebound after reaching its low on April 7. The price climbed steadily to $0.267 by April 22 before encountering resistance. What followed were two successive bearish candlesticks that appeared to trace a measured pullback, likely a retest of the upper boundary of the descending channel. This movement is significant because retests of this nature often precede major breakouts. Keeping this in mind, the analyst predicted a successful bounce from the trendline support, which could start a sustained rally toward $1. Polygon To $1: Window Of Opportunity Narrowing Analyst MasterAnanda noted that the current price action is merely a calm before a massive move. “The market is giving us one last chance to buy all we want before massive growth,” the analyst said, implying that a strong impulsive wave could be next. The RSI is currently in the mid-40s, and if the bullish setup plays out, a swift move to the 70+ zone could occur. Related Reading: Polygon Price Risks Plunge With 90 Million MATIC Tokens Selling At $0.5 In terms of a price target, the analyst predicted a full recovery above $1 with a specific target of $1.15. This would mark a full recovery for POL holders who have been holding throughout the downturn in 2025. This level corresponds to the 1.618 level on the Fib extension projected from the April 7 low. The Fibonacci extension levels plotted on the chart show other smaller price targets on the way to $1.15. Most notable are the $0.461 and $0.534 regions, representing the 0.5 and 0.618 extension levels, respectively, which could serve as interim consolidation zones. At the time of writing, Polygon is trading at $0.2420.

Devin Nunes, the chief executive and chairman of the Trump Media & Technology Group (TMTG), says in a new shareholder letter that the firm is exploring a token and a “Truth digital wallet.” Nunes, a former member of Congress, says the token could be used to pay for Truth+ subscription costs and “later be applied to other products and services in the Truth ecosphere.” Trump’s controversial Solana ( SOL )-based memecoin, TRUMP , ticked down after the news. The 48th-ranked crypto asset by market cap is trading at $12.70 at time of writing and is down more than 7% in the past 24 hours. In January, TMTG announced a partnership with financial services giant Charles Schwab to launch Truth.Fi, a fintech firm with crypto services. As a means of diversifying the firm’s reserves, TMTG’s board has approved an investment of $250 million to be custodied by Charles Schwab, which could go toward investment vehicles, exchange-traded funds (ETFs), separately managed accounts (SMAs), as well as Bitcoin ( BTC ) and other digital assets. In the recent shareholder letter, Nunes says the first two Truth.Fi products will be slates of customized SMAs and ETFs. “Both products will have an America-First theme, focusing on a diverse set of companies across multiple industries, with the ETFs offering both cryptocurrencies and traditional equities. To launch our financial products, Trump Media partnered with top-quality companies that have great synergy with our business and vision. We’ve joined with Index Technologies Group and Yorkville America Equities to develop the SMAs, and with Crypto.com and Yorkville America Digital to develop the ETFs. Trump Media is planning to invest, alongside you, in these products via its own cash reserves.” Trump’s ventures in the crypto world have generated significant public criticism: Ethereum ( ETH ) founder Vitalik Buterin said earlier this year that political coins represented “vehicles for unlimited political bribery.” In a February letter to the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) and the Office of Government Ethics, officials at the nonprofit consumer advocacy organization Public Citizen argued that Trump’s memecoin could be in violation of federal law regulating gifts to government officials.

Unlike other L2 solutions, this project will not feature any token and depends solely on donations. The project’s devs even commented on the launch: “General-purpose L2s should be commodities — simple, replaceable, and free from centralized dependencies or risky governance. Ethereum R1 is our answer to that call. The roll-up grounded in credible neutrality, decentralization, and censorship resistance.” Ethereum’s transaction fees dropped to its lowest in five years in April ETH developers claimed that most current L2s work more similarly to new L1 projects than scaling solutions with private allocations, opaque governance, and centralized control. Lately, users have also raised concerns about how Ethereum L2 projects have drifted from the main interests of the base layer. The Ethereum R1 is a way to address all those issues, with the project team emphasizing that it will neither have venture funding nor any pre-mined token allocations or a governance token. The network had started to lay ground for new L2 projects much earlier. In March 2024, they released the Dencun upgrade, which reduced fees for its existing L2 scaling solutions. However, its base layer revenue had dwindled by nearly 100% by September of that year. Moreover, transaction fees on its base layer have continued to sink, reaching a five-year low of $0.16 per transaction in April 2025, primarily driven by reduced demand for block space. Some analysts have hinted that L2 growth incentives caused the base layer revenue declines, asking the network to reconsider its options. Ethereum’s dominance and demand is picking up In the past few months, the demand and relevance among new users for the ETH network have dropped. However, according to Growthepie, there was a 62% rise in active addresses week-on-week and another 57% surge in Layer 2 dominance. Recently, ETH had the highest market sentiment with 82%, while Solana and Bitcoin followed at only 3.6% and 2.7% respectively. In addition, Loookchain reported that crypto whales have been rushing to purchase ETH. In the last few hours, they acquired 5,362 ETH for over $7.2 million. One trader with the address ‘0xDdb4’ received a loan from Aave, about $3.44 million USDC from Aave, and purchased 1,856 ETH. Another whale, ‘0xf84d’, borrowed $1.64 million USDC, topped it up, and bought 1259 ETH with $2.34 million USDC. The other trader, ‘0x69D0’, took up 2,250 ETH worth around $4.12 million from the Binance crypto exchange. Ethereum flashes bottom signal as key metric hints at major rebound ahead Ethereum price was on a bullish path yesterday, May 1, after crossing above $1,850 for the first time in more than three weeks. The gains come amid chatter that ETH may have hit a local bottom, with key on-chain metrics supporting this hypothesis. ETH value today trades at $1,841 with a modest 2.56% gain in 24 hours. The uptrend coincides with a 60% spike in trading volumes as the market eagerly awaits whether a breakout above the psychological level of $2,000 will happen next. Ethereum has traded below the $2,000 level for most of the past two months. The price hit a low of below $1,400 on April 9. It had made something that amounted to a run to $1,550 and higher by April 22, though following a broad market lift on Bitcoin, it regained momentum. The ETH price, however, dipped again on April 30, falling to $1,736 within two hours. ETH price simply had more forced closures during this dip, topping $67 million compared to Bitcoin’s $64 million. Of the total $291 million, $48 million was on long positions, per Coinglass data . Such liquidations often lead to a rapid drop in price, ruining leveraged traders and short-term sentiment. Following this, Ethereum’s short-term chart has formed a head and shoulders pattern. This technical formation is usually connected to trend reversals and how traders will assess the upcoming price movement. Cryptopolitan Academy: Want to grow your money in 2025?

Kraken said in a May 1 report that its NinjaTrader acquisition would give its US customers access to the traditional derivatives market, aligning with its plans to expand its offerings and be the go-to platform for all types of trading. NinjaTrader is a registered Futures Commission Merchant with the Commodity Futures Trading Commission. Last month, it rolled out trading for over 11,000 stocks and exchange-traded funds to certain US clients. The deal, which Kraken dubbed the largest ever between a crypto and traditional finance firm, allows NinjaTrader to expand to the UK, continental Europe and Australian markets and comes as Kraken is preparing for an initial public offering in early 2026. The company is exploring a debt package worth between $200 million and $1 billion to facilitate that transaction. Kraken revenue, trading volume falls on Trump’s return Kraken’s $471.7 million revenue in Q1 marked a 19% increase from the year-ago quarter but a 6.8% fall from Q4 2024 . The exchange reported that trading volume fell 9.6% quarter-over-quarter to $208.7 billion while the value of its custodied assets fell 18% to $34.9 billion over the same time. Kraken attributed the drop to a “slowdown in overall market trading activity” as US President Donald Trump’s threats of implementing sweeping tariffs triggered an 18% fall in the crypto market cap over the quarter. Key metrics from Kraken’s Q1 report. Source: Kraken Kraken is one of several crypto platforms that saw record or near-record highs in trading activity in Q4 as Trump's November election win sparked larger-than-usual market volatility. Related: Kraken rolls out ETF and stock access for US crypto traders Kraken said that despite a “softening market,” its adjusted EBITDA — earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization — jumped 1% from the previous quarter to $187.4 million. The firm also saw the number of funded accounts on its platform increase 10% quarter-on-quarter to 3.9 million, signaling “deeper client engagement.” Reuters reported on April 18 that Kraken restructured its workforce after Arjun Sethi was appointed as co-CEO last October. Sethi has laid off around 400 employees since.

The regulatory challenges XRP faces diminish its potential as a top performer in 2025. Attention of traders now shifts toward Mutuum Finance (MUTM) since this DeFi project demonstrates fast growth beyond Ripple’s targets. The Mutuum Finance has gathered $7.3 million in funding since inception as it accumulated over 9,200 investors who have purchased tokens at $0.025 before the prospective 20% growth during the next phase. Investors who join today will receive a 140% return on investment by the time Mutuum Finance lists. MUTM gains potential for substantial upside potential while XRP stalls because investors are showing increased interest in the new asset. XRP Price Prediction: Will $5 to $7 be the Next Target for Ripple? Analysts predict XRP will experience a market-legendary price increase because it continues to expand despite regulatory hurdles towards reaching $5 value during the fourth quarter of 2025. XRP demonstrates promise through increasing institutional interest together with recent legal triumphs that will enable worldwide acceptance in financial services and technological markets. The worldwide status XRP establishes as a cross-border payments authority will help it soar to even greater elevation in its upcoming market cycle. The strong growth path of XRP meets competition from Mutuum Finance (MUTM) which shows rising popularity for its future market potential in 2025. Mutuum Finance Presale Gaining Momentum Currently at Phase 4, Mutuum Finance tokens are priced at $0.025. As the presale reaches Phase 5, the token price will rise to $0.03, giving early investors a built-in advantage. To further increase interaction, Mutuum Finance has recently launched a live leaderboard, highlighting the top 50 token holders. Those who are able to rank high will receive bonus tokens, adding a competitive, rewarding factor for early adopters. Mutuum Finance is innovative by combining the optimal elements of Peer-to-Contract (P2C) and Peer-to-Peer (P2P) lending models. In the P2C model, users lend stablecoins like USDT to smart contract-based liquidity pools and earn passive income while facilitating fast and secure borrowing. Conversely, in the P2P model, lenders and borrowers are directly connected, and therefore full confidentiality and greater control over terms are provided without employing any intermediary. This hybrid solution provides an equilibrium approach to decentralization, security, and efficiency and thus will attract both conservative investors who desire stable returns and those who seek greater freedom and flexibility. Designed for Stability and Security Stability together with security are central design objectives of Mutuum Finance since its foundation. The project delivers complete collateralization of its stablecoin by making it backed by the USD without algorithmic instabilities while ongoing smart contract audits and financial transparency commitments strengthen user trust and business sustainability. Mutuum Finance seeks community expansion through its $100,000 giveaway that gives each of ten winners $10,000 worth of MUTM tokens in addition to its referral program which rewards members who spread the network. Ripple (XRP) is primed for a breakout as it rides the momentum of increasing institutional adoption and a series of favorable court rulings, potentially reaching $5 to $7 by Q4 2025. As XRP surges, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is also emerging as a significant player in the DeFi space, offering early investors a rare opportunity with prices set to rise 20% in Phase 5. The combination of Ripple’s institutional push and Mutuum Finance’s innovative approach to decentralized lending makes these two assets worth watching closely in 2025.

Since then, the token has surged over 115%, marking a sharp and aggressive short-term uptrend. This rally reflects a growing appetite for risk among traders and renewed confidence across the broader crypto market. As major assets like Bitcoin and Ethereum consolidate near key resistance levels, smaller-cap tokens such as HYPE are gaining traction—benefiting from the increased momentum and speculative interest. Related Reading: Whales Sell 262,000 Ethereum Amid Recent Price Surge – Smart Exit Or Profit-Taking? Bulls are firmly in control, driving HYPE to test and reclaim critical technical levels. Top analyst Big Cheds shared a technical analysis on X, highlighting that HYPE is showing a strong response after retesting a key liquidity level. This price action, according to Cheds, may signal the beginning of a more sustained upward movement, especially if HYPE maintains its current structure and volume trends. With on-chain activity rising and market sentiment improving, all eyes are now on HYPE to see whether it can continue outperforming its peers. If bulls maintain momentum and reclaim higher resistance levels, HYPE could extend its rally and become one of the standout altcoin performers of the quarter. HYPE Eyes Breakout As Bulls Defend Key Levels HYPE continues to establish itself as one of the leading DeFi projects in the current market cycle, acting as a major decentralized exchange (DEX) with growing user activity and liquidity. After a strong run-up over the past few weeks, the token is now approaching a critical juncture as bulls attempt to reclaim the range highs and push through the psychological $20 resistance level. Despite recent bullish momentum, global macroeconomic uncertainty and rising geopolitical tensions are keeping the crypto market volatile, especially for altcoins. In this context, HYPE’s price action stands out. After a sharp move upward, the token faced a brief pullback, but according to Big Cheds, the response to this “throwback” was notably strong. The bounce from the $17 zone shows clear support, reinforcing buyer interest at these levels. Ched’s analysis suggests that this healthy retest of a previous liquidity pocket could fuel the next leg up. If bulls maintain control, HYPE could break through $20 and test the next significant supply zone above it. However, a short period of consolidation may be necessary to build enough momentum for the breakout. Related Reading: Solana Monthly Candle Reclaims Key Levels – Is $240 The Next Target? With fundamentals backing its growth and technicals flashing strength, HYPE is positioned as one of the key DeFi tokens to watch. A confirmed move above $20 could open the door to price discovery and cement HYPE’s leadership role among decentralized exchanges. Price Action Details: Holding A Bullish Structure HYPE is currently trading above $19 after a decisive move that pushed it beyond key short-term resistance. The token has shown strong momentum over the past two weeks, supported by growing market confidence and rising volume across decentralized finance platforms. Bulls are clearly in control, but the next major hurdle lies at the $22 level. Reclaiming $22 is critical for confirming a breakout and continuing the rally toward new all-time highs. This zone represents both psychological resistance and a historical supply region where sellers previously took profits. A clean push above $22 would likely trigger fresh buying and shift HYPE into price discovery mode. However, risks remain if momentum fades or broader market conditions weaken. The $17 level is now a key support zone to watch. If bulls lose control and price drops below that mark, HYPE could retrace further into lower demand zones, likely targeting the $14–$15 region. Related Reading: Ethereum Consolidates Against Bitcoin – Dominance Shift On The Horizon? For now, as long as HYPE holds above $19 and builds momentum, the bullish structure remains intact. The coming sessions will be crucial to determine whether the token has enough strength to clear $22 and continue leading the DeFi sector’s recovery.

Arbitrum, one of Ethereum’s leading layer 2 networks, has been actively distributing ARB tokens to support the development of its ecosystem. Its DAO has reportedly rolled out several hundred million dollars in grants, service provider funding, and incentives; however, according to Entropy Advisors, there has been little oversight on how these funds are actually spent. Interestingly, recent investigations have uncovered at least three separate incidents of grant misappropriation. One of them was the Furucombo case . The Arbitrum foundation accused Furucombo of misusing the backfund STIP grant after it failed to file a final report on how it spent the grant. Along with other transgressions, the Arbitrum DAO banned Furocombo from the DAO after extensive voting. Another case is the Gaming Catalyst Program (GCP), which received 225 million ARB worth approximately $215 million in early 2024. The GCP team is embroiled in allegations of misappropriation, underreporting and lack of transparency in its grant issuance, with a proposal launched to claw back funding. Recognizing the potential for further undiscovered abuses, Entropy Advisors proposed a system to enable the community to report misuse with the incentive of significant monetary rewards. The grant misuse bounty initiative proposed by Entropy Advisors has been tagged “The Watchdog.” In its proposal, Entropy Advisors defined the misuse of funds as “Any action or inaction by a recipient of DAO-allocated funds that directly violates the stated terms, objectives, agreement, or overall spirit of the allocation under which those funds were provided.” How the Watchdog program works The Watchdog program, which is proposed to operate like the more common bug bounty program, encourages community members to report inappropriate use of DAO funds privately through GlobaLeaks, the open-source whistleblowing platform used by governments, NGOs, and investigative journalists. As stated in the proposal, all submissions are private and secure, and whistleblowers can earn between $5,000 and $100,000 per confirmed report, with payouts determined by the severity of the violation and the quality of evidence provided. The process begins with a confidential submission of findings to a review committee, composed of members from Entropy Advisors, Arbitrum Foundation, and SeedGov. The committee of reviewers then go on to test the validity of the submission and also determine the severity of the misuse of funds. The severity, which ranges from low to high, in turn determines the amount that will be paid out to the whistleblower. For low severity submissions, whistleblowers can get a base payout of 1,000 ARB, which is deducted from the recovered funds if applicable, with the total possible reward being capped at $10,000. For cases with medium severity, the proposed bounty is a base payout of 10,000 ARB, and the maximum reward yield in the category is $25,000. Finally, for cases that rank high in order of severity, the bounty prize is a base payout of 30,000 ARB, while the maximum payout here is capped at $100,000. Cases like that of Furocombo fall under the medium category due to severity, as it involved the misuse of DAO-allocated funds that impacted the DAO’s resources. Proposed timelines for implementation The proposed launch date for the Watchdog bounty program is the end of May, with the Entropy Advisors proposal being subject to on-chain voting from May 8 to May 22. The results of the voting will greatly impact the program‘s launch date. Entropy Advisors also propose that an initial 400,000 ARB tokens be allocated to fund the program. According to them, the implementation of this program will not only deter malicious actions and actors, but it will also attract sophisticated on-chain sleuths and investigators to Arbitrum.

The company says its decision is less about TRUMP or cryptocurrency and more about the upcoming U.S.-Mexico tariffs that threaten business needs. TRUMP meme coin faces scrutiny over potential misuse of president’s crypto wealth The TRUMP meme coin has been controversial since its launch. Much of the President’s cash is wrapped up in crypto. An influential group of experts and former regulators have said the coin raises concerns about potential misuse. Freight Technologies announcing they plan to spend $20 million on constructing TRUMP Treasury has only added to that concern. The company’s press release provides insight into the investment’s reasoning. While it briefly touches on Freight’s interest in AI and Web3 technologies, the main focus is on how U.S.-Mexico trade tariffs might affect the company: “At the heart of our mission is the promotion of productive and active commerce between the United States and Mexico. Mexico is the United States’ top goods trading partner. We believe that adding Official TRUMP tokens is an effective way to advocate for fair, balanced, and free trade between Mexico and the U.S.,” said CEO Javier Selgas. Freight Technologies’ investment sparks speculation over U.S.-Mexico tariffs and stock slide Freight Technologies plays a key role in cross-border shipping with Mexico and is using AI to optimize trade between the two nations. The company sees the potential for a trade war with Mexico to disrupt its operations severely. Although President Trump has previously granted tariff exemptions to certain businesses, the company’s statement does not specifically appeal to him for such a carve-out. Reports suggest that some crypto companies received indirect legal benefits after donating to Trump’s inauguration fund, with some donations as small as $100,000. So, could Freight’s $20 million investment make an impression? While it’s hard to make definitive claims, the company’s actions surrounding the TRUMP deal raise eyebrows—the majority of its reasoning for the purchase centers on U.S.-Mexico trade relations. The press release briefly mentions that the TRUMP tokens could help diversify the company’s crypto holdings, but this is the only mention unrelated to tariffs. Suppose Freight Technologies is indeed attempting to influence the President. In that case, it seems likely that the company would prefer the Mexico tariffs to be removed entirely, not just seek an exemption for itself. At any rate, this TRUMP buy could prove to be bad news for Freight’s stock. The press release was first written on the 30th of April but attracted much attention in the crypto circles on the 1st of May. As the headlines spread, the company’s stock plunged more than 20%. This is one to watch closely. More companies are creating Strategy-style plans around cryptocurrencies. Freight Technologies may be among the first, but they likely won’t be the last. Trump’s meme coin surges 58% after exclusive dinner invitation to top holders President Trump’s meme coin, which had dropped 88% from its recent peak, experienced a surge last Wednesday after the coin’s website invited the top 220 holders of the digital token to an “intimate private dinner” with the president. Following the dinner invitation posted on the $TRUMP meme coin website and Twitter account, the coin’s value spiked by $5.32, or 58%, reaching $14.32 by Wednesday afternoon. This increase, however, only partially offset the coin’s significant drop from its high of $75.35 on January 19, the day before Trump’s inauguration. The dinner invitation promises $TRUMP coin investors the chance to “Hear close-up, from President Trump, about the future of Crypto!” Trump, who has expressed plans to make the U.S. the global cryptocurrency hub, has also launched several digital ventures, including NFTs branded as “Trump digital trading cards” and a cryptocurrency platform called World Liberty Financial. According to the Trump coin website, CIC Digital LLC, an affiliate of The Trump Organization, and Fight Fight Fight LLC together hold 80% of the meme coin supply. Fight Fight Fight is a Delaware-based LLC, as reported by the Wall Street Journal. Cryptopolitan Academy: Tired of market swings? Learn how DeFi can help you build steady passive income.

This is the question defining early 2025. Bitcoin holds the $100K zone with RSI strength and rising institutional inflows. On one end, Bitcoin is surging again, with strong accumulation zones and bullish structures attracting institutional momentum. On the other hand, some are looking beyond charts—into projects that solve real problems, not just dominate newsfeeds. This is where Qubetics ($TICS) rises above the noise. While legacy networks struggle with scaling issues or a narrow focus, Qubetics is building real tools for real-world use. From cross-border automation to decentralized development infrastructure, it’s not chasing a trend—it’s engineering the backbone for tomorrow’s digital economy. And judging by the numbers, the community is taking notice. Bitcoin Stalls Near $95K — Is the Next Bitcoin Price Prediction Calling for $138K? Bitcoin entered Q2 2025 with renewed strength, trading just above $109,000 after breaking out of its March consolidation zone with a sharp 12% gain. Analysts now view the $115,000 to $118,500 region as the next central resistance zone, with key Fibonacci levels projecting breakout targets at $124,300 and $138,000. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) remains near 61, well within healthy territory, indicating that Bitcoin still has room to run before reaching exhaustion. Beyond charts and indicators, Bitcoin’s structural appeal has been reignited by strong macro signals. ETF inflows are rising sharply, supported by newly proposed reserve policies in multiple economic blocs. The supply of BTC on exchanges has dropped to its lowest point in over three years, creating a liquidity crunch just as demand accelerates. This tightening supply dynamic is reinforcing the bullish thesis, particularly among large funds seeking long-term hedges in a volatile global economy. Cycle-based models are now forecasting a potential peak above $150,000 by Q4 2025, echoing the historic blow-off top pattern observed after previous halvings. On the technical front, Bitcoin is trading within a bullish flag formation on the weekly chart, with its lower support at $101,200 and a resistance trendline that is climbing toward $133,000. If current macroeconomic conditions persist, particularly with global de-dollarization trends and increasing rate volatility, Bitcoin’s narrative as a non-sovereign store of value is likely to fuel continued accumulation. Traders and analysts alike are treating this cycle not as speculative noise but as a strategic build-up toward a long-awaited parabolic leg. In short, Bitcoin’s price prediction narrative is no longer just about volatility—it’s about validation. Market Impact: Bitcoin’s Strength Validates the Entire Crypto Asset Class Bitcoin (BTC) is trading at approximately $95,177, representing a modest 0.42% increase over the past 24 hours. Bitcoin’s current structure—trading within a bullish flag and witnessing a sharp drop in exchange-held supply—signals far more than just price movement. It reflects a fundamental shift in how institutional capital is treating Bitcoin: not as a speculative asset, but as a strategic, non-sovereign store of value. As ETF inflows continue to grow and reserve frameworks around Bitcoin emerge across multiple economic regions, BTC is increasingly being viewed as a foundational asset for macro portfolios. This structural confidence is not only reinforcing Bitcoin’s dominance—it’s validating the entire crypto asset class. Bitcoin’s liquidity profile, combined with its proven monetary policy and historical track record, positions it as the benchmark against which all other digital assets are measured. Its price movement no longer represents short-term market sentiment; it sets the tone for regulatory clarity, sovereign adoption, and global financial evolution. In 2025, Bitcoin is no longer fighting for legitimacy. It has it. And in doing so, it anchors the credibility of decentralized finance at large, sending a clear signal to capital markets that blockchain is no longer a fringe experiment—it’s becoming economic infrastructure. Qubetics: Solving Real Problems with Real Tools Qubetics is a Layer 1 blockchain designed not just to compete, but to simplify and scale what previous blockchains couldn’t. At the center of its utility engine is QubeQode, a low-code tool that lets users deploy smart contracts and decentralized applications without deep programming expertise. Unlike platforms that demand months of Solidity training, QubeQode offers drag-and-drop modules and visual scripting, helping businesses and professionals build systems like tokenized payroll, supply chain tracking, or royalty-based digital publishing in a fraction of the time. Backing this tool is the Qubetics IDE, an integrated development environment built to empower blockchain developers with faster workflows, real-time error detection, and native deployment across multiple chains. Whether it’s building a finance app or automating digital identity management, the Qubetics IDE turns technical complexity into operational clarity. The platform’s traction speaks volumes. Qubetics is in its 32nd presale stage. The token price stands at $0.2093. Over 510 million $TICS tokens have already been sold, drawing participation from more than 25,500 holders. The presale tally has now crossed $16.5 million, a clear indicator of strong confidence and growing market attention. This isn’t just another speculative cycle—it’s functional infrastructure in motion. If the token hits $1, it brings a 378% return. At $5, that rises to 2,289%. A post-mainnet value of $15 would mark a staggering 7,066% ROI. These aren’t just theoretical multipliers; they’re the result of product-driven traction and real-world use. What Experts Are Saying About Qubetics: Can $2,000 Morph Into $143K by Mainnet? It’s not just hype—it’s math backed by momentum. With Qubetics ($TICS) sitting at $0.2093 in its 32nd presale stage, a $2,000 entry bags roughly 9,555 tokens. If $TICS hits just $1 after the presale, that stack turns into $9,555—already a 378% gain. Push that to $5, and it rockets to $47,775. But it doesn’t stop there. If Qubetics climbs to $10, you’re looking at $95,550. And if the project reaches $15 post-mainnet, that same $2,000 could explode into $143,325. Conclusion: Two Giants, Two Paths—Same Destination? Bitcoin and Qubetics operate on different frequencies. One is the standard-bearer, built on scarcity and trust. The other is a rising infrastructure project focused on usability and technological empowerment. But in 2025, both are showing why they matter. Bitcoin commands attention through strength, legacy, and tightening supply dynamics. The price action aligns with institutional adoption, and its evolving regulatory clarity adds fire to the Bitcoin price prediction narrative. Meanwhile, Qubetics doesn’t just promise—it delivers. With QubeQode and its full-stack IDE, it lowers the barrier to blockchain creation, expands use cases, and secures massive ROI potential through real-world engagement. For community members looking to be part of meaningful innovation, not just watch it, Qubetics offers an entry point backed by more than hype. For those seeking foundational digital assets with liquidity and legacy, Bitcoin continues to prove it still sets the tone. Both offer unique strengths—but only one still gives early access. The Qubetics crypto presale isn’t open forever. Bitcoin isn’t staying cheap forever. Timing, as always, decides the outcome.

Kraken said the applicant’s red flags appeared early on in the process when they joined an interview under a name different from what they applied with and “occasionally switched between voices,” apparently being guided through the interview. Rather than immediately rejecting the applicant, Kraken decided to advance them through its hiring process to gather information about the tactics used. International sanctions have effectively cut North Korea off from the rest of the world, and the country’s ruling Kim family dictatorship has long targeted crypto companies and users to top up the country’s coffers. It’s stolen billions worth of crypto so far this year. Kraken reported that industry partners had tipped them off that North Korean actors were actively applying for jobs at crypto companies. “We received a list of email addresses linked to the hacker group, and one of them matched the email the candidate used to apply to Kraken,” it said. With this information, the firm’s security team uncovered a network of fake identities used by the hacker to apply to multiple companies. Kraken also noted technical inconsistencies, which included the use of remote Mac desktops through VPNs and altered identification documents.

North Korean-linked hackers also stole more than $650 million through multiple crypto heists during 2024, while deploying IT workers to infiltrate blockchain and crypto companies as insider threats, according to a statement released by the US, Japan and South Korea in January. In April, a subgroup of Lazarus was found to have set up three shell companies , with two in the US, to deliver malware to unsuspecting users and scam crypto developers.

The meme coin failed to break a significant resistance level that contains a huge chunk of all SHIB coins in circulation, as per market information. Related Reading: Only XRP?

Almost 40% of those who own the dog-themed cryptocurrency are in profit at present. A breakout above $0.000014 would reverse this figure, leaving the majority of SHIB owners in profitable positions for the first time in weeks. Price Stuck In Narrow Trading Range The meme coin now trades within a tight 24-hour price range of $0.0000130 to $0.00001374, according to recent charts from IntoTheBlock. While prices are consolidating, some large investors seem to be adding more. The Chaikin Money Flow (CMF) indicator has once again turned positive, indicating renewed buying by deep-pocketed traders. Although it has risen more than 10% this month, technical indicators are sending mixed signals. The Stochastic Relative Strength Index is between 11 and 9, indicating SHIB may be trading below what experts view as its fair market value. This is even as trading volumes have fallen in recent days. Massive One-Day Token Burn Raises Eyebrows Meanwhile, more than 280 million SHIB tokens were irreversibly taken out of circulation in one day. Based on tracking platform Shibburn, this is a 38,299% rise in the burn rate – an unprecedented increase that surprised many market observers. Source: Shibburn Related Reading: Code Wars: Cardano Claims The Crown From Ethereum In Core Development This drastic burn lowers the circulating supply to around 584 trillion tokens. The SHIB community has long advocated for token burning as a means of inducing scarcity, which in theory would drive up the value of existing coins by lowering supply. The recent burn is a stark reversal following weeks of declining token removal rates. This is seen by some as a sign of renewed confidence among “whales,” or large investors, as well as smaller token holders, but others caution that burn rates alone do not necessarily indicate price ascent. Market participants are now closely monitoring if the synergy of technicals, increasing whale appetite, and token burning aggression will be enough for SHIB to break its strong resistance levels. With general market sentiment picking up in cryptocurrencies, the next couple of weeks could be crucial for the direction of the price of the popular meme token.

The proposal, posted on May 1 to Sky’s decentralized autonomous organization ( DAO ) forum, would see the Sky (SKY) token take over the Maker (MKR) token as the protocol’s governance token. If the DAO accepts, the change would be slated to take place around May 15 to May 19 and downgrading from SKY to MKR would also be disabled. Sky co-founder Rune Christensen said in response to the proposal that it was a “huge milestone,” which he “fully supports,” and laments that allowing users to downgrade from SKY back to MKR has been a “key limiting factor preventing exchanges from adopting SKY.” “With this change, exchanges are likely to move faster in quickly adopting SKY without concerns about fracturing liquidity,” he said. Source: Sky Penalties on MKR holders who are slow in switching to SKY have also been proposed. According to the proposal, a 1% delayed upgrade penalty would apply to all MKR to SKY upgrades starting Sept. 18, increasing every three months. Users hit with a delayed upgrade penalty will also obtain fewer SKY tokens. Sky staking, temporary pause on liquidations Christensen said the most important change would be to see SKY staking enabled as part of the changes to the protocol. Rewards for its decentralized stablecoin , USDS, which are based on the income the Sky Protocol generates, will be enabled two or three weeks after the upgrade of the governance contract, with a splitter rate of 50%, according to Christensen. Source: Rune Christensen “Getting past the full upgrade of MKR to SKY is one of the last pieces missing before Sky can transition to 0 fixed costs at the end of 2025, which will ensure an even greater portion of the income the protocol generates goes to the benefit of SKY buybacks, or SKY Staking Rewards,” he said. SKY liquidations will also be temporarily disabled while the one-way MKR to SKY transition is still in its early stages. Related: Sky doubles down on token overhaul: Making MKR unusable, launching subDAOs “This is necessary to prevent risk from price manipulation to the SKY and MKR price while the transition is happening,” Christensen said. “When SKY market liquidity is restored, Sky Governance will lift the liquidation freeze and move risk parameters to long-term targets,” he added. Maker rebranded to Sky in August last year but after confusion and negative feedback, Christensen considered going back to the original Maker name just months later. However, a November poll saw 79% of tokenholders vote to keep the Sky brand as the back end protocol brand with no further changes.

Market analysts are watching closely, as recent movements have opened up the possibility of further gains. Looking at the 4-day chart, an analyst has said that there are two main possible scenarios for XRP’s price direction: 1. The Yellow Scenario (More Likely) This scenario shows XRP continuing to rise, possibly reaching a new all-time high before undergoing a major correction. This structure follows a pattern of five waves that started from XRP’s low in 2013. If this plays out, a correction could follow, possibly pulling the price down to $0.40–$0.50, similar to past market behavior. 2. The White Scenario (Alternative) This scenario shows that the current bull market actually started in 2020, not 2013. XRP is possibly in the final wave of a smaller five-wave move. If true, a smaller but still significant correction could follow, possibly lasting up to a year. Despite the uncertainty, both scenarios expect another price increase, especially while XRP holds above the key support level of $1.20. If this happens, XRP could rise to $5.60 or even $6.60. Short-Term Outlook From a shorter-term perspective, XRP appears to be forming a five-wave move up from its April low. However, the pattern is not yet clear. If XRP stays above $2.12, prices could continue to rise. But if it drops below that level, we may see a correction with support between $1.84 and $2.10.",News|Altcoins|Crypto news|Price Analysis|Ripple (XRP),EN,0,0,ALTCOIN|MARKET|TRADING|XRP,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-05-02 03:01:35

April's on-chain data shows a decline in Bitcoin's Monthly Active Addresses, indicating a dwindling user base, partly due to ETF adoption. Bitcoin mining sector faces profitability challenges despite high BTC prices, with global hash rate growth and low fees impacting long-term security and decentralization. Gold has outperformed Bitcoin since 2021, but recent demand flow data suggests a potential capital rotation favoring Bitcoin in the short to medium term. My early-February call for 'beast mode ' in Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) and by extension the Fidelity Wise Origin Bitcoin Fund ETF ( FBTC ) was not well-timed. This was acknowledged later when I followed that piece up with a late-February article titled ""Turns Out, Bitcoin's Beast Was a Bear."" More recently, 'investor demand' for BTC has improved if ETF inflows are any indication. In this update, we'll look at April network data, the mining sector, and what (if any) relationship there is between Bitcoin and Gold ( XAUUSD:CUR ) that could foreshadow a larger capital rotation. On-Chain Data: April 2025 The on-chain metrics that I typically pay attention to when drawing my own assessment of Bitcoin's 'network health' are things like fees, daily active addresses, and transferred value. In April, Monthly Active Addresses came in at 10.9 million. This was flat month over month and down 14% year over year. Bitcoin DAAs vs MAAs (Token Terminal) The Token Terminal chart above shows Bitcoin user data expressed through both Daily Active Addresses (or DAAs) and Monthly Active Addresses (or MAAs). Though the trends are very similar, the MAA trend (green line) shows a peak in monthly active addresses in January 2021. Daily Active Addresses actually peaked in September 2023. The point is, we could easily argue Bitcoin is exhibiting a dwindling user base, since monthly unique addresses have been trending down through this halving cycle. Admittedly, some of this is due to 'adoption' taking place through ETFs rather than on-chain. We'll get into the ETF data in a later section. USD Transferred Value (CoinMetrics) At $9.9 billion in 30-day average transferred value, Bitcoin is still a highly functioning blockchain. However, the payment to miners for validating that transferred value continues to be underwhelming to say the least: Monthly Mining Fees (Token Terminal) At $15.7 million in fees for the month, April saw a 4% increase over March and a whopping 94% decline in full-month fees year over year. To be fair, April 2024 was the third-best month ever for Bitcoin miners from a fee-generation standpoint. But I can't stress enough that the lack of fees is a long-term problem for Bitcoin due to the limited supply of coins. Mining Industry Health It's easy to hand-wave away the importance of fees long term due to the fact that Bitcoin has always produced a new all-time high price following a halving event. In theory, the perpetual increase in the price of BTC offsets the reduction of fresh supply from block reward emissions. In reality, Bitcoin's price increase in this halving cycle arguably hasn't been enough to justify the global hashrate growth that we've seen since the halving in April 2024: Rewards USD vs BTC (mempool.space) The chart above shows Bitcoin mining rewards measured in both BTC (in yellow) and US dollars (in green). Yellow gets cut in half every four years. That matters less than the dollar-denominated rewards for miners, since mining expenses are denominated in fiat rather than BTC. A year after the halving in 2020, Bitcoin's dollar-denominated rewards were essentially at all-time highs. A year following the 2024 halving, Bitcoin's dollar denominated rewards are actually below that 2021 high. This wouldn't be as big of an issue for miners if the global hash rate was holding steady or even going down. The opposite is true: Data by YCharts Though it is admittedly off recent highs, Bitcoin's global hash rate has grown by 40% over the last twelve months. The result of which is a mining sector profitability figure that remains significantly depressed at just $49 per PHS/Day: Bitcoin Hashprice, 5 Year Trend (Hashrate Index) If you're looking for a reason why Bitcoin mining stocks are still well below their highs from the last cycle even with Bitcoin at $87k per coin, the chart above is a big part of your answer. To be sure, there are long-term implications to Bitcoin's security if mining can't be done profitability, and I'd wager one of those implications is the centralization of global hash. Consider that public mining companies can and have generally funded expansion through shareholder dilution rather than by efficiently running an operation. Smaller/private mining companies don't necessarily have that luxury. Unlike Gold, which does not require miners to exist for the movement/settlement of previously mined metal, Bitcoin's decentralized ledger does require validation from miners to create new blocks. This is one of the critical reasons why I don't think Bitcoin will overtake Gold in terms of market capitalization in my lifetime. But that doesn't mean the current setup can't favor Bitcoin for a capital rotation trade shorter to medium term. Rotation Trade Setup Gold has absolutely proven its value as a safe haven asset over the last three years. From the 2022 low to the 2025 high, Gold has more than doubled in price. For an asset with a multi-trillion market capitalization, this type of move in price is quite impressive. Gold has done so well since 2022, that we currently have a Bitcoin/Gold ratio that is below the 2021 peak of 36: Bitcoin/Gold Ratio (LongTermTrends.net) To be sure, this ratio did indeed make a new high of 40 in late 2024. But at the current 28 reading in the ratio, Gold has actually outperformed Bitcoin since November 2021. Even though Bitcoin has often been dubbed 'digital Gold,' the 30-day average correlation between the two had actually been negative for two straight months earlier this year. 30 Day Pearson (The Block) That has since reversed, and we currently find BTC and Gold with their tightest 30-day average correlation in 3 months. This comes with Gold beginning to show signs of temporary bull exhaustion and Bitcoin breaking out over technical resistance in late-April.

Once driven purely by internet culture and speculation, it now represents a complex trading environment with increasing institutional presence, data-driven strategies and measurable risk factors. In this market, individual traders often face diminishing returns. Narratives move faster than most can react to, and access to real-time data is now a minimum requirement. In 2025, successful participation in memecoin cycles requires not only infrastructure but also a clear framework for evaluating assets before engaging with them. The following metrics represent a baseline for assessing viability in today’s memecoin landscape. Whale and smart money wallet tracking – T he foundation of signal-based trading Large wallets – commonly referred to as whales – continue to serve as early indicators of sentiment shifts in the memecoin market. However, simply replicating their trades without looking at smart money trades has proven ineffective. Instead, data should be used to identify patterns of behavior. Wallets with a verifiable profit history over the past 30 days, ideally showing a 30–100% return on capital, tend to offer more reliable signals. Greater significance is typically assigned to those whose average trade size exceeds $5,000, suggesting a higher level of conviction. Tools that provide real-time monitoring of wallet activity can offer valuable context and alerts. Tokens that attract multiple large transactions – $30,000 and above – from such wallets within a short timeframe are more likely to reflect emerging trends, whereas isolated transactions may not be meaningful. This type of monitoring often provides a more accurate picture of market sentiment than technical indicators alone. Social attention – Without visibility, there’s limited traction For memecoins to gain traction, visibility remains a core requirement. A verified and active X account has become a minimum benchmark for credibility. While follower count is less important than engagement metrics, a baseline of consistent activity and community response indicates a functioning marketing effort – a n essential element in memecoin dynamics. Also, tracking the volume and velocity of social media mentions remains one of the most effective tools for early signal detection. Rather than focusing on absolute numbers, traders monitor acceleration – how quickly a token gains traction across platforms such as X, Telegram and Reddit. An emerging metric, velocity score, measures the rate of increase in mentions over short timeframes of approximately three-hour windows. Tokens showing sharp upward trends in social engagement often experience price movement shortly thereafter. Liquidity – C ritical to mitigating price manipulation Liquidity acts as a buffer against volatility. Low-liquidity coins may offer sharp upside during peak momentum but carry significantly higher downside risk. In 2025, experienced traders tend to avoid tokens with total liquidity below $150,000 unless paired with unusually high short-term volume and whale activity. As a general rule – $500,000 to $2 million liquidity represents a stable range for entry in mid-cap cycles. Pools above $5 million are less likely to deliver sharp price appreciation but provide higher security against slippage and coordinated manipulation. Token supply and holder distribution – A ssessing structural risk Tokens without clear developer burn mechanisms are increasingly viewed as unsustainable. If the founding team retains a significant portion of the supply and no verifiable burn events have occurred post-launch, long-term investor confidence is unlikely. Equally important is wallet concentration. In practice, a top 10 wallet group holding more than 20% of the total supply is viewed as a structural weakness. A more distributed supply generally correlates with reduced volatility and greater resilience to coordinated exits. Trading volume – A proxy for health and sustainability Consistent trading volume is essential for risk mitigation. In today’s environment, memecoins trading below $250,000 daily for more than 48 hours are generally considered inactive or abandoned. Conversely, volumes above $2 million indicate active cycles and more reliable liquidity across exchanges. And rising prices without matching volume tend to signal short-term exit activity rather than genuine interest. Understanding the game – T rading reflexivity, not fundamentals Unlike traditional assets, memecoins derive much of their value from reflexivity – the cycle of belief and price movement. That said, traders are buying tokens not for their intrinsic value but for the likelihood that others will buy after them. Success in this market depends on recognizing behavioral patterns, identifying when others will act and entering before broader momentum builds. Attempting this solo is increasingly ineffective. In 2025, the most competitive edge comes from collaboration – small trading groups with defined roles (on-chain analysis, social metrics, liquidity tracking, etc.) – outperform isolated participants consistently. Ultimately, memecoin trading has evolved into a highly specialized activity, demanding structured analysis, real-time infrastructure and shared insights. For those unwilling or unable to approach it at this level, passive exposure may be the more rational path.

At the moment, Bitcoin is trading just under $97,000. It recently broke through the $96,000 level and is showing signs of strength on the daily and weekly charts. Some price pullbacks are still expected, but the overall trend remains upward. Analysts are now watching closely for the next major price levels as this rally could drive the entire crypto market higher. In the second quarter of 2025, Bitcoin is showing strong bullish indicators. It recently cleared its 200-day moving average and is building strong support. Additional support levels at $95,797 and $96,441 are also being monitored as part of a broader bullish structure. According to an analyst, a sustained drop below $95,280 could signal the early stages of a larger correction, but as of now, Bitcoin remains firmly above that threshold. If buying pressure resumes, short-term targets to the upside include $97,325, $98,745, and the psychological milestone of $100,000. These levels represent areas of potential resistance based on recent price dynamics. The larger trend remains constructive, with bulls aiming for a continuation of the uptrend toward the $115,000–$120,000 range later this cycle—provided current support zones hold. Market Outlook: More Gains Ahead? The strong Bitcoin rally could push other cryptocurrencies like Ethereum, XRP, and Solana higher as well. This pattern, seen in past bull markets, usually starts with Bitcoin leading the way, followed by altcoins gaining momentum as investor money spreads across the market. While pullbacks are expected — since prices never go up in a straight line — many experts believe the market is setting up for another major run. A key support level to watch is $95,280. As long as Bitcoin stays above this, there’s a chance for more upside.",News|Bitcoin|Crypto news|Price Analysis,EN,0,0,ALTCOIN|BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|TRADING,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-05-02 03:41:04

In a written statement , the Commerce Ministry in Beijing said it had “taken note” that senior US officials have repeated their wish to speak with China about the tariffs. “The United States has recently sent messages to China through relevant parties, hoping to start talks with China,” the ministry said. “China is currently evaluating this.” The statement urged officials in the US capital to match their words with “sincerity.” The note gave financial markets fresh hope that the trade standoff between the world’s two largest economies might ease. Futures on the S&P 500 Index wiped out earlier losses during Asian hours, and a widely watched yardstick of regional shares moved into positive territory. Hong Kong’s Hang Seng China Enterprises Index climbed more than 1 percent, while mainland exchanges stayed shut for a holiday. In currency trading, the offshore yuan rose 0.3 percent to 7.2566 per dollar, and the Australian dollar extended its rebound. Talks would mark a shift in a dispute that has rattled businesses on both sides of the Pacific. Last month, Trump pushed import taxes on a broad range of Chinese goods to levels unseen in 100 years, and Beijing retaliated by raising its own tariffs. The U.S. president has said several times that Chinese leader Xi Jinping needs to contact him first if Beijing truly wants to bargain. Earlier this week, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent told reporters that China must take the initial step to break the stalemate. “The high level of reciprocal tariffs on China is not sustainable, so the market expects the U.S. and China to start negotiating at some point,” said Woei Chen Ho, economist at United Overseas Bank Ltd. “The beginning of negotiations will likely drive market volatility again because it is not expected to be plain sailing.” Political moves in Washington could complicate the path forward On Thursday, Trump reshuffled top national‑security posts, expanding Secretary of State Marco Rubio’s duties. Rubio, who became the first US cabinet member sanctioned by Beijing, will act as interim national security adviser while keeping his State Department portfolio. Michael Waltz, the outgoing adviser, will be nominated as US ambassador to the United Nations. Holding both jobs will give Rubio a louder voice on matters that Beijing follows closely, including Taiwan, which China regards as its own territory. The secretary of state has pledged in the past to counter what he calls China’s “destabilizing actions” in the South China Sea. In an interview broadcast Thursday night on Fox News with host Sean Hannity, Rubio said Chinese officials are looking for a “short‑term accommodation” and that the US duties are “taking a huge toll” on China’s economy. “The Chinese are reaching out,” Rubio told Hannity. “They want to meet, they want to talk.” Marco Rubio in a recent interview with Hannity on Fox News. Source: Fox News The White House, the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative, and the Departments of Treasury and Commerce did not answer requests for comment on Friday. Economic pressure inside China is mounting. The official manufacturing purchasing managers’ index released this week showed factory activity sinking into its deepest contraction since December 2023. New export orders fell to the lowest level since December 2022 and recorded their steepest one‑month drop since April 2022, when Shanghai shut down to control a pandemic outbreak. Even while hinting at openness, the Commerce Ministry framed its view as unchanged. As a condition for any talks, the ministry said Washington must first “correct its wrong practices” by lifting the unilateral tariffs. “If we fight, we will fight to the end; if we talk, the door is open,” the statement said. It said, “What China wants to emphasize is that in any possible dialogue or talks, if the United States does not correct its wrong unilateral tariff measures, it means that the United States has no sincerity at all and will further damage the mutual trust between the two sides.” Cryptopolitan Academy: Want to grow your money in 2025?

The company, established by Mike Novogratz, who is a known Bitcoin advocate, will migrate to the Nasdaq from the Toronto Stock Exchange on May 16, subject to approval by the shareholders at a meeting to come. Shareholders To Vote On US Market Move As per reports, Galaxy Digital has called a special meeting of its shareholders for May 9 to secure final approval for the change in listing. The firm will not be exiting the Toronto market in which it listed in July 2020 right away. Rather, it will continue to trade on both exchanges during a transition phase. When the relocation occurs, the firm aims to go by the ticker symbol GLXY on Nasdaq. Galaxy is preparing to list on Nasdaq—and we couldn’t be more excited. AMA! This moment represents a major milestone not just for us, but for the entire digital asset industry. For years, crypto companies in the U.S. have faced a challenging regulatory environment. That’s… — Galaxy (@galaxyhq) April 28, 2025 Novogratz outlined the potential listing as a key move for the company on April 30. He explained that the Nasdaq listing would position the company to advance its vision of building a “gateway for investors” to safely and efficiently access every corner of the digital asset and artificial intelligence ecosystems. The intended relocation is happening at a tough time for Galaxy Digital’s stock performance. According to Google Finance data, shares in the company have fallen 12% on the Toronto Stock Exchange since January 2025. The decline reflects wider market difficulties experienced over recent months. The Nasdaq 100 index itself has declined 7.30% year-to-date, based on TradingView data. But April did provide a bit of stability for markets, with the index finishing the month up over 1%. Some investors believe recent negative sentiment regarding the economy could be excessive. Other Crypto Stocks Show Recent Gains As Galaxy Digital gears up for its listing, various crypto-focused companies already listed on Nasdaq have witnessed their shares increase in April. This follows months of doubt partly triggered by economic worries surrounding tariffs introduced by US President Donald Trump. Cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase (COIN) enjoyed a 17% increase in stock. Michael Saylor’s company, Strategy (MSTR), was even better off, posting a nearly 32% rise. Bitcoin mining firm CleanSpark (CLSK) was also up with a 21% gain, Google Finance figures show. The increases indicate that although there are hiccups in the overall market, there is still keen investor interest in cryptocurrency stocks.
