The company behind the popular AI coding assistant has acquired Graphite, a startup specializing in AI-powered code review and debugging, for a price reportedly ‘way over’ Graphite’s last valuation of $290 million. This acquisition represents more than just another corporate transaction—it’s a fundamental shift in how AI will accelerate software development from conception to deployment. Why Cursor AI’s Graphite Acquisition Changes Everything The timing of this acquisition couldn’t be more strategic. As AI-generated code becomes increasingly common, the quality and reliability of that code have emerged as critical bottlenecks. Developers using AI coding assistants like Cursor AI often find themselves spending significant time debugging and reviewing AI-generated output. Graphite’s specialized technology addresses this exact pain point with innovative features like ‘stacked pull requests,’ which allow developers to work on multiple dependent changes simultaneously without waiting for approvals. This acquisition creates a powerful synergy: Cursor AI’s strength in generating code combined with Graphite’s expertise in reviewing and debugging that same code. The result is a more complete development workflow that could significantly reduce the time between writing code and shipping production-ready software. The Competitive Landscape of AI Code Review Tools Cursor AI isn’t operating in a vacuum. The AI code review space has become increasingly competitive, with several players vying for dominance: Company Valuation Specialization Recent Funding Graphite (now part of Cursor AI) $290M+ AI code review with stacked PRs Acquired by Cursor AI CodeRabbit $550M AI-powered code review Valuation set September 2025 Greptile Undisclosed AI code understanding $25M Series A (Fall 2025) What makes Graphite particularly valuable is its unique approach to the code review process. While Cursor AI already offered AI-powered code review through its Bugbot product, Graphite’s technology represents a more sophisticated, specialized solution that complements rather than duplicates existing capabilities. The Strategic Benefits of Combining AI Coding and Review The integration of Cursor AI and Graphite offers several compelling advantages for software development teams: Faster Development Cycles: By combining code generation with automated review, teams can move from idea to production more rapidly Higher Code Quality: AI-powered review catches bugs and issues that human reviewers might miss Reduced Developer Burnout: Automating repetitive review tasks allows developers to focus on more creative work Consistent Code Standards: AI review ensures all code meets organizational standards automatically Scalable Code Review: Teams can handle larger codebases and more frequent deployments Behind the Deal: The Network Effect of Shared Investors This acquisition wasn’t just about technology—it was also about relationships. The deal reveals an interesting network effect in the venture capital world. Both Cursor AI (through its parent company Anysphere) and Graphite share several key investors, including Accel and Andreessen Horowitz. This common investor base likely facilitated the acquisition discussions and created alignment around strategic goals. Furthermore, the personal connections run deep. Michael Truell, co-founder and CEO of Anysphere, first met Graphite’s co-founders—Merrill Lutsky, Greg Foster, and Thomas Reimers—through the Neo Scholar program before launching Cursor AI. Neo, Ali Partovi’s early-stage venture firm, had backed Graphite at the seed stage, creating a foundation of trust and shared vision that made this acquisition possible. Anysphere’s Aggressive Acquisition Strategy The Graphite acquisition represents just the latest move in Anysphere’s aggressive expansion strategy. The company, which was valued at $29 billion in November 2025, has been actively acquiring complementary technologies and talent: Growth by Design: Acquired last month, this tech recruiting strategy company helps Anysphere attract top talent Koala Talent Acquisition: In July 2025, Anysphere acquired talent from AI-powered CRM startup Koala for a post-money valuation of $129 million Graphite Acquisition: The current deal, which brings specialized AI code review capabilities This pattern suggests that Anysphere is building not just a product, but an entire ecosystem around AI-powered software development. What This Means for Software Development The integration of AI coding assistants with AI review tools represents a fundamental shift in how software gets built. We’re moving toward a future where: AI handles routine coding tasks and initial reviews Human developers focus on architecture, creativity, and complex problem-solving Development cycles accelerate dramatically Code quality improves through consistent, automated review Teams can scale their output without proportional increases in headcount FAQs About the Cursor AI and Graphite Acquisition What is Cursor AI?

In its filings, the crypto exchange is seeking declaratory and injunctive relief, arguing that prediction markets fall under the exclusive jurisdiction of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) rather than state gaming regulators. Who Controls Prediction Markets? The company stated that federal law already assigns regulatory authority for these products to the CFTC, which leaves states without the power to restrict or prohibit them under gambling statutes. The lawsuits come as Coinbase prepares to enter the prediction markets space through a partnership with Kalshi, a CFTC-regulated platform, and plans to roll out event-based contract trading across the US starting in January 2026. Coinbase warned in court filings that state intervention could cause immediate and “irreparable harm” by blocking access to federally regulated products in certain jurisdictions. The company is responding to actions by several states that have sought to classify event contracts, particularly those linked to sports outcomes, as illegal gambling unless operators obtain state-issued betting licenses. According to the crypto exchange, this interpretation conflicts with federal commodities law. The exchange said that Congress granted the CFTC broad authority over derivatives and commodities, with only a limited set of exclusions that do not include sporting events. As such, Coinbase added that sports-related event contracts remain subject to federal oversight. The company has also highlighted the differences between prediction markets and traditional sportsbooks. Unlike casinos, which set odds and profit from customer losses, prediction markets function as neutral venues that match buyers and sellers without taking directional risk. Coinbase’s Chief Legal Officer, Paul Grewal, tweeted “We’re right on the law and the facts. And we will prove it.” The lawsuits arrive amid growing scrutiny from state regulators as prediction markets have surged in popularity. Platforms such as Kalshi and Polymarket have generated billions of dollars in trading volume over the past year and have drawn increased regulatory attention as a result. Earlier this month, Connecticut regulators issued cease-and-desist orders against several companies offering event-based contracts, triggering legal challenges and temporary pauses on enforcement. Prediction Markets Boom Regulatory woes aside, the sector has also seen fresh momentum in 2025 from new product launches, reinforcing expectations of broader adoption. Robinhood CEO Vlad Tenev recently predicted significant long-term growth for crypto-based prediction markets. The exec even described the sector as entering the early stages of a “prediction market supercycle.” Tenev said adoption and trading volumes could expand dramatically as platforms increasingly price real-world events using blockchain infrastructure.

According to the model, all three assets could see extreme volatility, with sharp moves possible to the upside or downside before year-end. Below is a summary of DeepSeek’s dual-track outlook, outlining both optimistic and pessimistic price paths for each cryptocurrency through the end of December. XRP (XRP): DeepSeek AI Warns of Possible Collapse to $0.20 or Moonshot Surge Toward $10 In its bearish case, DeepSeek AI estimates that Ripple’s XRP ($XRP) could fall dramatically from its current level near $1.88 to as low as $0.20. Such a move would imply a drawdown of roughly 89% if selling pressure and negative sentiment intensify. Source: DeepSeek This scenario would sharply contrast with XRP’s strong performance earlier in the year, when the token reached its first new all-time high (ATH) in seven years. XRP peaked at $3.65 in July, shortly after Ripple secured a major legal victory against the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. Throughout much of 2025, XRP has largely traded within a $2 to $3 range. Its relative strength index (RSI) is currently hovering near 39 and trending higher, suggesting renewed interest from traders looking to buy at discounted levels. On the bullish end of the spectrum, DeepSeek projects a decisive breakout that could lift XRP by more than 432%, pushing the price toward $10 by the end of the year. The recent launch of five spot XRP exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in the U.S. could help drive fresh institutional demand during the holiday period, following a pattern previously seen with Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs. More ETF approvals are expected in the months ahead, raising the odds that 2026 becomes a defining year for XRP. Investors building positions at current prices could benefit a lot. Bitcoin (BTC): DeepSeek Sees Path to $250,000 or Pullback to $20,000 Bitcoin ($BTC) , the world’s largest cryptocurrency by market value, set a new all-time high of $126,080 on October 6. Looking further out, DeepSeek’s extended forecast places BTC as high as $200,000 by 2026. Frequently likened to digital gold, Bitcoin continues to draw interest from both institutional and retail investors seeking hedges against economic uncertainty. BTC now accounts for more than $1.75 trillion of the roughly $3.05 trillion total crypto market capitalization. As inflation pressures ease and market sentiment improves heading into the holidays, Bitcoin could attempt another run toward recent highs. The Federal Reserve’s latest interest rate cut may also boost liquidity, supporting risk assets through December. However, DeepSeek cautions that a sustained wave of selling could drag BTC back toward the $20,000 level, marking the start of a crypto winter throughout 2026. Even if it seems very ambitious the AI model maintains that its $200,000 upside target remains plausible in early 2026, particularly if U.S. policymakers deliver clearer crypto regulations and move forward with plans for a U.S. Strategic Bitcoin Reserve. Dogecoin (DOGE): DeepSeek AI Projects Rally to $1 or Slide Toward $0.03 Launched in 2013 as a parody cryptocurrency, Dogecoin ($DOGE) has since grown into a major digital asset with a market capitalization of roughly $22 billion. It now represents close half of the estimated $44 billion meme-coin sector. DOGE formed several bullish chart patterns in late summer and early autumn, but momentum has weakened in recent weeks. Under DeepSeek’s bearish scenario, Dogecoin could fall to around $0.03, marking a decline of about 77% from its current price near $0.1318. Dogecoin’s all-time high of $0.7316 was recorded during the retail-driven rally of 2021, and the long-awaited move to $1 has yet to materialize. Still, DeepSeek’s optimistic outlook suggests DOGE could surprise the market with a rally of more than 650%, potentially reaching parity with the dollar, a 7.5x increase from current levels. Meanwhile, real-world adoption of Dogecoin continues to grow. Tesla accepts DOGE for select merchandise, and major payment platforms such as PayPal and Revolut have added support for Dogecoin transactions. Maxi Doge (MAXI): A Rapidly Growing Meme Coin Not Included in DeepSeek’s Forecast While DeepSeek’s analysis centers on established cryptocurrencies, early-stage presale projects often offer far greater upside potential. One such project attracting increasing attention is Maxi Doge ($MAXI) , which has already raised nearly $4.4 million as it positions itself as a potential successor to Dogecoin. MAXI revolves around the character of Maxi Doge, a high-octane crypto degenerate and distant relative of the original Dogecoin. The project leans heavily into meme culture, portraying Maxi as obsessed with heavy lifting, extreme leverage trading and rallying a hyper-active MAXI DOGE community. Issued as an ERC-20 token, MAXI runs on Ethereum’s proof-of-stake network. This gives it advantages in energy efficiency and developer access compared to Dogecoin’s older proof-of-work architecture. The ongoing presale offers staking rewards of up to 71% APY, though yields are designed to decline as more participants join. MAXI is currently priced at $0.000274 in its latest presale round, with automatic price increases scheduled for future stages. Tokens can be purchased using MetaMask or Best Wallet .

56059654,https://cryptonews.com/?p=466129,1766183700,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/52/56059654.jpeg,"Best Crypto To Buy Now 19 December – XRP, SOL, ETH",https://cryptonews.com/news/best-crypto-to-buy-now-19-december-xrp-sol-eth/,"With speculation growing around a possible 2026 crypto bull run, particularly if U.S. lawmakers finally introduce comprehensive crypto regulations, the period heading into Christmas is shaping up as the best time to load up on crypto if you believe in it. Bitcoin has stayed below the $90,000 level since Sunday, trading steadily above $87,000 over the past 24 hours. A key trend worth noting is Bitcoin’s steady decline in market dominance since summer . Historically, this shift often signals capital rotating from Bitcoin into altcoins. In this environment, projects such as XRP, Solana and Ethereum offer the best potential to grow value in the coming year. XRP (XRP): Reshaping Global Payments Ripple’s XRP ($XRP) remains a major force in the cross-border payments space, thanks to its near-instant transaction speeds and extremely low fees. Built to modernize global payment rails, the XRP Ledger (XRPL) is a faster and cheaper alternative to legacy systems like SWIFT. XRP’s importance has been recognized at the institutional level, with references appearing in reports from the United Nations Capital Development Fund and the White House. Supported by Ripple’s expanding network of fintech partnerships, XRP has climbed to become the third-largest cryptocurrency outside of stablecoins, boasting a market capitalization above $113 billion. Following the resolution of Ripple’s long-running legal battle with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, XRP surged to its first new all-time high (ATH) in seven years, topping out at $3.65. Since then, the token has pulled back by roughly 49% and is currently trading near $1.87. The debut of five spot XRP ETFs in the U.S. has driven fresh institutional interest, though much of the demand is not reflected in current prices, probably due to the market pricing it in. Looking ahead, further ETF approvals and clearer regulatory guidance could act as powerful tailwinds. Under favorable conditions, XRP could move back toward record highs by New Year. Solana (SOL): High-Speed Blockchain Targeting a Potential $1,200 Move Solana ($SOL) has firmly established itself as a leading smart-contract platform, known for its rapid transaction processing and minimal costs. With a market cap around $71 billion and nearly $9 billion in total value locked (TVL) across its DeFi ecosystem, Solana continues to stand out as Ethereum’s strongest rival. Recently launched Solana spot ETFs from firms such as Grayscale and Bitwise could pave the way for meaningful institutional inflows, similar to the capital surges that previously boosted Bitcoin and Ethereum. After sliding to around $100 earlier this year, SOL has rebounded and now trades close to $125, hovering at a key technical support level. Its also below its 30-day moving average, which suggests a small price surge back to $130 or $140 may happen over the weekend. The next significant resistance lies near $250. A clean break above that zone could send SOL past its prior all-time high of $293.31. In a strong holiday-driven rally, SOL could even hit $500 although weak festive performance is unlikely to cause any major losses, so in a bear case, Solana will probably hold the fort somewhere in the support zone it’s currently in. Beyond price action, Solana is also emerging as a preferred network for real-world asset (RWA) tokenization. Major financial players including BlackRock and Franklin Templeton have selected Solana to launch tokenized investment products. Ethereum ($ETH): The Smart-Contract Giant Prepares for Its Next Phase Ethereum ($ETH) continues to underpin decentralized finance and much of the broader Web3 landscape, supported by a market capitalization north of $357 billion. With more than $69 billion TVL , Ethereum remains the dominant platform for smart contracts and decentralized applications, reinforcing its central role in the blockchain ecosystem. In a strong market cycle, ETH could push toward the $6,500 level by the end of the year, a significant leap from its current price around $2,966 and well beyond its previous all-time high of $4,946 set in August. The recent Fusaka upgrade, implemented at the start of the month, substantially improves data availability for Layer-2 networks while enhancing security, efficiency and scalability. These changes could help drive ETH toward $5,000 before month-end. That said, a move to five figures will likely depend on clearer U.S. regulations and a supportive macroeconomic environment, both of which could unlock greater institutional participation. Earlier this year, ETH broke out from a bullish flag formation, rallying from $1,800 to a fresh peak. Sustained momentum will be essential if Ethereum is to get a new ATH by New Year.

On-chain metrics show little evidence of broad holder distribution, suggesting that these dips are not being driven by investors exiting their positions. Instead, the weakness in price appears to stem from the market structure issues. Why Structural Weakness Is Often Temporary These Bitcoin dips aren’t coming from selling pressure; they’re coming from stablecoin-denominated shorts. The co-founder of GlydeGG, Sweep, revealed on X that when large amounts of leverage enter the system through dollar or stablecoin, market makers don’t just let the price move. Related Reading: The Bearish Structure That Puts Bitcoin Price At $92,550, And Then $82,000 Their mandate is to remain neutral because neutrality demands balance. They achieve this by selling spot BTC, not because they’re bearish, but because neutrality requires it. As a result of that, the price drops without fear, panic, and without real spot. The United States doesn’t need to dump assets to influence global markets; it exports dollars. Those dollars become leverage, while leverage creates synthetic pressure, which in turn forces hedging, and hedging hits the spot markets; that’s the cycle. This is why recent sell-offs feel empty, because retail has already left. Currently, the market is rebalancing within a system price against a weakening currency, and all markets are now denominated in a currency that’s losing purchasing power. That’s why volatility rises even when conviction doesn’t change. This isn’t a bear market; it’s clearing the Liquidity Providers (LPs), which is how big players buy BTC cheaply without ever owning it. How Bitcoin Supply Dynamics Are Entering A New Phase An ambassador and partner of Wolfswapdotapp, Crypto Miners, has pointed out that the Bitcoin supply dynamics are shifting fast. According to K33Research, nearly $300 billion worth of previously dormant BTC re-entered circulation in 2025. This supply release has been driven by long-term holder sales, large OTC transactions, and ETF-related absorption, which represents one of the largest supply unlocks in BTC history. Related Reading: Bitcoin’s Make-or-Break Phase Begins: Weekly Support Holds, Momentum Fades On-chain data from CryptoQuant has shown that the long-term holder distribution over the last 30 days has reached its highest level in more than five years. At the same time, the selling pressure currently is outweighing demand, as ETF flows turn negative, and retail participation has weakened. Despite near-term fragility, K33 noted that this distribution phase may be approaching exhaustion. The early holder selling is expected to fade into early 2026, potentially setting the stage for renewed accumulation as institutional rebalancing stabilizes supply. For now, the markets remain sensitive, but structurally, this looks like a late-cycle supply redistribution rather than panic selling.

Transaction data surrounding $NIGHT tokens has now grown into new milestones in just a few weeks after launch . Although the entire market conditions are far from bullish, the surge in transaction count points to a structural increase in real activity on the Cardano blockchain. NIGHT Token Activity Sparks A Transaction Surge On Cardano The momentum traces back to data highlighted by blockchain explorer Cexplorer.io on the social media platform X . On Wednesday, the platform flagged that Cardano had processed over 122,000 transactions that contained the $NIGHT token, the native asset of the Midnight network. That figure has since adjusted, and transaction activity has been increasing since then. At the time of writing, the number of recorded transactions containing $NIGHT stands at 141,363, which indicates continued movement across wallets since their launch. This pattern shows that users are actively interacting with the token following its launch and that Cardano’s base layer is handling meaningful throughput tied directly to user engagement. What The Data Says About The Network’s Health The recent transaction data paints a more encouraging picture for Cardano, particularly in light of the long-standing narrative that the network lacks organic on-chain activity. For years, the network has often been dismissed as a so-called ghost chain, with critics arguing about its organic usage. This perception has also carried over into Cardano’s DeFi metrics, where co-founder Charles Hoskinson has previously pointed to a gap between on-chain application usage and the roughly 1.3 million users actively participating in Cardano’s staking system. Furthermore, the creation of Midnight and its native token NIGHT is positive for Cardano as a deliberate expansion of its ecosystem. Midnight was designed as a privacy-focused blockchain that works alongside the network to address long-standing concerns around confidential computation and data protection while still aligning with regulatory and compliance expectations. The Midnight sidechain uses zero-knowledge cryptography, and developers can build applications where sensitive information can still be private while allowing selective disclosure when needed. This approach positions Midnight as a practical privacy layer that fits into real-world use cases. The design and launch mechanics for Midnight and NIGHT make it so that community members needed to claim their token allocations through an official redemption portal and wait for them to thaw or unlock according to a predetermined schedule before they could be moved or fully utilized. On-chain activity tied to $NIGHT is one positive to look at amidst the current state of the Cardano network and its price action, which has been under persistent bearish pressure. ADA is trading at a 2025 low around the mid-$0.30s, which is indicative of the selling pressure across the entire crypto market.",Cardano|ADA|ADA news|ADA Price|adausd|ADAUSDT|Cardano blockchain|Cardano ecosystem|Cardano network|Cardano news|Cardano Price|Cexplorer.io|Charles Hoskinson|Midnight|NIGHT,EN,0,0,ADA|BLOCKCHAIN|MARKET|TRADING|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-12-19 23:00:48

According to his recent remarks, Portnoy considers the $1.75 range an attractive point to make a large purchase, describing it as a favorable entry after XRP’s recent pullback. XRP is currently trading near $1.87, following a short-term decline that briefly pushed the token to an intraday low of approximately $1.77, based on CoinGecko data. While the broader crypto market remains volatile, Portnoy appears to be monitoring XRP closely as it consolidates below recent highs. A Year Marked by Reversals Portnoy’s involvement with XRP throughout the year has been marked by frequent changes in positioning and sentiment. He has openly stated that his interest in the token is not driven by an assessment of its underlying technology or long-term fundamentals. Last night I bought $2,000,000 in crypto. When there’s blood in the streets I’m like a Great White Shark #DDTG pic.twitter.com/aKUXFoD4Xy — Dave Portnoy (@stoolpresidente) November 18, 2025 Instead, he has framed his participation as speculative, motivated largely by market momentum and fear of missing out. Earlier in the year, Portnoy publicly embraced XRP during a period of strong upward price movement, making bold statements about its potential and aligning himself closely with its retail supporter base. However, this optimism proved short-lived. In June, he exited his entire XRP position, which he later estimated to be worth around $3 million, selling near the $2.40 level. The decision reportedly followed a warning from an associate regarding possible regulatory risks tied to stablecoins and their broader implications for Ripple-related assets. Shortly after Portnoy sold, XRP rallied sharply , climbing to roughly $3.65. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 He later expressed public frustration over the timing of his exit, acknowledging that the move cost him substantial unrealized gains. Re-Entry and Current Strategy Following a subsequent market-wide downturn, Portnoy re-entered the crypto market, allocating about $1 million across XRP, Bitcoin, and Ethereum. He later confirmed that he rebuilt his XRP position around the $2.14 level, characterizing the earlier sell-off as an overreaction rather than a structural shift in outlook. With XRP now trading below its November levels, Portnoy appears prepared to adjust his position again. He has suggested that a decline to $1.75 would prompt him to either lower his average entry price or meaningfully increase the size of his holdings. While Portnoy’s trading approach continues to draw criticism for its emotional nature, his comments frequently attract attention due to his public profile. As XRP continues to fluctuate, his stated plans add to ongoing speculation around short-term price movements, though they remain personal views rather than investment guidance.

This announcement, made via the exchange’s X account, signals a significant step for the Brevis (BREV) token and its potential investors. For anyone tracking the evolution of digital assets, understanding what this roadmap inclusion means is crucial. It’s not a guaranteed listing, but it’s a powerful vote of confidence from one of the world’s largest and most regulated cryptocurrency exchanges. What Does It Mean When Coinbase Adds BREV to Its Roadmap? First, let’s demystify the ‘listing roadmap.’ This is a public-facing document where Coinbase announces assets it is considering for future trading support. When Coinbase adds BREV to this list, it indicates the token has passed initial technical and compliance reviews. It enters a queue for deeper evaluation. This process enhances transparency and allows the community to anticipate potential new listings. Therefore, the news is a bullish signal, though final approval is not automatic. Why Is Brevis (BREV) Gaining This Attention? To understand why the decision for Coinbase to add BREV matters, we must look at the Brevis project itself. Brevis is a cross-chain smart contract platform designed to improve how blockchains communicate and share data. Its core promise is greater interoperability—a key challenge in today’s fragmented crypto ecosystem. The potential listing on a major exchange like Coinbase could provide the liquidity, visibility, and credibility needed to accelerate its adoption. This move suggests that Coinbase’s evaluators see merit in Brevis’s underlying technology and market potential. What Are the Immediate Implications for Traders? The immediate effect is often market speculation. News that Coinbase adds BREV typically triggers increased trading activity for the token on other decentralized and centralized exchanges where it is already available. However, savvy investors know this is a moment for research, not impulsive action. Consider these points: Increased Scrutiny: The token will be under a microscope, with every project detail examined by the market. Volatility: Price swings based on rumor and anticipation are common around roadmap announcements. Long-term vs. Short-term: The real value is in the project’s fundamentals, not just the exchange hype. How Does This Fit Coinbase’s Broader Strategy? This isn’t an isolated event. Coinbase adds tokens like BREV as part of a deliberate strategy to expand its altcoin offerings and cater to a diverse user base seeking exposure to innovative protocols. By carefully selecting projects that address real-world blockchain problems—like interoperability—Coinbase strengthens its position as a gateway to the next generation of web3. Each new asset broadens the ecosystem accessible through its user-friendly platform. What Should Potential Investors Do Next? If you’re considering BREV after hearing Coinbase adds it to the roadmap, a disciplined approach is key. First, conduct your own research (DYOR). Visit the official Brevis website, read its whitepaper, and understand its use cases. Second, monitor official channels for updates from both Brevis and Coinbase. Finally, remember that inclusion on the roadmap is one step in a longer journey. A final listing decision could take weeks or months, and the market can change rapidly in that time. Conclusion: A Step Toward Mainstream Recognition The announcement that Coinbase adds BREV to its listing roadmap is a pivotal moment for the Brevis project. It represents a bridge between innovative blockchain technology and mainstream crypto accessibility. While it brings exciting possibilities for liquidity and growth, it also demands cautious optimism from the community. The focus should remain on the project’s long-term utility and development progress. As the crypto landscape evolves, strategic endorsements from major exchanges will continue to be a critical factor in shaping which projects succeed. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q: Does Coinbase adding BREV to the roadmap guarantee it will be listed? A: No, it does not guarantee a listing. It means the asset is under official consideration and has passed preliminary checks. The final decision depends on further technical and legal reviews. Q: When will BREV be listed on Coinbase if approved? A: Coinbase does not provide specific timelines for assets on its roadmap. The process can vary in length based on multiple factors. Q: Can I buy BREV on Coinbase now? A> No, not yet. The token is only on the listing roadmap. It is not available for trading on Coinbase until an official listing announcement is made. Q: Where can I trade BREV currently? A> BREV may be available on other cryptocurrency exchanges or decentralized platforms (DEXs). Always use reputable sources and verify contract addresses to avoid scams. Q: What is the main purpose of the Brevis (BREV) token? A> Brevis aims to enable cross-chain smart contracts, allowing different blockchains to communicate and share data securely, solving a major interoperability challenge. Q: How does a Coinbase listing typically affect a token’s price? A> Listing announcements often lead to increased buying pressure and price volatility due to greater accessibility and credibility, but past performance does not guarantee future results.

56061409,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=248371,1766187911,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,The Contrarian Truth: Why Bitcoin and Ethereum Prices Defy Social Media Sentiment,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/bitcoin-ethereum-social-media-sentiment/,"BitcoinWorld The Contrarian Truth: Why Bitcoin and Ethereum Prices Defy Social Media Sentiment Have you ever noticed that when everyone on social media is screaming ‘buy,’ the market often does the opposite? A fascinating analysis from crypto data firm Santiment reveals a powerful pattern: Bitcoin and Ethereum prices frequently move opposite to prevailing social media sentiment . This contrarian signal could be the key to avoiding herd mentality and making more informed investment decisions. What is the Social Media Sentiment Indicator? Social media sentiment refers to the overall mood or opinion expressed by retail investors on platforms like Twitter, Reddit, and Telegram. When sentiment is ‘bullish,’ the crowd is optimistic and expects prices to rise. ‘Bearish’ sentiment reflects fear or pessimism. Santiment’s data scientists track millions of posts to gauge this collective emotion. Their historical analysis shows a clear, counter-intuitive trend. Periods of extreme bullish chatter often precede price dips for both Bitcoin and Ethereum. Conversely, when fear dominates the conversation, a price recovery may be on the horizon. This pattern turns the common wisdom of ‘following the crowd’ on its head. Why Does This Inverse Relationship Happen? This phenomenon isn’t magic; it’s market psychology. When social media sentiment reaches a peak of euphoria, it often means most interested buyers have already entered the market. This leaves little new capital to drive prices higher, creating a sell opportunity. Consider these key drivers: Crowd Psychology: Extreme optimism can signal a market top, while pervasive fear can indicate a bottom. Whale Activity: Large, savvy investors may use retail sentiment as a counter-indicator for their moves. Market Efficiency: By the time a trend is dominant on social media, it’s often already priced in. How Can Traders Use This Insight? Santiment notes this pattern holds true across different strategies, from short-term swing trading to long-term investing. Therefore, monitoring social media sentiment can provide a valuable layer of context. For example, a trader might view overwhelmingly positive chatter as a potential warning sign to take profits or avoid new long positions. On the flip side, a wave of negative posts during a stable or rising market could hint at an undervalued buying opportunity. It’s not a perfect timing tool, but a powerful gauge of market extremes. What Are the Limitations of Sentiment Analysis? While insightful, sentiment data is just one piece of the puzzle. Relying on it alone is risky. Major news events, regulatory announcements, or macroeconomic shifts can override sentiment trends. Furthermore, sentiment analysis tools measure volume and tone, but cannot always distinguish between informed opinion and uninformed hype. Always combine sentiment indicators with: Technical analysis of price charts On-chain data (like exchange flows) Fundamental news and developments This multi-faceted approach leads to more robust decision-making. Actionable Takeaways for Your Crypto Strategy To leverage this insight, start by following credible data providers like Santiment that quantify social media sentiment . Practice observing the mood on your own feeds with a critical eye. When you feel the strong urge to buy because ‘everyone’ is bullish, pause and consider if the smart move might be to wait or even sell. Remember, successful investing often involves being fearful when others are greedy, and greedy when others are fearful. This timeless advice finds a modern, data-backed expression in the inverse relationship between crypto prices and online chatter. Conclusion: The Wisdom of the Contrarian The next time your social media feed is flooded with moon predictions or doom scenarios, take a deep breath. Santiment’s analysis provides a compelling reason to question the herd. By understanding that Bitcoin and Ethereum prices have a history of moving against the tide of popular social media sentiment , you equip yourself with a powerful contrarian lens. Use this knowledge not for reckless bets, but for disciplined, emotionally-detached analysis that can help you buy low and sell high. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q: Does this mean social media sentiment is always wrong? A: No. It means extreme sentiment often marks market turning points. Mild or neutral sentiment can coincide with steady trends. Q: Which social media platforms are most important for this analysis? A: Twitter (X) and Reddit are primary sources due to their large, vocal crypto communities. Telegram and Discord are also significant. Q: Can this strategy be applied to altcoins, not just Bitcoin and Ethereum? A: The principle may apply, but altcoins are often more susceptible to hype and manipulation, so sentiment can be a noisier signal. Q: How quickly do prices react to sentiment shifts? A> There’s no fixed timeline. Sometimes the reaction is within days, sometimes weeks. It signals a potential shift, not an immediate guarantee. Q: Where can I find reliable sentiment data? A> Firms like Santiment, LunarCrush, and The TIE offer specialized sentiment tracking tools and indices for cryptocurrencies. Found this insight into market psychology valuable?

Pro-crypto US Senator Cynthia Lummis, a powerful Republican voice from Wyoming, has announced she will not seek re-election after her current term ends. This decision marks a pivotal moment for digital asset policy in the United States. Who is Cynthia Lummis and Why Does Her Cryptocurrency Stance Matter? Cynthia Lummis is not just another senator. She chairs the Senate Banking Committee’s Subcommittee on Digital Assets, placing her at the epicenter of financial technology legislation. Her advocacy for clear, innovation-friendly cryptocurrency regulation has made her a cornerstone for the industry. In a post on X, she stated that serving Wyoming has been the honor of her life and that her decision came after careful thought. Her work extends beyond committee hearings. Lummis actively promoted legislation for a Bitcoin strategic reserve during the Trump administration, showcasing her forward-thinking approach to national finance. Therefore, her departure creates a vacuum in congressional crypto expertise. What Was Cynthia Lummis’s Vision for Cryptocurrency? Senator Lummis championed a regulatory framework that balanced consumer protection with fostering innovation. She understood that overly restrictive rules could push the burgeoning cryptocurrency industry overseas. Her efforts focused on: Clarity: Defining which agencies regulate different digital assets. Innovation: Creating sandboxes for new financial technologies. Strategic Adoption: Exploring how national reserves could include assets like Bitcoin. This vision made her a rare bipartisan figure on a complex issue. However, with her planned exit, the future of these initiatives becomes uncertain. What Does This Mean for the Future of Cryptocurrency Regulation? The announcement that Cynthia Lummis will not seek re-election sends ripples through the crypto community. Her leadership provided a consistent and knowledgeable voice in often chaotic legislative debates. The immediate questions are: Who will fill her role as a leading cryptocurrency advocate in the Senate? Will her bipartisan legislative efforts lose momentum? How will the industry adjust its lobbying strategy? Moreover, her absence may slow down critical bills aimed at providing regulatory clarity for exchanges, stablecoins, and custody services. The industry must now identify and support new champions who understand the technology’s potential and risks. How Can the Cryptocurrency Industry Respond? While the news is significant, it is not a catastrophe. The groundwork laid by advocates like Cynthia Lummis has educated many of her colleagues. The industry’s response should be strategic: Engage Early: Support and educate candidates running for her seat. Build Coalitions: Work with remaining pro-innovation senators from both parties. Focus on Education: Continue demystifying cryptocurrency for policymakers. The goal is to ensure the thoughtful approach championed by Senator Lummis continues, even after she leaves office. Conclusion: A Legacy of Cryptocurrency Advocacy Cynthia Lummis’s decision not to seek re-election closes a vital chapter in Washington’s relationship with digital assets. Her legacy as a pro-crypto senator provides a blueprint for future policymakers: combine principled advocacy with a deep understanding of the technology. The challenge now is for the industry and its allies to build upon her work, ensuring the United States remains competitive in the global financial revolution. The departure of a figure like Cynthia Lummis underscores that political support is not permanent and requires constant, engaged cultivation.

This marks a notable 30% decline over the past few months. Despite this setback, analysts at Citi express optimism for the cryptocurrency’s future, forecasting that its value will continue to rise through 2026. Optimistic Bitcoin Price Predictions According to Citi’s analysts, the base case for the Bitcoin price is set at $143,000, reflecting a potential 62% increase from current levels. In a more bullish scenario, the cryptocurrency could surge to over $189,000, indicating a substantial 114% increase. Conversely, the analysts also present a bear case for the leading crypto, with an estimated price around $78,500, which would represent an additional 10.6% decline from current trading levels. Related Reading: Solana (SOL) Support Shattered, Potential $100 Test Looms, Says Analyst The forecast from Citi relies on the assumption that investor adoption will persist, particularly with an influx of funds into exchange-traded funds (ETFs) projected to reach $15 billion. This influx is seen as a catalyst that could significantly boost the Bitcoin price. Furthermore, ongoing negotiations in the US Senate regarding their version of the crypto market structure bill, namely the CLARITY Act, which aims to regulate Bitcoin under the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), is anticipated to enhance market adoption. In contrast to Bitcoin, analysts express concerns regarding Ethereum’s (ETH) potential for growth. They argue that Ethereum, being viewed more as “programmable money,” has seen decreased activity, which has resulted in its current trading price of just below $3,000—40% below its all-time high of $4,964. Additional Catalyst For Price Growth Chris Neiger, an analyst at The Motley Fool, also attaches bullish predictions to the Bitcoin price future, highlighting that recent US job data reflects an unemployment rate increase to 4.6%, the highest since 2021. He asserted that if the Federal Reserve (Fed) chose to lower interest rates by 2026, the Bitcoin price could benefit since lower rates typically enhance the cryptocurrency’s value by making borrowing more affordable. In November, JPMorgan provided a more conservative estimate, suggesting that Bitcoin could reach $170,000 by 2026, with potential upside expected over the next six to twelve months.

Additionally, the establishment of the Strategic Bitcoin Reserve by the federal government has encouraged states to consider similar initiatives. Neiger concludes that just as ETFs have contributed to the credibility of cryptocurrencies and facilitated price increases, the formation of state-level Bitcoin reserves could serve as another critical driver propelling Bitcoin’s value higher in 2026.

BITO has maintained positive NAV and compelling distributions, even amid Bitcoin’s volatility; recent NAV growth is 63.77% over three years. Current downward pressure on BITO is viewed as temporary, with confidence in Bitcoin’s long-term upward trajectory supporting a bullish outlook. BITO is best used as a 3–5% portfolio allocation for income, with diversification and position sizing critical to managing Bitcoin-driven risks. Bullish Thesis Based upon my bullish outlook for Bitcoin heading into 2026, I see BITO surprising to the upside — with both growth and income as the price of Bitcoin jumps. My reason for being so bullish with Bitcoin is, first, the growing adaption by institutional investors and even countries, along with favorable support from the U.S. and other governments. For those reasons, and the conviction the four-year Bitcoin cycle of the past is over, makes me believe 2026 is going to be a good year for the crypto. Why I believe the four-year cycle is over is because the low amount of Bitcoin being mined from its inherent code, makes the number of new Bitcoin available less important, even as growing scarcity further props up the price. Growing demand and decreasing supply is the perfect recipe for the bull market in Bitcoin to continue. Bitcoin should continue to climb for some time into the future, but it'll continue to experience a lot of volatility, which will be a positive outcome for BITO. If my bullish thesis is correct, it means BITO will not only increase its distribution because of the option premiums generating income but will also enjoy growth in the share price of the ETF from the strength of Bitcoin's upward growth trajectory. Overview ProShares Bitcoin ETF ( BITO ) is the first ETF in the U.S. that was linked to Bitcoin (BTC-USD). It has consistently paid out hefty distributions on a consistent basis since it was introduced in October 2021. After Bitcoin reached its all-time high, the inevitable correction came, and the share price of BITO came under pressure in alignment with the price movement of Bitcoin. It doesn't own Bitcoin but utilizes swaps and futures to generate income for shareholders. Even with the volatility associated with Bitcoin, BITO has been able to maintain positive NAV during the time it has paid out distributions, as of the end of November 2025. Over the last three years NAV has been a positive 63.77%, although from inception it is at positive $3.98%. The reason for that is almost at the time of the introduction of the fund Bitcoin corrected for about a year. Seeking Alpha Since then, up until recently, it has experienced a prolonged upward move, along with the usual volatility. The performance of BITO moved in conjunction with the price movement of Bitcoin. In this article we'll look at why I believe BITO has an excellent future ahead of it, and why the current downward pressure should be only temporary. What It Is and What It does BITO used swaps and futures contracts with Bitcoin as the underlying, resulting in strong income generation which is paid out monthly. The primary purpose of the ETF is to generate income. It can at time generate growth, but it's a byproduct of the holding, not the main reason for introducing it to investors. I like how it works because there are other Bitcoin growth products that can be invested in, such as iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF (IBIT). Some have argued that it's better to invest in IBIT rather than BITO, but when the purpose to take a position in BITO is to generate consistent income, IBIT or similar ETFs don't make any sense in that regard. What the fund managers do is invest in Bitcoin futures traded on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange ((CME)). Being actively managed, the ETF managers can roll the contracts over, bringing ongoing exposure to the flagship crypto. That allows fund managers to provide investors exposure to the volatility related to Bitcoin in order to generate income. The risk associated with the strategy is if the price of Bitcoin remains subdued for a prolonged period of time. BITO and Bitcoin As mentioned above, BITO uses swaps and futures to generate income based upon the volatility associated with Bitcoin. How Bitcoin performs is how BITO will perform. For that reason, investors should have a solid grasp of Bitcoin in order to understand the strengths and weaknesses of BITO. If one isn't familiar and knowledgeable about Bitcoin, it would be easy to sell off if total returns start to show a loss. There is also the probability of being influenced by those that oppose Bitcoin and ETFs like BITO, primarily because they operate from a growth mindset. If one believes in Bitcoin, then BITO is an excellent way to gain exposure for those seeking to add significant income to one's overall portfolio. Seeking Alpha For me, I've been in Bitcoin for many years and have a solid grasp of what it is, why its future looks very bright, and why I believe the current correction is temporary. I see pullbacks as only breathers for the next lag up. With that in mind, it would take a lot for me to sell my BITO shares, even when they get hit hard like they have been. BITO Distributions BITO's distribution history is unique in that it actually struggled to pay out a strong dividend in 2023, where usually in the earlier stages of an ETF like BITO, they tend to pay out much higher earlier on and decline in payouts as the fund ages. Seeking Alpha As it went into 2024, the fund distributions started picking, with its highest and most consistent distributions coming in April 2024 to the end of the year, where it paid out well over $1.00 per share or unit at that time, and the two times it was under that it was $0.99 and change. In 2025 the distributions dropped a little but still paid out over $0.75 per share or unit, with the exceptions of $0.36 in April 2025, and $0.54 in May 2025. After that, distributions jumped nicely, even under more adverse conditions. Seeking Alpha What I particularly like about BITO is it had a long enough track record now to see how distributions are affected by the performance of Bitcoin, and so far, with a few exceptions, it continues to pay out a solid distribution monthly. Being able to do that while maintaining positive NAV is a strong accomplishment. I expect there to be a slight downturn in NAV for the quarter ended December 2025, because of the weakness in Bitcoin, but it shouldn't be much more than a slight turn to the red. Nonetheless, even if it turns to the red some with NAV and or its share price during this period of time, being able to pay out the level of distributions it is has done from month to month, makes it a strong performer in the high-yield income space. Risks Bitcoin risk The most obvious risk for BITO is its exposure to Bitcoin price movements. If the price of Bitcoin were to continue to be under pressure longer than expected by the market or investor, it would result in the probability of NAV erosion until the price of Bitcoin rebounds. While we haven't seen it in the ETF yet in any meaningful way, it's possible if Bitcoin were to remain under downward pressure it could result in distributions dropping to levels not experienced for any significant period of the fund since early 2024. Again, what has impressed me so far with BITO is how it has responded so well to the volatile nature of Bitcoin. It has dropped little in distribution levels from 2024 to 2025, but they still remain very compelling in a challenging market environment. Yet, how Bitcoin goes will be how BITO goes, and having exposure to only one underlying does present risk if the underlying underperforms for a long period of time. Portfolio risk Another risk not also thought of by investors is portfolio risk. What I mean by that is income-generating holdings like BITO should be part of an overall portfolio, rather than a standalone income holding. Those that aren't diversified and properly managing position sizing, could get hit harder than they need to be if they only have one or a few high-income yielding ETFs. Under that scenario, the risk is very high if even one of them gets hit hard. After all, the point of income is to be able to generate it without a portfolio shrinking disproportionately because of only a few, riskier holdings that have the potential to crash at some time. It's understandable when an investor is starting to build an income portfolio, because you have to start somewhere. But as shares are acquired it should be done with the idea that as soon as possible one should start adding shares from other income-generating ETFs as well. I tend to think of an ETF like BITO being in the 3% to 5% range of an overall income portfolio. For those that understand Bitcoin well and are bullish on the long-term future of it, maybe a little higher level of position sizing would be appropriate. That said, I would still continue to work on building a diversified portfolio and gradually work in a higher weighting for those that are bullish on BITO. How this is done should be considered in light of age, years to retirement, and specific income investing goals of each individual investor. Conclusion My BITO shares have been hit hard lately, but I don't even think in terms of selling any of them. I'm absolutely convinced the price of Bitcoin has a long, upward growth trajectory ahead of it, and BITO is an excellent way to ride that thesis. Not only will BITO continue to generate impressive income for those holding the ETF, but they, based upon past performance of the ETF in correlation with the price movement of Bitcoin, should also enjoy growth along with it. I don't invest in BITO with expectations I'll get any growth out of it, but after studying and owning a number of high-yield ETFs, it's among one that I'm most bullish on for growth and income long into the future. Before the recent decline in the price of Bitcoin, BITO was producing both growth and income for me, and I expect to continue to do so when Bitcoin reverses direction.",BITO,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|TRADING|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Seeking Alpha', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/seekingalpha.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",seekingalpha,2025-12-20 00:00:09

According to Coinbase’s latest market outlook, the answer is a resounding yes. The leading U.S. exchange projects that by 2026, digital assets will play a significantly larger and more integrated role in the core crypto financial system . This shift promises to reshape how we save, invest, and transact. Let’s explore the key drivers behind this pivotal forecast. What’s Driving Crypto Into the Mainstream Financial System? Coinbase’s ‘2026 Crypto Market Outlook’ identifies several powerful forces converging to push crypto into the mainstream. First, the report highlights the urgent need for clearer regulatory frameworks. Clear rules provide the certainty that large institutions require to invest confidently.

What Challenges Must the Crypto Financial System Overcome? However, the path to 2026 is not without hurdles. For the crypto financial system to gain widespread trust, the industry must prioritize product quality and security. User experience needs to become as simple as using a traditional banking app. Moreover, regulatory compliance is non-negotiable. Projects that proactively work within legal frameworks will likely thrive, while others may falter. The focus must remain on building infrastructure that is not only innovative but also reliable and safe for everyone. Your Actionable Insights for the Coming Shift What does this mean for you? As the crypto financial system matures, education becomes your most valuable asset. Start by understanding the basics of trends like tokenization. Follow regulatory developments, as they will signal which areas of crypto are gaining official recognition. For investors, consider diversifying into projects focused on utility—like payment platforms or RWA protocols—rather than speculation alone. The next two years will be crucial for laying the groundwork of a more open and efficient financial future. In conclusion, Coinbase’s 2026 outlook paints a compelling picture of integration. Cryptocurrency is shedding its niche status and preparing to become a fundamental layer of the global crypto financial system . Driven by regulation, institutional adoption, and groundbreaking technology, this transition promises greater financial inclusion and innovation. The message is clear: the future of finance is being built on the blockchain, and it’s arriving sooner than many think. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) What does Coinbase mean by the ‘core financial system’? It refers to everyday banking, payments, asset trading, and lending—the essential services currently dominated by traditional banks and institutions. Crypto aims to integrate into and improve these areas. Why is 2026 seen as a pivotal year? By 2026, key regulatory frameworks, like the EU’s MiCA, will be fully active. Additionally, several years of technological development and institutional testing will have culminated in more mature, widely available products. What is real-world asset (RWA) tokenization? It’s the process of creating a digital token on a blockchain that represents ownership of a physical asset, like real estate or gold. This makes buying, selling, and dividing ownership of such assets easier and faster. How will stablecoins change payments? Stablecoins can settle transactions in seconds for minimal cost, 24/7. This is a major upgrade over current international bank transfers, which can take days and incur high fees. Is this growth guaranteed? No. Coinbase’s outlook is a projection. Its realization depends on continued positive regulatory developments, technological success, and broader economic stability. How should a beginner prepare for these changes? Focus on learning. Use reputable sources to understand blockchain basics, follow major news from established companies like Coinbase, and never invest more than you can afford to lose in this evolving space.

Here’s Why",https://timestabloid.com/you-need-to-hold-at-least-2314-xrp-heres-why/,"Recent shifts in XRP’s wallet distribution are changing what qualifies as meaningful ownership. As the asset trades around $2.04, the number of tokens required to reach higher holder tiers continues to decline, while the financial commitment needed to do so rises steadily. XRP Wallet Distribution According to recent data , the top 10% of XRP holders now includes roughly 739,970 wallets. To enter this group, a wallet must hold at least 2,314 tokens, which translates to an investment of about $4,720 at current market prices. This marks a significant shift compared with previous years. In June 2024, investors needed approximately 3,300 XRP to reach the same tier. At that time, XRP traded near $0.47, putting the total cost at roughly $1,551. By January 2025, the threshold had already fallen to around 2,599 XRP as prices moved higher. Rising prices reduce the number of tokens required to represent a top-tier position, even as the capital required increases. Crypto experts such as Alpha Lions Academy founder Edoardo Farina still believe accumulation is a good idea at current levels . XRP Ownership Remains Highly Concentrated Despite the lower token threshold for the top 10%, XRP ownership remains heavily concentrated at the upper end. The top 1% of wallets consists of about 73,997 addresses, each holding at least 48,930 XRP. At current prices, that exposure is valued at close to $100,000. In total, the XRP network has approximately 7.4 million wallets. The vast majority hold relatively small balances. Around 6 million wallets contain 500 XRP or fewer, while roughly 3.498 million addresses hold no more than 20 XRP. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Regulatory Progress and Institutional Demand The rising financial barrier to entering higher ownership tiers strengthens the case for accumulation. This view is supported by recent regulatory and institutional developments. The company has received conditional approval from the OCC to launch Ripple National Trust Bank. Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse shared his excitement, describing the move as a major step for U.S. expansion and for RLUSD. Commentators believe this approval enhances regulatory credibility and institutional trust across Ripple’s ecosystem. At the same time, XRP exchange-traded funds (ETFs) have recorded strong demand. Inflows are approaching $1 billion, with over 30 days of net inflows since the first launch. Investors looking to capitalize on the current momentum can join the top 10% of XRP holders with just 2,314 tokens. Farina has previously stated that not holding at least 1,000 XRP is insanity . Smart investors will strive to join the top 10% and secure their spot at the top of the XRP ecosystem. Disclaimer : This content is meant to inform and should not be considered financial advice.

56063077,647039,1766188840,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/56063077.jpeg,Quantum Computing Will Trigger A Bitcoin Supply Shock: Michael Saylor,https://bitcoinist.com/quantum-computing-bitcoin-supply-michael-saylor/,"Quantum computing has become a durable risk narrative for Bitcoin. This week, Galaxy Digital head of research Alex Thorn sat down with Strategy executive chairman Michael Saylor addressing the issue, shortly after Saylor posted his own “Bitcoin Quantum Leap” thesis on X. “The Bitcoin Quantum Leap: Quantum computing won’t break Bitcoin—it will harden it. The network upgrades, active coins migrate, lost coins stay frozen. Security goes up. Supply comes down. Bitcoin grows stronger,” Saylor wrote on Dec. 16, 2025. Saylor Doubles Down On Freezing Dormant Bitcoin In Thorn’s interview , Saylor’s argument is less a cryptography lesson than a coordination claim: when a quantum threat is broadly recognized, the response will not be optional, and Bitcoin will follow the same upgrade logic as the rest of the digital economy. “There’s going to be a point when the world will form a consensus that there’s a quantum threat. We’re not there now, but you won’t miss it because the United States government will direct all of the defense contractors to upgrade their encryption algorithms to be quantum resistant,” Saylor said. He described a cascade in which major platforms ship standardized quantum-resistant libraries across consumer devices and core financial systems, with enforced timelines and re-authentication requirements. In that scenario, Saylor suggested, Bitcoin’s transition would be a software upgrade problem, not an existential crisis. “They will ship an upgrade and they will say please install the new client software and reauthenticate yourself. And you’ve got X days, 90 days, 30 days… And if you don’t, we’re going to freeze your funds. For your own good,” Saylor said. Saylor repeatedly returned to incentives as the decisive factor. In his view, owners of meaningful balances will not rationally opt out of an upgrade that preserves access to their holdings, and the same logic extends to the broader ecosystem’s ability to reach rough consensus. “The Bitcoin network just runs on software. There’s going to be a quantum upgrade . It’s going to have quantum resistant encryption libraries,” he said, adding that he would expect those to align with widely adopted standards shipped across operating systems and enterprise infrastructure. Where his answer becomes more explicitly market-relevant is in the downstream implication: coins that can be migrated will be migrated, and coins that cannot be migrated — because the holders are deceased or keys are irretrievable — would remain stranded. Saylor framed that as a security hardening event that also forces a clearer accounting of lost supply. “We’re going to re-encrypt all the Bitcoin and all the wallets […] It’s going to get re-encrypted if the holders of the private keys are alive and if they like money,” he said. “If they’re dead, they’re not going to re-encrypt. And if they’ve lost the keys, they’re not going to re-encrypt.” Bitcoin Supply Shock Imminent That is where the “deflationary event” language enters: the upgrade, in his view, would effectively separate recoverable BTC from unrecoverable BTC in a way the market would have to price. “This is going to be a massive upgrade to network security and it’s going to be a massive deflationary event,” Saylor said. “And we’re going to get the answer to the age old question, how much BTC has been lost ?” Saylor also addressed the common objection that decentralization makes coordinated upgrades impractical. He argued the opposite: decentralized networks still converge when sufficiently motivated, and global supply chains and defense ecosystems coordinate under pressure despite being fragmented across thousands of entities. “You think you’re not going to get consensus? All the smart people with money in the world that thought it was smart to put their money on the crypto network, you think they’re the people too stupid to want to upgrade?” he said. In his framing, the practical difference versus a bank-driven migration is timing. A centralized institution can enforce a short deadline; Bitcoin, because it is global and permissionless, would likely take longer , on the order of months to years, but would still converge. “We’re probably going to do this over the course of 30 days or 90 days. It’ll probably take two years or one year,” Saylor said.

Not so fast, says a legendary trader. Veteran analyst Peter Brandt delivers a sobering reality check, predicting the much-anticipated CLARITY Act will have a surprisingly minimal impact on the Bitcoin price . Let’s unpack his seasoned perspective and what it means for your portfolio. What Did Peter Brandt Actually Say About the Bitcoin Price? In a recent interview, Peter Brandt cut through the hype. He stated that while the proposed U.S. crypto market structure bill is a positive step for regulatory clarity, it is not a fundamental event that will redefine Bitcoin’s core value proposition. Brandt, known for his decades of market experience, views the legislation as necessary housekeeping rather than a revolutionary catalyst. His key takeaway is straightforward: don’t expect a regulatory green light to automatically trigger a massive bull run. The Bitcoin price is driven by a more complex set of factors, including adoption, macroeconomic conditions, and its inherent scarcity. Why Won’t Regulatory Clarity Skyrocket the Market? This perspective might surprise investors who have longed for clear rules. However, Brandt’s reasoning is logical. Here are the core reasons a bill might not move the needle significantly: Bitcoin is Global: The Bitcoin price is set on a global stage. While US regulation is important, it’s just one piece of a worldwide puzzle. It’s About Adoption, Not Just Permission: Clear rules help institutions feel comfortable entering. But the real price driver is actual adoption and use, not just the potential for it. The “Sell the News” Risk: Major events are often anticipated and priced in by the market long before they happen. The actual passage could be a classic “sell the news” moment. Therefore, Brandt suggests the bill’s passage might only slightly soften bearish sentiment rather than ignite a full-blown rally. Connecting the Dots: Brandt’s Previous Bitcoin Price Forecast This isn’t Brandt’s first cautious outlook. To understand his current stance, we must look at his recent analysis. In October, he made a notable comparison, drawing parallels between Bitcoin’s chart patterns and the soybean market of the 1970s. Based on that historical analogy, he predicted a potential correction for the Bitcoin price down to the $60,000 level. This context is crucial. His view on the crypto bill is filtered through a lens of near-term market caution. He’s analyzing legislation not in a vacuum, but within the framework of existing technical and macroeconomic pressures. Actionable Insights for Crypto Investors So, what should you do with this information? Don’t just listen—act wisely. Manage Expectations: Separate regulatory progress from guaranteed price appreciation. They are related but not the same. Focus on Fundamentals: Continue to evaluate Bitcoin’s long-term fundamentals—network security, hash rate, wallet growth—rather than betting solely on political outcomes. Diversify Your Catalysts: Build an investment thesis that includes multiple potential growth drivers, not just US regulation. This approach helps you build a resilient strategy that isn’t derailed by a single political event, regardless of its outcome. The Final Verdict: A Dose of Market Maturity Peter Brandt’s analysis signals a maturing market. The initial phase of crypto was dominated by wild speculation on rumors. Now, seasoned veterans are applying disciplined, long-term thinking. The message is clear: sustainable growth for the Bitcoin price comes from organic adoption and technological utility, not just regulatory checkboxes. While the CLARITY Act is undeniably important for creating a safer, more structured U.S. market, it is a foundation for the future, not a magic wand for today’s prices. Investors should welcome the clarity but temper their immediate expectations. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What is the CLARITY Act? A1: The CLARITY Act is a proposed U.S. bill aimed at creating a clearer regulatory framework for cryptocurrencies and digital asset markets, defining the roles of agencies like the SEC and CFTC. Q2: Why does Peter Brandt think it won’t affect Bitcoin’s price much? A2: Brandt believes Bitcoin’s value is defined by global adoption and its fundamental properties, not solely by U.S. regulation. He sees the bill as necessary infrastructure, not a primary price catalyst. Q3: Does this mean regulation is unimportant for crypto? A3> Not at all. Regulation is crucial for mainstream institutional adoption and consumer protection. Brandt’s point is that its direct, short-term impact on the Bitcoin price may be overstated by the market. Q4: What factors does Brandt think will drive Bitcoin’s price instead? A4> While not detailed in this interview, Brandt’s historical analysis suggests he focuses heavily on market cycles, technical patterns, macroeconomic trends (like inflation), and global adoption rates. Q5: Should I sell my Bitcoin if the bill passes? A5> Brandt’s analysis is a perspective, not direct financial advice. It suggests not buying solely in anticipation of the bill. Your decision should align with your long-term investment strategy and risk tolerance. Share This Reality Check Did this perspective help you separate hype from reality?

Is the crypto winter finally starting to thaw? A key market thermometer, the Crypto Fear & Greed Index , just inched up four points to a score of 20. This subtle shift offers a glimmer of hope, but the reading firmly remains in the “Extreme Fear” zone. For investors navigating these volatile waters, understanding this index is not just helpful—it’s essential for making informed decisions. What Exactly Is the Crypto Fear & Greed Index? Think of the Crypto Fear & Greed Index as the market’s emotional heartbeat. Created by data provider Alternative.me, it quantifies the overall sentiment driving cryptocurrency prices on a scale from 0 to 100. A score of 0 represents “Extreme Fear,” while 100 signals “Extreme Greed.” The current reading of 20, though improved, clearly shows that anxiety still dominates the landscape. This isn’t a simple guess. The index uses a sophisticated blend of data sources to gauge the market’s pulse: Volatility (25%): High price swings often correlate with fear. Market Volume (25%): Spikes in trading can indicate momentum shifts. Social Media (15%): The buzz and tone on platforms like Twitter and Reddit. Surveys (15%): Direct sentiment checks from the community. Bitcoin Dominance (10%): When Bitcoin’s market share grows, it can signal a “flight to safety.” Google Trends (10%): Search volume for terms like “Bitcoin crash.” Why Should You Care About a Score of 20? A move from 16 to 20 on the Crypto Fear & Greed Index might seem small, but in sentiment analysis, direction matters. This uptick suggests that the pervasive doom and gloom may be very slightly receding. Historically, prolonged periods of “Extreme Fear” have often preceded significant market rebounds, as weak hands sell and value investors begin to accumulate. However, caution is paramount. The market remains fragile. This slight improvement could be a temporary respite rather than a definitive trend reversal. Therefore, it’s crucial to view this data as one piece of a larger puzzle, not a standalone buy signal. How Can Traders Use This Information? Savvy market participants watch the Crypto Fear & Greed Index for potential opportunities. Extreme fear can sometimes signal a market bottom, while extreme greed often warns of a top. Here are actionable insights: Contrarian Indicator: When fear is extreme, it may be time to research quality projects for potential long-term entry. Risk Management: A rising index from fear towards neutral could indicate decreasing selling pressure. Avoid Emotional Trading: The index helps you see the crowd’s emotion, allowing you to make more rational decisions. Remember, this tool measures sentiment, not fundamentals. Always combine it with your own research on project viability, technology, and market trends. What’s Next for the Crypto Fear & Greed Index? The road to “Greed” is long. For the Crypto Fear & Greed Index to move significantly higher, we would likely need sustained positive catalysts. These could include clear regulatory progress, strong institutional adoption news, or bullish Bitcoin price action that breaks key resistance levels. Until then, the market mood is likely to remain cautious. Monitoring this index weekly, rather than daily, provides a clearer picture of the underlying sentiment trend, helping you filter out market noise. Conclusion: A Flicker, Not a Flame The recent rise in the Crypto Fear & Greed Index to 20 is a noteworthy, if modest, development. It signals that the overwhelming pessimism might be finding a floor. For investors, this environment demands a balanced approach: cautious optimism paired with rigorous due diligence. The index serves as a valuable compass in the emotional storm of crypto markets, reminding us that the greatest opportunities often arise when fear is at its peak. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q: Where can I check the current Crypto Fear & Greed Index? A: You can find the live index and its historical data on the website of its creator, Alternative.me. Q: Is a score of 20 a good time to buy Bitcoin? A: Not necessarily. While extreme fear can indicate potential buying zones, it is not a timing tool. Always conduct your own analysis and consider your risk tolerance. Q: How often is the index updated? A: The Crypto Fear & Greed Index is typically updated once per day. Q: Does the index apply to altcoins as well as Bitcoin? A> Yes. While Bitcoin dominance is one input, the index is designed to reflect sentiment across the broader cryptocurrency market. Q: Has the index been accurate in the past? A> It has been a reliable gauge of crowd psychology. Major market tops in 2017 and 2021 coincided with “Extreme Greed” readings, while bottoms have often aligned with “Extreme Fear.” Found this breakdown of the Crypto Fear & Greed Index helpful?

The Aster DEX has enjoyed a surge in trading volume thanks to various factors, including the launch of its token in September 2025, the high leverage it offers, and integrated spot/yield strategies. It has emerged as a challenger to top perp DEXs like Hyperliquid, appearing just below Hyperliquid in daily/weekly volume rankings according to data from Defillama. Source: Defillama Aster and Lighter have made significant progress The Aster DEX was endorsed by Changpeng Zhao, and he has publicly disclosed holdings of the token, going as far as shilling its chart. For context, the last time CZ shilled the chart of a token was for BNB when it was sub $50. The Aster token is currently under $1, trading at $0.72, and bull Crypto Twitter bulls claim this is the cheapest it will ever be. However, risks like token unlocks continue to put pressure on the price, and there is a $75 million token unlock happening this week, as reported by Cryptopolitan. Unlike Aster, Lighter has no token yet but was running a points farming campaign until mid-December. The Ethereum L2-based platform has witnessed even more rapid growth compared to Aster and occupies a mid-tier position. According to available data, Lighter currently pulls in a lower volume than Aster and Hyperliquid; however, it has been consistent. That changed briefly in November when it jumped to the top of the perps leaderboard on DefiLlama after raising $68 million in a new funding round led by Peter Thiel’s Founders Fund and Ribbit Capital. The funding round announcement was made just as Lighter pushed to the top of perpetual futures-focused DEXs, outpacing rivals Hyperliquid and Aster. Data from DefiLlama shows that the platform is now the largest decentralized perp exchange by trading volume on the monthly timeframes, with $252 billion in perpetual swaps trading volume, followed by Aster’s $218 billion. Open interest for the DEX has also surged to $1.7 billion, behind Aster’s $2.4 billion and Hyperliquid’s $7 billion. Lighter has made a name for itself as a destination for institutional or smart money flow because of its low latency and gas-efficient order books paired with zk-rollup speed. This means standard accounts on the platform don’t incur taker or maker fees, which allows retail users to trade across all markets without costs. Its points system has also implied there will be an airdrop, which has acted as incentive for traders to use the platform. That could actually backfire as many of those people could simply move on to other platforms after the airdrop, as is often seen. One thing is clear from the metrics – Hyperliquid is the dominant leader in the perps DEX space, as it leads in fundamentals like open interest, TVL, and innovations such as HIP-3 for permissionless listings, HyperEVM and a pending Bitwise ETF filing. It is closely followed by Aster the challenger and Lighter, which is quickly becoming a niche platform with its loyal customer base. Hyperliquid’s success led to new perp DEXs Hyperliquid is the undisputed leader of the perps DEX wars, but it has been losing market share to Aster, Lighter and even EdgeX, the DEX that occupies fourth place on the leaderboard, because of incentives and scalability. Tomas Fanta, principal at crypto investment firm Heartcore, has implied that the launch and success of Hyperliquid is what triggered the competition, causing a “wave of copy-cat perp DEXs” to flood the VC market even though most of them “have zero innovation.” According to Fanta, most pure VC funds — those unable to invest in liquid markets — were sidelined by HYPE’s success, so there is an “opportunity to look for a Hyperliquid contender.” He cautioned, however, that there are no guarantees these attempts succeed, as Hyperliquid’s rise was heavily influenced by its “no-VC” narrative and community reward mechanism. Among the top three, the most likely contender for the top spot in the future is Aster, and it has been marketed as such. However, there has been friction in the Aster community recently with holders complaining of not being rewarded and community members alleging the continuous airdrop campaign is only diluting token value. The biggest issue has become the negative price action, which has persisted in the face of accelerated buybacks, encouraging allegations of the team selling the tokens bought via another wallet. Lighter has also had its own fair share of problems. The platform launched its public mainnet on October 1, after eight months of private beta testing. However, as it launched, it faced a major outage just nine days later during the October 10 market crash, forcing the team to later admit that its systems couldn’t handle the traffic surge and that it would upgrade database capacity. Traders who were affected by the outage, which led to about $50 million in losses, were compensated with “Lighter points” that can be exchanged for a future token airdrop.

DraftKings Predictions is a CFTC regulated platform launched by DraftKings. The platform is available in 38 states and allows trading on sport and financial outcomes. DraftKings launches DraftKings Predictions DraftKings has launched a subsidiary called DraftKings Predictions, directly competing with established prediction platforms like Kalshi and Polymarket in the booming events prediction market. The platform launched in 38 states and competes with existing prediction market platforms like Kalshi and Polymarket. The new platform operates under U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) supervision. DraftKings Prediction s re gistered as a CFTC Introducing Broker and Member of the National Futures Association. The platform intends to initially offer markets in sports and finance before expanding into entertainment and culture categories as the product matures. “DraftKings Predictions is a significant milestone and reflects our ongoing commitment to delivering products that tap into the passion of our customers, ” Co rey Gottlieb, the Chief Product Officer of DraftKings, said . The company plans to take advantage of strategic partnerships with ESPN and NBCUniversal to create what Gottlieb describes as “an authentic, real-time product that moves at the speed of sports.” Sports event contracts are available in states where traditional sports betting remains illegal, including California, Florida, Georgia, and Texas. This is because prediction markets are classified as event contracts under CFTC jurisdiction rather than gambling under state gaming laws. How is DraftKings Predictions different from Kalshi and Polymarket ? Dr aftKings Predictions as at its launch, connects t o CM E Group, one of the world’s largest derivatives exchanges. Kalshi, on the other hand, operates its own CFTC-regulated exchange, and Polymarket operates on blockchain technology, and it became compliant with CFTC registration standards in late 2025. DraftKings Predictions plans to integrate Railbird Technologies Inc. and its subsidiary Railbird Exchange, LLC, which DraftKings recently acquired. This integration is expected to increase the available markets, enable product innovation, and provide economic advantages over time. DraftKings operates sophisticated marketing and analytics systems, has an established customer base of millions of users, and maintains partnerships with major media companies. The company recently implemented a “Responsible Trading program, that allows users to set deposit limits, take cooling-off periods, self-exclude, and access educational materials through the DraftKings Responsible Trading Center within the app. Kalshi became the first prediction market exchange to be regulated by the CFTC in 2021, and gained its popularity through predictions around political events. Polymarket had its time in the spotlight in the 2024 election period, when it capped a period of record activity with accurately predicting President Trump’s victory when most traditional polls had the candidates neck and neck. But it had to weather a few rough months of scaled-up faced regulatory scrutiny for serving U.S. customers without proper registration. DraftKings’ pivot into the prediction markets signals the growing mainstream adoption of such markets, but Kalshi and Polymarket maintain a very healthy lead on many of the new entrants into the sector.

According to Arthur Hayes, co-founder of BitMEX, savvy investors should start to bargain hunt for altcoins right now. While the broader market recovery may be slow, Hayes argues this is precisely the moment for those who understand risk and value to act. Why Does Arthur Hayes Say to Bargain Hunt for Altcoins Now? In a recent essay, Hayes presented a contrarian view. He acknowledges that most altcoins are ailing and a full recovery will take time. However, he stresses that this creates a unique window. Investors skilled in capital preservation and exchange mechanics can find deeply undervalued assets. The key is selective, informed action, not blind speculation. The Macro Trigger: How Federal Policy Could Fuel Recovery Hayes doesn’t base his outlook on hype. He points to a specific macroeconomic catalyst: the U.S. Federal Reserve’s Reserve Management Purchases (RMP). He argues this program is effectively a form of quantitative easing (QE). Once the market fully recognizes this, he believes Bitcoin could see a sharp, significant recovery. A rising Bitcoin tide often lifts the altcoin market, making the current bargain hunt for altcoins a potential pre-emptive move. What Are the Practical Steps to Bargain Hunt? This isn’t a call to buy every cheap coin. Hayes emphasizes a disciplined approach. Here are the core principles for investors looking to bargain hunt for altcoins effectively: Focus on Fundamentals: Look beyond price. Assess the project’s technology, team, tokenomics, and real-world use case. Understand Capital Preservation: Never risk more than you can afford to lose. Position sizing is critical in a volatile market. Master Exchange Mechanics: Know how to navigate liquidity, order books, and potential market manipulations. Be Patient: Recovery is slow. This is an accumulation phase, not a short-term trade. Hayes’s Top Pick: A Closer Look at Ethena (ENA) Hayes puts his money where his mouth is. He specifically named Ethena (ENA) as his most preferred altcoin opportunity. He has personally invested in the project through his family office, Maelstrom. This endorsement highlights his strategy: identifying specific projects with strong potential amidst the broader market weakness. It serves as a case study for how to bargain hunt for altcoins with conviction. Navigating the Challenges of Altcoin Investing This strategy is not without risk. The altcoin market is notoriously volatile and many projects fail. Hayes’s advice is a filter for this noise. The goal isn’t to find the next ‘meme coin’ sensation, but to identify fundamentally sound projects trading at a discount due to overall market sentiment. This disciplined bargain hunt for altcoins separates strategic investors from the crowd. Conclusion: A Strategic Window of Opportunity Arthur Hayes provides a clear, macro-informed thesis. The time to bargain hunt for altcoins is when fear is high and prices are low, not when euphoria returns. By focusing on capital preservation, understanding key market mechanics, and waiting for the macro trigger of Fed policy recognition, investors can position themselves thoughtfully. The recovery may be gradual, but the foundations for the next cycle are being built now by those willing to look closely. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) What does it mean to ‘bargain hunt for altcoins’? It means selectively looking for cryptocurrency projects (other than Bitcoin) that are fundamentally strong but currently trading at prices significantly below their perceived long-term value, often due to negative overall market sentiment. Why is Arthur Hayes bullish now if recovery is slow? Hayes believes the best investment opportunities arise when prices are low and most participants are fearful. A slow recovery allows disciplined investors more time to accumulate quality assets before a potential major upward move. What is the RMP plan Hayes mentions? Reserve Management Purchases (RMP) is a Federal Reserve program. Hayes interprets it as a form of quantitative easing, which increases the money supply and has historically been bullish for hard assets like Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies. Should I just buy any cheap altcoin? Absolutely not. Hayes stresses a selective, research-driven approach. The goal is to find projects with solid fundamentals, not just low prices. Many cheap coins may never recover. What is Ethena (ENA)? Ethena is a specific cryptocurrency project that Hayes has publicly endorsed and invested in. He views it as a prime example of a valuable asset currently available at a bargain price. Is this advice suitable for beginner crypto investors? Hayes’s strategy is geared toward investors who already understand core concepts like capital preservation and exchange mechanics. Beginners should focus on education first before attempting to bargain hunt in volatile markets. Found Arthur Hayes’s strategy for navigating the crypto market insightful?

The Department of War admitted in a fresh report that it’s once again failed to account for what it owns versus what it owes, leaving $4.73 trillion in liabilities towering over its assets. The Pentagon also reiterated that it has pushed its clean audit goal to 2028, when Trump would’ve already been out of office. The largest audit flagged 26 material weaknesses and 2 major deficiencies across financial reporting controls for fiscal year 2025. A material weakness, in government terms, is a giant red flag; proof that errors and misstatements probably won’t be caught in time. And they had 26 of them, meaning there’s no real grip on the Pentagon’s accounting structure. F-35 inventory records not reported The F-35 Joint Strike Fighter program, the Pentagon’s most expensive weapon system, added fuel to the fire. According to the report , the Department failed to include the program’s global spares pool in its financial records. That’s a huge pile of parts, gear, and equipment that nobody properly logged. “Because the DoD is unable to provide or obtain accurate and reliable data to verify the existence, completeness, or value of its Global Spares Pool assets for the Joint Strike Fighter Program, we could not quantify the material misstatement in the DoD’s assets on the Agency-Wide Financial Statements,” the audit document stated. Basically, they don’t know how much of the F-35 stockpile even exists, and even if it does, what it’s worth. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth responded to the report, saying the Pentagon “remains steadfast in its commitment to rigorous annual financial statement audits.” He added that the 2025 audit did show “significant progress,” but the department still has major clean-up to do. The only wins this year? One material weakness was resolved and another one got merged into a broader category. Not a huge turnaround by any means. Jules Hurst, acting comptroller, admitted the department won’t get a clean audit without speeding things up fast. “While we made significant progress in FY 2025, the Department of War will not reach its goal of achieving a clean financial statement audit without a significant acceleration of its efforts,” Hurst wrote in a letter included in the audit. “We will change the trajectory in FY 2026 to rapidly address longstanding issues through a revised strategy and approach.” He added, “The Department of War is committed to resolving its critical issues and achieving an unmodified audit opinion by 2028.” On the same day the audit dropped, the Senate confirmed Michael Powers as the Pentagon’s new comptroller. During his July confirmation hearing, Powers said his team would get to work “within weeks” to figure out clear milestones toward a clean audit, as required under the FY24 National Defense Authorization Act. “The work is underneath: How do we get to a common or a couple of common financial systems,” Powers told lawmakers at the time. All that’s left now is four more audit seasons and trillions of dollars to track. The smartest crypto minds already read our newsletter. Want in?

An analysis of the XRP daily Bollinger Bands suggests the path to recovery is blocked, with a return to that key psychological level looking highly improbable before the year ends. Let’s break down what the charts are telling us and what it means for your portfolio. What Do the XRP Daily Bollinger Bands Reveal? According to a recent report highlighted by U.Today, the XRP daily Bollinger Bands on the XRP/USDT chart are flashing warning signs. The core issue is simple yet significant: the price is consistently trading below the indicator’s middle line. This middle line, typically a 20-period simple moving average, acts as a crucial baseline for momentum. Staying beneath it signals a distinct lack of buying pressure and the capital inflow necessary to fuel a major rally. While it’s premature to declare a full-blown, irreversible downtrend, the current setup heavily discourages optimism for a near-term surge. Why is the $2 Target So Unlikely Right Now? The dream of XRP hitting $2 again in 2024 faces a formidable technical wall. For a true bullish reversal to begin, XRP must first accomplish a critical task: reclaim and hold above the middle line of its daily Bollinger Bands , which currently sits around $0.52. This isn’t just a minor hurdle; it’s the first major step towards changing the narrative. Key Resistance: If the daily trading candle closes below this middle line, the level is expected to transform from a target into a strong zone of technical resistance. This means every attempt to rise could be met with selling pressure. Capital Drought: The analysis points to a fundamental problem—insufficient buying volume. Without a significant influx of capital, XRP lacks the fuel to power through resistance levels and stage a meaningful recovery to higher price points like $2. What Would a Bullish Reversal for XRP Actually Look Like? So, is all hope lost? Not necessarily, but traders need clear signals to shift their perspective. A change in fortune would require a concrete sequence of events on the chart. The most immediate and vital sign would be a strong, high-volume daily close above the Bollinger Bands’ middle line. This action would demonstrate that buyers have finally overwhelmed sellers at this key level, potentially opening the door for a test of the upper band. However, given the current bearish alignment of the XRP daily Bollinger Bands , such a move is not on the immediate horizon and would require a substantial shift in market sentiment. Actionable Insights for XRP Traders and Holders Facing this technical reality, what should you do? First, manage expectations. Banking on a $2 XRP price before year-end based on current chart data is a highly speculative gamble. Second, watch for confirmation. Don’t anticipate the breakout; wait for it to happen. A sustained move above the $0.52 middle line with increasing volume would be the first technical green light. Until then, the bearish trend indicated by the squeezing bands and low position suggests caution is the prudent approach. Consider this a period for observation rather than aggressive accumulation. In summary, the message from the XRP daily Bollinger Bands is clear and cautious. The technical setup severely limits the likelihood of a Cinderella run to $2 in the remaining months of the year. The asset is trapped in a bearish phase, needing to overcome significant resistance just to begin a recovery narrative. For now, the charts advise patience, highlighting the $0.52 level as the most important line in the sand for any future bullish hopes. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q: What are Bollinger Bands, and why are they important for XRP? A: Bollinger Bands are a technical analysis tool that plots volatility bands above and below a moving average. For XRP, they help visualize volatility and identify potential overbought or oversold conditions, with the middle line acting as a key momentum indicator. Q: Does the bearish signal from the daily Bollinger Bands mean XRP will keep falling? A> Not necessarily. It indicates a high probability of continued bearish pressure or consolidation in the near term. It is a warning sign, not a guaranteed prediction of future price. Q: What price does XRP need to break to change this bearish outlook? A> The primary level to watch is the middle line of the daily Bollinger Bands, currently around $0.52. A decisive, high-volume close above this level is the first technical requirement for a potential trend change. Q: Should I sell my XRP based on this analysis? A> This is not financial advice. Technical analysis is one of many tools. This analysis suggests managing expectations for a rapid $2 recovery. Your decision should be based on your own research, investment strategy, and risk tolerance. Q: Can external news change this technical picture for XRP? A> Absolutely. Major news like positive regulatory developments or significant partnership announcements can override technical indicators in the short term by drastically shifting market sentiment and capital flows. Q: How often should I check the XRP daily Bollinger Bands? A> For swing or position traders, checking the daily chart at the close of the trading day is sufficient. The daily timeframe filters out market noise and provides a clearer picture of the prevailing trend. Found this breakdown of the XRP daily Bollinger Bands insightful?

That’s the staggering potential outlined by digital asset giant Grayscale. In a recent analysis, the firm stated the tokenized asset market has the runway to grow approximately one thousand times its current size by the end of this decade. This isn’t just speculation; it’s a forecast based on the fundamental digitization of global value. What does this mean for investors and the future of finance? Let’s unpack the data and the driving forces behind this projected seismic shift. What Exactly Is the Tokenized Asset Market Today? To understand the scale of the predicted growth, we must first grasp the starting point. Grayscale notes that tokenized real-world assets (RWAs)—like stocks, bonds, real estate, and commodities represented on a blockchain—currently represent a mere 0.01% of the global stock and bond markets. This minuscule fraction highlights the immense, untapped potential. The current tokenized asset market is a proof-of-concept phase, with pioneering projects demonstrating efficiency and accessibility gains. However, widespread adoption awaits key developments in two critical areas. What Will Fuel This 1,000x Explosion in Growth? Grayscale identifies two primary catalysts for the market’s expansion: mature blockchain infrastructure and clear regulatory frameworks. Think of it as building the highways before the traffic arrives. Infrastructure Maturation: Networks need to handle massive scale, security, and low-cost transactions seamlessly. Regulatory Clarity: Governments must establish rules that protect investors without stifling innovation, giving institutions the confidence to participate. As these pillars solidify, the floodgates could open for trillions in traditional finance value to migrate on-chain. This transition is not about replacing old systems but creating a more efficient, transparent, and accessible layer for global assets. Which Blockchain Networks Will Benefit Most? This historic shift won’t happen in a vacuum. It will drive profound activity across several leading blockchain ecosystems. Grayscale specifically pointed to networks like Ethereum (ETH), BNB Chain (BNB), Solana (SOL), and Avalanche (AVAX) as primary beneficiaries. Each offers unique advantages for tokenization, such as high security, scalability, or specialized subnets. Furthermore, key middleware protocols like Chainlink (LINK), which connect blockchains to real-world data, will become indispensable infrastructure. The growth of the tokenized asset market is, therefore, a rising tide that could lift many boats across the crypto ecosystem. What Are the Real-World Benefits and Hurdles? The promise of tokenization is compelling, but the path has obstacles. On the benefit side, tokenization can: Increase Liquidity: Make traditionally illiquid assets like real estate or fine art easier to buy and sell in fractions. Reduce Costs: Automate processes through smart contracts, cutting out intermediaries. Enhance Transparency: Provide a clear, immutable record of ownership and transaction history. However, significant challenges remain. These include navigating a complex global regulatory patchwork, ensuring robust cybersecurity, and achieving seamless integration with legacy financial systems. Overcoming these hurdles is crucial for the tokenized asset market to reach its forecasted potential. Conclusion: A New Financial Era on the Horizon Grayscale’s 1,000x growth projection for the tokenized asset market is more than a bold number—it’s a vision for a fundamentally upgraded financial system. While the timeline to 2030 is ambitious, the direction is clear. The convergence of technological readiness and regulatory evolution is setting the stage for the largest migration of value in history onto blockchain rails. For forward-looking investors and builders, understanding this megatrend is no longer optional; it’s essential to navigating the next decade of digital finance. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) What does ‘tokenized asset’ mean? A tokenized asset is a real-world item like a share of stock, a bond, or a piece of property that has been digitally represented on a blockchain. This digital token acts as a proof of ownership and can be traded or divided. Why does Grayscale think the market can grow 1,000x? The prediction is based on the current tiny market size (0.01% of traditional markets) and the expectation that blockchain technology will mature and regulations will become clearer, unlocking massive institutional and mainstream adoption. Is my investment safe in tokenized assets? Like any emerging technology, risks exist, including regulatory uncertainty and technical vulnerabilities. Safety will increase as the infrastructure matures and comprehensive regulations are established. Always conduct thorough research. Which assets are most likely to be tokenized first? We are already seeing tokenization of treasury bonds, real estate funds, and private equity. Highly regulated, liquid assets like government bonds and blue-chip stocks are likely candidates for early large-scale adoption. How can an average person invest in this trend? Currently, access is often through specialized platforms or crypto exchanges offering tokenized products. As the market grows, more traditional investment avenues like ETFs may provide exposure. Consulting a financial advisor familiar with digital assets is recommended. Did this analysis of the future tokenized asset market help you see the bigger picture?

Shiba Inu is again making headlines after a decline, although recent figures seem to indicate stabilization and not a crash. On the other hand, capital flows are rotating towards projects at an early stage where pricing asymmetry is common. Such an aspect has brought attention towards the best crypto to buy now as investors rethink the best crypto to invest in when faced with such a condition. In this line, a presale crypto at $0.035 has received significant attention as the best crypto to buy now. Shiba Inu Stabilization After Panic Selling Current market trends illustrate Shiba Inu is currently close to a local floor after enduring an extended period of decline. While sales continue, they are not as aggressive, with price compression instead of the initial steep fall. It is essential to note that market information illustrates SHIB has not eroded its liquidity, as it is still being traded on prominent platforms with adequate volumes. There has been purchasing traction at the current price levels, making adverse acceleration less probable. While there is little impetus on the upside, this positive sentiment has eased panicky selling pressures. As such, investors are currently reassessing the new cryptos to buy, including those beyond Shiba Inu, chiefly in search of optimal growth asymmetry. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Presale Continues The focus is also on Mutuum Finance (MUTM) , where the presale is now at a critical level. Phase 6 is about 98% full, and sales are happening fast as there is a sense of urgency. The price for the ongoing Phase 6 is $0.035, indicating a price jump of 250%, or 3.5 times, the price seen during Phase 1, where it was priced at $0.01. Overall, since the presale started, a sum of $19,500,000 has been accumulated, and there are also a cumulative 18,530 MUTM holders. Phase 6 is selling out fast, and the opportunity for purchases at this price is limited. Phase 7 will be live immediately after sell-out, marking a forthcoming price rise by about a near 20% price rise to $0.04, along with a launch price set at $0.06. Based on expectations, purchasers are set to see a 420% ROI. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) – Utility and Development Project updates continue to instill continued confidence in Mutuum Finance (MUTM). The team announced the launch of V1 protocol, which will go live on the Sepolia testnet in Q4 2025, with the focus finalized on liquidity pools, mtTokens, debt tokens, and the liquidator bot, with the supported assets to be ETH and USDT. Security continues to be top of the agenda, with an independent security audit currently in progress, and Mutuum’s lending and borrowing contracts currently under review by Halborn Security. The code lock ensures a lower risk of execution while the initial users take the first steps to explore the best cryptocurrency to invest in now. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Engagement & Incentive Structure Community engagement has driven presale momentum thus far. A recently integrated tool offers a real-time leaderboard displaying the top 50 holders. The 24-Hour Leaderboard offers rewards for engagement, awarding the #1 ranked user a $500 MUTM reward each day they make a transaction. The leaderboard renews each day at 00:00 UTC, keeping the competitive spirit alive. As a further promotion, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is holding a $100,000 giveaway, awarding ten lucky winners a prize of $10,000 in MUTM, keeping the awareness active in the presale phase, while investors consider it as the best cryptocurrency to invest in now relative to the slow-moving giants in the market. The market behavior is also a timely reminder that timing is everything. Shiba Inu has stabilized, but its potential for growth is limited compared to the early DeFi exposure of MUTM. Alternatives exist in terms of MUTM, which is almost sold out in Phase 6 and is therefore the last chance to buy at $0.035 before the price increment. Investors considering what crypto to buy now are looking at areas of convergence when it comes to price, progress, and rewards. This is definitely an opportunity that aligns perfectly.

Bitcoin remains capped below the $90,000 level, repeatedly failing to attract enough demand to flip resistance into support. At the same time, Ethereum is experiencing heightened volatility and renewed selling pressure, reflecting broader risk aversion across the market. Sentiment has weakened, and price action suggests that investors are becoming increasingly selective rather than aggressively positioning for upside. However, according to an analysis by XWIN Research Japan, the most important shift currently unfolding in crypto is not visible directly in price charts but in how and where capital is being positioned. On-chain data shows that global liquidity within the crypto ecosystem has not exited the market. Instead, it has changed form. The total supply of ERC20-based stablecoins has expanded to approximately $160 billion, hovering near all-time highs. While this supply briefly contracted during the risk-off environment of 2022, it has since resumed a clear and sustained upward trend. This behavior does not signal capital fleeing crypto. Rather, it reflects funds temporarily de-risking while remaining fully inside the ecosystem. Capital is accumulating in stablecoins as “waiting liquidity,” positioned on the sidelines and ready to be deployed once clearer directional signals emerge. Liquidity has not disappeared; it is simply paused, patient, and awaiting conviction. Japan’s Strategic Position in the Global Capital Shift The analysis also highlights that this shift in global capital behavior carries meaningful implications for Japan’s crypto market. As regulatory clarity improves and tax frameworks gradually become more accommodating, Japan is positioned to benefit from a return of domestic capital that has remained cautious in recent years. Combined with renewed interest from individual investors, this re-entry of sidelined capital could deepen local liquidity, improve price discovery, and strengthen Japan’s role within the broader global crypto landscape. A key element in this transition is the growing relevance of JPYC, Japan’s yen-denominated stablecoin. While US dollar–based stablecoins continue to dominate global crypto flows, a yen-native digital currency offers Japan a strategic differentiator. JPYC is not limited to speculative trading use cases; it is increasingly viewed as an infrastructure layer capable of supporting real economic activity. This includes integration with Web3 services, as well as domestic and cross-border payment applications that align more closely with Japan’s existing financial systems. Looking ahead, the report suggests Japan’s crypto market may gradually shift away from a narrow focus on short-term price speculation. Instead, it could evolve into an ecosystem where capital actively circulates and is deployed for practical use cases. Ultimately, how effectively Japan absorbs and channels this globally mobile liquidity will play a central role in defining the market’s next phase of growth. Crypto Market Tests Structural Support Amid Broad Risk-Off Sentiment The total cryptocurrency market capitalization is showing clear signs of structural stress after failing to sustain momentum above recent highs. As the weekly chart highlights, total market cap has retraced toward the $2.9–$3.0 trillion zone, an area that now acts as a critical inflection point for the broader market. This level coincides with the rising 100-week and 200-week moving averages, reinforcing its importance as medium- to long-term support. The rejection from the $4 trillion region marks a decisive shift in market structure. After an extended expansion phase through 2024 and early 2025, the market has entered a corrective regime characterized by lower highs and weakening upside follow-through. Volume behavior supports this interpretation: selling pressure has increased during down weeks, while rebound attempts have been met with comparatively muted participation. Despite the pullback, the long-term trend has not fully broken. The market remains well above the 2022–2023 base, suggesting this move resembles a consolidation or valuation reset rather than a full structural collapse. However, continued trading below the short-term moving averages indicates that risk appetite remains subdued. For the bullish structure to reassert itself, the total market cap must stabilize above the $3 trillion threshold and reclaim the mid-range resistance near $3.3–$3.5 trillion. Failure to hold current support would expose the market to a deeper retracement toward the $2.4–$2.6 trillion region, where stronger historical demand previously emerged.

According to Galaxy Digital’s research team, the answer might be a resounding yes. Their latest forecast suggests we could witness a new Bitcoin all-time high as soon as 2025, with even more ambitious targets on the horizon. This analysis comes from one of the most respected institutional voices in digital assets, making it particularly noteworthy for investors and enthusiasts alike. What’s Driving the Optimism for a Bitcoin All-Time High? Galaxy Research, the analytical division of Galaxy Digital, recently released their annual prediction report with some eye-catching projections. They maintain that despite market uncertainties, the potential for Bitcoin to achieve a new all-time high next year remains valid. This isn’t just casual speculation—it’s a carefully considered outlook from professionals who analyze cryptocurrency markets daily. The report specifically mentions Bitcoin could reach $250,000 by the end of 2027. While they acknowledge the inherent uncertainty in such long-term predictions, their confidence stems from several fundamental factors: Institutional adoption continuing to accelerate Bitcoin’s fixed supply becoming more relevant as adoption grows Macroeconomic conditions that historically favor hard assets Technological improvements to Bitcoin’s ecosystem How Realistic Are These Bitcoin Price Predictions? When any firm predicts a new Bitcoin all-time high, experienced investors naturally question the methodology. Galaxy Digital’s analysis appears grounded in both technical and fundamental approaches. They’re not simply extrapolating past performance but considering how Bitcoin’s role in the global financial system is evolving. What makes this forecast particularly interesting is the timing. A 2025 Bitcoin all-time high would represent a significant acceleration from previous market cycles. However, Galaxy Research suggests that several converging factors could make this timeline plausible, including regulatory clarity and broader acceptance of Bitcoin as a legitimate asset class. The Stablecoin Revolution: Another Key Insight Beyond Bitcoin predictions, Galaxy’s report contains another crucial revelation about stablecoins. They project that stablecoin transaction volume will surpass that of the U.S. Automated Clearing House (ACH) system by 2026. This isn’t a distant possibility—stablecoin volume has already exceeded major credit card networks like Visa and currently sits at half the level of ACH transactions. This growth trajectory matters because: It demonstrates real-world cryptocurrency adoption beyond speculation Stablecoins are becoming critical infrastructure for global payments The upcoming Genius Act implementation in early 2026 will likely accelerate adoption What This Means for Crypto Investors If Galaxy Digital’s predictions prove accurate, we’re entering a transformative period for digital assets. A new Bitcoin all-time high in 2025 would represent more than just price appreciation—it would signal mainstream validation of cryptocurrency’s role in modern finance. For investors, this underscores the importance of maintaining a long-term perspective rather than reacting to short-term volatility. However, it’s crucial to remember that all predictions involve uncertainty. While Galaxy Digital’s analysis is respected, market conditions can change rapidly. The key takeaway isn’t the specific price target but the underlying thesis: institutional analysts see strong fundamentals supporting continued Bitcoin growth. Conclusion: A Bullish Vision for Bitcoin’s Future Galaxy Digital’s forecast paints an optimistic picture for Bitcoin’s trajectory toward a new all-time high. Their dual focus on Bitcoin’s price potential and stablecoin adoption growth provides a comprehensive view of where digital assets might be heading. While predictions should always be approached with measured optimism, this analysis from a major institutional player offers valuable perspective for anyone interested in cryptocurrency’s future. The possibility of witnessing a Bitcoin all-time high in 2025, followed by continued growth toward $250,000, represents one of the more bullish institutional outlooks currently available. Combined with the projected explosion in stablecoin usage, we may be witnessing the early stages of cryptocurrency’s transition from alternative asset to financial mainstream. Frequently Asked Questions What exactly is Galaxy Digital predicting for Bitcoin? Galaxy Digital’s research arm forecasts that Bitcoin could reach a new all-time high in 2025, with a potential price target of $250,000 by the end of 2027. How reliable are these cryptocurrency predictions? While Galaxy Digital is a respected institutional voice, all market predictions involve uncertainty. Their analysis is based on current data and trends, but investors should consider multiple perspectives. What are stablecoins and why do they matter? Stablecoins are cryptocurrencies pegged to stable assets like the US dollar. Galaxy predicts their transaction volume will surpass the entire US ACH system by 2026, indicating massive adoption. Should I invest based on this prediction? Investment decisions should be based on your individual financial situation, risk tolerance, and research. Predictions from analysts can inform your research but shouldn’t be the sole basis for investment choices. What is the Genius Act mentioned in the report? The Genius Act is upcoming legislation expected to provide clearer regulatory frameworks for stablecoins, potentially accelerating their adoption when implemented in early 2026. How does this prediction compare to previous Bitcoin cycles? A 2025 all-time high would represent an accelerated timeline compared to some previous cycles, suggesting potentially different market dynamics are at play. Found this analysis insightful?

Brandt’s technical analysis focused squarely on chart behavior rather than sentiment, warning that the current setup carries downside implications that traders cannot ignore and must deal with. Peter Brandt Calls Out A Potential Double Top Taking to the social media platform X, Brandt highlighted what he described as a potential double top forming on XRP’s weekly chart. He acknowledged upfront that the pattern could still fail but stressed that, as things stand, the structure leans bearish. Related Reading: Analyst Says This XRP Level Is Keeping Downside Pressure In Check The analysis is based on XRP’s recent price action, which has lost the $2 price level after days of consistent bearish price action in December. Brandt framed the setup as a matter of accepting what the chart is showing rather than arguing against it, bluntly stating that market participants need to deal with the implications instead of dismissing them. His remarks were also directed at persistent XRP optimists, making it clear that his stance is not driven by bias against the asset but by adherence to classical chart principles. Until price action invalidates the pattern, the risk profile is tilted to the downside, and XRP might continue pushing downwards in the near term. “Love it or not — you need to deal with it,” Brandt said. The chart accompanying Brandt’s post shows XRP falling below the support of a flag pattern a few months ago. This breakdown has continued to the lower boundary around $1.80 to $2.00, which has acted as an important support pair against a resistance around $3.5. This support level has acted as a critical support region two times already this year. However, XRP looks like it might be losing this level now at the third time of asking. The weekly moving averages on the chart also appear to be flattening, a sign that upside strength has weakened compared to earlier phases of the cycle. What Would Change The Bearish Outlook A double top pattern is a bearish reversal signal, meaning an uptrend is likely ending and a downtrend is beginning. However, despite his firm tone, Brandt was careful to note that the pattern is conditional, not absolute. “This is a potential double top. Sure, it may fail, and I will deal with this if it does,” he said. Related Reading: XRP Price Falls To Critical Support Level, Is It Time To Panic? A sustained move back above the support at $2 would delay any breakdown into the $1 range. A further sustained reclaim of highs around $2.2, $2.5, $2.7, and $3 would invalidate the double top and force a reassessment of the broader trend. However, until such happens, Brandt’s technical structure continues to favor caution that many XRP proponents might not agree with.

Despite high expectations for institutional adoption, crypto hedge funds are posting their worst performance since the 2022 bear market, according to Bloomberg analysis. This unexpected downturn challenges the narrative that clearer regulations and White House policies would guarantee success. Why Are Crypto Hedge Funds Struggling in 2024? The data reveals a sobering picture. Directional trading funds focused on predicting market movements have recorded negative 2.5% returns year-to-date. This represents their poorest performance since the depths of the crypto winter. The situation appears even more challenging for altcoin-focused strategies, which have suffered approximately negative 23% returns. Several factors contribute to this underperformance: Increased institutional competition weakening traditional advantages The October 10th market drop exposing structural vulnerabilities Changing market dynamics that favor different investment approaches Which Investment Strategies Are Actually Working? While directional funds struggle, market-neutral approaches tell a different story. These strategies have achieved impressive returns of around 14.4% year-to-date. The divergence highlights how 2024’s market conditions reward specific approaches while punishing others. Market-neutral funds typically employ strategies like: Arbitrage between different exchanges Statistical pairs trading Delta-neutral options strategies This performance gap suggests that simple directional bets on cryptocurrency prices no longer guarantee success, even for professional crypto hedge funds . How Are Hedge Funds Adapting to Market Challenges? In response to these challenges, many funds are implementing significant strategic shifts. Risk management has become the priority, with managers reducing exposure to volatile altcoins. Instead, they’re strengthening their focus on more predictable opportunities. The current adaptation strategies include: Reduced altcoin exposure to minimize volatility risk Increased DeFi focus for yield-generating opportunities Enhanced risk frameworks to withstand market shocks Diversification across different cryptocurrency strategies These changes reflect a maturation in how crypto hedge funds approach the market, moving from speculative trading toward more sustainable investment practices. What Does This Mean for the Future of Crypto Investing? The current performance data signals an important evolution in cryptocurrency markets. The influx of institutional capital has fundamentally changed the competitive landscape. Traditional hedge fund advantages are diminishing as more sophisticated players enter the space. This development suggests several future trends: Continued pressure on simple directional strategies Growth in sophisticated, quantitative approaches Increased importance of risk management frameworks Greater focus on sustainable yield generation The struggle of crypto hedge funds in 2024 serves as a valuable lesson for all cryptocurrency investors. It demonstrates that professional management doesn’t guarantee success in volatile markets. The data clearly shows that strategy selection and risk management matter more than ever. Frequently Asked Questions What exactly are crypto hedge funds? Crypto hedge funds are investment funds that pool capital from accredited investors to trade cryptocurrencies using various strategies. They aim to generate returns regardless of market direction through sophisticated trading approaches. Why are directional trading strategies underperforming? Directional strategies rely on correctly predicting market movements. Increased institutional participation and changing market dynamics have made price prediction more challenging, reducing the effectiveness of these approaches. What makes market-neutral strategies successful? Market-neutral strategies profit from relative price movements between assets rather than overall market direction. This approach can generate returns in both rising and falling markets, providing more consistent performance. How are hedge funds changing their altcoin exposure? Many funds are reducing their altcoin allocations due to high volatility and concentrating on more established cryptocurrencies. They’re also implementing stricter risk controls for any remaining altcoin positions. Will this trend continue throughout 2024? While current conditions favor market-neutral approaches, cryptocurrency markets remain dynamic. Successful crypto hedge funds will likely continue adapting their strategies based on evolving market conditions. What should individual investors learn from this? Individual investors should recognize that professional management doesn’t eliminate risk. Diversification, risk management, and understanding different strategy types remain crucial for success in cryptocurrency investing. Found this analysis of crypto hedge funds insightful?

The startup, founded by former Splunk executives, is pioneering autonomous site reliability engineering technology that could revolutionize how companies maintain their software systems. This funding milestone represents one of the most significant AI infrastructure investments of the year. Resolve AI’s Revolutionary Approach to System Maintenance Resolve AI is developing what they call an “autonomous SRE” – a tool that automatically maintains software systems without human intervention. While traditional site reliability engineers manually troubleshoot and resolve system failures, Resolve AI’s technology autonomously identifies, diagnoses, and resolves production issues in real-time. This addresses a critical challenge for modern companies: as software systems become more complex and distributed across cloud infrastructure, organizations struggle to find and retain enough skilled SREs to keep systems running smoothly. The Series A Funding That’s Making Waves The Series A round was led by Lightspeed Venture Partners, according to sources familiar with the deal. What makes this funding particularly interesting is its structure: while the headline valuation stands at $1 billion, the company’s actual blended valuation was lower due to a multi-tranched investment approach. In this setup, investors purchased some equity at the $1 billion valuation but acquired the remainder – likely a larger percentage of the round – at a lower price. This novel investment structure has recently become popular for the most sought-after AI startups. Resolve AI Funding Timeline Funding Round Amount Lead Investor Notable Participants Timing Seed Round $35 million Greylock Fei-Fei Li, Jeff Dean October 2023 Series A Undisclosed Lightspeed Venture Partners Multiple investors Current Why Autonomous SRE Technology Matters Now The timing for Resolve AI’s technology couldn’t be better. Companies face several critical challenges that autonomous SRE solutions address: Skills Shortage: There’s a severe shortage of qualified SRE professionals in the market System Complexity: Modern software architectures are becoming increasingly distributed and complex Cost Pressure: Manual system maintenance is expensive and inefficient Dowtime Costs: System failures can cost companies millions in lost revenue The Visionary Founders Behind Resolve AI The startup is led by former Splunk executive Spiros Xanthos and Mayank Agarwal, Splunk’s former chief architect for observability. Their partnership dates back 20 years to their graduate studies at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign. This isn’t their first successful collaboration – they previously co-founded Omnition, a startup that was acquired by Splunk in 2019. Their deep experience in observability and system monitoring gives them unique insights into the problems Resolve AI aims to solve. How Does Resolve AI Compare to Competitors? Resolve AI isn’t alone in the autonomous SRE space. The startup competes with Traversal, another AI SRE startup that recently raised a $48 million Series A led by Kleiner Perkins with participation from Sequoia. However, Resolve AI’s approach appears to be gaining significant traction, as evidenced by their impressive Series A valuation and backing from top-tier investors like Lightspeed Venture Partners. The Business Metrics Behind the Billion-Dollar Valuation According to sources, Resolve AI’s annual recurring revenue (ARR) is approximately $4 million. While this might seem modest compared to the $1 billion valuation, investors are clearly betting on the company’s growth potential and the massive market opportunity for autonomous SRE solutions. The exact size of the Series A funding round couldn’t be learned, but it’s clearly substantial enough to warrant the attention it’s receiving. What This Means for the Future of System Reliability The success of Resolve AI’s Series A funding signals a major shift in how companies approach system maintenance. As AI continues to advance, we can expect to see more automation in areas traditionally handled by human experts. The benefits of autonomous SRE technology are compelling: Reduced Downtime: Automated systems can respond to issues faster than humans Lower Operational Costs: Automation reduces the need for large SRE teams Increased Engineering Productivity: Teams can focus on building new features rather than firefighting 24/7 Coverage: AI systems don’t need sleep or breaks Frequently Asked Questions Who are the founders of Resolve AI? Resolve AI was founded by former Splunk executives Spiros Xanthos and Mayank Agarwal. Their partnership dates back to their graduate studies at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign. What investors are backing Resolve AI? The Series A round was led by Lightspeed Venture Partners . Previous investors include Greylock , with participation from Fei-Fei Li and Jeff Dean from Google DeepMind. How does Resolve AI’s technology work? Resolve AI develops autonomous site reliability engineering tools that automatically identify, diagnose, and resolve production issues in real-time, reducing the need for manual intervention by human SREs. What is the company’s current valuation? Resolve AI has achieved a headline valuation of $1 billion with its Series A funding, though the actual blended valuation is lower due to the multi-tranched investment structure. Who are Resolve AI’s main competitors? The main competitor is Traversal, another AI SRE startup that recently raised $48 million in Series A funding led by Kleiner Perkins . The Transformative Potential of Autonomous SRE Resolve AI’s $1 billion Series A valuation represents more than just another funding milestone – it signals a fundamental shift in how we think about system reliability. As software continues to eat the world, the systems that power our digital infrastructure are becoming too complex for humans to manage alone. Autonomous SRE technology offers a compelling solution to this growing challenge, promising to make our digital infrastructure more resilient, efficient, and cost-effective. The backing from Lightspeed Venture Partners and other top investors validates not just Resolve AI’s approach, but the entire category of autonomous system management. As companies continue to struggle with system complexity and talent shortages, solutions like Resolve AI’s will become increasingly essential. This funding round positions the company at the forefront of what could become one of the most important technology trends of the coming decade.

The exchange says those matters should be regulated by the federal Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), not by state gaming authorities. According to Coinbase, prediction market contracts are derivatives that fall under the Commodity Exchange Act, and Congress gave the CFTC the power to police those markets. The company is seeking declaratory and injunctive relief to prevent what it calls a patchwork of state rules that could bar federally approved products from reaching consumers. Paul Grewal, Coinbase’s chief legal officer, has pushed that argument publicly. Today @coinbase filed lawsuits in CT, MI, and IL to confirm what is clear: prediction markets fall squarely under the jurisdiction of the @CFTC , not any individual state gaming regulator (let alone 50). State efforts to control or outright block these markets stifle innovation… — paulgrewal.eth (@iampaulgrewal) December 19, 2025 Why States Stepped In Reports have disclosed that some states have already acted. Connecticut’s regulators issued cease-and-desist orders to platforms such as Kalshi, Robinhood, and Crypto.com, saying certain event contracts look like unlicensed sports betting under state law. Those actions helped trigger the wider legal fight as firms say they operate under federal rules. Coinbase is not only arguing in court. The exchange plans to offer event-contract trading to US users through a partnership with Kalshi, a CFTC-regulated platform, with a rollout targeted for January 2026. That timetable is one reason Coinbase says it needs a clear federal ruling now, to avoid being blocked in some states after launching. Market Reaction And Context The move comes amid a broader tug-of-war over whether prediction markets are financial products or gambling. Kalshi has faced similar fights in several states, and courts have issued mixed rulings so far. Market watchers say the outcome here could decide whether federally approved event contracts are available nationwide or must be treated state-by-state. The litigation also landed in investors’ view. Coinbase’s shares fell more than 10% at one point on the same day the suits were filed, though trading moves were also tied to wider swings in crypto prices. Reports link the stock change to both the news and underlying market trends. If federal judges back Coinbase, the ruling could reinforce CFTC authority and make it easier for platforms regulated at the federal level to operate across state lines. If judges side with the states, companies may face licensing needs in multiple places or be forced to restrict certain contracts in some jurisdictions.

Ethereum Exchange Netflow Has Been Red For The Past Week As pointed out by institutional DeFi solutions provider Sentora in a new post on X, Ethereum has seen net outflows from exchanges in the past week. The indicator of relevance here is the “Exchange Netflow,” which measures the net amount of ETH that’s moving into or out of wallets connected with centralized exchanges. When the value of this metric is positive, it means the investors are depositing a net number of tokens to these platforms. As one of the main reasons why holders deposit their coins to exchanges is for selling-related purposes, this kind of trend can be bearish for the asset’s price. Related Reading: Bitcoin & Ethereum Diverge: Longs Dominate BTC, While ETH Shorts Rise On the other hand, the indicator being below zero suggests outflows are dominating the inflows on exchanges. Such a trend can be a sign that investors are in a phase of accumulation, which can naturally be bullish for the cryptocurrency. As the data shared by Sentora shows, Ethereum has seen a weekly Exchange Netflow value of -$978.45 million, indicating that traders have made a massive amount of net withdrawals. The significant outflows have come as Ethereum has witnessed a decline during the past week. As Sentora explains: This signals aggressive accumulation where investors are likely “buying the dip” and withdrawing assets to cold storage or on-chain environments, tightening the liquid supply despite the negative price momentum. Related Reading: Ethereum Risks Slide To $2,000 If December Closes Below This Level: Analyst The price drawdown in the past week has also accompanied a drop in the total transaction fees on the network, meaning that transfer activity has gone down. The blockchain saw about $2.64 million in fees over the last week, which is more than 15% down week-over-week. ETH Saw A Brief Visit Under $2,800 Before Rebounding Ethereum observed a decline to $2,780 on Thursday, but the asset was able to bounce back as it’s now floating just under $3,000. Interestingly, ETH’s bottom was around the same level as a major on-chain supply cluster, as a chart shared by analyst Ali Martinez in an X post shows. In the graph, Martinez has attached the data of the Ethereum UTXO Realized Price Distribution (URPD) from on-chain analytics firm Glassnode. This metric basically tells us how much ETH supply was last transacted at the various price levels that the coin has visited in its history. There is a huge supply zone located at $2,772 on the URPD, suggesting a large amount of investors have their cost basis at it. Generally, such levels act as a support boundary during downtrends, as traders who purchased there buy the dip to defend it.

This massive movement of 2,509 BTC over just 13 hours has sent ripples through the cryptocurrency community, sparking intense speculation about what it means for Bitcoin’s future price action. What Does This Massive Bitcoin Whale Activity Reveal? On-chain analyst EmberCN first spotted this extraordinary transaction pattern. Three separate wallets, each withdrawing exactly 836.4 BTC (worth approximately $73.58 million), executed their moves in precise four-hour intervals. This clockwork precision strongly suggests a single entity controls all three wallets, making this one of the most significant coordinated Bitcoin whale movements recently observed. The timing of these withdrawals is particularly intriguing. They occurred during what many consider a price dip period for Bitcoin. Therefore, this activity could signal that deep-pocketed investors or institutions have begun accumulating Bitcoin at what they perceive as attractive prices. When a Bitcoin whale makes moves of this magnitude, the entire market pays attention. Why Should Crypto Investors Care About Whale Movements? Whale transactions serve as crucial market indicators for several reasons. First, they represent substantial capital flows that can influence market sentiment and liquidity. Second, the patterns often reveal institutional strategies before they become apparent through traditional channels. Market Sentiment Gauge : Large accumulations during dips typically signal confidence in future price appreciation Liquidity Impact : Removing $221 million worth of Bitcoin from an exchange reduces immediate selling pressure Strategic Timing : The coordinated, timed withdrawals suggest a deliberate accumulation strategy Institutional Patterns Identical transaction amounts and intervals mirror institutional rather than retail behavior This particular Bitcoin whale activity stands out because of its scale and methodology. The withdrawal of such a substantial amount from a single exchange in such a short timeframe is unusual, even for the cryptocurrency’s largest players. How Do Whale Movements Impact Bitcoin’s Price Trajectory? Historically, significant whale accumulation during market corrections has often preceded substantial price rallies. When large holders remove Bitcoin from exchanges, they effectively reduce the available supply for trading. This scarcity effect, combined with continued demand, creates upward price pressure. However, interpreting whale movements requires caution. While this particular Bitcoin whale activity appears bullish, whales can also trigger market downturns through large sell-offs. The key distinction lies in whether they’re moving assets to cold storage (typically bullish) or between exchanges (potentially bearish). In this case, the withdrawal from FalconX suggests accumulation for holding rather than immediate trading. Market analysts are particularly interested in the FalconX connection. As an institutional-focused platform, FalconX handles substantial volumes for professional investors. A Bitcoin whale moving assets from this specific exchange reinforces the institutional narrative surrounding this transaction. What Can Retail Investors Learn From This Whale Activity? While retail investors cannot match whale-scale transactions, they can learn from their patterns. The disciplined, timed accumulation during price weakness demonstrates a strategy worth noting. Rather than panic selling during dips, this Bitcoin whale is systematically acquiring more assets. Consider these actionable insights from this whale movement: Monitor on-chain data : Tools tracking large transactions provide early signals of market shifts Understand exchange flows : Net withdrawals from major exchanges often precede bullish periods Recognize patterns : Coordinated, identical transactions typically indicate sophisticated players Context matters : Whale activity during price declines carries different implications than during rallies The psychological impact of such visible Bitcoin whale activity cannot be overstated. When large players demonstrate confidence through substantial investments, it often creates a halo effect that boosts overall market sentiment. Conclusion: Decoding the Whale’s Message This $221 million Bitcoin withdrawal represents more than just a large transaction—it’s a potential signal about institutional confidence in Bitcoin’s long-term value proposition. The precise, coordinated nature of the moves suggests sophisticated players are accumulating positions during what they perceive as favorable market conditions. While no single indicator guarantees future price movements, the combination of scale, timing, and pattern makes this whale activity particularly noteworthy. As the cryptocurrency market continues maturing, understanding these large-player movements becomes increasingly crucial for all market participants. The silent message from this Bitcoin whale seems clear: some of the market’s largest players see current levels as accumulation opportunities. Frequently Asked Questions What is a Bitcoin whale? A Bitcoin whale is an individual or entity that holds a sufficiently large amount of Bitcoin to potentially influence market prices through their trading activities. There’s no official threshold, but wallets containing thousands of BTC typically qualify. Why do whales withdraw Bitcoin from exchanges? Whales typically withdraw Bitcoin from exchanges for long-term storage in more secure wallets (cold storage). This reduces their exposure to exchange-related risks and signals an intention to hold rather than trade immediately. How can I track whale movements? Several blockchain analytics platforms like Glassnode, CryptoQuant, and Whale Alert track large transactions. These tools provide real-time alerts about significant movements between wallets and exchanges. Do whale movements always predict price changes? Not always. While large accumulations often precede price increases, correlation doesn’t guarantee causation. Whale movements should be considered alongside other market indicators for more accurate predictions. What’s the difference between whale and institutional activity? While overlapping, “whale” typically refers to any large holder regardless of identity, while “institutional” specifically indicates organizations like hedge funds, corporations, or investment firms. The FalconX withdrawals suggest institutional involvement due to the platform’s focus. How does this affect average Bitcoin investors? Whale activities can influence market sentiment and liquidity, potentially affecting volatility and price trends. However, retail investors should focus on their investment strategies rather than reacting to every whale movement. Found this analysis of Bitcoin whale activity insightful?

According to BitMEX co-founder Arthur Hayes, you might have already missed it. In a recent interview, Hayes delivered a sobering wake-up call to the crypto community, arguing that the season is not coming—it’s already here, and many traders simply failed to recognize it because they were looking for the wrong signs. What Did Arthur Hayes Actually Say About the Altcoin Season? Arthur Hayes, a respected and often provocative voice in crypto, made a clear and direct argument. He stated that traders claiming the altcoin season hasn’t begun are often the ones who did not hold the right assets as their prices surged. His core message challenges a common misconception: the expectation that a market cycle will repeat identically. Hayes insists the market has evolved, entering a new phase where rallies are more selective and nuanced. Why Are So Many Traders Convinced the Altcoin Season Hasn’t Started? This feeling of missing out often stems from outdated benchmarks. Many investors anchor their expectations to previous bull markets, waiting for a broad, simultaneous explosion across all alternative cryptocurrencies. However, the current landscape is different. Capital flows are smarter and more sector-specific. Therefore, if you were only watching Bitcoin or a handful of large-cap tokens, you might have overlooked significant rallies in other areas. Hayes’s point is profound: denial of the season’s existence is frequently just an admission of non-participation. How Has the New Altcoin Season Changed? The dynamics of this altcoin season are distinct. It’s not a uniform tide lifting all boats. Instead, we are seeing rotational surges. Understanding this shift is crucial for future success. Sector-Specific Rallies: Projects in sectors like DeFi, AI, or Real-World Assets (RWA) may pump independently while others remain flat. Reduced Correlation: Altcoins are not moving in perfect lockstep with Bitcoin as they once did, requiring more diligent research. Quality Over Hype: Fundamentals and tokenomics are playing a larger role, separating serious projects from mere memes. What Can You Do If You Missed the First Wave? Feeling like you missed the boat is a common emotion in fast-moving markets, but it’s not a terminal condition. The key is to adapt your strategy for this new environment. First, broaden your perspective beyond the usual suspects. Second, focus on identifying narratives and sectors that are gaining traction but haven’t yet peaked. Finally, practice disciplined entry points; FOMO buying at all-time highs is a recipe for losses. Remember, Hayes isn’t saying the opportunity is over; he’s highlighting that its form has changed. Actionable Insights for Navigating the Current Altcoin Season To position yourself better, consider these steps. Conduct thorough research into emerging crypto sectors. Diversify your watchlist beyond the top 10 by market cap. Most importantly, set clear risk management rules before entering any trade. The market rewards those who are prepared, not just those who are present. In conclusion, Arthur Hayes has issued a vital reality check. The altcoin season is not a spectator event waiting for a starting gun; it is an ongoing process of capital rotation and sectoral growth. Those who adapt to its new rhythm, who research diligently and manage risk wisely, can still find significant opportunities. The season may have started quietly, but for the attentive investor, it is far from over. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q: What exactly is an ‘altcoin season’? A: An ‘altcoin season’ is a period in the cryptocurrency market where alternative cryptocurrencies (altcoins) significantly outperform Bitcoin in terms of price gains. Q: Why does Arthur Hayes say people missed it? A: Hayes argues that because the rallies have been sector-specific and not a broad-based surge across all altcoins, many traders waiting for the latter signal believe it hasn’t started, even though certain assets have already seen massive gains. Q: Is it too late to invest in altcoins now? A> According to the perspective discussed, it is not too late. The season is characterized by rotational rallies, meaning new sectors and projects may see growth as capital moves around the market. Q: How can I identify which altcoins might surge next? A> Focus on researching strong fundamentals, active development, and growing communities within emerging sectors like DeFi, AI, gaming, or layer-2 solutions. Following capital flow data can also provide clues. Q: What is the biggest mistake to avoid during an altcoin season? A> The biggest mistake is FOMO (Fear Of Missing Out) buying into projects that have already seen parabolic rises without understanding their value, and neglecting proper risk management like setting stop-losses.

While short-term price action remains choppy, on-chain indicators suggest that the deeper story may lie beneath the surface. A recent CryptoQuant chart highlights Bitcoin’s NVT Golden Cross, smoothed with a 100-day moving average, offering a clearer lens through which to evaluate the relationship between market valuation and on-chain activity. The Network Value to Transactions (NVT) ratio is often described as Bitcoin’s equivalent of a Price-to-Earnings multiple. Instead of corporate earnings, transaction volume serves as the proxy for economic output. In simple terms, the metric seeks to answer a fundamental question: Is Bitcoin’s market capitalization justified by the amount of real economic activity taking place on the network? When valuation expands faster than transaction volume, the market may be overheating. Conversely, when price lags behind network usage, it can signal undervaluation or excessive risk aversion. The NVT Golden Cross refines this framework by comparing short- and long-term trends in the ratio, helping identify periods when price diverges meaningfully from fundamentals. NVT Golden Cross Signals a Structural Valuation Reset CryptoQuant analyst Moreno emphasizes that the most valuable signals from the NVT Golden Cross tend to appear during deep negative deviations, when market psychology and fundamentals diverge sharply. In the current cycle, the indicator fell to a historically depressed level near -0.58, a zone that goes beyond simple bearish sentiment. According to the analysis, this level reflects a structural undervaluation of the Bitcoin network, where price compression outpaced any meaningful decline in on-chain economic activity. Such conditions are typically observed during phases of forced deleveraging and elevated risk aversion. In these environments, liquidity exits speculative positions aggressively, pushing prices lower even as the underlying network continues to process transactions at relatively stable levels. This imbalance creates valuation gaps that have, in past cycles, marked important inflection points rather than definitive market tops. The key development now is the recovery of the NVT Golden Cross from -0.58 toward approximately -0.32. This move suggests that price is beginning to realign with transaction-driven fundamentals following a sharp valuation reset. However, the indicator remains in negative territory, implying that Bitcoin is still priced conservatively relative to its on-chain utility. Moreno notes that this setup is consistent with a transition phase, where the market moves from deep undervaluation toward equilibrium. Historically, such periods have aligned with accumulation and more disciplined capital allocation, laying the groundwork for healthier, structurally supported price discovery. Bitcoin Consolidates Above Long-Term Support as Trend Weakens The weekly chart shows Bitcoin trading near the $88,000 level after a sharp corrective phase from the cycle highs above $120,000. Price is currently consolidating just above the rising 200-day moving average (green), which sits around the mid-$80,000s and represents a critical long-term trend support. This zone has historically acted as a pivot between sustained bull markets and deeper corrective phases, making the current structure especially important. Momentum, however, has clearly weakened. Bitcoin has lost the 50-day moving average (blue) and failed to reclaim it on recent attempts, signaling that short- to medium-term control remains with sellers. The slope of the 50-day MA has started to flatten, reinforcing the idea of a transition from expansion to consolidation. At the same time, the 100-day moving average is curling lower, adding overhead resistance in the $95,000–$100,000 range. Selling pressure increased during the breakdown from the $100,000 area, while the recent bounce toward $88,000 has occurred on comparatively lighter volume. This suggests that buyers are defending support but lack conviction for a sustained reversal. As long as Bitcoin holds above the 200-day MA, the broader uptrend remains technically intact. However, failure to defend the $85,000–$88,000 zone would open the door to a deeper retracement, while bullish confirmation requires a decisive reclaim of the 50-day moving average with expanding volume.

This potential move not only poses significant financial risks for the firm but could also have broader implications for the cryptocurrency sector, with analysts estimating that it could result in losses up to $9 billion in demand for its shares. Industry-Wide Consequences The MSCI proposed in October that companies holding digital assets comprising 50% or more of their total assets should be removed from its global benchmarks, arguing that such companies resemble investment funds, which are excluded from its indexes. However, many firms, including Strategy, assert that they are operational companies creating innovative products and argue that MSCI’s proposal is biased against the cryptocurrency industry. Related Reading: Solana (SOL) Support Shattered, Potential $100 Test Looms, Says Analyst MSCI is currently conducting a public consultation, and analysts warn that if it decides to exclude Digital Asset Treasury (DAT) companies, it could prompt other index providers to follow suit. “The conversation already extends beyond just MSCI… to the eligibility of DATs in equity indexes in general,” said Kaasha Saini, head of index strategy at Jefferies, who anticipates that most equity indexes will align with MSCI’s decisions. Asset managers are believed to hold as much as 30% of a large-cap company’s free float, leading to potentially significant outflows if these companies are dropped from major indexes. This situation is particularly precarious for the DAT sector, which often finances its token purchases by selling stock. The company’s CEO, Phong Le, and co-founder Michael Saylor addressed the potential MSCI exclusion in a public letter. They estimated that such a move could lead to $2.8 billion worth of the company’s stock being liquidated and may “chill” the entire industry. In their letter, they explained that excluding DATs could shut them out from the roughly $15 trillion passive investment market, drastically undermining their competitive standing. Major Outflows Predicted For Strategy Analysts at TD Cowen estimated in November that around $2.5 billion of Strategy’s market value is linked to MSCI, with an additional $5.5 billion reliant on other indexes. JPMorgan’s analysis suggested that if MSCI were to exclude Strategy, the company could see $2.8 billion in outflows, a figure that could rise to $8.8 billion if it faced exclusion from other indexes, such as the Nasdaq 100, the CRSP US Total Market Index, and various Russell indexes owned by LSEG. In addition to Strategy, MSCI’s preliminary list identifies 38 companies at risk of exclusion, with a combined issuer market cap of $46.7 billion as of September 30, including French firm Capital B, which is also investing in Bitcoin.

Matt Cole, CEO of US-based Bitcoin buyer Strive—which is not at risk of exclusion—notes that the proposals have largely been factored into market valuations. He added, “On a longer-term basis, I think it raises the cost of capital for all Bitcoin treasury companies.” At the time of writing, the firm’s stock, which trades on the Nasdaq under the ticker symbol MSTR, was trading at $165, marking gains of almost 4% ahead of the close of trading this week.

You’re not alone. The Bitcoin price is facing significant headwinds as a wave of concerning economic data from the United States sends shockwaves through global markets. Investors, spooked by the numbers, are executing a classic maneuver: the flight to safety. This shift in sentiment is creating a challenging environment for cryptocurrencies, pulling capital away from volatile assets like Bitcoin and into perceived stable harbors. Why is the Bitcoin Price Under Pressure? The recent slump in the Bitcoin price isn’t happening in a vacuum. It’s a direct reaction to fundamental economic signals. According to a Cointelegraph analysis, two key factors are driving the sell-off. First, recent U.S. employment figures came in weaker than expected, hinting at a slowing economy. Second, broader economic growth metrics are also flashing warning signs. When traditional markets get nervous, the ripple effects are felt acutely in the crypto space. This creates a perfect storm for Bitcoin. The asset, often touted as ‘digital gold,’ is currently being treated as a risk-on investment by the majority of the market. Therefore, when fear grips investors, they retreat to assets with a long history as stores of value during turmoil. The Safe Haven Shift: Where is the Money Going? So, if money is flowing out of Bitcoin, where is it going? The answer lies in traditional finance. Investors are pivoting hard towards assets known for their stability during economic uncertainty. U.S. Treasury Bonds: Demand for government debt has surged. Bonds are seen as one of the safest bets, especially when economic growth falters. Gold: The classic safe-haven asset is seeing renewed interest as a tangible store of value outside the financial system. The U.S. Dollar: The dollar often strengthens during global uncertainty as investors seek liquidity and stability. This mass migration is compounded by shifting expectations from the Federal Reserve. With sticky inflation and a still-strong labor market, the likelihood of an imminent interest rate cut has diminished. Higher rates for longer make yield-bearing, safe assets like bonds more attractive compared to non-yielding cryptocurrencies, further pressuring the Bitcoin price . Is This Just a U.S. Problem? While the U.S. data is the primary catalyst, global economic worries are adding fuel to the fire. For instance, Japan recently slipped into an unexpected recession. This global economic fragility reinforces the risk-off mood. Investors are not just reacting to one country’s data; they are reassessing global growth prospects. In such an environment, high-volatility assets like Bitcoin are often the first to be sold, regardless of their long-term potential. The key takeaway is that cryptocurrency markets remain deeply interconnected with traditional finance. Macroeconomic indicators, central bank policies, and global risk sentiment are powerful forces that can override crypto-specific narratives in the short term. What Can Investors Do During This Bitcoin Price Weakness? Market downturns, while stressful, are a normal part of the investment cycle. Here are some actionable insights: Assess Your Risk Tolerance: Ensure your portfolio allocation to crypto aligns with your long-term goals and ability to handle volatility. Consider Dollar-Cost Averaging (DCA): For long-term believers, a lower Bitcoin price can be an opportunity to accumulate assets gradually at a discount. Diversify: Don’t put all your capital into one asset class. A diversified portfolio can better weather different economic storms. Stay Informed: Follow credible sources to understand the macro trends driving market sentiment beyond daily price movements. Conclusion: Navigating the Storm The current Bitcoin price action is a stark reminder that cryptocurrencies are not yet decoupled from traditional market forces. The flight to safety, triggered by poor U.S. economic data and global recession fears, is a powerful short-term headwind. However, for patient investors, these periods of fear and selling often create the foundations for future growth. The fundamental narrative around Bitcoin and digital assets continues to evolve, but its journey will inevitably be marked by volatility as it interacts with the wider economic world. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q: How long will this Bitcoin price downturn last? A: It’s impossible to predict exact timelines. The duration will depend on upcoming economic data, Federal Reserve policy signals, and broader global market sentiment. Historically, crypto markets recover, but the timing is always uncertain. Q: Should I sell my Bitcoin now? A: This is a personal decision based on your investment strategy. Selling during a dip locks in losses. Many long-term investors view these periods as buying opportunities, but you should never invest money you cannot afford to lose. Q: What economic data should I watch? A: Key indicators include the U.S. Consumer Price Index (CPI) for inflation, monthly Non-Farm Payrolls for employment, and Gross Domestic Product (GDP) for growth. Federal Reserve meeting minutes and statements are also critical. Q: Are all cryptocurrencies affected the same way? A> Generally, yes. Bitcoin often sets the trend for the broader crypto market. During strong risk-off events, most altcoins tend to fall even more sharply due to their higher volatility and perceived risk. Q: Is this a good time to buy Bitcoin? A> For investors with a long-term horizon and a strategy like Dollar-Cost Averaging, lower prices can be attractive. However, trying to ‘time the bottom’ is extremely difficult and risky. Q: Does this mean Bitcoin failed as a safe haven? A> In the short term, the market is not treating it as one. Bitcoin’s narrative as a hedge against inflation and systemic risk is a long-term thesis that is still being tested over multiple economic cycles.

He says a memecoin launch tied to the president, coming just days before his return to the White House, helped turn a once-bipartisan push for basic crypto rules into a political hot potato. Political Optics Shift Quickly According to Hoskinson, crypto had been building bipartisan momentum and a bill known as the Clarity Act looked likely to win broad support — with around 70 senators expected to vote in favor at one point. That momentum faded when the market saw the president enter the arena with his own token, Hoskinson said, making it politically risky for many Democrats to back crypto measures. CHARLES HOSKINSON: TRUMP’S MEMECOIN DERAILED CRYPTO REGULATION Charles Hoskinson says crypto was on track for a bipartisan regulatory win, until TrumpCoin changed the optics. According to Hoskinson, the CLARITY Act was expected to pass with broad support in late 2024. Around 70… pic.twitter.com/zpA7TRilqV — CryptosRus (@CryptosR_Us) December 19, 2025 Strong Language Hoskinson called the subject a “third rail,” meaning politicians and many industry figures avoid it because it brings big political risk. He told reporters that, in his view, the launch of the memecoin changed how the public and lawmakers linked crypto to one political figure, a shift that made clean rule-making harder. Silence Inside The Industry Reports have disclosed that many crypto executives kept their distance from public criticism. Hoskinson said industry leaders feared losing access to policy talks or being shut out of private meetings if they spoke out. That worry, he argued, led to a quiet industry response even as the rules debate grew more urgent. Timing And Rule Order Raise Concerns Hoskinson also criticized earlier projects connected to the president, including World Liberty Financial , and questioned the timing of launching a commercial crypto product while influence over policy was possible. “You shouldn’t launch a product first and then make the rules,” he said, arguing that regulations should come before big political actors push private ventures into the market. What This Means For Lawmakers Based on reports, the fallout has made committee work and markups more fraught. Lawmakers who once saw an opportunity to write clear rules now face greater political cost from appearing to side with one high-profile figure. That dynamic could push the timetable for formal votes and hearings further out, officials and analysts say. Hoskinson framed his critique as a warning about mixing personal ventures and political power at a moment when the industry needs steady rules. Whether his view will change the debate is uncertain. What is clear is that linking crypto to a single political brand has complicated efforts to secure broad legal ground rules, and that may slow a process many in the market had hoped would be straightforward.

Some analysts have suggested that the altcoin is poised to bounce, but others warned that a potential rally could be short-lived. Related Reading: Bitcoin Mirrors Q1 2025 Playbook, Is It Headed To $70,000 Before Year’s End? Solana To Tag Higher Levels Soon On Friday, Solana recovered from the latest drop and surged 7.7% toward the $125 area. The cryptocurrency fell nearly 9% on Thursday afternoon amid a broader market correction, sending its price to an eight-month low of $116. Amid the pullback, SOL’s price breached below a crucial high timeframe level, the around $120 mark, for the first time since April before recovering. Analyst Crypto Batman noted the altcoin “is not only at its major support level, the same one that has held price for the past 2 years.” In addition, the cryptocurrency is also forming a bullish divergence on the 3-day timeframe, “exactly like what we saw before the major bottom” at the start of Q2, the market observer added. To him, this suggests that Solana could bottom soon and see the start of a recovery rally to the macro range highs. However, another market observer affirmed that even if a retest of the higher levels is likely, “context matters here.” Analyst Crypto Scient highlighted that SOL’s price is currently at the range lows of its multi-year range, recording the first retest of this area after being rejected from the range highs. “One could argue SOL has been distributive for nearly two years now. That’s fair,” he explained, “[but] range lows rarely break on the first attempt.” Moreover, Scient pointed out that there’s significant liquidity left between the $175–$190 levels that “should get tagged at some point, even within a broader bearish environment.” As a result, the analyst considers that a “move higher to clean liquidity before any deeper downside would make far more sense.” December Close To Define SOL’s Fate? Analyst Rekt Capital affirmed that the $123 horizontal support remains the “defining level” that Solana must hold to prevent a major breakdown to multi-year lows. He detailed rebounds from this support have historically produced “outsized upside expansions,” with 140% and 100% moves. However, each rebound from this level has been progressively weaker over time, with the most recent bounce only managing to rally 15%. This signals a “sharp deceleration in upside responsiveness at this level,” which is important to consider as the compression in rebound magnitude could affect SOL’s monthly close. According to the analysis, a monthly close above the macro support would keep Solana positioned for a weaker rally, but a close below $123 would substantially change the structure. The second case would suggest that distribution has already started and confirm “how much this support has weakened since the last meaningful rebound that produced a near 2x move earlier this year.” Related Reading: Did Crypto Investors Stop Believing In The Four-Year Cycle? Analyst Weighs In Moreover, it would begin to mirror SOL’s performance in early 2022, when a similar price action preceded “macro relief moves during the opening phase of the Bear Market, including the decisive breakdown that occurred at the turn of that year.” Ultimately, the analyst warned that it remains to be seen whether the altcoin can close December above this crucial level and rebound, or if a breakdown “accelerates distribution sooner rather than later.” As of this writing, Solana is trading at $126, a 3.4% decline in the weekly timeframe.
