The company behind the popular AI coding assistant has acquired Graphite, a startup specializing in AI-powered code review and debugging, for a price reportedly ‘way over’ Graphite’s last valuation of $290 million. This acquisition represents more than just another corporate transaction—it’s a fundamental shift in how AI will accelerate software development from conception to deployment. Why Cursor AI’s Graphite Acquisition Changes Everything The timing of this acquisition couldn’t be more strategic. As AI-generated code becomes increasingly common, the quality and reliability of that code have emerged as critical bottlenecks. Developers using AI coding assistants like Cursor AI often find themselves spending significant time debugging and reviewing AI-generated output. Graphite’s specialized technology addresses this exact pain point with innovative features like ‘stacked pull requests,’ which allow developers to work on multiple dependent changes simultaneously without waiting for approvals. This acquisition creates a powerful synergy: Cursor AI’s strength in generating code combined with Graphite’s expertise in reviewing and debugging that same code. The result is a more complete development workflow that could significantly reduce the time between writing code and shipping production-ready software. The Competitive Landscape of AI Code Review Tools Cursor AI isn’t operating in a vacuum. The AI code review space has become increasingly competitive, with several players vying for dominance: Company Valuation Specialization Recent Funding Graphite (now part of Cursor AI) $290M+ AI code review with stacked PRs Acquired by Cursor AI CodeRabbit $550M AI-powered code review Valuation set September 2025 Greptile Undisclosed AI code understanding $25M Series A (Fall 2025) What makes Graphite particularly valuable is its unique approach to the code review process. While Cursor AI already offered AI-powered code review through its Bugbot product, Graphite’s technology represents a more sophisticated, specialized solution that complements rather than duplicates existing capabilities. The Strategic Benefits of Combining AI Coding and Review The integration of Cursor AI and Graphite offers several compelling advantages for software development teams: Faster Development Cycles: By combining code generation with automated review, teams can move from idea to production more rapidly Higher Code Quality: AI-powered review catches bugs and issues that human reviewers might miss Reduced Developer Burnout: Automating repetitive review tasks allows developers to focus on more creative work Consistent Code Standards: AI review ensures all code meets organizational standards automatically Scalable Code Review: Teams can handle larger codebases and more frequent deployments Behind the Deal: The Network Effect of Shared Investors This acquisition wasn’t just about technology—it was also about relationships. The deal reveals an interesting network effect in the venture capital world. Both Cursor AI (through its parent company Anysphere) and Graphite share several key investors, including Accel and Andreessen Horowitz. This common investor base likely facilitated the acquisition discussions and created alignment around strategic goals. Furthermore, the personal connections run deep. Michael Truell, co-founder and CEO of Anysphere, first met Graphite’s co-founders—Merrill Lutsky, Greg Foster, and Thomas Reimers—through the Neo Scholar program before launching Cursor AI. Neo, Ali Partovi’s early-stage venture firm, had backed Graphite at the seed stage, creating a foundation of trust and shared vision that made this acquisition possible. Anysphere’s Aggressive Acquisition Strategy The Graphite acquisition represents just the latest move in Anysphere’s aggressive expansion strategy. The company, which was valued at $29 billion in November 2025, has been actively acquiring complementary technologies and talent: Growth by Design: Acquired last month, this tech recruiting strategy company helps Anysphere attract top talent Koala Talent Acquisition: In July 2025, Anysphere acquired talent from AI-powered CRM startup Koala for a post-money valuation of $129 million Graphite Acquisition: The current deal, which brings specialized AI code review capabilities This pattern suggests that Anysphere is building not just a product, but an entire ecosystem around AI-powered software development. What This Means for Software Development The integration of AI coding assistants with AI review tools represents a fundamental shift in how software gets built. We’re moving toward a future where: AI handles routine coding tasks and initial reviews Human developers focus on architecture, creativity, and complex problem-solving Development cycles accelerate dramatically Code quality improves through consistent, automated review Teams can scale their output without proportional increases in headcount FAQs About the Cursor AI and Graphite Acquisition What is Cursor AI?

In its filings, the crypto exchange is seeking declaratory and injunctive relief, arguing that prediction markets fall under the exclusive jurisdiction of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) rather than state gaming regulators. Who Controls Prediction Markets? The company stated that federal law already assigns regulatory authority for these products to the CFTC, which leaves states without the power to restrict or prohibit them under gambling statutes. The lawsuits come as Coinbase prepares to enter the prediction markets space through a partnership with Kalshi, a CFTC-regulated platform, and plans to roll out event-based contract trading across the US starting in January 2026. Coinbase warned in court filings that state intervention could cause immediate and “irreparable harm” by blocking access to federally regulated products in certain jurisdictions. The company is responding to actions by several states that have sought to classify event contracts, particularly those linked to sports outcomes, as illegal gambling unless operators obtain state-issued betting licenses. According to the crypto exchange, this interpretation conflicts with federal commodities law. The exchange said that Congress granted the CFTC broad authority over derivatives and commodities, with only a limited set of exclusions that do not include sporting events. As such, Coinbase added that sports-related event contracts remain subject to federal oversight. The company has also highlighted the differences between prediction markets and traditional sportsbooks. Unlike casinos, which set odds and profit from customer losses, prediction markets function as neutral venues that match buyers and sellers without taking directional risk. Coinbase’s Chief Legal Officer, Paul Grewal, tweeted “We’re right on the law and the facts. And we will prove it.” The lawsuits arrive amid growing scrutiny from state regulators as prediction markets have surged in popularity. Platforms such as Kalshi and Polymarket have generated billions of dollars in trading volume over the past year and have drawn increased regulatory attention as a result. Earlier this month, Connecticut regulators issued cease-and-desist orders against several companies offering event-based contracts, triggering legal challenges and temporary pauses on enforcement. Prediction Markets Boom Regulatory woes aside, the sector has also seen fresh momentum in 2025 from new product launches, reinforcing expectations of broader adoption. Robinhood CEO Vlad Tenev recently predicted significant long-term growth for crypto-based prediction markets. The exec even described the sector as entering the early stages of a “prediction market supercycle.” Tenev said adoption and trading volumes could expand dramatically as platforms increasingly price real-world events using blockchain infrastructure.

According to the model, all three assets could see extreme volatility, with sharp moves possible to the upside or downside before year-end. Below is a summary of DeepSeek’s dual-track outlook, outlining both optimistic and pessimistic price paths for each cryptocurrency through the end of December. XRP (XRP): DeepSeek AI Warns of Possible Collapse to $0.20 or Moonshot Surge Toward $10 In its bearish case, DeepSeek AI estimates that Ripple’s XRP ($XRP) could fall dramatically from its current level near $1.88 to as low as $0.20. Such a move would imply a drawdown of roughly 89% if selling pressure and negative sentiment intensify. Source: DeepSeek This scenario would sharply contrast with XRP’s strong performance earlier in the year, when the token reached its first new all-time high (ATH) in seven years. XRP peaked at $3.65 in July, shortly after Ripple secured a major legal victory against the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. Throughout much of 2025, XRP has largely traded within a $2 to $3 range. Its relative strength index (RSI) is currently hovering near 39 and trending higher, suggesting renewed interest from traders looking to buy at discounted levels. On the bullish end of the spectrum, DeepSeek projects a decisive breakout that could lift XRP by more than 432%, pushing the price toward $10 by the end of the year. The recent launch of five spot XRP exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in the U.S. could help drive fresh institutional demand during the holiday period, following a pattern previously seen with Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs. More ETF approvals are expected in the months ahead, raising the odds that 2026 becomes a defining year for XRP. Investors building positions at current prices could benefit a lot. Bitcoin (BTC): DeepSeek Sees Path to $250,000 or Pullback to $20,000 Bitcoin ($BTC) , the world’s largest cryptocurrency by market value, set a new all-time high of $126,080 on October 6. Looking further out, DeepSeek’s extended forecast places BTC as high as $200,000 by 2026. Frequently likened to digital gold, Bitcoin continues to draw interest from both institutional and retail investors seeking hedges against economic uncertainty. BTC now accounts for more than $1.75 trillion of the roughly $3.05 trillion total crypto market capitalization. As inflation pressures ease and market sentiment improves heading into the holidays, Bitcoin could attempt another run toward recent highs. The Federal Reserve’s latest interest rate cut may also boost liquidity, supporting risk assets through December. However, DeepSeek cautions that a sustained wave of selling could drag BTC back toward the $20,000 level, marking the start of a crypto winter throughout 2026. Even if it seems very ambitious the AI model maintains that its $200,000 upside target remains plausible in early 2026, particularly if U.S. policymakers deliver clearer crypto regulations and move forward with plans for a U.S. Strategic Bitcoin Reserve. Dogecoin (DOGE): DeepSeek AI Projects Rally to $1 or Slide Toward $0.03 Launched in 2013 as a parody cryptocurrency, Dogecoin ($DOGE) has since grown into a major digital asset with a market capitalization of roughly $22 billion. It now represents close half of the estimated $44 billion meme-coin sector. DOGE formed several bullish chart patterns in late summer and early autumn, but momentum has weakened in recent weeks. Under DeepSeek’s bearish scenario, Dogecoin could fall to around $0.03, marking a decline of about 77% from its current price near $0.1318. Dogecoin’s all-time high of $0.7316 was recorded during the retail-driven rally of 2021, and the long-awaited move to $1 has yet to materialize. Still, DeepSeek’s optimistic outlook suggests DOGE could surprise the market with a rally of more than 650%, potentially reaching parity with the dollar, a 7.5x increase from current levels. Meanwhile, real-world adoption of Dogecoin continues to grow. Tesla accepts DOGE for select merchandise, and major payment platforms such as PayPal and Revolut have added support for Dogecoin transactions. Maxi Doge (MAXI): A Rapidly Growing Meme Coin Not Included in DeepSeek’s Forecast While DeepSeek’s analysis centers on established cryptocurrencies, early-stage presale projects often offer far greater upside potential. One such project attracting increasing attention is Maxi Doge ($MAXI) , which has already raised nearly $4.4 million as it positions itself as a potential successor to Dogecoin. MAXI revolves around the character of Maxi Doge, a high-octane crypto degenerate and distant relative of the original Dogecoin. The project leans heavily into meme culture, portraying Maxi as obsessed with heavy lifting, extreme leverage trading and rallying a hyper-active MAXI DOGE community. Issued as an ERC-20 token, MAXI runs on Ethereum’s proof-of-stake network. This gives it advantages in energy efficiency and developer access compared to Dogecoin’s older proof-of-work architecture. The ongoing presale offers staking rewards of up to 71% APY, though yields are designed to decline as more participants join. MAXI is currently priced at $0.000274 in its latest presale round, with automatic price increases scheduled for future stages. Tokens can be purchased using MetaMask or Best Wallet .

56059654,https://cryptonews.com/?p=466129,1766183700,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/52/56059654.jpeg,"Best Crypto To Buy Now 19 December – XRP, SOL, ETH",https://cryptonews.com/news/best-crypto-to-buy-now-19-december-xrp-sol-eth/,"With speculation growing around a possible 2026 crypto bull run, particularly if U.S. lawmakers finally introduce comprehensive crypto regulations, the period heading into Christmas is shaping up as the best time to load up on crypto if you believe in it. Bitcoin has stayed below the $90,000 level since Sunday, trading steadily above $87,000 over the past 24 hours. A key trend worth noting is Bitcoin’s steady decline in market dominance since summer . Historically, this shift often signals capital rotating from Bitcoin into altcoins. In this environment, projects such as XRP, Solana and Ethereum offer the best potential to grow value in the coming year. XRP (XRP): Reshaping Global Payments Ripple’s XRP ($XRP) remains a major force in the cross-border payments space, thanks to its near-instant transaction speeds and extremely low fees. Built to modernize global payment rails, the XRP Ledger (XRPL) is a faster and cheaper alternative to legacy systems like SWIFT. XRP’s importance has been recognized at the institutional level, with references appearing in reports from the United Nations Capital Development Fund and the White House. Supported by Ripple’s expanding network of fintech partnerships, XRP has climbed to become the third-largest cryptocurrency outside of stablecoins, boasting a market capitalization above $113 billion. Following the resolution of Ripple’s long-running legal battle with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, XRP surged to its first new all-time high (ATH) in seven years, topping out at $3.65. Since then, the token has pulled back by roughly 49% and is currently trading near $1.87. The debut of five spot XRP ETFs in the U.S. has driven fresh institutional interest, though much of the demand is not reflected in current prices, probably due to the market pricing it in. Looking ahead, further ETF approvals and clearer regulatory guidance could act as powerful tailwinds. Under favorable conditions, XRP could move back toward record highs by New Year. Solana (SOL): High-Speed Blockchain Targeting a Potential $1,200 Move Solana ($SOL) has firmly established itself as a leading smart-contract platform, known for its rapid transaction processing and minimal costs. With a market cap around $71 billion and nearly $9 billion in total value locked (TVL) across its DeFi ecosystem, Solana continues to stand out as Ethereum’s strongest rival. Recently launched Solana spot ETFs from firms such as Grayscale and Bitwise could pave the way for meaningful institutional inflows, similar to the capital surges that previously boosted Bitcoin and Ethereum. After sliding to around $100 earlier this year, SOL has rebounded and now trades close to $125, hovering at a key technical support level. Its also below its 30-day moving average, which suggests a small price surge back to $130 or $140 may happen over the weekend. The next significant resistance lies near $250. A clean break above that zone could send SOL past its prior all-time high of $293.31. In a strong holiday-driven rally, SOL could even hit $500 although weak festive performance is unlikely to cause any major losses, so in a bear case, Solana will probably hold the fort somewhere in the support zone it’s currently in. Beyond price action, Solana is also emerging as a preferred network for real-world asset (RWA) tokenization. Major financial players including BlackRock and Franklin Templeton have selected Solana to launch tokenized investment products. Ethereum ($ETH): The Smart-Contract Giant Prepares for Its Next Phase Ethereum ($ETH) continues to underpin decentralized finance and much of the broader Web3 landscape, supported by a market capitalization north of $357 billion. With more than $69 billion TVL , Ethereum remains the dominant platform for smart contracts and decentralized applications, reinforcing its central role in the blockchain ecosystem. In a strong market cycle, ETH could push toward the $6,500 level by the end of the year, a significant leap from its current price around $2,966 and well beyond its previous all-time high of $4,946 set in August. The recent Fusaka upgrade, implemented at the start of the month, substantially improves data availability for Layer-2 networks while enhancing security, efficiency and scalability. These changes could help drive ETH toward $5,000 before month-end. That said, a move to five figures will likely depend on clearer U.S. regulations and a supportive macroeconomic environment, both of which could unlock greater institutional participation. Earlier this year, ETH broke out from a bullish flag formation, rallying from $1,800 to a fresh peak. Sustained momentum will be essential if Ethereum is to get a new ATH by New Year.

On-chain metrics show little evidence of broad holder distribution, suggesting that these dips are not being driven by investors exiting their positions. Instead, the weakness in price appears to stem from the market structure issues. Why Structural Weakness Is Often Temporary These Bitcoin dips aren’t coming from selling pressure; they’re coming from stablecoin-denominated shorts. The co-founder of GlydeGG, Sweep, revealed on X that when large amounts of leverage enter the system through dollar or stablecoin, market makers don’t just let the price move. Related Reading: The Bearish Structure That Puts Bitcoin Price At $92,550, And Then $82,000 Their mandate is to remain neutral because neutrality demands balance. They achieve this by selling spot BTC, not because they’re bearish, but because neutrality requires it. As a result of that, the price drops without fear, panic, and without real spot. The United States doesn’t need to dump assets to influence global markets; it exports dollars. Those dollars become leverage, while leverage creates synthetic pressure, which in turn forces hedging, and hedging hits the spot markets; that’s the cycle. This is why recent sell-offs feel empty, because retail has already left. Currently, the market is rebalancing within a system price against a weakening currency, and all markets are now denominated in a currency that’s losing purchasing power. That’s why volatility rises even when conviction doesn’t change. This isn’t a bear market; it’s clearing the Liquidity Providers (LPs), which is how big players buy BTC cheaply without ever owning it. How Bitcoin Supply Dynamics Are Entering A New Phase An ambassador and partner of Wolfswapdotapp, Crypto Miners, has pointed out that the Bitcoin supply dynamics are shifting fast. According to K33Research, nearly $300 billion worth of previously dormant BTC re-entered circulation in 2025. This supply release has been driven by long-term holder sales, large OTC transactions, and ETF-related absorption, which represents one of the largest supply unlocks in BTC history. Related Reading: Bitcoin’s Make-or-Break Phase Begins: Weekly Support Holds, Momentum Fades On-chain data from CryptoQuant has shown that the long-term holder distribution over the last 30 days has reached its highest level in more than five years. At the same time, the selling pressure currently is outweighing demand, as ETF flows turn negative, and retail participation has weakened. Despite near-term fragility, K33 noted that this distribution phase may be approaching exhaustion. The early holder selling is expected to fade into early 2026, potentially setting the stage for renewed accumulation as institutional rebalancing stabilizes supply. For now, the markets remain sensitive, but structurally, this looks like a late-cycle supply redistribution rather than panic selling.

Transaction data surrounding $NIGHT tokens has now grown into new milestones in just a few weeks after launch . Although the entire market conditions are far from bullish, the surge in transaction count points to a structural increase in real activity on the Cardano blockchain. NIGHT Token Activity Sparks A Transaction Surge On Cardano The momentum traces back to data highlighted by blockchain explorer Cexplorer.io on the social media platform X . On Wednesday, the platform flagged that Cardano had processed over 122,000 transactions that contained the $NIGHT token, the native asset of the Midnight network. That figure has since adjusted, and transaction activity has been increasing since then. At the time of writing, the number of recorded transactions containing $NIGHT stands at 141,363, which indicates continued movement across wallets since their launch. This pattern shows that users are actively interacting with the token following its launch and that Cardano’s base layer is handling meaningful throughput tied directly to user engagement. What The Data Says About The Network’s Health The recent transaction data paints a more encouraging picture for Cardano, particularly in light of the long-standing narrative that the network lacks organic on-chain activity. For years, the network has often been dismissed as a so-called ghost chain, with critics arguing about its organic usage. This perception has also carried over into Cardano’s DeFi metrics, where co-founder Charles Hoskinson has previously pointed to a gap between on-chain application usage and the roughly 1.3 million users actively participating in Cardano’s staking system. Furthermore, the creation of Midnight and its native token NIGHT is positive for Cardano as a deliberate expansion of its ecosystem. Midnight was designed as a privacy-focused blockchain that works alongside the network to address long-standing concerns around confidential computation and data protection while still aligning with regulatory and compliance expectations. The Midnight sidechain uses zero-knowledge cryptography, and developers can build applications where sensitive information can still be private while allowing selective disclosure when needed. This approach positions Midnight as a practical privacy layer that fits into real-world use cases. The design and launch mechanics for Midnight and NIGHT make it so that community members needed to claim their token allocations through an official redemption portal and wait for them to thaw or unlock according to a predetermined schedule before they could be moved or fully utilized. On-chain activity tied to $NIGHT is one positive to look at amidst the current state of the Cardano network and its price action, which has been under persistent bearish pressure. ADA is trading at a 2025 low around the mid-$0.30s, which is indicative of the selling pressure across the entire crypto market.",Cardano|ADA|ADA news|ADA Price|adausd|ADAUSDT|Cardano blockchain|Cardano ecosystem|Cardano network|Cardano news|Cardano Price|Cexplorer.io|Charles Hoskinson|Midnight|NIGHT,EN,0,0,ADA|BLOCKCHAIN|MARKET|TRADING|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-12-19 23:00:48

According to his recent remarks, Portnoy considers the $1.75 range an attractive point to make a large purchase, describing it as a favorable entry after XRP’s recent pullback. XRP is currently trading near $1.87, following a short-term decline that briefly pushed the token to an intraday low of approximately $1.77, based on CoinGecko data. While the broader crypto market remains volatile, Portnoy appears to be monitoring XRP closely as it consolidates below recent highs. A Year Marked by Reversals Portnoy’s involvement with XRP throughout the year has been marked by frequent changes in positioning and sentiment. He has openly stated that his interest in the token is not driven by an assessment of its underlying technology or long-term fundamentals. Last night I bought $2,000,000 in crypto. When there’s blood in the streets I’m like a Great White Shark #DDTG pic.twitter.com/aKUXFoD4Xy — Dave Portnoy (@stoolpresidente) November 18, 2025 Instead, he has framed his participation as speculative, motivated largely by market momentum and fear of missing out. Earlier in the year, Portnoy publicly embraced XRP during a period of strong upward price movement, making bold statements about its potential and aligning himself closely with its retail supporter base. However, this optimism proved short-lived. In June, he exited his entire XRP position, which he later estimated to be worth around $3 million, selling near the $2.40 level. The decision reportedly followed a warning from an associate regarding possible regulatory risks tied to stablecoins and their broader implications for Ripple-related assets. Shortly after Portnoy sold, XRP rallied sharply , climbing to roughly $3.65. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 He later expressed public frustration over the timing of his exit, acknowledging that the move cost him substantial unrealized gains. Re-Entry and Current Strategy Following a subsequent market-wide downturn, Portnoy re-entered the crypto market, allocating about $1 million across XRP, Bitcoin, and Ethereum. He later confirmed that he rebuilt his XRP position around the $2.14 level, characterizing the earlier sell-off as an overreaction rather than a structural shift in outlook. With XRP now trading below its November levels, Portnoy appears prepared to adjust his position again. He has suggested that a decline to $1.75 would prompt him to either lower his average entry price or meaningfully increase the size of his holdings. While Portnoy’s trading approach continues to draw criticism for its emotional nature, his comments frequently attract attention due to his public profile. As XRP continues to fluctuate, his stated plans add to ongoing speculation around short-term price movements, though they remain personal views rather than investment guidance.

This announcement, made via the exchange’s X account, signals a significant step for the Brevis (BREV) token and its potential investors. For anyone tracking the evolution of digital assets, understanding what this roadmap inclusion means is crucial. It’s not a guaranteed listing, but it’s a powerful vote of confidence from one of the world’s largest and most regulated cryptocurrency exchanges. What Does It Mean When Coinbase Adds BREV to Its Roadmap? First, let’s demystify the ‘listing roadmap.’ This is a public-facing document where Coinbase announces assets it is considering for future trading support. When Coinbase adds BREV to this list, it indicates the token has passed initial technical and compliance reviews. It enters a queue for deeper evaluation. This process enhances transparency and allows the community to anticipate potential new listings. Therefore, the news is a bullish signal, though final approval is not automatic. Why Is Brevis (BREV) Gaining This Attention? To understand why the decision for Coinbase to add BREV matters, we must look at the Brevis project itself. Brevis is a cross-chain smart contract platform designed to improve how blockchains communicate and share data. Its core promise is greater interoperability—a key challenge in today’s fragmented crypto ecosystem. The potential listing on a major exchange like Coinbase could provide the liquidity, visibility, and credibility needed to accelerate its adoption. This move suggests that Coinbase’s evaluators see merit in Brevis’s underlying technology and market potential. What Are the Immediate Implications for Traders? The immediate effect is often market speculation. News that Coinbase adds BREV typically triggers increased trading activity for the token on other decentralized and centralized exchanges where it is already available. However, savvy investors know this is a moment for research, not impulsive action. Consider these points: Increased Scrutiny: The token will be under a microscope, with every project detail examined by the market. Volatility: Price swings based on rumor and anticipation are common around roadmap announcements. Long-term vs. Short-term: The real value is in the project’s fundamentals, not just the exchange hype. How Does This Fit Coinbase’s Broader Strategy? This isn’t an isolated event. Coinbase adds tokens like BREV as part of a deliberate strategy to expand its altcoin offerings and cater to a diverse user base seeking exposure to innovative protocols. By carefully selecting projects that address real-world blockchain problems—like interoperability—Coinbase strengthens its position as a gateway to the next generation of web3. Each new asset broadens the ecosystem accessible through its user-friendly platform. What Should Potential Investors Do Next? If you’re considering BREV after hearing Coinbase adds it to the roadmap, a disciplined approach is key. First, conduct your own research (DYOR). Visit the official Brevis website, read its whitepaper, and understand its use cases. Second, monitor official channels for updates from both Brevis and Coinbase. Finally, remember that inclusion on the roadmap is one step in a longer journey. A final listing decision could take weeks or months, and the market can change rapidly in that time. Conclusion: A Step Toward Mainstream Recognition The announcement that Coinbase adds BREV to its listing roadmap is a pivotal moment for the Brevis project. It represents a bridge between innovative blockchain technology and mainstream crypto accessibility. While it brings exciting possibilities for liquidity and growth, it also demands cautious optimism from the community. The focus should remain on the project’s long-term utility and development progress. As the crypto landscape evolves, strategic endorsements from major exchanges will continue to be a critical factor in shaping which projects succeed. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q: Does Coinbase adding BREV to the roadmap guarantee it will be listed? A: No, it does not guarantee a listing. It means the asset is under official consideration and has passed preliminary checks. The final decision depends on further technical and legal reviews. Q: When will BREV be listed on Coinbase if approved? A: Coinbase does not provide specific timelines for assets on its roadmap. The process can vary in length based on multiple factors. Q: Can I buy BREV on Coinbase now? A> No, not yet. The token is only on the listing roadmap. It is not available for trading on Coinbase until an official listing announcement is made. Q: Where can I trade BREV currently? A> BREV may be available on other cryptocurrency exchanges or decentralized platforms (DEXs). Always use reputable sources and verify contract addresses to avoid scams. Q: What is the main purpose of the Brevis (BREV) token? A> Brevis aims to enable cross-chain smart contracts, allowing different blockchains to communicate and share data securely, solving a major interoperability challenge. Q: How does a Coinbase listing typically affect a token’s price? A> Listing announcements often lead to increased buying pressure and price volatility due to greater accessibility and credibility, but past performance does not guarantee future results.

56061409,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=248371,1766187911,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,The Contrarian Truth: Why Bitcoin and Ethereum Prices Defy Social Media Sentiment,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/bitcoin-ethereum-social-media-sentiment/,"BitcoinWorld The Contrarian Truth: Why Bitcoin and Ethereum Prices Defy Social Media Sentiment Have you ever noticed that when everyone on social media is screaming ‘buy,’ the market often does the opposite? A fascinating analysis from crypto data firm Santiment reveals a powerful pattern: Bitcoin and Ethereum prices frequently move opposite to prevailing social media sentiment . This contrarian signal could be the key to avoiding herd mentality and making more informed investment decisions. What is the Social Media Sentiment Indicator? Social media sentiment refers to the overall mood or opinion expressed by retail investors on platforms like Twitter, Reddit, and Telegram. When sentiment is ‘bullish,’ the crowd is optimistic and expects prices to rise. ‘Bearish’ sentiment reflects fear or pessimism. Santiment’s data scientists track millions of posts to gauge this collective emotion. Their historical analysis shows a clear, counter-intuitive trend. Periods of extreme bullish chatter often precede price dips for both Bitcoin and Ethereum. Conversely, when fear dominates the conversation, a price recovery may be on the horizon. This pattern turns the common wisdom of ‘following the crowd’ on its head. Why Does This Inverse Relationship Happen? This phenomenon isn’t magic; it’s market psychology. When social media sentiment reaches a peak of euphoria, it often means most interested buyers have already entered the market. This leaves little new capital to drive prices higher, creating a sell opportunity. Consider these key drivers: Crowd Psychology: Extreme optimism can signal a market top, while pervasive fear can indicate a bottom. Whale Activity: Large, savvy investors may use retail sentiment as a counter-indicator for their moves. Market Efficiency: By the time a trend is dominant on social media, it’s often already priced in. How Can Traders Use This Insight? Santiment notes this pattern holds true across different strategies, from short-term swing trading to long-term investing. Therefore, monitoring social media sentiment can provide a valuable layer of context. For example, a trader might view overwhelmingly positive chatter as a potential warning sign to take profits or avoid new long positions. On the flip side, a wave of negative posts during a stable or rising market could hint at an undervalued buying opportunity. It’s not a perfect timing tool, but a powerful gauge of market extremes. What Are the Limitations of Sentiment Analysis? While insightful, sentiment data is just one piece of the puzzle. Relying on it alone is risky. Major news events, regulatory announcements, or macroeconomic shifts can override sentiment trends. Furthermore, sentiment analysis tools measure volume and tone, but cannot always distinguish between informed opinion and uninformed hype. Always combine sentiment indicators with: Technical analysis of price charts On-chain data (like exchange flows) Fundamental news and developments This multi-faceted approach leads to more robust decision-making. Actionable Takeaways for Your Crypto Strategy To leverage this insight, start by following credible data providers like Santiment that quantify social media sentiment . Practice observing the mood on your own feeds with a critical eye. When you feel the strong urge to buy because ‘everyone’ is bullish, pause and consider if the smart move might be to wait or even sell. Remember, successful investing often involves being fearful when others are greedy, and greedy when others are fearful. This timeless advice finds a modern, data-backed expression in the inverse relationship between crypto prices and online chatter. Conclusion: The Wisdom of the Contrarian The next time your social media feed is flooded with moon predictions or doom scenarios, take a deep breath. Santiment’s analysis provides a compelling reason to question the herd. By understanding that Bitcoin and Ethereum prices have a history of moving against the tide of popular social media sentiment , you equip yourself with a powerful contrarian lens. Use this knowledge not for reckless bets, but for disciplined, emotionally-detached analysis that can help you buy low and sell high. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q: Does this mean social media sentiment is always wrong? A: No. It means extreme sentiment often marks market turning points. Mild or neutral sentiment can coincide with steady trends. Q: Which social media platforms are most important for this analysis? A: Twitter (X) and Reddit are primary sources due to their large, vocal crypto communities. Telegram and Discord are also significant. Q: Can this strategy be applied to altcoins, not just Bitcoin and Ethereum? A: The principle may apply, but altcoins are often more susceptible to hype and manipulation, so sentiment can be a noisier signal. Q: How quickly do prices react to sentiment shifts? A> There’s no fixed timeline. Sometimes the reaction is within days, sometimes weeks. It signals a potential shift, not an immediate guarantee. Q: Where can I find reliable sentiment data? A> Firms like Santiment, LunarCrush, and The TIE offer specialized sentiment tracking tools and indices for cryptocurrencies. Found this insight into market psychology valuable?

Pro-crypto US Senator Cynthia Lummis, a powerful Republican voice from Wyoming, has announced she will not seek re-election after her current term ends. This decision marks a pivotal moment for digital asset policy in the United States. Who is Cynthia Lummis and Why Does Her Cryptocurrency Stance Matter? Cynthia Lummis is not just another senator. She chairs the Senate Banking Committee’s Subcommittee on Digital Assets, placing her at the epicenter of financial technology legislation. Her advocacy for clear, innovation-friendly cryptocurrency regulation has made her a cornerstone for the industry. In a post on X, she stated that serving Wyoming has been the honor of her life and that her decision came after careful thought. Her work extends beyond committee hearings. Lummis actively promoted legislation for a Bitcoin strategic reserve during the Trump administration, showcasing her forward-thinking approach to national finance. Therefore, her departure creates a vacuum in congressional crypto expertise. What Was Cynthia Lummis’s Vision for Cryptocurrency? Senator Lummis championed a regulatory framework that balanced consumer protection with fostering innovation. She understood that overly restrictive rules could push the burgeoning cryptocurrency industry overseas. Her efforts focused on: Clarity: Defining which agencies regulate different digital assets. Innovation: Creating sandboxes for new financial technologies. Strategic Adoption: Exploring how national reserves could include assets like Bitcoin. This vision made her a rare bipartisan figure on a complex issue. However, with her planned exit, the future of these initiatives becomes uncertain. What Does This Mean for the Future of Cryptocurrency Regulation? The announcement that Cynthia Lummis will not seek re-election sends ripples through the crypto community. Her leadership provided a consistent and knowledgeable voice in often chaotic legislative debates. The immediate questions are: Who will fill her role as a leading cryptocurrency advocate in the Senate? Will her bipartisan legislative efforts lose momentum? How will the industry adjust its lobbying strategy? Moreover, her absence may slow down critical bills aimed at providing regulatory clarity for exchanges, stablecoins, and custody services. The industry must now identify and support new champions who understand the technology’s potential and risks. How Can the Cryptocurrency Industry Respond? While the news is significant, it is not a catastrophe. The groundwork laid by advocates like Cynthia Lummis has educated many of her colleagues. The industry’s response should be strategic: Engage Early: Support and educate candidates running for her seat. Build Coalitions: Work with remaining pro-innovation senators from both parties. Focus on Education: Continue demystifying cryptocurrency for policymakers. The goal is to ensure the thoughtful approach championed by Senator Lummis continues, even after she leaves office. Conclusion: A Legacy of Cryptocurrency Advocacy Cynthia Lummis’s decision not to seek re-election closes a vital chapter in Washington’s relationship with digital assets. Her legacy as a pro-crypto senator provides a blueprint for future policymakers: combine principled advocacy with a deep understanding of the technology. The challenge now is for the industry and its allies to build upon her work, ensuring the United States remains competitive in the global financial revolution. The departure of a figure like Cynthia Lummis underscores that political support is not permanent and requires constant, engaged cultivation.

This marks a notable 30% decline over the past few months. Despite this setback, analysts at Citi express optimism for the cryptocurrency’s future, forecasting that its value will continue to rise through 2026. Optimistic Bitcoin Price Predictions According to Citi’s analysts, the base case for the Bitcoin price is set at $143,000, reflecting a potential 62% increase from current levels. In a more bullish scenario, the cryptocurrency could surge to over $189,000, indicating a substantial 114% increase. Conversely, the analysts also present a bear case for the leading crypto, with an estimated price around $78,500, which would represent an additional 10.6% decline from current trading levels. Related Reading: Solana (SOL) Support Shattered, Potential $100 Test Looms, Says Analyst The forecast from Citi relies on the assumption that investor adoption will persist, particularly with an influx of funds into exchange-traded funds (ETFs) projected to reach $15 billion. This influx is seen as a catalyst that could significantly boost the Bitcoin price. Furthermore, ongoing negotiations in the US Senate regarding their version of the crypto market structure bill, namely the CLARITY Act, which aims to regulate Bitcoin under the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), is anticipated to enhance market adoption. In contrast to Bitcoin, analysts express concerns regarding Ethereum’s (ETH) potential for growth. They argue that Ethereum, being viewed more as “programmable money,” has seen decreased activity, which has resulted in its current trading price of just below $3,000—40% below its all-time high of $4,964. Additional Catalyst For Price Growth Chris Neiger, an analyst at The Motley Fool, also attaches bullish predictions to the Bitcoin price future, highlighting that recent US job data reflects an unemployment rate increase to 4.6%, the highest since 2021. He asserted that if the Federal Reserve (Fed) chose to lower interest rates by 2026, the Bitcoin price could benefit since lower rates typically enhance the cryptocurrency’s value by making borrowing more affordable. In November, JPMorgan provided a more conservative estimate, suggesting that Bitcoin could reach $170,000 by 2026, with potential upside expected over the next six to twelve months.

Additionally, the establishment of the Strategic Bitcoin Reserve by the federal government has encouraged states to consider similar initiatives. Neiger concludes that just as ETFs have contributed to the credibility of cryptocurrencies and facilitated price increases, the formation of state-level Bitcoin reserves could serve as another critical driver propelling Bitcoin’s value higher in 2026.

BITO has maintained positive NAV and compelling distributions, even amid Bitcoin’s volatility; recent NAV growth is 63.77% over three years. Current downward pressure on BITO is viewed as temporary, with confidence in Bitcoin’s long-term upward trajectory supporting a bullish outlook. BITO is best used as a 3–5% portfolio allocation for income, with diversification and position sizing critical to managing Bitcoin-driven risks. Bullish Thesis Based upon my bullish outlook for Bitcoin heading into 2026, I see BITO surprising to the upside — with both growth and income as the price of Bitcoin jumps. My reason for being so bullish with Bitcoin is, first, the growing adaption by institutional investors and even countries, along with favorable support from the U.S. and other governments. For those reasons, and the conviction the four-year Bitcoin cycle of the past is over, makes me believe 2026 is going to be a good year for the crypto. Why I believe the four-year cycle is over is because the low amount of Bitcoin being mined from its inherent code, makes the number of new Bitcoin available less important, even as growing scarcity further props up the price. Growing demand and decreasing supply is the perfect recipe for the bull market in Bitcoin to continue. Bitcoin should continue to climb for some time into the future, but it'll continue to experience a lot of volatility, which will be a positive outcome for BITO. If my bullish thesis is correct, it means BITO will not only increase its distribution because of the option premiums generating income but will also enjoy growth in the share price of the ETF from the strength of Bitcoin's upward growth trajectory. Overview ProShares Bitcoin ETF ( BITO ) is the first ETF in the U.S. that was linked to Bitcoin (BTC-USD). It has consistently paid out hefty distributions on a consistent basis since it was introduced in October 2021. After Bitcoin reached its all-time high, the inevitable correction came, and the share price of BITO came under pressure in alignment with the price movement of Bitcoin. It doesn't own Bitcoin but utilizes swaps and futures to generate income for shareholders. Even with the volatility associated with Bitcoin, BITO has been able to maintain positive NAV during the time it has paid out distributions, as of the end of November 2025. Over the last three years NAV has been a positive 63.77%, although from inception it is at positive $3.98%. The reason for that is almost at the time of the introduction of the fund Bitcoin corrected for about a year. Seeking Alpha Since then, up until recently, it has experienced a prolonged upward move, along with the usual volatility. The performance of BITO moved in conjunction with the price movement of Bitcoin. In this article we'll look at why I believe BITO has an excellent future ahead of it, and why the current downward pressure should be only temporary. What It Is and What It does BITO used swaps and futures contracts with Bitcoin as the underlying, resulting in strong income generation which is paid out monthly. The primary purpose of the ETF is to generate income. It can at time generate growth, but it's a byproduct of the holding, not the main reason for introducing it to investors. I like how it works because there are other Bitcoin growth products that can be invested in, such as iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF (IBIT). Some have argued that it's better to invest in IBIT rather than BITO, but when the purpose to take a position in BITO is to generate consistent income, IBIT or similar ETFs don't make any sense in that regard. What the fund managers do is invest in Bitcoin futures traded on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange ((CME)). Being actively managed, the ETF managers can roll the contracts over, bringing ongoing exposure to the flagship crypto. That allows fund managers to provide investors exposure to the volatility related to Bitcoin in order to generate income. The risk associated with the strategy is if the price of Bitcoin remains subdued for a prolonged period of time. BITO and Bitcoin As mentioned above, BITO uses swaps and futures to generate income based upon the volatility associated with Bitcoin. How Bitcoin performs is how BITO will perform. For that reason, investors should have a solid grasp of Bitcoin in order to understand the strengths and weaknesses of BITO. If one isn't familiar and knowledgeable about Bitcoin, it would be easy to sell off if total returns start to show a loss. There is also the probability of being influenced by those that oppose Bitcoin and ETFs like BITO, primarily because they operate from a growth mindset. If one believes in Bitcoin, then BITO is an excellent way to gain exposure for those seeking to add significant income to one's overall portfolio. Seeking Alpha For me, I've been in Bitcoin for many years and have a solid grasp of what it is, why its future looks very bright, and why I believe the current correction is temporary. I see pullbacks as only breathers for the next lag up. With that in mind, it would take a lot for me to sell my BITO shares, even when they get hit hard like they have been. BITO Distributions BITO's distribution history is unique in that it actually struggled to pay out a strong dividend in 2023, where usually in the earlier stages of an ETF like BITO, they tend to pay out much higher earlier on and decline in payouts as the fund ages. Seeking Alpha As it went into 2024, the fund distributions started picking, with its highest and most consistent distributions coming in April 2024 to the end of the year, where it paid out well over $1.00 per share or unit at that time, and the two times it was under that it was $0.99 and change. In 2025 the distributions dropped a little but still paid out over $0.75 per share or unit, with the exceptions of $0.36 in April 2025, and $0.54 in May 2025. After that, distributions jumped nicely, even under more adverse conditions. Seeking Alpha What I particularly like about BITO is it had a long enough track record now to see how distributions are affected by the performance of Bitcoin, and so far, with a few exceptions, it continues to pay out a solid distribution monthly. Being able to do that while maintaining positive NAV is a strong accomplishment. I expect there to be a slight downturn in NAV for the quarter ended December 2025, because of the weakness in Bitcoin, but it shouldn't be much more than a slight turn to the red. Nonetheless, even if it turns to the red some with NAV and or its share price during this period of time, being able to pay out the level of distributions it is has done from month to month, makes it a strong performer in the high-yield income space. Risks Bitcoin risk The most obvious risk for BITO is its exposure to Bitcoin price movements. If the price of Bitcoin were to continue to be under pressure longer than expected by the market or investor, it would result in the probability of NAV erosion until the price of Bitcoin rebounds. While we haven't seen it in the ETF yet in any meaningful way, it's possible if Bitcoin were to remain under downward pressure it could result in distributions dropping to levels not experienced for any significant period of the fund since early 2024. Again, what has impressed me so far with BITO is how it has responded so well to the volatile nature of Bitcoin. It has dropped little in distribution levels from 2024 to 2025, but they still remain very compelling in a challenging market environment. Yet, how Bitcoin goes will be how BITO goes, and having exposure to only one underlying does present risk if the underlying underperforms for a long period of time. Portfolio risk Another risk not also thought of by investors is portfolio risk. What I mean by that is income-generating holdings like BITO should be part of an overall portfolio, rather than a standalone income holding. Those that aren't diversified and properly managing position sizing, could get hit harder than they need to be if they only have one or a few high-income yielding ETFs. Under that scenario, the risk is very high if even one of them gets hit hard. After all, the point of income is to be able to generate it without a portfolio shrinking disproportionately because of only a few, riskier holdings that have the potential to crash at some time. It's understandable when an investor is starting to build an income portfolio, because you have to start somewhere. But as shares are acquired it should be done with the idea that as soon as possible one should start adding shares from other income-generating ETFs as well. I tend to think of an ETF like BITO being in the 3% to 5% range of an overall income portfolio. For those that understand Bitcoin well and are bullish on the long-term future of it, maybe a little higher level of position sizing would be appropriate. That said, I would still continue to work on building a diversified portfolio and gradually work in a higher weighting for those that are bullish on BITO. How this is done should be considered in light of age, years to retirement, and specific income investing goals of each individual investor. Conclusion My BITO shares have been hit hard lately, but I don't even think in terms of selling any of them. I'm absolutely convinced the price of Bitcoin has a long, upward growth trajectory ahead of it, and BITO is an excellent way to ride that thesis. Not only will BITO continue to generate impressive income for those holding the ETF, but they, based upon past performance of the ETF in correlation with the price movement of Bitcoin, should also enjoy growth along with it. I don't invest in BITO with expectations I'll get any growth out of it, but after studying and owning a number of high-yield ETFs, it's among one that I'm most bullish on for growth and income long into the future. Before the recent decline in the price of Bitcoin, BITO was producing both growth and income for me, and I expect to continue to do so when Bitcoin reverses direction.",BITO,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|TRADING|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Seeking Alpha', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/seekingalpha.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",seekingalpha,2025-12-20 00:00:09

According to Coinbase’s latest market outlook, the answer is a resounding yes. The leading U.S. exchange projects that by 2026, digital assets will play a significantly larger and more integrated role in the core crypto financial system . This shift promises to reshape how we save, invest, and transact. Let’s explore the key drivers behind this pivotal forecast. What’s Driving Crypto Into the Mainstream Financial System? Coinbase’s ‘2026 Crypto Market Outlook’ identifies several powerful forces converging to push crypto into the mainstream. First, the report highlights the urgent need for clearer regulatory frameworks. Clear rules provide the certainty that large institutions require to invest confidently.

What Challenges Must the Crypto Financial System Overcome? However, the path to 2026 is not without hurdles. For the crypto financial system to gain widespread trust, the industry must prioritize product quality and security. User experience needs to become as simple as using a traditional banking app. Moreover, regulatory compliance is non-negotiable. Projects that proactively work within legal frameworks will likely thrive, while others may falter. The focus must remain on building infrastructure that is not only innovative but also reliable and safe for everyone. Your Actionable Insights for the Coming Shift What does this mean for you? As the crypto financial system matures, education becomes your most valuable asset. Start by understanding the basics of trends like tokenization. Follow regulatory developments, as they will signal which areas of crypto are gaining official recognition. For investors, consider diversifying into projects focused on utility—like payment platforms or RWA protocols—rather than speculation alone. The next two years will be crucial for laying the groundwork of a more open and efficient financial future. In conclusion, Coinbase’s 2026 outlook paints a compelling picture of integration. Cryptocurrency is shedding its niche status and preparing to become a fundamental layer of the global crypto financial system . Driven by regulation, institutional adoption, and groundbreaking technology, this transition promises greater financial inclusion and innovation. The message is clear: the future of finance is being built on the blockchain, and it’s arriving sooner than many think. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) What does Coinbase mean by the ‘core financial system’? It refers to everyday banking, payments, asset trading, and lending—the essential services currently dominated by traditional banks and institutions. Crypto aims to integrate into and improve these areas. Why is 2026 seen as a pivotal year? By 2026, key regulatory frameworks, like the EU’s MiCA, will be fully active. Additionally, several years of technological development and institutional testing will have culminated in more mature, widely available products. What is real-world asset (RWA) tokenization? It’s the process of creating a digital token on a blockchain that represents ownership of a physical asset, like real estate or gold. This makes buying, selling, and dividing ownership of such assets easier and faster. How will stablecoins change payments? Stablecoins can settle transactions in seconds for minimal cost, 24/7. This is a major upgrade over current international bank transfers, which can take days and incur high fees. Is this growth guaranteed? No. Coinbase’s outlook is a projection. Its realization depends on continued positive regulatory developments, technological success, and broader economic stability. How should a beginner prepare for these changes? Focus on learning. Use reputable sources to understand blockchain basics, follow major news from established companies like Coinbase, and never invest more than you can afford to lose in this evolving space.

Here’s Why",https://timestabloid.com/you-need-to-hold-at-least-2314-xrp-heres-why/,"Recent shifts in XRP’s wallet distribution are changing what qualifies as meaningful ownership. As the asset trades around $2.04, the number of tokens required to reach higher holder tiers continues to decline, while the financial commitment needed to do so rises steadily. XRP Wallet Distribution According to recent data , the top 10% of XRP holders now includes roughly 739,970 wallets. To enter this group, a wallet must hold at least 2,314 tokens, which translates to an investment of about $4,720 at current market prices. This marks a significant shift compared with previous years. In June 2024, investors needed approximately 3,300 XRP to reach the same tier. At that time, XRP traded near $0.47, putting the total cost at roughly $1,551. By January 2025, the threshold had already fallen to around 2,599 XRP as prices moved higher. Rising prices reduce the number of tokens required to represent a top-tier position, even as the capital required increases. Crypto experts such as Alpha Lions Academy founder Edoardo Farina still believe accumulation is a good idea at current levels . XRP Ownership Remains Highly Concentrated Despite the lower token threshold for the top 10%, XRP ownership remains heavily concentrated at the upper end. The top 1% of wallets consists of about 73,997 addresses, each holding at least 48,930 XRP. At current prices, that exposure is valued at close to $100,000. In total, the XRP network has approximately 7.4 million wallets. The vast majority hold relatively small balances. Around 6 million wallets contain 500 XRP or fewer, while roughly 3.498 million addresses hold no more than 20 XRP. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Regulatory Progress and Institutional Demand The rising financial barrier to entering higher ownership tiers strengthens the case for accumulation. This view is supported by recent regulatory and institutional developments. The company has received conditional approval from the OCC to launch Ripple National Trust Bank. Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse shared his excitement, describing the move as a major step for U.S. expansion and for RLUSD. Commentators believe this approval enhances regulatory credibility and institutional trust across Ripple’s ecosystem. At the same time, XRP exchange-traded funds (ETFs) have recorded strong demand. Inflows are approaching $1 billion, with over 30 days of net inflows since the first launch. Investors looking to capitalize on the current momentum can join the top 10% of XRP holders with just 2,314 tokens. Farina has previously stated that not holding at least 1,000 XRP is insanity . Smart investors will strive to join the top 10% and secure their spot at the top of the XRP ecosystem. Disclaimer : This content is meant to inform and should not be considered financial advice.

56063077,647039,1766188840,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/56063077.jpeg,Quantum Computing Will Trigger A Bitcoin Supply Shock: Michael Saylor,https://bitcoinist.com/quantum-computing-bitcoin-supply-michael-saylor/,"Quantum computing has become a durable risk narrative for Bitcoin. This week, Galaxy Digital head of research Alex Thorn sat down with Strategy executive chairman Michael Saylor addressing the issue, shortly after Saylor posted his own “Bitcoin Quantum Leap” thesis on X. “The Bitcoin Quantum Leap: Quantum computing won’t break Bitcoin—it will harden it. The network upgrades, active coins migrate, lost coins stay frozen. Security goes up. Supply comes down. Bitcoin grows stronger,” Saylor wrote on Dec. 16, 2025. Saylor Doubles Down On Freezing Dormant Bitcoin In Thorn’s interview , Saylor’s argument is less a cryptography lesson than a coordination claim: when a quantum threat is broadly recognized, the response will not be optional, and Bitcoin will follow the same upgrade logic as the rest of the digital economy. “There’s going to be a point when the world will form a consensus that there’s a quantum threat. We’re not there now, but you won’t miss it because the United States government will direct all of the defense contractors to upgrade their encryption algorithms to be quantum resistant,” Saylor said. He described a cascade in which major platforms ship standardized quantum-resistant libraries across consumer devices and core financial systems, with enforced timelines and re-authentication requirements. In that scenario, Saylor suggested, Bitcoin’s transition would be a software upgrade problem, not an existential crisis. “They will ship an upgrade and they will say please install the new client software and reauthenticate yourself. And you’ve got X days, 90 days, 30 days… And if you don’t, we’re going to freeze your funds. For your own good,” Saylor said. Saylor repeatedly returned to incentives as the decisive factor. In his view, owners of meaningful balances will not rationally opt out of an upgrade that preserves access to their holdings, and the same logic extends to the broader ecosystem’s ability to reach rough consensus. “The Bitcoin network just runs on software. There’s going to be a quantum upgrade . It’s going to have quantum resistant encryption libraries,” he said, adding that he would expect those to align with widely adopted standards shipped across operating systems and enterprise infrastructure. Where his answer becomes more explicitly market-relevant is in the downstream implication: coins that can be migrated will be migrated, and coins that cannot be migrated — because the holders are deceased or keys are irretrievable — would remain stranded. Saylor framed that as a security hardening event that also forces a clearer accounting of lost supply. “We’re going to re-encrypt all the Bitcoin and all the wallets […] It’s going to get re-encrypted if the holders of the private keys are alive and if they like money,” he said. “If they’re dead, they’re not going to re-encrypt. And if they’ve lost the keys, they’re not going to re-encrypt.” Bitcoin Supply Shock Imminent That is where the “deflationary event” language enters: the upgrade, in his view, would effectively separate recoverable BTC from unrecoverable BTC in a way the market would have to price. “This is going to be a massive upgrade to network security and it’s going to be a massive deflationary event,” Saylor said. “And we’re going to get the answer to the age old question, how much BTC has been lost ?” Saylor also addressed the common objection that decentralization makes coordinated upgrades impractical. He argued the opposite: decentralized networks still converge when sufficiently motivated, and global supply chains and defense ecosystems coordinate under pressure despite being fragmented across thousands of entities. “You think you’re not going to get consensus? All the smart people with money in the world that thought it was smart to put their money on the crypto network, you think they’re the people too stupid to want to upgrade?” he said. In his framing, the practical difference versus a bank-driven migration is timing. A centralized institution can enforce a short deadline; Bitcoin, because it is global and permissionless, would likely take longer , on the order of months to years, but would still converge. “We’re probably going to do this over the course of 30 days or 90 days. It’ll probably take two years or one year,” Saylor said.

Not so fast, says a legendary trader. Veteran analyst Peter Brandt delivers a sobering reality check, predicting the much-anticipated CLARITY Act will have a surprisingly minimal impact on the Bitcoin price . Let’s unpack his seasoned perspective and what it means for your portfolio. What Did Peter Brandt Actually Say About the Bitcoin Price? In a recent interview, Peter Brandt cut through the hype. He stated that while the proposed U.S. crypto market structure bill is a positive step for regulatory clarity, it is not a fundamental event that will redefine Bitcoin’s core value proposition. Brandt, known for his decades of market experience, views the legislation as necessary housekeeping rather than a revolutionary catalyst. His key takeaway is straightforward: don’t expect a regulatory green light to automatically trigger a massive bull run. The Bitcoin price is driven by a more complex set of factors, including adoption, macroeconomic conditions, and its inherent scarcity. Why Won’t Regulatory Clarity Skyrocket the Market? This perspective might surprise investors who have longed for clear rules. However, Brandt’s reasoning is logical. Here are the core reasons a bill might not move the needle significantly: Bitcoin is Global: The Bitcoin price is set on a global stage. While US regulation is important, it’s just one piece of a worldwide puzzle. It’s About Adoption, Not Just Permission: Clear rules help institutions feel comfortable entering. But the real price driver is actual adoption and use, not just the potential for it. The “Sell the News” Risk: Major events are often anticipated and priced in by the market long before they happen. The actual passage could be a classic “sell the news” moment. Therefore, Brandt suggests the bill’s passage might only slightly soften bearish sentiment rather than ignite a full-blown rally. Connecting the Dots: Brandt’s Previous Bitcoin Price Forecast This isn’t Brandt’s first cautious outlook. To understand his current stance, we must look at his recent analysis. In October, he made a notable comparison, drawing parallels between Bitcoin’s chart patterns and the soybean market of the 1970s. Based on that historical analogy, he predicted a potential correction for the Bitcoin price down to the $60,000 level. This context is crucial. His view on the crypto bill is filtered through a lens of near-term market caution. He’s analyzing legislation not in a vacuum, but within the framework of existing technical and macroeconomic pressures. Actionable Insights for Crypto Investors So, what should you do with this information? Don’t just listen—act wisely. Manage Expectations: Separate regulatory progress from guaranteed price appreciation. They are related but not the same. Focus on Fundamentals: Continue to evaluate Bitcoin’s long-term fundamentals—network security, hash rate, wallet growth—rather than betting solely on political outcomes. Diversify Your Catalysts: Build an investment thesis that includes multiple potential growth drivers, not just US regulation. This approach helps you build a resilient strategy that isn’t derailed by a single political event, regardless of its outcome. The Final Verdict: A Dose of Market Maturity Peter Brandt’s analysis signals a maturing market. The initial phase of crypto was dominated by wild speculation on rumors. Now, seasoned veterans are applying disciplined, long-term thinking. The message is clear: sustainable growth for the Bitcoin price comes from organic adoption and technological utility, not just regulatory checkboxes. While the CLARITY Act is undeniably important for creating a safer, more structured U.S. market, it is a foundation for the future, not a magic wand for today’s prices. Investors should welcome the clarity but temper their immediate expectations. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What is the CLARITY Act? A1: The CLARITY Act is a proposed U.S. bill aimed at creating a clearer regulatory framework for cryptocurrencies and digital asset markets, defining the roles of agencies like the SEC and CFTC. Q2: Why does Peter Brandt think it won’t affect Bitcoin’s price much? A2: Brandt believes Bitcoin’s value is defined by global adoption and its fundamental properties, not solely by U.S. regulation. He sees the bill as necessary infrastructure, not a primary price catalyst. Q3: Does this mean regulation is unimportant for crypto? A3> Not at all. Regulation is crucial for mainstream institutional adoption and consumer protection. Brandt’s point is that its direct, short-term impact on the Bitcoin price may be overstated by the market. Q4: What factors does Brandt think will drive Bitcoin’s price instead? A4> While not detailed in this interview, Brandt’s historical analysis suggests he focuses heavily on market cycles, technical patterns, macroeconomic trends (like inflation), and global adoption rates. Q5: Should I sell my Bitcoin if the bill passes? A5> Brandt’s analysis is a perspective, not direct financial advice. It suggests not buying solely in anticipation of the bill. Your decision should align with your long-term investment strategy and risk tolerance. Share This Reality Check Did this perspective help you separate hype from reality?

Is the crypto winter finally starting to thaw? A key market thermometer, the Crypto Fear & Greed Index , just inched up four points to a score of 20. This subtle shift offers a glimmer of hope, but the reading firmly remains in the “Extreme Fear” zone. For investors navigating these volatile waters, understanding this index is not just helpful—it’s essential for making informed decisions. What Exactly Is the Crypto Fear & Greed Index? Think of the Crypto Fear & Greed Index as the market’s emotional heartbeat. Created by data provider Alternative.me, it quantifies the overall sentiment driving cryptocurrency prices on a scale from 0 to 100. A score of 0 represents “Extreme Fear,” while 100 signals “Extreme Greed.” The current reading of 20, though improved, clearly shows that anxiety still dominates the landscape. This isn’t a simple guess. The index uses a sophisticated blend of data sources to gauge the market’s pulse: Volatility (25%): High price swings often correlate with fear. Market Volume (25%): Spikes in trading can indicate momentum shifts. Social Media (15%): The buzz and tone on platforms like Twitter and Reddit. Surveys (15%): Direct sentiment checks from the community. Bitcoin Dominance (10%): When Bitcoin’s market share grows, it can signal a “flight to safety.” Google Trends (10%): Search volume for terms like “Bitcoin crash.” Why Should You Care About a Score of 20? A move from 16 to 20 on the Crypto Fear & Greed Index might seem small, but in sentiment analysis, direction matters. This uptick suggests that the pervasive doom and gloom may be very slightly receding. Historically, prolonged periods of “Extreme Fear” have often preceded significant market rebounds, as weak hands sell and value investors begin to accumulate. However, caution is paramount. The market remains fragile. This slight improvement could be a temporary respite rather than a definitive trend reversal. Therefore, it’s crucial to view this data as one piece of a larger puzzle, not a standalone buy signal. How Can Traders Use This Information? Savvy market participants watch the Crypto Fear & Greed Index for potential opportunities. Extreme fear can sometimes signal a market bottom, while extreme greed often warns of a top. Here are actionable insights: Contrarian Indicator: When fear is extreme, it may be time to research quality projects for potential long-term entry. Risk Management: A rising index from fear towards neutral could indicate decreasing selling pressure. Avoid Emotional Trading: The index helps you see the crowd’s emotion, allowing you to make more rational decisions. Remember, this tool measures sentiment, not fundamentals. Always combine it with your own research on project viability, technology, and market trends. What’s Next for the Crypto Fear & Greed Index? The road to “Greed” is long. For the Crypto Fear & Greed Index to move significantly higher, we would likely need sustained positive catalysts. These could include clear regulatory progress, strong institutional adoption news, or bullish Bitcoin price action that breaks key resistance levels. Until then, the market mood is likely to remain cautious. Monitoring this index weekly, rather than daily, provides a clearer picture of the underlying sentiment trend, helping you filter out market noise. Conclusion: A Flicker, Not a Flame The recent rise in the Crypto Fear & Greed Index to 20 is a noteworthy, if modest, development. It signals that the overwhelming pessimism might be finding a floor. For investors, this environment demands a balanced approach: cautious optimism paired with rigorous due diligence. The index serves as a valuable compass in the emotional storm of crypto markets, reminding us that the greatest opportunities often arise when fear is at its peak. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q: Where can I check the current Crypto Fear & Greed Index? A: You can find the live index and its historical data on the website of its creator, Alternative.me. Q: Is a score of 20 a good time to buy Bitcoin? A: Not necessarily. While extreme fear can indicate potential buying zones, it is not a timing tool. Always conduct your own analysis and consider your risk tolerance. Q: How often is the index updated? A: The Crypto Fear & Greed Index is typically updated once per day. Q: Does the index apply to altcoins as well as Bitcoin? A> Yes. While Bitcoin dominance is one input, the index is designed to reflect sentiment across the broader cryptocurrency market. Q: Has the index been accurate in the past? A> It has been a reliable gauge of crowd psychology. Major market tops in 2017 and 2021 coincided with “Extreme Greed” readings, while bottoms have often aligned with “Extreme Fear.” Found this breakdown of the Crypto Fear & Greed Index helpful?

The Aster DEX has enjoyed a surge in trading volume thanks to various factors, including the launch of its token in September 2025, the high leverage it offers, and integrated spot/yield strategies. It has emerged as a challenger to top perp DEXs like Hyperliquid, appearing just below Hyperliquid in daily/weekly volume rankings according to data from Defillama. Source: Defillama Aster and Lighter have made significant progress The Aster DEX was endorsed by Changpeng Zhao, and he has publicly disclosed holdings of the token, going as far as shilling its chart. For context, the last time CZ shilled the chart of a token was for BNB when it was sub $50. The Aster token is currently under $1, trading at $0.72, and bull Crypto Twitter bulls claim this is the cheapest it will ever be. However, risks like token unlocks continue to put pressure on the price, and there is a $75 million token unlock happening this week, as reported by Cryptopolitan. Unlike Aster, Lighter has no token yet but was running a points farming campaign until mid-December. The Ethereum L2-based platform has witnessed even more rapid growth compared to Aster and occupies a mid-tier position. According to available data, Lighter currently pulls in a lower volume than Aster and Hyperliquid; however, it has been consistent. That changed briefly in November when it jumped to the top of the perps leaderboard on DefiLlama after raising $68 million in a new funding round led by Peter Thiel’s Founders Fund and Ribbit Capital. The funding round announcement was made just as Lighter pushed to the top of perpetual futures-focused DEXs, outpacing rivals Hyperliquid and Aster. Data from DefiLlama shows that the platform is now the largest decentralized perp exchange by trading volume on the monthly timeframes, with $252 billion in perpetual swaps trading volume, followed by Aster’s $218 billion. Open interest for the DEX has also surged to $1.7 billion, behind Aster’s $2.4 billion and Hyperliquid’s $7 billion. Lighter has made a name for itself as a destination for institutional or smart money flow because of its low latency and gas-efficient order books paired with zk-rollup speed. This means standard accounts on the platform don’t incur taker or maker fees, which allows retail users to trade across all markets without costs. Its points system has also implied there will be an airdrop, which has acted as incentive for traders to use the platform. That could actually backfire as many of those people could simply move on to other platforms after the airdrop, as is often seen. One thing is clear from the metrics – Hyperliquid is the dominant leader in the perps DEX space, as it leads in fundamentals like open interest, TVL, and innovations such as HIP-3 for permissionless listings, HyperEVM and a pending Bitwise ETF filing. It is closely followed by Aster the challenger and Lighter, which is quickly becoming a niche platform with its loyal customer base. Hyperliquid’s success led to new perp DEXs Hyperliquid is the undisputed leader of the perps DEX wars, but it has been losing market share to Aster, Lighter and even EdgeX, the DEX that occupies fourth place on the leaderboard, because of incentives and scalability. Tomas Fanta, principal at crypto investment firm Heartcore, has implied that the launch and success of Hyperliquid is what triggered the competition, causing a “wave of copy-cat perp DEXs” to flood the VC market even though most of them “have zero innovation.” According to Fanta, most pure VC funds — those unable to invest in liquid markets — were sidelined by HYPE’s success, so there is an “opportunity to look for a Hyperliquid contender.” He cautioned, however, that there are no guarantees these attempts succeed, as Hyperliquid’s rise was heavily influenced by its “no-VC” narrative and community reward mechanism. Among the top three, the most likely contender for the top spot in the future is Aster, and it has been marketed as such. However, there has been friction in the Aster community recently with holders complaining of not being rewarded and community members alleging the continuous airdrop campaign is only diluting token value. The biggest issue has become the negative price action, which has persisted in the face of accelerated buybacks, encouraging allegations of the team selling the tokens bought via another wallet. Lighter has also had its own fair share of problems. The platform launched its public mainnet on October 1, after eight months of private beta testing. However, as it launched, it faced a major outage just nine days later during the October 10 market crash, forcing the team to later admit that its systems couldn’t handle the traffic surge and that it would upgrade database capacity. Traders who were affected by the outage, which led to about $50 million in losses, were compensated with “Lighter points” that can be exchanged for a future token airdrop.

DraftKings Predictions is a CFTC regulated platform launched by DraftKings. The platform is available in 38 states and allows trading on sport and financial outcomes. DraftKings launches DraftKings Predictions DraftKings has launched a subsidiary called DraftKings Predictions, directly competing with established prediction platforms like Kalshi and Polymarket in the booming events prediction market. The platform launched in 38 states and competes with existing prediction market platforms like Kalshi and Polymarket. The new platform operates under U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) supervision. DraftKings Prediction s re gistered as a CFTC Introducing Broker and Member of the National Futures Association. The platform intends to initially offer markets in sports and finance before expanding into entertainment and culture categories as the product matures. “DraftKings Predictions is a significant milestone and reflects our ongoing commitment to delivering products that tap into the passion of our customers, ” Co rey Gottlieb, the Chief Product Officer of DraftKings, said . The company plans to take advantage of strategic partnerships with ESPN and NBCUniversal to create what Gottlieb describes as “an authentic, real-time product that moves at the speed of sports.” Sports event contracts are available in states where traditional sports betting remains illegal, including California, Florida, Georgia, and Texas. This is because prediction markets are classified as event contracts under CFTC jurisdiction rather than gambling under state gaming laws. How is DraftKings Predictions different from Kalshi and Polymarket ? Dr aftKings Predictions as at its launch, connects t o CM E Group, one of the world’s largest derivatives exchanges. Kalshi, on the other hand, operates its own CFTC-regulated exchange, and Polymarket operates on blockchain technology, and it became compliant with CFTC registration standards in late 2025. DraftKings Predictions plans to integrate Railbird Technologies Inc. and its subsidiary Railbird Exchange, LLC, which DraftKings recently acquired. This integration is expected to increase the available markets, enable product innovation, and provide economic advantages over time. DraftKings operates sophisticated marketing and analytics systems, has an established customer base of millions of users, and maintains partnerships with major media companies. The company recently implemented a “Responsible Trading program, that allows users to set deposit limits, take cooling-off periods, self-exclude, and access educational materials through the DraftKings Responsible Trading Center within the app. Kalshi became the first prediction market exchange to be regulated by the CFTC in 2021, and gained its popularity through predictions around political events. Polymarket had its time in the spotlight in the 2024 election period, when it capped a period of record activity with accurately predicting President Trump’s victory when most traditional polls had the candidates neck and neck. But it had to weather a few rough months of scaled-up faced regulatory scrutiny for serving U.S. customers without proper registration. DraftKings’ pivot into the prediction markets signals the growing mainstream adoption of such markets, but Kalshi and Polymarket maintain a very healthy lead on many of the new entrants into the sector.

According to Arthur Hayes, co-founder of BitMEX, savvy investors should start to bargain hunt for altcoins right now. While the broader market recovery may be slow, Hayes argues this is precisely the moment for those who understand risk and value to act. Why Does Arthur Hayes Say to Bargain Hunt for Altcoins Now? In a recent essay, Hayes presented a contrarian view. He acknowledges that most altcoins are ailing and a full recovery will take time. However, he stresses that this creates a unique window. Investors skilled in capital preservation and exchange mechanics can find deeply undervalued assets. The key is selective, informed action, not blind speculation. The Macro Trigger: How Federal Policy Could Fuel Recovery Hayes doesn’t base his outlook on hype. He points to a specific macroeconomic catalyst: the U.S. Federal Reserve’s Reserve Management Purchases (RMP). He argues this program is effectively a form of quantitative easing (QE). Once the market fully recognizes this, he believes Bitcoin could see a sharp, significant recovery. A rising Bitcoin tide often lifts the altcoin market, making the current bargain hunt for altcoins a potential pre-emptive move. What Are the Practical Steps to Bargain Hunt? This isn’t a call to buy every cheap coin. Hayes emphasizes a disciplined approach. Here are the core principles for investors looking to bargain hunt for altcoins effectively: Focus on Fundamentals: Look beyond price. Assess the project’s technology, team, tokenomics, and real-world use case. Understand Capital Preservation: Never risk more than you can afford to lose. Position sizing is critical in a volatile market. Master Exchange Mechanics: Know how to navigate liquidity, order books, and potential market manipulations. Be Patient: Recovery is slow. This is an accumulation phase, not a short-term trade. Hayes’s Top Pick: A Closer Look at Ethena (ENA) Hayes puts his money where his mouth is. He specifically named Ethena (ENA) as his most preferred altcoin opportunity. He has personally invested in the project through his family office, Maelstrom. This endorsement highlights his strategy: identifying specific projects with strong potential amidst the broader market weakness. It serves as a case study for how to bargain hunt for altcoins with conviction. Navigating the Challenges of Altcoin Investing This strategy is not without risk. The altcoin market is notoriously volatile and many projects fail. Hayes’s advice is a filter for this noise. The goal isn’t to find the next ‘meme coin’ sensation, but to identify fundamentally sound projects trading at a discount due to overall market sentiment. This disciplined bargain hunt for altcoins separates strategic investors from the crowd. Conclusion: A Strategic Window of Opportunity Arthur Hayes provides a clear, macro-informed thesis. The time to bargain hunt for altcoins is when fear is high and prices are low, not when euphoria returns. By focusing on capital preservation, understanding key market mechanics, and waiting for the macro trigger of Fed policy recognition, investors can position themselves thoughtfully. The recovery may be gradual, but the foundations for the next cycle are being built now by those willing to look closely. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) What does it mean to ‘bargain hunt for altcoins’? It means selectively looking for cryptocurrency projects (other than Bitcoin) that are fundamentally strong but currently trading at prices significantly below their perceived long-term value, often due to negative overall market sentiment. Why is Arthur Hayes bullish now if recovery is slow? Hayes believes the best investment opportunities arise when prices are low and most participants are fearful. A slow recovery allows disciplined investors more time to accumulate quality assets before a potential major upward move. What is the RMP plan Hayes mentions? Reserve Management Purchases (RMP) is a Federal Reserve program. Hayes interprets it as a form of quantitative easing, which increases the money supply and has historically been bullish for hard assets like Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies. Should I just buy any cheap altcoin? Absolutely not. Hayes stresses a selective, research-driven approach. The goal is to find projects with solid fundamentals, not just low prices. Many cheap coins may never recover. What is Ethena (ENA)? Ethena is a specific cryptocurrency project that Hayes has publicly endorsed and invested in. He views it as a prime example of a valuable asset currently available at a bargain price. Is this advice suitable for beginner crypto investors? Hayes’s strategy is geared toward investors who already understand core concepts like capital preservation and exchange mechanics. Beginners should focus on education first before attempting to bargain hunt in volatile markets. Found Arthur Hayes’s strategy for navigating the crypto market insightful?

The Department of War admitted in a fresh report that it’s once again failed to account for what it owns versus what it owes, leaving $4.73 trillion in liabilities towering over its assets. The Pentagon also reiterated that it has pushed its clean audit goal to 2028, when Trump would’ve already been out of office. The largest audit flagged 26 material weaknesses and 2 major deficiencies across financial reporting controls for fiscal year 2025. A material weakness, in government terms, is a giant red flag; proof that errors and misstatements probably won’t be caught in time. And they had 26 of them, meaning there’s no real grip on the Pentagon’s accounting structure. F-35 inventory records not reported The F-35 Joint Strike Fighter program, the Pentagon’s most expensive weapon system, added fuel to the fire. According to the report , the Department failed to include the program’s global spares pool in its financial records. That’s a huge pile of parts, gear, and equipment that nobody properly logged. “Because the DoD is unable to provide or obtain accurate and reliable data to verify the existence, completeness, or value of its Global Spares Pool assets for the Joint Strike Fighter Program, we could not quantify the material misstatement in the DoD’s assets on the Agency-Wide Financial Statements,” the audit document stated. Basically, they don’t know how much of the F-35 stockpile even exists, and even if it does, what it’s worth. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth responded to the report, saying the Pentagon “remains steadfast in its commitment to rigorous annual financial statement audits.” He added that the 2025 audit did show “significant progress,” but the department still has major clean-up to do. The only wins this year? One material weakness was resolved and another one got merged into a broader category. Not a huge turnaround by any means. Jules Hurst, acting comptroller, admitted the department won’t get a clean audit without speeding things up fast. “While we made significant progress in FY 2025, the Department of War will not reach its goal of achieving a clean financial statement audit without a significant acceleration of its efforts,” Hurst wrote in a letter included in the audit. “We will change the trajectory in FY 2026 to rapidly address longstanding issues through a revised strategy and approach.” He added, “The Department of War is committed to resolving its critical issues and achieving an unmodified audit opinion by 2028.” On the same day the audit dropped, the Senate confirmed Michael Powers as the Pentagon’s new comptroller. During his July confirmation hearing, Powers said his team would get to work “within weeks” to figure out clear milestones toward a clean audit, as required under the FY24 National Defense Authorization Act. “The work is underneath: How do we get to a common or a couple of common financial systems,” Powers told lawmakers at the time. All that’s left now is four more audit seasons and trillions of dollars to track. The smartest crypto minds already read our newsletter. Want in?

An analysis of the XRP daily Bollinger Bands suggests the path to recovery is blocked, with a return to that key psychological level looking highly improbable before the year ends. Let’s break down what the charts are telling us and what it means for your portfolio. What Do the XRP Daily Bollinger Bands Reveal? According to a recent report highlighted by U.Today, the XRP daily Bollinger Bands on the XRP/USDT chart are flashing warning signs. The core issue is simple yet significant: the price is consistently trading below the indicator’s middle line. This middle line, typically a 20-period simple moving average, acts as a crucial baseline for momentum. Staying beneath it signals a distinct lack of buying pressure and the capital inflow necessary to fuel a major rally. While it’s premature to declare a full-blown, irreversible downtrend, the current setup heavily discourages optimism for a near-term surge. Why is the $2 Target So Unlikely Right Now? The dream of XRP hitting $2 again in 2024 faces a formidable technical wall. For a true bullish reversal to begin, XRP must first accomplish a critical task: reclaim and hold above the middle line of its daily Bollinger Bands , which currently sits around $0.52. This isn’t just a minor hurdle; it’s the first major step towards changing the narrative. Key Resistance: If the daily trading candle closes below this middle line, the level is expected to transform from a target into a strong zone of technical resistance. This means every attempt to rise could be met with selling pressure. Capital Drought: The analysis points to a fundamental problem—insufficient buying volume. Without a significant influx of capital, XRP lacks the fuel to power through resistance levels and stage a meaningful recovery to higher price points like $2. What Would a Bullish Reversal for XRP Actually Look Like? So, is all hope lost? Not necessarily, but traders need clear signals to shift their perspective. A change in fortune would require a concrete sequence of events on the chart. The most immediate and vital sign would be a strong, high-volume daily close above the Bollinger Bands’ middle line. This action would demonstrate that buyers have finally overwhelmed sellers at this key level, potentially opening the door for a test of the upper band. However, given the current bearish alignment of the XRP daily Bollinger Bands , such a move is not on the immediate horizon and would require a substantial shift in market sentiment. Actionable Insights for XRP Traders and Holders Facing this technical reality, what should you do? First, manage expectations. Banking on a $2 XRP price before year-end based on current chart data is a highly speculative gamble. Second, watch for confirmation. Don’t anticipate the breakout; wait for it to happen. A sustained move above the $0.52 middle line with increasing volume would be the first technical green light. Until then, the bearish trend indicated by the squeezing bands and low position suggests caution is the prudent approach. Consider this a period for observation rather than aggressive accumulation. In summary, the message from the XRP daily Bollinger Bands is clear and cautious. The technical setup severely limits the likelihood of a Cinderella run to $2 in the remaining months of the year. The asset is trapped in a bearish phase, needing to overcome significant resistance just to begin a recovery narrative. For now, the charts advise patience, highlighting the $0.52 level as the most important line in the sand for any future bullish hopes. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q: What are Bollinger Bands, and why are they important for XRP? A: Bollinger Bands are a technical analysis tool that plots volatility bands above and below a moving average. For XRP, they help visualize volatility and identify potential overbought or oversold conditions, with the middle line acting as a key momentum indicator. Q: Does the bearish signal from the daily Bollinger Bands mean XRP will keep falling? A> Not necessarily. It indicates a high probability of continued bearish pressure or consolidation in the near term. It is a warning sign, not a guaranteed prediction of future price. Q: What price does XRP need to break to change this bearish outlook? A> The primary level to watch is the middle line of the daily Bollinger Bands, currently around $0.52. A decisive, high-volume close above this level is the first technical requirement for a potential trend change. Q: Should I sell my XRP based on this analysis? A> This is not financial advice. Technical analysis is one of many tools. This analysis suggests managing expectations for a rapid $2 recovery. Your decision should be based on your own research, investment strategy, and risk tolerance. Q: Can external news change this technical picture for XRP? A> Absolutely. Major news like positive regulatory developments or significant partnership announcements can override technical indicators in the short term by drastically shifting market sentiment and capital flows. Q: How often should I check the XRP daily Bollinger Bands? A> For swing or position traders, checking the daily chart at the close of the trading day is sufficient. The daily timeframe filters out market noise and provides a clearer picture of the prevailing trend. Found this breakdown of the XRP daily Bollinger Bands insightful?

That’s the staggering potential outlined by digital asset giant Grayscale. In a recent analysis, the firm stated the tokenized asset market has the runway to grow approximately one thousand times its current size by the end of this decade. This isn’t just speculation; it’s a forecast based on the fundamental digitization of global value. What does this mean for investors and the future of finance? Let’s unpack the data and the driving forces behind this projected seismic shift. What Exactly Is the Tokenized Asset Market Today? To understand the scale of the predicted growth, we must first grasp the starting point. Grayscale notes that tokenized real-world assets (RWAs)—like stocks, bonds, real estate, and commodities represented on a blockchain—currently represent a mere 0.01% of the global stock and bond markets. This minuscule fraction highlights the immense, untapped potential. The current tokenized asset market is a proof-of-concept phase, with pioneering projects demonstrating efficiency and accessibility gains. However, widespread adoption awaits key developments in two critical areas. What Will Fuel This 1,000x Explosion in Growth? Grayscale identifies two primary catalysts for the market’s expansion: mature blockchain infrastructure and clear regulatory frameworks. Think of it as building the highways before the traffic arrives. Infrastructure Maturation: Networks need to handle massive scale, security, and low-cost transactions seamlessly. Regulatory Clarity: Governments must establish rules that protect investors without stifling innovation, giving institutions the confidence to participate. As these pillars solidify, the floodgates could open for trillions in traditional finance value to migrate on-chain. This transition is not about replacing old systems but creating a more efficient, transparent, and accessible layer for global assets. Which Blockchain Networks Will Benefit Most? This historic shift won’t happen in a vacuum. It will drive profound activity across several leading blockchain ecosystems. Grayscale specifically pointed to networks like Ethereum (ETH), BNB Chain (BNB), Solana (SOL), and Avalanche (AVAX) as primary beneficiaries. Each offers unique advantages for tokenization, such as high security, scalability, or specialized subnets. Furthermore, key middleware protocols like Chainlink (LINK), which connect blockchains to real-world data, will become indispensable infrastructure. The growth of the tokenized asset market is, therefore, a rising tide that could lift many boats across the crypto ecosystem. What Are the Real-World Benefits and Hurdles? The promise of tokenization is compelling, but the path has obstacles. On the benefit side, tokenization can: Increase Liquidity: Make traditionally illiquid assets like real estate or fine art easier to buy and sell in fractions. Reduce Costs: Automate processes through smart contracts, cutting out intermediaries. Enhance Transparency: Provide a clear, immutable record of ownership and transaction history. However, significant challenges remain. These include navigating a complex global regulatory patchwork, ensuring robust cybersecurity, and achieving seamless integration with legacy financial systems. Overcoming these hurdles is crucial for the tokenized asset market to reach its forecasted potential. Conclusion: A New Financial Era on the Horizon Grayscale’s 1,000x growth projection for the tokenized asset market is more than a bold number—it’s a vision for a fundamentally upgraded financial system. While the timeline to 2030 is ambitious, the direction is clear. The convergence of technological readiness and regulatory evolution is setting the stage for the largest migration of value in history onto blockchain rails. For forward-looking investors and builders, understanding this megatrend is no longer optional; it’s essential to navigating the next decade of digital finance. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) What does ‘tokenized asset’ mean? A tokenized asset is a real-world item like a share of stock, a bond, or a piece of property that has been digitally represented on a blockchain. This digital token acts as a proof of ownership and can be traded or divided. Why does Grayscale think the market can grow 1,000x? The prediction is based on the current tiny market size (0.01% of traditional markets) and the expectation that blockchain technology will mature and regulations will become clearer, unlocking massive institutional and mainstream adoption. Is my investment safe in tokenized assets? Like any emerging technology, risks exist, including regulatory uncertainty and technical vulnerabilities. Safety will increase as the infrastructure matures and comprehensive regulations are established. Always conduct thorough research. Which assets are most likely to be tokenized first? We are already seeing tokenization of treasury bonds, real estate funds, and private equity. Highly regulated, liquid assets like government bonds and blue-chip stocks are likely candidates for early large-scale adoption. How can an average person invest in this trend? Currently, access is often through specialized platforms or crypto exchanges offering tokenized products. As the market grows, more traditional investment avenues like ETFs may provide exposure. Consulting a financial advisor familiar with digital assets is recommended. Did this analysis of the future tokenized asset market help you see the bigger picture?

Shiba Inu is again making headlines after a decline, although recent figures seem to indicate stabilization and not a crash. On the other hand, capital flows are rotating towards projects at an early stage where pricing asymmetry is common. Such an aspect has brought attention towards the best crypto to buy now as investors rethink the best crypto to invest in when faced with such a condition. In this line, a presale crypto at $0.035 has received significant attention as the best crypto to buy now. Shiba Inu Stabilization After Panic Selling Current market trends illustrate Shiba Inu is currently close to a local floor after enduring an extended period of decline. While sales continue, they are not as aggressive, with price compression instead of the initial steep fall. It is essential to note that market information illustrates SHIB has not eroded its liquidity, as it is still being traded on prominent platforms with adequate volumes. There has been purchasing traction at the current price levels, making adverse acceleration less probable. While there is little impetus on the upside, this positive sentiment has eased panicky selling pressures. As such, investors are currently reassessing the new cryptos to buy, including those beyond Shiba Inu, chiefly in search of optimal growth asymmetry. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Presale Continues The focus is also on Mutuum Finance (MUTM) , where the presale is now at a critical level. Phase 6 is about 98% full, and sales are happening fast as there is a sense of urgency. The price for the ongoing Phase 6 is $0.035, indicating a price jump of 250%, or 3.5 times, the price seen during Phase 1, where it was priced at $0.01. Overall, since the presale started, a sum of $19,500,000 has been accumulated, and there are also a cumulative 18,530 MUTM holders. Phase 6 is selling out fast, and the opportunity for purchases at this price is limited. Phase 7 will be live immediately after sell-out, marking a forthcoming price rise by about a near 20% price rise to $0.04, along with a launch price set at $0.06. Based on expectations, purchasers are set to see a 420% ROI. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) – Utility and Development Project updates continue to instill continued confidence in Mutuum Finance (MUTM). The team announced the launch of V1 protocol, which will go live on the Sepolia testnet in Q4 2025, with the focus finalized on liquidity pools, mtTokens, debt tokens, and the liquidator bot, with the supported assets to be ETH and USDT. Security continues to be top of the agenda, with an independent security audit currently in progress, and Mutuum’s lending and borrowing contracts currently under review by Halborn Security. The code lock ensures a lower risk of execution while the initial users take the first steps to explore the best cryptocurrency to invest in now. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Engagement & Incentive Structure Community engagement has driven presale momentum thus far. A recently integrated tool offers a real-time leaderboard displaying the top 50 holders. The 24-Hour Leaderboard offers rewards for engagement, awarding the #1 ranked user a $500 MUTM reward each day they make a transaction. The leaderboard renews each day at 00:00 UTC, keeping the competitive spirit alive. As a further promotion, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is holding a $100,000 giveaway, awarding ten lucky winners a prize of $10,000 in MUTM, keeping the awareness active in the presale phase, while investors consider it as the best cryptocurrency to invest in now relative to the slow-moving giants in the market. The market behavior is also a timely reminder that timing is everything. Shiba Inu has stabilized, but its potential for growth is limited compared to the early DeFi exposure of MUTM. Alternatives exist in terms of MUTM, which is almost sold out in Phase 6 and is therefore the last chance to buy at $0.035 before the price increment. Investors considering what crypto to buy now are looking at areas of convergence when it comes to price, progress, and rewards. This is definitely an opportunity that aligns perfectly.

56063470,647040,1766192401,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/56063470.jpeg,"‘Capital Is Moving, Not Leaving’: What Japan’s Crypto Market Stands To Gain",https://bitcoinist.com/capital-moving-not-leaving-japan-crypto-market-gain/,"The crypto market is entering a phase marked by rising uncertainty and persistent selling pressure, as major assets struggle to regain bullish momentum. Bitcoin remains capped below the $90,000 level, repeatedly failing to attract enough demand to flip resistance into support. At the same time, Ethereum is experiencing heightened volatility and renewed selling pressure, reflecting broader risk aversion across the market. Sentiment has weakened, and price action suggests that investors are becoming increasingly selective rather than aggressively positioning for upside. However, according to an analysis by XWIN Research Japan, the most important shift currently unfolding in crypto is not visible directly in price charts but in how and where capital is being positioned. On-chain data shows that global liquidity within the crypto ecosystem has not exited the market. Instead, it has changed form. The total supply of ERC20-based stablecoins has expanded to approximately $160 billion, hovering near all-time highs. While this supply briefly contracted during the risk-off environment of 2022, it has since resumed a clear and sustained upward trend. This behavior does not signal capital fleeing crypto. Rather, it reflects funds temporarily de-risking while remaining fully inside the ecosystem. Capital is accumulating in stablecoins as “waiting liquidity,” positioned on the sidelines and ready to be deployed once clearer directional signals emerge. Liquidity has not disappeared; it is simply paused, patient, and awaiting conviction. Japan’s Strategic Position in the Global Capital Shift The analysis also highlights that this shift in global capital behavior carries meaningful implications for Japan’s crypto market. As regulatory clarity improves and tax frameworks gradually become more accommodating, Japan is positioned to benefit from a return of domestic capital that has remained cautious in recent years. Combined with renewed interest from individual investors, this re-entry of sidelined capital could deepen local liquidity, improve price discovery, and strengthen Japan’s role within the broader global crypto landscape. A key element in this transition is the growing relevance of JPYC, Japan’s yen-denominated stablecoin. While US dollar–based stablecoins continue to dominate global crypto flows, a yen-native digital currency offers Japan a strategic differentiator. JPYC is not limited to speculative trading use cases; it is increasingly viewed as an infrastructure layer capable of supporting real economic activity. This includes integration with Web3 services, as well as domestic and cross-border payment applications that align more closely with Japan’s existing financial systems. Looking ahead, the report suggests Japan’s crypto market may gradually shift away from a narrow focus on short-term price speculation. Instead, it could evolve into an ecosystem where capital actively circulates and is deployed for practical use cases. Ultimately, how effectively Japan absorbs and channels this globally mobile liquidity will play a central role in defining the market’s next phase of growth. Crypto Market Tests Structural Support Amid Broad Risk-Off Sentiment The total cryptocurrency market capitalization is showing clear signs of structural stress after failing to sustain momentum above recent highs. As the weekly chart highlights, total market cap has retraced toward the $2.9–$3.0 trillion zone, an area that now acts as a critical inflection point for the broader market. This level coincides with the rising 100-week and 200-week moving averages, reinforcing its importance as medium- to long-term support. The rejection from the $4 trillion region marks a decisive shift in market structure. After an extended expansion phase through 2024 and early 2025, the market has entered a corrective regime characterized by lower highs and weakening upside follow-through. Volume behavior supports this interpretation: selling pressure has increased during down weeks, while rebound attempts have been met with comparatively muted participation. Despite the pullback, the long-term trend has not fully broken. The market remains well above the 2022–2023 base, suggesting this move resembles a consolidation or valuation reset rather than a full structural collapse. However, continued trading below the short-term moving averages indicates that risk appetite remains subdued. For the bullish structure to reassert itself, the total market cap must stabilize above the $3 trillion threshold and reclaim the mid-range resistance near $3.3–$3.5 trillion. Failure to hold current support would expose the market to a deeper retracement toward the $2.4–$2.6 trillion region, where stronger historical demand previously emerged.

According to Galaxy Digital’s research team, the answer might be a resounding yes. Their latest forecast suggests we could witness a new Bitcoin all-time high as soon as 2025, with even more ambitious targets on the horizon. This analysis comes from one of the most respected institutional voices in digital assets, making it particularly noteworthy for investors and enthusiasts alike. What’s Driving the Optimism for a Bitcoin All-Time High? Galaxy Research, the analytical division of Galaxy Digital, recently released their annual prediction report with some eye-catching projections. They maintain that despite market uncertainties, the potential for Bitcoin to achieve a new all-time high next year remains valid. This isn’t just casual speculation—it’s a carefully considered outlook from professionals who analyze cryptocurrency markets daily. The report specifically mentions Bitcoin could reach $250,000 by the end of 2027. While they acknowledge the inherent uncertainty in such long-term predictions, their confidence stems from several fundamental factors: Institutional adoption continuing to accelerate Bitcoin’s fixed supply becoming more relevant as adoption grows Macroeconomic conditions that historically favor hard assets Technological improvements to Bitcoin’s ecosystem How Realistic Are These Bitcoin Price Predictions? When any firm predicts a new Bitcoin all-time high, experienced investors naturally question the methodology. Galaxy Digital’s analysis appears grounded in both technical and fundamental approaches. They’re not simply extrapolating past performance but considering how Bitcoin’s role in the global financial system is evolving. What makes this forecast particularly interesting is the timing. A 2025 Bitcoin all-time high would represent a significant acceleration from previous market cycles. However, Galaxy Research suggests that several converging factors could make this timeline plausible, including regulatory clarity and broader acceptance of Bitcoin as a legitimate asset class. The Stablecoin Revolution: Another Key Insight Beyond Bitcoin predictions, Galaxy’s report contains another crucial revelation about stablecoins. They project that stablecoin transaction volume will surpass that of the U.S. Automated Clearing House (ACH) system by 2026. This isn’t a distant possibility—stablecoin volume has already exceeded major credit card networks like Visa and currently sits at half the level of ACH transactions. This growth trajectory matters because: It demonstrates real-world cryptocurrency adoption beyond speculation Stablecoins are becoming critical infrastructure for global payments The upcoming Genius Act implementation in early 2026 will likely accelerate adoption What This Means for Crypto Investors If Galaxy Digital’s predictions prove accurate, we’re entering a transformative period for digital assets. A new Bitcoin all-time high in 2025 would represent more than just price appreciation—it would signal mainstream validation of cryptocurrency’s role in modern finance. For investors, this underscores the importance of maintaining a long-term perspective rather than reacting to short-term volatility. However, it’s crucial to remember that all predictions involve uncertainty. While Galaxy Digital’s analysis is respected, market conditions can change rapidly. The key takeaway isn’t the specific price target but the underlying thesis: institutional analysts see strong fundamentals supporting continued Bitcoin growth. Conclusion: A Bullish Vision for Bitcoin’s Future Galaxy Digital’s forecast paints an optimistic picture for Bitcoin’s trajectory toward a new all-time high. Their dual focus on Bitcoin’s price potential and stablecoin adoption growth provides a comprehensive view of where digital assets might be heading. While predictions should always be approached with measured optimism, this analysis from a major institutional player offers valuable perspective for anyone interested in cryptocurrency’s future. The possibility of witnessing a Bitcoin all-time high in 2025, followed by continued growth toward $250,000, represents one of the more bullish institutional outlooks currently available. Combined with the projected explosion in stablecoin usage, we may be witnessing the early stages of cryptocurrency’s transition from alternative asset to financial mainstream. Frequently Asked Questions What exactly is Galaxy Digital predicting for Bitcoin? Galaxy Digital’s research arm forecasts that Bitcoin could reach a new all-time high in 2025, with a potential price target of $250,000 by the end of 2027. How reliable are these cryptocurrency predictions? While Galaxy Digital is a respected institutional voice, all market predictions involve uncertainty. Their analysis is based on current data and trends, but investors should consider multiple perspectives. What are stablecoins and why do they matter? Stablecoins are cryptocurrencies pegged to stable assets like the US dollar. Galaxy predicts their transaction volume will surpass the entire US ACH system by 2026, indicating massive adoption. Should I invest based on this prediction? Investment decisions should be based on your individual financial situation, risk tolerance, and research. Predictions from analysts can inform your research but shouldn’t be the sole basis for investment choices. What is the Genius Act mentioned in the report? The Genius Act is upcoming legislation expected to provide clearer regulatory frameworks for stablecoins, potentially accelerating their adoption when implemented in early 2026. How does this prediction compare to previous Bitcoin cycles? A 2025 all-time high would represent an accelerated timeline compared to some previous cycles, suggesting potentially different market dynamics are at play. Found this analysis insightful?

Brandt’s technical analysis focused squarely on chart behavior rather than sentiment, warning that the current setup carries downside implications that traders cannot ignore and must deal with. Peter Brandt Calls Out A Potential Double Top Taking to the social media platform X, Brandt highlighted what he described as a potential double top forming on XRP’s weekly chart. He acknowledged upfront that the pattern could still fail but stressed that, as things stand, the structure leans bearish. Related Reading: Analyst Says This XRP Level Is Keeping Downside Pressure In Check The analysis is based on XRP’s recent price action, which has lost the $2 price level after days of consistent bearish price action in December. Brandt framed the setup as a matter of accepting what the chart is showing rather than arguing against it, bluntly stating that market participants need to deal with the implications instead of dismissing them. His remarks were also directed at persistent XRP optimists, making it clear that his stance is not driven by bias against the asset but by adherence to classical chart principles. Until price action invalidates the pattern, the risk profile is tilted to the downside, and XRP might continue pushing downwards in the near term. “Love it or not — you need to deal with it,” Brandt said. The chart accompanying Brandt’s post shows XRP falling below the support of a flag pattern a few months ago. This breakdown has continued to the lower boundary around $1.80 to $2.00, which has acted as an important support pair against a resistance around $3.5. This support level has acted as a critical support region two times already this year. However, XRP looks like it might be losing this level now at the third time of asking. The weekly moving averages on the chart also appear to be flattening, a sign that upside strength has weakened compared to earlier phases of the cycle. What Would Change The Bearish Outlook A double top pattern is a bearish reversal signal, meaning an uptrend is likely ending and a downtrend is beginning. However, despite his firm tone, Brandt was careful to note that the pattern is conditional, not absolute. “This is a potential double top. Sure, it may fail, and I will deal with this if it does,” he said. Related Reading: XRP Price Falls To Critical Support Level, Is It Time To Panic? A sustained move back above the support at $2 would delay any breakdown into the $1 range. A further sustained reclaim of highs around $2.2, $2.5, $2.7, and $3 would invalidate the double top and force a reassessment of the broader trend. However, until such happens, Brandt’s technical structure continues to favor caution that many XRP proponents might not agree with.

Despite high expectations for institutional adoption, crypto hedge funds are posting their worst performance since the 2022 bear market, according to Bloomberg analysis. This unexpected downturn challenges the narrative that clearer regulations and White House policies would guarantee success. Why Are Crypto Hedge Funds Struggling in 2024? The data reveals a sobering picture. Directional trading funds focused on predicting market movements have recorded negative 2.5% returns year-to-date. This represents their poorest performance since the depths of the crypto winter. The situation appears even more challenging for altcoin-focused strategies, which have suffered approximately negative 23% returns. Several factors contribute to this underperformance: Increased institutional competition weakening traditional advantages The October 10th market drop exposing structural vulnerabilities Changing market dynamics that favor different investment approaches Which Investment Strategies Are Actually Working? While directional funds struggle, market-neutral approaches tell a different story. These strategies have achieved impressive returns of around 14.4% year-to-date. The divergence highlights how 2024’s market conditions reward specific approaches while punishing others. Market-neutral funds typically employ strategies like: Arbitrage between different exchanges Statistical pairs trading Delta-neutral options strategies This performance gap suggests that simple directional bets on cryptocurrency prices no longer guarantee success, even for professional crypto hedge funds . How Are Hedge Funds Adapting to Market Challenges? In response to these challenges, many funds are implementing significant strategic shifts. Risk management has become the priority, with managers reducing exposure to volatile altcoins. Instead, they’re strengthening their focus on more predictable opportunities. The current adaptation strategies include: Reduced altcoin exposure to minimize volatility risk Increased DeFi focus for yield-generating opportunities Enhanced risk frameworks to withstand market shocks Diversification across different cryptocurrency strategies These changes reflect a maturation in how crypto hedge funds approach the market, moving from speculative trading toward more sustainable investment practices. What Does This Mean for the Future of Crypto Investing? The current performance data signals an important evolution in cryptocurrency markets. The influx of institutional capital has fundamentally changed the competitive landscape. Traditional hedge fund advantages are diminishing as more sophisticated players enter the space. This development suggests several future trends: Continued pressure on simple directional strategies Growth in sophisticated, quantitative approaches Increased importance of risk management frameworks Greater focus on sustainable yield generation The struggle of crypto hedge funds in 2024 serves as a valuable lesson for all cryptocurrency investors. It demonstrates that professional management doesn’t guarantee success in volatile markets. The data clearly shows that strategy selection and risk management matter more than ever. Frequently Asked Questions What exactly are crypto hedge funds? Crypto hedge funds are investment funds that pool capital from accredited investors to trade cryptocurrencies using various strategies. They aim to generate returns regardless of market direction through sophisticated trading approaches. Why are directional trading strategies underperforming? Directional strategies rely on correctly predicting market movements. Increased institutional participation and changing market dynamics have made price prediction more challenging, reducing the effectiveness of these approaches. What makes market-neutral strategies successful? Market-neutral strategies profit from relative price movements between assets rather than overall market direction. This approach can generate returns in both rising and falling markets, providing more consistent performance. How are hedge funds changing their altcoin exposure? Many funds are reducing their altcoin allocations due to high volatility and concentrating on more established cryptocurrencies. They’re also implementing stricter risk controls for any remaining altcoin positions. Will this trend continue throughout 2024? While current conditions favor market-neutral approaches, cryptocurrency markets remain dynamic. Successful crypto hedge funds will likely continue adapting their strategies based on evolving market conditions. What should individual investors learn from this? Individual investors should recognize that professional management doesn’t eliminate risk. Diversification, risk management, and understanding different strategy types remain crucial for success in cryptocurrency investing. Found this analysis of crypto hedge funds insightful?

The startup, founded by former Splunk executives, is pioneering autonomous site reliability engineering technology that could revolutionize how companies maintain their software systems. This funding milestone represents one of the most significant AI infrastructure investments of the year. Resolve AI’s Revolutionary Approach to System Maintenance Resolve AI is developing what they call an “autonomous SRE” – a tool that automatically maintains software systems without human intervention. While traditional site reliability engineers manually troubleshoot and resolve system failures, Resolve AI’s technology autonomously identifies, diagnoses, and resolves production issues in real-time. This addresses a critical challenge for modern companies: as software systems become more complex and distributed across cloud infrastructure, organizations struggle to find and retain enough skilled SREs to keep systems running smoothly. The Series A Funding That’s Making Waves The Series A round was led by Lightspeed Venture Partners, according to sources familiar with the deal. What makes this funding particularly interesting is its structure: while the headline valuation stands at $1 billion, the company’s actual blended valuation was lower due to a multi-tranched investment approach. In this setup, investors purchased some equity at the $1 billion valuation but acquired the remainder – likely a larger percentage of the round – at a lower price. This novel investment structure has recently become popular for the most sought-after AI startups. Resolve AI Funding Timeline Funding Round Amount Lead Investor Notable Participants Timing Seed Round $35 million Greylock Fei-Fei Li, Jeff Dean October 2023 Series A Undisclosed Lightspeed Venture Partners Multiple investors Current Why Autonomous SRE Technology Matters Now The timing for Resolve AI’s technology couldn’t be better. Companies face several critical challenges that autonomous SRE solutions address: Skills Shortage: There’s a severe shortage of qualified SRE professionals in the market System Complexity: Modern software architectures are becoming increasingly distributed and complex Cost Pressure: Manual system maintenance is expensive and inefficient Dowtime Costs: System failures can cost companies millions in lost revenue The Visionary Founders Behind Resolve AI The startup is led by former Splunk executive Spiros Xanthos and Mayank Agarwal, Splunk’s former chief architect for observability. Their partnership dates back 20 years to their graduate studies at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign. This isn’t their first successful collaboration – they previously co-founded Omnition, a startup that was acquired by Splunk in 2019. Their deep experience in observability and system monitoring gives them unique insights into the problems Resolve AI aims to solve. How Does Resolve AI Compare to Competitors? Resolve AI isn’t alone in the autonomous SRE space. The startup competes with Traversal, another AI SRE startup that recently raised a $48 million Series A led by Kleiner Perkins with participation from Sequoia. However, Resolve AI’s approach appears to be gaining significant traction, as evidenced by their impressive Series A valuation and backing from top-tier investors like Lightspeed Venture Partners. The Business Metrics Behind the Billion-Dollar Valuation According to sources, Resolve AI’s annual recurring revenue (ARR) is approximately $4 million. While this might seem modest compared to the $1 billion valuation, investors are clearly betting on the company’s growth potential and the massive market opportunity for autonomous SRE solutions. The exact size of the Series A funding round couldn’t be learned, but it’s clearly substantial enough to warrant the attention it’s receiving. What This Means for the Future of System Reliability The success of Resolve AI’s Series A funding signals a major shift in how companies approach system maintenance. As AI continues to advance, we can expect to see more automation in areas traditionally handled by human experts. The benefits of autonomous SRE technology are compelling: Reduced Downtime: Automated systems can respond to issues faster than humans Lower Operational Costs: Automation reduces the need for large SRE teams Increased Engineering Productivity: Teams can focus on building new features rather than firefighting 24/7 Coverage: AI systems don’t need sleep or breaks Frequently Asked Questions Who are the founders of Resolve AI? Resolve AI was founded by former Splunk executives Spiros Xanthos and Mayank Agarwal. Their partnership dates back to their graduate studies at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign. What investors are backing Resolve AI? The Series A round was led by Lightspeed Venture Partners . Previous investors include Greylock , with participation from Fei-Fei Li and Jeff Dean from Google DeepMind. How does Resolve AI’s technology work? Resolve AI develops autonomous site reliability engineering tools that automatically identify, diagnose, and resolve production issues in real-time, reducing the need for manual intervention by human SREs. What is the company’s current valuation? Resolve AI has achieved a headline valuation of $1 billion with its Series A funding, though the actual blended valuation is lower due to the multi-tranched investment structure. Who are Resolve AI’s main competitors? The main competitor is Traversal, another AI SRE startup that recently raised $48 million in Series A funding led by Kleiner Perkins . The Transformative Potential of Autonomous SRE Resolve AI’s $1 billion Series A valuation represents more than just another funding milestone – it signals a fundamental shift in how we think about system reliability. As software continues to eat the world, the systems that power our digital infrastructure are becoming too complex for humans to manage alone. Autonomous SRE technology offers a compelling solution to this growing challenge, promising to make our digital infrastructure more resilient, efficient, and cost-effective. The backing from Lightspeed Venture Partners and other top investors validates not just Resolve AI’s approach, but the entire category of autonomous system management. As companies continue to struggle with system complexity and talent shortages, solutions like Resolve AI’s will become increasingly essential. This funding round positions the company at the forefront of what could become one of the most important technology trends of the coming decade.

The exchange says those matters should be regulated by the federal Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), not by state gaming authorities. According to Coinbase, prediction market contracts are derivatives that fall under the Commodity Exchange Act, and Congress gave the CFTC the power to police those markets. The company is seeking declaratory and injunctive relief to prevent what it calls a patchwork of state rules that could bar federally approved products from reaching consumers. Paul Grewal, Coinbase’s chief legal officer, has pushed that argument publicly. Today @coinbase filed lawsuits in CT, MI, and IL to confirm what is clear: prediction markets fall squarely under the jurisdiction of the @CFTC , not any individual state gaming regulator (let alone 50). State efforts to control or outright block these markets stifle innovation… — paulgrewal.eth (@iampaulgrewal) December 19, 2025 Why States Stepped In Reports have disclosed that some states have already acted. Connecticut’s regulators issued cease-and-desist orders to platforms such as Kalshi, Robinhood, and Crypto.com, saying certain event contracts look like unlicensed sports betting under state law. Those actions helped trigger the wider legal fight as firms say they operate under federal rules. Coinbase is not only arguing in court. The exchange plans to offer event-contract trading to US users through a partnership with Kalshi, a CFTC-regulated platform, with a rollout targeted for January 2026. That timetable is one reason Coinbase says it needs a clear federal ruling now, to avoid being blocked in some states after launching. Market Reaction And Context The move comes amid a broader tug-of-war over whether prediction markets are financial products or gambling. Kalshi has faced similar fights in several states, and courts have issued mixed rulings so far. Market watchers say the outcome here could decide whether federally approved event contracts are available nationwide or must be treated state-by-state. The litigation also landed in investors’ view. Coinbase’s shares fell more than 10% at one point on the same day the suits were filed, though trading moves were also tied to wider swings in crypto prices. Reports link the stock change to both the news and underlying market trends. If federal judges back Coinbase, the ruling could reinforce CFTC authority and make it easier for platforms regulated at the federal level to operate across state lines. If judges side with the states, companies may face licensing needs in multiple places or be forced to restrict certain contracts in some jurisdictions.

Ethereum Exchange Netflow Has Been Red For The Past Week As pointed out by institutional DeFi solutions provider Sentora in a new post on X, Ethereum has seen net outflows from exchanges in the past week. The indicator of relevance here is the “Exchange Netflow,” which measures the net amount of ETH that’s moving into or out of wallets connected with centralized exchanges. When the value of this metric is positive, it means the investors are depositing a net number of tokens to these platforms. As one of the main reasons why holders deposit their coins to exchanges is for selling-related purposes, this kind of trend can be bearish for the asset’s price. Related Reading: Bitcoin & Ethereum Diverge: Longs Dominate BTC, While ETH Shorts Rise On the other hand, the indicator being below zero suggests outflows are dominating the inflows on exchanges. Such a trend can be a sign that investors are in a phase of accumulation, which can naturally be bullish for the cryptocurrency. As the data shared by Sentora shows, Ethereum has seen a weekly Exchange Netflow value of -$978.45 million, indicating that traders have made a massive amount of net withdrawals. The significant outflows have come as Ethereum has witnessed a decline during the past week. As Sentora explains: This signals aggressive accumulation where investors are likely “buying the dip” and withdrawing assets to cold storage or on-chain environments, tightening the liquid supply despite the negative price momentum. Related Reading: Ethereum Risks Slide To $2,000 If December Closes Below This Level: Analyst The price drawdown in the past week has also accompanied a drop in the total transaction fees on the network, meaning that transfer activity has gone down. The blockchain saw about $2.64 million in fees over the last week, which is more than 15% down week-over-week. ETH Saw A Brief Visit Under $2,800 Before Rebounding Ethereum observed a decline to $2,780 on Thursday, but the asset was able to bounce back as it’s now floating just under $3,000. Interestingly, ETH’s bottom was around the same level as a major on-chain supply cluster, as a chart shared by analyst Ali Martinez in an X post shows. In the graph, Martinez has attached the data of the Ethereum UTXO Realized Price Distribution (URPD) from on-chain analytics firm Glassnode. This metric basically tells us how much ETH supply was last transacted at the various price levels that the coin has visited in its history. There is a huge supply zone located at $2,772 on the URPD, suggesting a large amount of investors have their cost basis at it. Generally, such levels act as a support boundary during downtrends, as traders who purchased there buy the dip to defend it.

This massive movement of 2,509 BTC over just 13 hours has sent ripples through the cryptocurrency community, sparking intense speculation about what it means for Bitcoin’s future price action. What Does This Massive Bitcoin Whale Activity Reveal? On-chain analyst EmberCN first spotted this extraordinary transaction pattern. Three separate wallets, each withdrawing exactly 836.4 BTC (worth approximately $73.58 million), executed their moves in precise four-hour intervals. This clockwork precision strongly suggests a single entity controls all three wallets, making this one of the most significant coordinated Bitcoin whale movements recently observed. The timing of these withdrawals is particularly intriguing. They occurred during what many consider a price dip period for Bitcoin. Therefore, this activity could signal that deep-pocketed investors or institutions have begun accumulating Bitcoin at what they perceive as attractive prices. When a Bitcoin whale makes moves of this magnitude, the entire market pays attention. Why Should Crypto Investors Care About Whale Movements? Whale transactions serve as crucial market indicators for several reasons. First, they represent substantial capital flows that can influence market sentiment and liquidity. Second, the patterns often reveal institutional strategies before they become apparent through traditional channels. Market Sentiment Gauge : Large accumulations during dips typically signal confidence in future price appreciation Liquidity Impact : Removing $221 million worth of Bitcoin from an exchange reduces immediate selling pressure Strategic Timing : The coordinated, timed withdrawals suggest a deliberate accumulation strategy Institutional Patterns Identical transaction amounts and intervals mirror institutional rather than retail behavior This particular Bitcoin whale activity stands out because of its scale and methodology. The withdrawal of such a substantial amount from a single exchange in such a short timeframe is unusual, even for the cryptocurrency’s largest players. How Do Whale Movements Impact Bitcoin’s Price Trajectory? Historically, significant whale accumulation during market corrections has often preceded substantial price rallies. When large holders remove Bitcoin from exchanges, they effectively reduce the available supply for trading. This scarcity effect, combined with continued demand, creates upward price pressure. However, interpreting whale movements requires caution. While this particular Bitcoin whale activity appears bullish, whales can also trigger market downturns through large sell-offs. The key distinction lies in whether they’re moving assets to cold storage (typically bullish) or between exchanges (potentially bearish). In this case, the withdrawal from FalconX suggests accumulation for holding rather than immediate trading. Market analysts are particularly interested in the FalconX connection. As an institutional-focused platform, FalconX handles substantial volumes for professional investors. A Bitcoin whale moving assets from this specific exchange reinforces the institutional narrative surrounding this transaction. What Can Retail Investors Learn From This Whale Activity? While retail investors cannot match whale-scale transactions, they can learn from their patterns. The disciplined, timed accumulation during price weakness demonstrates a strategy worth noting. Rather than panic selling during dips, this Bitcoin whale is systematically acquiring more assets. Consider these actionable insights from this whale movement: Monitor on-chain data : Tools tracking large transactions provide early signals of market shifts Understand exchange flows : Net withdrawals from major exchanges often precede bullish periods Recognize patterns : Coordinated, identical transactions typically indicate sophisticated players Context matters : Whale activity during price declines carries different implications than during rallies The psychological impact of such visible Bitcoin whale activity cannot be overstated. When large players demonstrate confidence through substantial investments, it often creates a halo effect that boosts overall market sentiment. Conclusion: Decoding the Whale’s Message This $221 million Bitcoin withdrawal represents more than just a large transaction—it’s a potential signal about institutional confidence in Bitcoin’s long-term value proposition. The precise, coordinated nature of the moves suggests sophisticated players are accumulating positions during what they perceive as favorable market conditions. While no single indicator guarantees future price movements, the combination of scale, timing, and pattern makes this whale activity particularly noteworthy. As the cryptocurrency market continues maturing, understanding these large-player movements becomes increasingly crucial for all market participants. The silent message from this Bitcoin whale seems clear: some of the market’s largest players see current levels as accumulation opportunities. Frequently Asked Questions What is a Bitcoin whale? A Bitcoin whale is an individual or entity that holds a sufficiently large amount of Bitcoin to potentially influence market prices through their trading activities. There’s no official threshold, but wallets containing thousands of BTC typically qualify. Why do whales withdraw Bitcoin from exchanges? Whales typically withdraw Bitcoin from exchanges for long-term storage in more secure wallets (cold storage). This reduces their exposure to exchange-related risks and signals an intention to hold rather than trade immediately. How can I track whale movements? Several blockchain analytics platforms like Glassnode, CryptoQuant, and Whale Alert track large transactions. These tools provide real-time alerts about significant movements between wallets and exchanges. Do whale movements always predict price changes? Not always. While large accumulations often precede price increases, correlation doesn’t guarantee causation. Whale movements should be considered alongside other market indicators for more accurate predictions. What’s the difference between whale and institutional activity? While overlapping, “whale” typically refers to any large holder regardless of identity, while “institutional” specifically indicates organizations like hedge funds, corporations, or investment firms. The FalconX withdrawals suggest institutional involvement due to the platform’s focus. How does this affect average Bitcoin investors? Whale activities can influence market sentiment and liquidity, potentially affecting volatility and price trends. However, retail investors should focus on their investment strategies rather than reacting to every whale movement. Found this analysis of Bitcoin whale activity insightful?

According to BitMEX co-founder Arthur Hayes, you might have already missed it. In a recent interview, Hayes delivered a sobering wake-up call to the crypto community, arguing that the season is not coming—it’s already here, and many traders simply failed to recognize it because they were looking for the wrong signs. What Did Arthur Hayes Actually Say About the Altcoin Season? Arthur Hayes, a respected and often provocative voice in crypto, made a clear and direct argument. He stated that traders claiming the altcoin season hasn’t begun are often the ones who did not hold the right assets as their prices surged. His core message challenges a common misconception: the expectation that a market cycle will repeat identically. Hayes insists the market has evolved, entering a new phase where rallies are more selective and nuanced. Why Are So Many Traders Convinced the Altcoin Season Hasn’t Started? This feeling of missing out often stems from outdated benchmarks. Many investors anchor their expectations to previous bull markets, waiting for a broad, simultaneous explosion across all alternative cryptocurrencies. However, the current landscape is different. Capital flows are smarter and more sector-specific. Therefore, if you were only watching Bitcoin or a handful of large-cap tokens, you might have overlooked significant rallies in other areas. Hayes’s point is profound: denial of the season’s existence is frequently just an admission of non-participation. How Has the New Altcoin Season Changed? The dynamics of this altcoin season are distinct. It’s not a uniform tide lifting all boats. Instead, we are seeing rotational surges. Understanding this shift is crucial for future success. Sector-Specific Rallies: Projects in sectors like DeFi, AI, or Real-World Assets (RWA) may pump independently while others remain flat. Reduced Correlation: Altcoins are not moving in perfect lockstep with Bitcoin as they once did, requiring more diligent research. Quality Over Hype: Fundamentals and tokenomics are playing a larger role, separating serious projects from mere memes. What Can You Do If You Missed the First Wave? Feeling like you missed the boat is a common emotion in fast-moving markets, but it’s not a terminal condition. The key is to adapt your strategy for this new environment. First, broaden your perspective beyond the usual suspects. Second, focus on identifying narratives and sectors that are gaining traction but haven’t yet peaked. Finally, practice disciplined entry points; FOMO buying at all-time highs is a recipe for losses. Remember, Hayes isn’t saying the opportunity is over; he’s highlighting that its form has changed. Actionable Insights for Navigating the Current Altcoin Season To position yourself better, consider these steps. Conduct thorough research into emerging crypto sectors. Diversify your watchlist beyond the top 10 by market cap. Most importantly, set clear risk management rules before entering any trade. The market rewards those who are prepared, not just those who are present. In conclusion, Arthur Hayes has issued a vital reality check. The altcoin season is not a spectator event waiting for a starting gun; it is an ongoing process of capital rotation and sectoral growth. Those who adapt to its new rhythm, who research diligently and manage risk wisely, can still find significant opportunities. The season may have started quietly, but for the attentive investor, it is far from over. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q: What exactly is an ‘altcoin season’? A: An ‘altcoin season’ is a period in the cryptocurrency market where alternative cryptocurrencies (altcoins) significantly outperform Bitcoin in terms of price gains. Q: Why does Arthur Hayes say people missed it? A: Hayes argues that because the rallies have been sector-specific and not a broad-based surge across all altcoins, many traders waiting for the latter signal believe it hasn’t started, even though certain assets have already seen massive gains. Q: Is it too late to invest in altcoins now? A> According to the perspective discussed, it is not too late. The season is characterized by rotational rallies, meaning new sectors and projects may see growth as capital moves around the market. Q: How can I identify which altcoins might surge next? A> Focus on researching strong fundamentals, active development, and growing communities within emerging sectors like DeFi, AI, gaming, or layer-2 solutions. Following capital flow data can also provide clues. Q: What is the biggest mistake to avoid during an altcoin season? A> The biggest mistake is FOMO (Fear Of Missing Out) buying into projects that have already seen parabolic rises without understanding their value, and neglecting proper risk management like setting stop-losses.

While short-term price action remains choppy, on-chain indicators suggest that the deeper story may lie beneath the surface. A recent CryptoQuant chart highlights Bitcoin’s NVT Golden Cross, smoothed with a 100-day moving average, offering a clearer lens through which to evaluate the relationship between market valuation and on-chain activity. The Network Value to Transactions (NVT) ratio is often described as Bitcoin’s equivalent of a Price-to-Earnings multiple. Instead of corporate earnings, transaction volume serves as the proxy for economic output. In simple terms, the metric seeks to answer a fundamental question: Is Bitcoin’s market capitalization justified by the amount of real economic activity taking place on the network? When valuation expands faster than transaction volume, the market may be overheating. Conversely, when price lags behind network usage, it can signal undervaluation or excessive risk aversion. The NVT Golden Cross refines this framework by comparing short- and long-term trends in the ratio, helping identify periods when price diverges meaningfully from fundamentals. NVT Golden Cross Signals a Structural Valuation Reset CryptoQuant analyst Moreno emphasizes that the most valuable signals from the NVT Golden Cross tend to appear during deep negative deviations, when market psychology and fundamentals diverge sharply. In the current cycle, the indicator fell to a historically depressed level near -0.58, a zone that goes beyond simple bearish sentiment. According to the analysis, this level reflects a structural undervaluation of the Bitcoin network, where price compression outpaced any meaningful decline in on-chain economic activity. Such conditions are typically observed during phases of forced deleveraging and elevated risk aversion. In these environments, liquidity exits speculative positions aggressively, pushing prices lower even as the underlying network continues to process transactions at relatively stable levels. This imbalance creates valuation gaps that have, in past cycles, marked important inflection points rather than definitive market tops. The key development now is the recovery of the NVT Golden Cross from -0.58 toward approximately -0.32. This move suggests that price is beginning to realign with transaction-driven fundamentals following a sharp valuation reset. However, the indicator remains in negative territory, implying that Bitcoin is still priced conservatively relative to its on-chain utility. Moreno notes that this setup is consistent with a transition phase, where the market moves from deep undervaluation toward equilibrium. Historically, such periods have aligned with accumulation and more disciplined capital allocation, laying the groundwork for healthier, structurally supported price discovery. Bitcoin Consolidates Above Long-Term Support as Trend Weakens The weekly chart shows Bitcoin trading near the $88,000 level after a sharp corrective phase from the cycle highs above $120,000. Price is currently consolidating just above the rising 200-day moving average (green), which sits around the mid-$80,000s and represents a critical long-term trend support. This zone has historically acted as a pivot between sustained bull markets and deeper corrective phases, making the current structure especially important. Momentum, however, has clearly weakened. Bitcoin has lost the 50-day moving average (blue) and failed to reclaim it on recent attempts, signaling that short- to medium-term control remains with sellers. The slope of the 50-day MA has started to flatten, reinforcing the idea of a transition from expansion to consolidation. At the same time, the 100-day moving average is curling lower, adding overhead resistance in the $95,000–$100,000 range. Selling pressure increased during the breakdown from the $100,000 area, while the recent bounce toward $88,000 has occurred on comparatively lighter volume. This suggests that buyers are defending support but lack conviction for a sustained reversal. As long as Bitcoin holds above the 200-day MA, the broader uptrend remains technically intact. However, failure to defend the $85,000–$88,000 zone would open the door to a deeper retracement, while bullish confirmation requires a decisive reclaim of the 50-day moving average with expanding volume.

This potential move not only poses significant financial risks for the firm but could also have broader implications for the cryptocurrency sector, with analysts estimating that it could result in losses up to $9 billion in demand for its shares. Industry-Wide Consequences The MSCI proposed in October that companies holding digital assets comprising 50% or more of their total assets should be removed from its global benchmarks, arguing that such companies resemble investment funds, which are excluded from its indexes. However, many firms, including Strategy, assert that they are operational companies creating innovative products and argue that MSCI’s proposal is biased against the cryptocurrency industry. Related Reading: Solana (SOL) Support Shattered, Potential $100 Test Looms, Says Analyst MSCI is currently conducting a public consultation, and analysts warn that if it decides to exclude Digital Asset Treasury (DAT) companies, it could prompt other index providers to follow suit. “The conversation already extends beyond just MSCI… to the eligibility of DATs in equity indexes in general,” said Kaasha Saini, head of index strategy at Jefferies, who anticipates that most equity indexes will align with MSCI’s decisions. Asset managers are believed to hold as much as 30% of a large-cap company’s free float, leading to potentially significant outflows if these companies are dropped from major indexes. This situation is particularly precarious for the DAT sector, which often finances its token purchases by selling stock. The company’s CEO, Phong Le, and co-founder Michael Saylor addressed the potential MSCI exclusion in a public letter. They estimated that such a move could lead to $2.8 billion worth of the company’s stock being liquidated and may “chill” the entire industry. In their letter, they explained that excluding DATs could shut them out from the roughly $15 trillion passive investment market, drastically undermining their competitive standing. Major Outflows Predicted For Strategy Analysts at TD Cowen estimated in November that around $2.5 billion of Strategy’s market value is linked to MSCI, with an additional $5.5 billion reliant on other indexes. JPMorgan’s analysis suggested that if MSCI were to exclude Strategy, the company could see $2.8 billion in outflows, a figure that could rise to $8.8 billion if it faced exclusion from other indexes, such as the Nasdaq 100, the CRSP US Total Market Index, and various Russell indexes owned by LSEG. In addition to Strategy, MSCI’s preliminary list identifies 38 companies at risk of exclusion, with a combined issuer market cap of $46.7 billion as of September 30, including French firm Capital B, which is also investing in Bitcoin.

Matt Cole, CEO of US-based Bitcoin buyer Strive—which is not at risk of exclusion—notes that the proposals have largely been factored into market valuations. He added, “On a longer-term basis, I think it raises the cost of capital for all Bitcoin treasury companies.” At the time of writing, the firm’s stock, which trades on the Nasdaq under the ticker symbol MSTR, was trading at $165, marking gains of almost 4% ahead of the close of trading this week.

You’re not alone. The Bitcoin price is facing significant headwinds as a wave of concerning economic data from the United States sends shockwaves through global markets. Investors, spooked by the numbers, are executing a classic maneuver: the flight to safety. This shift in sentiment is creating a challenging environment for cryptocurrencies, pulling capital away from volatile assets like Bitcoin and into perceived stable harbors. Why is the Bitcoin Price Under Pressure? The recent slump in the Bitcoin price isn’t happening in a vacuum. It’s a direct reaction to fundamental economic signals. According to a Cointelegraph analysis, two key factors are driving the sell-off. First, recent U.S. employment figures came in weaker than expected, hinting at a slowing economy. Second, broader economic growth metrics are also flashing warning signs. When traditional markets get nervous, the ripple effects are felt acutely in the crypto space. This creates a perfect storm for Bitcoin. The asset, often touted as ‘digital gold,’ is currently being treated as a risk-on investment by the majority of the market. Therefore, when fear grips investors, they retreat to assets with a long history as stores of value during turmoil. The Safe Haven Shift: Where is the Money Going? So, if money is flowing out of Bitcoin, where is it going? The answer lies in traditional finance. Investors are pivoting hard towards assets known for their stability during economic uncertainty. U.S. Treasury Bonds: Demand for government debt has surged. Bonds are seen as one of the safest bets, especially when economic growth falters. Gold: The classic safe-haven asset is seeing renewed interest as a tangible store of value outside the financial system. The U.S. Dollar: The dollar often strengthens during global uncertainty as investors seek liquidity and stability. This mass migration is compounded by shifting expectations from the Federal Reserve. With sticky inflation and a still-strong labor market, the likelihood of an imminent interest rate cut has diminished. Higher rates for longer make yield-bearing, safe assets like bonds more attractive compared to non-yielding cryptocurrencies, further pressuring the Bitcoin price . Is This Just a U.S. Problem? While the U.S. data is the primary catalyst, global economic worries are adding fuel to the fire. For instance, Japan recently slipped into an unexpected recession. This global economic fragility reinforces the risk-off mood. Investors are not just reacting to one country’s data; they are reassessing global growth prospects. In such an environment, high-volatility assets like Bitcoin are often the first to be sold, regardless of their long-term potential. The key takeaway is that cryptocurrency markets remain deeply interconnected with traditional finance. Macroeconomic indicators, central bank policies, and global risk sentiment are powerful forces that can override crypto-specific narratives in the short term. What Can Investors Do During This Bitcoin Price Weakness? Market downturns, while stressful, are a normal part of the investment cycle. Here are some actionable insights: Assess Your Risk Tolerance: Ensure your portfolio allocation to crypto aligns with your long-term goals and ability to handle volatility. Consider Dollar-Cost Averaging (DCA): For long-term believers, a lower Bitcoin price can be an opportunity to accumulate assets gradually at a discount. Diversify: Don’t put all your capital into one asset class. A diversified portfolio can better weather different economic storms. Stay Informed: Follow credible sources to understand the macro trends driving market sentiment beyond daily price movements. Conclusion: Navigating the Storm The current Bitcoin price action is a stark reminder that cryptocurrencies are not yet decoupled from traditional market forces. The flight to safety, triggered by poor U.S. economic data and global recession fears, is a powerful short-term headwind. However, for patient investors, these periods of fear and selling often create the foundations for future growth. The fundamental narrative around Bitcoin and digital assets continues to evolve, but its journey will inevitably be marked by volatility as it interacts with the wider economic world. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q: How long will this Bitcoin price downturn last? A: It’s impossible to predict exact timelines. The duration will depend on upcoming economic data, Federal Reserve policy signals, and broader global market sentiment. Historically, crypto markets recover, but the timing is always uncertain. Q: Should I sell my Bitcoin now? A: This is a personal decision based on your investment strategy. Selling during a dip locks in losses. Many long-term investors view these periods as buying opportunities, but you should never invest money you cannot afford to lose. Q: What economic data should I watch? A: Key indicators include the U.S. Consumer Price Index (CPI) for inflation, monthly Non-Farm Payrolls for employment, and Gross Domestic Product (GDP) for growth. Federal Reserve meeting minutes and statements are also critical. Q: Are all cryptocurrencies affected the same way? A> Generally, yes. Bitcoin often sets the trend for the broader crypto market. During strong risk-off events, most altcoins tend to fall even more sharply due to their higher volatility and perceived risk. Q: Is this a good time to buy Bitcoin? A> For investors with a long-term horizon and a strategy like Dollar-Cost Averaging, lower prices can be attractive. However, trying to ‘time the bottom’ is extremely difficult and risky. Q: Does this mean Bitcoin failed as a safe haven? A> In the short term, the market is not treating it as one. Bitcoin’s narrative as a hedge against inflation and systemic risk is a long-term thesis that is still being tested over multiple economic cycles.

He says a memecoin launch tied to the president, coming just days before his return to the White House, helped turn a once-bipartisan push for basic crypto rules into a political hot potato. Political Optics Shift Quickly According to Hoskinson, crypto had been building bipartisan momentum and a bill known as the Clarity Act looked likely to win broad support — with around 70 senators expected to vote in favor at one point. That momentum faded when the market saw the president enter the arena with his own token, Hoskinson said, making it politically risky for many Democrats to back crypto measures. CHARLES HOSKINSON: TRUMP’S MEMECOIN DERAILED CRYPTO REGULATION Charles Hoskinson says crypto was on track for a bipartisan regulatory win, until TrumpCoin changed the optics. According to Hoskinson, the CLARITY Act was expected to pass with broad support in late 2024. Around 70… pic.twitter.com/zpA7TRilqV — CryptosRus (@CryptosR_Us) December 19, 2025 Strong Language Hoskinson called the subject a “third rail,” meaning politicians and many industry figures avoid it because it brings big political risk. He told reporters that, in his view, the launch of the memecoin changed how the public and lawmakers linked crypto to one political figure, a shift that made clean rule-making harder. Silence Inside The Industry Reports have disclosed that many crypto executives kept their distance from public criticism. Hoskinson said industry leaders feared losing access to policy talks or being shut out of private meetings if they spoke out. That worry, he argued, led to a quiet industry response even as the rules debate grew more urgent. Timing And Rule Order Raise Concerns Hoskinson also criticized earlier projects connected to the president, including World Liberty Financial , and questioned the timing of launching a commercial crypto product while influence over policy was possible. “You shouldn’t launch a product first and then make the rules,” he said, arguing that regulations should come before big political actors push private ventures into the market. What This Means For Lawmakers Based on reports, the fallout has made committee work and markups more fraught. Lawmakers who once saw an opportunity to write clear rules now face greater political cost from appearing to side with one high-profile figure. That dynamic could push the timetable for formal votes and hearings further out, officials and analysts say. Hoskinson framed his critique as a warning about mixing personal ventures and political power at a moment when the industry needs steady rules. Whether his view will change the debate is uncertain. What is clear is that linking crypto to a single political brand has complicated efforts to secure broad legal ground rules, and that may slow a process many in the market had hoped would be straightforward.

Some analysts have suggested that the altcoin is poised to bounce, but others warned that a potential rally could be short-lived. Related Reading: Bitcoin Mirrors Q1 2025 Playbook, Is It Headed To $70,000 Before Year’s End? Solana To Tag Higher Levels Soon On Friday, Solana recovered from the latest drop and surged 7.7% toward the $125 area. The cryptocurrency fell nearly 9% on Thursday afternoon amid a broader market correction, sending its price to an eight-month low of $116. Amid the pullback, SOL’s price breached below a crucial high timeframe level, the around $120 mark, for the first time since April before recovering. Analyst Crypto Batman noted the altcoin “is not only at its major support level, the same one that has held price for the past 2 years.” In addition, the cryptocurrency is also forming a bullish divergence on the 3-day timeframe, “exactly like what we saw before the major bottom” at the start of Q2, the market observer added. To him, this suggests that Solana could bottom soon and see the start of a recovery rally to the macro range highs. However, another market observer affirmed that even if a retest of the higher levels is likely, “context matters here.” Analyst Crypto Scient highlighted that SOL’s price is currently at the range lows of its multi-year range, recording the first retest of this area after being rejected from the range highs. “One could argue SOL has been distributive for nearly two years now. That’s fair,” he explained, “[but] range lows rarely break on the first attempt.” Moreover, Scient pointed out that there’s significant liquidity left between the $175–$190 levels that “should get tagged at some point, even within a broader bearish environment.” As a result, the analyst considers that a “move higher to clean liquidity before any deeper downside would make far more sense.” December Close To Define SOL’s Fate? Analyst Rekt Capital affirmed that the $123 horizontal support remains the “defining level” that Solana must hold to prevent a major breakdown to multi-year lows. He detailed rebounds from this support have historically produced “outsized upside expansions,” with 140% and 100% moves. However, each rebound from this level has been progressively weaker over time, with the most recent bounce only managing to rally 15%. This signals a “sharp deceleration in upside responsiveness at this level,” which is important to consider as the compression in rebound magnitude could affect SOL’s monthly close. According to the analysis, a monthly close above the macro support would keep Solana positioned for a weaker rally, but a close below $123 would substantially change the structure. The second case would suggest that distribution has already started and confirm “how much this support has weakened since the last meaningful rebound that produced a near 2x move earlier this year.” Related Reading: Did Crypto Investors Stop Believing In The Four-Year Cycle? Analyst Weighs In Moreover, it would begin to mirror SOL’s performance in early 2022, when a similar price action preceded “macro relief moves during the opening phase of the Bear Market, including the decisive breakdown that occurred at the turn of that year.” Ultimately, the analyst warned that it remains to be seen whether the altcoin can close December above this crucial level and rebound, or if a breakdown “accelerates distribution sooner rather than later.” As of this writing, Solana is trading at $126, a 3.4% decline in the weekly timeframe.

Following Kwon’s conviction, the company’s bankruptcy administrator has initiated a lawsuit against Jump Trading. Terraform Labs Files $4 Billion Lawsuit On social media platform X (formerly Twitter), the Office of the Terraform Labs Plan Administrator announced that it is pursuing a $4 billion lawsuit against Jump Trading. The lawsuit accuses the firm of engaging in “illicit market manipulation, self-dealing, and misuse of assets,” all of which allegedly enriched the company at the expense of unsuspecting investors. The administrator emphasized that this legal action aims to recover lost value for creditors and hold Jump accountable for exploiting the Terraform ecosystem. The demise of Terraform Labs in 2022 began when its stablecoin, TerraUSD , lost its dollar peg, triggering a catastrophic sequence of events that devalued its sister token, Luna. This collapse wiped out approximately $40 billion in value, affecting investors globally and initiating a ripple effect throughout the cryptocurrency industry. Notably, Terraform Labs’ turmoil also contributed to the eventual failure of Sam Bankman-Fried’s FTX exchange. In response, a Jump Trading spokesperson stated that the lawsuit is a “desperate attempt by Terraform Labs” to deflect blame and financial liability for Kwon’s actions. The spokesperson asserted their intention to vigorously contest what they described as baseless claims. Kwon’s Potential Second Trial In South Korea Last week, it was reported that Do Kwon had pleaded guilty to charges involving conspiracy to defraud and wire fraud. Kwon admitted to misleading investors about the stability of TerraUSD. During his sentencing, US District Judge Paul A. Engelmayer pointed out that Kwon had repeatedly deceived investors who had placed their trust in him, describing the fraud as one of “epic, generational scale.” Kwon expressed remorse in court, mentioning that he had spent considerable time reflecting on his actions and contemplating how to make amends. Prosecutors alleged that when TerraUSD fell below its $1 target in May 2021, Kwon misled investors into believing that a computer algorithm would restore its value. Meanwhile, court documents revealed that he had arranged for a trading firm to secretly purchase millions of dollars’ worth of the coin to artificially inflate its price. Yet, the legal issues for Kwon are far from over. South Korean officials indicated that he could face a second trial and additional sentences should he be extradited after serving part of his US sentence. There are expectations that the Terraform Labs co-founder may apply for the International Prisoner Transfer Program once he completes half of his 15-year term. This potential extradition poses a significant threat, as Kwon faces multiple charges related to violations of the Capital Markets Act in South Korea, where there are over 200,000 reported victims and estimated losses exceeding $204 million. With ten alleged accomplices already on trial in South Korea, authorities believe that prosecuting Kwon domestically would be essential in compensating local victims . A guilty verdict in his home country could lead to a sentence exceeding 30 years, according to a senior prosecutor’s statement. At the time of writing, Luna Classic (LUNC) is trading at $0.00004010, having recorded losses of 17% over the past week. However, the token has increased in value by 28% over the past month, following Kwon’s sentencing hearing which boosted the price of the cryptocurrency.

Unlike other digital currencies, it wasn’t predestined for mining but it was created as a super-efficient pathway for value transfers. It is quick, cheap, and yet very stable making it most commonly used for international settlements, institutional payments, and other financial sector activities. Due to the fact that XRP uses the Ripple Consensus Protocol (RPCA), hashing power is not a way the network security is ensured, unlike in other blockchains . Hence, it is definitely more energy-efficient and environmentally friendly, but one wonders: If XRP is not mined, then how can XRP holders regularly generate returns? Many investors are wondering whether there is a way to actively engage in the market apart from passively waiting for the price changes. From Holding to Participation: A New Approach Brought by Cloud Hashrate How about letting your static XRP holdings work for you through participation made possible by cloud hashrate? FleetMining is a platform that operates from intelligent scheduling and global hashrate resources standpoint. It offers users the ability to: • Engage in mining without the need to buy or service physical mining machines • Participate in mining activities without the need for technical knowledge • Directly take part in the output of the hashrate of the most popular networks, such as BTC, ETC, and DOGE Therefore, the mining ecosystem that is capable of generating cash flow becomes available to you even if your dominant asset is XRP and you have chosen the cloud hashrate model. For the first time in a long while, XRP holders get the chance to materially increase the effectiveness of their assets: they can unlock new channels of participation without having to give up their existing allocation. Reasons Why XRP Holders Should Consider This Model ① Diversification of asset value sources The long-term value of XRP would continually be closely linked to the adoption of its use cases and development of the ecosystem. At the same time, cloud hashrate participation provides a totally different rhythm and cycle of engagement. ② Low entry-level, suitable for non-techies You don’t have to figure out specifics of the mining machine parameters, electricity costs, or maintenance tasks — the platform handles it all. ③ Can be an intrapersonal interaction factor in a portfolio Besides holding-type assets, the overall portfolio flexibility can be enhanced through the introduction of a cycle-based participation model. How FleetMining Works FleetMining has its data centers located in several areas and it is providing users with a “hashrate as a service” option by way of centralized hashrate resources: Choose a contract → System allocates hashrate → Automatic output → Cycle settlement The platform takes care of everything, so users only need to keep track of their contracts and accounts. Get Started in Three Steps: XRP Users Can Participate Easily ① Create an account Visit the FleetMining official website and register using your email address. New users can receive a bonus of $15-$100 , which can be used to experience contracts. ② Choose a hashrate contract There are various mainstream hashrate contracts on the platform for the supported cryptocurrencies such as BTC, ETH and DOGE, e.g.: General-purpose $15 trial contract, 1-day cycle → about $0.6 You can participate once a day (free plan, start at zero cost). $100 contract, 2-day cycle → a total of $106 at maturity $1,200 contract, 10-day cycle → a total of $1,362 at maturity $6,000 contract, 20-day cycle → a total of $7,920 at maturity $30,000 contract, 45-day cycle → a total of $54,300 at maturity ③ Automatic operation and settlement Once the contract is activated, cloud mining will begin automatically. Earnings are settled daily, and the principal is returned at the end of the cycle. Users can withdraw their funds once their account balance reaches $100. Platform Features Multi-region hashrate deployment: North America, Europe, Central Asia, etc. Multi-layer security mechanisms: encrypted transmission + cold storage management ⚡ Zero technical threshold: no hardware or operation experience required Green energy direction: continuous transition toward low-carbon hashrate 24/7 support: round-the-clock customer service Transparent earnings: real-time data available A New Perspective for XRP Holders XRP stands for the efficient financial networks of the future while cloud hashrate is a means of monetizing computing power. They are actually two sides of the same coin rather than opposites: on the one hand, holding a position for long-term value, on the other hand, gaining more interaction in the digital economy via hashrate participation. What will be decisive when the crypto market is fully mature may not be “which coin to buy,” but — How efficiently you participate in the entire ecosystem. FleetMining offers precisely such a new participation route for those who have XRP in their ‍‌wallets.

Binance co-founder Changpeng ‘CZ’ Zhao presented a compelling case that Bitcoin is solidifying its role as a global reserve asset . This transformation is not driven by retail hype, but by a fundamental shift: nations and major financial institutions are now integrating Bitcoin into their core strategies. This institutional embrace creates a new era of stability and legitimacy for the entire digital asset ecosystem. How is Bitcoin Becoming a Global Reserve Asset? CZ argued that participation from sovereign nations and blue-chip corporations creates a powerful, self-reinforcing cycle. First, their involvement brings massive capital inflows. This capital then pressures regulators for clearer rules, which in turn boosts public trust and awareness. The result? Bitcoin’s path to becoming a global reserve asset accelerates as it moves from the fringe to the financial mainstream. This cycle is already in motion, changing how the world views digital value. What Role Do Institutions Play in This Shift? The entry of institutional capital is the primary engine for change. CZ highlighted two key vehicles driving this adoption: Crypto ETFs: These funds provide a familiar, regulated gateway for traditional stock market investors to gain exposure to Bitcoin without directly holding the asset. Digital Asset Treasury (DAT) Companies: CZ described these as having a more flexible structure than ETFs. They act as specialized firms that manage crypto assets, offering another indirect pathway for institutional money to flow into the market. This institutional influx does more than just raise prices. It expands the total market capitalization, which naturally leads to reduced volatility . A larger, more liquid market is a more stable market, making Bitcoin a more viable reserve asset for large portfolios. Is U.S. Policy Finally Catching Up? Perhaps one of the most surprising insights from CZ was the speed of regulatory change in the United States. He noted that U.S. policy is evolving “faster than expected.” A key signal was a recent suggestion from the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) that it may allow American investors to use overseas crypto exchanges. This indicates a significant softening of the previously hardline stance. CZ concluded that the U.S. is now entering a crucial phase: establishing the baseline rules for global digital asset regulation. As the world’s largest financial market, America’s regulatory framework will inevitably influence standards worldwide, providing further clarity for institutions looking to adopt Bitcoin. What Does This Mean for the Future of Finance? The implications are profound. If CZ’s vision holds, we are witnessing the early stages of a monetary paradigm shift. Bitcoin’s properties—decentralization, scarcity, and borderless transfer—are being recognized not just by technologists, but by the very institutions that manage the world’s wealth. The journey of Bitcoin as a global reserve asset is moving from theory to tangible reality, backed by national treasuries and corporate balance sheets. In summary, the narrative around Bitcoin is undergoing a fundamental rewrite. It is no longer a speculative gamble but is increasingly seen as a strategic, long-term store of value. The combined force of institutional adoption, growing regulatory clarity, and national-level interest is building an unstoppable momentum. This convergence is what solidifies Bitcoin’s powerful claim to becoming a cornerstone of the future global financial system. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) What is a global reserve asset? A global reserve asset is a currency or asset held in significant quantities by governments and institutions as part of their foreign exchange reserves. It is used for international transactions and as a store of value, like the US dollar or gold. How does institutional adoption reduce Bitcoin’s volatility? When large institutions like pension funds or corporations buy Bitcoin, they typically hold it for the long term. This “buy and hold” behavior reduces the amount of Bitcoin actively traded on exchanges, decreasing sharp price swings and increasing overall market stability. What is the difference between a Bitcoin ETF and a DAT company? A Bitcoin ETF is a fund traded on a stock exchange that tracks Bitcoin’s price. A DAT (Digital Asset Treasury) company is a firm that specializes in acquiring, managing, and securing digital assets like Bitcoin, often offering more flexible investment structures than a standard ETF. Why is U.S. regulatory change so important? The United States has the world’s largest capital markets. Clear regulations from U.S. agencies like the SEC and CFTC provide a legal framework that gives traditional financial institutions the confidence they need to invest billions of dollars into Bitcoin and other crypto assets. Which countries are adopting Bitcoin as a reserve asset? While El Salvador made headlines as the first country to adopt Bitcoin as legal tender, other nations are exploring adding it to their national reserves. This trend is a key part of the argument for Bitcoin becoming a global reserve asset. Does this mean Bitcoin will replace the US dollar? Not necessarily in the short term. Most analysts see Bitcoin evolving as a complementary reserve asset, similar to gold, rather than a direct replacement for traditional fiat currencies like the dollar in everyday transactions. Did you find this breakdown of Bitcoin’s institutional journey insightful? The shift towards a global reserve asset is a historic financial story.

As the cryptocurrency market continues to evolve, one question dominates the conversation among investors and analysts alike: What does the future hold for Ripple’s XRP? With its unique position in the financial technology space and ongoing legal developments, XRP has captured the attention of the crypto community. This comprehensive analysis explores the potential price trajectory of XRP from 2025 through 2030, examining whether the digital asset can achieve the ambitious $5 target that many enthusiasts are hoping for. Understanding Ripple XRP Price Prediction Fundamentals Before diving into specific price targets, it’s crucial to understand what drives XRP’s value. Unlike many cryptocurrencies that position themselves as alternatives to traditional money, XRP serves primarily as a bridge currency in Ripple’s payment network. This practical utility in cross-border transactions gives XRP a distinct value proposition. The Ripple XRP price prediction for any given year depends on several interconnected factors including regulatory clarity, adoption by financial institutions, market sentiment, and broader cryptocurrency trends. XRP Price 2025: The First Major Test Looking at the near-term horizon, 2025 represents a critical juncture for XRP. By this time, the lingering effects of Ripple’s legal battle with the SEC should be fully resolved, providing much-needed regulatory clarity. Most analysts project that if institutional adoption continues at its current pace, we could see XRP trading in a range between $1.50 and $2.80 by the end of 2025. This projection assumes: Continued expansion of RippleNet partnerships with financial institutions Favorable regulatory outcomes in major markets Overall growth in the cryptocurrency market capitalization Successful implementation of Ripple’s liquidity solutions Can XRP Reach $5? The Path to a Major Milestone The question of whether XRP can reach $5 dominates discussions about the token’s long-term potential. Achieving this price point would represent approximately a 10x increase from current levels and would require several conditions to align perfectly. For XRP to reach $5, we would need to see: Requirement Description Mass Adoption Widespread use of Ripple’s solutions by major banks and payment providers Market Conditions Favorable cryptocurrency market cycle with increased institutional investment Regulatory Clarity Clear, supportive regulations across major global economies Technological Advancements Continued innovation in Ripple’s blockchain solutions Most conservative analysts suggest that if XRP reaches $5, it’s more likely to happen toward the latter part of our prediction window, possibly in 2029 or 2030, rather than in the immediate future. XRP Future Price: 2026-2030 Long-Term Outlook Looking beyond 2025, the XRP future price trajectory becomes increasingly dependent on macro factors and adoption metrics. Here’s a year-by-year breakdown of potential scenarios: 2026: $2.20 – $3.50 range as institutional adoption matures 2027: $2.80 – $4.20 range with potential regulatory breakthroughs 2028: $3.50 – $5.00 range if cross-border payment dominance emerges 2029: $4.00 – $6.50 range in a best-case adoption scenario 2030: $5.00 – $10.00 range if blockchain payments become mainstream These projections represent optimistic but plausible scenarios based on current adoption trends and market dynamics. Ripple Cryptocurrency Forecast: Key Factors to Watch Any accurate Ripple cryptocurrency forecast must account for several critical variables that could significantly impact XRP’s price trajectory: Legal Resolution: The final outcome of Ripple’s ongoing regulatory challenges Bank Adoption: How many financial institutions implement Ripple’s solutions Market Competition: Developments from competing blockchain payment solutions Economic Factors: Global economic conditions and currency volatility Technological Innovation: Advances in Ripple’s blockchain technology Challenges and Risks in XRP Price Prediction While the potential for growth exists, investors must also consider the significant challenges facing XRP. Regulatory uncertainty remains the primary concern, as different jurisdictions continue to develop their approaches to cryptocurrency regulation. Competition from both traditional financial systems and other blockchain projects creates additional pressure. Market volatility, which affects all cryptocurrencies, can dramatically impact short-term price movements regardless of fundamental developments. Actionable Insights for XRP Investors For those considering XRP as part of their investment portfolio, several strategies can help navigate the uncertainty: Diversify your cryptocurrency holdings beyond XRP Monitor regulatory developments closely Consider dollar-cost averaging rather than timing the market Stay informed about Ripple’s partnership announcements Set realistic profit targets and risk management strategies Frequently Asked Questions What is Ripple and how is it different from XRP? Ripple is a technology company that develops the RippleNet payment network, while XRP is the native cryptocurrency used within this ecosystem. You can learn more about the company at the official Ripple website . Who is Brad Garlinghouse and what is his role? Brad Garlinghouse serves as the CEO of Ripple Labs. His leadership has been instrumental in navigating the company through regulatory challenges and expanding its global partnerships. Follow his updates on his Twitter profile . What was the SEC lawsuit about? The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission filed a lawsuit against Ripple Labs, alleging that XRP was an unregistered security. This legal battle has significantly impacted XRP’s price and adoption prospects. How does XRP compare to SWIFT? Ripple’s technology aims to provide faster, cheaper cross-border payments compared to the traditional SWIFT system. While SWIFT remains dominant, Ripple has made significant inroads with financial institutions seeking more efficient solutions. What banks are currently using Ripple’s technology? Several financial institutions have partnered with Ripple, including Santander, Bank of America, and SBI Remit. The complete list of partners continues to grow as more institutions explore blockchain-based payment solutions. Conclusion: The Road Ahead for XRP The journey toward $5 for XRP is neither guaranteed nor straightforward. It will require a combination of favorable regulatory outcomes, continued technological innovation, and broader market adoption. While the potential exists for significant growth, particularly in the latter half of this decade, investors should approach XRP with both optimism and caution. The cryptocurrency’s unique position in the financial technology landscape gives it distinct advantages, but also exposes it to specific regulatory and competitive pressures. As with any investment, thorough research and risk management remain essential.

This comprehensive analysis examines expert forecasts, market trends, and fundamental factors that could shape Bitcoin’s valuation in the coming years. Whether you’re a seasoned trader or new to cryptocurrency, understanding these Bitcoin price prediction models is essential for making informed investment decisions. What Drives Bitcoin Price Predictions for 2025-2030? Several key factors influence long-term Bitcoin price prediction models. Institutional adoption has accelerated since 2020, with companies like MicroStrategy and Tesla adding BTC to their balance sheets. Regulatory developments across major economies will significantly impact market accessibility and stability. The Bitcoin halving cycle, occurring approximately every four years, historically triggers supply shocks that affect valuation. Technological advancements in the Bitcoin network, including layer-2 solutions like the Lightning Network, improve scalability and utility. Global macroeconomic conditions, particularly inflation rates and currency devaluation concerns, continue to drive demand for Bitcoin as a potential hedge against traditional financial systems. Bitcoin Price Prediction 2025: Post-Halving Momentum The 2024 Bitcoin halving event will set the stage for 2025’s market dynamics. Historical patterns suggest that the most significant price appreciation typically occurs 12-18 months after halving events. Most analysts project a conservative range between $120,000 and $180,000 for Bitcoin in 2025, assuming continued institutional adoption and favorable regulatory environments. However, more optimistic models suggest potential peaks above $200,000 if mainstream financial integration accelerates. Key factors to watch include ETF approvals in additional jurisdictions, central bank digital currency developments, and global economic recovery patterns that could influence risk asset allocation. Analyst/Institution 2025 Prediction Range Key Assumptions Standard Chartered $120,000 – $150,000 Moderate institutional adoption Bloomberg Intelligence $100,000 – $180,000 Continued ETF inflows ARK Invest $150,000 – $250,000 Accelerating network adoption BTC Price Forecast 2026-2027: Consolidation or Breakout? The period between 2026 and 2027 represents a critical phase in Bitcoin’s market cycle. Following potential 2025 peaks, markets typically enter consolidation periods where prices stabilize before the next major move. Our BTC price forecast suggests a trading range between $150,000 and $250,000 during this period, with volatility decreasing as market maturity increases. Several developments could influence this timeframe: Potential regulatory clarity in major markets like the United States and European Union Integration of Bitcoin into traditional payment and settlement systems Development of more sophisticated financial products around Bitcoin Technological improvements addressing scalability and environmental concerns The cryptocurrency market analysis for this period must consider both technical factors and broader economic conditions that could affect digital asset valuations. Bitcoin Halving Impact on 2028-2030 Projections The next Bitcoin halving, expected around 2028, will create another supply shock that historically precedes significant bull markets. This Bitcoin halving impact could propel prices to new all-time highs between 2029 and 2030. Long-term Bitcoin investment strategies should account for this cyclical pattern. Projections for this period vary widely but generally fall into three categories: Conservative estimates: $250,000 – $400,000 based on gradual adoption Moderate projections: $400,000 – $750,000 assuming accelerated institutional participation Optimistic scenarios: $750,000 – $1,000,000+ in hyper-adoption cases These projections depend heavily on Bitcoin maintaining its dominance in the cryptocurrency sector and successfully addressing scalability challenges through ongoing protocol improvements. Risks and Challenges in Long-Term Bitcoin Investment While optimistic Bitcoin price prediction models capture attention, responsible investors must consider potential downside scenarios and risks. Regulatory crackdowns in major economies could significantly impact accessibility and valuation. Technological competition from other blockchain projects or quantum computing advancements might challenge Bitcoin’s security model. Environmental concerns regarding proof-of-work consensus could lead to restrictions in certain jurisdictions. Market saturation or the emergence of superior store-of-value assets might reduce Bitcoin’s dominance. Macroeconomic factors including interest rate policies, recession risks, and geopolitical tensions create additional uncertainty for all risk assets, including cryptocurrencies. Actionable Insights for Bitcoin Investors Based on comprehensive cryptocurrency market analysis, several strategies emerge for navigating Bitcoin’s potential trajectory: Dollar-cost averaging: Systematic investment reduces timing risk in volatile markets Portfolio allocation: Most advisors recommend 1-5% allocation for balanced risk exposure Security prioritization: Self-custody solutions protect against exchange vulnerabilities Continuous education: Staying informed about technological and regulatory developments Risk management: Establishing clear entry and exit strategies based on personal financial goals Remember that all BTC price forecast models contain significant uncertainty, and past performance never guarantees future results in any investment market. Conclusion: The Transformative Potential of Bitcoin Bitcoin’s journey from 2025 to 2030 represents one of the most fascinating financial narratives of our time. While precise Bitcoin price prediction remains challenging, the underlying trends suggest continued growth potential as digital assets mature. The combination of fixed supply, increasing adoption, and technological innovation creates a compelling case for Bitcoin’s long-term value proposition.

This concerning trend highlights shifting investor sentiment in the cryptocurrency ETF space, particularly affecting industry giant BlackRock. Let’s examine what’s driving these withdrawals and what they signal for the market. Why Are US Bitcoin ETFs Experiencing These Outflows? According to data from TraderT, the outflows represent a clear pattern of investor caution. The primary driver was BlackRock’s IBIT fund, which saw a substantial $173.74 million exit on a single day. This movement suggests that even established financial giants aren’t immune to market pressures when it comes to cryptocurrency investments. Several factors could explain this trend: Year-end portfolio rebalancing by institutional investors Profit-taking after recent Bitcoin price movements Increased market volatility affecting risk appetite Broader economic concerns influencing investment decisions Is There Any Positive News Among US Bitcoin ETFs? Interestingly, not all news was negative. Fidelity’s FBTC emerged as the sole bright spot, attracting $15.33 million in inflows during the same period. This divergence between fund performances reveals important insights about investor preferences and fund management strategies. The fact that all other US Bitcoin ETFs reported zero net flows indicates a cautious holding pattern among many investors. They’re neither committing new capital nor withdrawing existing investments from most funds, suggesting a wait-and-see approach to market developments. What Does This Mean for Bitcoin ETF Investors? For current and prospective investors in US Bitcoin ETFs, these developments offer crucial lessons. First, they demonstrate that even within the same asset class, different funds can experience dramatically different flows based on their reputation, management, and investor perception. Second, the consecutive days of outflows serve as a reminder that cryptocurrency investments remain subject to significant volatility. However, it’s important to maintain perspective – these movements represent normal market dynamics rather than fundamental problems with US Bitcoin ETFs as an investment vehicle. How Should You Respond to These Market Movements? Rather than reacting impulsively to short-term flows, consider these strategic approaches: Diversify across multiple US Bitcoin ETFs to mitigate single-fund risk Maintain a long-term perspective rather than chasing daily fluctuations Monitor fund fundamentals rather than just flow data Consider dollar-cost averaging to smooth out market volatility The performance of US Bitcoin ETFs, particularly the contrast between BlackRock’s outflows and Fidelity’s inflows, provides valuable market intelligence. It shows that investor confidence varies significantly between providers, possibly reflecting differences in fund management, fee structures, or perceived stability. What’s the Future Outlook for US Bitcoin ETFs? While two days of outflows might seem alarming, they represent a small fraction of the total assets under management in US Bitcoin ETFs. The market for these investment vehicles continues to evolve, with daily flows providing important but incomplete pictures of long-term trends. As regulatory frameworks mature and institutional adoption grows, US Bitcoin ETFs are likely to experience both inflows and outflows as normal market behavior. The key for investors is to focus on the underlying value proposition of Bitcoin exposure through regulated, transparent vehicles. In conclusion, the recent outflows from US Bitcoin ETFs, particularly from BlackRock’s IBIT fund, highlight the dynamic nature of cryptocurrency investments. While concerning in isolation, these movements should be viewed within the broader context of market cycles and investor behavior patterns. The divergence between fund performances underscores the importance of careful fund selection and diversified exposure within the US Bitcoin ETF space. Frequently Asked Questions What caused the outflows from BlackRock’s IBIT? The $173.74 million outflow likely resulted from a combination of year-end portfolio adjustments, profit-taking by institutional investors, and reactions to broader market conditions affecting cryptocurrency sentiment. Are US Bitcoin ETFs still a good investment? Yes, US Bitcoin ETFs remain a regulated, accessible way to gain Bitcoin exposure. Short-term flows don’t necessarily reflect long-term value, and these vehicles continue to provide important infrastructure for institutional cryptocurrency investment. Why did Fidelity’s FBTC see inflows while others had outflows? Different investor bases, fund characteristics, and timing of investments can cause divergence between fund flows. Some investors may prefer Fidelity’s approach or fee structure, leading to continued confidence during market uncertainty. How significant are these outflows compared to total assets? While $158.41 million sounds substantial, it represents a relatively small percentage of the total assets under management across all US Bitcoin ETFs, indicating these are normal market movements rather than systemic issues. Should I sell my US Bitcoin ETF holdings because of these outflows? Not necessarily. Investment decisions should be based on your financial goals, risk tolerance, and time horizon rather than reacting to short-term flow data. Consult with a financial advisor for personalized guidance. Will these outflows continue? Market flows are unpredictable and can change rapidly based on numerous factors. While patterns can emerge, there’s no guarantee that outflows will continue, and the market could easily reverse course based on new developments. Found this analysis helpful?

Data reveals a concerning trend: U.S. spot ETH ETFs have now recorded their seventh consecutive trading day of net outflows, with a significant $75.44 million exiting on December 19th alone. This persistent drain raises critical questions about the short-term appetite for these regulated crypto investment vehicles. What’s Behind the Spot ETH ETF Outflow Streak? The latest data, compiled by TraderT, points to a specific source for the December 19th exodus. The entire $75.44 million net outflow originated from a single fund: BlackRock’s iShares Ethereum Trust (ETHA). Interestingly, all other spot ETH ETFs reported zero net flows for the day, making BlackRock’s product the sole contributor to the negative tally. This pattern suggests the outflows are not a broad-based rejection but may be tied to specific fund dynamics or investor strategies. However, seven days is a trend, not an anomaly. This extended period of net outflows for spot ETH ETFs indicates a shift in sentiment since their launch. Several factors could be at play, including profit-taking after initial rallies, broader crypto market uncertainty, or investors reallocating capital ahead of the year-end. Is the BlackRock ETHA Outflow a Cause for Alarm? Seeing the world’s largest asset manager’s fund lead the outflows is notable. It’s crucial to analyze this without panic. Large institutional products like ETHA often see significant creation and redemption activity as part of normal market mechanics and arbitrage. The concentration of outflows in one fund could reflect tactical moves by a limited number of large authorized participants rather than a mass retail exodus. Market Context: The outflows coincide with a period of consolidation for Ethereum’s price. Liquidity Flows: ETF flows are just one piece of the puzzle for overall Ethereum demand. Long-Term View: Early volatility in flows is common for new financial products. Therefore, while the headline number is stark, it requires context. The zero flows from other spot ETH ETFs show the situation is not universally dire across all providers. What Do Persistent Spot ETH ETF Outflows Signal for Investors? For everyday investors, this trend is a valuable data point, not a definitive signal. Consistent outflows can pressure the underlying asset, Ethereum, by reducing the direct buying pressure that ETFs are supposed to provide. However, the crypto market is influenced by a wider array of factors, including decentralized finance (DeFi) activity, network upgrades, and global macro trends. The key takeaway is to monitor whether this outflow trend reverses or continues. A reversal would suggest a temporary rebalancing. A continuation might indicate deeper concerns about near-term Ethereum valuation or competition from other asset classes. Investors should view ETF flow data as one metric among many, integrating it with their own research and risk tolerance. Navigating the Current Spot ETH ETF Landscape The current environment demands a measured approach. The spot ETH ETFs’ struggle to gather net new assets in recent days highlights the difference between product launch excitement and sustained adoption. For the market to view these ETFs as a resounding success, they need to demonstrate an ability to attract consistent inflows over time, similar to their Bitcoin ETF counterparts. Actionable insight: Watch for a break in the outflow streak. The first day of net inflows after this seven-day period will be a critical psychological moment for the market. It could signal that selling pressure has been exhausted and a new phase of accumulation may begin. Conclusion: A Test for Ethereum’s Institutional Appeal The seventh straight day of net outflows, totaling $75.4 million, presents a clear test for the spot ETH ETF narrative. While concerning, the isolated nature of the outflows to BlackRock’s fund provides a nuanced picture. The coming weeks will be telling. Will these products become a steady conduit for institutional capital into Ethereum, or will they struggle to find their footing? The answer will significantly influence Ethereum’s price discovery and its perception as a mature institutional asset. For now, investors should stay informed, avoid reactionary decisions based on short-term flow data, and focus on the long-term fundamentals of the Ethereum network. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What are spot ETH ETFs? A1: Spot ETH ETFs are exchange-traded funds that hold actual Ethereum (ETH). They trade on traditional stock exchanges, allowing investors to gain exposure to Ethereum’s price without directly buying or storing the cryptocurrency. Q2: Why are the spot ETH ETFs seeing net outflows? A2> Potential reasons include investors taking profits after earlier price increases, year-end portfolio rebalancing, broader crypto market uncertainty, or specific arbitrage activities related to the ETF’s market price versus its net asset value. Q3: Does this mean Ethereum is a bad investment? A3: Not necessarily. ETF flows are a short-term indicator of demand for a specific financial product. Ethereum’s long-term value depends on network adoption, technology upgrades, and broader crypto market dynamics, not solely on ETF flows. Q4: Should I sell my spot ETH ETF shares because of this news? A4: Investment decisions should be based on your individual financial goals, risk tolerance, and time horizon, not on a single week of flow data. Consider consulting a financial advisor for personalized advice. Q5: How can I track spot ETH ETF flows myself? A5: Data is reported by issuers and aggregated by financial data firms like TraderT, Bloomberg, and Farside Investors. Many crypto news websites provide daily or weekly summaries of these flows. Q6: Did all spot ETH ETFs have outflows? A6: No. On December 19th, only BlackRock’s ETHA reported net outflows. All other spot ETH ETFs, such as those from Fidelity, Grayscale, and others, reported zero net flows for that day.

This uptick follows a concerning dip below the crucial $120 level, which had sparked fears of a potential downtrend that could drag the cryptocurrency down toward the $100 threshold. Solana Price Gains Ground Chris MacDonald, an analyst at The Motley Fool, recently highlighted two key factors contributing to Solana’s resurgence. One significant catalyst is a proactive initiative by the Solana Foundation. Bitcoinist reported earlier this week that the organization is currently assessing whether its network can withstand potential threats from quantum computing technologies. Related Reading: Bitwise’s 2026 Crypto Forecast: Bitcoin, Ethereum, And Solana Poised For New Record Highs In collaboration with Project Eleven, a security firm specializing in post-quantum cryptography, the Solana team has launched a quantum-resistant testnet following a comprehensive threat assessment. The second notable factor driving the Solana price uptick is the announcement from health and wellness company Mangoceuticals, which revealed plans to allocate $100 million toward acquiring and holding SOL. Despite the positive momentum, experts caution that Solana’s price is currently following a “clean corrective structure.” Moving Averages Signal Downtrend From a technical analysis perspective, the 50-day simple moving average (SMA) is situated around $143, significantly higher than the current trading range, while the 200-day SMA looms even further at approximately $170, suggesting a prevailing downtrend rather than a healthy consolidation phase. In the short term, the 20-day exponential moving average has also rolled over near $133 and has consistently rejected previous attempts at a bounce. Analysts note that until the Solana price can close above the low-$130s for an extended period, any rebounds will likely be seen merely as counter-trend movements. Immediate support lies just below current trading levels at the $125 mark, followed by critical levels in the $121–$120 range, and another demand zone around $110. A more significant downturn could push the price into the high $90s, with projections indicating a potential dip to around $80 if liquidations accelerate further, as NewsBTC reported on Thursday. Related Reading: Crypto Payments Firm MoonPay Set For $5 Billion Valuation With NYSE Owner’s Backing The market has already registered an eight-month low near $116.9. A decisive close beneath that level could likely drag the Solana price toward the psychologically significant $100 mark. On the upside, the Solana price could encounter initial resistance clustered in the $133–$138 range, with stronger resistance observed in higher levels between $144 and $147 that could prevent any new recoveries in the short-term. To facilitate further price recovery, the Solana price will need to clear that second group of resistance levels on a daily close, ideally supported by increased trading volume, to pave the way toward prices between $160 and $165.

56073550,647261,1766210427,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/56073550.jpeg,Polish Parliament Slams The Brakes On Crypto Market Act After Controversial Revival,https://bitcoinist.com/poland-delay-crypto-act-controversial-revival/,"Polish lawmakers have reportedly halted discussions on crypto legislations until January after the parliament’s lower house, the Sejm, voted to pass a nearly identical version of a bill that was vetoed by Poland’s president earlier this month without changes. Poland’s Sejm Passes Controversial Crypto Bill On Friday, local news media outlets informed that the Polish Senate hit the brakes on the controversial Crypto-Asset Market Act, following the Sejm’s recent vote to pass “version 2.0” of the legislation. According to the reports, more than half of the members of the lower chamber voted to pass the revived version of the bill on Thursday, leaving its fate in the hands of the Senate and then the President, who has strongly opposed to the legislation. As reported by Bitcoinist, Poland’s President Karol Nawrocki vetoed the Crypto-Asset Market Act at the start of the month due to concerns of a potential exodus of startups and overregulating the sector with the “legal mess” proposed by the Polish government. On December 1, President Nawrocki refused to sign the bill, first introduced in June, which aimed to establish strict rules on the crypto assets market. He argued that the legislation it could pose a real threat to the freedoms of Poles, the stability of the state, and market innovation. The local crypto community had raised concerns about the bill in September, affirming that it exceeded the European Union (EU)’s minimum regulatory requirements and could drive small businesses and startups abroad. The parliament attempted to override the President’s veto, but ultimately failed after being unable to secure the required three-fifths majority vote to overturn the presidential decision. Nonetheless, the part of the ruling coalition in the Sejm reintroduced the bill a week later without allegedly amending any of the controversial policies, raising more concerns among crypto industry players and community members. Senate Delays Decision Until January According to the reports, the Senate had initially planned to pass the bill “at an express pace” before the end of the year. However, the Deputy Finance Minister Jurand Drop raised concerns about the intention to pass the legislation with no further revisions. Deputy Minister Drop pointed out that the Sejm had introduced only one change to the proposal, a lower fee for entities intermediating in crypto trading, despite the government’s disapproval of the current text. “This amendment, which was introduced during the Sejm vote and which the government disagrees with, concerns the level of fees paid to the Polish Financial Supervision Authority (KNF) by entities in the crypto-asset market. The fee has been reduced from 0.4% to 0.1%,” Drop explained. “Other market segments have fees of a maximum of 0.5%; for this market, the government has proposed 0.4%. Although the KNF’s projections indicate that these fees will not exceed 0.1%, and in the first year, they will not be collected at all, the question remains what will happen if this market grows and, as a result, the fees are forced to exceed 0.1%,” he added. On Friday morning, the Senate Budget and Public Finance Committee discussed the recently passed bill and the Ministry of Finance’s concerns. The committee chairman, Senator Kazimierz Kleina, suggested that the committee review this modification calmly. Therefore, he withdrew the motion to pass the bill without new changes and suspended the discussions on the bill, affirming that the Sejm’s amendments “will have to be carefully considered.” Ultimately, Chairman Kleina scheduled to resume work on the legislation during the January Senate session.",Crypto News|bitcoin|btc|BTCUSDT|crypto asset market act|Crypto Bill|Crypto legislation|Crypto market bill|MiCA regulation|poland|Poland crypto bill|Poland president|Polish lawmakers,EN,0,0,BTC|MARKET|REGULATION|TRADING|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-12-20 06:00:27

The company mined an impressive 144.1 BTC, showcasing the relentless pace of the global Bitcoin mining industry. However, this news comes with a twist: they sold nearly all of it. Let’s dig into what these numbers really mean for the market and for investors watching the space. What Do Bitdeer’s Latest Bitcoin Mining Numbers Reveal? Bitdeer’s announcement on X provides a transparent snapshot of its operations. The firm mined 144.1 BTC over a recent seven-day period. During that same week, it sold 141.5 BTC. This activity leaves Bitdeer with a net treasury of 1,996.7 BTC as of December 19th. This pattern of high-volume mining followed by immediate selling is a crucial business strategy. It highlights how major players manage cash flow and hedge against market volatility. This approach to Bitcoin mining is not just about creating new coins; it’s a sophisticated balance of production and treasury management. Companies like Bitdeer must cover enormous operational costs, primarily electricity. Therefore, selling a large portion of their mined Bitcoin is often necessary to fund ongoing operations and expansion. It’s a reminder that mining is both a technological feat and a complex financial enterprise. Why Is Selling Mined Bitcoin So Common? You might wonder why a company would go through the effort of Bitcoin mining only to sell the rewards immediately. The answer lies in economics. The process is incredibly energy-intensive. To stay profitable, miners must convert a portion of their Bitcoin into fiat currency to pay for: Electricity bills , which are their single largest expense. Hardware maintenance and upgrades to stay competitive. Facility costs and staff salaries . Expansion plans to increase future mining capacity. Therefore, selling 141.5 BTC out of a 144.1 BTC haul is a standard practice for ensuring liquidity. It’s a sign of a mature, financially disciplined operation rather than a lack of belief in Bitcoin’s long-term value. Bitdeer’s decision to retain a sizable treasury of nearly 2,000 BTC shows they maintain significant exposure to the asset’s potential appreciation. What Does This Mean for the Broader Bitcoin Mining Landscape? Bitdeer’s weekly report acts as a microcosm of the entire Bitcoin mining sector. The ability to consistently produce over 140 BTC per week positions them as a major industrial player. This level of output requires immense computational power and strategic planning. For individual investors, it underscores the scale of professional mining, which is far removed from the early days of hobbyist miners. The company’s actions also provide subtle insights into market sentiment. A steady, planned sell-off suggests a focus on operational stability. However, if many large miners simultaneously increase their selling pressure, it can temporarily affect Bitcoin’s market price. Observing these corporate treasury movements has become a key part of analyzing crypto market dynamics. Key Takeaways from Bitdeer’s Strategic Moves Bitdeer’s latest figures offer more than just a production update. They reveal a clear and disciplined corporate strategy. The company is executing a model of high-efficiency Bitcoin mining coupled with prudent financial management. For anyone interested in the crypto economy, this demonstrates how the industry is professionalizing. The days of mining being an obscure niche are over; it is now a serious, data-driven industrial sector. In conclusion, Bitdeer’s weekly performance is a testament to the robust infrastructure supporting Bitcoin. The firm mines at scale, manages its assets strategically, and maintains transparency with its announcements. This operational rhythm is essential for the security and continued growth of the Bitcoin network itself. As the industry evolves, the strategies of leading miners like Bitdeer will continue to shape the ecosystem. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) How much Bitcoin did Bitdeer mine this week? Bitdeer mined 144.1 Bitcoin during the reported week. Why did Bitdeer sell most of the Bitcoin it mined? The company likely sold 141.5 BTC to cover operational costs like electricity, hardware maintenance, and other expenses, a common practice for large-scale miners to ensure business liquidity. How much Bitcoin does Bitdeer still hold in its treasury? As of December 19th, after its recent sales, Bitdeer holds a net balance of 1,996.7 Bitcoin in its corporate treasury. What is Bitcoin cloud mining? Bitcoin cloud mining allows individuals or companies to participate in mining by renting hashing power from a provider like Bitdeer, without needing to buy and maintain their own physical mining hardware. Do large mining sales affect Bitcoin’s price? While large, coordinated sell-offs from multiple miners can create temporary selling pressure, routine sales from single entities like Bitdeer are typically absorbed by the market and are part of normal ecosystem liquidity. Is Bitcoin mining still profitable? Profitability depends heavily on electricity costs, hardware efficiency, and Bitcoin’s market price. For large, professionally-run operations like Bitdeer with access to cheap power and efficient equipment, it can be a viable business.

The emphasis of the post is not on short-term price movements, but on how legislation such as the proposed Clarity Act may redefine how certain digital assets are evaluated within professional investment portfolios. According to the perspective presented, regulatory certainty is positioned as a turning point that could materially expand the practical use and acceptance of XRP. Teucrium CEO Sal Gilbertie on $XRP Once the Clarity Act comes in, the use case skyrockets. @GilbertieSal says assets with real utility like $XRP will be taken very seriously in portfolios, alongside BTC as digital gold. He also notes we’re still at the tip of the iceberg, with… pic.twitter.com/JwYfht1JIR — Xaif Crypto| (@Xaif_Crypto) December 17, 2025 Use Case as a Core Investment Consideration Gilbertie’s remarks, as highlighted in the post and accompanying video, stress the importance of real-world utility when assessing digital assets. He contrasts Bitcoin’s role as a store-of-value asset with other tokens that are designed for functional applications within financial and technological systems. In this framework, XRP is grouped with assets that serve operational purposes rather than purely speculative ones. The argument put forward is that once clearer regulatory standards are established, such assets are likely to be taken more seriously by asset managers seeking diversified exposure within the digital asset space. Institutional Portfolios and ETF Expectations A central point raised in the tweet is the expectation that regulatory clarity would accelerate interest in XRP-related exchange-traded products . Gilbertie suggests that single-asset XRP ETFs could attract significantly broader participation once legal uncertainties are reduced. From this standpoint, current capital inflows are described as preliminary, suggesting that the market is still in an early phase. The notion that billions of dollars could eventually enter XRP-focused investment vehicles is presented as a reflection of pent-up institutional demand rather than speculative optimism. Positioning XRP Alongside Established Digital Assets The commentary also places XRP within a portfolio construction narrative. While Bitcoin is characterized as occupying a distinct role comparable to digital gold, assets with defined use cases are portrayed as complementary rather than competing components. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 In this context, XRP is described as a candidate for serious allocation once regulations align with its operational design. The post describes this as part of a gradual layering process, where institutional portfolios evolve to include multiple categories of digital assets based on function and risk profile. Skepticism Within the Community A comment cited from an X user questions whether regulatory developments will meaningfully change outcomes, pointing to XRP’s long trading history and its failure to surpass previous price thresholds. This counterpoint reflects a segment of the market that remains unconvinced that legislative clarity alone will translate into sustained valuation gains. Overall, the tweet shared by Xaif Crypto presents Gilbertie’s outlook on XRP as a long-term belief grounded in regulation, utility , and institutional behavior.

56075894,https://cryptonews.com/?p=466403,1766213871,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/52/56075894.jpeg,Blockstream CEO Adam Back Slams Nic Carter Over Bitcoin Quantum Threat Claims,https://cryptonews.com/news/blockstream-ceo-adam-back-slams-nic-carter-over-bitcoin-quantum-threat-claims/,"Blockstream CEO Adam Back has publicly pushed back against claims that Bitcoin faces an imminent threat from quantum computing, criticizing Castle Island Ventures founding partner Nic Carter for amplifying those concerns in the open. Key Takeaways: Adam Back says Bitcoin’s quantum risk is being addressed quietly, without public alarm. Nic Carter argues the threat is real and says many developers remain in denial. The debate reflects a split over how urgent quantum computing risks are for Bitcoin. The exchange unfolded on X after Carter explained why Castle Island Ventures invested in Project Eleven, a startup focused on developing defenses against potential quantum attacks on Bitcoin and other crypto networks. Back responded sharply, accusing Carter of stirring unnecessary alarm. “You make uninformed noise and try to move the market or something. You’re not helping,” Back wrote in a post on Friday. Adam Back Says Bitcoin Developers Are Quietly Preparing for Quantum Risks Back argued that the Bitcoin ecosystem is not ignoring the long-term risks posed by quantum computing. Instead, he said developers and researchers are already working on potential protections, but prefer to do so without turning the issue into a public spectacle. In his view, the discussion has become distorted by exaggeration rather than grounded technical assessment. Carter rejected that characterization, saying a significant portion of the Bitcoin community remains unwilling to seriously confront the issue. He claimed many developers are still in “total denial” about the possibility that sufficiently powerful quantum machines could, one day, undermine Bitcoin’s cryptographic foundations. While the investment itself only recently resurfaced in online debates, Carter noted that he disclosed Castle Island’s backing of Project Eleven weeks earlier. Others are working on it, and not everyone can work on it as it's cryptography and newer algorithms. As you may know @Blockstream research has been driving and collaborating on Bitcoin related crypto like Schnorr, MuSig, Taproot etc for years. And so it is now with PQ and others — Adam Back (@adam3us) December 19, 2025 In an Oct. 20 Substack post, he said the disclosure was made upfront. “I disclosed this in the first sentence of my main article on quantum. Can’t get more transparent than that,” Carter said. Carter described himself as having been “quantum pilled” by Project Eleven CEO Alex Pruden, saying the conversations convinced him that quantum computing poses a serious, if not immediate, risk to blockchain systems. “I became extremely concerned about quantum threats to blockchains. I put capital behind my convictions, always have,” he said, adding that he expected criticism and made his financial exposure clear in advance. In laying out his case, Carter pointed to governments preparing for a post-quantum world, rising investment in quantum firms, and the idea that Bitcoin itself could act as a powerful incentive for breakthroughs in quantum technology. Bitcoin Quantum Debate Deepens as Timelines and Risks Divide Investors The debate extends beyond Back and Carter. Capriole Investments founder Charles Edwards recently warned that quantum computing could become a real threat to Bitcoin within two to nine years unless the network upgrades to quantum-resistant cryptography. Others remain skeptical. Multimillionaire investor Kevin O’Leary has argued that using quantum machines to attack Bitcoin would be a poor use of the technology, suggesting far greater value lies in fields like medical research and artificial intelligence. Back has acknowledged the importance of preparing Bitcoin to be “quantum ready,” but maintains that practical threats remain decades away, describing the technology as still “ridiculously early” and constrained by major research hurdles.

Ethereum Beats Bitcoin, Dogecoin, & Others In Total Amount Of Holders In a new post on X, Santiment has talked about where the Total Amount of Holders indicator stands for Bitcoin, Dogecoin, and other coins in the cryptocurrency sector today. This metric measures, as its name suggests, the total number of addresses carrying a non-empty balance on a given network. When the value of this indicator rises, it can be a sign that new investors are joining the blockchain and/or old investors who sold earlier are making a return. The trend can also arise from existing holders creating multiple wallets for accounting or privacy purposes. In general, all of these factors can be assumed to simultaneously be in action whenever the Total Amount of Holders registers an increase. As such, some net adoption of the cryptocurrency can be considered to have occurred. On the other hand, the metric going down implies some investors have cleaned out their wallet balances, potentially because they have decided to exit the blockchain. Now, here is the chart shared by Santiment that shows the trend in the Total Amount of Holders for eight different cryptocurrencies: As displayed in the above graph, Ethereum is the most dominant cryptocurrency in terms of the Total Amount of Holders, with the metric sitting at 167.96 million. Bitcoin, the next largest network, only hosts a userbase that’s a third of ETH’s (about 57.62 million addresses). Ethereum’s dominance could be down to the fact that the blockchain hosts a vibrant ecosystem of layer two blockchains and decentralized finance (DeFi) applications, made possible by its smart-contracts system. The gulf between Bitcoin and third place is again massive, with the stablecoin USDT having 9.63 million non-empty wallets. From USDT on, however, the altcoins are much closer to each other. Dogecoin and XRP are the cryptocurrencies with the fourth and fifth largest holder counts on the list with the indicator having a value of 8.13 million and 7.41 million, respectively. From the chart, it’s visible that while Bitcoin has seen a more or less flat trajectory in the Total Amount of Holders during the last year, Ethereum has only been witnessing growth, extending its lead. The adoption trend for ETH is also visible from another indicator shared by the analytics firm, known as the Network Growth . This metric keeps track of the new addresses appearing on the blockchain. As is apparent from the chart, the Ethereum Network Growth has spiked recently. “The #2 market cap is seeing an average of 163K new addresses per day, compared to 124K in July,” noted Santiment. BTC Price At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading around $87,500, down 2% over the last week.",Bitcoin News|bitcoin|Bitcoin Total Amount of Holders|btc|Doge|dogecoin|ETH|Ethereum|ETHUSDT,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|DOGE|ETH|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-12-20 07:00:41

The company’s analysts said that the NVDA stock now sits at 25-times forward earnings, which drops it into the 11th percentile of its valuation range over the past decade. That alone is wild. It gets even wilder when you add that Nvidia is also trading at a 13% discount to the PHLX Semiconductor Sector Index, which almost never happens. Bernstein said Nvidia has only reached valuation levels this low on 13 trading days across ten full years. Analyst Stacy Rasgon put it simply in the note: “25 P/FE may not seem particularly cheap for your ordinary stock. But this is NVIDIA.” The stock is still up 34% in 2025, beating the S&P 500’s 16% gain, but it trails the PHLX Semiconductor Index, which is up 41% this year. Nvidia has also slipped about 7% over the last month as investors freak out about heavy spending and demand questions around GPUs. But its earnings keep beating expectations, and that is why Bernstein said the stock remains a buy heading into the new year. Rasgon wrote , “While we understand some of the AI angst that has affected the sector lately, we believe Nvidia is set up well into the new year,” adding that “investors buying Nvidia’s stock at current levels have historically done very well.” Bernstein kept its outperform rating and set a $275 price target for the stock. Regulators clear Intel deal as Nvidia pushes deeper into the chip race U.S. antitrust agencies cleared Nvidia’s $5 billion investment in Intel, which was first announced in September, according to a notice posted by the Federal Trade Commission. Meanwhile, investors have spent months worrying about Nvidia’s high capital spending tied to massive GPU buildouts, but the Intel investment proves that Jensen Huang is still stacking alliances, boosting capacity, and making sure he does not lose ground in the semiconductor race. Nvidia also picked up support from Tigress Financial Partners, which raised its price target to $350 and kept a Strong Buy rating. Tigress said Nvidia still holds a leading role in full-stack AI systems, accelerated computing, and growth areas like robotics, medical imaging, and autonomous driving. That $350 target now sits at the top end of Wall Street estimates. Numbers from Yahoo Finance show an average price target around $195, with analyst expectations ranging from $140 to $352.

Cynthia Lummis is walking away from Washington after one term, and yeah, that is a big deal for anyone who cares about crypto, tech, AI, or just anything tied to Wyoming’s odd power in the Senate. In a statement released by her office on Friday, Cynthia said she will retire when her term ends in early 2027. She tied the choice to the heavy workload during the shutdown fight and said the long grind no longer matches her energy level. Cynthia said, “Deciding not to run for re-election does represent a change of heart for me,” and added that the intense session this fall made her accept that she does not “have six more years” in her. She also said she felt like a “sprinter in a marathon,” and the energy for another full term “doesn’t match up.” Lummis came to the Senate in 2020 after years in the House. She sits on the Banking Committee, and many in the crypto world know her for pushing a light federal hand on digital assets. Thank you, Wyoming! Serving our state has been the honor of my life. – Cynthia Lummis pic.twitter.com/FoRTlHaHxI — Cynthia Lummis 🦬 (@CynthiaMLummis) December 19, 2025 She once sat with the House Freedom Caucus and stuck with a tight fiscal line in the Senate, always pressing for cuts to federal spending. She was also one of the GOP senators whose phone records were taken during special counsel Jack Smith’s investigation of the Jan. 6 attack by Trump supporters. Her seat remains a safe one for Republicans, so the party will not be sweating the odds in 2026. Cynthia Lummis is crypto’s biggest ever ally in US Congress During her time in office, Cynthia pushed several major tech bills. She worked on crypto rules and took a lead role in early discussions on artificial intelligence oversight. This year she introduced a bill that would protect AI companies from certain liability cases as long as they met specific disclosure rules. Cynthia also shared her concerns when President Trump met privately with investors involved in his $TRUMP meme token project. She wanted more clarity around that meeting and joined other GOP senators in bringing it up inside the party. Sen. John Barrasso, R-Wyo., said, “Cynthia is a straight shooter and a trailblazer,” and pointed to her energy inside the Senate. Alex Latcham, a senior figure at the Senate Leadership Fund, also weighed in and said she “will be missed.” Barrasso thanked her for her work for Wyoming and said her record as a conservative is solid. He linked her time in office to digital currency progress and energy policy, saying she helped push the United States into a leadership role in those areas. Who will take over from Lummis? With Cynthia leaving her seat open, Wyoming Republicans are already lining up. The state leans deep red. Trump won it by over 45 points in 2024, and Cynthia won her own 2020 race by over 46 points. Whoever wins the GOP primary will almost certainly win the general. Two sources allegedly told NBC News that Rep. Harriet Hageman is likely to run. Hageman is 63 and knocked out former Rep. Liz Cheney in the 2022 primary. Her advisor, Tim Murtaugh, said Hageman will “have an announcement next week,” hinting that she is ready to move toward the Senate. Hageman also spoke about Cynthia’s time in office, saying: “Senator Lummis has been a trailblazer for Wyoming and has been key in educating other members of Congress, including other Republicans, about what life is like in our Western states.” She added that Cynthia made sure lawmakers understood how decisions in Washington landed on people in the West. She also said, “There can be no question that the people of Wyoming are better off for having had Cynthia Lummis on their side.” Sharpen your strategy with mentorship + daily ideas - 30 days free access to our trading program",News|USD,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|EXCHANGE|REGULATION|TRADING|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-12-20 07:20:36

The transaction, involving 202,077 ZEC valued at a staggering $88.28 million, represents one of the most significant single movements of the privacy-focused coin this year. This event coincides with ZEC’s price surging over 12%, prompting urgent questions about the motives behind such a colossal transfer and its potential impact on the market’s future. What Does This Massive ZEC Whale Withdrawal Mean? The scale of this ZEC whale withdrawal is impossible to ignore. Moving nearly $90 million worth of assets off a major exchange like Binance typically signals a strategic shift in holding behavior. Therefore, analysts are scrutinizing this action for clues. Is this a single large investor, often called a ‘whale,’ or an institutional player moving funds into cold storage for long-term safekeeping? The timing is particularly intriguing, as ZEC’s price jumped to $447.7 following the news, suggesting the market interprets this as a bullish, confidence-driven move rather than a preparation for a sell-off. Why Are Whale Movements So Critical for Zcash? Whale transactions serve as a powerful barometer for cryptocurrency health. For a coin like Zcash (ZEC), which emphasizes privacy, large movements can be especially telling. Here are the key implications of this ZEC whale withdrawal : Reduced Exchange Supply: Taking 202,077 ZEC off Binance directly reduces the immediately sellable supply on that platform, which can create upward price pressure if demand remains steady. Long-Term Confidence: Withdrawing to a private wallet often indicates a plan to hold, or ‘HODL,’ reflecting strong belief in the asset’s future value. Market Sentiment Driver: Such a public, high-value move can influence retail investor sentiment, often triggering follow-on buying or selling activity. ZEC Price Action: More Than Just a Coincidence? The reported 12.23% price increase for ZEC is not happening in a vacuum. While correlation doesn’t equal causation, major ZEC whale withdrawal events frequently precede or accompany significant price movements. This activity suggests that large, informed players may be positioning themselves ahead of anticipated positive developments for Zcash or the broader privacy coin sector. However, retail investors should proceed with caution, as whale actions can also precede volatility. Navigating the Waves: What Should Investors Do? For observers and ZEC holders, this event is a masterclass in market dynamics. First, it underscores the importance of monitoring blockchain analytics and exchange flow data. Second, it highlights that Zcash remains a significant asset capable of attracting nine-figure investments. While you should never blindly follow whale trades, understanding their potential motives—such as anticipation of regulatory clarity for privacy coins or technological upgrades—can provide valuable context for your own investment strategy. In conclusion, the $88.28 million ZEC whale withdrawal from Binance is a profound market signal. It demonstrates sustained institutional-level interest in privacy-preserving cryptocurrencies and has already catalyzed positive price action. This move reinforces Zcash’s position as a major player and reminds us that in the crypto ocean, the whales often dictate the current. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q: What is a ‘whale’ in cryptocurrency? A: A ‘whale’ is an individual or entity that holds a large enough amount of a specific cryptocurrency that their trades can potentially influence the market price. Q: Why would a whale withdraw ZEC from an exchange? A: Primary reasons include moving funds to more secure cold storage for long-term holding, preparing to use the funds in a private transaction (leveraging ZEC’s privacy features), or simply consolidating assets. Q: Does a large withdrawal always mean the price will go up? A: Not always. While it often reduces immediate sell pressure and can be seen as bullish, it depends on the whale’s ultimate intent. It is one signal among many to consider. Q: How can I track whale movements like this? A: You can use blockchain explorers for transparent chains or subscribe to analytics platforms and news services that monitor large transactions and exchange flows. Q: What makes ZEC different from other cryptocurrencies? A: Zcash (ZEC) is a privacy-focused cryptocurrency. It uses advanced cryptography (zk-SNARKs) to allow users to shield transaction details, offering optional privacy for sender, receiver, and amount. Q: Is this withdrawal related to ZEC’s recent price increase? A> It is likely a contributing factor. The market often views large exchange withdrawals as a sign of accumulation, which can boost buyer confidence and drive price appreciation, as seen with the 12% rise.

As the speculative fervor continues to die down and the flow of funding continues to become specially discerning, it is being noticed that investors are progressively moving away from coins and tokens that have no fundamental backing and are being increasingly drawn towards those coins and tokens that provide special value in terms of their burgeoning growth and development stages. This has brought Mutuum Finance (MUTM) , into the special limelight as the top crypto to invest in, especially for those who might be looking for an option other than the popular but often meme coins that have long since lost steam and gained popularity merely as a result of the hype they generated during the days of yore and have been languishing ever since. Presently priced at $0.035, MUTM is a new crypto coin that has been brought into the marketplace and is currently hard at work in the sixth phase of its presale, which is more than 95% completed and awaiting a price rise as it becomes one of the most sought-after cryptocurrencies. It has been able to garner funding to the tune of $20 million and boasts a rather whopping count of no less than 18,530+ unique holders and a special focus and concentration upon a decentralized lending and borrowing system. Dogecoin Stabilizes After Liquidity Sweep, Relief Bounce Possible Dogecoin (DOGE) has finalized a strong sweep of its liquidity and has cleared the downtrend that had persisted for quite some time, thereby removing the weaker investors around the lows. The coin has now largely established a support level, and if this trend sticks, then a relief rally could be expected soon, wherein the next level of resistance may come into focus. As Dogecoin moves along in the process of a recovery, investors have largely set their sights elsewhere, where the early adaptability and usability that DeFi cryptos like Mutuum Finance (MUTM) offer have caught their interest. Investors seeking the top crypto to invest in have particularly noticed MUTM’s momentum. MUTM Presale Phase 6 Approaches Full Allocations Mutuum Finance is quickly making a name for itself as one of the top DeFi cryptos in the market as it nears the completion of Phase 6 of its presale. The token price is currently set at $0.035, which is the last chance for investors to get onboard before moving into Phase 7, during which the price will rise by 20% to $0.04. With more than 18,530 participants contributing over $19.5 million, the success of the presale, along with the real use cases of the DeFi platform, makes MUTM a new crypto coin with strong upside potential. Conducting a Security Audit by Halborn Security has remained one of the key focuses for Mutuum Finance. The lending and borrowing smart contracts for the lending platform are undergoing an independent audit by Halborn Security one of the top auditing companies for the blockchain industry. The audit ensures that all contracts work correctly and that the security of the users’ funds is not breached. The announcement of the testnet will follow the audit, which will grant early access users the chance to test the platform. Community Incentives Mutuum Finance embraces community engagement with tailored reward programs. Early supporters of Mutuum Finance are eligible for a chance to participate in a $100,000 giveaway , with ten lucky winners receiving ten prizes of $10,000 each in the form of MUTM tokens. In addition to incentivizing supporters to use the platform, this approach clearly sets MUTM apart as the top crypto to invest in with high likelihood of adoption and success based on its strategic approach to transparency and engagement with users. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has surpassed 98% completion of Presale Stage 6 at $0.035, accumulating over 18,530+ holders and close to $19.5M. Presale Stage 7 will hike prices to $0.04, marking the last opportunity for those who are still waiting to join Mutuum Finance. All in all, MUTM brings valuable utility, massive growth opportunities, robust protection as a result of a Halborn audit, and rewards worth $100K, establishing it as the new crypto coin with real-world functionality and making it the top crypto to invest in today.

The company rolled out this new hardware only weeks after its stock jumped five-fold, and Zhang used the Beijing event to push a clear message: developers in China should not have to wait for foreign tech to move forward. “These products will significantly enhance world-class computing speed and capabilities that all developers aspire to,” he said, adding that he wants local teams to build without waiting for outside supply. “We hope they can meet the needs of more developers in China so that you no longer need to wait for advanced foreign products.” China’s chipmakers are getting heavy attention as the government pushes for a strong semiconductor base, and investors are betting that firms like Moore Threads can stand up to Nvidia at a time when US export bans block the most advanced chips from reaching China . Zhang said the new Huagang architecture boosts computing density by 50% and lifts energy efficiency by ten times, giving local developers more room to work with large models without depending on outside hardware. Chips made on this design will fall under the Huashan line and target the same category as Nvidia’s Hopper and Blackwell units. Building hardware shifts across China’s chip sector Moore Threads went public in Shanghai literally this month and saw its shares jump more than five-fold, followed by domestic rival MetaX Integrated Circuits posting a strong debut days later. Zhang founded Moore Threads back in 2020 after 14 years at Nvidia , where he served as China general manager and helped build the local ecosystem he now wants to replace. Before Nvidia, Zhang’s path took him through roles at Hewlett-Packard and Dell, and before that, he started as a senior researcher at the Metallurgy Automation Research & Design Institute in 1990. The company said it expects mass production in 2026, with the new technology able to support clusters of over 100,000 chips inside data centers for AI training. Moore Threads first made money from gaming and visual rendering chips, and later switched to AI accelerators as demand for local options grew. At the same event, the company rolled out an update to its MUSA computing platform, calling it an equivalent to CUDA, and introduced servers that can link tens of thousands of AI chips, even after being blacklisted by the US in 2023. Expanding product lines across local hardware Moore Threads also unveiled the Lushan GPU series for graphics rendering and launched the Changjiang SoC, which puts CPUs and GPUs on the same chip. Analysts watching China’s market say the strong share moves may come from excitement rather than fundamentals. “In the context of the US-China tech war, valuations in the A-share market have detached from reality, driven by politics rather than logic,” said Shen Meng of Chanson & Co. He added that many of these companies act as political symbols and show limited real impact on core technology. Zhang said “policy support is the ‘booster’ for strategic high-tech breakthroughs,” pointing to the capital-heavy nature of chips. The company’s filings show Moore Threads expects to turn a profit by 2027. Duncan Clark, Chairman of BDA China, said this is a “domestic substitution play,” noting that China’s push for local chips gives Moore Threads a clear path since government-backed buyers must source hardware domestically, including sectors like the military.

Customs data also showed the US receiving 582 tons, down from 656 tons the month before. This decline came even as a separate release reported month-on-month growth in overall rare-earth sales, which are mainly made up of magnets. The split numbers added more weight to how unstable this trade lane has been all year. Rare-earth magnets sit inside EV motors, drones, and military systems, and Beijing treated them like a pressure tool throughout the year. In April, officials rolled out a tighter export-control system that pushed US-bound flows below 50 tons in May. Later months saw back-and-forth trade actions, brief truces, and then a slow pickup in shipments, bringing exports back toward usual ranges before November’s pullback. Meanwhile, China’s Commerce Ministry said it approved many general licenses meant to fast-track rare-earth exports, and shorten wait times for companies that meet the conditions. When Hong Kong reporters asked about claims that some approvals covered European companies, a ministry spokesperson kept the response narrow and said applications were approved without naming any region. The spokesperson allegedly said, “Some exporters have already preliminarily met the basic requirements for applying for a general license,” adding that officials already accepted and approved multiple submissions. The ministry said these licenses form a new tool for exporters of vital elements, including magnets, which have dominated the rare-earth category for years. Officials also said more exporters are expected to apply once they meet the criteria. Traders said the new permit lane may help reduce delays, though it will depend on how many companies qualify. Holding lending rates steady while the economy slows A Reuters survey said China’s central bank plans to keep benchmark lending rates unchanged in December for the seventh month in a row. All 25 respondents expected the one-year loan prime rate to stay at 3.0% and the five-year rate at 3.5%. The view followed the central bank’s move this month to leave its seven-day reverse repo rate at 1.4%, which supports LPR levels. LPRs are calculated each month from proposed rates submitted by 20 commercial banks to the Chinese central bank. Factory output and retail sales slowed in November as China’s property slump weighed on demand. The country recorded a trade surplus above $1 trillion in the first eleven months of 2025, but exporters are bracing for a tough 2026 as trade tensions build. A Shanghai bank trader said banks face record-low net interest margins of 1.42% and allegedly warned that:- “A cut in LPR now would mean a reduction in mortgage rates at the start of next year, which would make life more difficult for banks.” Economists reportedly believe that policymakers see no need to cut rates this month because China is still on track for its 5% growth target for 2025. Citi analysts expect the central bank to begin easing in January 2026, while ING analysts predict new support in the early part of next year. China Post Securities on Friday said officials may consider a 20-basis-point interest rate cut in the first half of 2026, and Citic Futures forecasted 10–20-basis-point cuts in 2026.

The Court’s decision reverses a 2024 court decision that scrapped it on claims of a rigged approval process. The top court didn’t deny that Tesla’s board messed up. In fact, it agreed the 2018 compensation plan was pushed through by a board way too close to Elon. Still, the justices made one thing clear: wiping the plan completely was going way too far. Their ruling: “Total rescission leaves Musk uncompensated for his time and efforts over a period of six years.” That 2018 plan gave Elon stock grants tied to Tesla hitting a long list of business targets. And boy, did he hit them. Between 2018 and 2024, Tesla’s market value exploded past $1 trillion. So now, thanks to Friday’s ruling , Elon is walking away with 303 million shares, worth nearly $150 billion at today’s prices. Delaware rejects full cancellation of Elon’s Tesla pay package The first court to rule against Elon’s pay package plan was the Delaware Court of Chancery in early 2024, where Chancellor Kathaleen McCormick ruled that Tesla’s board was too cozy with Elon and basically rubber-stamped the payout. She called him the “paradigmatic ‘Superstar CEO’” who “dominated the process.” Elon lashed out, calling the Chancellor’s decision “absolute corruption,” while the Tesla board quickly told shareholders to re-vote on the $56 billion pay plan in June 2024, hoping to fix things retroactively. More than 70% of shareholders (with majority being retailers mind you) backed it again immediately. But McCormick again in December 2024 ruled that the second vote didn’t cancel out the board’s original failure. That’s what sent the whole mess up to the state’s highest court. During a hearing two months ago, justices focused heavily on whether canceling Elon’s entire pay was too harsh. On Friday, they gave their answer: yes, it was. They said Elon delivered, and both Tesla and its shareholders benefited big time from his leadership. The board’s errors? Slapped with a symbolic fine: just $1. Tesla shareholders’ new $1 trillion plan remains on pause Before the ruling came down, Tesla’s board had already floated a brand-new pay plan for Elon—this one could hit a mind-blowing $1 trillion if all targets are met. That deal was approved in November 2025, but Tesla warned it would be scrapped if the old 2018 package was brought back to life. Now that it is, the $1 trillion package is likely dead, at least for now. Meanwhile, the lawyers who took the case to court did walk away with something. The Delaware Supreme Court awarded $54.5 million in fees to the legal team behind the lawsuit filed by shareholder Richard Tornetta. That’s a far cry from the $7 billion in Tesla stock they originally wanted. The trial court had already cut that down to $345 million, but the Supreme Court sliced it again. One Tornetta lawyer said Friday: “We thank the justices for their attention, hard work and time… and are considering our next steps.” Sounds like the war’s not over. Since all this drama started, Tesla change its incorporation to Texas, and other tech companies like Dropbox and Coinbase also ditched Delaware for states like Nevada. In response, Delaware quietly made it harder for shareholders to sue boards over massive pay deals like Elon’s.

Data from CoinMarketCap showed the leading cryptocurrency lost its support around $90,000 but repeatedly found strong buying interest near $85,000, effectively creating a volatile price range between both levels. Despite an uptick in the last day, investors’ uncertainty remains at its peak level considering a broader correction trend that has persisted since early October. Prominent market analyst Ted Pillows has identified some historical data that could guide in navigating this fragile market. Related Reading: Citi Analysts Project Bitcoin Price Could Reach $189,000 Next Year In Bullish Scenario Bitcoin To $100,000? In an X post on December 19, Pillows shares a technical analysis of Bitcoin’s price structure, projecting some significant market gains in the short-term. According to the market expert, Bitcoin is presently mirroring a 2021-2022 market setup, which suggests the asset may be headed for the $100,000 mark. In the chart below, Pillows’ annotations suggest that Bitcoin is forming a head-and-shoulders pattern. The left shoulder emerged after Bitcoin peaked at $110,000 in January 2025, followed by a rally to a new all-time high of $126,100 in October, which formed the head. Notably, a similar pattern was observed in 2021-2022, when prices reached $63,600 (left shoulder) in April 2021, $69,100 (head) in November 2021, and $48,433 (right shoulder) in March 2022 . Currently, Bitcoin appears to be in the final corrective phase ahead of the right-shoulder formation, which Pillows expects to develop near the $100,000 level, implying a potential 13.6% upside in the coming days. However, the head-and-shoulders is a bearish chart pattern, indicating that completion could initiate a cascading price fall that was similarly seen in the 2021—2022 cycle. During this time, Bitcoin’s price dropped by half, trading as low as $22,000. However, Pillows’ projections are that Bitcoin could drop by around 35% after touching the $100,000, indicating a potential bottom price target of $65,000. Interestingly, this aligns with other cautious predictions that suggest Bitcoin remains highly vulnerable to future financial trends and is likely to fall to around $70,000.

Meanwhile, investors transferred over 11,000 BTC to exchanges this week, signaling a significant selling intent amid recent price swings.

The three executives were involved in the 2022 collapse of FTX Trading Ltd. and its affiliation with the Alameda Research hedge fund. The proposed judgments were tabled by the SEC in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York on December 19, 2025. The SEC alleged that from May 2019 to November 2022, FTX and its founder, Samuel Bankman-Fried, raised over $1.8 billion from investors by representing the exchange as a secure crypto asset trading platform with advanced automated risk mitigation techniques to secure customer funds. SEC argues that Alameda received preferential treatment from FTX According to the filing tabled by the SEC with the Court for the Southern District of New York, FTX assured investors that Alameda, owned by Bankman-Fried and Wang, was an ordinary customer with no preferential treatment. SEC complaints revealed that Alameda was actually exempted from risk controls and received a virtually unlimited line of credit financed by FTX customer funds. The SEC argued that funds allocated to Alameda were used for Alameda’s trading activities, venture investments, and loans to Bankman-Fried and other executives, including Wang and Singh. The Commission further alleged that Wand and Singh were responsible for developing the software code used to divert customer funds to Alameda, with Ellison utilizing the funds for trading activities. Based on the SEC’s argument, the three executives were indeed aware of Bankman-Fried’s actions, allegedly directing additional hundreds of millions in customer funds to Alameda. The three executives, including Ellison, Wang, and Singh, consented to permanent injunctions against violating antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, and Rule 10b-5. Without denying the Commission’s allegations, the three executives agreed to five-year conduct-based injunctions. Additionally, Ellison consented to a 10-year ban from serving as an officer or director of public companies, while Wang and Singh each agreed to an eight-year ban. Previously, the three officers faced criminal charges and pleaded guilty to various counts, including fraud and conspiracy to commit fraud. The three executives cooperated with the court against Bankman-Fried’s prosecution, which resulted in a 25-year prison sentence for Bankman-Fried on seven criminal counts. Ellison, who was the key witness in the Bankman-Fried case, received a two-year prison sentence, with the option for early release. Wang and Singh, on the other hand, received sentences for time served only. Ellison moves to a community confinement program from federal prison According to a recent Cryptopolitan report , Caroline Ellison, who was considered Sam Bankman-Fried’s girlfriend, has been transferred from federal prison after serving approximately 11 months of her two-year sentence. Ellison was moved on October 16 from Danbury Federal Correctional Institute to a community confinement program. As of now, the proposed judgments, led by attorneys from the Enforcement Division of the Cyber and Emerging Technologies unit, conclude the agency’s civil proceedings against individuals connected to the FTX collapse scandal. In another related report delivered by Cryptopolitan, a class action lawsuit has also been filed against Silvergate Bank in California, inviting investors connected to FTX or Alameda Research accounts. The lawsuit invites investors who deposited fiat into an FTX or Alameda account between 2019 and 2022 to submit claims for a $10 million settlement filed in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of California. Based on the filing , investors have until January 30, 2026, to submit their claims as part of the settlement seeking to resolve the matter on whether Silvergate Bank, Silvergate Capital Corporation, and Alan J. Lane aided and abetted FTX’s fraudulent actions.

Analyst Warns of Major Crash If This Level Breaks",https://cryptopotato.com/bitcoin-to-63000-analyst-warns-of-major-crash-if-this-level-breaks/,"Bitcoin’s underwhelming price performance at the end of the year resulted in another 3% weekly decline to $88,000, even though the asset managed to recover from the drop to $84,500 earlier this week. In fact, on-chain data shared by Ali Martinez shows that this precise level is the strongest support for BTC, where nearly 400,000 units were accumulated. If broken to the downside, the next line of defense lies around $83,300. The same analyst with over 160,000 followers on X outlined the next support levels if that one cracks as well. The worst-case scenario would be a massive price drop to $63,000, which would essentially invalidate the bull market. Recall that the cryptocurrency began its ascent in Q4 last year from roughly that level. Even though it doubled in price until the following October, it has lost 30% since then, and market observers are questioning the state of the bull cycle.

The focus of the update centers on Ripple’s presence in meetings with Senator Tim Scott, alongside representatives from Coinbase and venture capital firm a16z. These talks are tied to ongoing efforts to refine a comprehensive crypto market structure framework ahead of formal negotiations expected to begin in January. The development is being framed as a meaningful step in the evolution of U.S. crypto policy, signaling increased engagement between industry participants and members of the Senate Banking Committee. Rather than operating at a distance from the legislative process, key firms are now contributing input as lawmakers consider how digital assets should be classified, supervised, and integrated into existing financial regulations.

According to the context shared, these early discussions are designed to help lawmakers understand industry perspectives before negotiations intensify. The bill is expected to address long-standing uncertainties around asset classification, regulatory oversight, and the roles of different federal agencies. Ripple’s participation is particularly notable given its extended legal history with U.S. regulators . The company’s inclusion in policy discussions suggests a willingness on the part of lawmakers to incorporate industry experience into the drafting process. For market participants, this may indicate that legislative clarity is being pursued through consultation rather than retrospective enforcement. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 What does this mean for XRP Holders and the Wider Market? The update emphasizes that XRP holders may have a direct interest in these developments, as regulatory outcomes could influence how digital assets are treated across U.S. markets. With Ripple present during early-stage policy conversations, there is a perception that stakeholder concerns are being considered at a formative stage, rather than after rules are finalized. A response shared alongside the update reinforces this view, characterizing the moment as a transition away from courtroom-centered disputes toward structured dialogue. The commentary indicates a broader shift in regulatory posture, where industry leaders are contributing to the legislative process as Congress works toward a standardized framework for digital assets. As January approaches, attention is expected to intensify around the Senate’s approach to digital asset regulation. While outcomes remain uncertain, the involvement of major industry players underscores the significance of the process.

According to Rep. Min Byoung-dug of the Democratic Party of Korea, the move will also help the country stay competitive in a rapidly changing financial system. The Korean lawmaker made this known while speaking at the final session of the eighth Global Business Forum, hosted by Herald Business in Seoul. He urged the Korean government to work with traditional financial institutions to accelerate efforts to legalize and expand the use of stablecoins in the country. The Korean lawmaker also warned that if the country delays, it could leave the vulnerable behind as global payment standards evolve. Korean lawmaker urges government to institutionalize stablecoins Min, a member of the National Assembly’s Political Affairs Committee and a key figure in Korea’s crypto policy debate, mentioned that stablecoins are now here to stay. “Stablecoins are no longer a question of whether we should do them or not,” he said. “The only question left is how fast and how well we do them.” Min described stablecoins as an inevitable tool for cross-border payments, trade settlement, and remittances. The Korean lawmaker also highlighted that stablecoin tied to the value of the United States dollar have now become tools being used in global commerce. He warned that if the Korean government fails to approve the development of a stablecoin backed by the won in time, it could lead to the erosion of monetary sovereignty. Min noted that the dollar-pegged stablecoins have now become a new form of money that governments adopt. The lawmaker highlighted the characteristics of these forms of money, noting that they are faster and cheaper when used to make cross-border transactions. Min also added that Korean companies may soon be faced with the dilemma of having to accept dollar-backed stablecoins during their trades overseas, irrespective of national policy preferences, noting that there are already signs that things are shifting in that regard domestically. Businesses are now adopting dollar-pegged stablecoins Small businesses in Korea are now paying foreign workers in dollar-based stablecoins at their request. Meanwhile, other firms are looking into using the stablecoins for international settlements. Min highlighted that these practices would soon become routine as foreign stablecoin risks become entrenched in everyday transactions before domestic rules are put in place to control their usage in specific aspects of the country. “That’s when monetary sovereignty disappears,” Min warned, adding that payment standards, once widely adopted, are difficult to reverse. Despite the growing calls for regulation in that aspect of the market, the Korean government has yet to complete its regulatory framework for digital assets. So far, authorities have focused on consumer protection and putting several anti-money laundering guardrails in place in line with the Virtual Assets User Protection Act. Policy discussions have now shifted towards more structural legislation . Regulators and lawmakers are now preparing a framework titled the Digital Asset Basic Act, which is presently in its second phase. This would formally recognize digital assets, define their legal status, and establish principles governing issuance and use beyond speculative trading. Min highlighted that in this case, a won-backed stablecoin will act as a defensive tool and a growth strategy. Min also highlighted that instead of developing a won-backed stablecoin that would compete with dollar-backed stablecoin, the Korean government should look into developing a stablecoin with different use cases that can leverage the country’s strengths. “If we make a stablecoin that’s especially useful for cultural payments or for small businesses, and turn global users into repeat customers, Korea can secure a meaningful share of the market,” he said. Also in attendance at the forum was Deputy Head of Mission Sarah McDowell of the New Zealand Embassy in Seoul. She highlighted the need to grow bilateral trade ties in her welcome address, noting that New Zealand is open and willing to do business. “Two-way trade has more than doubled since our free trade agreement entered into force ten years ago, and Korea is now New Zealand’s fifth-largest trading partner,” McDowell added.

Some previous reports indicated that she first bought bitcoin back in 2013. She continued accumulating throughout the years, with filings from 2021 showing that he bought somewhere between $50,000 and $100,000 worth of the cryptocurrency. The senator has made multiple pro-BTC comments over the years, including predicting that it will become an important player for a long time to come. More recently, she championed the idea of a US strategic Bitcoin reserve.

Hayes urges traders to reconsider their approach to altcoins and pay closer attention to new, high-performing tokens, rather than relying solely on historical trends. Hayes noted during a podcast interview with crypto enthusiast and influencer Kyle Chasse that many crypto traders are busy waiting for the next altcoin to happen, but what they fail to notice is that it is always happening. He further emphasized that the only reason they think altcoin is not there is that they do not know what went up. According to the BitMex executive, many crypto traders are looking out for an altcoin season that resembles the last one, as this gives them a sense of familiarity. He noted that most traders are tempted to buy what pumped last time, hoping that history repeats itself. Hayes uses Hyperliquid to prove point Hayes mentioned Hyperliquid (HYPE) as one of the best stories of this crypto cycle, noting that it launched at $2 or $3 before skyrocketing to $60. He also noted that Solana crashed in 2022 to about $7 before jumping periodically to reach nearly $300 early this year. “Again, there’s been altcoin season. You just didn’t participate in it.” – Arthur Hayes , Co-founder of BitMex However, not everyone agrees with Hayes’ views on altcoin season. Some traders with differing perspectives are still waiting for the traditional crypto market to unfold in the same way, starting with Bitcoin, before capital shifts to Ethereum, and later to other smaller altcoins. Meanwhile, CoinQuant CEO Maen Ftoui recently claimed that older altcoins with ETFs will dominate a significant portion of the capital deployed in the next altcoin season. Bitfinex analysts previously claimed that altcoins were unlikely to see a meaningful rally until ETFs start offering exposure beyond the largest crypto assets. However, Hayes still believes that asking when or how the next altcoin season will occur is the wrong question. He noted that new products are introduced all the time, and it is up to traders to use their own judgment to determine what is good and what is not. He further urges traders to adjust to the times, rather than being stuck in the past. Altcoin season index says it is not altcoin season yet Altcoin season index data retrieved from the blockchain data aggregator BlockchainCenter.Net shows a score of 35, indicating that it is not yet an altcoin season. A quick summary reveals that it has been approximately 85 days since the last altcoin season, and the longest streak without an altcoin season was 486 days. Meanwhile, the longest season lasted 117 days, while the average length of an altcoin season has been around 17 days. Meanwhile, several altcoins are trending today, including Chiliz (CHZ), which is trending on CoinGecko and CoinMarketCap. It is also a daily top winner based on trading volume, and it currently has a market cap of approximately $384 million. As of publication, CHZ is exchanging hands at $0.0378, representing a 1% rise in the past hour, a 25.4% increase in the past 24 hours, a 12.2% gain over the past seven days, and a 29.9% increase over the past 30 days.

A recent private report from financial research firm Fundstrat is sending ripples through the crypto community with a stark prediction: a significant Bitcoin correction could be on the horizon for early 2026. According to information obtained by Cointelegraph, the firm’s analysis suggests Bitcoin’s price may retreat to a range between $60,000 and $65,000 in the first half of that year. This forecast, while speculative, offers a crucial perspective for long-term investors navigating the volatile digital asset landscape. What Does the Fundstrat Report Say About the Bitcoin Correction? The analysis, reportedly authored by Sean Farrell, Fundstrat’s Head of Digital Asset Strategy, was not released through official public channels. Instead, it was distributed privately to select clients, adding an air of exclusivity to its insights. The core of the prediction hinges on a broader market recalibration. The report doesn’t just foresee a Bitcoin correction ; it extends the outlook to other major cryptocurrencies. Specifically, it projects Ethereum (ETH) could fall to between $1,800 and $2,000, while Solana (SOL) might see a decline to a range of $50 to $75. This coordinated forecast suggests analysts are anticipating a sector-wide pullback rather than an issue isolated to Bitcoin. The reasoning likely ties into macroeconomic cycles, potential regulatory developments, and the natural ebb and flow of investor sentiment after prolonged bull markets. Understanding this context is key for anyone with exposure to digital assets. Why Should Investors Pay Attention to This Prediction? While price predictions are inherently uncertain, reports from established firms like Fundstrat carry weight due to their methodological approach. They analyze trends, on-chain data, and macroeconomic indicators. Therefore, this warning of a Bitcoin correction serves as a valuable stress test for your portfolio strategy. It’s not necessarily a call to panic sell, but a prompt to review your risk tolerance and investment horizon. Consider these actionable insights based on such forecasts: Reassess Your Portfolio Allocation: Ensure your exposure to volatile assets like Bitcoin aligns with your long-term goals. Dollar-Cost Average (DCA): This strategy can mitigate timing risk if prices do decline. Secure Your Holdings: Use reputable, secure wallets for long-term storage, especially during turbulent periods. Diversify: Don’t put all your capital into a single asset or sector, even one as prominent as cryptocurrency. How Reliable Are Long-Term Crypto Price Forecasts? It’s crucial to maintain perspective. The crypto market is famously unpredictable, and forecasts looking nearly two years ahead involve significant speculation. Many variables can change the trajectory, including: Unexpected regulatory clarity or crackdowns Major technological breakthroughs (like Ethereum’s ongoing upgrades) Shifts in global monetary policy and inflation Institutional adoption rates surpassing expectations Therefore, treat this prediction of a Bitcoin correction as one informed scenario among many. It highlights a potential risk that prudent investors should acknowledge, not a guaranteed future. The value lies in preparing for volatility, not in attempting to time the market perfectly. Navigating Market Volatility with Confidence The ultimate takeaway from Fundstrat’s analysis is the enduring importance of a disciplined strategy. Whether a Bitcoin correction arrives in 2026 or not, markets will fluctuate. Successful investing is less about predicting every dip and peak and more about having a plan that withstands them. This involves clear goals, risk management, and a focus on the fundamental technology and adoption trends driving the asset class forward, rather than short-term price noise. In conclusion, the Fundstrat report provides a sobering, long-view checkpoint for the crypto market. A potential pullback to the $60K-$65K range for Bitcoin in H1 2026 is a plausible scenario based on historical cycles and growth patterns. However, it remains a prediction. By focusing on sound investment principles—education, security, diversification, and a long-term perspective—you can navigate such forecasts not with fear, but with prepared confidence. The journey of cryptocurrency investment is a marathon, not a sprint, and being ready for all terrains is what separates the resilient from the reactive. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: Is the Fundstrat Bitcoin correction report official? A1: The report was distributed privately to select clients and has not been released through Fundstrat’s official public channels. Its details were reported by crypto news outlets like Cointelegraph and Wu Blockchain. Q2: What is the predicted price for Ethereum and Solana? A2: The same report suggests Ethereum (ETH) could fall to $1,800-$2,000 and Solana (SOL) could drop to $50-$75 during the same projected correction period in H1 2026. Q3: Should I sell my Bitcoin based on this prediction? A3: This prediction is a long-term forecast and not financial advice. It should inform your risk assessment and strategy, not dictate panic selling. Consider your investment goals, timeline, and risk tolerance before making any decisions. Q4: How accurate are long-term crypto price predictions? A4: They are highly speculative. While based on analysis, the crypto market is influenced by countless unpredictable factors, making any forecast years in advance uncertain. They are best used for scenario planning, not as guarantees. Q5: What can I do to prepare for potential market volatility? A5: Key steps include diversifying your portfolio, practicing dollar-cost averaging, ensuring your assets are in secure storage, and avoiding investing more than you can afford to lose. Focus on a long-term strategy. Q6: Who is Sean Farrell? A6: Sean Farrell is the Head of Digital Asset Strategy at Fundstrat Global Advisors, the market research firm believed to have authored the private report containing these predictions.

Key Takeaways: Prosecutors say a Brooklyn man stole about $16M in crypto by posing as a Coinbase employee. The alleged scheme relied on social engineering, with funds laundered through mixers, swaps and crypto gambling sites. Authorities seized some assets, set bail at $500,000, and say efforts to recover more funds are ongoing. According to the Brooklyn District Attorney’s Office , Ronald Spektor posed as a Coinbase representative and contacted victims under the pretense that their digital assets were at immediate risk. Using that claim, Spektor allegedly pressured users into transferring cryptocurrency to wallets under his control. Alleged Crypto Scammer Used Panic Tactics to Target Victims Prosecutors said Spektor operated online under the alias “lolimfeelingevil” and relied on classic social engineering tactics rather than technical exploits. Victims were told their funds could be stolen by hackers unless they acted quickly, a strategy authorities say was used to bypass skepticism and trigger panic-driven decisions. Once the cryptocurrency was transferred, Spektor allegedly attempted to obscure the trail of funds by routing assets through cryptocurrency mixers, token-swapping services and crypto gambling platforms. Investigators said these steps were intended to complicate recovery efforts and hide the origin of the stolen funds. Spektor was arraigned Friday on 31 charges, including first-degree grand larceny, first-degree money laundering and participating in a scheme to defraud. The charges follow a year-long investigation by the Brooklyn District Attorney’s Office. As part of the probe, authorities seized approximately $105,000 in cash and about $400,000 in digital assets. Prosecutors said efforts are ongoing to recover additional funds believed to be tied to the alleged scheme. Investigators also pointed to Spektor’s online activity as evidence. Prosecutors said he “openly bragged about his heists” in a Telegram channel called “Blockchain enemies.” In recovered messages, Spektor allegedly claimed he lost $6 million in cryptocurrency through gambling, offering a rare glimpse into how the stolen funds may have been handled after the thefts. Spektor lives with his father in Sheepshead Bay, Brooklyn, prosecutors said. A judge set bail at $500,000, according to ABC7 New York, and denied a request to allow Spektor’s father to post bond, citing concerns over the source of the funds. One victim reportedly contacted the blockchain investigator ZachXBT, who published an investigation last year into the alleged scam. According to that report, the individual claimed to have lost $6 million. I am pleased to share that the threat actor ‘Ronald Spektor’ (Ron) was recently arrested in New York.

Coinbase said it reimbursed affected customers and strengthened internal controls following the incident. Spektor lives with his father in Sheepshead Bay, Brooklyn, prosecutors said. A judge set bail at $500,000, according to ABC7 New York, and denied a request to allow Spektor’s father to post bond, citing concerns over the source of the funds. Coinbase said it worked closely with the Brooklyn District Attorney’s Office and its Virtual Currency Unit throughout the investigation. In a blog post , the exchange said it helped identify both the suspect and victims, shared on-chain data linked to the alleged scheme and assisted authorities in tracing stolen assets.

He referenced recent CNBC coverage that examines why capital is moving away from Bitcoin and Ethereum exchange-traded funds and into XRP-linked products. The observation centers on a segment aired on CNBC’s Crypto World, where the network reviewed the outlook for crypto ETFs heading into 2026 and highlighted a clear divergence in recent fund flows. During the segment, the presenter noted that several spot crypto funds tied to Bitcoin and Ether have faced pressure in recent weeks. In contrast, ETFs tracking XRP were identified as attracting steady inflows, despite the general uncertainty across the digital asset market. CNBC is now covering why investors are rotating from BTC & ETH into $XRP . ETF inflows don’t lie. https://t.co/aEXZcWeTxC pic.twitter.com/X9qdjtJHIz — Xaif Crypto | (@Xaif_Crypto) December 18, 2025 ETF Inflows Signal Institutional Preferences Xaif Crypto’s commentary emphasizes that ETF inflows are not speculative indicators but recorded capital movements that reflect deliberate allocation decisions. In this context, the continued inflows into XRP-focused ETFs suggest that some investors are reassessing relative value and risk within the crypto sector. While Bitcoin and Ethereum remain dominant in market capitalization, recent ETF data suggest that institutional portfolios are becoming more selective. This shift appears to be occurring at a time when macroeconomic pressures and market volatility have weighed on flagship digital assets. As a result, XRP-linked products are increasingly being treated as a differentiated exposure rather than as part of a uniform crypto basket. Sustained Inflows Reinforce the Trend According to a Times Tabloid report published on the 17th, Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse referenced CoinDesk data showing strong performance among XRP spot ETFs since their launch. These products began trading on November 13, 2025 , and have since recorded 30 consecutive days of net inflows, a performance rarely seen in newly introduced crypto investment vehicles. Over this period, cumulative inflows were around $1 billion, while assets under management have risen to approximately $1.18 billion. The consistency of these inflows suggests sustained institutional participation rather than short-term positioning. This stands in contrast to Bitcoin and Ethereum spot ETFs, which have experienced periods of net outflows over the same timeframe. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 XRP Positioned as a Distinct Institutional Allocation The divergence in ETF flows indicates that institutions may be viewing XRP through a different lens, one more closely tied to utility-driven fundamentals and long-term use cases. Rather than tracking broader market sentiment, capital allocation into XRP ETFs appears to be guided by asset-specific considerations. As CNBC’s coverage and ETF data both illustrate, the current rotation is less about abandoning established digital assets and more about reallocating toward products showing resilience and consistency. For market observers, the sustained inflows into XRP-linked ETFs provide measurable evidence that institutional strategies within crypto are evolving.

According to data from Morningstar Direct, the top 10 UK funds in 2025 are all tied to gold, silver, or precious metal miners. Check out the list:- Franklin Gold and Precious Metals Fund delivered a return of 184.33%. SVS Baker Steel Gold and Precious Metals Fund came in with 173.47%. Schroder International Selection Fund Global Gold made 169.15%. Bakersteel Global Funds SICAV – Precious Metals Fund returned 168.51%. BlackRock Global Funds – World Gold Fund clocked 161.20%. CPR Invest – Global Gold Mines showed 158.69%. Jupiter Gold and Silver Fund earned 157.83%. Ninety One Global Strategy Fund – Global Gold Fund hit 157.53%. Ninety One Global Gold Fund pulled in 157.10%. Jupiter Gold and Silver Fund (another class) finished at 153.01%. Every name in the top 10 was betting on precious metals, and they were all right. Record-breaking gold prices fueled massive fund gains The surge came as gold jumped by 60% to over $4,300 per troy ounce. Silver crossed $60 an ounce in December. What lit the fire? Four things: geopolitical chaos, central banks shifting away from the dollar, persistent inflation, and a full-blown “fear of missing out” among investors. That combo turned metals into the year’s hottest trade. Laith Khalaf, head of investment analysis at AJ Bell, said, “The conditions which have created the gold rush don’t look like abating, and lower interest rates should be positive for the precious metal.” He also warned that gold can swing wildly, adding, “Buyers should beware there can be steep downdrafts and long periods in the wilderness.” Across Europe , the top 10 performing funds were also packed with precious metal strategies. Ken Lamont, principal at Morningstar, said Europe’s top funds were “overwhelmingly concentrated in precious metal-focused strategies.” Darius McDermott, managing director at FundCalibre, added, “Gold and precious metals have been leading the way in 2025 with some astonishing returns. There have also been very strong returns from most equity markets this year, too, and not just the US.” Daniel Casali, chief investment strategist at Evelyn Partners, pointed out that gold still serves a purpose in portfolios. “With Western public debt continuing to rise and gold’s proven role as an inflation hedge, holding bullion provides resilience amid geopolitical and financial uncertainty,” he said. Daniel backed that up with 2022 data, when stocks and bonds took a beating but gold held firm. Sadly, India-focused funds didn’t stand a chance, as Ken said that:- “Tariff [challenges] have weighed on growth expectations, while a tumbling rupee has pushed Indian equity returns into negative territory for UK investors this year.” He added that tech-heavy funds in India struggled as demand for outsourcing and IT services tanked, crushing profits. The Bank for International Settlements isn’t buying the hype. It flagged both gold and US stocks for flashing bubble signs, blaming “exuberance” among retail investors. “The past few quarters represent the only time in at least the last 50 years in which gold and equities have entered this territory simultaneously,” the BIS said. “Following its explosive phase, a bubble typically bursts with a sharp and swift correction.” Join Bybit now and claim a $50 bonus in minutes",News|BIS|EUR|GBP|Gold|INR|Silver|USD,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|FIAT|MARKET|MACROECONOMICS|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-12-20 08:50:12

The Blockchain Association led the coalition in a letter to Senate Banking Committee Chairman Tim Scott and Ranking Member Elizabeth Warren on Wednesday, arguing that attempts to reinterpret the law’s yield ban represent protectionism rather than consumer protection. “ The push to restrict stablecoin rewards beyond that agreed to in GENIUS is not a technical refinement or a consumer protection fix, ” the letter stated. “ It would prohibit the same types of incentive programs for stablecoin payments that banks have long offered on credit cards and other types of payment services. “ 1/ Today, we led a broad coalition of more than 125 industry leaders in a letter to Congress urging lawmakers to preserve the rights enumerated in the GENIUS Act that ensure the United States remains the most competitive and innovative capital market in the world. pic.twitter.com/nxZcNaJBTI — Blockchain Association (@BlockchainAssn) December 18, 2025 Banks Push Asymmetric Restrictions on Digital Payments The dispute centers on whether platforms like Coinbase and PayPal can offer rewards to stablecoin users through loyalty programs and third-party incentives. While the GENIUS Act explicitly prohibits stablecoin issuers from paying interest directly to holders, the coalition maintains that Congress deliberately preserved intermediaries’ ability to offer lawful rewards at the application layer. Banking groups led by the American Bankers Association have urged Treasury to interpret “ interest or yield ” broadly enough to capture any economic benefit, including merchant discounts and platform rewards. The coalition called this expansion “ overtly protectionist, ” noting that banks face no similar restrictions on credit card rewards despite engaging in riskier balance-sheet activities than GENIUS-regulated stablecoin issuers. “ With the federal funds rate at approximately 3.50–3.75%, average checking account yields remain near 0.07% and savings accounts around 0.40%, ” the letter noted. “ Stablecoin rewards programs enable platforms to share value directly with users, helping households benefit from higher-rate environments rather than absorbing losses to inflation. “ Source: TheBlockchainAssociation[dot]org Coalition Disputes Bank Deposit Flight Claims Banking associations have warned that stablecoin yields could trigger deposit outflows resembling the 1980s money market fund crisis, when withdrawals drained $32 billion from banks between 1981 and 1982. Treasury estimates suggested yield-bearing stablecoins could result in up to $6.6 trillion in deposit flight. The coalition firmly rejected these projections , citing Charles River Associates’ analysis, which found no evidence of disproportionate deposit outflows from community banks between 2019 and 2025. The letter questioned how banks can claim deposit constraints while holding roughly $2.9 trillion in reserve balances, earning interest at the Federal Reserve rather than deploying them into loans. “ Opposition to stablecoin rewards reflects protection of incumbent revenue models, not safety-and-soundness concerns, ” the coalition wrote, arguing that restricting third-party incentives would prevent stablecoins from competing on a level playing field with legacy payment systems. Citi executive warns stablecoin interest payments could drain bank deposits like the 1980s crisis amid GENIUS Act loophole concerns. #Stablecoin #Banks https://t.co/aaHxz9bXHM — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) August 25, 2025 Regulatory Certainty and Market Competition at Stake Beyond consumer choice, the coalition warned that reopening the yield issue before GENIUS implementation begins would undermine the regulatory certainty that defines Congressional frameworks. “ It would signal that even recently enacted compromises remain subject to almost immediate renegotiation, undermining the predictability that markets, consumers, and innovators rely on, ” the letter stated. The groups emphasized that rewards and incentives are standard competitive tools in markets with high network effects and switching costs, including the current payments market. Stablecoins offer faster settlement, lower transaction costs, and greater transparency compared to traditional rails, but adoption requires incentives to overcome entrenched user habits. The signatories include industry leaders such as Coinbase, PayPal, Stripe, Ripple, and Kraken, as well as Stand With Crypto chapters across 20 states and investment firms such as Andreessen Horowitz and Paradigm. “ Preserving the balance Congress struck is essential to protecting consumers, fostering competition, and ensuring that market structure legislation can advance on a bipartisan and durable basis, ” the coalition concluded, urging lawmakers to reject any effort to expand the yield prohibition beyond issuer payments. The dispute comes as stablecoin adoption accelerates, with a circulation of $310 billion.

Rep. Min Byoung-dug from the Democratic Party of Korea stressed the urgency of establishing a legal framework during the eighth Global Business Forum in Seoul. Min emphasized that stablecoins represent a critical element in maintaining control over domestic payment systems. The lawmaker warned that without swift action, Korea risks losing influence over its own financial infrastructure as dollar-denominated digital currencies gain traction globally. The Political Affairs Committee member argued that stablecoins have moved beyond theoretical debate. He stated that the focus must shift from questioning their necessity to implementing them effectively. Min characterized these digital assets as essential instruments for international payments, trade settlements, and remittance services. Dollar-Based Stablecoins Threaten Won's Dominance Min highlighted growing concerns about dollar-pegged stablecoins becoming standard tools in global commerce. He cautioned that failing to develop a won-backed alternative could result in significant erosion of Korea's monetary sovereignty. Dollar-linked stablecoins function as a new category of currency that nations must address strategically. The lawmaker noted several advantages these digital currencies offer. They enable faster transaction speeds compared to traditional banking systems. They also reduce costs associated with cross-border payments. These benefits make them increasingly attractive to businesses engaged in international trade. Min pointed to emerging market pressures forcing Korean companies to adapt. Many firms face demands to accept dollar-based stablecoins during overseas transactions. This trend continues regardless of domestic policy positions. Evidence suggests this shift has already begun affecting local businesses. Korean Businesses Already Using Foreign Stablecoins Small and medium-sized enterprises in Korea have started compensating foreign employees with dollar-denominated stablecoins. Workers increasingly request payment in these digital currencies. Several companies are exploring stablecoin options for international settlement purposes. Min warned these practices will become standard before proper regulatory frameworks emerge. Foreign stablecoin systems risk becoming deeply embedded in daily transactions.

John Normand, who runs investment strategy at the A$400bn AustralianSuper, said the fund is preparing to cut its exposure to public equities after watching valuations climb far beyond their historical lines. He also pointed to the sharp rise in leverage used to finance AI projects and the fast flow of fundraising through deals, venture rounds and public listings. Normand said the shift is coming because the AI cycle is reaching a late stage while the Federal Reserve is expected to start tightening in 2027, which he sees as a rough mix for stocks. He made these comments at a time when the Nasdaq Composite has climbed about 19 percent this year, following jumps of 43 percent and 29 percent in the last two years. Investors across the market have been whispering that the huge spending on AI may have pushed several tech names into levels that no one can call healthy. And Normand is not ignoring the numbers. Nvidia has doubled from its April low after President Donald Trump rolled out his “liberation day” tariff plan, and the stock is still up more than 30 percent for the year with a price-to-earnings ratio of 43. Alphabet has surged roughly 60 percent and trades around 30 times earnings. Watching the shift in global tech exposure Normand said the world’s major stock indices are now ruled by US names, especially Big Tech and AI names, with the Magnificent Seven alone making up around one-quarter of the MSCI World index. Inside AustralianSuper’s own book, international equities remain its biggest overweight position at 3 percentage points above its benchmark. But Normand said he has already started to adjust the fund’s overseas equity exposure since October by adding more listed infrastructure. He said he does not see AI stocks sitting in a bubble yet, but the risk is rising fast enough for him to take action now instead of waiting for a blow-up. Other large pension funds are moving in the same direction. Several schemes in the UK have started cutting their positions in US equities because they are uneasy about the market’s growing dependence on a small cluster of megacap tech names. Some funds are shifting to new regions, while others are adding ways to protect their portfolios from sudden drops. John Graham, the chief executive of Canada’s CPPIB, said he is “worried about the concentration risk” in US stocks and admitted that the C$777.5bn fund is “knowingly underweight” AI in its American allocation. Preparing for private equity and pricing risk in bonds Normand said he expects to increase AustralianSuper’s exposure to private equity going into 2026. He said higher interest rates in recent years slowed dealmaking, reduced the cash returned to investors and pushed many players to reduce commitments. He thinks 2026 could mark a turning point, saying, “I think next year will be the year where by the end of 2026 PE will deliver more than public equities and that’ll be a big change.” Private equity firms raised only $592bn in the 12 months to June, their weakest result in seven years. He also warned about what he sees as an “underlying vulnerability” in the bond market. Investors, he said, are pricing in only one quarter-point rate hike from the Fed in 2027, but past cycles show the central bank often raises rates by more than that after easing. Normand said that when the market adjusts, the most expensive assets will take the hardest hit. He said these pricey areas “tend to be centered around tech sector and AI theme – it doesn’t mean this is the end of the story, it just means we have to be mindful of the risks that we manage.” Get seen where it counts.

The focus of the post was not on price action or market sentiment, but on a structural upgrade to the XRP Ledger itself. At the center of this update is the publication of the first formal specification of the XRPL Payment Engine, the component responsible for executing XRP transfers and handling multi-asset payments across the network. Rather than introducing a new feature, the development formalizes what already exists. The payment engine has long been responsible for enforcing rules, validating paths, and ensuring transaction correctness. By formally specifying this engine, developers now document its behavior in a precise and verifiable manner, reducing ambiguity in how transactions are expected to function under all conditions. BOOOOOOOOOOOOOOM This is HUGE for $XRP . The core engine that moves XRP is now formally specified. The same verification standards used in banking & aerospace are coming to XRPL. pic.twitter.com/wez31BjIXp — Amonyx (@amonbuy) December 17, 2025 Bringing Formal Verification to the XRP Ledger According to the information highlighted by Amonyx, this specification work is being carried out in collaboration with Common Prefix, a firm known for its work in formal methods. Formal verification is a process widely used in sectors such as banking, aerospace, and safety-critical systems, where errors can have significant consequences. Applying this standard to the XRPL means the logic governing XRP payments can be mathematically verified for correctness, rather than relying solely on testing and code reviews. This shift has important implications for reliability and resilience. A formally specified payment engine allows developers and institutions to reason about edge cases, failure modes, and system guarantees with greater confidence. It also designed a reference point that can be used across different implementations, ensuring consistency as the ecosystem evolves. Implications for Long-Term Network Reliability The emphasis of the post was on long-term reliability rather than short-term adoption narratives. By strengthening the systems that move XRP , the ledger positions itself to meet the expectations of regulated and institutional environments. Financial infrastructure increasingly demands not only performance, but provable correctness, auditability, and predictability. This work also lowers barriers for external contributors. With a clear specification, developers can build tools, integrations, and enhancements without needing to infer behavior from source code. Over time, this can support a broader and more robust development ecosystem around the XRPL . We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Community Reaction and Broader Context Community responses reflected awareness of the scale of the development. One commenter, TafTrader, expressed surprise at how quickly XRP-related infrastructure is advancing and suggested that patience may be required before such progress is reflected in market pricing. While the comment touched on price expectations, the core sentiment aligned with the post’s focus on infrastructure depth rather than immediate valuation effects. Overall, the publication of a formal specification for the XRPL Payment Engine represents a foundational step. It underscores a strategic focus on correctness, reliability, and standards alignment, reinforcing XRP’s positioning as a network built for serious financial use cases rather than experimental deployment.

According to a report, the TOP eye specialist, Dr Solomon Guramatunhu, has urged the National Prosecuting Authority (NPA) to appeal against the acquittal of the two individuals he accused of defrauding him. According to previous reports, Dr Guramatunhu suffered a big crypto theft where more than $550,000 was stolen from his crypto wallet. The doctor fingered the two individuals, Lloyd and Melissa Chiyangwa, as the brains behind the theft , leading to a protracted lawsuit against the suspects. However, following the fresh ruling, Guramatunhu has now urged the NPA to follow up with an appeal of the acquittal of the suspects in the case. Zimbabwean eye doctor contests the court’s verdict in his case According to reports , the court, which was presided over by regional magistrate Marehwanazvo Gofa, acquitted the suspects based on a technicality. The magistrate mentioned that there was no evidence that digital assets constituted legal tender in Zimbabwe and, as such, there could be no basis for a fraud conviction. However, the Zimbabwean national has issued an update through his lawyer, Admire Rubaya. In his statement, the Zimbabwean international mentioned that the magistrate fundamentally erred in law and misdirected herself by equating the concept of property with legal tender. “The Regional Magistrates Court grossly erred and grossly misdirected itself in concluding that cryptocurrency tokens were not property capable of being stolen simply because cryptocurrency is not recognized in Zimbabwe as legal tender, as if property needs to be legal tender for it to be adjudged as capable of being stolen,” Rubaya wrote. Rubaya added that his client is of the firm belief that the High Court of Zimbabwe will arrive at a different decision. In his statement, Rubaya contends that digital assets are recognized as property under Zimbabwean law. He added that they fall into the category of incorporeal rights vested in a person and relate to movable property, which he says can be unlawfully taken. He also added that digital assets have tangible monetary value as they can be converted to money. Rubaya argues against the magistrate’s court’s verdict In view of his argument, Rubaya claimed that since the said digital assets can be converted into foreign currencies like the United States dollars, it is considered a view that money cannot be limited only to what is recognized as legal tender under the laws of Zimbabwe. “Money includes an entry in an account. There is no indication that the account being referred to in Section 112 of the Criminal Law Codification and Reform Act is only a normal bank account. Cryptocurrency tokens are kept as entries in a cryptocurrency account,” he added. Rubaya also urged the NPA to adopt a broader interpretation of the law, noting that control of a crypto account equates to control of the digital assets held within it. “When one has control of the cryptocurrency account, that person has control of the cryptocurrency tokens, which means the owner of the account has an incorporeal right vested in him or her, and that right is capable of being unlawfully and intentionally taken,” he argued. He also alleged that the Chiyangwas unlawfully transferred digital assets from Guramatunhu’s wallets to their own, thereby intentionally and unlawfully assuming ownership over assets belonging to the complainant. “The Chiyangwas connived to unlawfully and intentionally assume title in relation to Dr Guramatunhu’s incorporeal right to exercise title to the cryptocurrency tokens,” Rubaya stated. In the letter, Rubaya also promised to assist the NPA with research and legal material. “In light of the arguments raised herein, and with a view to ascertain whether there are prospects of success on appeal against the Chiyangwas’ acquittal, we have been instructed to assist you with research and legal material to allow you to appreciate the legal issues raised, so that the Chiyangwas can be held accountable for their alleged criminal misconduct,” Rubaya said. The case would likely test Zimbabwe’s legal interpretation of digital assets and whether they can be treated as property. Want your project in front of crypto’s top minds?

XRP alone accounts for $115.62 billion of that total, giving the token a market share of 30.39%, according to CoinGecko data. This means nearly one in every $3 invested in U.S.-linked crypto assets is concentrated in XRP, highlighting the asset’s outsized influence relative to its peers. Market data shows XRP trading at around $1.91, with a 24-hour trading volume of approximately $2.73 billion, placing it among the most actively traded assets in the broader crypto market. By comparison, other major made-in-USA cryptocurrencies trail by a wide margin in both valuation and liquidity. Solana ( SOL ) carries a market capitalization of roughly $70.85 billion, while USDC stands at about $77.11 billion. Meanwhile, Cardano’s ( ADA ) market cap sits near $13.67 billion, Chainlink’s ( LINK ) around $8.89 billion, Stellar’s ( XLM ) at approximately $7.13 billion, and Zcash’s ( ZEC ) close to $7.36 billion. Top made in USA cryptocurrencies. Source: CoinGecko Overall, while the made-in-USA category includes diverse projects ranging from smart contract platforms to payment networks and privacy coins, capital remains heavily concentrated in XRP. Why XRP is dominating XRP’s dominance is closely tied to the legal and regulatory clarity achieved in 2025. The resolution of the long-running case between Ripple Labs and the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission removed a major overhang that had constrained the asset for years. The conclusion of the case, including the dismissal of appeals and confirmation that XRP’s retail sales are not securities, provided regulatory certainty that few other large-cap cryptocurrencies can match. This clarity has reinforced XRP’s status as the most institutionally viable U.S.-linked crypto asset. Despite this legal victory, XRP’s price has remained below $2 after being weighed down by broader crypto market volatility. Analysts point to a mix of profit-taking following the legal resolution, macroeconomic pressure on risk assets, and the fact that much of the positive outcome had already been priced in well before the final rulings.

Supported by almost $20 million in received funds and an increasing number of over 18,530 supporters, MUTM could be a leading DeFi crypto of this season. At $0.035 and almost at the end of Phase 6 of presale, this token has exhibited incredible initial demand, which indicates that market players are optimistic about this DeFi crypto project focused on lending and borrowing with a revolutionary approach centered on interest-bearing assets and long-term yield generation. Unlike other cryptocurrencies that are solely reliant on market speculation, Mutuum Finance is attempting to establish itself with a defined usage scenario, measurable adoption, and a sound future vision, which are essential fundamental factors that distinguish a promising project on which massive long-term growth could be anticipated. As expectations escalate in anticipation of the testnet launch and improving fund outflow towards fundamentally justified DeFi-related projects, analysts are gradually emphasizing MUTM as the next crypto to hit $1 in price. MUTM Phase 6 Presale Approaching Full Subscription Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is currently in Presale Stage 6, which sees the price of its tokens at $0.035, an increase of 15% from the previous stage. This is followed by the upcoming Stage 7 that will increase the price of the tokens to $0.04, an increase of 20%. This is one of the final stages where the current price of the tokens is significantly lower compared to the final price. More than 18,530 people are already on board and have injected more than $19.5 million. The platform’s two-lending model and the approaching V1 Sepolia Testnet are of significant help to its early adopters, making MUTM a very practical DeFi crypto option. Mutuum Finance integrates the Peer-to-Contract (P2C) and Peer-to-Peer (P2P) lending mechanisms, allowing users to earn interest while retaining possession and control of their assets. The provision of a one-stop DeFi crypto platform that is safe, clear, and flexible makes MUTM a highly functional cryptocurrency for its users. USD-Pegged Stablecoin & Security Initiatives Mutuum Finance is soon going to unveil a fully collateralized stablecoin pegged to the USD on the Ethereum blockchain platform. The code of the platform has been audited and verified by CertiK to check its credibility and transparency. In addition to this, Mutuum Finance has launched a $50,000 USDT Bug Bounty Program together with CertiK, encouraging users to report bugs based on critical, major, minor, and low severity levels. As a way to encourage community interaction, Mutuum Finance is conducting a token $100,000 giveaway , whereby ten members will take home $10,000 worth of MUTM tokens. Mutuum Finance has a trust score of 95.0 out of 100 from CertiK, attesting to its robust security system. Given its innovative loan system and sound environment, MUTM appears to be on course to offer a progressive DeFi crypto experience, making it a potential candidate as the next crypto to hit $1. Hands-On Experience: Sepolia Testnet Lending & Borrowing Mutuum Finance is set to roll out Version 1 of the lending and borrowing solution on the Sepolia Testnet towards the end of 2025. Early adopters shall be able to access key assets like ETH and USDT with the help of liquidity pools, mtTokens, debt tokens, and an auto liquidator bot. This test network shall give real-life exposure with a firsthand look at the functionality of the platform and cement the importance of MUTM as a DeFi crypto investment opportunity. The presale is currently in Phase 6, priced at $0.035, where it has received contributions from more than 18,530 investors worth close to $20 million. The next presale, Phase 7, sees the price increase to $0.04, and as such, it is one of the last chances investors get to buy at a discount prior to V1 Sepolia Testnet. MUTM has a two-loan protocol, a pegged USD stablecoin yet to be launched, and a $100,000 free tokens giveaway, among other attributes that make it a functional, secure, and community-oriented DeFi crypto. Early birds are already reserving their spots prior to what is projected as the project that could be the next crypto to hit $1.

This latest development hints at potential opportunities for savvy investors. Get ready to explore which digital currencies might be gearing up for significant gains in the near future. Sui (SUI) Faces Struggle But Shows Signs of Potential Growth Source: tradingview Sui (SUI) is currently priced between $1.47 and $1.68. It's close to its nearest resistance of $1.81, hinting at a potential small rise. The past week saw a drop of about eleven percent, and it's down around fourteen percent this month. Over the past six months, it has tumbled over forty-four percent. With a Relative Strength Index of nearly 63 and its Stochastic nearing 85, it suggests an overbought position. A nearby support at $1.39 might hold if prices dip. If upward trends gain support, Sui could aim for its second resistance at $2.02, marking an increase of about Twenty Percent from its current peak. Conclusion This development could ignite interest in altcoins. With Bitwise stepping in, SUI could see increased attention. Coinbase is already a known player, and this move diversifies their offering. Competition among altcoin ETFs is likely to heat up, potentially leading to new opportunities for investors.

This development promises to bridge cutting-edge technology with traditional banking. The article will explore how this could influence the crypto landscape and identify potential growth coins poised to benefit from this synergy. Chainlink Eyes $15 Barrier Amid Mixed Market Signals Source: tradingview Chainlink's price is currently bouncing between $12.60 and $14.48. The next price ceiling stands at $15.68, offering a potential rise of around 10% from its current range. If it crosses this, the second target is $17.56, marking further possible gains. On the downside, support levels are at $11.91 and then $10.03 if things get tough. Over the past week, LINK dropped by over 11%, but the past six months show a small gain of just above 3%. Despite a slight dip in recent months, market indicators like the RSI and Stochastic Oscillator suggest there's upward energy in LINK, but breaking the $15 mark will be crucial for further growth. Conclusion The new platform integrates AI technology and major financial institutions. This move could enhance the utility and adoption of LINK tokens. By fostering real-world applications, the platform aims to bridge the gap between traditional finance and blockchain technology. It suggests a promising future for Chainlink, potentially benefiting LINK holders and attracting more institutional partnerships. Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

The acquisition recognizes CryptoPunks as an essential component of digital and cultural history. According to CryptoPunks, the eight NFTs included Punk 4018, Punk 2786, Punk 5616, Punk 5160, Punk 3407, Punk 7178, Punk 74, and Punk 7899.

The collective… pic.twitter.com/hswHYVML2R — CryptoPunks (@cryptopunks) December 19, 2025 CryptoPunks said that this gift’s collective generosity demonstrates the tenacity and spirit of the punk community, which has sustained the project. The team confirmed that Mara Calderon and ArtOnBlockchain made this historic donation possible. CozomoMedici, JudithESSS, NTmoney, kukulabanze, and Rhyd0n also contributed Punks from their own collection as part of their ongoing dedication to the project. According to CryptoPunks, 1OF1_art assisted in the acquisition of the NFTs. CryptoPunks are pixelated avatars that are randomly created by computer code recorded on the Ethereum blockchain. Matt Hall and John Watkinson introduced the CryptoPunks in 2017. The two creators are also collectively known as Larva Labs. CryptoPunks revealed that there are only 10,000 punks, and no two are the same. Currently, the 10,000 CryptoPunks are dispersed throughout the Ethereum wallets of 3,121 individuals. CryptoPunk has progressed to dominate the NFT market . At a Christie’s auction in 2021, one of the most sought-after CryptoPunk NFTs, CryptoPunk 9997, sold for HK$33.9 million (approximately US$4.35 million), nearly five times its highest estimate. The NFT, which was initially purchased in 2017 for 0.15 Ethereum (then $66), is one of only 88 zombie CryptoPunks in the world. Only 273 and 254 punks, respectively, have a tiny beard and a cap. CryptoPunks market activity remains stable, indicating ongoing interest in the collection’s most affordable assets, with the current floor price at 26.58 ETH (approximately $79.37). The project has made 1,888 sales in the last 12 months. The project’s lifetime sales volume has reached 1.40 million ETH, equivalent to approximately $3.89 billion, underscoring its enduring significance in the NFT market. According to CryptoPunks, the trade momentum remains strong in the short term, despite larger market cycles, with sales of 136.48 ETH ($407,540) over the last day, 505.91 ETH ($1,510,000) over the previous week, and 2,850 ETH ($8,500,000) over the last four weeks. Market trends of NFTs transform the world of art NFTs have become increasingly popular in the art market. In July, the Institute of Contemporary Art, Miami (ICA Miami) purchased CryptoPunk 5293, one of just 3,840 female punks. After being purchased, CryptoPunk 5293 became the first NFT to be included in a major art museum collection. On February 25, 2021, Christie’s posted an NFT-based digital artwork by artist Beeple, commonly known by his actual name, Mike Winkelmann, for online auction. The opening price for the NFT was $100, with no estimate provided. According to Christie’s, Beeple sold for an outstanding price of $69.3 million. The NFT became the third most expensive living artist at auction (after Jeff Koons and David Hockney). Beeple set a record for the most costly digital artwork. According to the 2025 Art Basel and UBS Art Market Report, the global art market may be recalibrating , but it’s not collapsing, despite growing economic and geopolitical unrest. The report claimed that the industry is expanding its base at the lower and mid-price tiers, attracting a new breed of collectors, despite overall numbers indicating a period of adjustment. The report revealed a 3 percent increase in transaction volume, reaching 40.5 million. According to the report, the increase in transactions reflected continued market participation despite the presence of headwinds. However, the report noted that sales across tracked geographies continued to face limitations in 2024 due to political tensions, economic volatility, and trade fragmentation. The report noted that the limitations resulted in a 12 percent decrease compared to the previous year, amounting to $57.5 billion. Don’t just read crypto news. Understand it.

Momentum indicators for XMR point higher, with traders targeting $445 and a Fibonacci extension near $479. ZCash rebounded sharply from $384, reclaiming the $400–$402 support zone in a V-shaped recovery. While much of the crypto market remains constrained by weak sentiment and macro uncertainty, privacy-focused tokens have shown relative strength. Monero and ZCash are attracting renewed interest as traders rotate into assets displaying clearer technical setups and improving momentum. Both tokens are holding above key support zones, prompting expectations of further upside if current levels continue to attract buyers. Behind every emerging crypto trend lies not only data and trading activity but also the way narratives shape market perception. Outset PR has built a reputation for aligning brand storytelling with these cycles, helping blockchain and Web3 projects establish visibility at moments of strategic inflection. Monero Breaks Long-Term Resistance Monero has reclaimed the $420 level, a critical resistance zone that has capped price action repeatedly since 2017. The breakout marks a notable shift in structure and has drawn in technically driven buyers. Momentum indicators support the move. The MACD has printed a bullish crossover, with the MACD line at 8.85 moving above the signal line at 7.76. The 14-day RSI stands at 55.9, indicating neutral-to-bullish conditions rather than an overextended market. The 7-day simple moving average, near $414.33, has now turned into support, reinforcing the strength of the breakout. Upside Targets Draw Trader Interest With $420 reclaimed, technical traders are targeting the $445.22 swing high as the next near-term objective. Beyond that, Fibonacci extension levels point to a potential move toward $479.29 if momentum remains intact. Sustained daily closes above $420 could act as a catalyst for additional inflows, particularly from swing traders who tend to chase confirmed breakouts. Such a move would likely increase short-term volatility as positioning builds. ZCash Reclaims $400 After Sharp Rebound ZCash has staged a strong recovery, rebounding from $384 to around $409.56 in a V-shaped move. The rally allowed ZEC to reclaim the $400–$402 zone, an area that now serves as short-term support. Market data suggest mid-sized traders accumulated aggressively during the dip, helping stabilize prices and reverse the downtrend. The speed of the recovery highlights improving confidence among active participants. Momentum Improves, Resistance Remains ZCash momentum indicators have turned constructive. The MACD histogram has flipped positive at +1.03 for the first time in weeks, signaling a shift toward bullish momentum. On the upside, the 38.2% Fibonacci retracement near $557.41 remains the key resistance level. In the near term, short-term traders are focusing on the $420–$430 range as a liquidity target, where profit-taking and increased activity are likely. How Outset PR Optimizes PR Budgets and Delivers Tangible Results The purpose of any PR campaign is to boost brand visibility. Traditionally, this has meant securing as many publications as possible, often with unpredictable outcomes. It was difficult to know how many readers would actually see a story, leaving much of PR to guesswork. Actually, it had been guesswork until analysts of Outset PR developed Syndication Map —a proprietary tool that identifies which outlets attract the most traffic and where a story is likely to achieve the strongest syndication lift. Senior Media Analyst Maximilian Fondé explains: If a company needs a top list article, we filter the table for media that publish this format, cross-check costs and placement conditions, and know within minutes which outlets to pitch. Over time, that builds into a comprehensive database of crypto-friendly publishers – something other players in the industry don't have right now. Smarter Campaigns, Lower Costs Campaigns built with Syndication Map are not about mass reach for its own sake. They are carefully crafted to serve specific goals. By narrowing the focus to the most effective outlets, Outset PR reduces unnecessary spending on low-impact publications. Another key factor is communication. Outset PR’s dedicated Media Relations team, led by Anastasia Anisimova , has earned the trust of leading outlets through professionalism and genuine relationships. Sincerity and friendliness are our core principles, earning us the trust of numerous media outlets. Unfortunately, not all agencies in our industry prioritize friendliness in their communications. Extended Reach Through Syndication Outset PR campaigns also achieve more visibility than clients initially pay for. Articles are frequently republished across aggregators and platforms such as CoinMarketCap and Binance Square, extending exposure far beyond the original placement. Well-placed articles can achieve up to ten times the outreach of the original post. The case of StealthEX demonstrates this effect clearly: targeted tier-1 pitching led to 92 republications across outlets including CoinMarketCap, Binance Square, and Yahoo Finance, generating a total outreach of over 3 billion. Outset PR Sets a New Standard Pitching to a major outlet still has value, but syndication often delivers far greater reach at a lower cost. Outset PR has mastered this strategy, combining proprietary tools, strong media relations, and syndication opportunities to deliver results backed by numbers. Outlook: Strength Builds Above Support Monero and ZCash are showing signs of accumulation and improving momentum at a time when many large-cap cryptocurrencies remain range-bound. As long as XMR holds above $420 and ZEC maintains support above $400, the technical bias favors further upside rather than a return to recent lows. A broader breakout will still depend on follow-through buying and market conditions, but for now, privacy coins are among the few segments displaying constructive price action.

56083174,https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2025/12/top-7-blockchain-web3-pr-agencies-in-2026,1766223977,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/75/56083174.jpeg,Top 7 Blockchain & Web3 PR Agencies in 2026,https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2025/12/top-7-blockchain-web3-pr-agencies-in-2026,"The role of public relations in crypto has fundamentally changed. In earlier cycles, visibility often meant securing a handful of headlines during a token launch or funding round. In 2026, that approach is no longer enough. Web3 companies are competing not only for media attention, but for algorithmic credibility — across search engines, AI assistants, aggregators, and large language models. As AI-driven discovery reshapes how information is surfaced, the best blockchain PR agencies are evolving into visibility architects: designing narratives that travel across media ecosystems, persist over time, and are recognized by both human readers and machines. Key Trends Shaping Crypto & Web3 PR in 2026 1. AI Search Optimization (LLMO) Replaces SEOVisibility now depends on whether brands appear in AI-generated answers on tools like ChatGPT and Perplexity. PR-driven authority and third-party validation determine AI citations. 2. On-Chain Data Becomes a Story EngineWallet activity, DAO votes, and usage spikes are increasingly turned into press-ready narratives that signal real traction. 3. Community Credibility Beats Paid Coverage Organic engagement , founder voices, and micro-KOLs carry more trust — for audiences and AI systems alike — than sponsored placements. 4. Cross-Industry Narratives Win AttentionStories connecting crypto with AI, gaming, and culture outperform siloed blockchain messaging. 5. Distribution Strategy Matters More Than VolumeHow stories spread across aggregators, republications, and secondary outlets now outweighs raw placement counts. Below are seven blockchain and Web3 PR agencies that stand out in 2026 — starting with the one that most clearly represents this new generation of crypto communications. 1. Outset PR : Engineering Visibility for the AI Era Outset PR has positioned itself at the forefront of modern crypto PR by moving beyond traditional media outreach into data-driven visibility engineering. Rather than treating press placements as isolated wins, the agency focuses on how information propagates — and how brands become discoverable long after publication. What they’re known for: data-driven crypto PR built for compounding reach + AI-era discoverability. Methods & strategies: Syndication Map : an analytical tool that maps how coverage spreads across crypto media ecosystems, focusing on outlets with high secondary pickup potential. LLM visibility / “topical authority” engineering: targeted “LLM seeding,” structured facts, and semantic clarity so AI systems can reuse and cite the brand. AIO (AI Interaction Optimization) : optimizes what happens after AI sends traffic—high-signal pages, clear navigation, and content density that converts AI-referred users. Their published case studies highlight campaigns such as: StealthEX: 26+ tier-1 mentions and billions of estimated impressions. ChangeNOW: 40% growth in customer base via targeted PR and media exposure. Brand reputation campaigns that generated stronger online review ratings. Why they stand out : They treat PR like distribution science—forecasting spread before launch, then optimizing for both humans and AI discovery layers. 2. Coinbound : Crypto-Native Scale and Distribution Coinbound remains one of the most recognizable names in crypto PR, largely due to its deep roots in the Web3 ecosystem. The agency blends media relations with influencer marketing, social amplification, and community growth — offering clients an all-in-one distribution engine. Rather than focusing solely on editorial authority, Coinbound excels at reach and momentum, making it a strong choice for projects that need rapid awareness across multiple channels. What they’re known for: crypto-native PR + marketing with a strong distribution engine and a large ecosystem footprint. Case study: MetaMask: Ongoing PR and influencer amplification to maintain wallet category leadership. Cosmos: Media and community campaigns reinforcing the modular blockchain narrative. Why they stand out: A blended model: PR + creator/influencer amplification + full-funnel marketing support, useful for tokens/apps that need both headlines and community momentum. 3. MarketAcross : Enterprise-Grade Blockchain Communications MarketAcross has built a reputation as the agency of choice for large blockchain protocols and infrastructure companies. Its strength lies in strategic storytelling at an institutional level, combining PR, content marketing, and SEO into cohesive campaigns. What they’re known for: enterprise-grade blockchain PR and thought leadership, with robust content + SEO integration. Case study: Their case studies highlight campaigns like Space and Time’s Microsoft-backed debut with multi-channel visibility (press/Reddit/YouTube) and large reported readership numbers. Why they stand out: Strong at big-brand credibility + long-form narrative building, especially when you need coordinated comms, content, and search discovery working together. 4. Wachsman : Institutional Trust and Strategic Communications Wachsman is one of the longest-standing communications firms in the crypto space, with experience spanning exchanges, foundations, and protocol-level projects. Its approach reflects traditional strategic communications, adapted to blockchain’s complexities. Rather than chasing volume, Wachsman focuses on message discipline, stakeholder trust, and issues management. What they’re known for: strategic communications with a long track record in crypto/finance, often aligned with institutional positioning and issues management. Case study: Publicly highlighted client categories include major protocols and exchanges (e.g., Cosmos, IOHK/Cardano, Hedera; Bitfinex, eToro), showing breadth across the sector. Why they stand out: “Old-school PR precision” adapted to Web3: strong for regulated narratives, complex messaging, and stakeholders beyond crypto-native media. 5. ReBlonde : Bridging Crypto and Mainstream Tech Media ReBlonde approaches blockchain PR from a broader tech communications perspective. With experience across SaaS, AI, and emerging technologies, the agency helps crypto companies translate complex concepts for mainstream business and technology outlets. Its campaigns often prioritize interviews, bylined articles, and founder narratives designed to appeal to non-crypto audiences. For Web3 startups seeking legitimacy outside the crypto bubble, ReBlonde provides a bridge between decentralized innovation and traditional media expectations. What they’re known for: global tech PR with a dedicated crypto/blockchain practice and a traditional media relations backbone. Case study: Polygon: PR and thought leadership support for a leading Web3 infrastructure network across global tech media. eToro: Media relations support around crypto and fintech narratives for mainstream audiences. Why they stand out: Strong for teams that want mainstream credibility (not just crypto press) and a steady cadence of thought leadership, interviews, and narrative building. 6. High Vibe PR : Boutique PR with AI Search Focus High Vibe PR represents a newer wave of boutique agencies that explicitly optimize for AI-driven discovery. The firm emphasizes LLM visibility — ensuring that brands are not only covered by media, but surfaced in AI-generated answers and category-level queries. What they’re known for: boutique Web3/gaming/AI PR with explicit emphasis on AI search visibility (LLMO). Case study: A campaign for GOAT Gaming produced 80+ tier-one placements, 18+ interviews, and AI citations under category-style queries. Why they stand out: Clear positioning around AI-optimized PR (being discoverable in AI answers), which is increasingly a differentiator in 2025. 7. Cryptic : Full-Stack Web3 Marketing and PR Cryptic takes a more holistic approach, combining PR with growth marketing, partnerships, and community support. While media relations are part of the offering, they are often integrated into broader go-to-market strategies. What they’re known for: Web3 marketing solutions that include comms, growth, and partnerships—often positioned as a full-stack support layer. Case study: Client feedback suggests Cryptic is particularly effective for early-stage projects that need execution across multiple fronts, rather than pure brand positioning. Why they stand out: Practical execution across content + community + partnerships, which can matter more than pure media relations for earlier-stage projects. FAQ Which agency is best if we care most about AI visibility in 2026? Outset PR and High Vibe PR are the most explicitly aligned with AI-era discoverability approaches (LLM visibility/AIO/LLMO). Do I need a crypto-native PR agency, or can a traditional PR firm do it? Crypto-native agencies usually understand token cycles, exchange/listing narratives, and crypto press mechanics; traditional firms may excel at mainstream positioning but can miss crypto distribution dynamics. What should I ask before hiring a blockchain PR agency? Ask for: (1) measurable outcomes tied to goals, (2) examples of second-wave pickup/syndication, (3) AI visibility plan (LLMO/AIO), (4) crisis readiness, and (5) clear reporting cadence. How long does crypto PR take to work? Launch coverage can happen quickly, but authority-building (and AI visibility compounding) is typically a multi-month effort, especially if you want consistent citations and sustained narrative presence. Final Thoughts The defining shift in crypto PR in 2025 is clear: visibility is no longer just about coverage — it’s about persistence and machine recognition. Agencies like Outset PR, which engineer how narratives spread and how brands are interpreted by AI systems, reflect where the industry is heading. For Web3 companies choosing a PR partner today, the key question is no longer “Who can get us press?” but rather: Who can make our story last — and be found — in an AI-mediated world?

Key Takeaways: Senator Cynthia Lummis will not seek reelection in 2026 and will leave the Senate in January 2027. Lummis emerged as one of Congress’s most influential pro-Bitcoin lawmakers and backed Trump’s crypto agenda. Her exit raises uncertainty over the future of US crypto market structure legislation. In a post shared Friday on X , Lummis said the decision followed months of reflection during what she described as physically and mentally demanding legislative sessions. “Deciding not to run for reelection does represent a change of heart for me,” she wrote, adding that she no longer feels able to commit to another six-year term. “I am a devout legislator, but I feel like a sprinter in a marathon. The energy required doesn’t match up.” Cynthia Lummis Emerged as Congress’s Leading Pro-Bitcoin Voice First elected in 2020 and sworn in the following January, Lummis quickly emerged as one of Capitol Hill’s most recognizable champions of Bitcoin and blockchain technology. She frequently framed digital assets as a strategic priority for the United States and aligned closely with President Donald Trump’s pro-crypto messaging during his current term. Lummis has played a central role in pushing forward the long-debated digital asset market structure bill, which aims to clarify regulatory oversight for cryptocurrencies and related products. The legislation passed the House of Representatives in July and has since been reviewed by both the Senate Banking Committee and the Senate Agriculture Committee, where Lummis holds seats. Thank you, Wyoming! Serving our state has been the honor of my life. – Cynthia Lummis pic.twitter.com/FoRTlHaHxI — Cynthia Lummis (@CynthiaMLummis) December 19, 2025 Despite months of discussion, the bill was not brought to a full Senate vote before lawmakers adjourned for the holidays. Her pending exit adds uncertainty to the bill’s future. With Lummis stepping away, it remains unclear who will assume leadership on crypto policy within the Senate Republican caucus. Lummis Exit Comes Ahead of High-Stakes 2026 US Midterm Elections The timing is also politically sensitive. In 2026, all 435 seats in the House and 33 Senate seats will be contested, raising the possibility of a shift in congressional control . President Trump’s term is scheduled to conclude in January 2029. Concerns about delays have already surfaced. North Carolina Senator Thom Tillis warned in October that pushing a Senate vote on the market structure bill into 2026 could complicate progress, as lawmakers turn their focus to midterm campaigns. Crypto advocacy groups are watching closely. Stand With Crypto, an organization focused on mobilizing digital asset voters, has suggested that lawmakers’ positions on the bill could influence voter behavior in the upcoming election cycle. While the House passed its Digital Asset Market Clarity Act in July with bipartisan support , giving the CFTC primary oversight of digital commodities, the Senate has been developing its own framework, using different terminology, such as “ancillary assets,” to define non-security tokens.

At the same time, the number of crypto bookmakers keeps growing — and not all of them are equally reliable. In 2026, choosing a licensed crypto betting site is less about chasing the biggest bonus and more about understanding regulation, transparency, and platform structure. This guide breaks down the key factors bettors should evaluate before placing bets with cryptocurrency. How Does Crypto Sports Betting Work? Crypto sports betting platforms allow users to place wagers using digital assets such as Bitcoin, Ethereum, or stablecoins like USDT. Instead of relying on banks or card processors, transactions are handled on-chain, often resulting in faster deposits and withdrawals. Unlike traditional bookmakers, many crypto sportsbooks operate globally and support wallet-based access, making them attractive for users seeking speed and flexibility. Is Crypto Betting Legal in 2026? The legality of crypto betting varies by jurisdiction. In many regions, online sports betting is regulated, but crypto payments may fall into a legal gray area. Licensed crypto betting platforms typically operate under international gambling licenses and serve users across multiple regions. While this does not automatically guarantee legality in every country, licensing provides a baseline level of accountability, consumer protection, and dispute handling. How to Choose a Licensed Crypto Betting Site 1. Check Licensing and Regulatory Status Licensing remains the most important trust signal in crypto betting. A licensed crypto sportsbook should clearly display: The issuing authority Jurisdiction of operation Public terms and conditions Licensed platforms tend to follow defined operational standards and are less likely to disappear overnight. 2. Evaluate Platform Security Security goes beyond simple encryption. Look for sportsbooks that demonstrate: Secure wallet infrastructure Transparent custody of funds Audits or verifiable systems Some modern Web3 sportsbooks publish live betting data or on-chain settlement records, allowing users to independently verify outcomes — a strong signal of operational maturity. 3. Understand Bonus Structures and Terms Bonuses can add value, but only when their conditions are clear. Always review: Wagering requirements Eligible markets Withdrawal restrictions In 2026, many reputable crypto sportsbooks focus more on cashback, free bets, and ongoing rewards rather than overly aggressive welcome offers. 4. Review Deposit and Withdrawal Policies Fast withdrawals are one of the main reasons bettors choose crypto bookmakers. Before depositing, check: Supported cryptocurrencies Average withdrawal times Network fees and limits A quality crypto sportsbook should offer predictable payouts without unnecessary delays or hidden conditions. 5. Assess Product Quality and Betting Experience Crypto bettors value speed and efficiency. Strong platforms usually provide: Stable live betting markets Competitive odds Responsive interfaces across desktop and mobile Live betting performance is often a good indicator of overall platform quality. 6. Research Reputation and User Feedback Even licensed platforms can differ in execution. Reading user feedback helps identify: Withdrawal reliability Support responsiveness Long-term platform stability Consistent complaints around frozen withdrawals or unclear rules are red flags. Benefits of Using Crypto for Sports Betting More Privacy Crypto betting sites typically require less personal information than traditional bookmakers. Faster Transactions and Lower Fees Blockchain transactions often settle faster than bank transfers, especially for withdrawals. More Transparency Some platforms publish betting data or use provably fair mechanisms, increasing trust. Greater Access Crypto sportsbooks are often available globally, offering access to markets not always covered by local operators. Security and Risks in Crypto Sports Betting Beware of Unlicensed Platforms Unlicensed sportsbooks carry higher risk, especially regarding fund safety and dispute resolution. How to Identify Secure Platforms Look for licensing, transparent policies, and technical audits where available. Challenges of Crypto Betting Market volatility, regulatory uncertainty, and platform quality vary widely. Responsible Gambling Crypto betting should follow the same responsible gambling principles as traditional betting, including bankroll management and self-limits. A Practical Example of Modern Crypto Betting Platforms Some newer crypto sportsbooks illustrate how licensing, transparency, and Web3 infrastructure can coexist. Platforms like Dexsport , for example, combine licensed operations with wallet-based access, multi-chain crypto support, and publicly visible betting data — showing how crypto betting is moving toward more structured and transparent models without sacrificing speed or privacy. Conclusion Choosing a licensed crypto betting site in 2026 requires more than just finding a platform that accepts cryptocurrency. Licensing, security practices, payout reliability, and transparency are what separate long-term operators from short-lived sites. By focusing on regulation, clear policies, and platform design, bettors can significantly reduce risk while benefiting from the advantages that crypto sports betting offers.",More News,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|MARKET|REGULATION|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Crypto Daily', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/75/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptodaily,2025-12-20 09:57:11
56083673,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=868655,1766224808,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/21/56083673.jpeg,Here’s Why The XRP Price Keeps Crashing,https://www.newsbtc.com/analysis/xrp/why-xrp-price-keeps-crashing/,"On-chain analytics platform CryptoQuant has revealed why the XRP price keeps crashing, recently dropping below the psychological $2 level. The platform noted that the XRP ETF approval has failed to stop the selling pressure but instead looks to have escalated it. Why The XRP Price Is Crashing Despite ETF Success In a CryptoQuant report, analyst PelinayPA revealed that the XRP price is facing significant selling pressure from whales holding between $100,000 and 1m XRP and those holding above 1m. These XRP whales are said to account for the majority of inflows into the crypto exchange Binance. Related Reading: Peter Brandt Highlights Bearish XRP Price Chart, ‘You Need To Deal With It’ These transfers indicate that these whales are typically looking to offload these coins, which is putting selling pressure on the XRP price. PelinayPA noted that after each major inflow spike on the chart, the XRP price forms a lower high and lower low structure, suggesting that supply is overwhelming demand at the moment. The CryptoQuant report noted that this happens because there is no strong new spot buyer in the market. The continuous increase in available supply is also said to keep pushing the XRP lower, even though the whales are not aggressively dumping. Meanwhile, PelinayPA highlighted key price levels to watch out for as the price continues to crash. The analyst stated that, based on the inflow intensity and price reactions, the first major support zone stands between $1.82 and $1.87. She noted that this range marked where the price briefly stabilized and where small buyers appeared. However, XRP still risks crashing to the $1.50 and $1.66 range if the large outflows continue. The chart does not indicate that the altcoin could rally anytime soon with this selling pressure. Whales Took Advantage Of The ETF Narrative The CryptoQuant report stated that, in theory, the XRP ETF process was expected to create institutional demand and push the price higher through spot buying. However, that hasn’t been the case, as there have instead been high-volume XRP inflows to Binance. PelinayPA explained that whales were the first to act as ETF approval expectations increased. Related Reading: XRP Hasn’t Entered A Bear Market Yet; Analyst Shares Why The analyst further revealed that XRP accumulated in advance for the ETF narrative was transferred to exchanges and used as sell-side liquidity. Basically, whales sold the ETF approval story to retail investors. As a result, the XRP price faces significant selling pressure every time it approaches the $1.95 level. PelinayPA reiterated that expecting a bullish move before exchange inflows decline would be an unrealistic assumption. However, it is worth noting that the XRP ETFs have been successful so far, accumulating over $1 billion in net assets in just over a month since their launch. At the time of writing, the XRP price is trading at around $1.90, up almost 4% in the last 24 hours, according to data from CoinMarketCap.

Meme tokens that once dominated attention are slowing down, while a new DeFi altcoin priced at $0.035 is gaining traction as traders prepare for the next crypto cycle. Many are now comparing Pepecoin (PEPE) to Mutuum Finance (MUTM) to see which one holds the stronger runway into 2026. Pepecoin (PEPE) Pepecoin (PEPE) delivered one of the fastest meme coin surges of its cycle. It climbed from near-zero levels to a multi-billion-dollar valuation as viral posts and heavy speculation pushed it into major exchange listings. The token became a centerpiece of meme-driven trading. Early buyers saw large returns, and PEPE briefly captured the same excitement once held by Dogecoin and Shiba Inu. But the environment has changed. PEPE now carries a large market cap that limits its ability to rally further. Large caps move slowly because they require heavy inflow to climb. Analysts also point to PEPE’s lack of internal utility as a barrier to long-term growth. Without a clear economic model or revenue engine, the token depends on sentiment cycles. When hype cools, movement slows. Several forecasts show mild growth for PEPE and place its upside far lower than early expectations. This is why many traders who once supported the token are now looking toward smaller and more structured new crypto projects. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is developing a decentralized lending protocol designed around on-chain activity and sustainable yield. It uses a dual lending structure where users can lend assets such as ETH or USDT and receive mtTokens. These mtTokens increase in value as borrowers repay interest. For example, if a user lends $500 of ETH, their mtTokens will grow as borrowing activity increases. This creates a yield system that depends on real usage rather than sentiment. Borrowers interact with interest rates that shift according to liquidity. When liquidity is high, borrowing remains cheaper. When liquidity tightens, borrowing costs rise. Loan-to-value rules support safe borrowing and reduce liquidation risk. If collateral drops too far, liquidators repay part of the debt and receive discounted collateral. This structure creates long-term efficiency and stability inside the protocol. Mutuum Finance confirmed through its official X account that the V1 testnet will launch in Q4 2025. It will include the lending pool, mtTokens, the debt-tracking module and the liquidation system. ETH and USDT will be supported at launch. Halborn Security is reviewing the contract suite to ensure performance and safety before the testnet goes live. These updates have helped pull more attention from traders following top crypto opportunities under $0.05. Presale Progress and Community Activity Mutuum Finance has already shown early traction. It has raised $19.4M and has more than 18,600 holders. The token sale started at $0.01 and now sits at $0.035, marking a 250% rise during development. More than 820M tokens have been purchased so far. Out of the full supply of 4B, 1.82B tokens were allocated to early supporters. Phase 6 now sits above 99% allocation, showing that supply at the current price is becoming limited. Community engagement remains active due to the project’s 24-hour leaderboard, where the top contributor each day earns $500 in MUTM. This creates steady interest and encourages new users to join. Mutuum Finance also supports card payment, which makes onboarding simple and fast for users who are new to crypto or prefer direct payment routes. Why Investors Expect MUTM To Outperform Top crypto investors studying both assets highlight several differences that may shape long-term performance. PEPE is a meme asset with a large market cap that now moves slowly. Its early surge was built purely on sentiment. Without utility or a revenue model, the token struggles to produce consistent growth. Many traders say PEPE already passed its explosive phase and now sits in a zone where upside will be limited. Mutuum Finance sits at the opposite end of the spectrum. It is early, priced low and built around yield, collateral logic and structured lending mechanics. The mtToken system gives users real APY based on protocol usage. The buy-and-distribute model uses a portion of platform revenue to buy MUTM from the market and distribute purchased tokens to users who stake mtTokens. This creates long-term buy pressure tied to actual economic activity. Timing plays a major role. Many early DOGE and PEPE investors are rotating into smaller-cap DeFi tokens because they want early-stage growth rather than slow movement from meme assets. Mutuum Finance is in this early zone, and its steady progress has helped build confidence. The project also recorded a $115K whale allocation, which reduced the remaining supply and increased visibility among retail traders. Whale entries often signal deeper belief in long-term growth. Phase 6 is moving quickly, and the small amount of allocation left has added urgency for investors who see the project moving closer to its launch price of $0.06. Roadmap Alignment Mutuum Finance is preparing a USD-pegged stablecoin supported by borrower interest. Stablecoins help expand DeFi markets by offering predictable value for borrowing and liquidity management. They often attract deeper participation and help platforms scale faster. The protocol plans to use Chainlink feeds for accurate pricing. Backup oracle layers and aggregated data protect users from liquidation mistakes. Lending markets depend on accurate price inputs, and analysts note that reliable oracle design is an important difference between successful lending protocols and those that fail early. Pepecoin’s ability to grow today is limited by size and lack of utility. Mutuum Finance is at a much earlier stage, priced at $0.035, supported by mtToken yield, buy pressure from revenue, strong audits, expanding participation and a confirmed Q4 V1 testnet.

According to research from cybersecurity firm Kaspersky, the scammers are inserting malware into pirate mods for Roblox and other games to steal crypto login credentials from users. According to a post from Kaspersky, there is now a new variety of infostealer called Stealka, which it has so far encountered on distribution platforms like GitHub, SourceForge, Softpedia, and sites.google.com. The malware is disguised as unofficial mods, cheats, and cracks for Windows-based games and other apps. Stealka is used by scammers to exfiltrate sensitive login and browser information, which they in turn use to steal digital assets. Scammers deploy new malware to steal digital assets The malware primarily targets data contained in browsers such as Chrome, Opera, Firefox, Edge, Yandex, Brave, as well as the settings and databases of over 100 browser extensions. The extensions include digital asset wallets from Binance, Crypto.com, MetaMask, and Trust Wallet. It also targets password managers like LastPass, NordPass, and 1Password, and 2FA apps like Google Authenticator, Authy, and Bitwarden. In addition, Kaspersky noted that Stealka doesn’t stop with browser extensions, noting that it can also lift encrypted private keys, seed phrase data, and wallet file paths from standalone cryptocurrency wallet apps. This includes applications like MyCrypto, MyMonero, Binance, Exodus, as well as other applications for Bitcoin, Ethereum, Solar, Novacoin, Monero, Dogecoin, and BitcoinABC. Kaspersky cybersecurity expert Artem Ushkov explained that the new malware was detected by the company’s endpoint solutions for Windows machines in November. The Stealka malware can also steal data and authentication tokens for messaging apps like Discord and Telegram, password managers, email clients like Mailbird and Outlook, note taking applications like StickyNotes on Microsoft, Notezilla, NoteFly, and VPN clients like Windscribe, OpenVPN, and ProtonVPN. Ushkov details the activities of the malware According to Ushkov, the malware is based in Russia, targeting mainly users from that region. However, attacks by the malware have also been detected in other countries, including Türkiye, Brazil, Germany, and India,” he added. In view of this threat, Kaspersky has advised users to stay away from ploys by scammers trying to use this malware and others to steal their credentials. They have urged users to stay away from unofficial or pirated mods, noting the need to use antivirus software from reputable companies. The blog also advised users against storing important and sensitive information in browsers, asking them to employ the use of two-factor authentication wherever available. In addition, they are asked to use backup codes in most situations, urging them not to store these codes on browsers or in text documents. In addition, users are enjoined to be watchful of where they download games and other files from, noting that these scammers play on users’ need to download free files from unofficial sources. In a popular case mentioned by authorities this week, an entrepreneur based in Singapore lost his entire crypto portfolio after downloading a fake game. The entrepreneur said he came across a beta testing opportunity for Telegram in an online game called MetaToy. He noted that he felt the game was genuine because of some metrics, including the appearance of its website and the activity of its Discord. However, after downloading the game launcher, he unknowingly installed malware, which wiped more than $14,189 in crypto from his system. While scammers can use Stealka to steal personal info and digital assets, there is no indication that it has done any huge damage, the cybersecurity expert noted. “We are not aware of the amount of crypto that has been stolen using it,” said Ushkov. “Our solutions protect against this threat: all detected Stealka malware was blocked by our solutions.” This means that it remains unknown if scammers have used the malware to steal digital assets and the scale of their theft.

In a video tweet, the analyst focused on timing and probability rather than speculation, outlining why the next two weeks may be critical for the XRP price trend. His assessment relies on recurring historical patterns, sentiment indicators, and current market positioning, all of which he argues are aligning in a way previously associated with major moves. IF YOU HOLD #XRP I GOT NEWS FOR YOU!!! Watch asap! https://t.co/LXZhDy3e2t pic.twitter.com/M1c3q0V9Lm — STEPH IS CRYPTO (@Steph_iscrypto) December 17, 2025 Weekly Structure and Historical Precedent A central part of the analysis examines XRP’s position relative to the 50-week simple moving average on the weekly chart. The analyst notes that XRP has once again fallen below this level, a condition that has repeatedly preceded strong recoveries in past cycles. In 2018, 2021, and 2024, XRP remained below this moving average for several weeks before transitioning into sustained rallies. Those periods resulted in gains ranging from moderate to very large, depending on the cycle. According to the analyst, XRP is now within the same time window that historically marked the end of prolonged downside phases. Based on these comparisons, he suggests that a retest of the 50-week moving average from below is likely, with the potential for further upside if historical behavior repeats. Sentiment Data Points to Exhaustion The video also highlights sentiment conditions using the Crypto Fear and Greed Index. XRP is currently experiencing an extended period of extreme fear, a state that has previously coincided with price stabilization and subsequent recoveries. The analyst points to prior instances where prolonged fear lasted more than a month before giving way to sharp upward moves. The reappearance of similar sentiment patterns is presented as evidence that selling pressure may be nearing exhaustion. Macro Events and the Bank of Japan Decision Macroeconomic factors are also addressed, particularly the Bank of Japan’s confirmed interest rate hike to 0.75 percent. Past rate increases by the Bank of Japan aligned with significant corrections in XRP and the crypto market overall. However, the analyst emphasizes that previous hikes occurred after market advances, while the current environment has already seen a decline ahead of the decision. This difference leads him to believe that the upcoming rate hike is largely reflected in current prices, reducing the probability of an additional sharp sell-off.

These conditions are interpreted as signs that speculative excess has been cleared. At the same time, continued positive XRP ETF inflows are highlighted as evidence of ongoing institutional demand. Taken together, the analyst concludes that current conditions favor the formation of a local bottom, with a meaningful move potentially approaching , even if the exact timing remains uncertain.
