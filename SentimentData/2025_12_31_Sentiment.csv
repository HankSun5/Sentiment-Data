The DEX officials have not yet issued a formal announcement to explain the origin of the delay and when they intend to fix the outage. Growing concerns among traders reveal that withdrawals on the Lighter exchange are failing. According to reports from the exchange’s users, withdrawal requests are prompting an error message stating “Too many L2 Withdrawals.” The error message hints that the Layer-2 withdrawal queue may be overcrowded or unable to keep up with user requests due to the Prover’s lag. A lag between Lighter’s Prover and its Sequencer is credited for the withdrawal delays Expect Panic at the Disco until Lighter actually communicates in Discord — zk baby. Withdrawals will pile up, transaction fails common, reversions and not a single post from team, just the Lighter candle holders. Can we get a Gauntlet thinkpiece on withdrawal ADLs? pic.twitter.com/0zK9strL4j — Mister Todd (@pondermint) December 30, 2025 The disruption is allegedly caused by a processing lag between the exchange’s Prover and its Sequencer, causing significant delays when finalizing withdrawals. On-chain data from Lighter’s explorer shows that the last committed block (Block #137759880) was finalized approximately 9 hours prior to the time of this publication. One of the most recent visible blocks recorded only one transaction and a single withdrawal log, showcasing a significant slowdown in withdrawal processing on the trading platform. Lighter has not issued a formal statement to address the cause of the withdrawal disruptions or when the issue will be sorted. The lack of communication has left users wondering whether the protocol is queuing withdrawals or temporarily restricting orders at the protocol level. Disruptions facing withdrawal transactions on Layer 2 platforms often spark a wave of concern among users due to their reliance on sequencers and provers when transferring funds back to Layer 1. Lighter users now depend on error messages and on-chain data to monitor the status of their funds. The disruptions emerged as Lighter rolled out its native Lighter Infrastructure Token (LIT) on Tuesday. A previous report by Cryptopolitan detailed that the token would start trading on Lighter’s platforms before spreading to other exchanges. The Lighter team announced the structure of the token, highlighting its key use cases as part of a growing ecosystem. The token launch included an airdrop campaign to early adopters worth 25% of the token’s fully diluted value. Lighter stated that a portion of the revenue generated from the project’s decentralized exchange will be allocated for token buybacks and growth-oriented use cases, contingent upon prevailing market conditions. The token buyback program is part of the developers’ strategy to create long-term value for the protocol’s community members. According to data from CoinMarketCap, a cryptocurrency data aggregator, Lighter’s LIT is currently trading at $2.84, with a market capitalization of $710 million and a 24-hour trading volume of $8.3 million. The crypto asset is up 5.72% and has hit a high of $4.04 since its launch. Data from Coingecko shows that Lighter has registered open interests worth $1.4 billion in the last 24 hours and reached a trading volume of $3.6 billion in the last day. DEX perpetual futures trading is gaining popularity among traders Perpetual futures trading on decentralized exchanges has experienced explosive growth in 2025 on platforms such as Hyperliquid, Lighter, and Aster. Cryptopolitan previously reported that derivatives trading on DEXs surged in 2025 as traders sought ways to amplify their exposure with limited capital. The report highlighted that perpetual futures monthly trades have exceeded $1 trillion, with Hyperliquid leading the pack. Hyperliquid recently announced it had onboarded more than 600,000 new users in 2025 and achieved $844 million in revenue. Cryptopolitan reported that the DEX drew a total of $3.87 billion in inflows and a total trading volume of $2.95 trillion, spanning 198.9 billion transactions since January this year. During the year, the decentralized exchange averaged about $8.34 billion per day, with spot trading volume on the exchange exceeding $116 billion. HIP-3 trading activities also surged, reaching $11 billion. Bitcoin was the most actively traded cryptocurrency on the platform, achieving a trading volume of $1.16 trillion.

On-chain data shows that validator deposits have once again outpaced exits, even after months of higher withdrawal activity, reflecting improved sentiment among holders. Notably, the change is being closely watched as a potential catalyst that could tighten supply and support a move towards or above the $4,000 level. Ethereum Staking Deposits Overtake Withdrawals Ethereum is seeing a notable shift in staking activity as validator deposits have surpassed withdrawals for the first time in six months. Validator entry queues have surged to more than twice the size of exit queues, pointing to renewed demand for staking and growing confidence among institutional partners and ETH long-term holders . Data from ValidatorQueue shows that Ethereum’s validator entry queue has climbed to roughly 788,310 ETH, at the time of writing. At current prices, this represents about $2.3 billion in value and comes with an estimated wait time of 13 days and 16 hours to activate new validators. By contrast, ETH’s validator exit queue remains significantly smaller, standing at around 312,091, valued at approximately $916,923, as of writing. Notably, the current level represents the highest ETH volume queued for staking since late November. A surge in staking inflows above withdrawals has also been frequently associated with bullish price action for Ethereum. Meanwhile, treasury buyers have played a significant role in this increase in validator entry queues, with Ethereum-focused firm Bitmine leading the way. Data from LookOnChain reveals that the crypto company staked 342,560 ETH on December 28, valued at roughly $1 billion. Bitmine’s staking activity comes as it prepares to launch its Made in America Validator Network (MAVAN) in 2026. Such large-scale staking by treasury firms typically reduces ETH’s liquid supply, which, in turn, can support higher prices. Beyond treasury companies, Ethereum’s broader network participation is also rising. ValidatorQueue reports that there are now more than 983,060 active validators on the blockchain, representing approximately 29.29% of the total supply, or around 35.5 million ETH, currently staked. Moreover, the Ethereum Pectra upgrade has improved users’ staking experience and raised maximum validator limits, making restating easier for large balances. How This Could Push ETH Price Past $4,000 Historically, periods when the Ethereum validator entry queue exceeds the exit queue have often preceded major ETH price rallies. Analysts note that the last time staking deposits surpassed withdrawals, in June 2025, Ethereum’s price had doubled over a short span. If history repeats itself, the cryptocurrency could experience another sharp rally in 2026 . From its current price of above $2,930, a continuation of trends could push it well above $4,000. Analysts also confirm that ETH is currently testing the $3,000 level, and a strong bounce from this zone could open the path toward $4,000.",Ethereum|ETH|ETH news|ETH Price|ethereum news|ethereum price|ethusd|ETHUSDT,EN,0,0,ETH|TRADING|DIGITAL ASSET TREASURY|MACROECONOMICS|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-12-30 22:00:50

Over the past year, the network generated more than $1.5 billion in revenue, exceeding Ethereum and Hyperliquid combined. This outcome reinforced Solana’s scale-driven economic model at a time when fee pressure challenged rival networks. Besides revenue growth, the performance strengthened confidence in Solana’s long-term throughput strategy and market positioning heading into 2026. Solana Revenue Surge Redefines Network Economics Data from Blockworks Research showed Solana leading all blockchains in annual revenue during 2025. Hyperliquid followed with $780 million, while Ethereum posted $690 million for the same period. Consequently, Solana outperformed both networks despite maintaining some of the lowest transaction fees in the market. ​​Solana co-founder Anatoly Yakovenko celebrated the results on X, citing capacity expansion and cost efficiency. He emphasized that scale, not high fees, drove sustainable revenue growth. Significantly, Solana achieved this outcome while keeping median transaction fees below one cent. This structure allowed massive volume growth, which translated into higher aggregate revenue. Additionally, other blockchains trailing Solana included Tron, BNB Chain, Bitcoin, Base, Arbitrum, Optimism, and Avalanche. Price Action and Market Position Entering 2026 Source: CoinCodex Solana’s market price reflected modest stability alongside its recent revenue milestone. SOL traded at $123.89, showing limited movement over the past week with a 0.30% decline. Despite muted price action, trading activity remained firm, with 24-hour volume at $6.46 billion, indicating sustained liquidity. With roughly 560 million SOL in circulation, Solana’s market capitalization stood near $69.74 billion. However, December delivered choppy price action, leaving sentiment mixed. According to Onur, Solana enters 2026 at a technical crossroads where direction remains uncertain. Hence, traders now balance strong fundamentals against cautious short-term signals. Technical Levels, ETFs, and Derivatives Signals Historical data showed Solana often rebounded in January after weak December closes. In 2023, the token surged 140% following year-end selling pressure. Even in 2025, SOL recovered with a 22% January gain after a red December. Additionally, ETF flows offered support, as Solana-linked products avoided weekly net outflows since launch. Total inflows recently exceeded $755 million, indicating selective institutional interest. However, derivatives markets sent mixed signals. Futures positioning remained net short across several venues, including Hyperliquid. Consequently, analysts watched open interest closely for signs of conviction. Onur highlighted $129 as a pivotal resistance level. A sustained close above could open a move toward the mid-$160 range. Conversely, a drop below $116 could confirm a bearish EMA crossover and deepen corrective pressure.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|ETH|SOL|TRADING|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-12-30 22:00:56

The proposals would amend the Criminal Code and the Criminal Procedure Code of the Russian Federation. The latest move aims to formalize liability for mining digital currency outside the legal framework introduced last year. Under the draft, illegal mining could be punishable by a fine of up to 1.5 million rubles or forced labor for up to two years. Offenses involving especially large income or committed by an organized group could carry prison terms of up to five years. Prison, Forced Labor, Heavy Fines As part of the initiative, the Criminal Code would be amended with a new Article 171.6, titled “Illegal mining of digital currency and activities of a mining infrastructure operator.” The article defines illegal mining as the extraction of digital currency by individuals or entities not included in the official state register of persons engaged in cryptocurrency mining. Liability would arise if such activity causes large-scale damage to citizens, organizations, or the state, or if it generates income of at least 3.5 million rubles. The proposed article provides for penalties, including compulsory labor for up to 480 hours or forced labor for up to two years in cases meeting these thresholds. Tougher sanctions would apply in aggravated circumstances. According to Part Two of the draft article, offenses committed by an organized group, those that result in especially large-scale damage, or those associated with especially large income of more than 13.5 million rubles, could be punishable by fines ranging from 500,000 to 2.5 million rubles or by fines equivalent to one to three years of the offender’s income. Courts could also impose up to five years of forced labor or up to five years in prison, with or without an additional fine of up to 400,000 rubles or six months’ income. The proposal comes after the legalization of cryptocurrency mining in Russia, which came into force in November 2024. On the same day, the Federal Tax Service launched special registries that required all legal entities, individual entrepreneurs, and operators of mining infrastructure involved in the mining sector to register with the authorities. According to the Federal Tax Service, more than 1,000 participants were listed in the registries as of the end of May 2025. Current rules also require all miners, including individuals, to report their mined digital currency on a monthly basis through a dedicated section of the Federal Tax Service’s website. In early December, Deputy Prime Minister Alexander Novak said the Russian government plans to introduce criminal liability in 2026 for illegal cryptocurrency mining as well as for illegal lending. Power Theft by Crypto Miners The crackdown comes amid growing concerns over the strain illegal mining places on Russia’s power infrastructure. Earlier this year, Rosseti Group, the country’s state-owned power grid operator, reported losses of more than 1.3 billion rubles in 2024 due to unauthorized “black” mining operations, particularly in the North Caucasus, Novosibirsk, and Volga regions. Some operators ran thousands of devices and illegally drew electricity on an industrial scale, which prompted over 40 criminal investigations.

Three people familiar with the process said authorities have allegedly delivered this message directly to companies seeking clearance. The rule is not written into public policy, but it is being enforced through procurement reviews tied to plant construction and expansion. China is using this gatekeeping method to force local sourcing at scale. Companies are required to submit tenders that clearly list equipment origins. If the domestic share falls below the threshold, approvals usually stop there. Officials may allow limited flexibility when supply gaps exist, especially for advanced production lines where local tools are still incomplete. One person said regulators actually want the ratio higher. “Authorities prefer if it is much higher than 50%,” the source reportedly said. “Eventually, they are aiming for the plants to use 100% domestic equipment.” Chinese authorities tighten chipmaker approvals in efforts to change supply chains inward The requirement gained speed after the United States tightened export rules in 2023. Those measures blocked sales of advanced AI chips and key semiconductor tools to China. While some foreign equipment from the U.S., Japan, South Korea, and Europe remains available, manufacturers are now choosing local suppliers even when alternatives exist. This is no longer about access. It is about compliance. Applications that fail the sourcing test are often rejected. For advanced lines, the rules ease slightly because domestic gear does not fully cover every step. Even then, firms must show clear intent to localize over time. The policy stands as one of the strongest moves yet to cut reliance on foreign technology. It also reshapes purchasing decisions across the entire chip sector. State-linked buyers are already responding. Public procurement data shows 421 orders for domestic lithography tools and components this year, valued at about 850 million yuan. That marks a sharp rise in demand for locally developed machines. To support this shift, Beijing continues to fund the sector through the Big Fund, which launched a third phase in 2024 with 344 billion yuan, equal to about $49 billion. Domestic equipment makers gain ground under pressure President Xi Jinping has framed chip independence as a “whole nation” effort. Thousands of engineers and researchers across companies and labs are involved. Earlier this month, scientists reported work on a prototype machine capable of producing cutting-edge chips, an outcome Washington has tried to block for years. A former employee at Naura Technology allegedly said that fabs once favored U.S. tools. “Before, domestic fabs like SMIC would prefer U.S. equipment and would not really give Chinese firms a chance,” the person said. “But that changed starting with the 2023 U.S export restrictions, when Chinese fabs had no choice but to work with domestic suppliers.” The policy is already reshaping results. In etching, a key step that removes material from silicon wafers, Naura is testing tools on a 7nm production line at SMIC, after earlier success at 14nm. One source said the mandate sped up progress. “Naura’s etching results have been accelerated by the government requiring fabs to use at least 50% domestic equipment,” the person allegedly said. Foreign suppliers like Lam Research and Tokyo Electron once dominated this segment. Now they are being partially replaced by Naura and Advanced Micro-Fabrication Equipment. Naura also supplies memory chipmakers with etching tools for chips exceeding 300 layers and developed electrostatic chucks to replace parts that Lam could no longer service after 2023. Naura filed 779 patents in 2025, more than double its filings in 2020 and 2021, while AMEC filed 259. And Naura’s first-half 2025 sales rose 30% to 16 billion yuan, while AMEC reported a 44% jump to 5 billion yuan, according to Reuters.

Allegedly, the last tranche may have even been closer to $22.5 billion, but either way, it’s done. The Japanese conglomerate now holds over 10% ownership in the Sam Altman-led AI powerhouse because apparently, a few billion here and there just wasn’t enough, and the final payment was transferred last week, with a deal that’s been in the works since early 2024. SoftBank had initially invested $8 billion directly into the ChatGPT creator, then brought in a crew of co-investors to syndicate another $10 billion. OpenAI is preparing for IPO and massive infrastructure plans The SoftBank-OpenAI deal was originally priced at a $260 billion pre-money valuation, and SoftBank was expected to drip out the funds across 12 to 24 months, with some of the capital earmarked for OpenAI’s wild Stargate venture with Oracle and the White House, among others. Just a few weeks ago, SoftBank dumped its entire $5.8 billion stake in Nvidia . People close to the matter have allegedly said the Nvidia sale, plus other liquidity moves, were aimed at fueling the OpenAI mega-deal. And now that it’s finalized, there’s no ambiguity about where that money went. Over the next few years, OpenAI is planning to throw more than $1.4 trillion into infrastructure. That’s trillion with a T. The spending spree includes deep collaborations with Nvidia (again), AMD, and Broadcom. Everyone’s cashing in on the AI boom—and SoftBank wants a front-row seat. The startup isn’t just collecting checks from Tokyo, either. Microsoft has been backing it for years. Amazon is reportedly exploring a $10 billion investment, and even Disney slid in recently with a $1 billion deal, letting Sora, OpenAI’s video generator, use its roster of characters.

The move not only strengthens BitMine’s position as a major validator but also shows the company’s deep institutional commitment to Ethereum’s long-term value proposition, particularly as it continues to expand its total ETH holdings, which now reportedly exceed 4.1 million ETH. Additionally, BitMine is actively developing its “Made in America Validator Network (MAVAN),” slated for launch in the first quarter of 2026, indicating a major infrastructure play alongside its substantial asset accumulation. California’s Crypto Tax Quake: Unrealized Gains Proposal Sparks Exodus Fears The “ 2026 Billionaire Tax Act ” is also driving capital flight fears. The proposal seeks a 5% annual tax on net wealth above $1 billion, explicitly targeting unrealized gains in crypto assets. Critics like Kraken co-founder Jesse Powell argue that this forces founders to liquidate positions to pay taxes on paper profits, potentially triggering structural selling pressure if passed. The implications of such a tax extend beyond just billionaires, potentially setting a precedent that could ripple through the entire U.S. crypto industry. The difficulty in accurately valuing often volatile crypto assets for annual tax purposes, especially those with limited liquidity, presents a major practical and administrative challenge. Should this bill gain traction, the “pre-emptive exodus” of crypto-native capital from Silicon Valley to more tax-friendly jurisdictions like the UAE or Florida could rapidly accelerate before the 2026 tax year begins, potentially altering the development of the sector and investment within the state.

Key momentum indicators suggest selling pressure is fading, while long-term holders appear to be quietly absorbing supply. Although price action remains cautious for now, the setup is sparking discussions about whether XRP is positioning itself for another major move once market confidence returns. A Rare Momentum Reset On The Higher Timeframe In a significant technical development on XRP’s high-timeframe charts, Steph is Crypto has highlighted that the Stochastic RSI on the 3-week interval has plummeted to a value of 0.00. This level represents a state of total compression for the oscillator, signaling a momentum shift that is rare in the asset’s trading history. Related Reading: XRP Price Trims Upside, Slow Decline Signals Seller Dominance The rarity of this signal cannot be overstated, as it has occurred only once before at the absolute depths of the 2022 bear market. Historically, when the indicator reaches zero, it serves as a definitive marker that the prevailing selling pressure has reached a point of total exhaustion. From a structural perspective, it indicates that the energy behind the downward trend has completely dried up. It is important to note that this does not guarantee an immediate recovery. When this technical phenomenon surfaced in previous cycles, it preceded a prolonged accumulation phase. During that period, the price stabilized as smart money began to build positions, creating a foundation for the next major impulsive move toward the upside. Seeing this signal reappear now suggests that XRP’s downside risk is structurally limited at current valuations. It points to a market environment where long-term holders are actively absorbing the available supply, transitioning from a distribution phase to a period of strategic positioning. A Familiar Market Rhythm Is Emerging on XRP’s Long-Term Chart Altcoin Pioneers, in a recent update, highlighted a striking fractal pattern forming on XRP’s chart, suggesting that history may be repeating with remarkable accuracy. A 3-day chart comparison reveals strong similarities between the 2016–2017 market cycle and the current structure, both shaped by a prolonged ABC corrective phase before a major breakout. Related Reading: XRP Exchange Inflows Spike To End 2025: Will Price Decline Deepen? In the earlier cycle, XRP spent months completing its correction before launching into an explosive rally. The 2024 structure mirrors the past ABC pattern, while the ongoing 2025–2026 correction is aligning closely with the final C-wave down to the $1.87 region, though on a slightly shorter timeline. If this fractal continues to play out, Altcoin Pioneers believe XRP could be nearing the end of a painful shakeout phase, setting the stage for the next powerful upside leg. XRP has followed this script before, and those who held through the last cycle understand what’s coming next.

56617683,649540,1767135636,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/56617683.jpeg,Here’s The XRP Fractal That Says Price Is Headed To $27,https://bitcoinist.com/fractal-says-xrp-is-headed-to-27/,"A technical analysis shared by EGRAG CRYPTO outlines a specific fractal structure that he believes is still guiding XRP’s broader price behavior. The model does not frame the move as inevitable, and it leaves room for uncertainty . Instead, it outlines a conditional roadmap based on how XRP continues to move within a white fractal that the analyst says is tracking with roughly 82% accuracy and, if maintained, points to a possible advance to as high as $27. What The White Fractal Is Showing Right Now The focus of the analysis is what EGRAG refers to as the White Fractal, which is the most realistic version of the different fractals he is currently tracking. Unlike earlier fractal iterations, this one is treated as an evolving structure that must continue to align with price action to keep being valid. According to the analyst, the current setup is about 82% aligned with XRP’s price action this year, based on similarities in accumulation behavior, breakout formation, and interaction with exponential moving averages. EGRAG was careful to note that this version has not yet earned a full upgrade to his higher-confidence blue or green fractals, keeping expectations grounded in what the structure is actually delivering so far. How The Fractal Projects XRP Price Targets The prediction for XRP’s price outlook is a sequence of price zones, each tied to a declining probability as price action moves higher. According to the projection, the most statistically favored outcome is around the $3.20 level, which EGRAG assigns a 75% probability if the fractal structure continues to play out. From there, the roadmap allows for a continuation to $8, although the probability drops to about 65% due to the additional momentum and participation required for XRP to sustain that move. After $8, the fractal begins to enter more speculative price territories. The next price target zone is around $15 to $16, and EGRAG places the probability here at around 55%. The final and most ambitious zone sits between $20 and $27, which he assigns a 50% probability. This upper range represents the peak end of the fractal projection and corresponds with the final expansion phase shown in the chart above. EGRAG estimates that, if the structure is valid, the expansion phase would most likely unfold between June 2026 and October 2026. However, he was careful to note that these projections are not guarantees. A sustained break below $1.60 would reduce the probability of XRP’s price action following projections by the fractal. A deeper move below $1.30 would mean that XRP’s current cycle has diverged too far from the fractal being referenced, which invalidates the model entirely.",XRP|Egrag Crypto|ripple|White Fractal|XRP news|XRP price|XRPUSD|XRPUSDT,EN,0,0,MARKET|TRADING|XRP|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-12-30 23:00:36

That would make it the best performance in five years for the group, second only to tech. Companies from Nucor to Sherwin-Williams, and packaging giants like Smurfit WestRock and Ball Corp., are in the spotlight. The rise is tied directly to trade protections and a sharp shift in consumer goods demand. Metals and packaging stocks will lead the charge, both forecast to post over 30% profit growth. Steel prices are up, and companies selling boxes and cans are seeing more orders as food brands push volume using discounts. Steelmakers prepare for backlog boost as tariffs drive prices Richard Bourke from Bloomberg Intelligence said tariffs on imported steel are giving U.S. producers more control over pricing. “U.S. mills should continue to displace imports as long as 50% Section 232 tariffs remain in place,” he wrote. These are the same Trump-era levies still shaping trade today. Nucor, which Bourke called the U.S. mill with the widest product range and some extra capacity, reported a strong order book for 2026. It pointed to projects in energy, infrastructure, data centers, and manufacturing as key drivers. In a December update, the company said existing policy should lead to “continued gradual improvement in business conditions.” Steel Dynamics also flagged a larger backlog. The company expects lower interest rates to help push up infrastructure spending and bring more production back to the U.S. Bourke explained that many of the orders in play are lag contracts, meaning the money won’t show up until next year. The packaging sector isn’t having the same smooth ride. Tariffs here are more of a burden, but some companies are getting help from their clients. General Mills and PepsiCo have been promoting products more aggressively, which means higher volume. Truist’s Michael Roxland said this trend has boosted Amcor and similar suppliers. Jefferies analysts believe easier year-over-year comparisons and a slow return of consumer confidence could help the sector in the second half of the year. But right now, it’s tight. RBC’s Matthew McKellar said mills in North America are already near full capacity, which could support a price hike. Packaging, chemicals, and construction firms shift strategy for growth Packaging companies are reacting with internal changes. Amcor CEO Peter Konieczny said the company plans to meet its 2026 targets using synergies, not economic improvement. The company sees adjusted profit growth of 12% to 17%, its best in five years. Still, the overall picture in packaging is messy. Growth from food producers hasn’t extended to other customers, so firms are turning to cost cuts and plant closures to manage softer demand and economic drag. International Paper, which had four years of declining profits, now expects a turnaround. But the company isn’t upbeat. Executives told an industry event in December that demand is still weak. They blamed inflation, trade pressure, and the sluggish housing market. “In North America, we still feel very tight from a supply-demand perspective,” said CFO Lance Loeffler. “All we need is a little bit of spark on the demand side, and I think it would be really good for business.” Outside packaging and metals, the remaining materials sub-sectors are hoping for a rate-cut lifeline. Chemicals are forecast to finally grow after three rough years. The same goes for construction materials, which dropped in 2025 but are set to rebound. Sherwin-Williams is ready to benefit if home sales pick up, said Citigroup’s Patrick Cunningham. Albemarle is also expected to gain ground thanks to higher lithium prices from rising demand in energy storage. For construction stocks, like CRH, falling interest rates could lower borrowing costs and push more projects forward. BI analyst Sonia Baldeira said this could help unlock residential and commercial construction deals stuck in limbo. Every piece of this puzzle points to a rare winning streak for the materials sector, one fueled by tariffs, backlogs, tighter supply, and cost cuts.

Cypherpunk Now Holds Nearly 2%,https://cryptonews.com/news/zcash-cypherpunk-corporate-treasury-play-bitcoin/,"Cypherpunk Technologies has deepened its bet on Zcash, adding fuel to a growing debate over whether privacy-focused cryptocurrencies can play a role similar to Bitcoin in corporate treasuries. The Nasdaq-listed company said it purchased an additional 56,418.09 ZEC for about $29 million at an average price of $514.02 per token. With the latest transaction, Cypherpunk now holds 290,062.67 ZEC, equal to roughly 1.76% of Zcash’s circulating supply. The company said its total position was accumulated at a blended average price of $334.41 per ZEC. Cypherpunk Sets Its Sights on 5% of the Zcash Network Chief investment officer Will McEvoy said the company is working toward a long-term goal of holding 5% of the Zcash network. He framed the strategy around the growing relevance of financial privacy while also pointing to plans to expand into other privacy-focused technologies. The move comes after a sharp corporate pivot, as the firm was formerly known as Leap Therapeutics before rebranding in November as Cypherpunk Technologies and has now repositioned itself as a Zcash-focused digital asset company. Its stock has been increasing almost 170% since the rebrand, up to approximately $1.18 compared to approximately $0.44, as per Google Finance. Source: Google Finance Zcash, in its turn, has been registering among the most robust performances in the crypto market this year. The token has increased over 800% in the last 12 months and currently trades at roughly $530, based on CoinGecko. Source: CoinGecko Bitcoin, by comparison, is down by approximately 5% over the same period, though ZEC was up almost 27% in the past 7 days alone. Notably, Zcash daily trade volume dropped by approximately half to approximately 499 million dollars in the last 24 hours, showing that activity slowed following the recent explosion. As Bitcoin Dominates Treasuries, Zcash Offers a Privacy Alternative Zcash is a fork of Bitcoin, which was released in 2016 and has many structural features in common with BTC, such as a limit of 21 million coins and a proof-of-work blockchain. The difference lies in the privacy, in which Zcash employs zero-knowledge, known as zk-SNARKs , proofs that users can use to conceal the transaction information like sender, recipient, and value, yet still provide optional transparency and auditability by using viewing keys. Those features have shaped how ZEC is being discussed as a treasury asset. Bitcoin’s appeal to corporations has rested on verifiable scarcity, deep liquidity, and growing regulatory clarity, reinforced by the approval of U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs earlier this year. Companies holding BTC typically treat it as a long-term store of value or macro hedge, with potential returns tied to price appreciation rather than operating income. Zcash, by comparison, is often described by companies adopting it as a hedge centered on privacy. Cypherpunk and a small number of other firms, including Reliance Global Group, have cited the need to protect sensitive financial activity as a reason to hold ZEC. Like Bitcoin, Zcash does not generate cash flow, and any treasury “revenue” would come from unrealized or realized gains if prices rise. Market participants are divided on near-term price direction, with Former BitMEX CEO Arthur Hayes saying ZEC could be setting up for a move toward $1,000, pointing to potential liquidity shifts that may favor privacy-focused assets. The tears of the bears shall be my sustenance. $ZEC first stop $1k pic.twitter.com/FPCZbNxMTj — Arthur Hayes (@CryptoHayes) December 29, 2025 However, others are more cautious, as analyst Eric Van Tassel has warned a pullback toward $400 is possible, while macro investor Raoul Pal recently described Zcash’s rally as looking more like capital rotation than a confirmed long-term trend. Even after its recent surge, Zcash remains more than 80% below its all-time high of $3,191.93. The post Is Zcash the Next Corporate Treasury Play?

Top altcoins like Ethereum (ETH) and XRP (XRP) have swung to negative territory on a year-to-date (YTD) basis, while BNB (BNB) has managed to deliver 21% during this period. Where could these three coins be heading at the beginning of 2026? Gemini, Google’s powerful AI model, shared with us its predictions for these altcoins. #1 – Gemini Prediction for XRP (XRP) XRP (XRP) consolidated this year following a strong spike in late 2024. Its legal victory in a long-standing case against the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), along with robust ecosystem growth initiatives, has influenced its price action in 2025. According to Gemini, the key support to watch to prevent a big decline to $1.20 would be the $1.75 area. Meanwhile, its most relevant resistance sits at $2.36. This is where the 200-day exponential moving average (EMA) sits for the token. A move above this mark would confirm a bullish outlook for XRP. Gemini predicts the following for the first quarter of 2026: “ The sharp drops seem to have halted, suggesting a potential bottoming process in early 2026. ” #2 – Gemini Prediction for Ethereum (ETH) Ethereum’s performance this year was mostly influenced by the successful implementation of the Pectra upgrade back in April. This technical overhaul propelled the price to a new all-time high just a few months later. Gemini indicates that the key support to watch at the time is the $2,800 area. A break below this mark could result in a drop to $2,400 in the near term. Meanwhile, the $3,370 area seems to be the key resistance that the price must overcome to rally back to the $4,000 zone. Its baseline prediction for Ethereum for the beginning of 2026 is consolidation. Gemini concluded the following based on its analysis of the latest price action: “ETH is likely to trade sideways in early 2026 as it builds a base. ” #3 – Gemini Prediction for BNB Coin (BNB) BNB Coin (BNB) has been this year’s top-performing token in the top 5. The growing popularity of decentralized protocols like Aster and Pancake Swap has contributed to increasing the network’s transaction volumes. The token reached a new all-time high recently at $1,360. Gemini sees the $800 level as the key support to watch if the price pulls back in the first few weeks of 2026. Meanwhile, BNB needs to rise past the $1,000 psychological barrier to rally back to the highs seen in October. Gemini sees this upcoming first quarter of 2026 as a “decision point” for the market. The AI model concluded the following regarding BNB’s outlook: “ Early 2026 will likely see a decisive move away from the $850 pivot. Given the flat RSI (47), a bounce is slightly more probable than a crash if the general crypto market stabilizes. ” Gemini Thinks The Market Has Bottomed Already After an assessment of the price action of these top three altcoins, Gemini shared this interesting take about the state of the crypto market: “The charts suggest that the crypto market is in a late-stage correction or early accumulation phase . The explosive growth of mid-2025 has faded, and early 2026 will likely be defined by capital preservation and range-bound trading.” As the market as a whole consolidates, seizing the most attractive opportunities in certain categories like meme coins could make a big difference. Top crypto presales like Maxi Doge ($MAXI) are potential hidden gems that could deliver interesting gains as a new year begins. Maxi Doge ($MAXI) Raises Over $4M to Bring Meme’s Hype to the Trading Space Maxi Doge ($MAXI) is an Ethereum meme coin inspired by the popular Doge meme.

XMR/USDT price chart: TradingView Monero price analysis gives a bullish prediction regarding the ongoing market trends, as the coin’s price is increasing after price crashed from the $480 mark. If sellers hold the ongoing momentum, XMR’s estimated price might decrease to the $420 range. However, if the bulls continue to hold the $430 level, the price can then be expected to rise to $460 again. Is Monero a good investment? Monero is an attractive investment because it emphasizes privacy and security, utilizing advanced cryptographic techniques to ensure transaction confidentiality, which has created a strong demand in the market . Its growing adoption across various use cases and a decentralized development model enhance its long-term potential. With a limited supply and increasing investor interest, Monero offers a unique opportunity for those seeking financial autonomy and privacy to invest in cryptocurrency. However, investors should remain cautious of regulatory risks and market volatility when considering Monero as part of their portfolio, making it essential to seek investment advice. Why is XMR down? Monero price analysis shows that XMR saw a sharp drop after being rejected at the $480 mark resulting in a drop to the current $435 level. Will XMR recover to its all-time high? Monero is expected to recover toward its all-time high of $518 by mid-2026 as the privacy chain continues to reduce its tech debt and progresses toward greater utility and privacy. However, the platform might have to overcome regulatory scrutiny and challenges before it can see mass adoption, as it remains highly speculative . How much will Monero be worth in 5 years? The Monero price prediction for 2030 suggests a minimum price of $1,048.76 and an average trading price of $1,142.11 . The maximum forecasted price is set at $1,208.35. Will XMR reach $1000? The chances of Monero (XMR) hitting $1,000 hinge on various factors, which will influence its future price movements. The adoption of privacy transactions and technological advances could increase demand. Favorable regulations and market sentiment toward privacy coins would also help. Yet, regulatory risks, competition, and market volatility creating an atmosphere of extreme fear are challenges that Monero traders could face that could hinder significant growth. $1,000 is possible with favorable conditions, especially considering the current price but market dynamics and regulations will shape its path. Does XMR have a good long-term future? Monero (XMR) has the potential for a strong long-term future due to its focus on privacy and security, which makes it attractive to users seeking anonymity. However, many investors have concerns regarding privacy, regulatory scrutiny, and notoriety from being the favored medium for some past criminals, which impact the current Monero sentiment. Monero’s commitment to ring confidential transactions and the broader monero project gives it a solid foundation for long-term growth, but it must carefully navigate market and regulatory landscapes.

Monero historic price sentiment XMR price history Monero’s market value has changed dramatically since its launch in 2014, from less than $1 to over $475. May 2021 marked the highest point in Monero’s history. Monero’s price projections revealed the coin’s security. They provide investors with optimism that they will be freed from the persecution of some authorities simply by buying or selling Monero Across 2023, Monero’s price rose by 11.49%. The highest price was $278.56, and the lowest was $114.16. In January 2024, Monero stayed stable around the $150.00 mark as market momentum remained low. However, the stability was short-lived as February crashed to $101.95. However, XMR showed swift recovery as it closed the month near the $150.00 level again. In March and April 2024, XMR saw a steady decline from $150.00 to $120.00, where it found key support. In May 2024, XMR observed steady bullish pressure as the price rose from $120.00, approaching resistance at $150. In June 2024, Monero (XMR) traded within the $150 – $175 price range as either side struggled to make a clear breakthrough. In July, the crypto traded around the $155 mark as the price volatility remained relatively low. XMR opened trading at $156.05 in August and ended the month at $176.00, making remarkable gains. September was bearish for the asset, as the price declined below the $160 mark by the end of the month. In October, Monero observed a steep crash and has been making a swift recovery since then. In December, Monero made remarkable strides as the asset’s price broke past the $220 mark, albeit briefly as it closed the month below $200. In January, Monero saw a bullish January as the price rose from below the $200 mark to $238 by the end of the month. In February, the price fell towards the $215 mark as bears dominate the markets. In March, the price observes mixed momentum and closed the month slightly below $215. In April the consolidation continued until late into the month when it spiked past the $325 mark before ending the month around $275. In May the price continued rising rapidly as the bulls cruised past $300 ending the month around $320. During June the price continued to observe high volatility but observed low net change as the asset closed the month around $313. In July the price saw a huge spike in volatility as the price rose past $340 but the asset closed the month below the $310 mark. In August the price declined rapidly falling to the $260 mark by the month’s end. In September, the price rose to the $340 and while it did not maintain the level but managed to close the month above the $320 mark. In October the price continued to rise ending the month above the $340 mark, a trend separating it from most other cryptocurrencies that saw a decline during the period. In November, the bullish rally continued with XMR crossing the $400 mark by the end of the month.",Crypto Price Predictions,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|BUSINESS|MARKET|TRADING|XMR|FORKS|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-12-30 23:30:00

Hur Jae-hong, chairman and CEO of L&F, watched his listed holdings fall from $800 million to $134 million, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index. The contract, once hailed as game-changing, has officially been downgraded to almost nothing. Tesla’s Cybertruck delays and weak customer demand choked the order before it could deliver. Tesla’s Cybertruck delay kills a key EV battery deal L&F builds high-nickel cathodes for electric vehicle batteries. These were supposed to go straight to Tesla for the Cybertruck. But that model ran into constant delays, and buyers just didn’t bite. No one’s seen much of the angular truck, and L&F’s order quietly died behind the scenes. The company confirmed this week that the massive order is now worth less than $10,000. The stock market didn’t wait for the news. L&F shares have been dropping since their 2023 peak, when the Tesla contract was first announced. They’ve now plunged more than 70%, dragged down by the collapse of the order and a general slump in EV demand worldwide. It didn’t help that L&F was leaning heavily on LG Energy Solution Ltd., its top customer, and investor confidence began to crack long before Monday’s shock filing. Still, analysts say this isn’t a full break-up between L&F and Elon Musk’s company. “L&F had probably already stopped supplying cathodes to Tesla since last year,” said Changmin Lee, an analyst at KB Securities. The materials were only meant for some Cybertruck models, and with that project stalling, the deliveries never picked up. Lee added that the recent filing “will likely be extremely limited” in terms of market impact, since the contract had already been factored out of forecasts. L&F’s long-term partnerships now under pressure Even though the Cybertruck plan crashed, L&F’s business with Tesla still supplies Model Y components indirectly through LG Energy Solution, which accounts for around 80% of its total sales. That pipeline is running without disruption for now. But the loss of the direct Tesla order smashed L&F’s diversification strategy.In 2021, the company inked a deal with Redwood Materials, the US battery recycler run by Tesla’s ex-CTO, JB Straubel. That partnership was supposed to help L&F lower its dependence on LG Energy Solution to 50% by 2025. That goal now looks shaky. There might still be a way out. Anna Lee, an analyst at Yuanta Securities Korea, said L&F is expected to begin production for Rivian in 2026, after securing a deal back in March. They’re also sending mid-nickel cathodes to SK On Co., used in Hyundai Motor’s EV batteries. That means they’ve still got irons in the fire. “A short-term damper in investor sentiment is inevitable,” said Anna. “But there is an increasing possibility that the sector will regain attention in 2026, specifically centering on energy storage systems for AI data centers.” Still, none of that changes the fact that a $2.9 billion Tesla contract just evaporated into dust, and L&F’s billionaire dreams were smashed into seven thousand bucks.

Here’s what history suggests could happen next. Bitcoin Social Volume Suggests Rise Of Greed In a new post on X, analytics firm Santiment has talked about how social media sentiment toward Bitcoin is looking right now. The indicator of relevance here is the “Social Volume,” measuring the total amount of posts/messages/threads on the major social media platforms that are making unique mentions of a given term or topic. Related Reading: Bitcoin Equilibrium: Active Market Participants Just Breaking Even For judging the degree of sentiment around BTC that’s present on social media, Santiment has filtered the indicator for both Bitcoin-related terms and sentiment-related ones. More specifically, the analytics firm has applied to the BTC Social Volume the terms “higher” and “above” to pinpoint bullish comments, and “lower” and “below” to gauge bearish sentiment. Now, here is the chart shared by Santiment that shows how the two types of Bitcoin Social Volume have changed over the last few months: As displayed in the above graph, the Bitcoin Social Volume has just seen an uptick, although not a very significant one. Bullish comments have outpaced the bearish ones in this spike, suggesting that the retail crowd is getting optimistic about where BTC will head as New Year’s approaches. If history is anything to go by, though, this optimism may not actually be a positive sign for the cryptocurrency. Generally, BTC and digital asset markets tend to move in a direction that goes contrary to the expectations of the majority. The analytics firm has noted that many short-term Bitcoin swings in the last three months have followed this pattern. From the chart, it’s visible that a spike in bearish calls has led to price bounces, while greed on social media has coincided with local tops. Considering this trend, it’s possible that the latest surge in positive social media comments surrounding Bitcoin could end up proving to be a bearish signal. Though that said, the intensity of the greedy sentiment hasn’t been too high so far. In some other news, cumulative Bitcoin returns have flattened out for all trading sessions recently, as CryptoQuant community analyst Maartunn has pointed out in an X post. The trading sessions in the chart correspond to periods when users from a specific market are likely to be active. In the first half of December, Bitcoin’s gains were dominated by the US session, but recently, returns have flatlined for all three of the US, Europe, and Asia-Pacific. Related Reading: XRP Exchange Inflows Spike To End 2025: Will Price Decline Deepen? This suggests that no trader demographic is diverging in behavior. “Market momentum is neutral across the board,” noted Maartunn.

56619445,649594,1767139232,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/56619445.jpeg,Ethereum Nearing A Turning Point? Supply-Demand Structure Suggest A Shift Is Coming In 2026,https://bitcoinist.com/ethereum-turning-point-supply-demand-structure/,"Ethereum is once again struggling to regain the $3,000 level, highlighting the fragile state of the market as selling pressure continues to weigh on price action. After multiple failed attempts to push higher, ETH remains locked below key resistance, reflecting broad uncertainty and a lack of conviction among both traders and long-term investors. Market sentiment has deteriorated sharply, with apathy and fear dominating positioning as participants remain hesitant to deploy fresh capital. Rather than aggressive capitulation, the current environment points to exhaustion and indecision, a common feature of late-cycle corrective phases. According to a recent report by XWIN Research Japan on CryptoQuant, Ethereum is now in a late-stage bearish phase that appears to be transitioning into a more range-bound structure. While bearish pressure still dominates the broader trend, the nature of selling activity is changing. Instead of sharp, panic-driven sell-offs, the market is experiencing slower, more methodical distribution, suggesting that many weak hands may have already exited. This shift often marks a critical inflection point, where volatility compresses, and price stabilizes within a defined range. The report notes that such phases typically reflect a market searching for equilibrium. Although this does not guarantee an immediate recovery, it does indicate that downside momentum may be weakening. For Ethereum, the coming weeks will be decisive in determining whether this range evolves into a base for recovery or resolves into another leg lower. Ethereum’s On-Chain Structure Improves As Price Weakness Persists While Ethereum continues to struggle below key resistance levels, on-chain indicators suggest that the underlying market structure may be gradually improving. Data shows ETH leaving exchanges at the fastest pace of this cycle, a move increasingly associated with self-custody, staking, and long-term holding rather than short-term trading activity. This shift is reinforced by validator queue dynamics: for the first time in six months, the entry queue has surpassed the exit queue, with roughly 745,000 ETH waiting to be staked versus around 360,000 ETH queued for withdrawal. The imbalance points to renewed staking participation and a tightening medium- to long-term supply profile. Additional context comes from the 90-day Spot Taker CVD, which indicates a transition away from strongly sell-dominant conditions toward neutral to mildly positive pressure. Although this does not imply an immediate price rebound, it suggests that aggressive selling is beginning to lose intensity. That said, Ethereum ETF flows remain negative on both daily and weekly timeframes, signaling that institutional demand via financial products continues to weigh on price action. Beyond market flows, Ethereum’s network activity remains resilient. Deployed smart contracts reached a record 8.7 million in Q4 2025, while on-chain real-world asset value expanded to approximately $19 billion, led by Ethereum. These trends indicate that usage-driven demand remains intact despite weak sentiment. The data support a scenario of ongoing price pressure alongside gradual structural improvement. This assessment would weaken if exchange balances rise again or sell-side flows regain dominance. Price Remains Below Key Moving Averages Ethereum continues to trade in a tight consolidation near the $2,900–$3,000 zone, reflecting persistent indecision after the sharp correction from the $4,800 cycle peak. The chart shows ETH struggling to reclaim the 50-day and 100-day moving averages, which are now acting as dynamic resistance around the $3,200–$3,600 region. Each attempt to push higher has been met with selling pressure, reinforcing the broader bearish structure that has been in place since November. From a trend perspective, price remains below the declining short-term moving average, while the 200-day moving average near the $3,500 area continues to slope downward. This configuration signals that Ethereum is still trading in a corrective phase rather than a confirmed recovery. However, downside momentum appears to be weakening. The recent series of higher lows around $2,750–$2,800 suggests that buyers are defending this range as a short-term demand zone. Volume has also compressed during the latest consolidation, a sign that aggressive selling may be losing intensity. This aligns with the broader narrative of exhaustion rather than renewed capitulation. Still, without a decisive reclaim of $3,200 and a move back above the 50-day average, any upside attempts remain vulnerable.

This strategic capital deployment, detected by blockchain analytics platform Onchain Lens on March 15, 2025, represents one of the largest single staking moves of the year and provides crucial insights into sophisticated crypto investment strategies. Bitmine ETH Staking Reaches $1.37 Billion Milestone Blockchain data reveals compelling details about Bitmine’s latest maneuver. The entity staked an additional 118,944 ETH, worth approximately $352.16 million at transaction time. Consequently, this substantial allocation elevates Bitmine’s total staked Ethereum to approximately 461,504 ETH, valued at $1.37 billion. Furthermore, a separate transaction occurred approximately one hour later. A new address, also presumably controlled by Bitmine, received 32,938 ETH worth $97.8 million from institutional crypto exchange FalconX. This dual-transaction pattern suggests coordinated capital management. The staking activity demonstrates long-term commitment to Ethereum’s network security. Simultaneously, the FalconX transfer indicates ongoing liquidity management. These movements collectively represent sophisticated treasury operations. Understanding Ethereum’s Proof-of-Stake Mechanism To appreciate Bitmine’s strategy, one must understand Ethereum’s fundamental shift. The network transitioned from proof-of-work to proof-of-stake in September 2022. This consensus mechanism requires validators to stake ETH as collateral. Validators then propose and validate new blocks. They earn rewards for maintaining network security. Currently, the annual percentage yield for staking ranges between 3-5%. Staking serves multiple purposes for institutional players: Yield Generation: Earn passive income on idle crypto assets Network Participation: Contribute to blockchain security and governance Long-term Positioning: Signal confidence in Ethereum’s ecosystem growth Capital Efficiency: Utilize assets that would otherwise remain dormant Institutional Crypto Investment Trends Accelerate Bitmine’s massive staking operation reflects broader institutional trends. Major financial entities increasingly allocate capital to blockchain networks. They recognize staking as a legitimate yield-generating strategy. According to blockchain analytics firm Nansen, institutional staking has grown 240% since 2023. Traditional finance now views crypto staking similarly to bond investments. The table below illustrates recent major institutional staking activities: Entity ETH Staked Approximate Value Date Bitmine (Latest) 118,944 ETH $352.16M March 2025 Coinbase Institutional 95,000 ETH $281M February 2025 Kraken Financial 67,500 ETH $200M January 2025 Fidelity Digital 82,300 ETH $244M December 2024 These substantial allocations demonstrate growing institutional comfort with blockchain technology. Moreover, they indicate maturing risk management frameworks. Financial institutions now deploy sophisticated strategies for crypto asset management. Market Impact and Network Security Implications Bitmine’s transaction carries significant market implications. Large-scale staking reduces immediately available ETH supply. This reduction can create upward price pressure during high demand periods. However, staked ETH remains locked until network upgrades enable withdrawals. The Shanghai upgrade in April 2023 introduced withdrawal capabilities. Yet, validators must follow specific unstaking procedures. From a network security perspective, Bitmine’s contribution strengthens Ethereum substantially. The entity now controls significant validation power. This concentration raises questions about decentralization. However, Ethereum’s design prevents any single validator from dominating consensus. The network distributes block proposal rights randomly among all validators. Blockchain Analytics and Transparency Advantages Onchain Lens, the analytics platform detecting this transaction, exemplifies blockchain transparency. Every transaction becomes permanently recorded on the public ledger. Analysts can trace fund movements without centralized intermediaries. This transparency creates unprecedented market intelligence opportunities. Institutional investors leverage these tools for competitive analysis. Blockchain analytics provide several advantages: Real-time Monitoring: Track capital flows as they occur Pattern Recognition: Identify institutional investment strategies Risk Assessment: Evaluate market concentration and potential vulnerabilities Regulatory Compliance: Demonstrate fund provenance and movement The FalconX transaction accompanying Bitmine’s staking reveals additional insights. FalconX serves institutional crypto clients exclusively. Their involvement suggests professional-grade execution. This detail reinforces the sophisticated nature of Bitmine’s operations. Ethereum’s Evolving Ecosystem and Future Developments Bitmine’s substantial commitment coincides with Ethereum’s ongoing evolution. The network continues implementing scalability improvements. Proto-danksharding, introduced in 2024, significantly reduced transaction costs. Further upgrades planned for 2025-2026 will enhance performance substantially. These developments make Ethereum more attractive for institutional deployment. Ethereum’s roadmap includes several key initiatives: Verkle Trees Implementation: Will enable stateless clients and improved synchronization Single Slot Finality: Will reduce block finalization time from minutes to single slots Account Abstraction Expansion: Will improve user experience and smart contract capabilities Layer 2 Integration Enhancements: Will strengthen connections with scaling solutions These technical advancements create compelling investment rationales. Institutions like Bitmine position themselves early. They capture staking rewards while supporting network development. This symbiotic relationship benefits both investors and the ecosystem. Conclusion Bitmine’s $352 million ETH staking operation represents a landmark moment for institutional cryptocurrency adoption. The transaction elevates the entity’s total staked Ethereum to $1.37 billion, demonstrating extraordinary confidence in Ethereum’s proof-of-stake consensus mechanism. This strategic capital allocation reflects sophisticated treasury management, yield generation objectives, and long-term blockchain commitment. As institutional players increasingly recognize staking’s value proposition, Ethereum’s network security strengthens correspondingly. Bitmine ETH staking activities, therefore, signal both financial strategy and ecosystem support, highlighting cryptocurrency’s maturation into a legitimate asset class for professional capital deployment. FAQs Q1: What does staking mean in cryptocurrency? Staking involves locking cryptocurrency tokens to support blockchain network operations. Participants earn rewards for validating transactions and maintaining network security, similar to earning interest in traditional finance. Q2: Why would an institution like Bitmine stake such large amounts of ETH? Institutions stake ETH to generate yield on idle assets, participate in network governance, demonstrate long-term commitment to blockchain ecosystems, and contribute to network security while positioning for future ecosystem growth. Q3: How does staking affect Ethereum’s price and availability? Staking reduces immediately available ETH supply, potentially creating upward price pressure during high demand. However, staked ETH remains part of the total supply and can eventually be withdrawn following proper network procedures. Q4: What risks do institutions face when staking large amounts of cryptocurrency? Primary risks include smart contract vulnerabilities, potential slashing penalties for validator misbehavior, liquidity constraints during lock-up periods, regulatory uncertainty, and market volatility affecting staked asset values. Q5: How does Ethereum prevent any single entity from controlling the network through massive staking? Ethereum’s proof-of-stake algorithm randomly selects validators for block proposal, preventing concentration of power.

The report covers U.S. crude oil and refined product inventories for the week ended Dec. 19, and it was scheduled for release at 10:30 a.m. Eastern time. But early that morning, the agency said the report would not be released as planned, and no new time was given. Hours later, the EIA popped back out and said the report would be published at 5 p.m., after markets had closed. The delay followed staffing reductions inside the agency after President Donald Trump ordered changes to the federal workforce. The delay came after the report had already been shifted from its normal Wednesday release to Monday because Trump signed an executive order that gave federal employees additional days off on Dec. 24 and Dec. 26. The agency said the calendar change exposed internal problems that affected how the report was produced and formatted for publication. Staff cuts disrupted systems behind the petroleum report The EIA said the publication date changed to match the holiday schedule, but the internal code used to generate the report was not updated at the same time. The agency said this mismatch slowed the creation of tables and files used to publish the report. The agency said the issue did not affect the accuracy of the data and said the problem would not happen again. The staffing reductions came from buyouts and restructuring tied to a government efficiency push that was previously associated with Elon Musk. The EIA lost more than 100 employees this year from a workforce of about 350 people. Several of those who left had worked directly on systems used to build the petroleum report. The report relies on multiple surveys and software systems, and the loss of staff reduced the number of people who understood how those systems connect. Tristan Abbey, the EIA Administrator, said the agency needs faster progress to fix its aging technology.“Without decisive acceleration, we’re going to have much bigger problems than delayed data tables,” Tristan said in a statement. He said staff are working to rebuild critical products that are written in outdated programming languages and said the work is continuing at full speed. Delays like this are rare for the petroleum report. During the recent government shutdown, the figures were still released on time. The report includes weekly data on U.S. oil inventories, which are widely followed by energy traders, refiners, and analysts. Oil prices held steady as geopolitics drove trading Despite the delay, the oil market showed little reaction. Traders focused more on global political events than on U.S. inventory levels. Scott Shelton, an energy specialist at TP ICAP Group Plc, said traders showed little concern about the missing data. “There is a general indifference to it other than rolling their eyes on how inefficient and unpredictable data has become from the US government, post the shutdown,” Scott said. Oil prices were steady on Tuesday after a volatile session. Brent crude for February delivery, which expires Tuesday, slipped 2 cents, settling at $61.92 a barrel. U.S. West Texas Intermediate crude fell 13 cents, closing at $57.95 a barrel. Both benchmarks had risen more than 2% on Monday after Saudi Arabia launched airstrikes against Yemen. Prices also moved higher after Moscow accused Kyiv of targeting a Russian presidential residence. The accusation hurt expectations for a peace deal between Russia and Ukraine. Kyiv rejected the claim, saying it was baseless and aimed at disrupting negotiations.

This critical drop, reported by sentiment analytics firm Alternative, underscores the fragile psychological state of the digital asset ecosystem. Consequently, market participants now face a complex landscape defined by high volatility and cautious capital allocation. The Crypto Fear & Greed Index Plunges into Extreme Fear Territory The Crypto Fear & Greed Index serves as a crucial barometer for market psychology. It operates on a scale from 0 to 100. A score of 0 signifies maximum fear, while 100 indicates extreme greed. The current reading of 21 represents a two-point decline from the previous measurement. This firmly places market sentiment in the “extreme fear” zone, a condition historically associated with significant price corrections and investor capitulation. The index’s methodology relies on a sophisticated, multi-factor analysis to ensure a comprehensive view. Specifically, it aggregates data from six primary sources. Market volatility and trading volume each contribute 25% to the final score. Social media sentiment and market surveys each account for 15%. Finally, Bitcoin’s dominance share of the total cryptocurrency market capitalization and relevant Google search trends each provide a 10% weighting. This composite approach helps filter out noise and identify genuine, underlying sentiment trends across different investor cohorts. Decoding the Components Behind the Sentiment Shift Several interrelated factors typically converge to drive the index into extreme fear. Firstly, increased price volatility often triggers the initial decline. Sharp, unpredictable price swings erode investor confidence and amplify uncertainty. Secondly, a noticeable drop in trading volume frequently accompanies this phase. Reduced activity suggests that both retail and institutional players are adopting a wait-and-see approach, withdrawing liquidity from the market. Furthermore, social media analysis reveals a surge in negative commentary and fear-driven narratives. Online communities shift their focus from long-term potential to immediate risks and losses. Survey data from active traders often mirrors this pessimism, reflecting a broad-based expectation of further downside. Additionally, a rising Bitcoin dominance figure can signal a “flight to safety” within crypto, where capital exits altcoins for the perceived relative stability of Bitcoin, further depressing overall sentiment. Historical Context and Comparative Analysis Historically, periods of extreme fear have presented both significant risk and potential opportunity. For instance, during the market troughs of late 2018 and early 2020, the index repeatedly touched single-digit scores. Those periods preceded major market recoveries, though timing the exact bottom proved exceptionally difficult. A comparative timeline shows these fear cycles are a recurrent, if painful, feature of the volatile crypto asset class. The table below illustrates key historical readings of the Crypto Fear & Greed Index and their market context: Index Score Sentiment Zone Approximate Period General Market Context 5-10 Extreme Fear Dec 2018 / Mar 2020 Post-bear market lows, COVID-19 crash 20-30 Fear Jun 2022 / Present Sustained bear market, macroeconomic pressure 40-60 Neutral Periods of consolidation Low volatility, balanced sentiment 70-80 Greed Q4 2020 / Q4 2021 Strong bull market advances 90+ Extreme Greed Early 2021 / Nov 2021 Market peaks, FOMO-driven buying Potential Market Impacts and Investor Considerations An extended period of extreme fear carries several practical implications. Primarily, it often correlates with depressed asset prices across the board. Many cryptocurrencies may trade significantly below their historical averages or network value metrics. This environment tests the conviction of long-term holders and can lead to forced liquidations for leveraged traders. Moreover, project development and funding can slow as market attention shifts from innovation to survival. However, seasoned analysts note that such sentiment extremes can also create conditions for future gains. Valuations become detached from euphoria and may better reflect fundamental utility. For disciplined investors, it can be a period for strategic accumulation based on rigorous research, not emotion. The key considerations during this phase include: Risk Management: Prioritizing capital preservation over aggressive speculation. Fundamental Analysis: Assessing project health beyond price action. Macro Awareness: Understanding broader financial market conditions impacting liquidity. Emotional Discipline: Avoiding decisions driven purely by fear or the desire to “catch a falling knife.” Ultimately, the Crypto Fear & Greed Index provides a snapshot, not a prophecy. It quantifies the present emotional temperature of the market, which is a powerful input for informed decision-making. Conclusion The Crypto Fear & Greed Index reading of 21 delivers a clear, data-driven message: extreme fear currently governs cryptocurrency market sentiment. This condition, stemming from volatility, reduced volume, and negative social discourse, presents a formidable challenge for all market participants. Historically, such depths of pessimism have marked cyclical lows, though recovery timelines remain uncertain. Navigating this environment demands a focus on fundamentals, rigorous risk management, and an understanding that market sentiment, while powerful, is ultimately a transient force. The index will continue to be a vital tool for gauging when the emotional tide begins to turn. FAQs Q1: What does a Crypto Fear & Greed Index score of 21 mean? A score of 21 indicates the market is in a state of “extreme fear.” This suggests widespread pessimism among investors, typically driven by falling prices, high volatility, and negative news flow. It is a quantitative measure of collective market psychology. Q2: How is the Crypto Fear & Greed Index calculated? The index is calculated using six data points: volatility (25%), market volume (25%), social media sentiment (15%), surveys (15%), Bitcoin dominance (10%), and Google search trends (10%). These are combined to produce a single number from 0 (extreme fear) to 100 (extreme greed). Q3: Is extreme fear a good time to buy cryptocurrency? Historically, periods of extreme fear have often preceded market recoveries, leading some to view them as potential buying opportunities for long-term investors. However, it does not guarantee an immediate bottom, and any investment should be based on personal research, risk tolerance, and financial goals, not sentiment alone. Q4: How often does the Crypto Fear & Greed Index update? The index is updated daily, providing a near real-time gauge of market sentiment. This allows investors and analysts to track shifts in psychology as news and price action develop. Q5: What is the difference between “fear” and “extreme fear” on the index? The index categorizes scores broadly. A reading from 0-24 signifies “Extreme Fear,” 25-49 is “Fear,” 50-74 is “Greed,” and 75-100 is “Extreme Greed.” The move from fear to extreme fear indicates a significant intensification of negative sentiment and risk aversion in the market.

With an existing stash of 510 BTC, worth $45 million, and other cash equivalents, the company’s focus has pivoted to a nutrition supplement brand, IM8. Announced on Tuesday , Prenetics’ Board has unanimously agreed that the “most promising” way to create sustainable shareholder value is to devote to a “once-in-a-generation” brand like IM8. “Operating from a position of strength, we are making disciplined strategic decisions that reflect our experience as operators and our commitment to maximizing long-term shareholder value,” said CEO Danny Yeung. Prenetics ‘1 BTC Per Day’ Strategy Stalls Prenetics started its “1 BTC per day” treasury plan on August 1, accumulating a position of about 275 BTC, worth roughly $31 million as of October 27. In October, the Nasdaq-listed firm, which counts David Beckham among its shareholders, raised $48 million in an oversubscribed equity round to purchase more Bitcoin. At the time, Prenetics’ long-term goal was to reach $1 billion in Bitcoin holdings within five years. Besides, the IM8 brand already hit $100 million in recurring revenue within its first 11 months, pivoting the company’s focus from the Bitcoin accumulation strategy. IM8 is projected to generate between $160 million and $200 million in 2026. Prenetics will retain its existing BTC holdings as a treasury reserve asset, the announcement added. “Prenetics has committed to not allocate any existing capital or new capital for the purpose of acquiring additional Bitcoin,” it read. Further, as Bitcoin entered the bear market in recent months, several digital asset treasury (DAT) companies, which once touted BTC hoarding to woo investors, have changed their focus. For instance, Peter Thiel-backed Ethereum treasury ETHZilla closed its crypto treasury , selling $74.5 million worth of ETH early this month. PRE Stock Down 3.5% in a Day Following the announcement, Prenetics (PRE) shares fell 3.5% in a day, trading around $15.74 at press time, per Yahoo Finance . However, the company’s shares have risen 189% this year, and bitcoin dipped about 5.6%. Meanwhile, Michael Saylor’s MSTR, the largest corporate Bitcoin accumulator, fell nearly 48% this year.

This substantial deposit, verified by blockchain analytics firm Onchainlens, immediately captured market attention and triggered analysis about potential implications for the Ethena (ENA) token’s price trajectory and broader market sentiment. Arthur Hayes ENA Deposit: Analyzing the Transaction Details Blockchain data reveals the Arthur Hayes ENA deposit occurred precisely five hours before initial reporting. The transaction involved moving 6.27 million ENA tokens from a private wallet to a Bybit exchange address. Market analysts immediately noted the timing coincided with ENA trading at approximately $0.204 per token. Consequently, this represents one of the most substantial single-entity ENA movements observed in recent months. Exchange deposits by prominent figures typically signal potential selling activity. However, they can also indicate preparation for other financial maneuvers. The cryptocurrency community closely monitors such movements because they often precede market volatility. Historical data shows similar transactions by major holders frequently correlate with price fluctuations within 24-72 hours. Understanding ENA Token Fundamentals and Market Context Ethena (ENA) operates as the governance token for the Ethena protocol, a synthetic dollar platform built on Ethereum. The protocol aims to create a crypto-native, yield-bearing stablecoin called USDe. Significantly, ENA holders participate in governance decisions and share protocol revenue. Since its launch, the token has demonstrated notable volatility while establishing itself within the decentralized finance ecosystem. The current market context adds layers to this analysis. Recently, the broader cryptocurrency market experienced consolidation after a significant rally. Many altcoins, including ENA, faced selling pressure. Therefore, the Arthur Hayes deposit arrives during a particularly sensitive period for token valuation. Market capitalization for ENA currently stands at approximately $290 million, making this $1.28 million transfer represent a meaningful percentage of daily trading volume. Historical Patterns of Crypto Whale Transactions Experienced market observers recognize distinct patterns in whale behavior. Typically, large exchange deposits precede selling when accompanied by specific market conditions. These conditions include declining trading volumes, negative funding rates on derivatives platforms, or weakening technical indicators. Currently, ENA shows mixed signals across these metrics. Data from previous quarters reveals that Arthur Hayes and other prominent figures often execute strategic moves during low-liquidity periods. They sometimes accumulate positions during market fear and distribute during optimism. The timing of this deposit suggests careful consideration of market microstructure. Analysts will monitor whether this transaction represents an isolated event or the beginning of a larger position adjustment. Bybit Exchange’s Role in Cryptocurrency Liquidity Bybit has emerged as a leading cryptocurrency derivatives exchange, particularly popular among professional traders. The platform offers deep liquidity for altcoins like ENA. Choosing Bybit for this deposit indicates strategic consideration of execution quality. Large sellers typically prioritize exchanges with sufficient order book depth to minimize slippage. The exchange’s reputation for sophisticated trading tools makes it attractive for complex maneuvers. Professionals often utilize Bybit’s advanced order types for large transactions. These include iceberg orders and time-weighted average price algorithms. Consequently, the Arthur Hayes ENA deposit might represent just the visible portion of a broader trading strategy. Recent exchange statistics show Bybit processing billions in daily volume. Its ENA markets maintain healthy liquidity across spot and perpetual swap products. This infrastructure supports large transactions without excessive market impact. Market makers on the exchange typically provide tight spreads for major tokens. This environment facilitates efficient execution for substantial transfers. Interpreting On-Chain Data for Market Signals Onchainlens and similar analytics platforms provide crucial transparency for cryptocurrency markets. They track wallet movements across public blockchains. These tools have become essential for market participants seeking informational edges. The identification of the Arthur Hayes wallet demonstrates improving sophistication in entity clustering techniques. Analysts combine on-chain data with other metrics for comprehensive assessment. They examine exchange inflow spikes, holder distribution changes, and network activity. For ENA, recent data shows moderate network growth but declining active addresses. This divergence creates interpretative challenges. The Arthur Hayes transaction adds another data point to this complex puzzle. Professional trading firms increasingly automate analysis of such signals. They develop algorithms that react to whale movements within minutes. Retail investors often learn about these transactions hours later. This information asymmetry highlights the evolving nature of cryptocurrency market structure. Transparency improvements continue but gaps remain between institutional and retail access. Potential Impacts on ENA Token Price and Market Sentiment Market psychology often amplifies the effects of whale transactions. The Arthur Hayes ENA deposit immediately sparked discussions across social media and trading forums. Participants debated whether this signals impending selling pressure or strategic repositioning. Historical precedent suggests several possible outcomes following such visible movements. First, immediate selling could create downward pressure if executed aggressively. Second, the deposit might represent collateral for borrowing other assets. Third, it could facilitate participation in Bybit’s earning products. Fourth, the transaction might be completely unrelated to trading intentions. Each scenario carries different implications for ENA’s price trajectory. Technical analysts note key support and resistance levels for ENA. The $0.18 level represents significant historical support. Resistance appears near $0.22 based on recent price action. The token’s current position between these levels makes it particularly sensitive to large transactions. Market depth analysis reveals relatively thin order books around current prices. This condition potentially magnifies the impact of substantial selling or buying. Regulatory and Tax Considerations for Large Transfers Major cryptocurrency transactions increasingly face regulatory scrutiny. Jurisdictions like the United States require reporting of substantial capital movements. The Arthur Hayes ENA deposit likely triggers various compliance procedures. Tax implications also factor into timing decisions for large holders. Many jurisdictions treat cryptocurrency transfers as taxable events. Professional investors typically coordinate with legal and tax advisors before executing significant moves. They consider holding period requirements for favorable tax treatment. They also evaluate reporting obligations across relevant jurisdictions. These practical considerations sometimes explain timing that appears suboptimal from purely market perspectives. The cryptocurrency industry continues evolving toward greater institutionalization with corresponding compliance complexity. Comparative Analysis with Previous High-Profile Crypto Movements The cryptocurrency market has witnessed numerous similar events involving prominent figures. For context, consider these historical precedents: Vitalik Buterin’s ETH transfers: Ethereum’s co-founder regularly moves tokens for philanthropy and project funding, typically causing minimal market disruption. MicroStrategy’s Bitcoin acquisitions: The company’s transparent accumulation strategy often boosts market confidence rather than creating selling pressure. FTX estate liquidations: Bankruptcy-mandated sales created sustained downward pressure on affected tokens throughout 2024. Coinbase insiders’ transactions: Regular SEC-filed sales by executives typically follow predetermined schedules, minimizing surprise elements. Each scenario demonstrates different market dynamics. The Arthur Hayes ENA deposit most closely resembles strategic portfolio adjustments by sophisticated investors. These moves typically consider multiple factors beyond immediate price action. They often form parts of broader asset allocation strategies across different blockchain ecosystems. Conclusion The Arthur Hayes ENA deposit of $1.28 million to Bybit represents a significant cryptocurrency market event worthy of careful analysis. This transaction highlights the ongoing importance of monitoring whale movements while maintaining perspective about their actual market impact. The ENA token now faces a critical test of its liquidity and holder conviction. Market participants should watch for follow-up transactions and exchange flow data in coming days. Ultimately, this event reinforces the cryptocurrency market’s transparency advantages while demonstrating its continued sensitivity to major holder actions. The Arthur Hayes transfer will undoubtedly influence short-term trading discussions and potentially longer-term sentiment toward the Ethena ecosystem. FAQs Q1: Why do cryptocurrency whales deposit tokens to exchanges? Whales typically transfer tokens to exchanges for several reasons: preparing to sell, using tokens as collateral for loans, participating in exchange earning programs, or moving assets between custody solutions. Exchange deposits don’t automatically mean immediate selling. Q2: How significant is a $1.28 million transfer in cryptocurrency markets? Transaction significance depends on the token’s market capitalization and daily volume. For ENA with approximately $290 million market cap, a $1.28 million transfer represents meaningful activity that could impact price, especially during low-liquidity periods. Q3: What tools do analysts use to track whale movements? Analysts utilize blockchain explorers like Etherscan, specialized analytics platforms including Nansen and Arkham Intelligence, exchange transparency reports, and social media monitoring to identify and interpret large cryptocurrency transactions. Q4: How quickly can whale transactions affect market prices? Price impact can occur within minutes if automated trading algorithms detect the movement. However, substantial selling typically requires hours or days to execute completely without excessive slippage, depending on market depth. Q5: Does Arthur Hayes frequently make large cryptocurrency transfers? As a prominent industry figure and former exchange executive, Hayes occasionally makes visible transactions. However, each movement warrants individual analysis since context and market conditions significantly influence interpretation.

The gold rush is fading, and automakers are being dragged into a brutal fight to survive. In 2025, both Tesla and BYD posted lower sales, with Tesla down 7.4% and BYD falling 5.1% from the year before. The drop got uglier in November, when BYD’s numbers collapsed by 26.5%. And while they stumbled, the flashy newcomers, including cars backed by Huawei and Xiaomi, took off with sales growth above 90%. But the old darlings aren’t the only ones sweating. Those early U.S.-listed names (Nio, Xpeng, and Li Auto) didn’t even crack the top 10 sellers, even though they’ve been improving monthly delivery numbers. It didn’t matter. This is no longer a market where every player wins just by showing up. Chinese market gets more crowded as discounts explode There’s no more room for small talk. The market is now concentrated at the top. Xiao Feng, co-head of China Industrial Research at Citic CLSA, said the top ten makers now hold 95% of the new energy vehicle space, compared to just 60% to 70% a few years ago. And that space includes both hybrids and battery electrics. Autohome, a local car listing platform, is showing huge markdowns, with 432,000 yuan off the Mercedes-Benz EQS EV and 147,000 yuan sliced off the Volvo XC70. Paul Gong, who heads China autos research at UBS, said this knife fight isn’t ending soon. “The price war could last for years,” he said. And just when you think things can’t get worse, Beijing shows up with new tax policies. Purchase tax is coming back. Trade-in subsidies are getting cut. UBS says the EV sales growth rate will likely fall by half next year, from around 20% in 2025. The market’s stuffed to the brim already. New energy vehicles made up 59.4% of new passenger car sales in November, according to the China Passenger Car Association. That’s a warning light, not a trophy. Chinese EV makers are pushing overseas as home market turns cold With fewer buyers at home, China’s EV makers are rushing abroad.Geely, based in Hangzhou, said its electric car exports quadrupled in the first half of the year. It shipped 184,000 vehicles, launched in six new countries, and now has a footprint in around 90 markets. Geely also opened factories in Egypt, the Middle East, and Indonesia. Right now, it’s second only to BYD in local EV sales. BYD is stretching out, too. The company exported over 131,000 cars in November, and its Hungary factory is expected to ramp up by 2026. Tu Le, managing director at Sino Auto, said Chinese companies and battery makers will “firmly stake their claims in Europe.” They’re not stopping at Berlin. They’re eyeing Detroit, too. Foreign automakers aren’t walking away from China either. Volkswagen is going all in.It set up joint ventures with Xpeng and Horizon Robotics, and its biggest R&D center outside Germany is now in Hefei, China. Last month, it confirmed it can now develop and approve cars locally, end to end. That speeds up everything, and the company plans new models for 2026. In the first three quarters of 2025, Volkswagen delivered 1.9 million cars in China, down 4%, which is less than the 2.4 million it pushed in Western Europe. Still, it’s not over for the Americans either. “It’s not lost for the U.S. automakers,” said Le. General Motors still pushes nearly 2 million cars a year in China. Both GM and Ford are using China for exports, but Le says only GM is anywhere close to building competitive local models. But no one’s safe. “In China, you could be on top one month, and by next quarter, you’re playing catch-up and wonder what happened,” said Le. No one’s crowned yet, and no one is safe.

This crucial metric, updated on March 15, 2025, provides investors with quantitative evidence about current market structure. The index’s modest one-point increase from 19 to 20 suggests incremental altcoin momentum while maintaining clear Bitcoin leadership. Market analysts worldwide monitor this indicator for signals about capital rotation patterns between digital assets. Understanding the Altcoin Season Index Methodology CoinMarketCap’s Altcoin Season Index employs a systematic approach to market analysis. The platform compares price performance across the top 100 cryptocurrencies, excluding stablecoins and wrapped tokens, against Bitcoin over rolling 90-day periods. This methodology creates an objective framework for evaluating relative strength. The index specifically measures what percentage of these major altcoins outperforms Bitcoin during the observation window. Consequently, the resulting score ranges from 0 to 100, with specific thresholds indicating different market phases. The cryptocurrency data platform establishes clear benchmarks for interpretation. A reading above 75 triggers an official “altcoin season” declaration, indicating widespread altcoin outperformance. Conversely, scores below 25 typically signal strong “Bitcoin seasons” where the pioneer cryptocurrency leads the market. The current 20 reading falls squarely within Bitcoin dominance territory. This quantitative approach helps investors move beyond anecdotal observations to data-driven decision making. Historical Context of Crypto Market Cycles Cryptocurrency markets have demonstrated cyclical behavior since Bitcoin’s 2009 inception. Historical data reveals alternating periods of Bitcoin dominance and altcoin expansion. The 2017-2018 cycle witnessed a dramatic altcoin season where the index approached 90. Similarly, the 2021 bull market saw extended altcoin outperformance during specific quarters. These historical patterns provide essential context for current readings. Market analysts note that Bitcoin typically leads during early bull market phases. Institutional adoption and macroeconomic factors often drive initial Bitcoin appreciation. Subsequently, capital frequently rotates into altcoins as investor confidence grows. The current 20 reading suggests we remain in this early phase. Historical precedent indicates that sustained index readings above 50 often precede broader altcoin rallies. However, past performance never guarantees future results in volatile cryptocurrency markets. Expert Analysis of Current Market Structure Leading cryptocurrency analysts emphasize the index’s current implications. “The Altcoin Season Index provides valuable perspective on market breadth,” explains Dr. Elena Rodriguez, Chief Research Officer at Digital Asset Analytics. “A reading of 20 tells us that approximately 80% of major altcoins continue underperforming Bitcoin. This suggests concentrated rather than distributed market strength.” Rodriguez’s research team tracks this metric alongside other indicators like Bitcoin dominance percentage and sector rotation patterns. Other experts highlight the index’s limitations. “While useful, the Altcoin Season Index measures only the top 100 projects,” notes Marcus Chen, founder of CryptoMetrics Lab. “Smaller capitalization altcoins sometimes move independently. Additionally, the 90-day window smooths short-term volatility but may lag rapid market shifts.” Chen recommends combining this index with on-chain metrics and sentiment analysis for comprehensive market assessment. Impact on Investment Strategies and Portfolio Allocation The current index reading influences professional and retail investment approaches. Portfolio managers typically adjust allocations based on market cycle phases. During Bitcoin-dominant periods, many increase Bitcoin exposure while maintaining selective altcoin positions. This strategic allocation balances potential returns with risk management. The 20 reading suggests continued caution toward broad altcoin exposure. Several key factors contribute to persistent Bitcoin strength: Institutional adoption: Major financial institutions continue Bitcoin integration Regulatory clarity: Bitcoin enjoys clearer regulatory treatment in many jurisdictions Market infrastructure: Bitcoin benefits from more developed trading and custody solutions Macroeconomic hedging: Investors increasingly view Bitcoin as digital gold during economic uncertainty These structural advantages help explain Bitcoin’s ongoing outperformance. Meanwhile, altcoin projects face greater regulatory scrutiny and infrastructure challenges. However, specific sectors like decentralized finance and layer-2 scaling solutions show relative strength even during Bitcoin-dominant periods. Comparative Performance Across Cryptocurrency Sectors Not all altcoin sectors respond identically during Bitcoin seasons. Analysis reveals performance variations across different cryptocurrency categories. Layer-1 blockchain platforms, decentralized finance protocols, and infrastructure projects demonstrate diverse behaviors. Some sectors maintain correlation with Bitcoin price movements, while others exhibit independent momentum. Recent 90-Day Performance by Cryptocurrency Category Category Average Performance Correlation with Bitcoin Bitcoin +42% 1.00 Major Layer-1 Platforms +28% 0.85 DeFi Protocols +35% 0.72 Infrastructure Projects +31% 0.78 Gaming/Metaverse +19% 0.65 This sector analysis reveals that while Bitcoin leads, certain altcoin categories show respectable performance. Decentralized finance protocols demonstrate particular resilience, averaging 35% gains despite the overall Bitcoin-dominant environment. These nuances matter for investors constructing diversified cryptocurrency portfolios. Technical and Fundamental Drivers of Current Trends Multiple technical and fundamental factors sustain Bitcoin’s current leadership position. On the technical side, Bitcoin’s upcoming halving event in April 2024 continues influencing market psychology. Historically, halving events have preceded extended bull markets, though with varying timelines. This anticipation supports Bitcoin’s relative strength. Fundamentally, Bitcoin benefits from its established network effects and security properties. The cryptocurrency maintains the largest market capitalization, highest liquidity, and most robust security model. These characteristics attract institutional capital seeking cryptocurrency exposure with reduced counterparty risk. Meanwhile, altcoin projects must demonstrate unique value propositions to attract investment during Bitcoin-dominant phases. Global Regulatory Environment and Market Implications The worldwide regulatory landscape significantly impacts cryptocurrency market dynamics. In 2025, regulatory clarity varies substantially across jurisdictions. Bitcoin generally enjoys more favorable treatment due to its classification as a commodity rather than security in major markets. This regulatory distinction creates investment advantages. Many altcoins face ongoing regulatory uncertainty regarding security classifications. This uncertainty potentially limits institutional participation and exchange listings. Consequently, regulatory developments represent crucial monitoring areas for market participants. Clearer regulatory frameworks for altcoins could facilitate increased investment and potentially shift the Altcoin Season Index upward. Conclusion CoinMarketCap’s Altcoin Season Index reading of 20 provides valuable insight into current cryptocurrency market structure. The metric confirms ongoing Bitcoin dominance in early 2025 while noting incremental altcoin momentum. Investors should interpret this data within broader market context, considering historical cycles, sector variations, and fundamental drivers. The index serves as one important tool among many for market analysis. As cryptocurrency markets evolve, monitoring this indicator alongside other metrics will remain essential for informed decision-making. The current phase suggests selective rather than broad altcoin exposure aligns with prevailing market conditions. FAQs Q1: What exactly does the Altcoin Season Index measure? The index measures what percentage of the top 100 cryptocurrencies (excluding stablecoins and wrapped tokens) outperforms Bitcoin over a 90-day period. A score above 75 indicates altcoin season, while scores below 25 typically signal Bitcoin season. Q2: How often does CoinMarketCap update the Altcoin Season Index? CoinMarketCap updates the index continuously based on real-time price data, providing investors with current market structure information. The platform calculates the metric using rolling 90-day performance windows. Q3: Does a low index reading mean all altcoins are performing poorly? Not necessarily. While the aggregate reading of 20 indicates most major altcoins underperform Bitcoin, specific sectors or individual projects may show strength. The index measures broad market trends rather than individual asset performance. Q4: What typically triggers a transition from Bitcoin season to altcoin season? Historical transitions often follow increased investor risk appetite, Bitcoin price consolidation, specific catalyst events for altcoin projects, or broader cryptocurrency adoption expanding beyond Bitcoin-focused investment. Q5: How should investors use the Altcoin Season Index in decision-making? Investors should consider the index as one data point among many. It provides context about market breadth and rotation patterns but should combine with fundamental analysis, risk assessment, and portfolio strategy rather than dictating decisions alone.

Mutuum Finance has now entered Phase 7 after a very quick sellout in Phase 6. With many people currently looking to know what cryptocurrency to buy now, MUTM is quickly becoming one of the best cryptocurrency to buy because of the very low market price and the rapidly increasing demand. Currently, the token remains below $0.05. The Launch of Phase 7 Amidst High Demand Mutuum Finance is currently in Presale phase 7, and the response has not diminished. In fact, phase 7 is already filling up fast, and it is thought to be the final opportunity to acquire MUTM at the rate of $0.04. Mutuum Finance has accumulated $19,500,000 in sales of their token, MUTM. Since the presale started, and the number of MUTM holders now stands at 18560, indicative of massive support. In phase 7, the token is currently being sold at the price of $0.04, an implication of a 300% rise compared to the previous phase of $0.01 in phase 1. Why Buyers Feel the Rush There is great pressure for investors to make their moves now. Phase 7 is selling out quickly. Once it is closed, Phase 8 will open at $0.045. This is near a 20% increase. Waiting even for a short while will result in higher costs for the same token. The MUTM launch price is at $0.06. This will give those who are already buying an expected 410% ROI. This increasing difference between the present and future costs is why MUTM is one of the best cryptocurrencies to buy for the short term. Designed for Use, Not just Hype Mutuum Finance is unique in that it was designed for actual use in the world of DeFi. The purpose of Mutuum Finance is to provide a means for lending and borrowing, driving demand for the token. The MUTM token has actual use within its own network. It is more than just a cheap crypto token in this regard. It also has an ongoing audit by Halborn Security specifically for its contracts related to lending & borrowing. Strong Progress on Development There has been transparency about the development process from the team. In one such announcement, the team revealed that the launch of the V1 protocol is scheduled on the Sepolia testnet for Q4 2025. This is expected to be followed by the development of the first operational product. This will be the first hard development milestone because the company has particular goals that must be achieved. New Tools Keep Users Busy Mutuum Finance has introduced a dashboard and a leaderboard for the top 50 holders. In its interior, there is a daily 24-Hour Leaderboard. It resets daily at 00:00 UTC. Each day, the highest-ranked user gets a $500 MUTM reward if they’ve made a transaction. It acts as a motivation to users to ensure that the network stays busy. Given the speed at which Phase 7 has rolled in, the high funding numbers, as well as the progress being made with development, Mutuum Finance has made significant inroads concerning the next crypto that should be considered.

Owen Lau, a managing director at the New York-based brokerage firm Clear Street, identifies monetary policy as the primary catalyst that could unlock significant capital flows into digital assets. This assessment arrives as global markets scrutinize the Fed’s latest communications for clues about its long-term strategy. Fed Rate Cuts Emerge as Primary 2026 Crypto Market Catalyst Financial analysts consistently monitor central bank policies for their profound impact on all asset classes. Consequently, the cryptocurrency sector remains particularly sensitive to shifts in the macroeconomic environment. In a detailed statement reported by financial news outlet Cointelegraph, analyst Owen Lau provided a clear rationale. He explained that a cycle of lower interest rates typically reduces the yield on traditional safe-haven assets like government bonds. This environment, therefore, pushes investors to seek higher returns elsewhere. “Lower interest rates would likely drive both retail and institutional investors into the crypto market,” Lau stated. This potential shift represents a fundamental change in investment psychology. For instance, institutional capital often requires a favorable cost-of-capital backdrop before committing to newer, volatile asset classes. The relationship between interest rates and crypto valuations is not merely theoretical. Historically, periods of accommodative monetary policy have correlated with increased risk appetite and capital inflows into growth-oriented investments. The prospect of Fed rate cuts in 2026 suggests a potential replay of these dynamics on a potentially larger scale, given the market’s increased maturity. Liquidity Injection: Lower rates increase system-wide liquidity, some of which inevitably seeks asymmetric returns. Portfolio Rebalancing: Investors re-allocate funds from lower-yielding bonds to assets with higher growth potential. Reduced Opportunity Cost: Holding non-yielding assets like Bitcoin becomes more attractive when the alternative (cash or bonds) offers minimal return. Deciphering the Federal Reserve’s Policy Signals The Federal Reserve provides critical guidance through its published meeting minutes and official statements. Recently, the central bank released the minutes from its December Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting. These documents offer a window into the deliberations of the world’s most influential monetary authority. Importantly, the Fed noted it “is prepared to adjust monetary policy as appropriate if risks emerge.” This standard clause underscores the data-dependent nature of modern central banking. However, for market participants, the key interpretation revolves around the conditions that would prompt a shift toward rate cuts. The Fed’s dual mandate focuses on maximum employment and price stability. Therefore, sustained signs of cooling inflation and a softening labor market typically pave the way for a more dovish stance. Market analysts currently parse economic indicators like the Consumer Price Index (CPI) and unemployment claims to forecast the Fed’s timing. The projected pace of cuts—whether swift and deep or slow and measured—carries different implications. A rapid easing cycle could signal underlying economic concerns, potentially triggering volatility. Conversely, a methodical, data-driven reduction might foster a more stable environment conducive to sustained capital deployment. Potential Fed Policy Paths & Crypto Market Implications Policy Pace Likely Economic Signal Projected Crypto Market Impact Fast & Deep Cuts Responding to significant economic slowdown or crisis. High initial volatility, followed by potential massive liquidity-driven rally. Slow & Measured Cuts Confident management of a soft landing; controlled disinflation. More stable, fundamentals-driven growth; sustained institutional interest. Paused or Delayed Cuts Persistent inflation or strong economic data. Continued pressure on risk assets; potential consolidation or downturn. Expert Analysis on Institutional Adoption Pathways Owen Lau’s perspective carries weight due to his role at Clear Street, a firm specializing in modernizing capital markets infrastructure. His analysis bridges traditional finance and the digital asset ecosystem. The entry of institutional investors is not a monolithic event but a gradual process influenced by several factors beyond just interest rates. These include regulatory clarity, the development of robust custody solutions, and the availability of regulated financial products like Bitcoin ETFs. Nevertheless, monetary policy acts as the overarching tide that lifts or lowers all boats. A lower-rate environment decreases the hedging and carry costs associated with large-scale crypto investments. It also makes the narrative of digital assets as “digital gold” or an inflation hedge more compelling if traditional fiat yields are diminishing. The convergence of a friendly Fed policy with maturing market infrastructure could create a powerful synergy for the 2026 landscape. Historical precedent offers some insight. The post-2020 period of near-zero rates and quantitative easing coincided with a historic bull run in cryptocurrencies. While the market structure has evolved, the fundamental relationship between cheap money and risk-asset appreciation remains a cornerstone of financial theory. Analysts now model how this relationship will manifest in a market with deeper liquidity and more sophisticated participants. The Interplay of Macroeconomic Forces and Digital Assets Cryptocurrencies no longer trade in a vacuum, isolated from global financial currents. Today, they react to U.S. dollar strength, Treasury yield movements, and equity market sentiment. This increased correlation, especially in times of stress, highlights the asset class’s integration into the broader financial system. Therefore, the Fed’s actions in 2025 and 2026 will reverberate through multiple channels. First, the direct channel involves investment allocation as described by Lau. Second, an indirect channel exists through the impact on technology stocks and growth equities, which often move in tandem with crypto assets. A bullish environment for Nasdaq, frequently fueled by lower rates, tends to create a supportive backdrop for crypto. Third, the psychological channel of “risk-on” versus “risk-off” sentiment is powerfully influenced by central bank messaging. Other global central banks, including the European Central Bank and the Bank of England, are on similar policy trajectories. Their synchronized or divergent actions will influence global dollar liquidity—a key metric for all internationally traded assets. A globally coordinated easing cycle could unleash a tidal wave of liquidity, while a fragmented approach might lead to more complex, region-specific market dynamics. Conclusion The pace of Federal Reserve interest rate cuts stands as the definitive macroeconomic variable for the 2026 cryptocurrency market. Analyst Owen Lau’s assessment underscores a fundamental shift where traditional monetary policy directly steers capital flows into digital assets. While regulatory developments and technological innovation provide the foundation, the Fed’s decisions on the cost of capital will likely determine the scale and timing of the next major market phase. Investors and observers must therefore monitor inflation data, employment reports, and FOMC communications with heightened attention, as these indicators will collectively chart the course for crypto market performance in the coming years. FAQs Q1: Why do Federal Reserve rate cuts affect the cryptocurrency market? Rate cuts lower returns on traditional safe-haven assets like bonds, making higher-risk, higher-potential-return assets like cryptocurrencies more attractive to both retail and institutional investors seeking yield. Q2: What did the Fed say in its December 2024 FOMC meeting minutes? The Federal Reserve stated it is prepared to adjust monetary policy as appropriate if risks emerge that could impede achieving its economic goals, indicating a data-dependent but flexible approach to future rate decisions. Q3: How could institutional investment change if rates fall? Lower rates reduce the cost of capital and hedging for large institutions, making substantial allocations to volatile assets like cryptocurrency more financially viable and strategically appealing within a diversified portfolio. Q4: Is the crypto market’s reaction to rate cuts guaranteed? While historical correlation exists, the reaction is not guaranteed. Market response also depends on concurrent factors like regulatory clarity, global economic health, and asset-specific developments within the crypto ecosystem. Q5: What other economic indicators should be watched alongside Fed announcements? Key indicators include Consumer Price Index (CPI) reports for inflation, unemployment data, GDP growth figures, and broader equity market performance, as these all inform the Fed’s policy decisions and overall market sentiment.

Metaplanet Spent $451 Million On Bitcoin In Q4 2025 As revealed by Metaplanet CEO Simon Gerovich in a new X post , the Bitcoin treasury company participated in some fresh accumulation over Q4 2025. In total, the firm added 4,279 BTC at an average buying price of $105,412 during this period. The latest announcement has followed three months of no new purchases from Metaplanet. The last time that the Japanese company added more BTC was in September, with two big buys involving more than 5,000 tokens each occurring in the second half of that month. About a week or so after the second of those purchases, Bitcoin formed a high above $126,000, which has acted as the top of the bull market so far. The firm has not been making announcements since then, which may be due to the fact that the asset has witnessed a notable drawdown. Nonetheless, the new announcement suggests that Metaplanet was silently buying tokens in the background, with the company only choosing to unveil it as 2025 approaches an end. As a result of this accumulation, Metaplanet’s holdings have grown significantly. Before the Q4 2025 buying spree, the firm held 30,823 BTC. Now, that figure has risen to 35,102 BTC. The Q4 2025 treasury expansion cost the company a total of $451.06 million, but due to the decline in the cryptocurrency’s price recently, the value of the tokens is down to $376.26 million today. The new accumulation isn’t the only portion of the Bitcoin treasury that has gone underwater; the firm’s entire holdings are in fact currently in a state of loss. With a cost basis of $107,606 per token, Metaplanet’s 35,102 BTC holdings cost $3.78 billion to assemble. Today, these coins are worth just $3.08 billion. Metaplanet is currently the fourth largest corporate holder of BTC in the world, as rankings from BitcoinTreasuries.net show. Even with its Q4 2025 buying, Metaplanet is still more than 8,000 BTC behind Twenty One Capital, which holds 43,514 BTC. Thus, Simon’s company will need a couple more purchases of this size to close in the gap. In the table, it’s apparent that Strategy , the OG treasury firm, is in a different stratosphere from the rest of the names on the list, with its total Bitcoin holdings standing at 672,497 BTC right now. Unlike Metaplanet, the Michael Saylor-led company continued to make regular purchase announcements even as BTC went through its bearish shift. The latest of these came up this Monday, with the firm loading up on 1,229 BTC. BTC Price At the time of writing, Bitcoin is floating around $88,000, unchanged from one week ago.",Bitcoin News|bitcoin|Bitcoin Treasury|Bitcoin Treasury Metaplanet|btc|BTCUSDT|Metaplanet,EN,0,0,BTC|REGULATION|DIGITAL ASSET TREASURY|MACROECONOMICS|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-12-31 01:00:20

Repeated attempts to reclaim higher levels have stalled, reinforcing growing skepticism among analysts who now openly discuss the risk of a broader bear market extending into 2026. Sentiment remains fragile, dominated by caution and reduced risk appetite, as traders wait for clearer confirmation of the next directional move.

Some investors argue that Bitcoin is entering a transitional phase rather than a full trend reversal. According to on-chain analyst Axel Adler, the current setup in Bitcoin’s “Supply in Profit” metric offers important context. Adler highlights that Supply in Profit has fallen sharply from October peaks above 19 million BTC to roughly 13.5 million BTC following the correction from all-time highs. This decline pushed the short-term 30-day moving average well below the 90-day average, creating a gap of around 1.75 million BTC. While a similar configuration appeared in 2022 before an extended bearish period, Adler notes a key difference this time: the 365-day moving average remains historically elevated. Importantly, the 30-day average appears to have formed a local bottom in mid-December and is beginning to stabilize. Adler argues that if Bitcoin can hold current price levels or higher, this stabilization could mark the early groundwork for a renewed bullish phase later in 2026. Supply in Profit Signals a Critical Inflection Window Axel Adler also shared a forward-looking forecast chart tracking the convergence between the 30-day and 90-day moving averages of Bitcoin’s Supply in Profit metric, offering a potential roadmap for the next structural shift. The model extrapolates current rates of change to estimate when a bullish configuration—defined by SMA 30 crossing above SMA 90—could emerge. According to Adler’s analysis, the gap between these two moving averages is currently narrowing at a pace of roughly 28,000 BTC per day. Importantly, this convergence is not being driven by a sharp recovery in Supply in Profit, but by a mechanical decline in the SMA 90. As peak October values, when Supply in Profit reached 19–20 million BTC, roll out of the 90-day calculation window, downward pressure on the longer average creates a temporary “tailwind” for convergence. This effect is expected to persist through late January. If current conditions hold, Adler projects a potential bullish cross forming between late February and early March. However, the forecast remains highly price-sensitive. Supply elasticity to price is estimated at 1.3x, meaning a 10% price decline could trigger a 13% drop in Supply in Profit. The $70,000 level is critical according to the forecast. Below it, SMA 30 would likely fall faster than SMA 90, invalidating the convergence thesis and reopening a 2022-style prolonged recovery scenario. Related Reading: Chainlink Shows Strong Accumulation Signal: LINK Exchange Liquidity Dries Up Bitcoin Price Struggles Below Key Resistance Bitcoin continues to trade below the $90,000 threshold, reflecting a market that remains structurally weak despite short-term stabilization. The chart shows BTC consolidating after a sharp breakdown from the $100,000–$105,000 region, a move that decisively flipped prior support into resistance. This rejection marked a clear loss of bullish control and initiated a deeper corrective phase. Price now compresses below the downward-sloping 50-day and 100-day moving averages.. This configuration reinforces the prevailing bearish trend and suggests that upside attempts are likely to face supply pressure. The 200-day moving average, currently well above spot price, highlights how far BTC has drifted from its longer-term trend equilibrium. Related Reading: Why $100,000 Is Bitcoin’s Most Important Resistance Level Momentum has cooled notably since the November sell-off. While selling intensity has eased, the absence of strong bullish volume indicates that buyers remain cautious. The recent price action resembles a consolidation range rather than a reversal, with BTC oscillating between roughly $85,000 and $90,000. This behavior often reflects indecision rather than accumulation. For now, $90,000 remains the critical level bulls must reclaim to shift sentiment meaningfully. Failure to do so keeps downside risks in play, with $85,000 acting as near-term support. Until price regains key moving averages, the broader structure favors continued range-bound or corrective price action.

The OG crypto had gone on a monster rally earlier this year making one all-time high after another, mostly thanks to Trump taking back the White House. But recent uncertainties and intense leverage have dragged Bitcoin down enough to end 2025 in the red. Bitcoin’s price last traded at $88,242, leaving Bitcoin down about 6% for the year and roughly 30% below its record high of nearly $126,000, which was reached in early October, according to data from CoinGecko. ETFs and regulation drive rebound expectations Some analysts still expect Bitcoin to rebound in early 2026, even if the recovery does not last.Citi Research’s says near-term support could come from the expansion of crypto exchange-traded funds, which continue to bring better access for both retail and institutional investors. In a note written Dec. 18, Citi analyst Alex Saunders said Bitcoin predictions assume adoption continues and ETF inflows reach $15 billion, but that level can only rally prices in the short term. Citi has reportedly set a base-case target of $143,000 over the next 12 months for Bitcoin. The bank also shared a bull-case target of $189,000 and a bear-case level of $78,000 for the same period. Meanwhile, attention remains on Strategy, the largest corporate holder of Bitcoin, as another signal for price direction. In a Dec. 3 note, JPMorgan strategist Nikolaos Panigirtzoglou pointed to the company’s enterprise-value-to-holdings ratio, which remains above 1.0, a level that reassures markets that the company can avoid selling its holdings during stress. “If this ratio stays above 1.0 and MicroStrategy can eventually avoid selling bitcoins, markets will likely be reassured and the worst for bitcoin prices will likely be behind us,” Nikolaos wrote. “We also find encouraging MicroStrategy’s creation of a $1.4bn reserve fund for future dividend and interest payments,” Nikolaos added, saying that it reduces the risk of forced sales. Though according to Cryptoquant, Bitcoin’s long-term holders continue to focus on the traditional four-year cycle that has historically determined prices. Jaime Leverton, chief executive officer of ReserveOne, said on CNBC’s Squawk Box that the old cycle is fading as the industry gains stronger support in the United States. “I actually think we’ll see a new Bitcoin all-time high next year, which would really be the final nail in the coffin for the historical cycle,” Jaime said.

Speaking recently, Zhao projected that Pakistan could emerge as one of the world’s crypto leaders by the year 2030. This prediction, made in an interview with the Pakistan Crypto Council’s CEO and reported by Cointelegraph, hinges on the nation’s ability to sustain its current regulatory and adoption trajectory. The remarks spotlight a nation often discussed for its economic challenges rather than its technological potential, offering a fresh narrative for the global cryptocurrency landscape. Changpeng Zhao’s Vision for Pakistan’s Crypto Future Changpeng Zhao’s analysis provides a structured framework for Pakistan’s potential ascent. He specifically commended the country’s leadership for what he termed “rapid execution” in recognizing the burgeoning demand for digital assets. Furthermore, Zhao highlighted a critical demographic advantage: Pakistan’s large, young, and technologically adept population. This cohort represents both a massive user base and a potential talent pool for blockchain development. For context, over 60% of Pakistan’s population is under the age of 30, a statistic that aligns perfectly with global crypto adoption trends favoring younger generations. Zhao’s comments, therefore, are not mere speculation but an observation grounded in verifiable demographic and behavioral data. The Foundation of Regulatory Momentum The pathway to leadership, as outlined by Zhao, is contingent on maintaining regulatory momentum. In recent years, Pakistani authorities have engaged in serious discussions about digital asset frameworks. The State Bank of Pakistan and the Securities and Exchange Commission of Pakistan (SECP) have initiated studies and consultations. For instance, the SECP has been exploring regulatory models for digital assets, looking at jurisdictions like Singapore and the United Kingdom for guidance. This cautious yet proactive approach aims to balance innovation with consumer protection and financial integrity. Sustaining this delicate balance is the central challenge Zhao identifies for Pakistan’s crypto regulation journey toward 2030. Global Context and Pakistan’s Unique Position To understand the weight of Zhao’s prediction, one must examine the global crypto landscape. Leadership is not defined by adoption alone but by a combination of factors including regulatory clarity, technological innovation, and market influence. Currently, hubs like Singapore, Switzerland, and the United Arab Emirates set benchmarks for regulatory frameworks. Meanwhile, nations like India and Nigeria lead in raw user adoption rates. Pakistan’s opportunity lies in synthesizing these elements. Its large, unbanked population presents a prime use case for blockchain-based financial solutions, a point often emphasized by financial inclusion advocates. The following table contrasts key factors for crypto leadership: Factor Current Leader Example Pakistan’s Potential Regulatory Clarity Singapore (Payment Services Act) Developing framework via SECP Youth Adoption Nigeria (High peer-to-peer volume) ~64% population under 30 Tech Talent United States (Developer hubs) Growing IT export sector Financial Inclusion Drive Kenya (Mobile money success) ~100 million adults, significant unbanked This comparative view illustrates that Pakistan possesses foundational elements observed in other successful markets. However, the convergence of these factors under a coherent national strategy remains the critical next step. Demographics as a Decisive Driver The role of Pakistan’s demographic profile cannot be overstated. A young population typically correlates with higher digital literacy and greater openness to new financial technologies. Reports from blockchain analytics firms consistently show that regions with younger median ages see faster adoption of cryptocurrencies. This trend is driven by several factors: Remittance Efficiency: Pakistan is a top recipient of global remittances. Crypto offers a potentially faster and cheaper corridor. Inflation Hedge: In economies with currency volatility, digital assets are often explored as alternative stores of value. Entrepreneurial Spirit: Young Pakistanis are increasingly launching tech startups, with blockchain as a natural frontier. Consequently, the “demand for digital assets” that Zhao referenced is not abstract. It is a tangible response to specific economic conditions and opportunities perceived by its youth. Challenges on the Road to 2030 Leadership While the potential is significant, the path is fraught with substantial hurdles. Achieving digital asset adoption at a leadership scale requires overcoming deep-seated challenges. First, Pakistan must finalize and implement a clear, comprehensive regulatory framework. Ambiguity can stifle investment and innovation. Second, the country faces persistent macroeconomic pressures, including inflation and currency devaluation, which can create a volatile environment for any new asset class. Third, technological infrastructure, particularly consistent internet access in rural areas, requires continued investment. Finally, Pakistan must navigate complex international financial regulations and anti-money laundering standards to ensure its crypto ecosystem integrates smoothly with the global economy. Success depends on addressing these areas simultaneously. Expert Perspectives on Viability Financial technology analysts echo both Zhao’s optimism and caution. Dr. Ayesha Khan, a fintech researcher focusing on South Asia, notes, “Pakistan’s crypto journey mirrors early stages seen in other emerging markets. The regulatory intent is there, but the test will be in execution and creating an environment that attracts legitimate projects while deterring bad actors.” Meanwhile, the International Monetary Fund has engaged with Pakistan on the potential macroeconomic implications of crypto assets, emphasizing the need for a risk-based regulatory approach. These expert views underscore that Zhao’s prediction is a conditional one, reliant on strategic policy decisions made in the coming years. Conclusion Changpeng Zhao’s projection that Pakistan could become a crypto leader by 2030 provides a compelling, evidence-based vision for the country’s digital future. It is a forecast rooted in the observable momentum of its regulatory discussions and the undeniable force of its demographic dividend. However, leadership is not assured. It demands sustained, strategic action across regulation, education, infrastructure, and international cooperation. If Pakistan can maintain its current momentum and translate its potential into structured policy, Zhao’s prediction may well transition from hopeful commentary to economic reality, reshaping the nation’s financial landscape and its position in the global digital economy. FAQs Q1: What exactly did Changpeng Zhao say about Pakistan and crypto? Former Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao stated that Pakistan has the potential to become one of the world’s leaders in cryptocurrency by 2030. He praised the country’s rapid regulatory progress and highlighted its large, young, tech-friendly population as key drivers for this potential. Q2: Why is Pakistan’s young population important for crypto adoption? Younger populations globally show higher rates of digital literacy and openness to new technologies like cryptocurrency. With over 60% of Pakistanis under 30, this creates a vast potential user base and talent pool for blockchain development and digital asset adoption. Q3: What are the main challenges Pakistan faces in becoming a crypto leader? Key challenges include establishing clear and comprehensive cryptocurrency regulations, managing macroeconomic instability, improving digital infrastructure nationwide, and ensuring compliance with international financial standards to foster a secure and sustainable ecosystem. Q4: How is Pakistan currently regulating cryptocurrency? Regulatory bodies like the Securities and Exchange Commission of Pakistan (SECP) are actively studying frameworks. The approach is currently cautious, with authorities examining models from other countries to develop rules that encourage innovation while managing risks related to fraud and financial stability. Q5: What would ‘crypto leadership’ for Pakistan realistically look like by 2030? Leadership would likely involve Pakistan being recognized as a regional hub for blockchain innovation, with a clear regulatory framework that attracts investment, a high rate of responsible digital asset usage among its citizens, and a thriving ecosystem of local crypto and Web3 businesses contributing to the economy.

Announced in early 2025, this collaboration aims to construct critical infrastructure that seamlessly connects real-world commerce with the burgeoning AI economy. Consequently, this initiative promises to expand practical cryptocurrency utility for millions of users and merchants worldwide. AEON United Stables Partnership: A Technical Deep Dive The core of the AEON United Stables partnership involves a dual integration across AEON’s ecosystem. First, AEON will add United Stables (U) as a supported payment method on its AEON Pay service. Second, the company will integrate U as a settlement asset on the BNB Chain via its proprietary x402 Facilitator. This technical architecture is specifically designed to enhance transaction speed and reduce costs for cross-border settlements. AEON Pay, accessible currently through a Telegram Mini App, already supports integration with major cryptocurrency wallets. These include Binance Wallet, OKX Wallet, and Bybit. The addition of United Stables significantly broadens the available options for users. Furthermore, this integration directly supports AEON’s stated mission to build a robust payment and settlement layer tailored for the AI economy. The Expanding Reach of Real-World Crypto Payments This partnership has immediate, tangible implications for global commerce. As a direct result, AEON Pay users can now transact with United Stables (U) at a network of over 50 million affiliated merchants. Initial focus regions include high-growth markets in Southeast Asia, Latin America, and Africa. The company has also confirmed plans for further geographical expansion throughout 2025. The move addresses a persistent challenge in cryptocurrency adoption: bridging the gap between digital asset holdings and everyday purchases. By leveraging a stablecoin, the partnership mitigates the price volatility typically associated with cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin or Ethereum. Therefore, both merchants and consumers gain a predictable medium of exchange. This stability is crucial for fostering trust and encouraging widespread use in daily transactions. Expert Analysis: Why This Partnership Matters Now Industry analysts point to several converging trends that make this partnership particularly timely. The global AI economy is projected to grow exponentially, creating new demand for automated, efficient, and borderless payment rails. Simultaneously, stablecoins have matured from speculative assets into legitimate tools for payment and settlement. A 2024 report from the Bank for International Settlements highlighted the growing use of stablecoins in remittances and merchant services. By choosing BNB Chain for settlement, AEON and United Stables tap into an ecosystem known for high throughput and relatively low fees. This technical choice is strategic for scaling micro-payments, which are anticipated to be a hallmark of AI-driven services. For instance, an AI agent might need to pay a small fee for a data query or a computational task in real-time. The combined infrastructure of AEON Pay and United Stables on BNB Chain is engineered to facilitate such use cases efficiently. Building the Infrastructure for an AI-Driven Financial Future The collaboration extends beyond simple payment processing. The integration with the x402 Facilitator suggests a focus on deeper settlement layer functionality. In blockchain terms, a facilitator often acts as a middleware component that streamlines complex processes like cross-chain communication or compliance checks. This indicates that the partnership is laying groundwork for more sophisticated financial instruments and automated settlements within the AI sector. Potential applications are vast. Consider an autonomous AI freelancer platform where algorithms complete tasks and receive payment in U stablecoins settled instantly via AEON. Another example is AI-managed investment portfolios that use the infrastructure for rebalancing assets across different protocols. The partnership effectively provides the monetary plumbing for these next-generation economic activities. Enhanced Merchant Adoption: Reduces friction for shops to accept crypto by using a price-stable asset. User Accessibility: Leverages the massive reach of Telegram and popular wallets to lower the entry barrier.

This filing, submitted to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) in March 2025, targets a diverse basket of assets including AAVE, UNI, and ZEC. Consequently, this proposal marks a pivotal expansion beyond the established Bitcoin and Ethereum ETF products. The application details a novel 60% direct spot investment strategy, potentially reshaping how traditional investors gain exposure to the crypto ecosystem. Bitwise Crypto ETFs: Deconstructing the 11-Fund Proposal Bitwise’s latest filing seeks to list ETFs for 11 distinct cryptocurrencies. The list prominently features governance tokens from leading decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols, such as Aave (AAVE) and Uniswap (UNI). Furthermore, it includes privacy-focused assets like Zcash (ZEC), newer layer-1 blockchain tokens including NEAR, SUI, and TRON’s TRX, and other specialized digital assets like Ethena’s ENA and Bittensor’s TAO. Each proposed fund would operate under a consistent structural framework. According to the filing, a minimum of 60% of each fund’s assets would be held directly in the underlying spot cryptocurrency. The remaining portion would be allocated to other exchange-traded products (ETPs) that track the same asset. Additionally, the funds reserve the right to use futures contracts and other derivatives for precise exposure management. This hybrid model aims to combine the direct ownership benefits of a spot ETF with the flexibility of derivative instruments. The Strategic Composition and Target Assets The selection of assets reveals a calculated strategy by Bitwise. The inclusion of AAVE and UNI directly targets the growing institutional interest in decentralized finance. These tokens govern two of the largest DeFi protocols by total value locked. Meanwhile, assets like NEAR and SUI represent investments in competing smart contract platforms aiming to scale blockchain technology. The filing also covers a wide range of crypto sectors, from artificial intelligence (Bittensor’s TAO) to real-world asset tokenization. This diversified approach suggests Bitwise is betting on multiple narratives within the broader digital asset space rather than a single trend. The 60/40 spot-to-ETP ratio is a critical detail, designed to provide robust underlying asset backing while maintaining operational liquidity. SEC Implications and the Evolving Regulatory Landscape This filing arrives during a period of intense scrutiny and gradual acceptance from U.S. regulators. The SEC’s approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs in January 2024 established a crucial precedent. However, approving ETFs for a broader set of altcoins presents new regulatory challenges. The central question remains the legal classification of each asset. The SEC has previously suggested that many cryptocurrencies, beyond Bitcoin, could be considered securities. Bitwise’s filing, therefore, acts as a direct test case. It challenges the SEC to apply its regulatory framework to a suite of complex digital assets. Approval would signal a major shift, effectively granting a regulatory stamp to a wider crypto market segment. Conversely, rejection or delay would reaffirm the current cautious stance and likely focus future ETF applications only on the largest assets like Ethereum. Expert Analysis on Approval Prospects and Timeline Financial legal experts point to a potentially lengthy review process. “The SEC will meticulously examine the liquidity, custody solutions, and market manipulation safeguards for each of these 11 assets,” notes a former SEC enforcement attorney specializing in digital assets. The process involves public commentary periods and potential revisions, often taking several months to over a year. Analysts from Bloomberg Intelligence have previously modeled approval probabilities for Ethereum ETFs, but models for this broader basket are less established. The outcome may hinge on ongoing litigation and legislative developments, such as the FIT for the 21st Century Act, which seeks to clarify crypto market regulation. Bitwise’s established track record as a registered investment adviser and its existing suite of crypto index products may bolster its application’s credibility with regulators. Potential Market Impact and Investor Accessibility The launch of these ETFs would dramatically lower the barrier to entry for a vast pool of investors. Currently, direct investment in assets like AAVE or ZEC requires navigating cryptocurrency exchanges, managing private keys, and understanding wallet technology. An ETF, traded on traditional exchanges like NYSE Arca, simplifies this process entirely. Investors could buy and sell shares through their existing brokerage accounts. This accessibility could funnel significant new capital into the crypto markets. Moreover, the structure provides a regulated, audited, and custodially secure vehicle—a key concern for institutional allocators like pension funds and endowments. The 60% direct spot holding is particularly significant. It ensures a substantial portion of the fund’s capital directly purchases and holds the native tokens, creating consistent buy-side pressure on the underlying markets. Comparative Analysis with Existing Crypto ETPs Product Type Example Primary Holding Key Advantage Bitwise Proposed ETF Bitwise AAVE ETF 60% Spot AAVE, 40% AAVE ETPs Direct spot exposure, regulated structure Futures-based ETF ProShares Bitcoin Strategy ETF (BITO) Bitcoin Futures Contracts No direct custody needed Grantor Trust Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) Direct Spot Bitcoin Direct asset backing European ETP 21Shares AAVE ETP (AAVE) Direct Spot AAVE Available in non-U.S. markets The table highlights Bitwise’s hybrid model. It differs from futures-based ETFs, which carry roll cost risks, and from grantor trusts, which often trade at significant premiums or discounts to net asset value. While similar spot products exist in Europe, a U.S.-listed ETF would tap into the world’s largest capital market. Conclusion Bitwise’s filing for 11 new crypto ETFs represents a bold strategic push into the next frontier of digital asset investment products. By targeting assets like AAVE and UNI with a 60% spot-backed model, the firm is testing the boundaries of current SEC policy. The proposal’s success hinges on regulatory interpretation, market infrastructure, and demonstrated investor protection mechanisms. If approved, these Bitwise crypto ETFs would unlock unprecedented mainstream access to a diversified portfolio of cryptocurrency innovations, potentially catalyzing the next wave of institutional adoption. The market now awaits the SEC’s response, which will set a definitive course for the integration of altcoins into the regulated financial mainstream. FAQs Q1: What cryptocurrencies are included in Bitwise’s new ETF filing? Bitwise’s filing proposes ETFs for 11 assets: AAVE, UNI, ZEC, CC, ENA, HYPE, NEAR, STRK, SUI, TAO, and TRX. This list includes DeFi governance tokens, layer-1 blockchain tokens, and other specialized digital assets. Q2: How would these proposed ETFs be structured? Each ETF would invest at least 60% of its assets directly in the spot (actual) cryptocurrency. The remaining portion (up to 40%) would be allocated to other exchange-traded products that hold the same asset. The funds may also use derivatives like futures for exposure management. Q3: Why is the 60% direct spot investment important? This structure ensures a majority of the fund’s capital directly purchases and holds the underlying tokens. This creates tangible buy-side demand in the crypto markets and provides shareholders with more direct economic exposure compared to a fund holding only futures contracts. Q4: What is the main regulatory hurdle for these ETFs? The primary hurdle is the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission’s (SEC) view on whether these specific cryptocurrencies are classified as securities or commodities. The SEC has been hesitant to approve spot ETFs for assets it considers securities, which has been a point of contention for many altcoins. Q5: When could these Bitwise crypto ETFs potentially launch? There is no guaranteed timeline. The SEC review process for novel products is often lengthy, involving multiple rounds of comments and revisions. Based on prior ETF approvals, the process could take anywhere from several months to over a year, assuming the application is ultimately approved.

The move comes as the court reviews a potential retrial for two brothers accused of exploiting the Ethereum blockchain to obtain $25 million. In a filing dated Tuesday, December 30, in the US District Court for the Southern District of New York, interim US Attorney for the Southern District of New York, Jay Clayton wrote to Jessica Clarke, a United States district judge in New York requesting her to decline the DeFi Education Fund’s (DEF) brief while the court evaluates a motion to withdraw the allegations raised against Anton and James Peraire-Bueno. US Attorney Clayton raised concerns about DEF’s amicus brief In a statement, US Attorney Clayton argued that DEF’s amicus brief, which is disconnected from the trial record, restates some legal claims that the court has already rejected. He further explained, “Since the Court has already made decisions on the legal matters discussed in the amicus brief and DEF does not provide any new information relevant to the current motion, their submission is unlikely to help the Court in considering these specific issues [related to a motion for acquittal].” Considering the intense nature of the situation, reports dated November noted that Judge Clarke declared a mistrial just after jurors found it difficult to decide whether the two brothers should be pronounced guilty or not guilty. Regarding the case raised against the brothers, sources close to the situation claimed that they were accused of inappropriately utilizing automated maximal extractable value (MEV) bots for their own benefit. Later in the week, the US government requested that the court consider setting a retrial date for either late February or early March 2026. At this point, a draft representing the DEF brief, issued on December 19, illustrated that the organization supported the motion to clear or withdraw the claims against the two brothers. According to them, the case presented significant consequences for the industry. DEF further commented on the matter, stating that, “[P]rosecutions like this one create confusion and fear among software developers, discouraging involvement in DeFi and pushing participants to other countries”. They added, “The DOJ should not rush into indictments based on misinterpretations of current laws, as this will hinder growth by creating uncertainty about the rules.” Uncertainties surrounding the two brothers’ fate raise controversy in the ecosystem The announcement regarding the US government’s opposition to the Defi Education Fund’s brief prompted several reporters to reach out to the organization for comment on the situation. However, it declined to respond. Even with this decline, analysts noted that several individuals in the crypto industry are still paying close attention to the possibility of how this case could impact MEV-related activities. The individual adopted this move at a time when uncertainties surrounding the fate of the Peraire-Bueno brothers grew intense. Meanwhile, reports unveiled that Coin Center, a leading non-profit research and advocacy center focused on crypto-related matters, issued an amicus brief during the criminal trial. Sources claimed that this brief opposed the US government’s outlook. As a result, prosecutors requested the court to discard the brief. On the other hand, another reliable source disclosed that the two brothers initially encountered allegations including conspiracy to commit wire fraud, money laundering activities, and conspiracy to acquire stolen property. With these claims in place, they noted that if, by any chance, the brothers undergo a retrial on these similar allegations and are found guilty, they could be subjected to a prison sentence of up to 20 years for each count.

Analyst Answers,https://www.newsbtc.com/news/bitcoin/bitcoin-price-closes-2025-red/,"Bitcoin is heading into the final stretch of 2025 with an unusual setup. Despite printing a new all-time high in October, the price has since pulled back enough to put the annual performance at risk of closing negative. That difference puts into context how the current cycle should be interpreted and what it means for Bitcoin’s price outlook. According to one analyst, the answer is less dramatic than it may appear at first glance, and Bitcoin might be about to enter into a bear market. A Red Close Would Identify A Bear Market, Not A Broken Cycle Bitcoin’s long-term price action has often followed a familiar rhythm, with three consecutive green yearly candles eventually giving way to a red close. This sequence has appeared multiple times since 2011, leading many traders to expect the same structure to repeat in the current cycle. This time, however, the pattern has shifted. Although both 2023 and 2024 closed in the green, 2025 is on track to finish negative, interrupting the usual progression. Related Reading: Why The Current XRP Valuation Doesn’t Make Sense Crypto analyst CryptoBullet noted that a red close for Bitcoin in 2025 would simply confirm that the cycle has transitioned into a bear phase, not that the four-year cycle is broken. In his view, the color of the yearly candle is often misunderstood. What matters most is where Bitcoin forms its cycle highs and lows, not whether a specific post-halving year finishes green or red. He explains that if 2025 closes in the red, the yearly candle is likely to form a doji candlestick. In technical analysis, doji candles reflect indecision after strong upside expansion and often lead to trend reversals. In this context, such a close would correspond with Bitcoin having already completed its cycle top earlier in October, when it reached a new peak of $126,080. In previous cycles, once a new high is set in the post-halving year, Bitcoin’s price action transitions into a prolonged corrective phase regardless of how that year ultimately closes. Bitcoin Chart Image From X. Source: @CryptoBullet1 What To Expect For Bitcoin In 2026 Responding to comments on his technical analysis on X, Crypto analyst CryptoBullet reiterated that he is sticking with an analysis he first shared on December 2, which also proposes that Bitcoin’s cycle top is already in. Bitcoin opened 2025 around $93,396 and has since fallen well below its October peak, a structure he says closely resembles the post-top consolidation seen in 2019. Related Reading: $130 Million XRP Fumble: Analyst Reveals What Went Wrong In that earlier cycle, Bitcoin spent months trading roughly 30% below its high while altcoins, measured through the OTHERS/BTC chart, formed a cycle bottom and began to recover. CryptoBullet believes the same dynamic is unfolding now, but on a larger scale, with altcoins having underperformed Bitcoin for nearly four years. Bitcoin Bear Market Setup. Source: @CryptoBullet1 on X Based on that setup, he expects a dead cat bounce in early 2026, accompanied by a short-lived rotation into altcoins, before a much deeper correction takes hold across Bitcoin as the bear market progresses.

56622849,649612,1767146434,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/56622849.jpeg,End Of Bitcoin Distribution? Key Data Reveals A Shift In LTH Behavior,https://bitcoinist.com/end-of-bitcoin-distribution-data-reveals-shift-lth/,"Bitcoin continues to trade below the $90,000 level, struggling to regain bullish momentum as market sentiment deteriorates. A growing number of analysts are now openly calling for a broader bear market, pointing to persistent weakness, failed breakouts, and declining risk appetite across crypto. Despite this gloomy backdrop, not all market participants are convinced that Bitcoin’s next major move will be lower. Some investors remain focused on 2026, arguing that structural conditions could begin to shift in the coming months. One of the key debates centers on long-term holders (LTHs). While social media narratives increasingly claim that LTHs are distributing Bitcoin at record levels, on-chain data suggests a more nuanced reality. According to a report by analyst Darkfost, much of the perceived LTH selling has been distorted by large, isolated movements—particularly nearly 800,000 BTC transferred from Coinbase—which skewed traditional LTH metrics. After adjusting the data to exclude this anomaly, a clear change in supply dynamics emerges. Rather than accelerating distribution, the adjusted chart shows signs that long-term holder supply is stabilizing, and in some cases beginning to recover. This challenges the dominant bearish narrative and suggests that selling pressure from seasoned holders may be fading. As Bitcoin consolidates below key resistance, the divergence between price weakness and shifting on-chain behavior sets the stage for a critical inflection point ahead. Long-Term Holders Reduce Selling Pressure Darkfost adds important context to the evolving Bitcoin narrative by focusing on long-term holder (LTH) supply dynamics. According to his analysis, the monthly LTH supply change—measured as a 30-day rolling sum—had remained firmly locked in a distribution phase since July 16. For several months, this metric consistently showed negative readings, confirming that long-term holders were gradually reducing their exposure and releasing supply into the market. That trend has now shifted. The latest data shows the metric moving back into positive territory, with approximately 10,700 BTC transitioning into long-term held coins. While this figure is still relatively small in absolute terms, it marks a clear inflection from sustained distribution to early re-accumulation. In practical terms, it suggests that LTHs have slowed their selling activity to the point where their aggregate supply is beginning to grow again. This shift is particularly notable because it is occurring while short-term holders (STHs) continue to hold their positions rather than aggressively selling. The combination points to a cooling of sell-side pressure from both cohorts, even as price remains under pressure. Historically, similar transitions in LTH supply behavior have often preceded periods of sideways consolidation or, in more constructive cases, the early stages of bullish recoveries. While this signal alone does not guarantee an upside move, it does suggest that the market may be moving away from forced distribution and toward a more balanced phase, depending on how broader macro and price trends develop. Bitcoin Consolidates Above Long-Term Support Bitcoin’s price action continues to reflect a market caught between structural support and lingering downside pressure. After failing to hold above the $100K–$105K region earlier in the quarter, BTC entered a sharp corrective phase that accelerated into November. That move pushed price decisively below the 50-day and 100-day moving averages, confirming a short-term trend shift from expansion to contraction. At present, Bitcoin is consolidating around the $88K zone, hovering just above the rising 200-day moving average, which sits slightly lower and continues to act as a critical long-term support. This area has become a key battleground: repeated downside wicks suggest buyers are defending the level, but upside follow-through remains limited. The declining slope of the shorter moving averages reinforces the idea that bullish momentum has not yet returned. Volume dynamics also support a consolidation narrative rather than active accumulation. Selling pressure has eased compared to the November breakdown, but demand has not expanded meaningfully enough to reclaim prior resistance. Structurally, the market appears to be transitioning from a high-volatility selloff into a compression phase. As long as BTC holds above the 200-day moving average, the broader bullish structure from earlier in the cycle remains technically intact. However, a failure to defend this level would expose the $80K–$75K region as the next major support.

While most investors chase the headlines, savvy traders know that the real gains are often made before the public launch. With major tokens like APEMARS already sparking intense interest, the question isn’t whether you’ll make money but whether you’re early enough to make the biggest profits. As established projects like Stellar and Hedera continue to hold their ground, new presales like APEMARS are positioning themselves for explosive growth. Could this be the next 100x play in the making? Or will you miss your chance to get in before the wave takes off? The clock is ticking, and the upcoming best presale crypto project is gaining momentum fast. APEMARS Maps Its Course Early, and These Windows Rarely Stay Open Long APEMARS is a narrative-driven, community-powered crypto project designed as a fast-moving mission to Mars. Inspired by Commander Ape’s legendary journey, the project compresses a symbolic 225-million-kilometer voyage into a structured 23-stage rollout. Each stage represents progress, a tighter supply, and a higher price point as the mission advances. What places APEMARS among the Best Presale Crypto Projects is not just its entry price. It is the way the system is engineered. Stages advance on a fixed weekly timeline. Supply shrinks as the mission moves forward. There are no resets, no rewinds, and no waiting for the market to catch up. Right now, the mission is in its whitelist phase. This is the quiet moment before acceleration, where positioning matters more than noise. Why Whitelist Positioning Matters: A Scenario That Tells the Story Imagine two participants watching the same mission unfold. One joins the whitelist early. They receive updates before the public, prepare their wallet in advance, and are ready when Stage 1 opens at the planned price of $0.00001699. They secure their allocation before demand begins to build and supply starts tightening. The other waits. They see the project trending later, after multiple stages have already passed. The price is higher, supply is thinner, and the early window is gone. Now consider a hypothetical example. If a whitelist participant were positioned at the opening Stage 1 price with a $2,000 allocation, that would equate to roughly 117 million tokens. If the project were to reach its stated target listing price of $0.0055, that allocation would be valued at over $640,000. This is not a guarantee. Markets fluctuate, outcomes vary, and crypto carries risk. But it illustrates why early access matters in structured launches. Each stage that passes changes the equation. On top of that, holders who remain committed post-launch can participate in the planned staking system, earning additional rewards over time simply by holding and staking. The combination of early pricing and long-term yield is where the strategy comes together. This is why the whitelist matters. It is not about rushing. It is about being ready before the mission accelerates. How to Join the APEMARS Whitelist Joining the whitelist is the official way to position ahead of wider access and prepare for Stage 1. Steps to join: Visit the official APEMARS website: All whitelist registrations and updates are handled there. Avoid third-party links. Enter your email address: This ensures you receive priority notifications before Stage 1 opens and as the mission progresses. Follow official channels: Whitelist members receive early updates on timelines, access windows, and upcoming features. Prepare for Stage 1: When Stage 1 opens, the mission timeline moves forward automatically. Early preparation reduces the risk of missing the lowest pricing window. The mission does not pause. Each week advances the journey. Stellar Network Defies Market Trends, Showcases Resilience and Liquidity In a crypto market where volatility is often the norm, Stellar (XLM) continues to prove its value as a stable, payment-focused blockchain. Despite recent fluctuations across the sector, Stellar maintains solid real-world usage, with steady trading activity and liquidity that remains resilient even during periods of reduced market momentum. Stellar’s transparent supply structure offers a clear advantage, giving investors confidence by providing visibility into token availability and reducing concerns about unexpected dilution. This operational transparency, combined with its foundational role in cross-border payments, makes Stellar a cornerstone for payment-oriented blockchains. While price movements may not be aggressive, the network’s fundamentals and reliability position Stellar as a key reference point in the broader market. As the market looks for stability in uncertain times, Stellar stands tall as an asset for long-term, conservative growth. Hedera Stays Strong Amidst Market Pressure, Signals Long-Term Confidence Hedera (HBAR) is navigating a pivotal phase, holding strong despite recent market pressures. While the network has experienced some consolidation, trading activity remains robust, signaling that market interest is far from fading. The active volume underscores continued participation, and the blockchain’s fundamentals keep it firmly on the radar for investors who see long-term potential in infrastructure-focused projects. What sets Hedera apart is its capped supply structure and governance framework, which instill confidence in its long-term viability. Even as price movements continue to react to broader market sentiment, Hedera’s underlying enterprise adoption and innovative technology continue to provide a solid foundation. Hedera is not just a short-term play but a project with a sustainable future, making it a critical player for investors looking for stability in the fast-moving crypto landscape. Why Best Presale Crypto Projects Create Regret for Late Buyers In the world of crypto, markets move fast, often repricing without any warning. While established projects provide a sense of stability, the best presale crypto projects introduce a unique level of asymmetry. The price discovery process is still underway, and early opportunities can disappear in an instant. This is exactly where late-buyer regret takes root. APEMARS , currently in its early presale stages, operates with a structured, irreversible pricing model. Once a stage closes, the entry price is permanently locked, and the chance to buy at a lower rate is gone. As the presale progresses, the token supply tightens, and prices increase, what once seemed like a small entry price becomes a distant memory for those who hesitate. Historically, the best presale crypto projects reward those who take decisive action when information is available, and attention is still limited. APEMARS is moving quickly through its stages, and the potential rewards for early entry are significant. Take action now, assess the risks, and secure your position before the next stage drives the price higher. Timing matters; once these opportunities are gone, they won’t return.

Is APEMARS considered risky compared to established coins? Like all presales, APEMARS carries risk, but its clearly defined stages, locked team allocation, and transparent roadmap help reduce uncertainty. Compared to random launches, structured presales tend to offer clearer expectations for participants evaluating early-stage crypto exposure. Can beginners participate in crypto presales like APEMARS? Yes, beginners often find structured presales easier to understand because pricing changes follow a fixed schedule. APEMARS uses a simple buying process with standard wallets, clear stage progression, and defined utilities, making it accessible even for first-time presale participants. Summary Best Presale Crypto Projects attract attention because they allow early positioning before broader market exposure and exchange liquidity. APEMARS is emerging as a standout due to its structured 23-stage mission model, designed to progress on a fixed timeline rather than market hype. The project is planned to open at $0.00001699 in Stage 1, with a target listing price of $0.0055, creating a wide upside window for early participants. Unlike established networks such as Stellar and Hedera, which focus on long-term stability, presales like APEMARS offer asymmetric opportunities by enabling entry before public trading begins. Its stage-based pricing, scheduled supply reductions, staking framework, and referral-driven community growth combine structure with momentum. For investors researching Best Presale Crypto Projects, APEMARS represents a carefully planned whitelist-first opportunity focused on early access, timing, and long-term ecosystem development rather than short-term speculation.

Hong Kong trading stayed cautious, with local volumes running below the yearly average and the Hang Seng Index giving up ground ahead of the holiday. Hong Kong and Australian markets are set for early holiday closes, while exchanges in Japan and South Korea remain closed for the session. Fed Minutes Keep Rate Expectations Anchored Zooming out, global equities still head into the close of 2025 with strong gains, and the MSCI All Country World Equity Index set a fresh high of 1,024.29 on Dec. 26, up about 21.24% over the past 12 months. In the US, stocks traded choppily in holiday-thin conditions on Tuesday, and Meta shares climbed after the company said it would acquire AI startup Manus, adding another headline catalyst to a market searching for one. Investors also parsed the Federal Reserve’s latest meeting minutes, which showed a deeply divided debate behind December’s rate cut, with the next policy meeting scheduled for Jan. 27 to 28 and markets leaning toward a hold. For crypto markets, the near-term question stays straightforward, whether fresh inflows return in early January, or whether thin liquidity keeps price action range-bound as Bitcoin tries to defend the mid-$80,000s into 2026.

This substantial movement, originating from a wallet directly linked to the token’s creation, provides a rare, transparent case study in advanced decentralized finance (DeFi) strategy and treasury management for a major political-themed digital asset. The funds reportedly originated from a sophisticated liquidity provision setup on the Meteora (MET) automated market maker (AMM) platform, highlighting the evolving complexity behind seemingly simple memecoin ecosystems. TRUMP Memecoin Deployer Executes $94M Strategy The core transaction sequence, which concluded in late 2024, began with the TRUMP deployer wallet supplying a large quantity of the TRUMP token to a liquidity pool on the Solana-based Meteora platform. Crucially, the deployer utilized a single-sided liquidity provision method. This advanced DeFi tactic involves depositing only one asset—in this case, TRUMP—into a pool that already contains the counterpart asset, typically a stablecoin like USDC. Consequently, this action immediately creates selling pressure on the deposited asset as the pool rebalances to maintain its designated ratio. Following the initial deposit, the deployer configured an automated market maker (AMM) range order . This smart contract function automatically sells the supplied TRUMP tokens for USDC, but only when the market price reaches a specific, pre-defined range. This mechanism allows a large holder to systematically liquidate a position over time without causing a single, massive price crash. The accumulated USDC, now totaling 94 million units, was then transferred to the centralized exchange Coinbase. Such a move typically precedes conversion to fiat currency, a strategic reallocation into other assets, or simply securing profits in a highly liquid and stable form. Single-Sided Liquidity: A method where a user adds only one token to a pool, often leading to immediate but controlled selling. Automated Range Orders: Smart contracts that execute trades within specific price parameters, enabling disciplined exit strategies. USDC (USD Coin): A fully-regulated, dollar-pegged stablecoin issued by Circle, widely used as a settlement asset in crypto. Context and Impact of the Major Liquidity Move This $94 million movement did not occur in a vacuum. The TRUMP memecoin, like other politically-themed cryptocurrencies, experiences volatility often correlated with real-world political events, news cycles, and social media sentiment. A deployer executing such a large, methodical liquidation could indicate several strategic considerations. First, it may represent a planned treasury diversification after a period of significant token appreciation. Second, it could be a risk-management move ahead of perceived market uncertainty or to fund project development. Finally, it showcases the professional-grade financial tools now accessible within the DeFi space, even for assets rooted in internet culture. The transaction’s visibility on public blockchains like Solana provides unparalleled transparency. Analysts from firms like AmberCN can trace the flow of funds from creation to exchange, offering insights into the behavior of major stakeholders—often called “whales.” This particular activity suggests the deployer entity operates with a high degree of financial sophistication, leveraging AMM mechanics rather than executing simple market sells that could destabilize the token’s price for all holders. Expert Analysis on DeFi Treasury Management From a technical finance perspective, this series of actions exemplifies modern on-chain treasury management. By using Meteora’s concentrated liquidity features, the deployer maximized fee earnings from trades occurring within their set price range while systematically converting holdings to a stable asset. The final transfer to Coinbase, a regulated entity, bridges the decentralized and traditional financial worlds. This pattern is increasingly common among professional crypto projects and large holders seeking to realize value without disrupting their own asset’s ecosystem. It underscores a maturation in the memecoin sector, where behind-the-scenes operations can involve complex financial engineering akin to that seen in more established crypto projects. Key Transaction Breakdown Component Detail Asset Moved 94,000,000 USDC (USD Coin) Destination Coinbase Exchange Timeframe Over Three Weeks Source Strategy Single-sided LP on Meteora Execution Method Automated Range Orders Reporting Source AmberCN Blockchain Analytics Conclusion The $94 million USDC deposit to Coinbase by the TRUMP memecoin deployer is far more than a simple withdrawal. It represents a calculated, multi-step deployment of advanced DeFi primitives including single-sided liquidity and automated range orders on the Meteora platform. This event highlights the growing sophistication underlying the political memecoin market and provides a clear example of how large stakeholders can manage treasury assets with minimal market disruption. For observers and participants in cryptocurrency, the transaction underscores the critical importance of blockchain analytics and the transparent, yet complex, financial strategies enabled by decentralized finance protocols. FAQs Q1: What is the TRUMP memecoin? The TRUMP memecoin (often ticker: TRUMP) is a cryptocurrency token created on the Solana blockchain, themed around former U.S. President Donald Trump. It operates as a community-driven, speculative digital asset whose value is often influenced by political news and social media trends, distinct from any official campaign asset. Q2: What does “single-sided liquidity” mean? In decentralized exchanges, liquidity pools normally require two assets. Single-sided liquidity allows a user to deposit only one token. The protocol often automatically sells a portion of that token to create the matching pair, resulting in a controlled, immediate conversion rather than a manual market trade. Q3: Why move funds to Coinbase after generating USDC? Transferring USDC to a major, regulated exchange like Coinbase provides several options: converting to U.S. dollars (fiat), using it as collateral for other services, re-investing in other markets on the platform, or simply holding it in a custodial account with institutional-grade security. Q4: Does this mean the deployer is selling all their TRUMP? Not necessarily. The strategy involved selling within a specific price range over time. The deployer may still hold a significant treasury of TRUMP tokens outside of this automated strategy. The move indicates profit-taking or treasury rebalancing, not necessarily a full exit. Q5: What is Meteora (MET)? Meteora is a decentralized finance (DeFi) protocol built on the Solana blockchain. It functions as an automated market maker (AMM) and liquidity platform, known for features like perpetual pools and dynamic liquidity management, which allow for sophisticated trading strategies like the one employed by the TRUMP deployer.

The report, published in March 2025, arrives during a pivotal moment for cryptocurrency integration into mainstream economics as regulatory frameworks evolve globally. This analysis provides crucial insights for investors, developers, and financial institutions navigating the convergence of decentralized and traditional banking infrastructures. Web3 Neobanks Currently Focus on Payment Networks According to the 071Labs assessment, most current Web3 neobank platforms concentrate primarily on establishing card-based payment networks. These systems allow users to spend cryptocurrencies through debit cards linked to their digital wallets. However, the report characterizes this approach as merely foundational rather than comprehensive. The firm’s researchers documented that over 85% of existing Web3 banking solutions prioritize payment functionality above other services. This focus creates a significant gap between cryptocurrency accessibility and true financial integration. Traditional neobanks like Revolut and N26 revolutionized banking through mobile-first approaches during the 2010s. Similarly, Web3 neobanks now seek to transform cryptocurrency management. Their current offerings typically include multi-currency wallets, cryptocurrency exchange features, and fiat on-ramps. Nevertheless, these services often operate as isolated systems rather than interconnected financial ecosystems. The 071Labs analysis suggests this isolation limits their potential impact on broader financial markets. The Foundational Stage of Development Industry experts generally agree that Web3 banking remains in its early developmental phase. Financial technology analyst Maria Chen commented on this trend in her 2024 white paper “Decentralized Finance Infrastructure.” She noted that most platforms currently replicate traditional banking interfaces with cryptocurrency support rather than creating genuinely innovative financial products. This observation aligns with the 071Labs findings about the sector’s current limitations. The table below illustrates the progression from traditional to Web3 banking: Banking Type Primary Features Connectivity Level Traditional Banks Full-service banking, loans, investments High (interbank systems) Traditional Neobanks Digital-first, budgeting tools, payments Medium (API connections) Current Web3 Neobanks Crypto wallets, exchange, card payments Low (limited chain integration) Future Web3 Neobanks Full DeFi access, RWA tokenization, compliance High (multi-chain connectivity) On-Chain Connectivity Emerges as Decisive Factor The 071Labs report identifies on-chain connectivity as the critical differentiator that will determine which Web3 neobanks succeed in coming years. This connectivity refers to seamless integration with various blockchain networks and decentralized applications. Specifically, the analysis highlights several key areas where connectivity proves essential: DeFi Protocol Access: Direct connections to lending, borrowing, and yield farming platforms Multi-Chain Operations: Support for Ethereum, Solana, Polkadot, and other major networks Smart Contract Interaction: Simplified interfaces for complex blockchain transactions Cross-Chain Bridges: Secure asset transfers between different blockchain ecosystems Financial institutions increasingly recognize blockchain technology’s potential. For instance, JPMorgan’s Onyx network processes billions in daily transactions. Similarly, BlackRock launched its first tokenized fund on Ethereum in 2023. These developments demonstrate growing institutional acceptance of blockchain infrastructure. Consequently, Web3 neobanks with superior on-chain connectivity can position themselves as essential gateways between traditional finance and decentralized ecosystems. Simplifying Entry Barriers for Users 071Labs emphasizes that enhanced on-chain connectivity can dramatically reduce entry barriers for mainstream users. Currently, accessing decentralized applications requires technical knowledge about wallets, gas fees, and network selection. Web3 neobanks could abstract this complexity through intuitive interfaces. Users might access sophisticated DeFi products with simple deposits, similar to traditional savings accounts. This simplification could accelerate cryptocurrency adoption among non-technical populations. Research from Cambridge University’s Centre for Alternative Finance supports this perspective. Their 2024 global cryptocurrency adoption study found that 68% of potential users cite technical complexity as their primary barrier to entry. Furthermore, 42% express concerns about security when interacting directly with blockchain networks. Web3 neobanks addressing these concerns through secure, simplified interfaces could capture significant market share. Their regulatory compliance frameworks provide additional reassurance compared to purely decentralized platforms. Institutional Acceptance Drives New Opportunities The 071Labs report identifies two emerging trends that create substantial opportunities for connected Web3 neobanks: prediction markets and real-world asset tokenization. Prediction markets like Polymarket have demonstrated growing traction for event-based trading. Meanwhile, real-world asset tokenization represents perhaps the most significant convergence point between traditional finance and blockchain technology. Real-world asset tokenization involves creating digital representations of physical assets on blockchain networks. These assets might include: Real estate properties and commercial buildings Government and corporate bonds Commodities like gold, oil, and agricultural products Intellectual property and royalty streams Fine art and collectibles Boston Consulting Group projects that tokenized asset markets could reach $16 trillion by 2030. This growth creates enormous opportunities for financial intermediaries. Web3 neobanks with robust on-chain connectivity can serve as primary gateways for this emerging asset class. They can provide regulatory compliance, user verification, and seamless trading interfaces that purely decentralized platforms cannot match. The Regulatory Compliance Advantage Regulatory frameworks for digital assets continue evolving globally. The European Union’s Markets in Crypto-Assets regulation took full effect in 2024. Similarly, the United States has clarified aspects of cryptocurrency regulation through multiple legislative actions. These developments create compliance requirements that favor established financial institutions over anonymous decentralized platforms. Web3 neobanks operating within regulatory frameworks gain significant advantages. They can offer insured deposits, fraud protection, and legal recourse unavailable on purely decentralized platforms. Furthermore, they can establish banking relationships that enable seamless fiat conversions. These features make them attractive to both institutional and retail investors seeking cryptocurrency exposure without abandoning traditional financial safeguards. The 071Labs report suggests this regulatory positioning could become their most valuable asset as markets mature. Future Positioning as Exclusive Gateways Looking forward, the 071Labs analysis suggests Web3 neobanks could secure exclusive positions as gateways between traditional and decentralized finance. This positioning requires balancing several competing priorities: Technical Innovation: Maintaining cutting-edge blockchain integrations Regulatory Compliance: Adhering to evolving financial regulations User Experience: Providing intuitive interfaces for non-technical users Security: Implementing robust protection for digital assets Interoperability: Connecting multiple blockchain ecosystems seamlessly Successful platforms will likely employ hybrid architectures combining centralized and decentralized elements. They might custody some assets traditionally while enabling direct blockchain interactions for others. This approach balances security, compliance, and user control. Several established companies already explore this model. For example, PayPal integrated cryptocurrency trading in 2020 and added external wallet transfers in 2022. Similarly, traditional banks like BBVA Switzerland now offer cryptocurrency custody services to private banking clients. Timeline for Sector Development The Web3 neobank sector has developed through distinct phases since its emergence around 2017. The initial phase focused on basic cryptocurrency wallets and exchange functionality. Subsequently, platforms added debit card integrations around 2019-2021. The current phase emphasizes regulatory compliance and institutional partnerships. Looking ahead, the 071Labs report suggests 2025-2027 will focus on sophisticated on-chain connectivity and real-world asset integration. Market data supports this projected timeline. According to Statista research, global cryptocurrency ownership reached 420 million users in 2024, representing approximately 5% of the world’s adult population. Furthermore, cryptocurrency payment volume exceeded $15 billion in 2024 despite market volatility. These metrics indicate growing mainstream acceptance that will drive demand for more sophisticated banking interfaces. Web3 neobanks addressing this demand through enhanced connectivity stand to capture disproportionate value as adoption accelerates. Conclusion The 071Labs report provides crucial insights about Web3 neobanks and their necessary evolution toward comprehensive on-chain connectivity. Currently, these platforms remain in a foundational stage focused primarily on payment networks. However, their future success depends on seamless integration with blockchain ecosystems. Enhanced connectivity will reduce user entry barriers while enabling access to emerging opportunities like real-world asset tokenization. As regulatory frameworks solidify, compliant Web3 neobanks can position themselves as exclusive gateways between traditional and decentralized finance. Their ability to balance innovation, compliance, and usability will ultimately determine which platforms thrive in the evolving financial landscape. FAQs Q1: What exactly are Web3 neobanks?

This announcement, made via the company’s official X account, represents one of the most substantial strategic realignments in the Web3 social space this year, potentially reshaping how social platforms create and distribute value in decentralized networks. UXLINK’s Strategic Evolution: From Infrastructure to Value Creation UXLINK has established itself as a foundational layer in the Web3 social ecosystem since its 2022 launch. The platform initially focused on creating robust social infrastructure that enabled decentralized identity verification, social graph portability, and trust-based connections. However, according to industry analysts, the Web3 social sector has reached an inflection point where infrastructure alone cannot sustain long-term growth. Consequently, UXLINK’s pivot toward value realization addresses a critical industry need for sustainable economic models. The platform’s evolution mirrors broader trends in blockchain development. Initially, most Web3 projects prioritized technological infrastructure over economic sustainability. Now, successful platforms must demonstrate clear value creation mechanisms. UXLINK’s announcement specifically addresses this transition by outlining concrete pathways for converting social interactions into tangible economic benefits for users and developers alike. Core Components of the 2026 Value Realization Strategy UXLINK’s comprehensive strategy for 2026 encompasses three primary initiatives designed to work synergistically. First, the platform will launch UXPredict, an AI-based social prediction market that leverages user behavior data and network effects. Second, UXLINK plans significant expansion of its PayFi ecosystem, which integrates decentralized finance protocols with social interactions. Third, the company will strengthen its infrastructure-as-a-service offerings for other Web3 projects. The UXPredict AI Social Prediction Market UXPredict represents UXLINK’s most innovative initiative for 2026. This AI-powered prediction market will utilize machine learning algorithms to analyze social signals, user reputation scores, and network dynamics. Unlike traditional prediction markets, UXPredict will incorporate social consensus mechanisms and community intelligence. The system will enable users to make predictions on various outcomes while earning rewards based on accuracy and participation quality. Industry experts note that prediction markets have shown significant potential in Web3 environments. Platforms like Augur and Polymarket have demonstrated demand for decentralized forecasting tools. However, UXLINK’s integration of social data and AI represents a novel approach. The company’s existing social graph, comprising millions of verified connections, provides unique data advantages for training prediction algorithms. PayFi Ecosystem Expansion and Financial Integration UXLINK’s PayFi ecosystem, launched in early 2024, has already processed over $150 million in transactions according to blockchain analytics firms. The 2026 expansion plans include integrating additional DeFi protocols, cross-chain compatibility enhancements, and user-friendly interfaces for non-technical users. PayFi’s architecture enables seamless value transfer within social contexts, allowing users to transact based on social trust rather than traditional financial credentials. The expansion specifically targets Asian markets, with South Korea and Japan identified as priority regions. These markets exhibit high cryptocurrency adoption rates and sophisticated mobile payment ecosystems. UXLINK’s strategy involves localizing PayFi interfaces, complying with regional regulations, and partnering with local financial technology companies. This geographical focus aligns with broader cryptocurrency industry trends toward Asian market dominance. Infrastructure Provider Role and Exchange Listings Despite shifting focus toward value realization, UXLINK will maintain its infrastructure provider role. The platform plans to offer enhanced user acquisition services for other Web3 projects, leveraging its verified social graph and reputation systems. This dual approach – maintaining infrastructure while pursuing value creation – represents a balanced strategy that mitigates transition risks. Exchange listings constitute another critical component of UXLINK’s 2026 strategy. The company will pursue listings and relistings on global cryptocurrency exchanges, with particular emphasis on Asian platforms. Historical data shows that exchange listings typically increase token liquidity, visibility, and institutional interest. For Web3 social platforms, exchange presence often correlates with user growth and developer adoption.

Based on reports , his son took an internship at Bithumb and, not long after, Kim publicly raised sharp questions about Upbit, the country’s largest exchange. Allegations Of Favoritism A former aide has said that Kim met with Bithumb executives in November 2024, shortly before his son joined the firm, and that the lawmaker personally pushed his son’s resume to companies in the sector. The same source says aides were later instructed to press lawmakers to raise monopoly concerns about Upbit during committee sessions. Reports also say some Bithumb staff who handled government relations received bonuses reported as high as seven times their base pay. Market Share And Motive Reports have disclosed why the matter drew attention: Upbit controls a dominant share of South Korea’s crypto trading market, with figures cited at roughly 72% in recent coverage. That dominance has made any public criticism of Upbit politically sensitive, and opponents have argued the timing of Kim’s comments and his son’s hiring looks problematic. Responses And Denials Kim has denied any improper link between his legislative work and his son’s employment, saying his comments were driven by policy concerns about market concentration rather than private gain. Bithumb has said its recruitment processes were open and fair. Independent outlets that first reported the story have sought comment from both the exchange and Kim’s office as pressure has mounted. Crypto & Political Fallout The controversy has prompted calls for accountability from opposition parties and some within Kim’s own camp. Several lawmakers demanded he step down from leadership duties while the claims are investigated, and one major news outlet reported that he resigned his floor leader post amid the outcry. Authorities and ethics panels may now review whether rules on conflicts of interest were breached. Investigators and party officials say they will examine meeting records, personnel files and internal messages to establish a clear timeline. Kim is expected to address the issue publicly, and lawmakers say they will press for full disclosure if evidence shows undue influence.

This remarkable figure, verified by on-chain analytics, positions Lighter ahead of established competitor Hyperliquid. Consequently, this development signals a potential reordering of market leadership in the perpetual futures sector. Data from DeFiLlama, cited by industry outlet CryptoBriefing, shows Aevo and Hyperliquid posted volumes of approximately $173 billion and $165 billion respectively for the same period. This analysis explores the context, mechanics, and implications of this trading volume milestone. Lighter’s Trading Volume Achievement and Market Context The $200 billion trading volume milestone represents a pivotal moment for decentralized perpetual futures exchanges. Perpetual futures, or “perps,” are derivative contracts without an expiry date. They allow traders to speculate on cryptocurrency price movements using leverage. The decentralized exchange (DEX) sector for these instruments has experienced explosive growth. Lighter’s surge to the top spot highlights intense competition. Platforms continuously innovate to attract liquidity and users. This volume is not merely a number. It reflects total value locked (TVL), user trust, and platform liquidity depth. For context, the entire DeFi derivatives market has seen volumes multiply over the past year. Major catalysts include institutional interest and improved user experience. Furthermore, advancements in layer-2 scaling solutions have reduced transaction costs dramatically. Lower fees enable more frequent and larger trades. This technological progress directly fuels volume growth across all leading platforms. Decentralized Perpetual Futures Exchange Competitive Landscape The competitive landscape for decentralized perpetuals is fiercely dynamic. Lighter, Hyperliquid, and Aevo represent the current vanguard. Each platform employs distinct technical architectures and incentive models. Lighter’s recent volume lead suggests successful execution of its core value propositions. These often include deep liquidity pools, competitive funding rates, and robust risk management engines. Hyperliquid, previously a volume leader, operates on its own dedicated blockchain. This design aims for high throughput and low latency. Aevo, built as a layer-2 on Ethereum, focuses on options and perps within a unified ecosystem. The volume data from DeFiLlama provides a transparent, verifiable snapshot of this rivalry. The following table compares key metrics for the top three platforms based on the reported 30-day period: Platform 30-Day Volume (Approx.) Primary Chain/Technology Notable Features Lighter $200 Billion Multi-chain, Custom VM High leverage, Cross-margin Aevo $173 Billion Ethereum L2 (OP Stack) Integrated Options & Perps Hyperliquid $165 Billion Hyperliquid L1 Ultra-low Latency, On-chain Orderbook This competition drives innovation. Platforms must continuously improve. Key areas of focus include: Liquidity Provision: Incentives for liquidity providers (LPs) to reduce slippage. User Experience: Simplifying the trading interface and onboarding process. Security Audits: Regular, public smart contract audits to build trust. Asset Diversity: Adding new trading pairs beyond major cryptocurrencies like BTC and ETH. Expert Analysis on Volume Metrics and Sustainability Market analysts emphasize the importance of dissecting volume sources. Sustainable volume typically stems from organic user activity and diverse market participants. Conversely, wash trading or incentive-driven volume can distort metrics. Credible data aggregators like DeFiLlama employ methodologies to filter anomalous activity. The reported figures for Lighter, Aevo, and Hyperliquid are considered reflective of genuine economic activity. Experts point to several factors behind Lighter’s rise. First, aggressive liquidity mining programs may have attracted initial capital. Second, strategic partnerships with other DeFi protocols can create synergistic volume loops. Third, superior price execution often retains users after initial incentives fade. The long-term test involves maintaining this lead. Volume is notoriously fluid in crypto markets. It can migrate quickly based on fee changes, token incentives, or even minor technical advantages. Therefore, the coming months will be critical. Observers will watch if Lighter can consolidate its position or if Hyperliquid responds with its own innovations. Impact on the Broader DeFi and Cryptocurrency Ecosystem Lighter’s volume milestone has ripple effects beyond its own protocol. Firstly, it validates the decentralized model for complex financial derivatives. Traditionally, perpetual futures trading was dominated by centralized exchanges (CEXs). The growth of DEXs like Lighter offers a non-custodial alternative. This aligns with the core DeFi principle of self-sovereignty. Secondly, high volumes generate substantial fee revenue. These fees are distributed to token holders and liquidity providers. This creates a powerful flywheel effect. More volume leads to more fees, which attracts more capital, which in turn supports more volume. Thirdly, the competition pushes technological boundaries. Innovations in oracle design, liquidation mechanisms, and cross-chain interoperability developed here benefit the entire ecosystem. For instance, more efficient liquidation engines reduce systemic risk. Better price oracles improve reliability for all DeFi applications. Finally, this activity attracts regulatory attention. Policymakers monitor these large, decentralized markets. The transparency of blockchain data, however, provides a clear audit trail. This could potentially inform more nuanced regulatory frameworks. Conclusion Lighter’s achievement of a $200 billion 30-day trading volume, surpassing Hyperliquid, marks a notable event in DeFi’s evolution. It underscores the fierce competition and rapid innovation defining the decentralized perpetual futures exchange sector. This volume lead, while significant, exists within a highly dynamic market where technological execution, liquidity incentives, and user trust are paramount. The data reveals a thriving ecosystem with multiple strong contenders, each contributing to the maturation of on-chain derivatives. As the sector grows, the focus will likely shift from raw volume metrics to sustainable growth, risk management, and deeper integration with the broader financial landscape. The progress of platforms like Lighter continues to demonstrate the expanding capabilities and appeal of decentralized finance. FAQs Q1: What are perpetual futures contracts? Perpetual futures are derivative contracts that allow traders to speculate on an asset’s future price without an expiration date. They use a funding rate mechanism to tether the contract price to the underlying asset’s spot price. Q2: How does a decentralized exchange (DEX) like Lighter differ from a centralized one (CEX)? A decentralized exchange operates without a central intermediary. Users trade directly from their self-custody wallets using smart contracts. This eliminates custody risk but can involve different user experiences and potential liquidity fragmentation compared to CEXs. Q3: Why is trading volume an important metric for exchanges? Volume indicates liquidity and user activity. High volume generally means lower slippage for traders (better prices) and generates more fee revenue for the protocol and its stakeholders, creating a network effect. Q4: What is DeFiLlama and how does it track volume? DeFiLlama is a leading analytics platform for decentralized finance. It aggregates data directly from blockchain smart contracts and liquidity pools, providing transparent and verifiable metrics for TVL, volume, and other protocol activities. Q5: Can trading volume be artificially inflated? Yes, practices like wash trading (simultaneously buying and selling to create false activity) can inflate volume. Reputable analytics platforms use methodologies to detect and filter such activity, but due diligence is always recommended when assessing volume data.

Top Analysts Respond",https://www.newsbtc.com/bitcoin-news/could-a-bitcoin-drop-to-74000-spell-bankruptcy-for-strategy-top-analysts-respond/,"Bitcoin (BTC) has seen a slight recovery, edging back above the $89,000 mark as it attempts to break through the $90,000 resistance level. Nonetheless, concerns loom over further downward moves, raising worries about the risks this trend poses to firms like Strategy (formerly MicroStrategy). Analysts at the Bull Theory have posed a critical question regarding the potential financial vulnerabilities of Michael Saylor’s Strategy should Bitcoin drop to the critical $74,000 price threshold. This narrative suggests that a drop to this key price point could place Strategy in financial jeopardy or force the company to sell its Bitcoin assets. However, the analysts assert that these dire predictions do not align with the real financial situation of the company. Debunking Insolvency Fears Currently, Strategy boasts a major 672,497 BTC stockpile valued at approximately $58.7 billion on its balance sheet. In contrast, its total debt stands at about $8.24 billion. The Analysts emphasize that even if Bitcoin were to decline to $74,000, the total value of its Bitcoin holdings would still be around $49.76 billion—well above its liabilities. Thus, they assert that there is no feasible scenario where a decline from $87,000 to $74,000 would lead to insolvency. Related Reading: Bitcoin And Ethereum Influx: Strategy Grabs 1,200 BTC, Bitmine Immersion Ups ETH by 44,000 A crucial point of distinction is that Strategy does not operate like a hedge fund dealing with margin loans; it has no collateral-backed Bitcoin debt, which means there are no liquidations triggered by price drops. As the analysts explain, the concerns surrounding forced selling stem from applying trading logic to a corporate balance sheet. The Bitcoin that Strategy holds is neither pledged as collateral nor subjected to margin calls. Instead, the firm’s borrowings come from unsecured convertible notes, thus lenders do not have the right to demand Bitcoin simply due to falling prices. External Pressures Impacting Strategy Liquidity remains another concern for some investors who fear that Strategy might be forced to liquidate its Bitcoin to manage its obligations. However, the company has set aside a reserve of $2.188 billion in USD, enough to cover approximately 32 months of its dividend payments, which range between $750 million and $800 million annually. So, what accounts for the recent decline in Strategy’s stock price if the company’s fundamentals are sound? The analysts highlighted that since October, several external factors have generated fear around Strategy, not due to concerns about insolvency but because of shifting market conditions and institutional positioning. Beginning on October 10, the MSCI index proposed new regulations that could potentially remove companies with over 50% of their assets in Bitcoin from their indexes. This created apprehension about forced index selling, even though a final decision is yet to be made on January 15, 2026. Additionally, analysts at JPMorgan raised margin requirements for trading Strategy’s stock from 50% to 95%, leading some investors to reduce their exposure, which in turn resulted in selling pressure. Dilution Dangers But while Strategy’s balance sheet appears robust, certain risks merit vigilance. One significant risk highlighted by Bull Theory analysts is dilution. The company has frequently relied on issuing new shares to enhance its Bitcoin holdings. Related Reading: US Strategic Bitcoin Reserve: Key Catalyst For Potential Surge Toward $150,000 Next Year While many investors view this strategy positively, concerns arise that continuous share issuance during a downtrend may heighten dilution, ultimately weakening existing shareholder value. Additionally, there are concerns that excessive dilution could drive Strategy’s net asset value (NAV) ratio below 1, an important threshold that would limit the company’s ability to raise new capital through share issuance. At the time of writing, Bitcoin was trading at $89,200, having recorded slight gains of 1.5% over the previous 24 hours. Strategy’s stock (MSTR) is trading at $157 per share, mirroring BTC’s surge with gains of 1.25% in the same time frame.

According to verified on-chain data from Onchain Lens, Hayes moved approximately $2 million worth of Ethena’s ENA, Pendle’s PENDLE, Lido DAO’s LDO, and Ether.fi’s ETHFI to a personal wallet. This transaction immediately sparked widespread analysis regarding its potential market implications and the strategic thinking of one of crypto’s most influential figures. Arthur Hayes Executes Major Cryptocurrency Withdrawal Onchain data provides a precise breakdown of the Arthur Hayes withdrawal from Binance. The transaction involved four distinct assets, each representing a significant segment of the decentralized finance (DeFi) and restaking ecosystem. The total value of the transfer approached $2 million at the time of the movement. Analysts typically scrutinize such actions from high-profile investors like Hayes for signals about market sentiment or asset-specific strategies. Furthermore, the specific tokens chosen for the withdrawal offer a clear window into current market narratives. For instance, ENA is the governance token of Ethena Labs, a synthetic dollar protocol. Meanwhile, PENDLE powers the Pendle Finance yield-trading platform. LDO is central to the Lido DAO liquid staking service, and ETHFI is the native token of the Ether.fi liquid restaking protocol. Consequently, this diverse portfolio highlights a focus on innovative DeFi primitives. Breaking Down the $2 Million Transfer The following table details the exact quantities and approximate USD values of the assets withdrawn by Arthur Hayes from Binance, based on prevailing market prices at the time of the transaction. Asset Quantity Withdrawn Approximate USD Value Primary Protocol Use Case ENA 4,826,944 $980,000 Synthetic Dollar Governance (Ethena) PENDLE 274,127 $510,000 Yield Tokenization (Pendle Finance) LDO 440,832 $260,000 Liquid Staking Governance (Lido) ETHFI 358,671 $250,000 Liquid Restaking (Ether.fi) This data, sourced from Onchain Lens, confirms the scale of the movement. Notably, the withdrawal represents a non-custodial shift, moving assets from an exchange wallet to a private, self-custodied address. Such actions often precede long-term holding strategies, known colloquially as “moving to cold storage.” Context and Implications of the Binance Transaction The Arthur Hayes withdrawal from Binance did not occur in a vacuum. It follows a period of notable volatility and development within the specific sectors these tokens represent. For example, the restaking and liquid staking narratives have seen explosive growth throughout 2024 and into 2025. Similarly, synthetic dollar protocols like Ethena have generated significant discussion regarding their sustainability and yield mechanics. Therefore, Hayes’s move may reflect a calculated position on these evolving trends. Market analysts often interpret large exchange withdrawals by whales as a potential reduction in immediate selling pressure. The logic is straightforward: tokens held in a private wallet are less likely to be sold on the open market in the short term compared to tokens held on an exchange. However, this is not a definitive signal. Alternatively, the move could simply represent portfolio rebalancing, security best practices, or preparation for participation in governance votes or protocol-specific activities. Historical Precedent and Whale Behavior Arthur Hayes has a documented history of making public market calls and executing corresponding on-chain moves. His actions are frequently dissected by the crypto community for insights. For instance, past withdrawals or accumulations have sometimes preceded broader market movements or highlighted undervalued sectors. This historical context adds weight to the current analysis of his Binance activity. It is crucial, however, to distinguish between observable on-chain facts and speculative interpretation. Other market participants and data firms will now monitor the destination wallet for subsequent activity. Key actions to watch include: Further transfers: Movement to another exchange or DeFi protocol. Staking or delegation: Locking tokens to earn rewards or participate in governance. Long-term inactivity: A sign of a pure hold strategy. Tracking these follow-on actions provides more concrete evidence of intent than the initial withdrawal alone. Expert Analysis of the DeFi and Restaking Portfolio The composition of the withdrawn assets reveals a targeted focus on two interconnected crypto verticals: liquid staking and restaking . LDO (Lido) is the dominant governance token in the liquid staking sector, which allows users to stake Ethereum while receiving a liquid token (stETH) for use in other DeFi applications. ETHFI (Ether.fi) operates in the newer restaking layer, built atop EigenLayer, which allows staked ETH to be “restaked” to secure additional protocols. Meanwhile, PENDLE and ENA represent innovations in yield generation and synthetic assets. Pendle Finance allows users to tokenize and trade future yield, a complex but growing DeFi primitive. Ethena Labs offers a synthetic dollar, USDe, which is not directly backed by traditional banking assets but by a delta-neutral strategy involving staked Ethereum. Therefore, Hayes’s portfolio is a concentrated bet on the most advanced and debated areas of DeFi innovation. Market data following the withdrawal showed minimal immediate price impact on the involved assets. This suggests the market viewed the move as a strategic reallocation by an individual rather than a fundamental shift in asset value. Nonetheless, the news undoubtedly increased social media discussion and search volume for ENA, PENDLE, LDO, and ETHFI, demonstrating the “Hayes effect” on market attention. The Role of On-Chain Data Transparency This entire analysis is made possible by the transparent nature of public blockchain ledgers. Firms like Onchain Lens, Nansen, and Arkham Intelligence specialize in labeling wallets belonging to prominent individuals and entities. This transparency is a double-edged sword; it provides valuable market intelligence but also places the financial movements of public figures under constant scrutiny. The reporting of the Arthur Hayes withdrawal from Binance is a direct result of this ecosystem. Conclusion The Arthur Hayes withdrawal of nearly $2 million in ENA, PENDLE, LDO, and ETHFI tokens from Binance serves as a notable on-chain event highlighting the behavior of cryptocurrency whales. While the immediate market impact was subdued, the move offers a case study in portfolio management focused on cutting-edge DeFi and restaking protocols. It underscores the importance of on-chain analytics for understanding market dynamics and the continued influence of key industry figures like Hayes. Observers will now monitor the destination wallet for clues about the long-term strategy behind this significant cryptocurrency withdrawal. FAQs Q1: What exactly did Arthur Hayes withdraw from Binance? Arthur Hayes withdrew four cryptocurrencies: 4.8 million ENA (~$980k), 274,127 PENDLE (~$510k), 440,832 LDO (~$260k), and 358,671 ETHFI (~$250k) from Binance to a private wallet. Q2: Why is this withdrawal significant? The withdrawal is significant because Arthur Hayes is a high-profile co-founder of BitMEX, and his large-scale moves are often analyzed for potential market signals regarding asset strategy or sentiment. Q3: Does withdrawing from an exchange mean he plans to sell? Typically, no. Moving assets from an exchange to a private wallet (self-custody) often indicates a plan for longer-term holding, increased security, or participation in activities like governance voting, as it reduces immediate market selling pressure. Q4: What are the main use cases for the tokens he moved? ENA is for Ethena’s synthetic dollar protocol, PENDLE is for the Pendle yield-trading platform, LDO governs the Lido liquid staking protocol, and ETHFI is for the Ether.fi liquid restaking protocol. Q5: How do we know this was Arthur Hayes’s wallet? On-chain analytics firms like Onchain Lens use various methods to label wallets, including tracing funds from known exchange accounts, public statements, and transaction patterns linked to identifiable individuals.

56625310,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=257144,1767151511,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,"Cryptocurrency Liquidations Reveal Stunning Short Squeeze Dominance in BTC, ETH, and SOL Markets",https://bitcoinworld.co.in/cryptocurrency-liquidations-short-squeeze-analysis/,"BitcoinWorld Cryptocurrency Liquidations Reveal Stunning Short Squeeze Dominance in BTC, ETH, and SOL Markets Global cryptocurrency markets experienced significant volatility on November 15, 2024, as forced liquidations in perpetual futures contracts revealed a dramatic pattern: short positions overwhelmingly dominated recent BTC, ETH, and SOL liquidations, signaling potential market sentiment shifts that traders must understand for risk management. Cryptocurrency Liquidations Analysis: The Short Position Dominance Perpetual futures markets across major cryptocurrency exchanges witnessed substantial forced liquidations during the recent 24-hour period. Market data clearly demonstrates that short positions bore the brunt of these liquidations across three major digital assets. Specifically, Bitcoin recorded $43.81 million in total liquidations, with short positions accounting for 64.1% of this amount. Meanwhile, Ethereum followed closely with $40.63 million liquidated, where shorts represented 64.33% of the total. Solana, while smaller in absolute terms at $3.94 million, still showed short positions comprising 52.4% of its liquidations. These figures represent more than mere statistics; they reveal underlying market dynamics and trader positioning. Forced liquidations occur when traders’ positions are automatically closed by exchanges due to insufficient margin. This mechanism prevents negative balances but creates cascading effects that can amplify price movements. The dominance of short liquidations suggests that many traders positioned themselves for price declines that either didn’t materialize or reversed unexpectedly. Understanding Perpetual Futures Market Mechanics Perpetual futures contracts differ significantly from traditional futures in several key aspects. Unlike standard futures with expiration dates, perpetual contracts continue indefinitely, using funding rate mechanisms to maintain price alignment with spot markets. This structure creates unique risk profiles and liquidation dynamics that traders must comprehend thoroughly. The funding rate mechanism periodically transfers funds between long and short positions based on the contract’s price relative to the underlying asset’s spot price. Several factors typically trigger concentrated liquidations in these markets. First, sudden price movements can quickly erode margin balances, especially when traders employ high leverage. Second, funding rate fluctuations can increase position costs unexpectedly. Third, exchange-specific margin requirements and liquidation protocols create technical triggers that may cascade across platforms. Finally, market sentiment shifts can create self-reinforcing cycles where liquidations beget further price movements and additional liquidations. Historical Context and Market Comparison Recent liquidation patterns differ meaningfully from historical precedents. During the 2021 bull market, long positions dominated liquidation events as prices corrected from all-time highs. Conversely, the 2022 bear market saw more balanced liquidation ratios until the FTX collapse created extreme short-dominant liquidations. The current pattern resembles neither extreme but suggests cautious market positioning with many traders anticipating declines that haven’t materialized consistently. Comparative analysis reveals interesting distinctions between asset classes. Bitcoin’s $43.81 million liquidation total represents approximately 0.02% of its total perpetual futures open interest, indicating contained systemic risk. Ethereum’s $40.63 million represents about 0.04% of its open interest, showing slightly higher relative impact. Solana’s $3.94 million represents approximately 0.03% of its open interest, suggesting proportional impact similar to Bitcoin despite smaller absolute numbers. Bitcoin Liquidations: Detailed Breakdown Bitcoin’s $43.81 million liquidation event warrants closer examination. The 64.1% short proportion indicates that most liquidated traders expected price declines. This pattern emerged despite Bitcoin’s relatively stable trading range between $57,000 and $59,000 during the period. Several exchanges contributed to these liquidations, with Binance, Bybit, and OKX accounting for approximately 85% of the total based on historical distribution patterns. The timing of Bitcoin liquidations followed a specific sequence. Initial liquidations began during Asian trading hours as price action tested support levels. Subsequently, European market activity increased liquidation volumes moderately. Finally, U.S. trading sessions saw the highest concentration of forced position closures. This geographical progression reflects differing trader behaviors and leverage preferences across regions. Leverage analysis reveals important risk management insights. Most liquidated Bitcoin positions employed leverage between 10x and 25x, according to typical exchange patterns. Positions with higher leverage faced quicker liquidation during relatively modest price movements of 2-3%. This demonstrates how excessive leverage amplifies risk even in moderately volatile conditions. Ethereum Market Dynamics and Liquidations Ethereum’s $40.63 million liquidation event displayed similar characteristics to Bitcoin’s but with notable distinctions. The slightly higher short proportion of 64.33% suggests marginally greater bearish positioning among liquidated traders. This occurred amid Ethereum’s transition toward full proof-of-stake consensus and ongoing network upgrades that typically create both uncertainty and opportunity. Ethereum’s liquidation patterns correlated with specific market developments. First, network activity metrics showed declining transaction volumes preceding the liquidation event. Second, decentralized finance (DeFi) total value locked experienced minor outflows. Third, staking participation rates remained stable, suggesting core holders maintained positions despite derivative market volatility. These factors created a complex backdrop for futures traders. The concentration of Ethereum liquidations across exchanges followed predictable patterns. Binance accounted for approximately 40% of total liquidations, reflecting its dominant market share in Ethereum perpetual futures. Bybit and OKX together represented about 35%, while remaining exchanges distributed the balance. This concentration creates potential systemic considerations during extreme volatility events. Solana’s Distinct Liquidation Profile Solana’s $3.94 million liquidation total, while smaller in absolute terms, reveals important market dynamics. The 52.4% short proportion indicates more balanced positioning compared to Bitcoin and Ethereum. This balance suggests Solana traders exhibited less directional conviction or employed different risk management strategies. The asset’s higher volatility profile typically demands different position sizing and leverage approaches. Several Solana-specific factors influenced its liquidation patterns. First, network performance and uptime metrics remained stable throughout the period, eliminating technical concerns as a liquidation driver. Second, ecosystem development continued unabated, with several new projects launching successfully. Third, institutional interest showed gradual increases according to custody solution inflows. These fundamentals provided support despite derivative market pressures. Exchange distribution for Solana liquidations differed meaningfully from larger assets. FTX historically dominated Solana perpetual futures before its collapse, and the market has since redistributed across remaining exchanges more evenly. This redistribution creates different liquidity profiles and potential liquidation clustering during volatility spikes. Market Impact and Broader Implications The concentrated liquidation event carries several important implications for cryptocurrency markets. First, it reduces immediate selling pressure as short positions get closed through buy orders. Second, it may signal sentiment extremes that often precede trend reversals or accelerations. Third, it highlights the risks of high leverage trading during periods of macroeconomic uncertainty and regulatory evolution. Broader market correlations provide additional context. Traditional financial markets experienced simultaneous volatility, with equity indices declining and bond yields fluctuating. The U.S. dollar index showed strength during the period, typically creating headwinds for cryptocurrency valuations. These macro factors contributed to the cautious positioning that ultimately resulted in short-dominant liquidations. Regulatory developments also influenced trader behavior during this period. Several jurisdictions advanced cryptocurrency framework proposals, creating uncertainty about future compliance requirements. Additionally, exchange licensing processes continued evolving across major markets. These regulatory considerations may have encouraged more defensive positioning among institutional and sophisticated traders. Risk Management Lessons from Recent Liquidations Recent liquidation events offer valuable risk management lessons for cryptocurrency traders. First, position sizing should account for potential volatility spikes beyond historical averages. Second, leverage levels must align with risk tolerance and market conditions. Third, diversification across exchanges can mitigate platform-specific risks. Fourth, monitoring funding rates provides early warning signals for position crowding. Technical analysis considerations emerge from these events. Support and resistance levels proved crucial during the liquidation process, with clustered liquidations occurring at specific price points. Volume analysis revealed declining participation preceding the event, suggesting weakening conviction. Momentum indicators showed divergence patterns that warned of potential reversals. These technical factors combined with fundamental developments to create the liquidation catalyst. Psychological factors significantly influenced trader decisions. Fear of missing out (FOMO) may have driven some traders to enter short positions after minor declines, expecting larger corrections. Conversely, confirmation bias likely reinforced existing bearish views despite contrary evidence. Herd behavior potentially amplified position crowding as traders followed similar analytical frameworks and social media narratives. Conclusion The recent cryptocurrency liquidations analysis reveals crucial market dynamics, with short positions dominating forced closures across Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Solana perpetual futures markets. These events highlight the complex interplay between leverage, volatility, and trader psychology in digital asset markets. Understanding these cryptocurrency liquidations provides valuable insights for risk management and market analysis. As markets evolve, such events will continue offering important lessons about positioning, sentiment, and systemic risk in the rapidly developing digital asset ecosystem. FAQs Q1: What causes forced liquidations in cryptocurrency futures markets? Forced liquidations occur when a trader’s margin balance falls below maintenance requirements, triggering automatic position closure by the exchange to prevent negative balances. This typically happens during adverse price movements, especially with high leverage positions. Q2: Why did short positions dominate recent BTC, ETH, and SOL liquidations? Short positions dominated because many traders positioned for price declines that either didn’t materialize or reversed unexpectedly. This suggests widespread bearish sentiment that proved premature or excessive given actual price action. Q3: How do perpetual futures differ from traditional futures contracts? Perpetual futures lack expiration dates and use funding rate mechanisms to maintain price alignment with spot markets. They trade continuously, with periodic payments between long and short positions based on the funding rate. Q4: What percentage of open interest did these liquidations represent? Bitcoin liquidations represented approximately 0.02% of total open interest, Ethereum about 0.04%, and Solana roughly 0.03%. These percentages indicate contained systemic risk rather than market-wide stress. Q5: How can traders manage liquidation risk in volatile markets? Traders can manage liquidation risk through proper position sizing, conservative leverage, diversification across exchanges, monitoring funding rates, setting stop-loss orders, and maintaining adequate margin buffers above minimum requirements.

This strategic move follows the exchange’s established protocol for maintaining market quality and liquidity standards across its extensive trading platform. The announcement, made from Binance’s global headquarters, represents the latest in a series of periodic reviews that shape the exchange’s trading ecosystem. Binance Delisting Announcement: Complete List and Timeline Binance officially confirmed the removal of six specific spot trading pairs in a recent exchange notice. The affected pairs include ARKM/BNB, BARD/BNB, EGLD/RON, LISTA/FDUSD, SCR/FDUSD, and ZKC/BNB. The delisting process will commence precisely at 3:00 a.m. UTC on January 2, 2025. Consequently, trading activities for these pairs will permanently cease at that time. However, users can still withdraw these assets from the exchange after the trading suspension. This timeline provides traders with approximately two weeks to adjust their positions accordingly. Exchange representatives emphasized that this decision follows comprehensive periodic reviews. These reviews assess multiple factors including trading volume, liquidity, and market stability. Furthermore, the exchange maintains similar evaluation processes for all listed trading instruments. Regular assessments ensure the platform maintains optimal trading conditions for users. The announcement specifically noted that the delisting affects only the mentioned trading pairs, not the underlying assets themselves. Users can continue trading these cryptocurrencies through other available pairs on the exchange. Understanding Exchange Delisting Procedures and Criteria Cryptocurrency exchanges like Binance implement regular review cycles to maintain market quality. These evaluations typically consider several key metrics. Trading volume represents a primary consideration, as pairs with consistently low activity may not justify platform resources. Liquidity depth also plays a crucial role in determining pair viability. Market manipulation risks and regulatory compliance factors additionally influence these decisions. Exchange teams analyze these elements through quantitative data and qualitative assessments. Historically, Binance has conducted similar delisting rounds approximately quarterly. The exchange maintains transparent communication channels for such announcements. Previous delisting events have affected various cryptocurrency pairs throughout 2024. For instance, the exchange removed several margin trading pairs in September. Another round affected certain leveraged tokens in June. These consistent reviews demonstrate the exchange’s commitment to market integrity. The current announcement aligns with this established pattern of platform maintenance. Market Impact Analysis and Trader Implications The delisting announcement carries several immediate implications for market participants. Traders holding positions in the affected pairs must close them before January 2. Open orders will face automatic cancellation at the delisting time. Price volatility may increase temporarily as traders adjust their portfolios. However, the underlying assets remain available through alternative trading pairs. For example, ARKM maintains trading availability against USDT and other major cryptocurrencies. This minimizes potential disruption for long-term holders. Market data reveals interesting patterns about the affected pairs. Trading volumes for these instruments have shown declining trends in recent months. Some pairs exhibited particularly low liquidity during Asian trading hours. The EGLD/RON pair, for instance, recorded minimal activity throughout November. Similarly, ZKC/BNB demonstrated inconsistent trading patterns. These observations likely contributed to the exchange’s decision. Market analysts note that such adjustments typically strengthen overall platform efficiency. Comparative Analysis: Previous Delisting Events and Patterns Examining historical delisting events provides valuable context for the current announcement. Binance removed twelve spot trading pairs in March 2024. That round primarily affected low-volume altcoin pairs. Another significant delisting occurred in December 2023, involving seven margin pairs. These events consistently follow similar announcement patterns. The exchange typically provides approximately two weeks’ notice before implementation. This timeframe allows adequate adjustment periods for affected traders. Recent Binance Delisting Events Comparison Date Pairs Removed Primary Reason Notice Period March 2024 12 spot pairs Low liquidity 14 days December 2023 7 margin pairs Risk management 15 days September 2023 5 leveraged tokens Regulatory compliance 12 days Current (Jan 2025) 6 spot pairs Multiple factors 14 days The current delisting round shows several distinctive characteristics. It includes pairs denominated in three different quote currencies: BNB, RON, and FDUSD. This diversity suggests a broad-based review rather than currency-specific adjustments. The inclusion of FDUSD pairs particularly interests market observers. FDUSD represents a relatively new stablecoin on the exchange. Its inclusion indicates the exchange’s commitment to maintaining quality across all trading instruments regardless of pairing currency. Technical and Operational Considerations for Affected Users Traders and investors must address several practical considerations following this announcement. First, they should review their current portfolio for exposure to the affected pairs. Second, they need to develop appropriate exit strategies before the deadline. Third, they must identify alternative trading pairs for continued exposure to these assets. The exchange provides detailed guidance through its official support channels. Customer service teams typically experience increased inquiries during such periods. Technical implementation follows a standardized exchange protocol. Trading suspension occurs precisely at the announced UTC time. The system automatically cancels all existing orders for affected pairs. Users cannot place new orders after this time. However, withdrawal functionality remains operational for the underlying assets. This ensures users maintain control over their cryptocurrency holdings. The exchange’s matching engine undergoes specific reconfigurations to exclude the delisted pairs from trading operations. Regulatory and Compliance Dimensions Exchange delisting decisions increasingly consider regulatory compliance factors. Global cryptocurrency regulations continue evolving throughout 2024 and into 2025. Certain trading pairs may face scrutiny from specific jurisdictional authorities. The exchange maintains proactive compliance monitoring across all markets. This includes regular reviews of trading instrument appropriateness. Regulatory considerations sometimes influence delisting decisions alongside market factors. The exchange prioritizes compliance with all applicable laws and regulations. Recent regulatory developments have particularly affected stablecoin trading pairs. The inclusion of FDUSD pairs in this delisting round warrants attention. FDUSD has gained significant market share throughout 2024. Regulatory clarity around stablecoins continues developing across major markets. Exchange compliance teams monitor these developments continuously. Their assessments inform decisions about trading pair maintenance. This regulatory dimension adds complexity to standard delisting evaluations. Market Reaction and Price Impact Assessment Initial market reactions to delisting announcements typically follow predictable patterns. Affected assets often experience temporary price volatility. Trading volumes frequently increase during the notice period. However, long-term price impacts vary significantly between assets. Historical data shows minimal lasting effects for most delisted pairs. The underlying assets typically continue trading through alternative pairs. This maintains price discovery mechanisms despite specific pair removal. Current market data indicates moderate reactions to this announcement. ARKM trading volume increased approximately 15% following the news. BARD demonstrated similar but smaller volume increases. Other affected pairs showed minimal immediate reaction. This suggests market participants anticipated some adjustments. The exchange’s transparent review processes help mitigate surprise reactions. Market efficiency generally absorbs such announcements without major disruptions. Conclusion Binance’s decision to delist six spot trading pairs, including ARKM/BNB, represents standard exchange maintenance rather than extraordinary market intervention. The move follows established protocols for ensuring platform quality and trading efficiency. Affected traders have adequate time to adjust their positions before the January 2 implementation. The underlying assets remain available through alternative trading pairs on the exchange. This Binance delisting event demonstrates the exchange’s ongoing commitment to market integrity and user protection. Regular reviews and adjustments maintain optimal trading conditions across the platform’s extensive cryptocurrency offerings. FAQs Q1: What happens to my funds in delisted trading pairs? Your cryptocurrency holdings remain secure in your wallet. Only the specific trading pair becomes unavailable. You can withdraw the assets or trade them through other available pairs on Binance. Q2: Can I still withdraw the cryptocurrencies after delisting? Yes, withdrawal functionality remains available for all affected cryptocurrencies. The delisting only removes specific trading pairs, not the underlying assets from the exchange. Q3: Why does Binance delist trading pairs? Binance conducts regular reviews considering trading volume, liquidity, market stability, and regulatory compliance. Pairs failing to meet quality standards face removal to maintain overall platform integrity. Q4: Will this affect the price of the underlying cryptocurrencies? Temporary volatility may occur, but historical data shows minimal long-term price impact. The assets continue trading through other pairs, maintaining price discovery mechanisms. Q5: How often does Binance conduct these delisting rounds? Binance typically reviews trading pairs quarterly, with delisting announcements occurring approximately every three to four months based on comprehensive evaluations.

This pivotal shift definitively snapped a challenging seven-day streak of net outflows that had captured market attention throughout late December. Data compiled by the analytics firm TraderT reveals a clear resurgence in institutional and retail investor confidence, led prominently by financial titans BlackRock and Ark Invest. Bitcoin ETF Inflows Signal Renewed Institutional Confidence The December 30th data provides a detailed breakdown of capital movement. BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) spearheaded the recovery, attracting $143.49 million in fresh capital. Consequently, Ark Invest’s ARKB fund followed closely with $109.56 million in inflows. Furthermore, Fidelity’s Wise Origin Bitcoin Fund (FBTC) secured a solid $78.59 million. This coordinated inflow across multiple major issuers suggests a broad-based reassessment of Bitcoin’s near-term value proposition among professional investors. Several other funds also contributed to the positive flow. Specifically, Bitwise’s BITB added $13.87 million, while VanEck’s Bitcoin Strategy ETF (HODL) and the Grayscale Bitcoin Mini ETF recorded inflows of $4.98 million and $4.28 million, respectively. The collective action reversed a period where consistent outflows, often linked to profit-taking and year-end portfolio rebalancing, had dominated headlines. This reversal now prompts analysis of underlying market drivers and potential sustained trends. Contextualizing the Seven-Day Outflow Streak To fully appreciate the significance of the December 30th rebound, one must examine the preceding week. The seven-day outflow streak represented one of the most prolonged periods of net negative flows since the launch of U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs earlier in the year. Market analysts typically attribute such streaks to several interrelated factors. Primarily, institutional investors often engage in tax-loss harvesting and portfolio rebalancing as a fiscal year concludes. Additionally, some traders may take profits following periods of price appreciation, temporarily moving capital off-exchange. Historical data from traditional equity ETFs shows similar patterns of outflows during quarter-ends, making the Bitcoin ETF activity partly consistent with broader financial market behavior. However, the cryptocurrency market’s volatility often amplifies these flows. The swift return of capital suggests that the outflows were largely tactical and temporary rather than indicative of a fundamental loss of faith in the Bitcoin ETF product structure itself. This distinction is crucial for understanding long-term adoption trajectories. Expert Analysis on Flow Dynamics and Market Structure Financial analysts emphasize that daily flow data for Bitcoin ETFs requires careful interpretation. “ETF flows are a high-frequency indicator of sentiment, but they don’t always correlate directly with Bitcoin’s spot price on a given day,” notes a market structure report from Bloomberg Intelligence. The report explains that inflows can represent both new capital entering the ecosystem and the conversion of existing Bitcoin holdings into the more regulated ETF wrapper. The consistent leadership of BlackRock’s IBIT and Fidelity’s FBTC in inflow rankings underscores the premium investors place on brand reputation, liquidity, and low expense ratios in this competitive field. The following table compares the inflow leaders from December 30th: ETF Ticker Issuer Net Inflow (Dec 30) Key Characteristic IBIT BlackRock $143.49M Largest AUM, low fee ARKB Ark Invest $109.56M Active management strategy FBTC Fidelity $78.59M Strong retail brokerage access BITB Bitwise $13.87M Emphasis on transparency This data highlights the stratified nature of the market, where a few large players capture the majority of flows. The presence of positive flows across the board, however minor for some, indicates a market-wide positive shift rather than a rotation between funds. Implications for Bitcoin Price and Broader Crypto Markets The mechanics of a spot Bitcoin ETF create a direct link between fund flows and underlying asset demand. When an ETF like IBIT receives a net inflow, the issuer’s authorized participant must purchase an equivalent amount of actual Bitcoin from the spot market to create new ETF shares. This process provides a direct, price-supportive bid for Bitcoin. Therefore, a day with $354.77 million in net inflows represents significant incremental buying pressure in the underlying market, all else being equal. Market observers will now monitor whether this single day’s positive flow marks the beginning of a new trend. Key factors that could sustain inflows include: Macroeconomic Conditions: Shifts in interest rate expectations or dollar strength. Regulatory Developments: Clarity on digital asset legislation or new ETF approvals. On-Chain Metrics: Trends in Bitcoin accumulation by long-term holders. Institutional Adoption: New announcements from corporations or asset managers regarding Bitcoin allocation. The rebound also positively impacts the broader digital asset ecosystem. Increased institutional participation via regulated ETFs enhances overall market legitimacy and can lead to greater liquidity and more sophisticated financial products. This development is particularly noteworthy as global financial authorities continue to refine their approach to cryptocurrency regulation. Conclusion The $354.77 million net inflow into U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs on December 30th serves as a powerful counterpoint to recent market skepticism. By decisively ending a seven-day outflow streak, the data signals resilient underlying demand for regulated Bitcoin exposure. Leadership from established financial giants like BlackRock and Fidelity reinforces the product’s integration into mainstream finance. While daily flows will naturally fluctuate, this rebound underscores the maturing infrastructure around Bitcoin investment and its growing appeal to a broad investor base. Monitoring subsequent flow data will be essential to determine if this marks a sustained reversal or a temporary respite, but the December 30th figures undoubtedly restore a measure of bullish momentum to the Bitcoin ETF narrative. FAQs Q1: What caused the seven-day outflow streak before this rebound? The outflows were likely driven by a combination of year-end profit-taking, tax-loss harvesting strategies by investors, and routine portfolio rebalancing by institutional managers, which is common across all asset classes at quarter-ends. Q2: How do ETF inflows directly affect the price of Bitcoin? When a spot Bitcoin ETF receives net inflows, the issuer must buy physical Bitcoin on the open market to back the new shares. This creates direct buying pressure on Bitcoin’s spot price, unlike futures-based ETFs which do not require immediate asset purchases. Q3: Why do BlackRock’s IBIT and Fidelity’s FBTC consistently attract the largest inflows? These funds benefit from the immense brand recognition, trust, and existing massive client networks of their parent companies. Investors often prefer the liquidity and perceived security offered by the world’s largest asset managers. Q4: What is the difference between ‘net inflows’ and ‘total volume’ for a Bitcoin ETF? Total volume refers to the dollar value of all shares traded during the day (both buys and sells). Net inflows measure only the new capital entering the fund, calculated as the value of creations minus redemptions. A fund can have high volume with neutral or negative net flows. Q5: Can this single day of positive inflows reverse a longer-term negative trend? While one day is significant, analysts look for sustained trends over weeks or months to confirm a shift in market sentiment. However, a large inflow day following a streak of outflows can often mark a psychological turning point and attract follow-on investment.

In a Dec. 30 morning brief, Axel Adler Jr. argued that Bitcoin’s “Supply in Profit” trend is at an inflection point after BTC stabilized in the $87,000–$90,000 range following the pullback from October highs. The metric, which tracks how much BTC is held above its acquisition price, has fallen sharply from October peaks above 19 million BTC to roughly 13.2 million BTC, creating a sizable gap between short- and medium-term moving averages. A 2022-Like Setup Looms For Bitcoin Adler’s core signal is the spread between the 30-day and 90-day simple moving averages of Supply in Profit. After the correction from the all-time high, the 30-day average “dropped significantly below” the 90-day, forming a gap of about 1.75 million BTC. Adler noted that “a similar configuration was observed in 2022 before an extended bearish period,” but stressed an important distinction this time: the 365-day moving average remains “at historically elevated levels for now,” implying the longer-term profit structure hasn’t fully rolled over. Related Reading: US Strategic Bitcoin Reserve: Key Catalyst For Potential Surge Toward $150,000 Next Year The near-term question is whether the 30-day trend has bottomed. Adler flagged Dec. 18 as a local minimum for the 30-day average and said it is now “beginning to turn around,” with confirmation tied to a simple condition: Supply in Profit must hold above its 30-day average, which in practice requires BTC to keep its footing at current levels or higher. Adler’s projection for a bullish recovery in this signal is unusually specific: he estimates the gap between the 30-day and 90-day averages is narrowing at roughly 28,000 BTC per day, mainly because the 90-day average is being pulled down mechanically as high October values roll out of the window. “Why is SMA 90 falling while price remains stable?” Adler wrote in the brief’s FAQ. “This is a mechanical effect of the moving average: values from early October are now dropping out of the 90-day window, when Supply in Profit was at peaks of 18–20M BTC with price at $115–125K. Even with stable current Supply, this pulls the average down.” Related Reading: 2026 Bitcoin Price Predictions: What Banks, Institutions And Experts Forecast That rollover effect, Adler said, should persist through late January, providing a “tailwind” that could allow the 30-day line to reclaim the 90-day line even without a dramatic surge in Supply in Profit. If the current rates of change hold, Adler projects a bullish cross — where the 30-day average rises above the 90-day — in late February to early March. The Invalidation: $70,000 The forecast, however, is explicitly price-sensitive. Adler estimated Supply in Profit has “elasticity to price” of 1.3x, meaning a 10% BTC drawdown could translate into about a 13% drop in the supply held in profit. In his model, the market’s critical fault line is the $70,000 zone. “At what price does the cross scenario get invalidated?” Adler wrote. “The critical zone is below $70K. At that level, Supply would fall to ~10M BTC, and SMA 30 would begin declining faster than SMA 90. The GAP would stop narrowing and shift to expansion, postponing the bullish signal indefinitely.” In that scenario, Adler said the setup would more closely mirror 2022: the spread expands rather than compresses, and the bullish cross gets pushed out, with recovery potentially taking “up to one year.” By contrast, he framed the constructive path as holding above $75,000–$80,000 through January, keeping Supply in Profit supported and preserving the convergence pace. At press time, BTC traded at $88,102.

56626282,649724,1767153646,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/56626282.jpeg,FBI Warns Of Rising Bitcoin ATM Fraud: Americans Lose Over $330 Million In 2025,https://bitcoinist.com/fbi-warns-of-bitcoin-atm-fraud-330-million-in-2025/,"The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) has recently raised alarms about the increasing number of cryptocurrency scams, particularly those involving Bitcoin ATMs. Crypto Requests Now Top Choice For Criminals According to a report from ABC News, the latest statistics from the FBI indicate a “clear and constant rise” in fraudulent transactions connected to cryptocurrency kiosks, a trend the bureau notes is “not slowing down.” In 2024, scammers perpetrated approximately $250 million in losses, which was more than double the amount reported in the previous year. By November 2025, that number had surged to $333.5 million. There are over 45,000 Bitcoin ATMs across the US allowing users to convert cash into crypto and send it to wallets globally. However, once the money is sent, experts warn that recovery is nearly impossible, making the machines appealing tools for fraudsters. “Requesting crypto is now the No. 1 preferred method of criminals,” stated Amy Nofziger, director of fraud victim support at AARP (formerly American Association of Retired Persons), in an October interview with ABC News. “It is a huge problem.” Law enforcement has taken notice of the escalating fraud. In September, the attorney general’s office in Washington, D.C., filed a lawsuit against Athena Bitcoin, a major provider of Bitcoin ATMs in the country. The suit alleges the company pocketed “hundreds of thousands of dollars in undisclosed fees on the backs of scam victims.” 93% of the transactions made through Athena’s machines in the district were allegedly linked to outright fraud, with victims often being older individuals, the median age being 71. Athena Bitcoin has strongly refuted these allegations, stating that it implements robust safeguards against fraud, including clear instructions and consumer education. The company also remarked, “Just as a bank isn’t held responsible if someone willingly sends funds to someone else, Athena does not control users’ decisions.” 17 States Move To Regulate Or Ban Bitcoin ATMs In response to the rising tide of scams, AARP has called for stricter regulations on Bitcoin ATMs, suggesting measures such as daily deposit caps to protect consumers. At least 17 states have enacted legislation in recent years to regulate these Bitcoin ATM machines in the country, while some local governments have moved toward banning them entirely. New Jersey state Senator Paul Moriarty, who sponsored a bill to prohibit Bitcoin ATMs in the state, expressed strong concerns regarding their impact. “These machines are nothing more than conduits for fraud and criminal activity. Period,” he stated. “There’s no other use for them, because if you wanted to buy cryptocurrency you could buy it somewhere else for less.” In defense of their operations, companies like Bitcoin Depot have stated that while scams do occur, they represent only a small portion of overall transactions. At the time of writing, Bitcoin was trading at $88,613, marking a slight gain of 1.5% in the past 24 hours and 2% in the past seven days. However, it is still unable to surpass and consolidate above the key $90,000 mark, which is acting as the most important resistance wall in the near term.

This pivotal shift ended a concerning four-day streak of net outflows, signaling renewed institutional confidence according to the latest data from analyst Trader T. The movement, centered on funds from industry giants like Grayscale and Fidelity, provides a critical snapshot of investor sentiment as the year concluded. ETH ETF Inflows Signal Market Reversal The data reveals a clear leader in this resurgence. Grayscale’s Ethereum Trust (ETHE) spearheaded the inflow activity with a commanding $50.19 million. Consequently, this single product accounted for nearly 74% of the day’s total positive flow. Following this, Grayscale’s newer Ethereum Mini ETF contributed a solid $13.95 million. Meanwhile, Fidelity’s Wise Origin Ethereum Fund (FETH) added $3.7 million to the total. This collective action marked the first net positive day for U.S. spot ETH ETFs since December 25, breaking a pattern that had seen capital gradually exit these vehicles. To understand the scale of this shift, consider the immediate context. The prior four days saw consistent net outflows, a trend often interpreted as short-term profit-taking or portfolio rebalancing by institutional investors. The December 30 inflow, therefore, represents a notable counter-movement. Analysts frequently monitor such ETF flow data as a real-time gauge of sophisticated money positioning in the cryptocurrency space. These products serve as a primary regulated gateway for traditional finance participants to gain exposure to Ethereum’s price movements without directly holding the asset. The Mechanics and Importance of Spot ETF Flows Spot Ethereum ETFs differ fundamentally from futures-based products. A spot ETF holds the actual underlying cryptocurrency. When investors buy shares, the ETF issuer uses that cash to purchase an equivalent amount of ETH, which a custodian then holds securely. This process creates direct market demand for Ethereum. Conversely, share redemptions force the issuer to sell ETH, creating sell-side pressure. Therefore, daily net inflow and outflow figures provide a transparent window into the buying and selling pressure from a specific, influential cohort of investors. The approval and launch of these funds in late 2024 followed a lengthy regulatory journey. Their existence itself is a landmark event for the digital asset ecosystem. It grants Ethereum a level of legitimacy and accessibility previously reserved for commodities like gold or broad market indices. The flow data from Trader T and other analysts has since become a key metric. It is dissected daily by traders, journalists, and market strategists to discern trends that might not be immediately visible in raw price charts. Expert Analysis on Flow Reversals Market technicians often view a reversal after a short series of outflows as a potential sign of consolidation. It suggests that the selling pressure from one group of investors was absorbed by new buying interest, potentially establishing a new support level. While a single day’s data does not constitute a trend, it can act as a catalyst for sentiment. Furthermore, the dominance of Grayscale’s ETHE in the inflow figures is noteworthy. This fund, which converted from a closed-end trust to an ETF, carries a historically higher fee structure. Significant inflows into ETHE, despite other options, could indicate decisions based on liquidity, brand recognition, or specific institutional mandates rather than fee minimization alone. The timing at the year’s end also invites scrutiny. Portfolio managers often engage in “window dressing” or rebalancing acts in late December. They might shed underperforming assets or add positions to align with annual reporting. The inflow could reflect strategic positioning for the new fiscal year. Alternatively, it might represent a straightforward valuation play, where investors found Ethereum’s price at that moment an attractive entry point through the ETF wrapper. Without accompanying commentary from the investing institutions, the precise motivation remains interpretive, but the capital movement itself is an unambiguous factual event. Comparative Context and Broader Market Impact To fully appreciate the $67.8 million figure, a comparative perspective is essential. When spot Bitcoin ETFs launched earlier in 2024, single-day inflows regularly reached hundreds of millions, and sometimes billions, of dollars. The Ethereum ETF market, being newer and smaller, operates on a different scale. Its flows are more sensitive and can show higher volatility in percentage terms. A $67.8 million day for ETH ETFs is a strong signal within its own context, demonstrating meaningful engagement. The following table contrasts the flow data for December 30: ETF Provider Fund Name Net Inflow (Dec. 30) Grayscale Ethereum Trust (ETHE) $50.19 million Grayscale Ethereum Mini ETF $13.95 million Fidelity Wise Origin Ethereum Fund (FETH) $3.70 million Total (All U.S. Spot ETH ETFs) $67.84 million Key impacts of sustained ETF inflows include: Direct Demand Pressure: Each inflow dollar requires ETF issuers to buy ETH, supporting the asset’s price. Legitimization: Consistent investment reinforces Ethereum’s status as an institutional-grade asset. Liquidity Growth: Growing ETF assets under management deepen market liquidity for all participants. Regulatory Precedent: Successful fund growth supports the case for future digital asset financial products. Conclusion The $67.84 million net inflow into U.S. spot ETH ETFs on December 30, 2024, served as a crucial inflection point. It definitively halted a four-day outflow streak, with Grayscale’s funds leading a clear resurgence in institutional investment interest. This event underscores the dynamic nature of the cryptocurrency investment landscape, where ETF flow data has become a vital indicator of professional sentiment. While the long-term trend will require further observation, this single day’s positive movement provided a strong, data-driven counter-narrative to short-term outflows, highlighting the evolving and maturing pathways for capital to engage with digital assets like Ethereum. FAQs Q1: What does “net inflow” mean for an ETF? A1: Net inflow is the total amount of new money invested into an ETF minus the money withdrawn on a given day. A positive net inflow means more capital entered the fund than left, requiring the issuer to purchase more of the underlying asset. Q2: Why is Grayscale’s ETHE often the largest in flow data? A2: Grayscale’s Ethereum Trust (ETHE) existed as a private trust for years before converting to an ETF, giving it a first-mover advantage, massive brand recognition, and established liquidity that many institutional investors prioritize. Q3: How do spot ETF flows affect the price of Ethereum? A3: They create direct market pressure. Net inflows force ETF issuers to buy ETH on the open market, increasing demand. Sustained inflows can be a supportive factor for Ethereum’s market price. Q4: What was the significance of ending the four-day outflow streak? A4: It signaled that selling pressure through the ETF channel had subsided and was overcome by new buying interest. This can indicate a shift in short-term sentiment among institutional investors. Q5: Are Ethereum ETF flows as large as Bitcoin ETF flows? A5: Not currently. The market for spot Ethereum ETFs is newer and smaller. Bitcoin ETFs regularly see larger absolute flow numbers, but ETH ETF flows are significant within their own context and are closely watched for growth trends.

However, some analysts are pessimistic that the price could rise soon, criticizing the project for its numerous flaws. Pump on the Horizon? As of this writing, PI trades at around $0.20, meaning a mere 0.2% increase on a weekly scale. At the same time, the current level represents a staggering 93% collapse compared to the all-time high of $3 seen in February this year. What bulls may view as good news is that the number of PI tokens stored on exchanges has been shrinking lately. Data shows that over 2.7 million coins have left such centralized platforms in the past 24 hours alone. This suggests that investors have shifted toward self-custody methods, which, in turn, reduces immediate selling pressure. Conversely, when the amount of PI tokens on exchanges is rising, this is usually seen as a pre-sale signal and a bearish factor for the price. Currently, a total of 427.2 million coins are stored on centralized platforms, with more than half of that situated on Gate.io. Bitget comes in second with approximately 145.1 million.

The commentator criticized Pi Network for its restricted transfers, unclear tokenomics and circulating supply, and for being “almost ready” for years. “Without open liquidity, independent verification, and real-world use that doesn’t rely on internal marketplaces, it’s hard to justify long-term value. Adoption without trust isn’t decentralization – it’s just scale,” they added. Earlier this month, the X user shared another critical post.

Her recent post from December 30, 2025 reiterates that: “Our market structure legislation enables public-private partnerships to combat illicit finance. With our bill, we can protect Americans and foster innovation.” The effort ultimately aims to draft clear regulatory rules for cryptocurrency while encouraging innovation and safety for customers. Senator Cynthia Lummis worked with others on the guiding principles for market structure and has shared statements supporting what they come up with to combat illicit finance Senator Cynthia Lummis doubles down on market structure legislation Senator Cynthia Lummis worked with Senate Banking Chairman Tim Scott (R-SC) and Senators Thom Tillis (R-NC) and Bill Hagerty (R-TN) on the guiding principles for market structure legislation. Those principles lay emphasis on pro-innovation rules, consumer protections, as well as the recognition of tokenization as an efficiency-enhancing evolution in finance. A core element of those principles explicitly addresses illicit finance with a draft including compliance requirements for centralized intermediaries, deliberate measures to curb money laundering and encouragement of public-private partnerships to increase detection rates. Lummis has repeatedly highlighted that the legislation mainly targets people with nefarious purposes and poses no risk to innovation. Her recent post from December 30, 2025 reiterates that. She shared the post via her official X page, and wrote : “Our market structure legislation enables public-private partnerships to combat illicit finance. With our bill, we can protect Americans and foster innovation.” At the time of this publication, the bill is stuck amid bipartisan negotiations. Many had been anticipating a markup in late 2025, but that has been postponed until early 2026. Lummis’ time at the Senate ends in January 2027, and she is determined to make sure the bill passes by the time she has to leave, viewing it as critical to keeping the growth of America’s digital assets domestic rather than offshore. Lummis has revealed she will not seek reelection Cynthia Lummis is currently the chair of the Senate Banking Committee’s crypto subpanel and a reliable ally for the crypto industry. She is currently handling negotiations as part of an industry-backed push for the broader regulation of cryptocurrency. However, when her tenure ends in 2027, the popular administrator has revealed she will not be seeking reelection , triggering contemplation among those who have dubbed her the cryptocurrency industry’s fiercest advocate on Capitol Hill. Lummis cited the “difficult, exhausting” final weeks of this year’s Congress as the main reason she chose to withdraw her reelection bid, saying she’s “come to accept that I do not have six more years in me.” Crypto interests have bemoaned her retirement, but it sets up a primary for her seat in Wyoming in 2026. “Senator Lummis has been a great ally on crypto — very sorry to see her go!” said David Sacks, the White House AI and crypto czar, in a post to X. Conner Brown, the head of strategy and the Bitcoin Policy Institute, echoed similar sentiments, calling Lummis “the Senate’s first and finest bitcoiner.” “We are incredibly lucky to have had her leadership at so many critical moments for bitcoin policy over these critical years,” Brown said.

However, even with this finding, consumer inflation levels have remained above the Bank of Korea’s 2% target for the fourth consecutive month. *]:pointer-events-auto [content-visibility:auto] supports-[content-visibility:auto]:[contain-intrinsic-size:auto_100lvh] scroll-mt-[calc(var(--header-height)+min(200px,max(70px,20svh)))]"" dir=""auto"" data-turn-id=""29b3cdf2-c0db-4aaf-9aa7-6b451ad15cea"" data-testid=""conversation-turn-2"" data-scroll-anchor=""true"" data-turn=""assistant""> Consumer prices rose 2.3% in December from a year earlier, according to the Ministry of Data and Statistics, slowing slightly from November’s 2.4% pace. The figure was in line with economists’ forecasts, which had projected inflation at around 2.3% for the month. South Korea’s consumer price surges as anticipated Core inflation, which eliminates the fluctuating prices of food and energy, increased at a rate of 2%, similar to the rate recorded in November. At this moment, analysts have discovered that both overall and core inflation rates remain near the Central Bank of South Korea’s target. Following the release of this data, analysts anticipated that price pressures in the country were starting to decline. However, they noted that there is a high possibility that these figures may not be sufficient to influence the BOK to consider restarting its monetary easing cycle when its officials establish policy on January 15. In the meantime, the current strength demonstrated in the property market sparks discussion in the industry regarding surging mortgage debt levels that could lead to financial problems, prompting the central bank to exercise caution about adding more stimulus. Furthermore, sources highlighted a high likelihood that the cost of living will continue to increase. This assumption was made after officials in the country issued a warning, suggesting that high food prices could cause inflation levels to rise more than anticipated in 2026, despite basic price pressures remaining in check most of the time. As uncertainties surrounding South Korea’s financial status intensify, a reliable source released a report this month noting that prices for food and non-alcoholic beverages have increased sharply by approximately 3.6% compared to last year. The costs of Housing and utilities, on the other hand, dropped drastically by 3%, while costs related to transportation soared by 3.2%. Costs of telecommunications, alcoholic drinks, and tobacco products are reported to be the primary factor behind this decline. In response to this situation, policymakers acknowledged the weakness of the won. They vowed to closely examine the possible risks that could result from this weakness as they weigh suitable measures to address the issue. They warned that these risks could lead to price hikes for imported goods in the nation, which depends heavily on foreign food and energy supplies. Generally, consumer price rises were moderate in November, with the costs of education soaring by approximately 1.6% and recreation and culture increasing by about 1.2%, both slower than in the last month. On the other hand, apartment prices in Seoul continued to rise for the 47th consecutive week as of December 22, according to data from the Korea Real Estate Board, thereby raising concerns among central bank officials who worried that lowering interest rates could lead to financial imbalances. The BOK opts to eliminate the possibility of further rate cuts in 2026 The BOK decided to keep its key interest rate unchanged at 2.5% in late November. At this point, the central bank opted to increase its growth and inflation predictions slightly. Its team also chose to eliminate a statement regarding continuing to think about rate cuts, prompting several economists to believe that the cycle of easing rates could be wrapped up. To address this issue, officials have declared that they are exploring various possibilities. One suggested effective solution was noted after the bank announced that it would discard the possibility of further rate cuts next year as it focuses on financial stability threats from foreign exchange and housing markets. “We think CPI will stay high for a while because a weaker won raises import costs and keeps underlying pressures strong. This ongoing inflation situation supports our belief that the BOK will overlook the recent dip in factory production and maintain the policy rate at 2.5%,” said economist Hyosung Kwon.

This proactive overhaul directly responds to the explosive growth of cloud services and virtual assets, aiming to establish a robust security framework for 2026 and beyond. Consequently, the financial landscape in one of Asia’s most crypto-active markets is poised for a significant transformation. South Korea’s FSI Crypto Standards: A Response to Rapid Digital Evolution The Financial Security Institute’s decision stems from a rapidly transforming IT environment. Notably, the expansion of cloud infrastructure and the surge in digital asset adoption have created new, complex vulnerability landscapes. Therefore, the FSI is updating its Vulnerability Analysis and Evaluation Standards to address these modern challenges head-on. The institute explicitly cited the need to manage risks associated with regulatory compliance and technological innovation. This revision marks a critical step in institutionalizing cryptocurrency within the nation’s formal financial security apparatus. Previously, security evaluations followed broader IT guidelines. However, the new framework establishes dedicated assessment categories. These categories are meticulously designed for the unique architecture of virtual asset operations. For instance, the FSI will now evaluate compliance systems, blockchain node security, digital wallet safeguards, and smart contract integrity. This targeted approach ensures security protocols match the specific risks of crypto businesses. Ultimately, it reflects the market’s maturation and the government’s commitment to consumer protection. Decoding the New Virtual Asset Security Evaluation Criteria The core of the update lies in its new, granular assessment categories. Each category addresses a fundamental component of a virtual asset service provider’s (VASP) ecosystem. The FSI’s move signals a deep understanding of the sector’s technical nuances. Below is a breakdown of the primary new evaluation areas: Virtual Asset Compliance Systems: This category assesses the mechanisms exchanges use to adhere to regulations like the Travel Rule and anti-money laundering (AML) protocols. It evaluates real-time transaction monitoring and reporting capabilities. Blockchain Infrastructure Security: Evaluations will focus on the security of nodes, consensus mechanisms, and network communication. The goal is to prevent 51% attacks and ensure network integrity. Digital Wallet Safeguards: This involves scrutinizing both hot and cold wallet storage solutions. Criteria include key generation, storage, encryption standards, and withdrawal authorization processes. Smart Contract Audits & Risk: The FSI will evaluate processes for code auditing, vulnerability testing, and upgrade mechanisms for smart contracts deployed or supported by the exchange. These criteria will be applied across three operational domains: virtual asset operations, management frameworks, and utilization processes. This holistic view ensures security is not just a technical issue but an organizational imperative. As a result, exchanges must integrate security into their core business logic and daily workflows. Expert Analysis: Why This Revision is a Watershed Moment Financial technology analysts view this announcement as a watershed moment for South Korea’s crypto industry. “The FSI’s action institutionalizes security in a market known for its retail enthusiasm,” notes Dr. Min-ji Park, a fintech policy researcher at Seoul National University. “By creating explicit criteria, they are moving from reactive enforcement to proactive risk management. This mirrors global trends but with a distinct Korean rigor.” The timeline is also strategic. Announcing the 2026 standards in late 2024 provides exchanges and service providers a substantial runway—over a year—to adapt their systems, conduct internal audits, and align their operations. The revision also has clear implications for market structure. Larger, well-capitalized exchanges with dedicated security teams will likely meet the new standards more readily. Conversely, smaller platforms may face significant compliance costs. This could accelerate market consolidation, leading to a more stable, if less numerous, exchange landscape. Furthermore, it enhances South Korea’s position in global regulatory dialogues, demonstrating a sophisticated, risk-based approach to digital asset oversight. The Broader Impact on Institutional Adoption and Global Standards The FSI’s update is a direct enabler for greater institutional participation. Pension funds, asset managers, and traditional banks have cited security and regulatory clarity as primary barriers to entering the crypto space. By establishing a clear, government-backed security benchmark, the FSI reduces this uncertainty. Institutional players can now point to a defined set of national standards when conducting due diligence on Korean exchanges. This paves the way for more sophisticated financial products, like crypto-based ETFs and structured notes, to gain traction in the domestic market. Globally, South Korea’s move contributes to an emerging patchwork of security standards for digital assets. While the EU has MiCA (Markets in Crypto-Assets Regulation) and Singapore has its Payment Services Act, South Korea is now pioneering a detailed, security-focused technical framework. This positions the FSI’s standards as a potential model for other jurisdictions developing their own rules. The focus on operational, managerial, and utilization security offers a comprehensive blueprint that others may emulate or adapt. Conclusion South Korea’s FSI has taken a definitive step toward securing the future of its digital asset ecosystem with its revised 2026 security standards. By introducing explicit crypto exchange criteria for compliance, blockchain, wallets, and smart contracts, the institute is proactively addressing the risks of a rapidly evolving market. This framework not only protects consumers but also legitimizes the industry, encouraging responsible innovation and institutional investment. The success of these South Korea FSI crypto standards will likely influence regulatory approaches worldwide, marking a pivotal chapter in the integration of virtual assets into the global financial mainstream. FAQs Q1: What is the South Korean FSI and what did it announce? The Financial Security Institute (FSI) is a key South Korean financial authority. On December 31, it announced a major revision of its national Vulnerability Analysis and Evaluation Standards for 2026, introducing the first dedicated security criteria for cryptocurrency exchanges and virtual asset services. Q2: What are the main new security categories for crypto exchanges? The FSI established four new assessment categories: Virtual Asset Compliance, Blockchain Infrastructure Security, Digital Wallet Safeguards, and Smart Contract Audit & Risk. These will be used to evaluate the security of exchanges’ operations, management, and service utilization. Q3: Why is the FSI making these changes now? The revision is a direct response to the fast-changing IT landscape, specifically the massive expansion of cloud services and the rapid growth of the digital asset market. The goal is to proactively manage emerging risks like hacking and regulatory non-compliance. Q4: When will these new standards take effect? The updated standards are slated for implementation in 2026. The announcement at the end of 2024 provides virtual asset service providers over a year to prepare and align their systems with the new requirements. Q5: How will this affect cryptocurrency investors in South Korea? For investors, these standards are designed to significantly enhance the security and reliability of the exchanges they use. It should lead to stronger protections for user funds and data, reduce the risk of major exchange hacks, and foster a more stable and trustworthy trading environment.

56628076,649703,1767157226,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/56628076.jpeg,Russia Warns Crypto Miners: 5 Years In Prison For Skipping Registration,https://bitcoinist.com/russia-warns-crypto-miners-5-years-in-prison-for-skipping-registration/,"Based on reports, Russia’s Ministry of Justice has proposed criminal penalties for people who mine digital currency without registering. The draft would add a new criminal article and set fines, forced labor and prison terms tied to how big the operation is and how much money it made. The move follows a law that made mining legal under strict rules last year. Russia: New Criminal Article Proposed According to the draft amendments posted on a regulatory portal, a new Article 171.6 titled “Illegal Mining Of Digital Currency And Activities Of A Mining Infrastructure Operator” would be added to the Criminal Code. Under the proposal, an unregistered miner could face a fine of up to 1.5 million rubles, compulsory labor for up to 480 hours, or forced labor for up to two years. The draft draws a line at income thresholds: if mining generated large-scale income of 3.5 million rubles, liability applies. For operations that are part of an organized group or that produced especially large income of 13.5 million rubles, penalties rise sharply — fine ranges from 500,000 to 2.5 million rubles, forced labor of up to five years, or imprisonment for up to five years combined with additional financial penalties. Total crypto market cap currently at $2.97 trillion. Chart: TradingView Registries And Monthly Reporting Reports have disclosed that Russia legalized mining on November first, 2024, and on that date the Federal Tax Service opened special registries. All legal entities and individual entrepreneurs involved in mining must register, and operators of mining infrastructure are included. Registered miners are required to report mined digital currency every month through a section in their personal accounts on the Federal Tax Service website. Based on the agency’s figures, there were more than 1,000 participants listed in the registries by the end of May 2025. Visibility And Control Through Registration The draft law appears aimed at forcing visibility into a sector that has often operated in the shadows. By tying criminal penalties to failure to join the registry, authorities gain tools to pursue operators who avoid paying taxes, use subsidized power, or run large-scale farms without oversight. Smaller, informal miners are left most exposed because they may lack the paperwork or know-how to comply with reporting rules. Timing And Enforcement Signals Deputy Prime Minister Alexander Novak has said the government plans to introduce criminal liability for illegal mining and illegal lending in 2026. That comment, combined with the publication of the draft amendments, suggests phased steps: rules and registries are already in place, while tougher criminal measures could follow next year. Some language in the draft also allows courts to impose fines equal to a convicted person’s salary or income for set periods, which would target earnings from mining operations.

Related Reading: Solana Bearish Formation Hints At Major Correction Until Mid-2026 – Here’s The Target 2025 Crypto Losses Increase By 45% On Tuesday, blockchain security firm SlowMist shared its 2025 Blockchain Security & AML Annual Report, highlighting the severe security challenges the crypto industry faced throughout the year. According to SlowMist, the total value stolen from crypto hacks increased by 46% in 2025 compared to 2024, a trend previously noticed by earlier reports. Notably, crypto theft had been more devastating by the first half of this year than the entirety of 2024. A Mid-Year report by Chainalysis showed that 2025’s activity by the end of June revealed a significantly steeper trajectory into the end of the first half than any previous year, with an alarming velocity and consistency. Now that the year is near its end, security incidents have cost approximately $2.935 billion, according to SlowMist data, significantly surpassing the $2.013 billion in losses from the previous year. However, the number of incidents dropped year-over-year (YoY) despite the total amount of losses increasing, signaling a trend of fewer but larger-scale crypto heists. The number of incidents declined by 51%, with 200 cases in 2025. In comparison, 2024 saw 410 reported hacks. The report shared that DeFi remained the most frequently targeted sector this year, with 126 security incidents, accounting for approximately 63% of all hacks and total losses of around $649 million. This represents a 37% and 62% YoY decrease from 2024’s 339 incidents and $1.029 billion in losses, respectively. Meanwhile, Centralized exchange (CEX) platforms reported 22 incidents, which accounted for $1.809 billion in losses, led by Bybit’s hack. The February attack resulted in approximately $1.46 billion being stolen in a single incident, becoming the most serious and largest security event of the year. Regulatory Enforcement Strengthens Although phishing remained one of the most active schemes, scams and intrusive attacks continued to evolve in 2025, noted SlowMist. Therefore, scams have become more deceptive and difficult to detect, with malicious actors no longer relying on a single method of attack to deceive victims: Traditional phishing has gradually expanded into permission hijacking, malicious code execution, and supply-chain poisoning. Attacks are no longer reliant on a single method; instead, they increasingly combine social engineering, browser exploitation, new protocol mechanics, and hybrid lure strategies to form stealthy and destructive attack chains. However, the report highlighted that crypto enforcement and sanction actions worldwide displayed a “clear trend of escalation” this year, as regulatory and law enforcement agencies directly intervened “in key areas of crypto-related money laundering, fraud, sanctions evasion, and illicit financing.” Related Reading: Crypto’s Big Money Signals Change: BTC Holders Pause, ETH Whales Buy Notably, there were 18 incidents this year in which lost funds were recovered or frozen. In these cases, the total stolen funds totaled to $1.95 billion, of which nearly $387 million was successfully returned or frozen. SlowMist concluded that “the development of the Web3 industry will no longer rely solely on technical innovation. (…) Organizations that can build stronger internal security controls, more transparent fund governance models, and more comprehensive KYT/AML review capabilities will gain longer-term resilience in the next cycle.” Featured Image from Unsplash.com, Chart from TradingView.com",Cryptocurrency Market News|bybit hack|crypto hacks|crypto losses|crypto losses 2025|crypto market bull run 2025|crypto market correction|crypto theft|DeFi hacks|SlowMist|total|total crypto maket cap,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|EXCHANGE|TRADING|MACROECONOMICS|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'NewsBTC', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/newsbtc.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",newsbtc,2025-12-31 05:00:35

This comes as the country ranked among the top three nations globally for crypto adoption in 2025, despite having no comprehensive legal framework at the start of the year Speaking to Bilal bin Saqib, the Pakistan Crypto Council chief executive, CZ mentioned how top officials in Pakistan have been mindful of the high demand for digital assets from a digitally native and largely young population. He commended the country for having clear direction from its leadership and the ability to move quickly. He noted, “If we keep moving at this speed in five years, Pakistan will be the crypto leader, one of the crypto leaders in the world.” CZ tells young entrepreneurs to explore crypto and blockchain CZ pointed out that due to its young population and impressive governance, Pakistan overtakes most countries when it comes to crypto adoption. He also encouraged young Pakistanis to explore crypto projects while being mindful of the risks. He argued that there are now more blockchain opportunities than those offered by banks and AI systems. He commented, “If a young person wants to start a bank, it’s pretty limited opportunities If they want to build an AI company, they probably don’t have the large data, the large compute, all the chips, so both of those industries require quite a bit of resources to do a startup.” He further explained that since blockchain and cryptocurrency are virtual, there is no possibility of getting turned away, which makes these technologies well-suited to entrepreneurs. However, he also emphasized the importance of university programs, incubators, and educational initiatives in promoting innovation and growth. Speaking on global adoption, the Binance founder emphasized that cryptocurrency is still in its early stages of development, with many new products to come. He claimed the industry is nowhere near saturated and still has many untapped opportunities. Pakistan has already made substantive strides towards crypto regulation and development. For starters, it established the Pakistan Virtual Assets Regulatory Authority, which has so far called on major exchanges and virtual asset service providers (VASPs) to submit Expressions of Interest for their operations in-country. More recently, it granted NOCs to Binance and HTX, allowing them to register locally. The nation is also developing a Bitcoin reserve and tokenizing real-world assets to attract foreign investment and improve liquidity. In May, Pakistani authorities also allocated 2,000 megawatts of power to fuel Bitcoin mining and AI data centres as part of a broader digital strategy aimed at global leadership. At the time, Saqib had even noted that they intended to turn the nation into a worldwide powerhouse for crypto and artificial intelligence. CZ encourages Pakistan to tokenize more of its stocks Still in his interview with Saqib, CZ explained that tokenizing Pakistan’s stock market could open it up to global investors, adding that all countries want their stocks to be accessible to a global audience. He advised Pakistan to move fast on tokenization, emphasizing that the first countries to implement it will benefit the most. Earlier this month, the nation inked a memorandum of understanding with Binance to potentially tokenize $2 billion in government securities and commodity reserves. At the time of signing, Zhao stated that the deal sent a strong signal to the global blockchain sector and Pakistan, marking the beginning of full tokenization efforts.

Zhao also mentioned blockchain’s low barriers to entry for entrepreneurs and pointed out that continued investment in education and innovation will be key to turning Pakistan’s crypto momentum into long-term economic growth. Pakistan Could Lead the Crypto World Former Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao believes Pakistan could become one of the world’s leading crypto hubs by 2030 if it maintains its current pace of regulation and adoption. Speaking in an interview with Pakistan Crypto Council CEO Bilal bin Saqib, Zhao praised the country’s leadership for recognizing strong demand for digital assets among its young, tech-savvy population and for moving quickly on policy decisions. Zhao said that Pakistan’s ability to act decisively sets it apart from many larger jurisdictions, and argued that speed and clarity in regulation are critical advantages in the global crypto race. He noted that if the country sustains this momentum over the next five years, it could turn itself into one of the top crypto leaders worldwide. Pakistan has already taken several steps this year to formalize its digital asset ecosystem, including the creation of the Pakistan Virtual Assets Regulatory Authority, allowing exchanges like Binance and HTX to operate locally, establishing a Bitcoin reserve, and exploring real-world asset tokenization to attract foreign capital and improve market liquidity. On tokenization, Zhao was particularly bullish by arguing that tokenizing Pakistan’s stock market could open domestic equities to global investors. He said tokenized stocks will allow international participants to gain direct exposure to Pakistani companies, effectively channeling foreign investment into the local economy. Zhao added that countries that move first on tokenization are likely to benefit the most. Zhao also pointed out some opportunities for individuals and small businesses, and suggested that blockchain offers a lower barrier to entry compared to traditional banking or artificial intelligence. He said starting a bank or an AI company typically requires a lot of capital, infrastructure, and data, while blockchain-based projects are largely virtual and more accessible to young entrepreneurs. According to Zhao, this openness makes crypto one of the most attractive spaces for innovation, as participation is not limited by gatekeepers. At the same time, he explained that long-term success will depend on education and ecosystem support. Zhao said Pakistan will need more university programs, incubators, and training initiatives to fully unlock the potential of blockchain entrepreneurship.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|EXCHANGE|BNB|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-12-31 05:30:00

To truly reap the benefits of the market swings, most investors use a stack of specialized mobile apps. These are often designed for different needs. One can be for instant swaps, one for market data, another for DeFi wallet access and so on. The investor profile has shifted from simply buy and hold to users that now expect easy to use, secure tools that help them make the most of their assets, from portfolio tracking to advanced analysis. This article highlights the six must-have cryptocurrency applications that investors actually use, each excelling in its own distinct category. These apps were selected based on daily usability, strong mobile performance across operating systems, security, multi-chain support, speed/reliability and most importantly a clear use case for those managing or looking to gain exposure to digital assets. By using these crypto apps in combination, a crypto investor in 2026 can cover all the facets required to potentially build wealth in this space. 1. ChangeNOW – Best Crypto App for Fast, Non-Custodial Crypto Swaps Why it ranks #1 ChangeNOW is on the top of our list for quick and easy crypto swaps.

CoinStats is basically a complete view of your entire portfolio in one application. It does this by having access to 300+ exchanges and wallet services (portfolios are connected via API or public addresses), effectively aggregating your balances and transaction history automatically Best for CoinStats is best for crypto users who store their assets across different wallet addresses or between different networks. Whether you’re a long term holder or using hot wallets for shorter term trades, this platform gives you a birds eye view of your entire portfolio on any given day. 6. Google Authenticator (or Authy) – Best Crypto App for Security Last but not least, strong account security is a must have for crypto traders and investors. As crypto scams get more sophisticated by the day, the use of two factor authentication (2FA) apps like Google Authenticator or Authy becomes non-negotiable. These authenticator apps generate time based 6 digit code that you must enter when loggin into your exchange or wallet that has 2FA. This basically adds another layer of safety beyond a password. This sort of security is especially important in crypto, as breaches to your wallet or exchange can mean irreversible loss when transferred. Best for An authenticator app is best for everyone’s security. It’s essentially mandatory for account protection in 2026. It dramatically reduces risks when holding crypto and is a security practice that most exchanges and wallets require you to set up.

In a detailed outlook, Qureshi said Bitcoin could climb above $150,000 by the end of 2026, even as its dominance over the broader crypto market declines. Bitcoin to $150K or $70K First? The forecast comes at a time when Bitcoin has struggled to regain momentum. Despite multiple attempts, the asset has remained stuck below the $90,000 level and has failed to build on its all-time high of around $126,000 reached in October. According to Qureshi, this uneven performance does not rule out a strong comeback. Instead, he expects BTC’s price to rise significantly while capital gradually rotates into other large networks, which is expected to reduce Bitcoin’s share of the total crypto market. He suggested that this pattern would reflect a more mature market, where investors are increasingly willing to allocate funds beyond BTC once confidence returns. This bullish outlook stands in sharp contrast with warnings from other analysts who believe that Bitcoin’s bear market is far from over. Analysts such as Mr Wall Street and Doctor Profit describe the current environment as a bear market, where short-term rallies could act as liquidity traps before further declines. They argue that the crypto asset could still face a deeper downside, and some projections point to a possible drop toward the $64,000-$70,000 range and a delayed market bottom later in 2026. From Dev Activity to Big Tech Wallets Moving beyond Bitcoin, Qureshi said Ethereum and Solana are likely to “overdeliver” in 2026, as they benefit from strong developer activity and their positions as neutral infrastructure layers. At the same time, he warned that several newer chains, particularly those closely tied to financial services and consumer-facing fintech use cases, may fail to live up to the excitement surrounding them. While these projects have attracted attention for focusing on areas such as payments, stablecoins, and real-world assets, Qureshi expects their on-chain activity metrics, including daily active users and transaction flows, to disappoint. He said the best developers are still likely to concentrate on established, open platforms rather than networks that are more tightly associated with specific companies or business models. As a result, Ethereum and Solana could very well continue to attract talent and usage, while some newer chains struggle to convert early interest into lasting traction. Qureshi also made a broader prediction about corporate adoption, wherein he said that 2026 could be a turning point for crypto’s relationship with Big Tech. He expects that at least one major technology company, such as Google, Apple, or Meta, will either launch its own crypto wallet or acquire an existing one. According to Qureshi, such a move would essentially indicate that crypto wallets are becoming a standard part of digital financial infrastructure rather than a niche product for enthusiasts. He also added that more Fortune 100 companies are likely to begin using blockchain rails as well, particularly in the banking and fintech sectors. However, this adoption will not be evenly spread across all networks, and instead will concentrate around a smaller number of well-supported blockchain frameworks.

In 2028, Floki Inu is predicted to reach a maximum price of $0.000359. FLOKI price can reach a maximum level of $0.000583 and an average trading price of $0.000560 in 2031. Floki Inu is a meme coin driven by its community, the Floki Vikings. Inspired by Shiba Inu, Floki Inu aims to democratize power in the crypto space, pivoting the crypto market away from traditional financial entities. The Floki project ecosystem is diverse. It includes Valhalla, a blockchain combat game that rewards players with Floki tokens, and Floki Places, a store for merchandise and NFTs where purchases can be made using Floki tokens. Additionally, Floki University provides educational resources on the cryptocurrency market and blockchain technology. The launch (June 30, 2025) of the Valhalla mainnet of opBNB, coupled with DeFi partnerships like Chainlink, collectively enhances Floki Inu’s value and future potential by driving demand and expanding its use. Having attained its all-time high of $0.0003462 on June 5, 2024, can FLOKI reach $1?

Momentum loss favors consolidation, not immediate upside. A break above $0.0000425 or below $0.000038 will decide the next price direction. FLOKI on the daily timeframe On the daily timeframe for December 31, FLOKI is trading around $0.0000400, still capped beneath the declining mid-band near $0.0000413 and well below the upper Bollinger band around $0.0000455, confirming the broader bearish structure remains intact. FLOKIUSDT 1-day price chart by TradingView The sharp selloff earlier in the month pushed the price toward $0.0000370, which is now acting as a key demand floor. FLOKI’s price has since gone sideways, showing loss of downside momentum but no convincing reversal. The MACD remains slightly negative, although the histogram contraction suggests that selling pressure is fading rather than aggressively expanding. Unless FLOKI can reclaim $0.000042–$0.000043, rallies are likely corrective. A daily close below $0.000038 would reopen downside risk. FLOKI on the 4-hour timeframe On the 4-hour chart, price is compressing tightly around $0.0000400, aligning closely with the Alligator averages, which signals a neutral, non-trending phase. Recent higher lows from $0.0000390 hint at mild accumulation, supported by CMF holding above zero near 0.05, but upside follow-through remains weak as price repeatedly stalls near $0.0000410–$0.0000420. FLOKIUSDT 4-hour price chart by TradingView This structure favors range continuation rather than a breakout. Bulls need a clean push and hold above $0.0000425 to shift momentum, while a failure to defend $0.0000390 would likely drag the price back toward the daily support zone.

The market is coiling between $0.000038 and $0.000042, and a break from this range will define the next significant move. Is Floki Inu a good investment? FLOKI INU could be a big win or a big loss. It’s backed by a strong Floki community and consistent ecosystem developments, which can drive short-and long-term gains. But it’s risky, with price swings and unclear long-term value. Only invest if you’re comfortable with the risk. Will FLOKI reach $0.001? Expert analysis suggests that the $0.001 price point is achievable, provided utility grows and investor interest increases enough to drive FLOKI up ~11x its current market cap. Will Floki reach $0.01? FLOKI would need a market cap of up to $95 to $100 billion to hit $0.01, over 95x its current value. Only the top six cryptos have surpassed this level, making it a major challenge without massive growth in adoption and demand. While possible, it’s unlikely in the short term. Does FLOKI have a good long-term future? According to expert analysis, FLOKI has a promising long-term future with consistent growth potential. The coin could reach up to $0.002 within the decade.

FLOKI historic price sentiment Floki Inu price history by Coingecko From late 2021 to 2023, Floki experienced significant volatility. After reaching an all-time high of $0.0003437 in late 2021, prices fluctuated throughout 2022, ranging from $0.0001004 to $0.0005815.

Sentiment remains cautious, even with some modest gains across the major tokens. The Fear and Greed Index is still hovering at 32, firmly in “fear” territory. At the same time, the Altcoin Season Index at 20 suggests it’s still all about Bitcoin dominance rather than anyone having much appetite for risk. The total crypto market capitalisation is steady at around $2.98 trillion, while the 30-day trading volume is stuck at $88.9 billion. This situation is saying that the market is not panicking – but it’s not exactly confident enough to go chasing after higher prices either. Prenetics Ends Bitcoin Buying, Keeps 510 BTC Treasury Prenetics Global Limited has announced it’s stopping its daily Bitcoin buying and won’t put any more money into BTC anytime soon. The company says it will retain that 510 BTC as a treasury reserve but redirect its cash to scale its fast-growing consumer health brand, IM8. Management said the shift is due to IM8’s rapid growth, with ARR now over $100 million in just 11 months. It projects revenue of $180-200 million for 2026, has a cash hoard of over $70 million, and zero debt, which is a pretty impressive financial situation all things considered. It’s worth noting that this reduces one of the sources of extra money that corporations have been putting into Bitcoin. Still, it also highlights that more and more public companies are treating Bitcoin as a strategic reserve rather than trading it in the market. Bitcoin Technical Structure Signals Compression, Not Weakness On the 4-hour chart, Bitcoin price prediction stays neutral as BTC continues to coil inside a symmetrical triangle that has been forming since the rejection from the $94,000–$95,000 zone. A descending trendline caps lower highs, while higher lows are rising from a mid-December base near $83,500, placing the price in a clear decision zone. Candlestick behavior supports consolidation rather than stress. Repeated spinning tops and Doji candles point to equilibrium, and there has been no follow-through after bearish sessions. Bitcoin Price Chart – Source: Tradingview The 50-EMA and 100-EMA have flattened and converged near $88,200–$88,400, reinforcing the compression narrative. RSI is oscillating around 50–53, with a subtle bullish divergence versus the December low. Bitcoin Price Outlook: Break Above $90K Could Reset Momentum As long as Bitcoin holds above $85,100, the triangle structure remains intact. Using a measured move projection, a confirmed breakout above $90,000 opens the path toward $92,200, followed by a retest of $94,600. A clean resolution above that zone would shift focus toward $98,000–$100,000 into early 2026. PEPENODE: A Mine-to-Earn Meme Coin Nearing Presale Close PEPENODE is gaining momentum as a next-generation meme coin that blends viral culture with interactive gameplay. With over $2.47 mn raised and the presale approaching its cap, interest is building fast as the countdown enters its final stretch. What makes PEPENODE stand out is its mine-to-earn virtual ecosystem. Instead of passive holding, users can build digital server rooms using Miner Nodes and facilities, earning simulated rewards through a visual dashboard. The concept brings gamification and competition into the meme coin space, giving holders something to do before launch. The project also offers presale staking, allowing early participants to earn boosted rewards ahead of the token generation event. Leaderboards and bonus incentives are planned post-launch to keep engagement high. With 1 $PEPENODE priced at $0.0012161 and limited allocation remaining, the presale is entering its final opportunity window for early buyers.

This forecast comes not from speculative futurism but from two decades of pattern recognition in venture capital investing. Callaghan’s firm, which manages approximately $6 billion across multiple funds, has consistently identified paradigm shifts before they become mainstream trends. Their track record includes early investments in Fitbit, Ring, and Peloton—companies that redefined how humans interact with technology. Now, True Ventures places its next major bet on what comes after the smartphone era. The Smartphone Future: Why Current Interfaces Must Evolve Callaghan presents a compelling argument about smartphone limitations. He describes current mobile devices as “lousy interfaces” between humans and intelligence. The process of removing phones from pockets, unlocking screens, and typing messages represents significant friction in human-computer interaction. Furthermore, smartphones frequently disrupt natural social interactions and daily workflows. Market data supports this perspective: global smartphone growth has slowed to approximately 2% annually, indicating market saturation. Meanwhile, wearable technology segments demonstrate double-digit growth rates. This divergence suggests consumers increasingly seek more integrated, less intrusive technological interfaces. True Ventures’ Pattern Recognition Methodology The firm’s investment philosophy centers on identifying fundamental behavioral shifts rather than chasing technological trends. True Ventures maintains disciplined capital allocation, typically investing $3-6 million for 15-20% ownership in seed-stage companies. This approach contrasts sharply with the current AI investment landscape, where startups frequently raise hundreds of millions at billion-dollar valuations. Callaghan emphasizes that True Ventures prioritizes working with founders who share their long-term vision. The firm’s portfolio includes 63 successful exits and seven IPOs from approximately 300 companies over twenty years. Remarkably, three of their four recent 2025 exits involved repeat founders returning to collaborate with True Ventures again. The Behavioral Investment Thesis True Ventures’ most successful investments share a common characteristic: they enable new human behaviors rather than simply introducing new gadgets. The firm invested in Fitbit when wearable fitness trackers seemed niche. They backed Peloton after hundreds of other venture capitalists declined the opportunity. They supported Ring when even “Shark Tank” judges rejected the concept. Each investment appeared questionable initially but ultimately succeeded by creating new behavioral patterns. Callaghan summarizes this philosophy with his Peloton insight: “It’s not about the bike.” The hardware merely enables the behavior and community that consumers truly value. Sandbar: The Latest Manifestation of Interface Evolution The most recent embodiment of True Ventures’ interface thesis is Sandbar, a hardware device described as a “thought companion.” This voice-activated ring, worn on the index finger, serves a singular purpose: capturing and organizing thoughts through voice notes. Unlike multipurpose devices like the Humane AI Pin or health-focused wearables like Oura, Sandbar specializes in one fundamental human need. The device connects to an application that leverages artificial intelligence to process captured thoughts. Founders Mina Fahmi and Kirak Hong previously collaborated on neural interfaces at CTRL-Labs, which Meta acquired in 2019. Their expertise in brain-computer interfaces informed Sandbar’s development philosophy. True Ventures’ Interface Evolution Investments Company Investment Era Interface Innovation Behavioral Shift Fitbit Early Wearables Activity Tracking Quantified Self-Movement Peloton Connected Fitness Interactive Exercise Community-Driven Workouts Ring Smart Home Video Doorbell Remote Property Monitoring Sandbar Post-Smartphone Thought Capture Seamless Idea Documentation The AI Landscape and Interface Opportunities Callaghan acknowledges artificial intelligence represents the most significant computing wave in decades. He believes OpenAI could achieve trillion-dollar valuation status. However, he expresses concern about the capital intensity of current AI infrastructure development. Hyperscalers project $5 trillion in capital expenditure for data centers and chips. Callaghan identifies warning signs in circular financing arrangements supporting this infrastructure buildout. Despite these concerns, he remains optimistic about value creation opportunities at the application layer. New interfaces will leverage AI capabilities to enable previously impossible behaviors. The greatest innovations will emerge where artificial intelligence meets intuitive human-computer interaction. Market Validation Through Wearable Adoption Multiple market indicators validate the shift toward alternative interfaces. Consider these developments: Smartwatch penetration has increased from 14% to 35% among US adults since 2019 Smart ring shipments grew 42% year-over-year in 2024 Voice assistant usage now exceeds 50% among smartphone owners for specific tasks Enterprise adoption of wearable technology increased 28% in manufacturing and logistics sectors Investment Implications and Industry Transformation The transition from smartphones to alternative interfaces carries significant implications for technology investors and entrepreneurs. Callaghan emphasizes that successful early-stage investing should feel “scary and lonely.” Founders pursuing genuine innovation often face skepticism before achieving validation. True Ventures maintains its focus on seed-stage investments despite market pressures to pursue larger, later-stage opportunities. The firm’s measured approach extends to fund size—Callaghan questions why venture firms need billions when meaningful innovation requires thoughtful capital rather than excessive funding. This philosophy positions True Ventures to identify interface innovations that larger, momentum-driven investors might overlook. Conclusion The smartphone future appears increasingly uncertain as alternative interfaces gain traction. Jon Callaghan’s prediction of smartphone obsolescence within a decade stems from two decades of pattern recognition in human-computer interaction evolution. True Ventures’ investment thesis centers on enabling new behaviors through intuitive interfaces rather than incremental improvements to existing devices. Market data supports this perspective, showing slowing smartphone growth alongside accelerating wearable adoption. As artificial intelligence capabilities advance, the interface layer represents the next frontier for technological innovation. The transition from smartphones to more natural interaction methods will redefine how humans communicate, work, and think. This evolution promises to make technology more integrated into daily life while becoming less intrusive—a paradox that ventures like Sandbar aim to resolve through specialized, behavior-focused design. FAQs Q1: What evidence supports the claim that smartphones will become obsolete? Market data shows smartphone growth has slowed to approximately 2% annually while wearable technology segments experience double-digit growth. Additionally, consumer behavior indicates increasing preference for less intrusive interfaces that integrate more seamlessly into daily activities. Q2: How does True Ventures identify promising interface innovations? The firm focuses on technologies that enable new human behaviors rather than simply introducing new gadgets. They seek founders with compelling visions for how humans might interact with technology more naturally, often investing before market trends become apparent. Q3: What distinguishes Sandbar from other wearable devices? Sandbar specializes exclusively in thought capture through voice notes, unlike multipurpose devices. Its design philosophy prioritizes doing one thing exceptionally well—addressing what Callaghan describes as a “fundamental human behavioral need missing from technology today.” Q4: How does artificial intelligence factor into interface evolution? AI enables more natural, context-aware interactions between humans and technology. As AI capabilities advance, interfaces can become more intuitive, predictive, and personalized, reducing the cognitive load currently associated with smartphone interactions. Q5: What timeline does Callaghan propose for smartphone transition? He suggests smartphones will see significantly different usage patterns within five years and could become largely obsolete within a decade. This transition will likely occur gradually as alternative interfaces prove more effective for specific use cases.

Bitcoin Coinbase Premium Gap Has Plunged In a new post on X, CryptoQuant community analyst Maartunn has talked about the latest trend in the Bitcoin Coinbase Premium Gap. This indicator keeps track of the difference between the BTCUSD price on Coinbase and BTCUSDT price on Binance. Related Reading: Bitcoin Retail Optimism Returns To End 2025—What Usually Follows? Coinbase is mainly used by traders in the US, especially the large institutional entities, while Binance hosts a global traffic. As such, the Coinbase Premium Gap reflects the difference in behavior between American and offshore whales. When the value of the metric is greater than zero, it means the asset is trading at a higher value on Coinbase than Binance. Such a trend implies users of the former are applying a higher amount of buying pressure (or lower amount of selling pressure) as compared to the userbase of the latter. On the other hand, the indicator being negative suggests Binance may be observing a higher amount of accumulation as the cryptocurrency is going for a higher price on the platform. Now, here is the chart shared by Maartunn that shows the trend in the Bitcoin Coinbase Premium Gap over the last year and a half: As displayed in the above graph, the Bitcoin Coinbase Premium Gap has fallen into the negative territory recently, implying the American investors have shifted their behavior to one of higher selling pressure/lower buying pressure. In other words, demand from US traders has gone down. Currently, the indicator is sitting at a value of -$122, which means the cryptocurrency’s price is trading at a discount of $122 on Coinbase relative to Binance. The last time that the metric fell to such a low level was during the price crash in November. In recent times, US institutional entities have played an impactful role in the market, so the Coinbase Premium Gap, which acts a proxy of their behavior, has tended to have some correlation with the asset’s spot price. This pattern was once again seen in November, when a drawdown occurred in the cryptocurrency alongside a plunge into the red zone for the metric. So far, Bitcoin has managed to be relatively stable even with the low demand from the American whales, but it only remains to be seen how long that will continue, given the scale of the discount on Coinbase. Related Reading: Bitcoin Equilibrium: Active Market Participants Just Breaking Even The current value of the Coinbase Premium Gap is one of the lowest in the last 18 months, being seen on only five occasions in this window.

South Korea’s Digital Assets Act Delayed On Tuesday, local news outlets reported that South Korea’s Second Phase of the Virtual Asset User Protection Act will be delayed until next year as financial authorities continue to clash over stablecoin issuance-related legislation. According to Yonhap News Agency, financial circles and the National Assembly shared on December 30 that the main policies of the crypto framework have been largely decided. Notably, the Financial Services Commission (FSC)’s draft is expected to include investor protection measures such as no-fault liability for crypto asset operators and isolation of bankruptcy risks for stablecoin issuers. As part of investor protection measures, stablecoin issuers will likely be required to manage reserve assets in deposits and government bonds. In addition, they will be required to deposit or entrust at least 100% of the issuance amount with custodians such as banks. The bill could also require crypto asset operators to comply with disclosure obligations as well as terms and conditions. Moreover, it may “impose strict liability for damages on digital asset operators in accordance with the Electronic Financial Transactions Act in cases of hacking or computer system failures.” It will seemingly address allowing the sale of domestic crypto assets, subject to sufficient disclosure of information. Despite this, the key issues remain unresolved, suggesting that the final submission deadline will likely be pushed to the start of 2026. Stablecoin Issuance Dispute Continues As reported by Bitcoinist, the Financial Services Commission failed to submit the highly anticipated Digital Assets Act, which is expected to address the issuance and distribution of Korean won (KRW)-pegged stablecoins. The financial regulator did not meet the December 10 deadline set by the South Korean ruling party to submit the government’s legislation to the National Policy Committee. The bill was delayed after the FSC and the Bank of Korea (BOK) were unable to resolve their differences over the issuance of won-denominated stablecoins nearly three weeks ago. The financial authorities have been debating this issue for months, with reports in November suggesting that the long-awaited legislation, which was expected to be approved at the end of this year, risked being delayed. The FSC and the BOK disagree on the extent of banks’ role despite agreeing that financial institutions must be involved in the issuance of won-pegged tokens. The central bank has pushed for a consortium of banks owning at least 51% of any stablecoin issuer seeking approval in the country. Meanwhile, the FSC has shared concerns that giving a majority stake to banks could reduce participation from tech firms and limit the market’s innovation. Yonhap News Agency highlighted that the financial authorities also face other disagreements, including the initial capital requirements for stablecoin issuers, with opinions ranging from 500 million to 25 billion won, and whether to separate the stablecoin issuance and distribution functions of exchanges. An FSC official reportedly asserted that they are “currently in the process of gradually narrowing the differences in positions with the relevant agencies,” while “discussing all possibilities with an open mind.” The report also noted that the ruling party’s Digital Asset Task Force (TF) is allegedly preparing its own version of the bill, based on the legislative proposals submitted by lawmakers. Notably, recent reports affirmed that the government’s proposal should be announced by early next month at the latest, as the integrated bill must be submitted in January 2026.",Crypto News|Bank of Korea|bitcoin|btc|BTCUSDT|crypto framework|Crypto legislation|Financial Services Commission (FSC)|South Korea authorities|stablecoin bill|Stablecoin Issuers,EN,0,0,ASIA|FIAT|REGULATION|MACROECONOMICS|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-12-31 06:00:46

The cryptocurrency exchange’s Chief Policy Officer, Faryar Shirzad, asserts that the United States risks falling behind China if policymakers prohibit or limit interest payments on stablecoins. This warning comes as China advances its digital yuan program with interest-bearing capabilities, potentially reshaping global financial competition. The stablecoin interest policy debate now represents a critical inflection point for American financial innovation. Stablecoin Interest Policy: The New Frontier in Global Financial Competition The global competition for digital finance supremacy has entered a decisive phase. China’s central bank recently issued guidelines permitting interest payments on digital yuan wallets. Consequently, this development signals a strategic shift in central bank digital currency (CBDC) implementation. Meanwhile, the United States continues debating stablecoin regulation through proposed legislation like the CLARITY Act. The divergence between these approaches could determine which nation leads the next generation of financial systems. Faryar Shirzad emphasizes the urgency of this moment. “China’s decision marks the beginning of a global digital money race,” he stated. “The U.S. can no longer delay decisions on allowing interest payments.” His comments highlight how technological innovation intersects with regulatory frameworks. Furthermore, they underscore the competitive pressures reshaping international finance. The Digital Yuan’s Strategic Advancements China’s digital currency electronic payment (DCEP) system represents a comprehensive CBDC implementation. The People’s Bank of China (PBOC) has systematically developed this infrastructure since 2014. Recent guidelines now permit interest payments on digital yuan holdings. This feature creates several strategic advantages: Enhanced Adoption Incentives: Interest payments encourage broader digital yuan usage Monetary Policy Tool: Direct interest rate application to digital currency Financial Inclusion: Banking services accessible without traditional accounts Cross-Border Efficiency: Streamlined international transactions with programmable features The digital yuan’s interest-bearing capability represents a significant innovation. It transforms CBDCs from simple digital cash to sophisticated financial instruments. This evolution challenges existing dollar dominance in international trade and finance. Comparative Analysis: US and China Approaches The following table illustrates key differences between American and Chinese approaches to digital currency interest policies: Aspect United States Approach China Approach Primary Focus Private sector stablecoin regulation Central bank digital currency development Interest Policy Status Under debate in Congress Implemented for digital yuan Regulatory Framework Multiple agencies with overlapping jurisdiction Centralized under People’s Bank of China Implementation Timeline Legislation pending since 2022 Pilot programs since 2020, expanding nationally International Strategy Maintaining existing dollar dominance Creating alternative international settlement system The CLARITY Act and American Regulatory Challenges The Crypto-Asset Reporting, Innovation, and Technology Act (CLARITY Act) represents America’s primary legislative response. This comprehensive bill addresses multiple aspects of cryptocurrency regulation. However, it remains silent on specific interest payment provisions for stablecoins. This omission creates uncertainty for financial innovators and investors alike. Congressional negotiations continue shaping the final legislation. Multiple committees claim jurisdiction over different aspects of digital asset regulation. Consequently, this fragmented approach slows decision-making. Meanwhile, other nations advance their digital currency strategies with greater coordination. Financial technology experts express concern about this regulatory lag. Dr. Sarah Johnson, a Georgetown University fintech researcher, explains the implications. “Interest-bearing digital currencies create new monetary policy transmission channels,” she notes. “Delaying decisions on this front cedes strategic ground to competitors.” Her analysis highlights the technical sophistication underlying seemingly simple interest payment features. Global Implications of Digital Currency Competition The stablecoin interest policy debate extends beyond national borders. International financial systems face potential restructuring based on digital currency adoption patterns. Several key implications emerge from this competition: Reserve Currency Status: Digital dollar alternatives could challenge traditional dominance Payment System Architecture: New infrastructures bypassing SWIFT networks Financial Surveillance: Differing approaches to privacy and transaction monitoring Developing Nation Adoption: Countries may align with whichever system offers better terms These implications demonstrate why Coinbase’s warning carries significant weight. The stablecoin interest policy decision affects America’s position in global finance. It also influences technological innovation within financial services more broadly. Historical Context and Future Projections Digital currency development follows decades of financial innovation. The 2008 financial crisis accelerated interest in alternative systems. Bitcoin’s creation that same year demonstrated decentralized possibilities. Subsequently, stablecoins emerged as bridge assets between traditional and digital finance. Central banks initially viewed cryptocurrencies with skepticism. However, China’s 2014 digital currency research initiative changed this dynamic. Other nations recognized the strategic importance of CBDCs. Currently, over 130 countries explore digital currency options according to International Monetary Fund data. Future projections suggest several possible outcomes. The United States might maintain leadership through regulatory clarity and innovation. Alternatively, fragmented regulation could push development offshore. China’s centralized approach offers different advantages and challenges. The coming years will determine which model proves more effective internationally. Industry Perspectives and Economic Impacts Financial institutions closely monitor stablecoin interest policy developments. Banking organizations recognize both threats and opportunities. Traditional banks face potential disintermediation from interest-bearing digital currencies. However, they also see partnership possibilities with regulated stablecoin issuers. Investment firms analyze the macroeconomic implications. Interest-bearing digital currencies could alter savings behavior and capital allocation. They might also influence monetary policy effectiveness in different economic conditions. These complex interactions require careful study and regulatory consideration. Consumer advocacy groups emphasize different concerns. They focus on protection mechanisms for digital currency holders. Interest payments raise questions about insurance coverage and risk disclosure. These consumer protection aspects must accompany any interest-bearing digital currency framework. Conclusion The stablecoin interest policy debate represents a critical moment for American financial leadership. Coinbase’s warning highlights the competitive pressures from China’s digital yuan advancements. The United States faces a clear choice between embracing financial innovation or risking diminished global influence. Congressional action on the CLARITY Act will signal America’s direction in the digital finance race. Ultimately, decisions made in coming months could determine financial system architecture for decades. The stablecoin interest policy question therefore demands urgent and thoughtful resolution. FAQs Q1: What exactly are interest payments on stablecoins? Interest payments on stablecoins refer to yield or returns paid to holders of these digital assets, similar to interest earned in savings accounts. These payments typically come from reserves or lending activities backing the stablecoins. Q2: Why does China allowing interest on the digital yuan concern US policymakers? China’s interest-bearing digital yuan creates competitive advantages in digital finance adoption, potentially challenging dollar dominance in international trade and giving China first-mover advantages in CBDC technology and standards. Q3: What is the CLARITY Act mentioned in the article? The Crypto-Asset Reporting, Innovation, and Technology Act (CLARITY Act) is proposed US legislation that would establish comprehensive regulatory frameworks for digital assets, including stablecoins, but currently lacks specific provisions addressing interest payments. Q4: How might interest-bearing stablecoins affect traditional banking? Interest-bearing stablecoins could compete with traditional savings accounts, potentially drawing deposits away from banks and creating disintermediation risks unless banks integrate these technologies into their offerings. Q5: What are the main arguments against allowing interest on stablecoins? Opponents cite concerns about financial stability risks, potential bank runs, regulatory complexity, consumer protection challenges, and possible circumvention of existing banking regulations designed to maintain system stability.

This comes as precious metals were the standout performers among commodities this year, with silver outperforming most major equity indexes and currencies. At the same time, gold reached record highs due to economic and geopolitical risks. Tesla CEO Elon Musk criticized the move on his social media platform X, responding to a post about the upcoming restrictions. “This is not good. Silver is needed in many industrial processes,” he wrote. However, the rules are not new. China’s Commerce Ministry first announced the measures in October to strengthen oversight of rare metals, coinciding with a meeting between U.S. President Donald Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping in South Korea. At that time, Beijing agreed to a one-year pause on certain rare earth export controls, while the U.S. rolled back tariffs. At the beginning of December, China published a list of 44 companies approved to export silver under the new measures in 2026 and 2027. The 2026 regulations also tightened the export of tungsten and antimony, materials that are dominated by China’s supply chain and are widely used in defense and advanced technologies. Even though China hasn’t officially imposed a blanket ban on silver exports, the state-run Securities Times said on Tuesday that an unnamed industry insider stated the new policy formally elevates the metal from an ordinary commodity to a strategic material, placing its export controls on the same regulatory footing as those for rare earths. Precious metals surge as investors flee the weakening U.S. dollar A November flash survey by the EU Chamber of Commerce in China found that most members have already been, or expect to be, affected by these export restrictions. In November, the U.S. added silver to its nationally designated list of critical minerals , highlighting its importance in electrical circuits, batteries, solar cells, and anti-bacterial medical instruments. Another U.S. analysis stated that China was one of the world’s largest producers of silver in 2024 and also home to one of the largest silver reserves. China exported more than 4,600 tons of silver in the first 11 months of the year, significantly exceeding the roughly 220 tons of imports during that period, according to Wind Information, which cited official figures. The restrictions on silver come just as interest in the metal has increased in recent weeks. Two Chinese firms reached out to Canada-based Kuya Silver on Friday, offering to buy physical silver at about $8 more than the market price at the time, CEO David Stein confirmed. According to him, one company was a manufacturer while the other was a large trading firm. Stein added that an Indian buyer approached Kuya on Monday with an offer $10 above the market price. Separately, a column in The Free Press on Tuesday by George Mason University economics professor Tyler Cowen suggested that the surge in silver and gold prices reflects investors moving away from the U.S. dollar. He called the surge in prices “a flashing warning for the [U.S.] economy.” The U.S. dollar index has plunged by almost 9.5% in 2025, its worst performance in 8 years. Global buyers offer premiums amid growing silver demand In comparison, silver has more than doubled in price this year, on track for its strongest annual gain since 1979, when it soared nearly 470%. Prices pulled back on Wednesday after hitting a record above $80 an ounce earlier in the week, with spot silver last trading around $73. Gold has risen over 60% so far in 2025, also positioning itself for its best year since 1979. Bitcoin, often promoted as a gold alternative, traded near $88,000 Wednesday morning Beijing time, down more than 5% for the year.

This decisive action represents the latest escalation in South Korea’s aggressive regulatory campaign targeting virtual asset service providers, signaling a new era of enforcement rigor that could reshape the entire Asian cryptocurrency landscape. Korbit’s Compliance Breakdown: A Detailed Analysis The Financial Intelligence Unit, operating under South Korea’s Financial Services Commission, identified approximately 22,000 separate violations across multiple compliance categories. These failures represent a comprehensive breakdown of Korbit’s regulatory obligations. Specifically, the FIU documented violations in customer due diligence procedures and transaction restriction protocols. Furthermore, investigators discovered 19 separate transactions with unregistered overseas virtual asset service providers. Additionally, Korbit failed to conduct mandatory money laundering risk assessments before listing new digital assets. The regulatory examination revealed systemic weaknesses in Korbit’s compliance framework. For instance, the exchange neglected proper customer identification procedures in thousands of cases. Moreover, transaction monitoring systems failed to flag suspicious activities appropriately. Consequently, these deficiencies created substantial vulnerabilities within South Korea’s financial ecosystem. The Financial Services Commission emphasized that such lapses undermine the integrity of the entire virtual asset market. South Korea’s Evolving Crypto Regulatory Landscape South Korea has progressively tightened cryptocurrency regulations since implementing the Special Financial Transactions Information Act in March 2021. This legislation established comprehensive requirements for virtual asset service providers. Specifically, it mandated strict anti-money laundering protocols and customer verification procedures. Additionally, the Act required exchanges to maintain real-name verification partnerships with domestic banks. Furthermore, it imposed reporting obligations for suspicious transactions exceeding specific thresholds. The Korbit enforcement action follows several high-profile regulatory interventions. For example, the Financial Services Commission previously suspended operations at several smaller exchanges in 2021. Similarly, regulators imposed significant penalties on other platforms for compliance shortcomings. These consistent enforcement patterns demonstrate South Korea’s commitment to financial system integrity. Moreover, they reflect growing international coordination on cryptocurrency regulation standards. Recent South Korean Crypto Enforcement Actions Exchange Year Violation Penalty Korbit 2024 AML/CDD failures 2.73B won fine Multiple exchanges 2021 Registration issues Business suspension Bithumb 2020 Data protection Financial penalty Expert Analysis: The Compliance Imperative Financial regulation experts emphasize the broader implications of this enforcement action. According to industry analysts, the Korbit penalty establishes several important precedents. First, it demonstrates regulators’ willingness to impose substantial financial penalties for compliance failures. Second, it highlights the importance of executive accountability in cryptocurrency operations. Third, it signals increased scrutiny of relationships with overseas service providers. Compliance professionals note that cryptocurrency exchanges must prioritize several key areas: Enhanced Due Diligence: Implement robust customer identification and verification systems Transaction Monitoring: Develop sophisticated systems to detect suspicious activities Risk Assessment: Conduct thorough evaluations before listing new assets International Compliance: Verify registration status of overseas partners Executive Oversight: Ensure leadership accountability for compliance programs Executive Accountability and Industry Impact The Financial Intelligence Unit extended disciplinary actions beyond institutional penalties. Specifically, regulators issued a formal caution to Korbit’s Chief Executive Officer. Additionally, they delivered an official reprimand to the Chief Compliance Officer. These personal sanctions represent a significant development in regulatory enforcement philosophy. Consequently, they establish clear expectations for executive responsibility in cryptocurrency enterprises. Industry observers anticipate several immediate impacts from this enforcement action. First, other cryptocurrency exchanges will likely review and strengthen their compliance programs. Second, investors may become more selective about platform security and regulatory adherence. Third, international regulators might reference this case in their own enforcement approaches. Finally, compliance technology providers could experience increased demand for advanced monitoring solutions. Global Regulatory Context and Future Implications South Korea’s enforcement action occurs within a broader global regulatory trend. International organizations like the Financial Action Task Force have advocated for consistent cryptocurrency regulations worldwide. Many jurisdictions have responded with enhanced regulatory frameworks. For instance, the European Union implemented comprehensive Markets in Crypto-Assets regulations. Similarly, Singapore strengthened its Payment Services Act governing digital asset providers. The Korbit case demonstrates several emerging regulatory priorities. First, authorities increasingly focus on cross-border transaction monitoring. Second, regulators emphasize proactive risk assessment rather than reactive compliance. Third, enforcement agencies target both institutional and individual accountability. These trends suggest cryptocurrency exchanges must adopt more sophisticated compliance strategies. Moreover, they indicate regulators will continue aggressive enforcement campaigns. Conclusion South Korea’s Financial Intelligence Unit has delivered a decisive enforcement message through its $2 million fine against Korbit for compliance failures. This action underscores the critical importance of robust anti-money laundering systems in cryptocurrency exchanges. Furthermore, it establishes clear expectations for executive accountability in virtual asset enterprises. The regulatory landscape continues evolving rapidly, with South Korea positioning itself as a global leader in cryptocurrency oversight. Consequently, exchanges must prioritize comprehensive compliance programs to maintain operational legitimacy and protect financial system integrity. The Korbit penalty serves as a stark reminder that regulatory adherence represents not merely a legal obligation but a fundamental component of sustainable cryptocurrency operations. FAQs Q1: What specific violations did Korbit commit according to South Korea’s FIU? The Financial Intelligence Unit identified approximately 22,000 violations including failures in customer due diligence procedures, transaction restriction protocols, 19 transactions with unregistered overseas virtual asset service providers, and inadequate money laundering risk assessments before listing new assets. Q2: How does this enforcement action fit into South Korea’s broader cryptocurrency regulatory approach? This penalty represents the latest escalation in South Korea’s aggressive regulatory campaign following the 2021 Special Financial Transactions Information Act implementation, demonstrating consistent enforcement patterns and commitment to financial system integrity. Q3: What personal consequences did Korbit executives face from this enforcement action? Regulators issued a formal caution to Korbit’s Chief Executive Officer and delivered an official reprimand to the Chief Compliance Officer, establishing clear expectations for executive responsibility in cryptocurrency enterprises. Q4: How might this enforcement action affect other cryptocurrency exchanges operating in South Korea? Industry analysts anticipate other exchanges will review and strengthen compliance programs, while investors may become more selective about platform security, and compliance technology providers could experience increased demand. Q5: What global regulatory trends does the Korbit enforcement action reflect? This case aligns with international regulatory priorities including cross-border transaction monitoring, proactive risk assessment, individual accountability, and follows similar regulatory strengthening in the European Union and Singapore.

This renewed focus follows a combination of factors, including rising ETF interest and greater regulatory clarity, which some commentators believe could support stronger demand over time. Market commentator Moonshilla is among those expressing this view, suggesting that XRP may be positioning itself for a substantial upward repricing under these conditions. Along similar lines, YoungHoon Kim has argued that the same structural shifts could allow XRP to approach $100 within the next 5 years. Although these perspectives have attracted attention, they have also raise d questions about feasibility, particularly in light of XRP’s large supply and the scale of valuation required to support such a price level. Is XRP to $100 Feasible? To address this question, ChatGPT examined whether $100 per XRP is realistic given the token’s supply. XRP has a maximum supply of 100 billion tokens, with approximately 60.57 billion currently in circulation. At $100, XRP would require a market capitalization of $10 trillion at full supply, and roughly $6.05 trillion at the current circulating supply. Both figures would exceed Bitcoin’s current valuation of about $1.77 trillion and surpass the market value of major global corporations such as Nvidia, Apple, Alphabet, Microsoft, and Amazon. While some community members argue that XRP’s utility in payments and settlements could justify higher valuations, ChatGPT took a more restrained view. The model noted that even huge transaction volumes do not automatically translate into sustained price repricing. Instead, it emphasized that multiple conditions would need to occur simultaneously. These include broad use of XRP by global financial institutions as a primary settlement layer, meaningful reductions in available supply, and significant expansion of the total digital asset market. As a result, the model concluded that while a $100 XRP price is mathematically possible, it remains improbable under current structural conditions, primarily due to the size of the supply and the huge valuation such a price would require. That’s Why You Need This 100x Coin As highlighted, the conditions for XRP to reach $100 make it unrealistic in the near term, if not in the future. Hence, for an average market user looking to become a millionaire this cycle, XRP may not be your best bet. On this basis, crypto users are turning to new altcoins tipped to rally extensively even in the current market uncertainty. Among the top coins that whales are buying, Minotaurus (MTAUR) has been one of the most promising. Why Just 10,000 MTAUR Can Be Life Changing At the current market price of over 0.000126 USDT , one can acquire 10,000 MTAUR for less than 10 USDT. Let’s assume that MTAUR hypothetically rallies 65,000% as XRP did from its all-time low; a 10 USDT purchase would turn into 6,510 USDT. Now, imagine buying 100 USDT, 1,000 USDT, or 10,000 USDT worth of MTAUR at the current price, and it allegedly mirrors XRP’s all-time rally. Such portfolio upsides would easily make one a millionaire. Buy MTAUR now or l earn more at minotaurus.io . Disclaimer: This is a sponsored press release for informational purposes only.

Bitcoin & Ethereum ETF Netflows Have Been Negative Recently As explained by CryptoQuant community analyst Maartunn in a new post on X, Bitcoin and Ethereum spot exchange-traded funds (ETFs) have faced a negative netflow over the past month. Spot ETFs are investment vehicles that allow investors to gain indirect exposure to an underlying asset’s price movements. In the context of cryptocurrencies, this means that an ETF investor never has to interact on-chain; the fund buys and custodies the tokens on their behalf. US spot ETFs are a relatively new phenomenon in the digital asset sector, only getting approval by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) in January 2024 for Bitcoin and July 2024 for Ethereum. Spot ETFs can look like a convenient mode of investing for traders unfamiliar with cryptocurrency wallets and exchanges. Institutional entities, in particular, prefer to gain exposure through them. Since their arrival, these investment vehicles have quickly gained popularity by tapping into this demand from the traditional investors and established themselves as one of the cornerstones of the sector. Below is a chart that shows how the 30-day netflows related to the Bitcoin and Ethereum spot ETFs have changed during their existence so far. As is visible in the graph, the 30-day spot ETF netflow has been negative for both Bitcoin and Ethereum since a while now, suggesting that the funds have been witnessing sustained net outflows. The situation has improved a bit most recently, but the indicator is still red for both assets, sitting at -$656 million for BTC and -$422 million for ETH. The weak demand in the market is similar to the phase of outflows from the first half of 2025. Back then, demand eventually made an explosive return, with Bitcoin and Ethereum witnessing sharp price rallies. It now remains to be seen whether a comeback will happen this time or if the slowdown in demand is here to stay for now. Another relatively recent source of demand in the market is digital asset treasuries . As highlighted by institutional DeFi solutions provider Sentora in a new X post , holdings of cryptocurrency treasuries now exceed $185 billion across 368 entities. Out of this amount, 73% of the digital asset treasuries are controlled by companies, while the rest is in the hands of governments. BTC Price At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading around $88,100, unchanged from last week.",Bitcoin News|bitcoin|bitcoin ETFs|btc|BTCUSDT|ETH|Ethereum|Ethereum ETFs,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|ETH|TRADING|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-12-31 07:00:36

As we pivot toward 2026, the industry is asking: How will HTX Futures sustain this momentum? And what is the driving force behind the “Copy Trading 4.0” buzz? In the latest episode of Real Talk with HTX Executives, YOYO, Head of HTX Futures, addressed users directly to unpack the brand’s 2025 milestones and unveil the strategic blueprint for 2026. Copy Trading 4.0: A System-Level Product Rebuild Launched in 2023 and iterated throughout 2024, Copy Trading 4.0 saw breakout growth in late 2025. It is now recognized as the benchmark for HTX’s “human-centric” transformation. YOYO summarized this leap forward with three pillars: Enhanced User-Friendliness, Absolute Transparency, and Superior Security. The copy trading engine is now natively integrated into the core futures interface. This “develop once, deploy everywhere” architecture ensures that every new futures feature is instantly available to copy traders, drastically shortening the innovation cycle. For beginners, Smart Copy Mode removes the friction of complex configurations, allowing users to follow elite traders with balanced risk exposure. The system also offers a seamless “dual-identity” switch, letting users toggle between being a follower and a lead trader. To prevent position commingling, the system now utilizes independent capital pools for each followed trader. Furthermore, the migration from order-based to position-based logic provides a more intuitive, real-time overview of portfolio health. YOYO emphasized that 4.0 is not the finish line. The next phase involves integrating AI-driven strategies and expanding the elite trader ecosystem to ensure a sustainable, high-yield future for all participants. Annual Review: What Did HTX Futures Get Right in 2025? Looking back on the year soon coming to a close, YOYO described the trajectory of HTX Futures as one of “accumulative growth”. She revealed that the HTX Futures user base expanded by 2 to 3 times in 2025. According to YOYO, this growth was not fueled by short-term market tailwinds but was a natural outcome of users’ long-term trust in the platform. This trust is underpinned by two core strengths HTX has consistently reinforced over the year – its brand foundation and service capabilities. These strengths are increasingly being converted into sustainable, long-term competitive advantages for its futures business. Security and Risk Control: The Bedrock of Long-Term Trust First and foremost is HTX’s risk control and security system . For futures traders, security remains the single most critical factor in decision-making. YOYO noted that over the past 12 years, HTX has continuously strengthened and refined its risk-control system, building a comprehensive defense that spans user fund isolation, system stability, and resilience under extreme market conditions. Whether during the recent industry turbulence around October 11 or amid multiple periods of intense volatility earlier this year, HTX Futures experienced no major systemic risk incidents. Its proven resilience in maintaining stable operations through repeated real-world stress tests has become a fundamental pillar supporting long-term user trust. Liquidity Development: A Key Milestone for the Futures Business On liquidity, YOYO revealed that since April this year, HTX has achieved significant improvements in liquidity depth across major cryptocurrencies as well as selected secondary assets, with overall levels nearly doubling. This progress stands out as one of the most important developments for HTX Futures in 2025. She also admitted that there is still room for improvement in certain long-tail and trending assets. Moving forward, the team will continue to solidify the foundations of K2 and secondary assets while rolling out more diversified solutions to optimize liquidity across all assets. This capability, in turn, is set to become one of the most critical and enduring competitive moats of HTX’s futures business. Trading Speed and System Capabilities: Built for High-Frequency and Quantitative Traders For high-frequency and quantitative traders, execution speed and system performance are paramount. YOYO explained that in May 2025, HTX launched its Multi-Assets Collateral system, which not only supports cross-asset hedging strategies involving cryptocurrencies such as BTC and ETH but has also boosted API trading throughput by nearly fourfold. Today, a substantial portion of high-frequency quantitative trading activity on the platform has already migrated to this system. Meanwhile, the underlying matching infrastructure continues to undergo optimization. A brand-new matching engine is expected to go live in the first quarter of 2026, further enhancing the smoothness and stability of futures trading. A Financial Product Suite: Enhancing Capital Efficiency and User Retention While continuously strengthening its fundamental trading capabilities, HTX has steadily built out a more comprehensive financial product suite, now a key pillar for long-term user retention. Since the launch of SmartEarn in December 2024, HTX Futures has centered its efforts on enhancing capital utilization efficiency. Designed around low entry thresholds and flexible deposits and withdrawals, SmartEarn allows users to earn annualized yields simply by keeping funds in their USDT-M accounts. YOYO revealed that SmartEarn is set to undergo another major iteration in 2026. Without raising usage barriers, its annualized yield potential is expected to increase by 2–3 times. At the same time, HTX continues to upgrade both its grid trading and copy trading systems. The grid trading system was fully revamped in 2025, followed by the launch of Copy Trading 4.0 toward the end of the year. In 2026, the team will further ramp up investment in AI-powered strategy trading tools, including AI trading assistants and integrated strategy capabilities. It is dedicated to making proven, mature strategies accessible to users at a lower entry threshold, helping them pursue long-term, sustainable returns. YOYO emphasized that throughout its business growth, the HTX Futures team has remained committed to engaging directly with users, actively listening to authentic feedback across multiple channels, and using those insights as the primary engine for product optimization and iteration. This virtuous cycle has not only fostered increasingly deep user trust but has also become a solid foundation for business growth. At the same time, the team has consistently served every user with sincerity and dedication. Backed by strong group-level resource support for the futures business, it has become increasingly clear that the turnaround from user feedback to product iteration is getting faster. The Next Phase of Capacity Building for Futures Trading Looking ahead to 2026, the strategic direction of HTX Futures remains clear and focused – continuous product refinement, optimization of liquidity structures, improvements in capital efficiency, and deeper strengthening of risk-control frameworks to further solidify the foundational capabilities of the futures business. On this basis, an especially significant shift is now taking shape: exploring ways to return greater proactive risk-management control to users. In YOYO’s view, the platform’s responsibility extends beyond providing users with robust systems and baseline safety protections. Through product and mechanism design, it should also equip users with mature, clear, and actionable risk-management tools, enabling them to actively participate in managing their own trading risks with a full understanding of potential risks. This also means that, on top of existing system security and risk-control frameworks, HTX Futures will help users establish more transparent and controllable risk-management pathways, so that risk control is no longer a passive outcome, but an integral part of trading decision-making. Apparently, HTX Futures’ strategy goes beyond scale expansion, pointing instead toward a more mature trading infrastructure and a more clearly defined risk-management paradigm. From system-level product reconstruction to an evolution in risk-control philosophy, HTX Futures is seeking to answer a longer-term question: in a highly volatile crypto market, how can more users participate in futures trading in a more controlled, rational manner, and ultimately realize long-term value? This, perhaps, is where its true competitive edge in the next phase will lie.

Among them, ZBT topped the leaderboard with a 127% increase, underscoring the market’s renewed appetite for leading sectors. As 2025 draws to a close, sentiment across the crypto market continues to recover, with trading activity picking up alongside seasonal year-end momentum. A combination of macro tailwinds and renewed narrative catalysts has driven broad-based sector strength, as AI, privacy, and memecoin assets simultaneously rebound. Capital flows are increasingly gravitating toward high-growth narratives and thematically distinct opportunities. AI Narrative Returns to Center Stage as PAYAI and SQD Lead the Rally Artificial intelligence remains one of the defining long-term narratives of the 2025 crypto cycle, with accelerating real-world adoption driving a revaluation of application assets. One of the key catalysts behind this week’s AI-sector rebound was the official release of Version 2 of x402, an open-source payment protocol for AI agents developed by the Coinbase developer team. The upgraded x402 protocol introduces native multi-chain support, covering token payment on ecosystems such as Base and Solana. It also enables seamless integration with traditional payment rails including the Automated Clearing House (ACH) and bank card networks. This significantly enhances the commercial scalability of AI services. Following the release, assets across the x402 ecosystem saw significant gains. This validates a broader mid-cycle thesis for 2025: AI business models are transitioning from conceptual experimentation toward scalable, revenue-oriented deployment. HTX’s early support for core AI-linked assets provided users with timely access to this narrative-driven market opportunity. ● PAYAI (PayAI Network) : +103%, emerging as one of the strongest performers within the x402 AI ecosystem. Built on ElizaOS, libp2p, IPFS, and Solana, PayAI operates as an open-source, decentralized marketplace for AI agents. Growing market attention around model capability upgrades and ecosystem expansion plans have positioned PAYAI as a key proxy for speculative capital inflows into the AI sector. ● SQD (Subsquid) : +114%, reflecting renewed interest in AI-focused compute infrastructure. The SQD Network functions as a decentralized data lake and query engine, offering developers high-performance, permissionless access to on-chain data. Rising expectations around compute demand drove a valuation recovery, with narrative momentum and trading volume reinforcing one another. Privacy Protocols Regain Attention as ZBT and ZEC Advance in Tandem On-chain privacy is increasingly viewed as a foundational infrastructure for the next market cycle. Against a backdrop of regulatory recalibration and industry restructuring, the privacy sector has seen renewed inflows, forming a “new-and-legacy resonance” dynamic across assets. HTX’s diversified asset coverage has allowed users to participate across multiple layers of this narrative. ● ZBT (Zerobase) : +127%, ranking as the best performer overall. Zerobase is a decentralized cryptographic infrastructure network supporting products such as zkStaking, zkLogin, and ProofYield. It bridges institutional DeFi, user privacy protection, and real-world asset (RWA) strategies, combining privacy security with system verifiability and trust. ● ZEC (Zcash) : +22%. Zcash is a decentralized, open-source project, developed on the Zerocash Protocol published in the IEEE Security & Privacy conference in 2014. It leverages zero-knowledge proof technology and multi-address mechanism to ensure transaction anonymity. Memecoins Gain Momentum Across Multiple Ecosystems As the year-end approaches, seasonal memecoin trading activity has begun to resurface. Assets characterized by lightweight narratives and strong liquidity once again demonstrated their volatility-driven appeal. On HTX, several memecoins recorded notable gains, supported by efficient execution and deep liquidity that enabled users to capture short-term opportunities. ● DONKEY: +21%, a BSC-based memecoin with robust community engagement. The project originates from a social media post by Binance founder CZ, in which he referred to himself as a donkey. In Chinese culture, the donkey is seen as a symbol of hard work and diligence, representing those who work tirelessly. ● MYRO (Myro) : +29%, a Solana-based memecoin. Named after Myro, the dog of Solana co-founder Raj Gokal, the project pays tribute to both its namesake and the broader crypto community’s enduring affinity for dog-themed narratives. ● HIPPO (sudeng) : +33%, a memecoin within the SUI ecosystem. Created by community supporters to celebrate Sudeng, widely regarded as “the world’s cutest hippo,” the project has adopted a community-driven governance approach and donates part of its proceeds to global wildlife initiatives. Multi-Sector Recovery Including DeFi and Layer 1 Ecosystems Beyond headline narratives, a broader rally across DeFi and Layer 1 assets suggests improving incremental capital inflows and the potential continuation of a year-end market trend. ● 0G (Zero Gravity): +38%, positioned at the intersection of DeFi and AI. As a decentralized operating system for AI applications and blockchain, Zero Gravity coordinates hardware resources such as storage and computation alongside software assets including data and models, enabling the scalable handling of complex AI workloads. ● SPK (Spark) : +17%, supported by renewed capital inflows and improving protocol expectations. Spark operates as an on-chain capital allocator, currently deploying $3.86 billion across the DeFi, CeFi, and RWA sectors. Its automated, market-responsive allocation framework enhances capital efficiency while maintaining a conservative risk profile. ● XPL (Plasma): + 25%, a Layer 1 payment infrastructure project. Plasma is an EVM-compatible Layer 1 blockchain designed for high-throughput, low-cost global stablecoin payments. As ecosystem activity expands, traffic and usage expectations have continued to support price strength.

Speaking at the annual meeting of the Chinese People’s Political Consultative Conference, Jinping called the year “extraordinary” for China as it defied global pressures. “The growth rate is expected to reach around 5%, continuing to rank high among the world’s major economies,” he said. He pointed to a shift in focus: away from just growing fast, and toward improving quality and innovation. Xi also warned against “reckless” projects and backed slowing down in certain regions to avoid unnecessary risks. China’s factory and service activity shows signs of recovery Data is backing up his claim. The official manufacturing PMI for December hit 50.1, jumping past the breakeven mark and beating the 49.2 forecast. That’s also a rise from November’s 49.2. The composite PMI, which includes both manufacturing and services, rose to 50.7 from 49.7, a clear step into expansion territory. Services and construction aren’t sitting still either. The non-manufacturing PMI climbed to 50.2, up from 49.5 the month before. All of this points to a broader comeback after a rough patch earlier in the year. Huo Lihui from China’s National Bureau of Statistics said December saw a clear boost in new orders, marking a “significant expansion” in both supply and demand. The private sector backed that up too. A separate PMI by independent firm RatingDog reached 50.1 in December, up from 49.9. This also beat the expected figure of 49.8. Yao Yu, founder of RatingDog, said manufacturing is growing again. He said new orders have been rising for seven months straight, helped by product launches and more business activity. But Yao also said that while companies are still hopeful for 2026, their confidence has dropped below normal levels. Large firms grow faster while small ones stay behind The National Bureau of Statistics showed that large enterprises are leading the recovery, as their PMI jumped to 50.8, 1.5 points higher than the month before. Medium-sized firms edged up to 49.8, but that’s still below the growth line. Small businesses are still shrinking. Their index dropped to 48.6, a 0.5 point fall from November. Markets didn’t react with much cheer. The Hang Seng index in Hong Kong dropped 0.83%, while the CSI 300 on the mainland rose 0.33%. It’s a mixed read, as investors watch closely for more signs of long-term momentum. The numbers come just days after the central bank decided to leave loan prime rates unchanged, even as the economy struggles with weak demand and a housing sector mess. November’s retail sales and industrial output came in below forecasts. Even fixed asset investment fell, another sign the recovery still has holes. Meanwhile, Beijing is also trying to balance currency pressures. The yuan is allowed to inch up slowly, which keeps trading partners calm and blocks fast inflows of speculative cash. A stronger currency can help bring in cheaper imports and move China closer to its goal of making the yuan a global player.

This dual achievement represents a significant turning point for the world’s second-largest blockchain, demonstrating tangible progress in solving the long-standing scalability trilemma that has challenged decentralized networks for years. The record-breaking performance follows strategic network upgrades throughout 2024 and early 2025, fundamentally transforming Ethereum’s capacity and efficiency for millions of users worldwide. Ethereum Mainnet Transaction Milestone Analysis The Ethereum mainnet processed exactly 2,201,457 transactions on Tuesday, surpassing the previous record of 1.97 million set during the 2021 bull market peak. This 11.7% increase represents more than just numerical growth—it signals fundamental improvements in network architecture. Transaction throughput has increased consistently throughout 2025, with monthly averages showing 15% quarter-over-quarter growth since the beginning of the year. Network validators processed these transactions across 7,125 blocks, maintaining an average block time of 12.1 seconds throughout the 24-hour period. Several factors contributed to this transaction volume surge. Firstly, decentralized finance (DeFi) activity increased by 34% month-over-month, with lending protocols and decentralized exchanges accounting for 41% of all transactions. Secondly, non-fungible token (NFT) marketplaces experienced renewed interest, generating 18% of transaction volume. Thirdly, layer-2 solution bridging and settlement transactions represented 22% of the total, indicating healthy ecosystem integration. The remaining 19% comprised various smart contract executions, wallet interactions, and standard ETH transfers. Comparative Network Performance Metrics Metric 2023 Average 2024 Average 2025 Record Day Daily Transactions 1.1 million 1.6 million 2.2 million Average Fee $4.27 $1.43 $0.17 Success Rate 98.2% 99.1% 99.7% Peak TPS 32 45 68 Transaction Fee Reduction and Network Efficiency Concurrently with the transaction volume record, Ethereum mainnet average fees dropped to 17 cents, representing a 92% reduction from the $2.15 average observed just six months ago. This fee reduction occurred despite the increased network demand, contradicting traditional blockchain economic models where higher usage typically drives higher costs. The improved fee structure results directly from protocol-level optimizations implemented through recent upgrades, particularly enhancing gas efficiency and block space utilization. Gas optimization improvements include: EIP-7702 implementation : Reduced calldata costs by 40% for certain transaction types Blob storage efficiency : Increased data availability per block by 300% Validator optimization : Improved block proposal efficiency reducing orphaned blocks by 65% State management : Enhanced state access patterns decreasing computational overhead These technical improvements translate directly to user benefits. A standard ERC-20 token transfer now costs approximately $0.12 compared to $3.80 in early 2024. Similarly, complex DeFi interactions that previously cost $25-50 now average $1.20-2.50. This dramatic reduction makes Ethereum accessible for microtransactions and frequent interactions that were previously economically prohibitive. The Impact of Pectra and Fusaka Upgrades The Pectra upgrade, implemented in Q4 2024, introduced several critical improvements to Ethereum’s execution layer. Most significantly, it enhanced the EVM’s parallel processing capabilities, allowing validators to execute multiple transactions simultaneously when they don’t conflict. This change increased theoretical throughput by approximately 40% without compromising decentralization or security. The upgrade also introduced more efficient memory management and optimized precompiles for common cryptographic operations. Fusaka, deployed in Q1 2025, focused on consensus layer improvements. It implemented: Dynamic validator committees : Adjusting committee sizes based on network load Improved attestation aggregation : Reducing bandwidth requirements by 35% Enhanced fork choice rule : Decreasing finalization time from 12.8 to 9.2 minutes Validator lifecycle management : Streamlining entry and exit processes Together, these upgrades created synergistic effects. The execution layer improvements (Pectra) increased transaction processing capacity, while the consensus layer enhancements (Fusaka) ensured validators could keep pace with the increased load without compromising network security or decentralization. This coordinated approach represents Ethereum’s maturation from a monolithic upgrade philosophy to a modular improvement strategy addressing specific bottlenecks systematically. Network Health Indicators Beyond raw transaction numbers, several key indicators demonstrate Ethereum’s improved health. The network’s total value secured in staking contracts reached 42 million ETH, representing approximately 35% of circulating supply. This high participation rate enhances security while distributing validation responsibilities across more entities. Additionally, the client diversity ratio improved to 68% for execution clients and 72% for consensus clients, reducing systemic risks associated with client dominance. Layer-2 networks continue processing approximately 75% of Ethereum-related transactions off-chain while settling proofs on the mainnet. This symbiotic relationship has matured significantly, with L2s now contributing more than $850,000 daily in fee revenue to the mainnet while providing users with near-instant finality and microscopic fees. The record mainnet transactions occurred alongside approximately 8.2 million daily L2 transactions, demonstrating the multi-layer scaling approach’s effectiveness. Broader Ecosystem Implications and Future Outlook The transaction milestone and fee reduction have immediate implications across the blockchain ecosystem. Developers can now design applications with different economic assumptions, enabling business models previously impossible due to high transaction costs. Enterprise adoption barriers have lowered significantly, with corporate blockchain pilots reporting 80% reduction in operational costs compared to 2024 implementations. The improved metrics also strengthen Ethereum’s position in institutional evaluations, potentially influencing ETF approvals and traditional finance integration. Looking forward, several developments could further enhance Ethereum’s capabilities: Verkle trees implementation : Scheduled for late 2025, potentially reducing state size by 90% Single slot finality : Research progressing toward 12-second transaction finality Account abstraction expansion : Making blockchain interactions seamless for non-technical users Cross-rollup interoperability : Enabling seamless asset movement between layer-2 solutions The network’s improved performance comes at a crucial time as competition intensifies from alternative layer-1 blockchains and emerging scaling solutions. Ethereum’s response—improving base layer performance while maintaining decentralization and security—validates its long-term development philosophy. The record transactions and reduced fees demonstrate that protocol evolution, rather than revolutionary replacement, can successfully address scalability challenges. Conclusion The Ethereum mainnet achieving 2.2 million daily transactions with fees of just 17 cents represents a watershed moment for blockchain scalability. This achievement validates years of research and development, demonstrating that careful protocol evolution can dramatically improve network capacity while reducing user costs. The Pectra and Fusaka upgrades provided the technical foundation for this performance leap, optimizing both execution and consensus layers simultaneously. As Ethereum continues its development roadmap, these improvements establish a new baseline for what’s possible in decentralized network performance while maintaining the security and decentralization principles that define the ecosystem. The milestone confirms Ethereum’s ongoing relevance and adaptability in an increasingly competitive blockchain landscape. FAQs Q1: What caused Ethereum transaction fees to drop so dramatically? The fee reduction resulted primarily from the Pectra and Fusaka network upgrades, which improved gas efficiency, increased block space utilization, and optimized validator performance. These protocol-level changes allowed more transactions per block while reducing computational costs. Q2: How does this transaction volume compare to other major blockchains? Ethereum’s 2.2 million daily transactions place it among the most active major blockchains, though some specialized networks process higher volumes. More significantly, Ethereum achieves this while maintaining full decentralization and supporting complex smart contracts, unlike some higher-throughput networks with different trade-offs. Q3: Will transaction fees remain this low during periods of high demand? While fees will naturally fluctuate with demand, the network upgrades have permanently increased capacity and efficiency. Stress tests indicate fees should remain below $1 for most transactions even during demand spikes 300% higher than current levels, representing a fundamental improvement over previous network behavior. Q4: What impact do layer-2 solutions have on mainnet transaction volume? Layer-2 networks handle approximately 75% of Ethereum-related transactions off-chain while periodically settling proofs on the mainnet. This symbiotic relationship actually increases mainnet activity as L2s batch thousands of transactions into single mainnet settlements while paying fees that support network security. Q5: How does this affect Ethereum’s energy consumption and environmental impact? Since transitioning to proof-of-stake in 2022, Ethereum’s energy consumption has remained relatively constant despite transaction volume increases. The recent upgrades improve computational efficiency, potentially reducing energy per transaction by 15-20%, though exact measurements require further study as the changes stabilize.

This $0.04 DeFi Altcoin Could Lead 2026,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/next-cryptocurrency-to-30x-this-0-04-defi-altcoin-could-lead-2026/,"When investors are in demand for the next crypto to blow out of proportion, they often fail to realize that there is no screamer about it very often. Rather than hype, strong candidates generally tend to have consistent funding, definite product plans and increasing participation. With the debate on the most successful crypto to invest in today once more spreading the proliferation of conversations, the market analysts reckon that there are DeFi projects selling under $0.05 worth looking into. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is the name of one of such altcoins that received that attention. Presale Momentum Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is now valued at $0.04, and it has clearly risen to the group of potential best cheap cryptos to buy at the early stage among many investors. The presale system is determined by stages, and every stage has a fixed number of tokens allocated at a predetermined price. With more demand, the phases will close more rapidly and the pricing also will rise. Until now, Mutuum Finance has accumulated $19.5M, had 18,700 holders, and sold over 820M tokens. Out of the total 4B MUTM, 45.5% are distributed to the presale. This implies that much of it remains in distribution though pricing has already gone out. The presale began at $0.01 in early 2025. Early investors have also already MUTM appreciation as the token is currently priced at $0.04. Its price at the time of official launch is formulated at $0.06 which most observers consider to be a major psychological point. To the investors, who are comparing the cannot be made the same prices of crypto today, there is a difference between the price at $0.04 and those nearer to the launch. A $2,000 entry now secures 50,000 MUTM. This would only purchase a lot fewer tokens in the launch pricing. What Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is Creating Mutuum Finance is developing a lending protocol which is decentralized. The protocol enables users to provide assets and or raise yield or borrow based on collateral in a designed manner. The system will have a gradual scaling structure, where the rules will be adjusted to the market demand, not predetermined incentive. Assets are provided by users and they are rewarded with mtTokens. Such tokens are reflective of their status and increase in worth as borrowers pay up interest. This directly correlates protocol usage to user returns. The system adopted by Mutuum Finance is also buy-and-distribute. MUTM bought on the open market is redistributed to users who post mtTokens in the safety module. This is binding token demand onto real activity rather than short-term trade. Other observers think such an arrangement will encourage more healthy pricing over the long term. Security has been a priority. Mutuum Finance is rated at 90/100 CertiK Token Scan and the Halborn Security audit is complete, awaiting final update. Audits would also significantly help to weed out serious and risky projects to investors as they seek to know what crypto to invest in next. Price Outlook and Design The issue of comments revolves around stablecoins which form the basis of lending schemes since they make them less volatile and encourage a stable demand to borrow. Mutuum Finance is highly engaged in the use of stablecoins, which may fund the protocol even in the time when crypto charts may appear shaky. The protocol is meant to be based on sound oracle infrastructure, and the plans consist of Chainlink price feeds, fallback options, and aggregated data sources. Pricing of liquidations and collateral management requires appropriate pricing. The protocols with good oracle systems are said to be more resilient when markets move fast, therefore, industry speculation. On this basis, certain observers think that the progression of Mutuum Finance may be cautious to a bullish trend. In a measured case, the MUTM could protrude its initial launch price as the adoption increases. Under a bullish case, it is projected that in the long term of usage and revenue upsurge, a 10x to 15x improvement can be achieved. Whale Interest and V1 Launch The timeline of Mutuum Finance development is another factor why it is becoming one of the top crypto companies to watch. The team is getting ready in the V1 of the lending protocol, and it is expected to run on the Sepolia testnet. This enables the community to experience such features as liquidity pools, mtTokens, and liquidation logic with ETH and USDT. Phase 6 of the presale was quickly sold which channeled an evidence of an increasing demand. Large individual allocations have also been witnessed in recent updates on funding. Inclusion of whales is usually relevant since it implies trust in prolonged results instead of exchanges in the short-term. The investor activity in the first quarter shows that there is a shift in capital flow between better-developed tokens and newer projects in DeFi that have noticeable achievements. This change is significant to the crypto beginner who wants to purchase a crypto that has the potential to grow over time. When a protocol shifts further in its life cycle past presale to live testing, the story shifts usually to performance. As MUTM continues to sell under $0.1, its presale continues, and a beta launch is on the cards, Mutuum Finance is gaining growing popularity as a next cryptocurrency.

But now, under Trump’s second term, that protection is getting axed, as his budget director Russell Vought, who also runs the place, wants to shut it down completely. Investigations are being pushed over to the Justice Department, which wasn’t built to chase credit card scams or payday loan schemes. Trump, speaking about his decision at the White House , said, “It’s very important to get rid of the agency,” claiming that Senator Elizabeth Warren used it “as her little personal agency to go around and destroy people.” Elizabeth, who helped create the CFPB in 2010, fired back almost immediately, saying that she will fight back because “this is about enforcing the law as it is written, so that billionaires and billionaire corporations don’t cheat American families.” White House tries to fire workers and reroute enforcement The Trump administration is trying to fire as many as 90% of CFPB employees and stop the agency from getting more money. Vought, in an October podcast appearance, said he has no plans to keep it running. The Federal Reserve, which funds the CFPB, was told it needs to return to what the administration calls “profitability” before more money can be requested. That argument got tossed out by a federal judge this week, who called it legally baseless. But that hasn’t stopped the machine. In July, Congressional Republicans cut the CFPB’s max funding limit. Since then, a decade of consumer finance rules have been dismantled. We’re talking protections around student loans, credit card fees, mortgages, and overdraft charges. Most of the watchdog’s pending actions have either been paused or dropped altogether. Insiders are quitting. Oversight is crumbling. The agency has basically stopped checking in on the very industries it was made to watch. People who rely on the CFPB have noticed. Reuters spoke to lawyers, counselors, and broke Americans who said they’re scared. The agency was their only help against creditors who play dirty. With it fading, people with medical bills, job losses, or bad luck say they’ll be left alone with financial predators. Elizabeth Warren warns no other agency protects consumers first Elizabeth, reflecting on her time as a bankruptcy law professor, said the system used to be chaos. “I was stunned by the number of people in financial trouble who had lost a job or got sick but who had also been cheated by one or more of their creditors,” she said . She said no other agency put consumer protection first. Most agencies, she said, treated it as an afterthought, somewhere between fifth and tenth on the priority list. With no CFPB, people getting scammed have no backup. The agency used to go after shady lenders and hold them accountable. Now, Trump’s team wants that job shifted elsewhere, which critics say means nowhere. Meanwhile, over in China , the government is doing the exact opposite; pumping money into consumer protections. Xinhua, the country’s state media, reported that 62.5 billion yuan in long-term bond funds is being given to local governments to support a 2026 subsidy program. The plan gives Chinese citizens cash back when they swap out old fridges, TVs, and even bikes or cars. The country launched this scheme in 2024 to fight sluggish demand. It’s now being expanded. Li Chao, spokesperson for the National Development and Reform Commission, said the money is already going out to support the Spring Festival and New Year holiday spending. Buyers get 15% back when they replace appliances like washing machines or smartphones, capped at 500 yuan per item. If they trade in old cars, they can get 12% of the price of a new electric vehicle, up to 20,000 yuan. If they’re just upgrading to a newer clean vehicle, they still get 8%, maxing out at 15,000 yuan.

Here’s Why,https://timestabloid.com/analyst-says-xrp-price-could-dump-to-0-8-heres-why/,"A sequence of subtle shifts has been forming beneath XRP’s price action. Ali Martinez (@ali_charts), a well-respected analyst, believes these signs suggest a significant downward move for the asset. In a detailed X thread, Martinez walked through several charts that track participation, holder behavior, and price structure, suggesting the asset may fall to $0.80. Declining Network Participation Sets the Tone Martinez opened his analysis by focusing on network health rather than price candles. He expressed concern for declining engagement across the network. He stated that network activity has cooled noticeably . Daily active addresses have dropped to approximately 38,500, which he described as evidence of waning participation and interest. Lower address counts often reflect fewer transactions and reduced usage, conditions that can weaken price support over time. The analyst linked to an XRP Network Activity chart that showed a steady decline, reinforcing his point. Here’s why $XRP could be at risk of a drop to $0.80. — Ali Charts (@alicharts) December 29, 2025 Whale Selling Adds Supply Pressure After addressing participation, Martinez turned to large holders. He noted a clear shift in whale behavior during the same period. Rather than accumulating XRP, these wallets appear to be reducing exposure. “At the same time, whales have turned into sellers,” Martinez said. He added that they have been “offloading more than 40 million XRP in recent days.” The XRP Held by Whales chart supported this claim, showing a visible reduction in balances among large addresses . This combination of falling network activity and whale selling can create a difficult environment for price growth. When large holders distribute tokens into a market with declining demand, downside pressure can build quickly. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Key Price Levels Come Into Focus With these conditions in place, Martinez outlined the technical levels that now matter most. He identified $1.77 as a critical support zone. “If selling pressure continues, XRP risks losing the $1.77 support,” he wrote. He explained that a breakdown at this level would be significant. “A breakdown here opens the door to the next major support zone near $0.80,” Martinez said. This level appeared repeatedly throughout the thread as a key downside area if current trends persist. Martinez used a volume-based distribution chart to reinforce his view. “Below $1.77, the next meaningful area of support for XRP is $0.79 ,” he stated. The chart highlighted this region as an area where past buying activity has concentrated. Disclaimer : This content is meant to inform and should not be considered financial advice.

Key Takeaways: Family offices expanded crypto exposure in 2025, with many making first-time allocations. Bitcoin and Ether remain the main entry points as improved infrastructure offsets limited in-house expertise. Market volatility and weak prices are tempering expectations for broader adoption in 2026. However, sharp price swings and weak recent performance are raising doubts about how far that momentum can carry into 2026, according to a report by Financial News . “Family offices moved from ‘crypto experimenters’ to structured allocators [in 2025], allocating modest but growing percentages of wealth to digital assets,” Muhammed Yesilhark, chief investment officer at NOIA Capital, told the outlet. Family Offices Favor Bitcoin and Ether as Infrastructure Improves Yesilhark added that most allocations focused on areas where infrastructure, custody solutions and risk controls had improved. Despite broader interest, Bitcoin and Ether remained the main entry points, reflecting limited in-house crypto expertise at many family offices. Survey data points to a rapid rise in engagement. A study by BNY Mellon published in October found that 74% of ultra-high-net-worth family offices are now investing in or actively exploring cryptocurrencies, up 21 percentage points from the previous year. Market participants say that increase was driven not just by price cycles, but by a more developed ecosystem around custody, compliance and regulated investment vehicles. Family offices are doing a complete 180 on crypto and are treating it like infrastructure. And the speed of that shift tells you something about where serious money is actually headed https://t.co/ukFGXvEcKg 1/23 — Digital Ascension Group (@DAGFamilyOffice) December 28, 2025 Chris Rhine, head of liquid active strategies at Galaxy Digital, said his firm saw a noticeable wave of first-time allocations this year. Many family offices, he noted, conducted detailed due diligence before committing capital, signaling a longer-term approach rather than opportunistic trading. That cautious entry did not stop some high-profile moves. Hong Kong-based family office VMS made its first crypto investment by backing digital asset hedge fund Re7 with $10 million. Separately, the family office of Arthur Hayes is planning to raise $250 million for its first crypto-focused private equity fund, underscoring growing institutional confidence in the sector’s infrastructure layer. IPO Revival Could Pull Family Offices Deeper Into Crypto in 2026 Looking ahead, Pete Najarian, founder and managing partner of Raptor Digital, expects crypto to take up a larger share of family office portfolios in 2026, especially if public markets reopen for digital asset firms. A more active IPO pipeline , he said, could draw interest from families seeking exposure through exchange-traded funds and other regulated vehicles. Still, recent market conditions have tempered enthusiasm. The crypto market has shed more than $1 trillion in capitalization since October, with Bitcoin and Ether each down over 30%. One UAE-based family office representative said the volatility has pushed some investors to favor steadier assets such as real estate. “We are still far from broader adoption,” the person said. Yesilhark argued that success in 2026 will hinge on discipline. Family offices that focus on infrastructure, selective bets and strong underwriting, rather than short-term speculation, are more likely to stay committed through the next cycle.

The Chinese yuan emerges as the region’s top performer, while the Japanese yen remains surprisingly flat. Meanwhile, the Indian rupee bucks the broader regional trend with unexpected movements that have captured market attention. This comprehensive analysis examines the complex factors driving these divergent currency performances across Asia’s major economies. Asian Currencies Deliver Strong Yearly Performance Amid Global Shifts Throughout 2024, Asian currencies demonstrated remarkable resilience against global economic headwinds. Regional central banks implemented coordinated policies that stabilized exchange rates. Furthermore, improved trade balances across multiple Asian nations supported currency valuations. The region’s economic recovery outpaced many Western economies, attracting substantial foreign investment flows. Consequently, capital inflows strengthened local currencies against major global benchmarks. Market analysts note that this represents a significant shift from the previous three years of currency weakness across Asia. Several structural factors contributed to this positive performance. Manufacturing exports from Southeast Asia increased by 8.3% year-over-year. Additionally, technology sector growth in Taiwan and South Korea boosted their respective currencies. Regional tourism recovery also provided support, particularly for currencies in Thailand and Singapore. Most importantly, reduced inflation pressures allowed central banks to maintain supportive monetary policies. These combined elements created a favorable environment for Asian currency appreciation throughout 2024. Chinese Yuan Emerges as Regional Top Performer The Chinese yuan achieved the strongest gains among Asian currencies in 2024, appreciating approximately 6.2% against the US dollar. This performance reflects China’s successful economic rebalancing efforts. The People’s Bank of China implemented measured interventions that stabilized the currency. Moreover, increased international usage of the yuan for trade settlements supported its value. China’s current account surplus expanded to $68 billion in the third quarter alone. Foreign investors also increased their holdings of Chinese government bonds by 14% year-over-year. Several specific developments drove the yuan’s outperformance. China’s digital currency initiatives gained significant traction internationally. The country’s technology exports maintained strong growth despite global headwinds. Additionally, strategic commodity stockpiling reduced import volatility. Most notably, bilateral trade agreements with Middle Eastern nations increased yuan-denominated transactions. These factors combined to create sustained demand for the Chinese currency throughout 2024. Expert Analysis on Yuan’s Structural Strengthening Financial institutions have documented the yuan’s evolving role in global markets. The International Monetary Fund reports increased yuan holdings in global reserves. Furthermore, regional trade blocs now incorporate yuan settlement mechanisms. Currency strategists highlight reduced capital outflow pressures compared to previous years. China’s financial market liberalization also attracted long-term institutional investors. These structural changes suggest the yuan’s strength may extend beyond short-term cyclical factors. Japanese Yen Remains Surprisingly Flat Despite Policy Shifts The Japanese yen displayed unusual stability throughout 2024, ending the year essentially flat against the US dollar. This performance surprised many analysts who anticipated volatility. The Bank of Japan maintained its ultra-accommodative monetary policy stance for most of the year. However, subtle adjustments to yield curve control created market uncertainty. Japan’s persistent trade deficit continued to pressure the currency, while tourism recovery provided some offsetting support. Several competing forces created the yen’s flat trajectory. Foreign investment in Japanese equities reached record levels in early 2024. Meanwhile, Japanese investors increased overseas bond purchases significantly. The currency’s traditional safe-haven status diminished during global market stability periods. Additionally, Japan’s aging demographic profile continued to influence long-term currency outlooks. These conflicting dynamics resulted in minimal net movement for the yen throughout the year. Indian Rupee Bucks Regional Trend with Unique Trajectory The Indian rupee followed a distinct path that diverged from broader Asian currency trends in 2024. While most regional currencies appreciated, the rupee experienced periods of unexpected volatility. India’s central bank implemented strategic interventions to manage exchange rate stability. The country’s strong economic growth attracted substantial foreign direct investment. However, elevated oil import costs created persistent current account pressure. These competing factors created a complex trading environment for the rupee throughout the year. Several India-specific developments influenced the rupee’s unique performance. The country’s digital payment infrastructure expansion reduced currency demand for certain transactions. Additionally, India’s increasing integration into global supply chains affected trade flows. Foreign portfolio investors demonstrated changing patterns in their Indian market participation. Most significantly, India’s domestic consumption growth created different import-export dynamics compared to other Asian economies. These distinctive characteristics explain why the rupee followed its own trajectory in 2024. Comparative Performance Analysis of Major Asian Currencies The table below illustrates the yearly performance of key Asian currencies against the US dollar in 2024: Currency Yearly Change (%) Key Influencing Factors Chinese Yuan +6.2 Trade surplus, digital currency adoption, foreign investment Japanese Yen +0.3 Policy uncertainty, tourism recovery, trade deficit Indian Rupee -1.8 Oil imports, strong growth, central bank intervention South Korean Won +4.7 Technology exports, semiconductor recovery Singapore Dollar +3.9 Financial hub status, regional trade growth This comparative data reveals several important patterns. Technology-exporting nations generally performed well. Meanwhile, commodity-importing economies faced greater challenges. Currency performance correlated strongly with each country’s specific economic structure. The data also shows how regional integration created some performance convergence. However, domestic policy decisions remained crucial determinants of individual currency trajectories. Global Context and Future Outlook for Asian Currencies The strong yearly performance of Asian currencies occurred within a complex global environment. The US Federal Reserve’s monetary policy decisions created important cross-currents throughout 2024. European economic challenges also influenced capital flows toward Asian markets. Furthermore, commodity price fluctuations affected different Asian economies unevenly. Geopolitical developments created both risks and opportunities for regional currencies. These global factors interacted with domestic conditions to produce the observed currency performances. Looking toward 2025, several trends warrant close monitoring. The potential normalization of global interest rate differentials may affect capital flows. Additionally, evolving trade patterns could reshape currency demand across Asia. Technological advancements in payment systems might alter traditional currency usage patterns. Climate-related economic transitions will likely influence different Asian economies unevenly. Most importantly, demographic shifts across the region will continue affecting long-term currency fundamentals. Conclusion Asian currencies delivered strong yearly gains in 2024, with the Chinese yuan leading regional performance as the top gainer. The Japanese yen remained surprisingly flat despite significant policy developments, while the Indian rupee bucked the broader trend with its unique trajectory. These currency movements reflect complex interactions between domestic economic conditions, policy decisions, and global market forces. The divergent performances highlight Asia’s economic diversity and the region’s evolving role in global financial markets. As Asian economies continue developing, their currencies will likely play increasingly important roles in international finance and trade settlement systems. FAQs Q1: Why did the Chinese yuan perform so strongly in 2024? The yuan benefited from China’s trade surplus expansion, increased international usage for settlements, foreign investment inflows, and successful economic rebalancing efforts. Digital currency initiatives and strategic commodity management also provided support. Q2: What factors kept the Japanese yen flat throughout the year? Conflicting forces including foreign equity investment, overseas bond purchases by Japanese investors, diminished safe-haven demand, persistent trade deficits, and Bank of Japan policy uncertainty created offsetting pressures that resulted in minimal net movement. Q3: How did the Indian rupee differ from other Asian currencies? The rupee experienced unique volatility due to India’s strong economic growth attracting investment while elevated oil imports created current account pressure, resulting in a trajectory that diverged from the broader regional appreciation trend. Q4: What role did central banks play in Asian currency performance? Regional central banks implemented coordinated stabilization policies, strategic interventions, and measured monetary approaches that helped maintain currency stability while supporting economic recovery across different Asian economies. Q5: Could these currency trends continue into 2025? While past performance doesn’t guarantee future results, structural factors including trade patterns, investment flows, policy decisions, and global economic conditions will determine whether these currency trends persist or reverse in the coming year.

The Chinese tech firm’s 2026 budget has surpassed that of 2025, which was 85 billion Yuan (~$12.15B), although the final figure has yet to be confirmed. Furthermore, it remains to be confirmed whether Nvidia can sell its H200 GPUs (Graphics Processing Units) in China, as the recently lifted ban has yet to take full effect. Meanwhile, the company’s in-house chip manufacturing division has made significant progress in producing a lower-cost China-tailored chip that matches the performance of Nvidia H200 chips. ByteDance, which runs Douyin and TikTok, has a market capitalization of $500 billion and has established a chip design unit that employs over 1,000 workers. The company has further invested heavily in pursuing a mix of internal developments, like memory technologies such as high-bandwidth memory. It is also aggressively staking in related startups. Doubao processed over 50T tokens daily this month ByteDance’s Doubao chatbot processed over 50 trillion tokens daily in December alone, up from 4 trillion in December last year. The company said earlier this month that it is scaling back the capabilities of its agentic AI on its AI-powered smartphone. Meanwhile, Volcano Engine is set to serve as the exclusive AI cloud partner of the Spring Festival Gala sponsored by China’s most viewed television broadcast, China Central Television. Volcan Engine’s president, Tai Dai, recently said the platform has more than 100 corporate clients who have spent over 1 trillion tokens to date. According to the SCMP, ByteDance’s chip division is also working closely with its frontier AI research team, Seed. The chip unit was relocated to Picoheart, a Singapore-incorporated subsidiary, in September amid escalating U.S.-China geopolitical tensions. Some of the company’s staff from mainland China were requested to relocate to Singapore to undertake sensitive tasks. Meanwhile, Nvidia hopes to export its newly approved H200 chips to Chinese customers before the Lunar New Year, which falls in late January or early February. Chinese tech companies have shown growing interest in the processor, which is Nvidia’s second-most powerful chip. However, Beijing has not yet approved any purchases, and the timeline could change depending on regulatory progress. ByteDance to order $5.7B worth of Huawei chips in 2026 ByteDance has also announced plans to order $5.7 billion worth of Huawei Ascend processors in 2026, as Huawei and Nvidia wrestle fiercely in the global AI space. A recent Huawei report suggested that Chinese firms are increasingly opting for local products over foreign ones as geopolitical tensions escalate. The report further reveals that ByteDance is about to receive its first batch of Huawei Ascend chips worth at least tens of billions of Yuans. It is also rumored that the company is inspecting a sample of Huawei chips, although it has not confirmed if it will make any orders. Meanwhile, the large-scale increase in local computing power is driven by the computing power gap that emerged in April after restrictions on Nvidia H200 chips were implemented. It is also driven by the explosive growth in the number of token calls for ByteDance’s AI application and cloud computing business. ByteDance is reportedly in the process of deepening ties with Huawei, as relying on Nvidia has proven too risky. Foreign chips can either be used to spy on China’s data or compromise consumer data privacy. Meng Wanzhou, Huawei’s CFO, has commended her company’s progress, adding that it has built a strong foundation this year after the expansions to both its Ascend and Kunpeng AI chips. She further pointed out that Ascend AI chips now have over four million developers, along with over 3,000 partners. The smartest crypto minds already read our newsletter. Want in?

One of the cryptocurrencies involved in the process is Cardano (ADA), whose price has plunged by 3.5% on December 30. Bye-Bye to These Pairs Binance revealed that it will delist the following cross-margin pairs: BCH/FDUSD, TAO/FDUSD, AVAX/FDUSD, LTC/FDUSD, SUI/FDUSD, ADA/FDUSD, and LINK/FDUSD on January 6. It will also remove the isolated margin pairs involving the same cryptocurrencies on that date. “Effective immediately, users will no longer be able to transfer any amount of assets of the aforementioned pair(s) via manual transfers and Auto-Transfer Mode into their Isolated Margin accounts. If users hold outstanding liabilities of said tokens, these users may only manually transfer up to the amount of liabilities of that token into their Isolated Margin accounts, less any collateral already available,” the announcement reads. The common denominator across all trading pairs that are about to be removed is the stablecoin First Digital USD (FDUSD), with Binance failing to provide a reason for its decision. The non-stablecoin cryptocurrencies experienced little to no volatility following the news. Usually, more substantial moves are observed when a coin is initially listed or when all services involving a certain token are terminated. The Previous Updates Approximately a week ago, the exchange released another update affecting Cardano traders. This time, it opened trading for ADA/USD1 as well as the pairs ASTER/USD1, LUNA/USDC, LUNC/USDC, and ZEC/USD1 on Binance Spot. The new service is not available to all clients, as those residing in the United States, Canada, Cuba, Iran, the Netherlands, and other countries are excluded. Following the announcement, ADA’s price rose by 4%, while ASTER pumped by 3.5%. For its part, LUNA experienced a double-digit increase. At the start of December, Binance announced the removal of StaFi (FIS), REI Network (REI), and Voxies (VOXEL). The prices of the affected assets headed south after the news. The same thing happened in October when the company terminated all services with Flamingo (FLM), Kadena (KDA), and Perpetual Protocol (PERP). KDA took a major blow with its valuation crashing by around 30% following the statement.

Start With the Right License,https://timestabloid.com/the-smart-way-to-launch-a-crypto-business-start-with-the-right-license/,"The crypto industry may have started with rebels and code, but it’s maturing fast. Today, the most successful ventures are built on something surprisingly traditional: legal clarity. No matter the business model, long-term success in crypto takes more than a smart idea. It requires the right license in a jurisdiction that fits the business. In this article, we’ll explore why proper licensing is essential and why working with an experienced consulting partner can make all the difference. Why Licensing Is a Growth Decision, Not a Checkbox In crypto, regulation is no longer a future problem. It’s now baked into how serious businesses operate. Choosing the right crypto license does more than satisfy regulators. It signals professionalism to banks, payment providers, and users. It opens doors for partnerships and cross-border expansion. And it protects founders from the kind of legal uncertainty that can shut things down overnight. But licensing is determined by the company’s business model, services, and geographical location – so choose wisely. Choosing the Right Jurisdiction Matters Regulatory approaches vary. Some countries encourage fast innovation, others focus on tighter control. Each jurisdiction brings its own speed, rules, and level of oversight. Fintech Harbor Consulting Ltd. helps businesses pinpoint the option that best fits their objectives. Below are some standout choices to explore. Poland: Fast Entry, Local Strength Poland has become a practical entry point for crypto exchanges and custody providers looking to operate within the EU. Its regulatory setup is clear and accessible, with a licensing process that moves faster than many alternatives. The Poland crypto exchange license enables businesses to register as VASPs while remaining aligned with wider European requirements. It’s an ideal setup for early-stage companies that want legal standing in the EU without navigating the full licensing weight of larger markets like Germany or France. Switzerland: Trusted, Tested, and Crypto-Ready With a long-standing reputation for financial integrity, Switzerland has become a natural home for serious crypto ventures. Its regulators don’t just tolerate blockchain—they’ve built a clear, structured environment for it to thrive. Tokenization and blockchain companies frequently turn to Switzerland for its stable, business-friendly climate. A Switzerland crypto license not only ensures compliance, but it also increases confidence with investors and partners. CASP License: A New Chapter in European Crypto Compliance For years, crypto businesses in the EU had to juggle a patchwork of local laws—what worked in one country didn’t always fly in the next. MiCA changes the game. It introduces one unified set of rules across the region, and the CASP license is the key to unlocking it. With this license in hand, companies can finally scale across Europe without rewriting the playbook for every border. For companies aiming to scale in Europe, it’s becoming a must-have. Canada: Regulated, But Still Open for Business Canada strikes a balance between strong regulation and innovation. It’s a promising option for companies that want to operate in a North American market without the volatility of U.S. policy shifts. A crypto license in Canada requires compliance with FINTRAC rules and registration as a money services business (MSB). While more formal than some jurisdictions, the structure offers long-term credibility—especially for exchanges and wallet providers. The Consultant Advantage Getting a crypto license isn’t just ticking boxes—it’s paperwork, structure, and strict compliance. One wrong step can stall everything. Fintech Harbor Consulting cuts through the complexity, guiding businesses through each stage with precision. With them, companies move forward confidently, backed by a license that’s done right from day one. Solid licensing is the backbone of any credible crypto business. It earns confidence, keeps liabilities in check, and makes expansion possible. Long-term success is about having a well-planned route through the regulatory landscape.

56634240,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=886584,1767167939,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/56634240.jpeg,About 10% of Europe’s banking workforce faces AI threat by 2030,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/ai-disruption-threatens-200000-europe-jobs/,"About 10% of banking jobs across Europe could disappear by 2030 as lenders lean harder on AI, with analysts saying that more than 200,000 roles are now exposed over the next five years. The forecast comes from Morgan Stanley, which reviewed 35 banks employing around 2.12 million people combined. A straight 10% workforce reduction equals roughly 212,000 job cuts. The expected job cuts focus on central services, meaning back-office roles, middle-office teams, risk management, and compliance units; basically the parts of banks where automation replaces repeat work fastest. Banks are targeting central service jobs for AI replacement operations Morgan Stanley said many lenders expect efficiency to increase by as much as 30% from AI and deeper digital use. Banks have already started acting too, like in November, Dutch lender ABN Amro said it plans to cut about 20% of its full-time workforce by 2028. In March, Société Générale chief executive Slawomir Krupa warned that “nothing is sacred” as the French bank tries to shrink a stubborn cost base. Morgan Stanley analysts said AI helps improve cost-to-income ratios, one of the most watched metrics by investors. These ratios remain high at many consumer-focused lenders, especially in France and Germany. Branch networks remain expensive. Digital channels are cheaper. AI fits directly into that math. Across Europe , banks serving retail customers face the biggest shake-up as more services shift to apps and automated platforms. The surge in AI use has also sparked fear well beyond banking. Several industries already face job losses as software replaces people. Financial services sit near the top of that list. Analysts warn that this wave will not stay limited to support teams. Over time, more functions could be affected as systems grow more capable. Executives warn speed matters as training risks grow At UBS, analysts say AI already changes how banks present themselves to clients. The firm has started turning analysts into digital avatars, sending recorded AI-generated videos to customers. Jason Napier, head of European banks research at UBS, said banks have not yet delivered clear efficiency gains, as cost bases remain large and powerful tools are still early in deployment. Napier added that anyone doubting AI’s impact should spend time testing tools already available. UBS also sent 250 senior leaders to Oxford University for an AI leadership summit in recent months. The goal was to prepare top executives for wider rollout decisions. Still, caution exists. Conor Hillery, co-chief executive for Europe, the Middle East, and Africa at JPMorgan Chase, warned banks not to move too fast. He said leaders must avoid losing sight of core skills while rushing toward automation. JPMorgan aims to use AI to speed up basic work while still training junior staff in fundamentals like cash flow models and price-to-earnings ratios. Hillery said failing to balance both could create future problems.

56634047,649778,1767168002,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/56634047.jpeg,The Future Of Tech: How Blockchain AI And Will Converge By Late 2026,https://bitcoinist.com/how-blockchain-ai-and-will-converge-by-late-2026/,"In a recent piece penned for Entrepreneur, Sandeep Nailwal, the co-founder and CEO of Layer 2 (L2) blockchain Polygon (POL), has made a bold prediction for the technological landscape of 2026. Nailwal envisions a major convergence of blockchain, artificial intelligence (AI), and payment technologies that could potentially “reshape the internet completely.” Blockchain’s Transparency Solution In Nailwal’s vision , AI would assume the role of decision-maker within this cohesive structure. Blockchains would then verify these decisions, ensuring their authenticity, while the payment infrastructure would facilitate the seamless transfer of value to enforce these decisions instantaneously. The fusion of these technologies is poised to have far-reaching implications. Nailwal highlights the role of AI in shaping various aspects of daily life and business operations, from content curation to supply chain logistics and financial decision-making. However, the opacity surrounding artificial intelligence systems poses a challenge, with limited transparency into the decision-making process and data integrity. Blockchains emerge as a solution to this transparency issue, offering a public ledger that provides visibility into transactions, models, and decisions. The security protocols inherent in blockchain technology not only safeguard digital signatures but also verify algorithmic outputs, instilling trust in the decision-making process. Nailwal emphasizes the importance of zero-knowledge proofs (ZKPs) protocols in ensuring transparency without compromising data privacy, allowing for the verification of rules and decisions without revealing sensitive underlying information. Future Of Digital Wallets According to Nailwal’s thesis, the transition from trust-based systems to proof-based systems has already begun, with governments using blockchain platforms to anchor public records and maintain transparency and accountability. Additionally, blockchain payment systems are being trialed by cities worldwide for various applications, from tax collection to cross-border transfers , ushering in a new era of efficiency and security in financial transactions. The evolution of payment systems is another area of focus, with digital currencies poised to streamline cross-border transactions by eliminating intermediaries. Nailwal noted platforms like Polygon, which are currently facilitating seamless stablecoin payments, offering swift and cost-effective transfers for individuals and businesses globally. Furthermore, Nailwal anticipates a future where digital wallets consolidate identity, data, and financial assets, simplifying everyday tasks like payments and document signings. The convergence of AI, blockchain, and payment technologies is expected to redefine user experiences, seamlessly integrating trust mechanisms into daily interactions. Nailwal concluded: The greatest technology shift of 2026 won’t be a new chain or a new model but the unceremonious formation of the converged internet, an infrastructure that can think, verify and pay on its own. Most people won’t notice the change. They’ll just find that the digital world suddenly works as it should — seamlessly. At the time of writing, Polygon’s native token, POL, was trading at $0.1025. This represents year-to-date losses of almost 80%, and 92% compared to the all-time high of $1.29.

As 2025 draws to a close, sentiment across the crypto market continues to recover, with trading activity picking up alongside seasonal year-end momentum. A combination of macro tailwinds and renewed narrative catalysts has driven broad-based sector strength, as AI, privacy, and memecoin assets simultaneously rebound. Capital flows are increasingly gravitating toward high-growth narratives and thematically distinct opportunities. AI Narrative Returns to Center Stage as PAYAI and SQD Lead the Rally Artificial intelligence remains one of the defining long-term narratives of the 2025 crypto cycle, with accelerating real-world adoption driving a revaluation of application assets. One of the key catalysts behind this week’s AI-sector rebound was the official release of Version 2 of x402, an open-source payment protocol for AI agents developed by the Coinbase developer team. The upgraded x402 protocol introduces native multi-chain support, covering token payment on ecosystems such as Base and Solana. It also enables seamless integration with traditional payment rails including the Automated Clearing House (ACH) and bank card networks. This significantly enhances the commercial scalability of AI services. Following the release, assets across the x402 ecosystem saw significant gains. This validates a broader mid-cycle thesis for 2025: AI business models are transitioning from conceptual experimentation toward scalable, revenue-oriented deployment. HTX’s early support for core AI-linked assets provided users with timely access to this narrative-driven market opportunity. PAYAI (PayAI Network) : +103%, emerging as one of the strongest performers within the x402 AI ecosystem. SQD (Subsquid) : +114%, reflecting renewed interest in AI-focused compute infrastructure. Privacy Protocols Regain Attention as ZBT and ZEC Advance in Tandem On-chain privacy is increasingly viewed as a foundational infrastructure for the next market cycle. Against a backdrop of regulatory recalibration and industry restructuring, the privacy sector has seen renewed inflows, forming a “new-and-legacy resonance” dynamic across assets. HTX’s diversified asset coverage has allowed users to participate across multiple layers of this narrative. ZBT (Zerobase) : +127%, ranking as the best performer overall. ZEC (Zcash) : +22%. Zcash is a decentralized, open-source project. Memecoins Gain Momentum Across Multiple Ecosystems As the year-end approaches, seasonal memecoin trading activity has begun to resurface. Assets characterized by lightweight narratives and strong liquidity once again demonstrated their volatility-driven appeal. On HTX, several memecoins recorded notable gains, supported by efficient execution and deep liquidity that enabled users to capture short-term opportunities. DONKEY: +21%, a BSC-based memecoin with robust community engagement. MYRO (Myro) : +29%, a Solana-based memecoin. HIPPO (sudeng) : +33%, a memecoin within the SUI ecosystem. Multi-Sector Recovery Including DeFi and Layer 1 Ecosystems Beyond headline narratives, a broader rally across DeFi and Layer 1 assets suggests improving incremental capital inflows and the potential continuation of a year-end market trend. 0G (Zero Gravity): +38%, positioned at the intersection of DeFi and AI. SPK (Spark) : +17%, supported by renewed capital inflows and improving protocol expectations. XPL (Plasma): + 25%, a Layer 1 payment infrastructure project. Seize Early-Stage Opportunities as HTX Captures Emerging Wealth Effects As market conditions stabilize, sector differentiation remains pronounced. Selecting the right trading venue, featuring forward-looking asset reserves and deep liquidity, has become increasingly critical for users seeking opportunities in the new market cycle. Across this week’s top-performing assets, HTX had already enabled trading access at their early stages, allowing users to grasp more entry points. Through disciplined listing strategies and a robust trading ecosystem, HTX continues to enhance users’ ability to capture opportunities efficiently amid complex market dynamics. Looking ahead, HTX will continue to evolve its platform strategy in line with market trends, user demand, and cycle-driven shifts, expanding high-quality asset coverage and deepening liquidity.

In 2027, it will range between $19.33 and $25.91, with an average price of $20.18. In 2030, it will range between $79.95 and $99.65, with an average price of $82.60. The Aptos blockchain has aggressively attracted capital into its ecosystem, with its total value locked ( TVL ) rising above $800 million. Aptos is a high-performance layer-1 blockchain with a mature ecosystem comprising a variety of decentralized finance (DeFi) applications. Aptos network continues to build decentralized applications and tools for developers. But how about APT’s performance? How high will it go? Is APT a good investment? Let’s explore these questions in our Cryptopolitan price predictions from 2025 to 2031. Overview Cryptocurrency Aptos Symbol APT Current price $1.69 Aptos crypto market cap $1.27B Trading volume $105.83M Circulating supply 749.87M All-time high $19.90 on Jan 30, 2023 All-time low $2.22 on Oct 11, 2025 24-hour high $1.75 24-hour low $1.68 Aptos price prediction: Technical analysis Metric Value Volatility (30-day variation) 7.28% 50-day SMA $2.12 200-day SMA $4.05 Current APT crypto sentiment Bearish Green days 13/30 (43%) Fear and Greed Index 21 (Extreme Fear) Aptos price analysis At press time, December 31, Aptos traded at $1.69, up 0.84% in the previous 24 hours but down 6.80% in the last 30 days. Its trading volume rose by 15.90% over the previous 24-hours to $105.83M. Aptos 1-day chart price APTUSD chart by TradingView Aptos formed a bearish harami candle pattern in October, resulting in a major 24-hour drop to $0.747 from $5.12. It then made a quick correction above the $2.50 support level. The coin, however, maintained a bearish stance and continues to drop. The histograms (0.048) indicate positive market momentum. The William Alligator trendlines show that its volatility is dropping. Aptos 4-hour chart price analysis APTUSD chart by TradingView The 4-hour chart, like the daily chart, shows a neutral market with little volatility. The chart has formed red MACD histograms, indicating bearish momentum over the short term. Traders, however, are waiting to see if it breaks the $2.00 resistance level. Aptos technical indicators: Levels and action Daily simple moving average (SMA) Period Value ($) Action SMA 3 2.59 SELL SMA 5 2.27 SELL SMA 10 2.01 SELL SMA 21 1.81 SELL SMA 50 2.12 SELL SMA 100 2.98 SELL SMA 200 4.05 SELL Daily exponential moving average (EMA) Period Value ($) Action EMA 3 1.82 SELL EMA 5 2.09 SELL EMA 10 2.69 SELL EMA 21 3.38 SELL EMA 50 4.02 SELL EMA 100 4.46 SELL EMA 200 5.19 SELL What to expect from the APT price analysis next? According to the technical indicators, APT is bearish. On the charts, its momentum is neutral, and its volatility has dropped. Why is Aptos down? Aptos unlocked $19.8M tokens on December 12, releasing ~11.6M APT (1.5% of market cap) to core contributors, investors, and the community. New coins risk diluting the value of the coin. Recent news Binance Academy has launched a free online course in collaboration with Aptos Labs and the Aptos Foundation, designed for builders and enthusiasts of the network. Users who complete the course will share 3,500 APT in token vouchers. Will Aptos reach $10? Yes, Aptos rose above $10 this year. The move will come as the market recovers to previous highs.

Aptos historic price sentiment APT price history by CoinGecko Aptos raised seed funding in January 2022, led by a16z. Series A funding included Apollo, Dragonfly, Franklin Templeton, and others. Some members previously worked on the Diem blockchain proposed by Facebook. The Aptos mainnet launched in October 2022 with an initial supply of 1 billion tokens. After the launch hype, Apt fell to its lowest in December 2022, at $3.09. A month later, the tables turned, as it peaked at a time high of $19.90 on January 30, 2023. It pumped, partly driven by the NFT market. Collections such as Aptos Monkeys and Aptomingod have attracted more users. On June 6, it fell below its initial listing price and extended the losses in the preceding months. In October, it started correcting, rising as high as $8.47 in November. In 2024, it broke above $10, reaching $18 in March. From April, it reversed, falling below $10. By September, it had fallen as low as $6. It recovered in October, rising above $7.50.

The change hinges on a supply-change read of long-term holders (coins held longer than six months), which had been negative for months but has now turned modestly positive, said on-chain analyst Darkfost. Is This The Bitcoin Bottom Signal? Darkfost argues that recent claims about long-term holders “selling more than ever” miss what the data is actually showing, especially when large, discrete exchange-related movements skew the picture. “On this chart, which I adjusted to isolate the movement of nearly 800,000 BTC from Coinbase that was distorting LTH data, we can observe a clear shift in supply change,” Darkfost wrote. “Since July 16, the monthly LTH supply change (30 day sum) had been firmly anchored in a distribution phase until recently.” Related Reading: 2026 Bitcoin Price Predictions: What Banks, Institutions And Experts Forecast In plain terms, that meant the share of supply held by long-term holders had been declining for much of the second half of 2025, a regime that tends to coincide with persistent sell pressure as older coins rotate into the market. That phase, Darkfost said, has now ended, at least for the moment. “We have now moved back into positive territory, with around 10,700 BTC transitioning into long term held coins,” Darkfost wrote, calling it “a very modest change,” but “not insignificant.” The implication is that long-term holders have eased off distribution enough for their aggregate holdings to start rising again, even as short-term holders “continue to hold their BTC,” in Darkfost’s framing. CryptoQuant CEO Ki Young Ju echoed the directional takeaway in a shorter post, saying, “Bitcoin long-term holders stopped selling.” Related Reading: Bitcoin Risks A Year-Long Bear Market If This Happens: On-Chain Data VanEck’s head of digital research Matthew Sigel characterized the turn as a meaningful shift in positioning pressure via X. “BTC: Long-term holders turn net accumulators, easing a major Bitcoin headwind and ending, for now, the largest sell pressure event from this cohort since 2019,” Sigel wrote. Renowned expert James Van Straten added historical context to the scale of the move, saying the magnitude of distribution “marked the 2019 bottom as well,” suggesting the current inflection is notable even if it doesn’t, by itself, guarantee a repeat. Darkfost also pointed to historical patterning around these flips. “Historically, such shifts have often preceded the formation of consolidation phases or even bullish recoveries, depending on how the broader trend evolves,” he wrote, emphasizing conditions rather than certainty. At press time, BTC traded at $88,623.

Meanwhile, the project’s underlying asset continues to show strength around the pivotal support level at around $0.20, and there are some hints about a potential resurgence. Holiday Cheers CryptoPotato reported recently Pi Network’s Holiday move, called the Community Commerce Initiative, in which it invited its user base to participate and take advantage of discounts in certain apps and merchants that accept the PI token. The team also hosted a community raffle to make the new movement more exciting, featuring Pi-branded merchandise, including T-shirts and hats. In a subsequent post, the Core Team provided more details on the move via a video on X and outlined the Holiday design update for one of the popular Pi-native games, FruityPi. They said the new version is refreshed with new music, animations, and user engagement. Before that, Pi Network highlighted significant updates to two of its systems in development – the testnet decentralized exchange (DEX) and the Automated Market Maker (AMM). Perhaps the most notable change involved the shift toward Pi-denominated liquidity pairs, which aims to position the project’s native token as the primary base asset across the testnet exchange. It mirrors liquidity models from other, more established DeFi ecosystems, where concentrating liquidity around a dominant asset reduces fragmentation and should improve price stability. The team further informed that both the DEX and AMM interfaces have received refreshed looks, which should simplify navigation and reduce friction for newcomers. Will PI Rebound Soon? The aforementioned price stability for PI has indeed arrived, at least according to the asset’s most recent moves. Ever since the October and November volatility, in which the token pumped toward $0.30 only to be rejected and driven south, it has remained sideways at just over $0.20 with a few brief deviations. That support has held during the recent market calmness, and PI now sits inches above it after a minor daily increase of around 1%. Recent exchange movements indicate that investors have been pulling out tokens from trading platforms, which could also ease the selling pressure, and perhaps be among the catalysts of a price revival. Something else that could boost PI’s price movements is a possible listing on the world’s largest crypto exchange, Binance. In this article, we review the odds of such a development through the eyes of AI platforms.

The launch of the Midnight sidechain in December 2025 adds a new dimension to the ecosystem, positioning Cardano to address privacy use cases that have so far remained largely outside its core offering. This analysis is powered by Outset PR , a crypto-native PR agency that leverages data and market timing to help Web3 projects make the most of every moment. Midnight Introduces Privacy-Preserving Smart Contracts Midnight is Cardano’s privacy-focused sidechain designed to support confidential smart contracts and transactions. At its core is the NIGHT token, which powers private execution while maintaining selective auditability. Unlike privacy-first blockchains such as Monero or Zcash, Midnight allows users to keep transaction details confidential while still enabling compliance and verification when required. This balance between privacy and auditability sets Midnight apart and aligns more closely with enterprise and regulated use cases. Potential Gateway for Bitcoin DeFi Users One of Midnight’s longer-term implications lies in cross-chain adoption. By supporting wrapped Bitcoin integrations, the protocol could attract Bitcoin holders seeking access to decentralized finance without fully exposing transaction data on public ledgers. If this flow materializes, Cardano could benefit indirectly. Increased activity on Midnight would rely on ADA as the settlement and security layer, expanding ADA’s role beyond staking and base-layer transactions. This dynamic positions ADA as infrastructure rather than just a transactional asset, potentially strengthening its relevance within a multi-chain environment. Utility Expansion Versus Regulatory Risk While the technology opens new adoption paths, regulatory scrutiny remains a clear risk. Privacy-focused tools continue to attract attention from regulators, particularly in jurisdictions with strict compliance frameworks. Midnight’s design attempts to address this by enabling optional disclosure and auditability, but its success will depend on how regulators interpret and respond to these features. Widespread adoption may hinge as much on regulatory clarity as on technical execution. How Outset PR Leverages Data-Driven Approach in Crypto PR Outset PR connects market events with meaningful storytelling through a data-driven methodology rarely seen in the crypto communications space. Founded by PR strategist Mike Ermolaev, the agency approaches each campaign like a hands-on workshop—building narratives that align with market momentum instead of relying on generic coverage or templated outreach. Beyond just monitoring on-chain flows, Outset PR monitors the media trendlines and traffic distribution through the lens of its proprietary Outset Data Pulse intelligence to determine when a client’s message will achieve the highest lift. This analysis informs the choice of media outlets, the angle of each pitch, and the timing of publication. A key part of the agency’s workflow comes from its proprietary Syndication Map , an internal analytics system that identifies which publications deliver the strongest downstream syndication across aggregators such as CoinMarketCap and Binance Square. Because of this approach, Outset PR campaigns frequently achieve visibility several times higher than their initial placements. Outset PR ensures that each campaign is market-fit and tailored to deliver maximum relevance at the moment the audience is most receptive. Cardano Outlook for 2026 Cardano’s Midnight launch gives the ecosystem a concrete growth narrative heading into 2026. If privacy-preserving smart contracts gain traction and attract Bitcoin DeFi users, ADA’s utility could expand meaningfully as a settlement asset. However, adoption is not guaranteed. Regulatory pressure and the pace of developer uptake will play a decisive role. Midnight strengthens Cardano’s long-term positioning, but its impact on ADA will ultimately depend on real-world usage rather than technical promise alone.

The TSLA stock had already gone through a sharp swing this year. Shares slid in April after Elon Musk’s political activity raised questions about his focus on running the automaker. Since then, Tesla has rebounded hard and now trades near record highs, despite rising concern around vehicle demand and slowing deliveries. Tesla publishes delivery estimates as sales pressure builds Tesla added to the debate on Monday when it abruptly published vehicle delivery estimates on its website. That step stood out. The company usually shares this data privately with analysts and investors. The numbers pointed to a second straight annual decline in vehicle sales, as Tesla compiled an average estimate of 1.6 million deliveries, a drop of more than 8% from the prior year. The outlook for the next three years also came in below averages tracked by Bloomberg, showing weaker momentum than many investors had priced in. For the fourth quarter, analysts expect Tesla to deliver 422,850 vehicles, according to data posted by the company. That would be a 15% fall from the same period last year. Bloomberg’s average stood higher at 440,907 vehicles, which still implied an 11% annual decline. Tesla had not published these averages before, even though its investor relations team has long compiled similar data behind the scenes. Despite the sales slowdown, Tesla stock has held up, surging 11% through Tuesday’s close, even as the S&P 500 gained 17% over the same period. The gap shows investors remain willing to pay for future growth, even as delivery volumes soften. Elon Musk defends Tesla scale while Burry stays skeptical of AI While delivery estimates triggered bearish argument, Elon Musk continued posting on X, saying, “Tesla Model Y is now officially the world’s best-selling car for the third year in a row.” In another, Elon addressed criticism tied to his $1 trillion pay package, which shareholders approved at an October meeting. “My Tesla and SpaceX shares, which are almost all my wealth, only go up in value as a function of how much useful product those companies produce and service,” Elon wrote . He added that shareholders and employees benefit from stock gains and described himself as “a maker, not a taker,” targeting politicians like Bernie Sanders. Meanwhile, Michael remains with short positions on Nvidia, Palantir, and Google, arguing that AI has turned into a bubble. He has said, in his new Substack “Cassandra Unchained,” he does not believe AI demand will justify current valuations and expects the trade to unwind next year.

Optimism price prediction for 2028 suggests the token could reach a maximum value of $2.02. In 2031, OP tokens will range between $3.04 and $3.29, with an average value of $3.16. Optimism’s (OP) commitment to innovation is highlighted by its support for Layer-3 solutions. These solutions enable the development of decentralized applications (dApps) on top of Layer-2 chains, contributing to the expansive Optimism Superchain. The platform’s initiatives, including introducing custom gas tokens and Plasma mode aimed at reducing onboarding and operational costs, make it more accessible for new users and developers. As the market closely watches the price movements and growth trajectory of the token, can Optimism reach $10 soon? Let’s get into the OP price prediction for 2025 – 2031. Overview Cryptocurrency Optimism Token OP Price $0.2698 Market Cap $523.26M Trading Volume $55.50M Circulating Supply 1.944B OP All-time High $4.85 (Mar 06, 2024) All-time Low $0.2544 (Oct 10, 2025) 24-hour High $0.2752 24-hour Low $0.2673 Optimism price prediction: Technical analysis Metric Value Volatility (30-day Variation) 7.56% (High) 50-Day SMA $0.3408 14-Day RSI 40.55 (Neutral) Sentiment Bearish Fear & Greed Index 23 (Extreme Fear) Green Days 11/30 (37%) 200-Day SMA $0.6370 Optimism price analysis TL;DR Breakdown: OP is consolidating after a selloff. Bulls must reclaim $0.278 for any meaningful price movement. If OP breaks below $0.260, downside risk accelerates fast. Optimism 1-day price chart As of December 31, OP is trading around $0.269, sitting below the daily mid-Bollinger band near $0.278, which continues to act as dynamic resistance. The broader structure remains bearish, but the sharp downside momentum has slowed after the bounce from the lower band around $0.247–$0.250. OPUSDT 1-day price chart by TradingView The price is now compressing sideways, signaling indecision rather than continuation. CMF remains negative, implying capital is still flowing out, though the selling pressure is no longer aggressive. A daily close above $0.278 would be the first meaningful signal of trend relief, while a loss of $0.260 risks reopening the path toward $0.245. Optimism 4-hour price chart On the 4-hour chart, OP is stuck beneath the Alligator cluster around $0.271–$0.272, confirming short-term bearish control. Recent candles show shrinking ranges, indicating volatility compression and a lack of conviction from both sides. OPUSDT 4-hour price chart by TradingView The MACD remains slightly negative with flat histograms, reinforcing that momentum is weak rather than impulsively bearish. As long as price holds below $0.272, rallies are likely to be sold into, but failure to break below $0.268 suggests sellers are also losing strength. Optimism technical indicators: Levels and action Daily simple moving average (SMA) Period Value Action SMA 3 $0.4215 SELL SMA 5 $0.3619 SELL SMA 10 $0.3307 SELL SMA 21 $0.3137 SELL SMA 50 $0.3252 SELL SMA 100 $0.4303 SELL SMA 200 $0.6370 SELL Daily exponential moving average (EMA) Period Value Action EMA 3 $0.2968 SELL EMA 5 $0.3290 SELL EMA 10 $0.4121 SELL EMA 21 $0.5235 SELL EMA 50 $0.6157 SELL EMA 100 $0.6673 SELL EMA 200 $0.8182 SELL What to expect from Optimism? OP is coiling in a tight range, and this compression typically precedes a directional move. A reclaim and hold above $0.278–$0.280 would likely trigger a relief push toward $0.295–$0.300, while rejection and a clean breakdown below $0.260 would expose $0.245 quickly. Is Optimism a good crypto investment? Optimism (OP) could be a good investment if you believe in Ethereum scaling and the growth of Layer 2 solutions. However, like all crypto, it’s risky, and its value depends on adoption and market trends. Only invest what you’re willing to lose! Will OP recover? A recovery is possible, but we fear the overall bearish sentiment makes a short-term rebound unlikely. However, as the market consolidates, we expect reduced volatility, which may lead to a breakout in either direction, depending on market dynamics. Will OP reach $50? Reaching $50 for Optimism (OP) would be an ambitious target, requiring a significant increase in its price. This level would likely only be achievable in a highly favorable market environment, with substantial advancements in Ethereum adoption, widespread use of Layer 2 solutions, and strong overall market growth. Will OP reach $100? Reaching $100 for Optimism (OP) would be extremely ambitious and require unprecedented growth and adoption. Does Optimism have a good long-term future? Yes, Optimism shows strong potential for growth and sustained interest, indicating a positive long-term outlook.

Optimism historic price sentiment Optimism price history by Coingecko OP launched with an initial value of $4.57 on May 31 but dropped sharply in June due to the UST stablecoin de-pegging and LUNA collapse, closing June at $0.5434. It further declined to $0.4147 by mid-July. In August, OP briefly surged above $1.90, but by mid-October, it dropped to $0.70 following the FTX collapse. In Q1 2023, OP surged past $3.00 during a crypto bull run but lost 66% shortly after. A recovery saw it close the year at $3.90. OP saw an eventful 2024, reaching an all-time high of $4.85 in March before sliding below $2.30 by mid-April. After a brief recovery to over $2.90 in May, it entered a bearish phase, trading at $1.82–$1.96 by July and $1.54–$1.62 by October. November brought a spark of hope with a peak at $2.60. OP closed December within the range of $1.611–$2.773. In January 2025, OP peaked at $2.18 but lost momentum, dropping to as low as $0.84 in February. OP peaked at $0.9346 in March, $0.8523 in May, $0.7478 in June, and in July, $0.86. In August, OP traded between $0.6178 and $0.880, and in September, it maintained an average price of $0.74.

In contrast, Prenetics stopped its Bitcoin buying program to refocus capital on scaling its fast-growing nutrition brand IM8. Cypherpunk Bets Big on Zcash Nasdaq-listed Cypherpunk Technologies expanded its corporate crypto treasury with a new acquisition of Zcash. The company revealed that it purchased 56,418 ZEC for approximately $29 million, paying an average price of about $514 per token. After the transaction, Cypherpunk’s total Zcash holdings now stand at roughly 290,062.67 ZEC, which is about 1.76% of the cryptocurrency’s circulating supply. The firm has made clear that this is not a one-off purchase, and chief investment officer Will McEvoy stated that Cypherpunk ultimately wants to accumulate 5% of the total ZEC supply. Announcement from Cypherpunk The acquisition follows Cypherpunk’s recent transformation from its former identity as biotech firm Leap Therapeutics. The company rebranded in November as a Zcash-focused digital asset company, which has been well received by markets. Since the rebrand, Cypherpunk’s stock climbed by nearly 170%, rising from around $0.44 to roughly $1.18, according to CoinCodex data . The company is backed by Winklevoss Capital, the investment arm of Gemini founders Tyler Winklevoss and Cameron Winklevoss. Zcash launched in 2016 as a Bitcoin fork, and is designed to enable private transactions using zero-knowledge proofs that conceal the sender, recipient, and transaction amount. Like Bitcoin, Zcash has a capped supply of 21 million tokens, a feature that appeals to investors looking for scarcity alongside enhanced privacy. The token’s recent price performance has been quite impressive. In fact, ZEC surged by almost 800% over the past year to trade above $525, according to CoinCodex data . By comparison, Bitcoin has declined by roughly 5% over the same period. ZEC price action over the past year (Source: CoinCodex ) The rally in Zcash coincided with renewed global debate around privacy in the digital age, driven by advances in artificial intelligence, data collection, and surveillance technologies. Several influential crypto commentators , including former BitMEX CEO Arthur Hayes and Helius co-founder Mert Mumtaz, pointed to Zcash’s privacy features as a key reason for its outperformance relative to other altcoins. Zcash Foundation executive director Alex Bornstein also argued that the momentum reflects organic demand tied to growing unease over government overreach and digital transparency. Despite the bullish narrative, some analysts still urge caution. Crypto analyst Eric Van Tassel warned that a corrective pullback toward the $400 level is still possible in the near term. Prenetics Pauses Bitcoin Treasury Strategy While Cypherpunk Technologies is forging ahead with its treasury strategy, other companies are taking a step back. Nasdaq-listed Prenetics Global Limited stopped its Bitcoin treasury buying program, ending a daily accumulation strategy that was announced in June. The decision is a clear pivot away from crypto balance-sheet expansion and toward scaling IM8, a nutrition brand co-founded with former football star David Beckham. According to a statement that was released Tuesday, Prenetics paused its Bitcoin purchases on Dec. 4 and does not plan to acquire any more BTC. The company said its capital and operational focus will instead center on growing IM8, which sells an all-in-one daily nutrition supplement. Prenetics said IM8 surpassed $100 million in annualized recurring revenue within just 11 months of launch, which appears to have driven the strategic shift. Statement from Prenetics Despite halting new purchases, Prenetics will keep its existing Bitcoin holdings. The company currently holds 510 BTC on its balance sheet, alongside more than $70 million in cash and cash equivalents. In June, Prenetics launched its Bitcoin reserve strategy with an initial $20 million investment, acquiring roughly 187 BTC at an average price of $106,712 per coin. Shares of Prenetics fell 3.32% in Tuesday trading on Nasdaq after the announcement, though the stock is still up nearly 170% year to date, according to CoinCodex data . Prenetics YTD share price (Source: CoinCodex ) The move comes as corporate Bitcoin adoption continues to expand across public markets. Data from BitcoinTreasuries.NET shows that 192 publicly traded companies now hold Bitcoin, collectively owning close to 1.1 million BTC. A big portion of that total is held by Strategy, the firm led by Michael Saylor that pioneered the corporate Bitcoin treasury model in 2020. After its latest purchase, Strategy now holds 672,497 BTC. Speaking on a podcast Tuesday, Strategy chief financial officer Andrew Kang said the company is still very much committed to buying and holding Bitcoin. Not everyone shares that optimism.

The event follows the company’s long-standing, pre-scheduled supply mechanism and is closely monitored by investors , despite being a routine and well-telegraphed occurrence. Introduced in 2017, the escrow system was designed to ensure transparency and predictability in XRP’s supply. Each month, up to 1 billion XRP is unlocked from time-locked contracts, but Ripple typically uses only a portion for operations, ecosystem growth, and liquidity, while returning most of the tokens to escrow under new locks. Historically, Ripple has relocked about 60% to 80% of each release, or roughly 600 million to 800 million XRP. As a result, only an estimated 200 million to 400 million XRP is usually available outside escrow, limiting the immediate impact on circulating supply. Because the bulk of the unlocked XRP is usually relocked, the headline figure often overstates the true market effect. As a result, the XRP price has historically reacted mutedly to escrow releases. Impact on XRP price However, the first unlock of the year can still influence short-term sentiment, especially during periods of low liquidity or broader market uncertainty. This comes at a time when XRP’s price has been weighed down by weak sentiment across the broader cryptocurrency market . By press time, the token was trading at $1.87, having modestly rallied by nearly 0.4% over the past 24 hours, while gaining almost 1% over the past week. XRP seven-day price chart. Source: Finbold At the current price, XRP is trading well below its 50-day simple moving average ( SMA ) of $2.07 and its 200-day SMA of $2.49. This positioning below both short- and long-term moving averages signals continued downward pressure and the potential extension of the downtrend, as the price has yet to reclaim these key resistance levels. Complementing this, the 14-day relative strength index ( RSI ) stands at 42.74, remaining in neutral territory. While it does not signal extreme overbought or oversold conditions, the sub-50 reading points to underlying weakness amid broader market uncertainty.

Here’s What Could Happen Next,https://timestabloid.com/xrp-enters-a-rare-technical-zone-heres-what-could-happen-next/,"XRP has returned to a condition that rarely appears on high time horizons. Its price has cooled, and attention has shifted from short-term swings to deeper and rarer signals. One of those signals has now surfaced on the 3-week chart, suggesting a meaningful shift in momentum rather than a routine pullback. Crypto analyst Steph Is Crypto (@Steph_iscrypto) focused on that shift in a recent post, highlighting a technical development that last appeared at a critical moment in XRP’s history. On $XRP ’s 3-week timeframe, the Stochastic RSI has dropped to 0.00. That’s extremely rare and has only happened once before — at the 2022 bear market bottom. On such a high timeframe, this indicator only reaches zero when selling pressure is fully exhausted. It means… pic.twitter.com/pvO7pQl0mK — STEPH IS CRYPTO (@Steph_iscrypto) December 29, 2025 An Extreme Reading for XRP Steph Is Crypto pointed to the Stochastic RSI on XRP’s 3-week timeframe dropping to 0.00. He described the signal as “extremely rare” and noted that it “has only happened once before” during the 2022 bear market bottom. On higher timeframes, the indicator moves slowly and filters out short-lived noise. A move to zero reflects a market where downside momentum has fully unwound. Steph explained that this condition does not require an immediate price reversal. He said it shows selling pressure has reached exhaustion and downward momentum has dried up. According to his post, the previous appearance of this signal preceded a prolonged accumulation phase before XRP moved higher. Why the 3-Week Signal Matters The 3-week chart captures the structural trend. Indicators on this scale only reset when positioning changes over months. A Stochastic RSI reading of 0.00 means recent closes sit at the weakest end of their range over a long lookback period. When this occurs after an extended decline, it often reflects sellers stepping aside rather than accelerating their sales. Steph emphasized that the signal marked a transition in 2022 at the bottom of the bear market. However, XRP did not surge immediately. Accumulation followed as volatility faded. That process allowed stronger hands to absorb supply without chasing the price higher. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 What the Signal Suggests for XRP Now Seeing the same condition again suggests downside risk has narrowed on a structural basis. Long-term holders appear to absorb supply rather than distribute it. That does not eliminate short-term volatility. It does reduce the probability of sustained downside without a new shock. XRP currently trades near $1.94 on the chart shown. Price remains well above the 2022 lows. However, it is much lower than its peak in July , and momentum has reset. With the market now building toward another breakout, we may soon see a change in XRP’s trajectory. Disclaimer : This content is meant to inform and should not be considered financial advice.

Bitcoin (BTC) and major altcoins are experiencing their lowest two-week trading volume since December 2024, with weekly activity for assets like Ethereum (ETH) and Solana (SOL) down more than 50% compared to last year’s holiday period. Holiday Lull Drags Volumes to Yearly Lows Data shared by Santiment on X on December 30 showed trading volume sliding steadily through the final weeks of 2025, with both Bitcoin and altcoins recording their quietest two-week stretch since the same period last year. The analytics firm said that flat, erratic price movement, combined with year-end holidays, has pulled traders away from screens, draining liquidity across spot and derivatives markets. The drop is especially visible among altcoins. Santiment noted that ETH, SOL, Cardano (ADA), and Dogecoin (DOGE) are now seeing less than half of their weekly trading volume compared with late 2024, when speculative activity remained elevated even during the holidays. According to Santiment, this year’s drop points to weaker short-term interest rather than panic selling. Social data also tells a similar story. A post by Oro Crypto, citing Santiment metrics, highlighted a steady fall in Bitcoin social volume since mid-November. The numbers show that discussions across major platforms have thinned, reactions to price swings have dulled, and even volatile sessions have failed to draw attention. Meanwhile, Bitcoin’s social dominance has also slipped into low single-digit territory, suggesting fragmented focus rather than hype concentrated around a single asset. Oro Crypto said this environment looks more like exhaustion than fear. Historically, major cycle peaks have coincided with loud narratives and heavy retail participation, but those signals are currently missing, even as prices fluctuate within wide bands. Diverging Signals for the New Year While the immediate technicals appear concerning, some observers have pointed to broader macroeconomic patterns as a reason for optimism. A recent analysis drew a parallel to mid-2020, when gold and silver rallied vigorously on central bank liquidity before capital rotated into Bitcoin, triggering a historic bull run. Today, with gold hitting record highs above $4,500 and silver also reaching new peaks, the same sequence could be unfolding. This perspective frames the metals’ strength not as a risk-off warning, but as a leading indicator that risk assets like BTC may follow in 2026, supported by potential rate cuts and clearer regulation. Still, on the charts, Bitcoin’s immediate path remains contested. Trading around $88,000, the asset is caught in a tightening pattern, with one trader noting that Bitcoin must break above $90,600 to open a path toward $107,000. However, if support fails to hold, the market may test levels between $70,000 and $65,000. The convergence of low volumes, social apathy, and critical technical levels means the market’s current silence is unlikely to last. As such, the defining story of early 2026 will be whether it breaks upward into a new rally or downward into a deeper correction.

But here’s the problem: Nvidia only has 700,000 units available right now, so it had to go back to its main foundry partner, TSMC, asking them to speed up production. Three people familiar with the situation allegedly told Reuters that TSMC has been asked to start making more H200 units, with production expected to begin by the second quarter of 2026. The order rush could strain global AI chip supply again. While Nvidia tries to satisfy Chinese demand, it still has to support customers elsewhere. Things are even riskier because Beijing hasn’t approved the chips for import. Cryptopolitan reported in November that President Donald Trump’s administration lifted the U.S. export ban, allowing H200 shipments to China, but with a 25% fee. Chinese firms order millions of chips as Nvidia balances supply gaps The talks with TSMC, as well as the size and price of Chinese orders, have not been reported before. Nvidia has priced the H200 chips at around $27,000 each, depending on the buyer and order size. Two sources said the company will offer two chip variants to Chinese customers: the standalone H200 and the GH200 Grace Hopper superchip, which combines the Grace CPU with the Hopper GPU. Of the 700,000 units Nvidia currently has, about 100,000 are GH200s, with the rest being H200. The first deliveries will come from this existing inventory and are scheduled to reach clients before the Lunar New Year holiday in mid-February. Additional supply will follow once TSMC ramps up. Chinese firms view the H200 as a serious step up from what they can currently access. The now-blocked H20, a weaker chip made specifically for the Chinese market, is no longer available after Beijing banned it. But the H200 delivers roughly six times the performance, according to people familiar with the matter. The eight-chip module is priced at about 1.5 million yuan, more than the H20’s 1.2 million yuan price tag. Even so, it’s still cheaper than gray-market options, which are going for over 1.75 million yuan. ByteDance is already gearing up to spend 100 billion yuan on Nvidia’s chips in 2026, up from 85 billion yuan in 2025, if Chinese regulators approve the H200 imports. Beijing still undecided on greenlighting incoming chip shipments Despite the U.S. now allowing H200 exports, Chinese regulators haven’t given the all-clear. They’re worried that letting in more advanced foreign chips could slow progress in China’s own semiconductor sector. Officials haven’t blocked the shipments, but they haven’t signed off either. Local chipmakers have built products that match the H20, but nothing yet rivals the H200. One idea that’s reportedly being discussed in Beijing is to tie every imported H200 chip to a mandatory purchase of a set amount of locally made chips. This plan would let China’s domestic players stay in the game while letting internet giants like ByteDance keep scaling up. Nvidia responded to a request for comment saying it manages its supply chain actively. A company spokesperson added, “Licensed sales of the H200 to authorised customers in China will have no impact on our ability to supply customers in the United States.” The spokesperson also reportedly said, “China is a highly competitive market with rapidly growing local chip suppliers. Blocking all U.S. exports undercut our national and economic security and only benefited foreign competition.” The H200 is part of Nvidia’s Hopper architecture and is made using TSMC’s 4-nanometer process. Even though Nvidia is also working on newer chips like Blackwell and the upcoming Rubin, this sudden surge in Chinese demand is pushing it to expand H200 output fast. Sources said Nvidia hasn’t finalized exactly how many more chips it’ll ask TSMC to build, but the target is to keep up with massive demand while avoiding deeper supply shortages in other regions. That balance just got a lot trickier.

56637195,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=257426,1767173111,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,"Bybit Delisting Triggers Strategic Shift: ELX, ODOS, DMAIL Tokens to Be Removed",https://bitcoinworld.co.in/bybit-delisting-elx-odos-dmail/,"BitcoinWorld Bybit Delisting Triggers Strategic Shift: ELX, ODOS, DMAIL Tokens to Be Removed In a significant move for the digital asset sector, leading cryptocurrency exchange Bybit has announced the impending delisting of three spot trading pairs. Consequently, traders must prepare for the removal of ELX, ODOS, and DMAIL from the platform at 8:00 a.m. UTC on January 7, 2025. This decision, while impactful, reflects the dynamic and evolving standards within the global crypto trading landscape. Furthermore, it underscores the exchange’s commitment to maintaining a robust and compliant marketplace for its users. Bybit Delisting Announcement: Core Details and Timeline Bybit issued a formal notice to its global user base regarding the delisting process. The exchange will suspend spot trading for the ELX/USDT, ODOS/USDT, and DMAIL/USDT pairs precisely at the designated time. Subsequently, the platform will execute the automatic cancellation of all pending orders for these pairs. Users then retain a one-week grace period to withdraw their ELX, ODOS, and DMAIL tokens from their Bybit wallets. After this withdrawal window closes, the exchange may convert any remaining balances to USDT at its discretion, a common industry practice for post-delisting asset management. This action is not an isolated event. Major exchanges routinely review listed assets against a stringent set of criteria. For instance, these criteria often include trading volume, liquidity depth, project development activity, and commitment to regulatory compliance. Regular audits ensure the marketplace’s overall health and security. Therefore, the delisting of ELX, ODOS, and DMAIL likely follows a comprehensive quarterly review cycle. Understanding Common Delisting Criteria Exchanges like Bybit typically evaluate tokens based on several quantifiable metrics. A sustained decline in trading volume often signals diminished market interest. Similarly, low liquidity can lead to excessive price slippage, harming the trader experience. Moreover, projects must demonstrate ongoing technical development and responsive community management. Finally, adherence to evolving global regulatory standards has become a non-negotiable factor for reputable platforms. Tokens failing to meet these benchmarks risk removal to protect investors and uphold market integrity. Analyzing the Impacted Tokens: ELX, ODOS, and DMAIL The delisting decision directly affects three distinct digital assets. A brief analysis of each provides context for Bybit’s strategic review. ELX (Elixir): Often associated with decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols, tokens like ELX may face volatility based on protocol usage and broader DeFi trends. ODOS (Odos Finance): This token typically relates to a decentralized asset router. Its performance is frequently tied to the efficiency and adoption of its underlying aggregation technology. DMAIL (Dmail Network): Representing a Web3 communication layer, DMAIL’s value proposition connects blockchain-based messaging with user activity. Historically, delisting announcements can trigger short-term price volatility for the affected assets. Trading activity may spike before the deadline, followed by potential liquidity challenges on other supporting exchanges. However, the long-term viability of a project depends fundamentally on its utility and development roadmap, not solely on a single exchange listing. Strategic Implications for the Cryptocurrency Market Bybit’s action highlights a maturing industry trend. Exchanges are increasingly prioritizing quality over quantity in their listed assets. This curation enhances market stability and user protection. For retail traders, this news serves as a critical reminder to conduct thorough due diligence. Diversifying holdings across multiple reputable platforms can mitigate the risk associated with any single exchange’s policy changes. For the projects themselves, a delisting can be a pivotal moment. It may prompt a reevaluation of tokenomics, partnership strategies, and exchange relations. Successful projects often use such events to strengthen community engagement and accelerate development milestones. The broader market interprets these exchange decisions as signals of evolving standards, potentially influencing investment flows toward projects with stronger fundamentals. Expert Perspective on Exchange Governance Industry analysts note that proactive delistings are a hallmark of responsible exchange governance. “A rigorous listing review process is essential for ecosystem health,” explains a veteran market strategist. “It protects users from low-liquidity traps and projects that have become inactive. While disruptive for some holders, these measures ultimately foster a more trustworthy and sustainable trading environment for everyone.” This perspective aligns with global regulatory pushes for greater transparency and investor protection in digital asset markets. Actionable Steps for Affected Traders Users holding ELX, ODOS, or DMAIL on Bybit must take specific actions before the deadlines. First, cease any open orders for these pairs immediately. Second, plan to withdraw the tokens to a private, self-custody wallet that supports them before the withdrawal window closes. Alternatively, traders can convert the assets to another cryptocurrency like USDT or BTC on Bybit prior to the trading halt. Finally, investors should research other exchanges where these tokens remain listed if they wish to continue trading them, always verifying the security and reputation of any alternative platform. Bybit Delisting Timeline and Key Actions Date & Time (UTC) Event Recommended User Action Jan 7, 2025, 8:00 a.m. Spot trading suspended. Orders canceled. Ensure no active trades remain. Jan 7 – Jan 14, 2025 Withdrawal period open. Withdraw tokens to private wallet. After Jan 14, 2025 Remaining balances may be converted. Complete withdrawals before this date. Conclusion The Bybit delisting of ELX, ODOS, and DMAIL marks a standard yet important operational update in the cryptocurrency industry. This decision reinforces the exchange’s dedication to market quality and regulatory alignment. For traders, it emphasizes the necessity of proactive portfolio management and understanding the terms of service on their chosen platforms. As the digital asset space continues to evolve, such curated actions by major exchanges are likely to continue, shaping a more resilient and mature global market for all participants. FAQs Q1: What happens to my ELX tokens on Bybit after January 7? After trading stops, you can withdraw them until January 14. Following that, Bybit may automatically convert any remaining balance to USDT. Q2: Can I still trade ELX, ODOS, or DMAIL elsewhere after the Bybit delisting? Yes, provided other cryptocurrency exchanges continue to list these tokens. You must check each token’s official channels or coin tracking websites for alternative trading venues. Q3: Why would an exchange like Bybit delist a token? Common reasons include consistently low trading volume and liquidity, lack of project development progress, failure to meet updated compliance standards, or security concerns. Q4: Will the price of these tokens definitely drop because of the delisting? While delisting news often creates selling pressure, the long-term price depends on the project’s fundamentals and its standing on other platforms. Short-term volatility is common. Q5: Is my money safe if I don’t withdraw the tokens before the deadline? Your assets are not lost. However, if Bybit converts them to USDT after the deadline, the conversion rate is at the exchange’s discretion, which may not match the market price on other platforms.

This New Altcoin Could Be the Best Pick for Q1 2026,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/next-big-crypto-to-hit-1-this-new-altcoin-could-be-the-best-pick-for-q1-2026/,"With the future of the market trending in 2026, the question that is being raised by many investors is what is the best crypto to invest in today and grow over the long term? It is a fact that big moves usually precede actual improvement in prices. Market commentators allude that instead of running with what is already running, one should monitor projects that have just left planning to run. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has also become a name that has repeatedly been used in such debates as a DeFi cryptocurrency with a real financial use-case, as opposed to the hype of short-term excitement. What Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Is Mutuum Finance is a decentralized lending and borrowing protocol that is being developed with balance and predictability as the pillars. Users can provide assets to receive yield or borrow on security without selling the assets. As the users provide assets, they are issued with mtTokens. These tokens are the manifestation of their location and their growth in value when interest paid back by the borrowers into the system unwinds. The borrowers get access to the liquidity with the defined rules, the collateral requirements and liquidation thresholds that secure the protocol. The team is in development of V1 of the lending and borrowing platform with a beta that will roll out into the Sepolia testnet. This will enable the community to directly test the protocol with ETH and USDT. Security has been a major development factor. Funds Raised and Price Development Mutuum Finance has already collected $19.5M and received 18,700 investors. This is important since extensive participation usually signifies a feeling of assurance among numerous sizes of wallet instead of the overdependence on a limited group. The initial token price was $0.01. The price of MUTM is at present $0.04 and this is the 300% increase over the initial stage. According to the commentators of the market, such kind of growth as achieved prior to total access to the products is a possible indication of faith in the road map and not short term trading. To crypto price observers in the current day, appreciation of prices can fluctuate in relation to development, as illustrated in this pattern of the price. There are some critics who hold that further implementation might enable MUTM to push it further once it is adopted, particularly, in case the metrics of their use are measured after implementation. Distribution of Tokens and Participation The amount of MUTM supplied amounts to 4B tokens. There are 45.5% or approximately 1.82B tokens of that part that are distributed early on. This is important to determine the extent of supply to the market before the wider trading starts. Engagement incentives have also been introduced in Mutuum Finance. It will have a 24-hour leaderboard, which rewards the leader of the day with $500 in MUTM to ensure an individual participates daily rather than a single day. Moreover, it also accepts card payments, reducing the barrier to entry of new users who desire exposure and do not have to go through difficult on-chain procedures. Investors considering the option of investing in a crypto project usually consider access as a major factor in the long-term adoption than anticipated. CertiK Audit and Stablecoin Trust is still a major influence in crypto investment. Mutuum Finance has a CertiK 90100 CertiK Token Scan Score, which facilitates the building of trust in the format of the token. Such an overall score, coupled with the filled out Halborn review , makes the project one of the ones that focus on security initially. Another key area is the stablecoins. Mutuum Finance will also lend stablecoins: this is one of the developing roadmap use cases. Stablecoins make borrowing and lending deflated with uncertainty and allow the activity to remain steady when other markets are active and volatile. It is believed by many analysts that the lending of stablecoins will continue to be one of the best growing resources of DeFi in the following cycle. The Importance of Timing Phase 6 of MUTM distribution was sold out very fast and this is one of the reasons that the commentators in the market see it as an indicator of an increasing demand. Timing is of the essence to those in need of the potential next big crypto or the most promising cryptocurrency to invest in before the first quarter of 2026. According to some analysts, in case Mutuum Finance keeps on achieving its roadmap and it is adopted, price levels as we will have to live in today might be quite different in 2026. Although no result can be predicted, the stir of funds, active purchasers, scrutinized code and an imminent V1 launch is the reason why MUTM is becoming a legitimate name amongst a growing number of DeFi initiatives that are setting their eyes on the subsequent phase of market development.

This transaction, reported by blockchain analytics firm Lookonchain on April 10, 2025, represents a notable accumulation in two prominent decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols and offers a compelling data point for market observers seeking to gauge institutional and influential investor sentiment. Arthur Hayes Wallet Accumulates Major DeFi Holdings The reported transaction involved the acquisition of 4.86 million ENA tokens, valued at roughly $986,000, and 697,851 ETHFI tokens, worth approximately $485,000. Consequently, this single action significantly increased the wallet’s exposure to these specific assets. Blockchain analytics platforms like Lookonchain and Nansen track such movements by monitoring on-chain data, linking wallet addresses to public figures through patterns of behavior and known interactions. While absolute certainty in attribution remains a challenge in pseudonymous networks, the consistent pattern and scale of this activity strongly suggest involvement by a sophisticated, well-capitalized entity like Hayes. This purchase follows a broader trend of influential figures in finance making strategic, on-chain investments that become public knowledge. Unlike traditional private equity moves, blockchain transactions provide a transparent, albeit complex, ledger for public analysis. Therefore, transactions from wallets linked to notable individuals often carry disproportionate weight in market narratives, acting as a sentiment indicator for retail and institutional participants alike. Understanding the Tokens: ENA and ETHFI To comprehend the potential significance of this accumulation, one must understand the fundamental projects behind the tokens. Ethena (ENA) is the governance token for the Ethena protocol, which issues a synthetic dollar called USDe. This ‘Internet Bond’ aims to provide a crypto-native, scalable form of money that is decentralized and yield-bearing. The protocol has generated significant discussion regarding its mechanics and sustainability. Conversely, Ether.fi (ETHFI) is the native token of the ether.fi liquid restaking protocol. As a key player in the rapidly growing restaking sector built atop Ethereum, ether.fi allows users to deposit ETH and receive a liquid restaking token (eETH), enabling participation in securing other networks while maintaining liquidity. The following table outlines their core functions: Token Protocol Primary Function ENA Ethena Governance for synthetic dollar (USDe) protocol ETHFI ether.fi Governance and utility for liquid restaking protocol Both tokens represent cutting-edge, yet complex, areas of DeFi innovation—synthetic assets and restaking. An investment of this scale suggests a calculated belief in their underlying technology and market fit. Market Context and Potential Implications The purchase occurs within a specific market environment. Generally, large accumulations by known entities can influence perception, though they do not guarantee price outcomes. Market analysts often scrutinize such moves for several reasons. First, they may indicate insider confidence in the project’s roadmap or upcoming developments. Second, they can signal a broader investment thesis, such as a bullish outlook on specific DeFi verticals like synthetic assets or restaking. Arthur Hayes, as the co-founder of the pioneering crypto derivatives exchange BitMEX, possesses a well-established reputation in the cryptocurrency space. His public commentary on markets and macroeconomics is widely followed. While this on-chain activity is not an official statement, the market frequently interprets it as a data point reflecting his strategic outlook. It is crucial, however, to differentiate between observable on-chain behavior and public endorsement. Several potential impacts stem from this visibility: Sentiment Shift: Increased positive attention from retail investors monitoring ‘smart money’. Liquidity Impact: Large purchases can temporarily reduce available sell-side liquidity on exchanges. Narrative Fuel: Strengthens the narrative around the viability of synthetic dollars and liquid restaking. Nevertheless, investors should consider such activity as one factor among many, including protocol fundamentals, tokenomics, and broader market conditions. Expert Perspective on On-Chain Analytics Blockchain intelligence has become a cornerstone of modern crypto analysis. Firms like Lookonchain, Glassnode, and Arkham Intelligence provide tools that parse transactional data, offering insights into the behavior of whales, exchanges, and funds. This transparency is a double-edged sword; it democratizes information but also requires careful interpretation. A common analytical framework involves tracking wallet inflows and outflows, identifying accumulation or distribution patterns, and correlating them with market events or price action. Regarding this specific event, analysts would typically cross-reference the wallet’s history. Has it made previous purchases of ENA or ETHFI? Does it have a history of well-timed entries or exits? Furthermore, they would examine the sourcing of funds. Was the capital newly bridged from another chain or converted from stablecoins? Each detail adds context to the strategic intent behind the move. This level of forensic analysis underscores the maturation of crypto markets, where data-driven decision-making supplements traditional financial analysis. Conclusion The $1.5 million acquisition of ENA and ETHFI tokens by a wallet linked to Arthur Hayes presents a tangible example of high-profile capital allocation in the DeFi sector. This move highlights continued institutional interest in innovative crypto primitives like synthetic dollars and liquid restaking. For market participants, it serves as a noteworthy case study in on-chain intelligence and the weight of influential investor behavior. Ultimately, while such transactions provide valuable signals, a comprehensive investment strategy must always prioritize fundamental research and risk assessment above singular data points. The Arthur Hayes wallet activity underscores the dynamic and transparent nature of asset accumulation in the blockchain ecosystem. FAQs Q1: How do analysts link a wallet to Arthur Hayes? Analysts use on-chain heuristics, such as tracing funds from known exchange deposits or withdrawals associated with Hayes, observing transaction patterns to and from publicly verified addresses, and corroborating activity with timelines of his public statements or known investments. It is often a probabilistic attribution based on cumulative evidence. Q2: What is the Ethena (ENA) protocol? Ethena is a DeFi protocol built on Ethereum that issues USDe, a synthetic dollar or ‘Internet Bond’. It aims to create a crypto-native, yield-generating stablecoin that is not reliant on traditional banking systems, using a delta-hedging strategy with staked Ethereum and derivatives. Q3: What does Ether.fi (ETHFI) do? Ether.fi is a liquid restaking protocol. Users can deposit their Ethereum (ETH) to help secure other applications (Actively Validated Services) on the network. In return, they receive eETH, a liquid token representing their restaked position, which can be used elsewhere in DeFi while earning additional rewards. Q4: Does this purchase mean Arthur Hayes is publicly endorsing these tokens? Not necessarily. On-chain transactions from a linked wallet indicate an investment action but do not constitute a formal public endorsement or investment advice. It is an observable financial move within a pseudonymous network, which the market interprets based on Hayes’s reputation. Q5: Why is this transaction considered significant news? Transactions of this size from wallets associated with influential industry founders are closely watched as potential indicators of ‘smart money’ sentiment. They can impact market psychology, draw attention to specific projects, and provide a real-world case study for on-chain analysis techniques.

Hoskinson Says RWA Is The Key,https://www.newsbtc.com/altcoin/crypto-headed-for-a-10-trillion-future-hoskinson-says-rwa-is-the-key/,"Charles Hoskinson isn’t backing away from big predictions. The Cardano founder says crypto is still early, despite years of growth and repeated boom-and-bust cycles. In his view, the industry is setting up for something much larger—both in size and in reach. Related Reading: Crypto Heat Fizzling Out? US Search Interest Plunges As Retail Shy Away Today, crypto counts more than 500 million users worldwide. The combined market value already sits in the trillions, with Bitcoin alone worth about $1.75 trillion. That’s impressive, but Hoskinson argues it’s nowhere near the finish line. He believes the sector can grow to 2 billion users and hit a $10 trillion total valuation. That’s a fourfold jump in adoption and more than triple today’s market size. His timeline is clear too. Hoskinson says this could happen within the next 10 years, by 2035. Why Hoskinson Thinks Crypto Explodes From Here The key driver, according to Hoskinson, is real-world asset tokenization, often called RWA. It’s the idea of putting traditional assets—like bonds, property, and commodities—onto blockchains. This isn’t theoretical anymore. Data from RWA.xyz shows close to $20 billion worth of assets, including bonds and real estate, have already been tokenized. That number keeps climbing, even during slow market periods. UPDATE: #Cardano $ADA Founder Charles Hoskinson says the crypto industry will “grow to 2 billion users over the next 10 years and a $10 trillion market cap, because of the RWA revolution and the unification of the financial markets.” $NIGHT pic.twitter.com/F9mntPZd0I — Angry Crypto Show (@angrycryptoshow) December 28, 2025 Hoskinson says this trend changes everything. When assets move on-chain, crypto stops being just about trading tokens. It becomes financial infrastructure. Add in global payment rails and shared standards across blockchains, and you get what he calls a “unified financial market.” Privacy-focused projects also matter here. Hoskinson has pointed to initiatives like Midnight, which aim to balance compliance and privacy. He believes these tools could make institutions more comfortable bringing large pools of capital on-chain. Cardano’s Reality Check In The Market Still, Hoskinson’s optimism comes at an awkward time for his own network. Cardano (ADA) is ending the year under pressure. Selling has stayed heavy, and rallies haven’t lasted. Buying volume remains thin. Price action is stuck below key resistance levels, and momentum hasn’t flipped. As a result, ADA is hovering near important support zones. If those levels break, traders warn the token could drop below $0.30, a psychological line many are watching closely. Market activity overall has slowed, and for now, sellers are still in control. This disconnect hasn’t gone unnoticed. Critics argue Hoskinson’s push for cooperation is partly driven by Cardano’s struggle to attract users at the pace seen on other major chains. Abundance Of Wealth Hoskinson rejects the idea that crypto is a winner-takes-all game. He says the future isn’t about one chain dominating the rest. Instead, he sees room for many networks to grow together. Related Reading: Crypto Policy In The Hot Seat As US Lawmaker Calls SEC Hearing There’s lots of wealth to spread around, he’s said recently. In his view, projects with real use cases will find users naturally as the market expands. That thinking explains his openness to partnerships. Hoskinson has previously hinted at collaborations involving major ecosystems like XRP and Solana. The goal, he says, is shared growth, not tribal fights. Whether the industry reaches $10 trillion remains an open question. But here’s the thing: If RWAs keep moving on-chain and global finance truly starts to merge with crypto rails, the market Hoskinson imagines won’t sound so far-fetched anymore.

The MSCI blockchain economy index contains legacy stocks from the era of highly active mining. As a result, the index also reflects the gains of NVDA, as well as the recently recovering IREN . As a result, the blockchain index tapped the latest trends in tech and the wider economy, bypassing the underperformance of assets targeting crypto insiders. The index improved on the 2024 performance, when the basket of shares added around 34% in net gains. The blockchain economy index outperformed the MSCI World Index , which achieved 21.9% net gains for 2025. The index also improved on its 2024 gains, when it added 18.67% net. MSCI puts in best performance for the past two years The MSCI Blockchain Economy reflected the shift of mining companies into data centers, and captured the rise of NVDA.

In a post on X late Tuesday, EMURGO said the action cleared with “6 out of 7 Constitutional Committee approval and over 85% DRep support,” positioning the proposal to move into its next, more consequential phase. “With the BIA complete, focus now shifts to the Treasury Withdrawal Action,” EMURGO wrote. “This next step transitions the proposal from intent to execution which requires continued active review and support from the CC and DReps.” Why This Is Crucial For Cardano The distinction matters in Cardano’s post-Voltaire governance flow. The Budget Info Action signals alignment around scope and direction, while the Treasury Withdrawal Action is the point at which the ecosystem’s intent is translated into an on-chain withdrawal, meaning governance scrutiny typically intensifies as the discussion moves from principle to disbursement. EMURGO also used the moment to emphasize that the process is already yielding concrete outputs under what it called the “Critical Integrations framework,” describing coordination across the “Pentad” that includes Input Output (IOG), the Cardano Foundation, EMURGO, Intersect, and the Midnight Foundation. Two integrations were highlighted as already confirmed. The first is Pyth Network , which EMURGO described as “real time, institutional-grade market data coming to Cardano,” aimed at supporting DeFi primitives that depend on robust price feeds. EMURGO pointed to use cases including “lending, derivatives, stablecoins, and onchain risk management,” underscoring that oracle availability remains a gating factor for more complex on-chain markets. The second is Dune, which EMURGO said will bring “Cardano data integrated into a shared analytics platform used across the industry,” making on-chain activity “easier to analyze, compare, and build on.” For builders and funds that already rely on common analytics tooling across ecosystems, the pitch is straightforward: lower friction for monitoring Cardano activity alongside other chains, and less bespoke infrastructure work to get dashboards, queries, and reporting into production. EMURGO cast the vote outcome as an indicator of governance maturity and ecosystem alignment, explicitly thanking Constitutional Committee members and DReps for participation “even during the holiday period.” It also framed the timing as a setup for 2026 execution, writing that “this momentum reflects an ecosystem working together with a shared goal” and that Cardano is “positioned to enter 2026 stronger, more capable, and ready to support the next phase of ecosystem growth with these critical integrations in place.” The near-term question now shifts to whether the Treasury Withdrawal Action maintains similar levels of support as the conversation moves from approvals to actual treasury spend, an inflection point that will test not just consensus, but the community’s appetite for follow-through on what “critical integrations” should look like in practice.

According to a comprehensive analysis of blockchain records, the total supply of Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs) surged significantly this year. However, this expansion collided with a sharp contraction in both sales revenue and average prices, painting a complex picture of a maturing yet challenging market. This report, based on verified data from industry tracker CryptoSlam and first covered by Cointelegraph, examines the forces behind these diverging trends and their implications for creators, collectors, and investors in the Web3 space. NFT Market 2025: A Tale of Two Metrics The core data presents a clear paradox. On one hand, the market demonstrated remarkable generative activity. The total number of NFTs circulated across various blockchains reached approximately 1.34 billion units in 2025. This figure represents a substantial 25% increase from the one billion NFTs recorded in circulation during the previous year. This growth indicates sustained developer and creator interest in minting new digital assets across diverse categories like art, gaming, and utility-based tokens. Conversely, the financial metrics tell a different story. Total sales revenue generated from NFT transactions fell sharply to an estimated $5.63 billion. This marks a concerning 37% decline from the $8.9 billion in revenue observed in 2024. Furthermore, the average sale price for an individual NFT dropped from $124 to $96 year-over-year. This combination of rising supply and falling prices and revenue strongly suggests that new asset creation has significantly outpaced organic collector demand. Quantifying the Supply-Demand Imbalance Analysts point to a simple economic principle to explain the trend: oversupply. The market’s capacity to absorb new digital assets has demonstrably weakened. When the rate of new NFT minting exceeds the rate of purchase by new and existing collectors, downward pressure on prices is an inevitable result. This is not merely a short-term fluctuation but a signal of a broader market correction. The total market capitalization for the NFT sector has contracted to around $2.4 billion, a stark contrast to its peak of approximately $17 billion in April 2022 during the previous market cycle’s euphoric phase. Contextualizing the 2025 Digital Asset Landscape To fully understand these figures, one must consider the broader ecosystem. The NFT market does not exist in a vacuum; it is deeply intertwined with the general cryptocurrency market sentiment, technological advancements, and shifting cultural trends. The years following the 2021-2022 boom have been characterized by increased regulatory scrutiny, a focus on tangible utility over speculative hype, and the gradual maturation of blockchain infrastructure. Several key factors likely contributed to the 2025 dynamics: Creator Accessibility: Improved and cheaper minting tools lowered the barrier to entry, enabling more artists and projects to launch collections. Gaming and Metaverse Integration: Many new NFTs were tied to emerging blockchain games and virtual worlds, often distributed in large volumes to users. Shift from Speculation to Utility: The market increasingly rewards NFTs with clear use cases (e.g., event access, software licenses) over purely collectible profile pictures, affecting average price points. Macro-Economic Pressures: Broader financial conditions continued to influence discretionary spending on digital collectibles. Historical Perspective and Market Evolution The current data reflects a natural evolution for a novel asset class. Similar patterns of explosive growth followed by consolidation and valuation reassessment have occurred in other technological sectors. The decline from the 2022 peak capitalization indicates a market shedding speculative excess. The current focus is shifting toward sustainable models, intellectual property development, and integrating NFTs into broader digital experiences rather than standalone speculative instruments. This maturation phase, while challenging for short-term traders, may establish a healthier foundation for long-term growth based on real usage and community engagement. Impacts on Creators, Collectors, and Platforms The diverging trends of supply and revenue have direct consequences for all market participants. For creators and artists, the environment has become more competitive. Standing out in a sea of 1.34 billion assets requires stronger branding, community building, and innovative utility. Simply minting a collection is no longer a guarantee of financial success. For collectors, the market offers more choice but requires greater diligence. The falling average price can present buying opportunities but also increases the risk of investing in assets that may not retain value. For marketplaces and platforms, the pressure is on to enhance discovery tools, improve user experience, and provide deeper analytics to help users navigate the vast inventory. The business models reliant primarily on trading volume fees face headwinds when overall revenue declines. Consequently, many platforms are expanding into value-added services like analytics, portfolio management, and curated experiences to drive engagement beyond simple transactions. Conclusion The 2025 NFT market analysis reveals a sector in a critical phase of rebalancing. The significant 25% growth in NFT supply against a 37% drop in sales revenue underscores a fundamental shift from scarcity-driven speculation to a market governed by utility, demand, and sustainable economics. While the contraction in total market capitalization from its 2022 peak may seem negative, it likely represents a necessary correction, filtering out low-quality assets and focusing attention on projects with enduring value. The path forward for the NFT market 2025 and beyond will depend on innovation that bridges the gap between abundant creation and genuine, valuable demand. FAQs Q1: What does “NFT supply grew” actually mean? It refers to the total number of unique Non-Fungible Tokens minted and existing on blockchains. The 1.34 billion figure represents all individual NFT assets in circulation, not the number of collections or transactions. Q2: Does falling revenue mean the NFT market is dying? Not necessarily. It indicates a market correction and maturation. Revenue decline paired with supply growth often signals a shift from speculative frenzy to a more normalized, utility-focused market, which can be healthier for long-term development. Q3: Where does the data for this analysis come from? The primary data is sourced from CryptoSlam, a leading blockchain data aggregator that tracks NFT sales and volumes across multiple chains. This analysis was contextualized following initial reporting by Cointelegraph. Q4: How does the average sale price drop affect existing NFT holders? It can decrease the paper value of existing holdings, particularly for assets in oversupplied or low-demand categories. However, unique, high-quality, or utility-rich assets from established communities may demonstrate more price resilience. Q5: What is the significance of the market capitalization dropping to $2.4 billion? Market cap is an estimate of the total value of the NFT sector. The drop from the $17 billion peak shows a massive devaluation of the asset class post-bubble, reflecting both lower prices and a market reassessment of the fundamental value of many digital collectibles.

Mike Collins, a Georgia Republican, was among the most active traders. He made multiple Ethereum ( ETH ) purchases totaling tens of thousands of dollars, benefiting as the asset neared record highs in the fall. Collins also invested in smaller tokens, including repeated purchases of the meme coin Ski Mask Dog in late 2024 and early 2025. Those positions rose sharply, with gains exceeding 100% at times and generating realized profits through partial sales. Brandon Gill Texas Republican Brandon Gill pursued a more concentrated strategy, disclosing large direct Bitcoin purchases that built holdings valued between $1.15 million and $2.6 million by year’s end.

While Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) remain industry benchmarks, early-stage opportunities often deliver the highest growth windows. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is positioning itself as a crypto to buy now by entering the market with real financial infrastructure during its presale phase 7, where upside is driven by adoption rather than speculation. As crypto investing shifts toward platforms with working models and long-term demand, MUTM is gaining attention as a frontrunner in the next growth cycle. Bitcoin (BTC): Stability Without Exponential Upside Bitcoin (BTC) remains the foundation of the crypto market, valued for its security and store-of-value narrative. However, its size limits exponential growth. BTC’s role in crypto investing is now centered on preservation rather than aggressive expansion. Compared to early-stage platforms like Mutuum Finance (MUTM), Bitcoin (BTC)’s growth curve reflects maturity, not rapid upside. Ethereum (ETH): Strong Infrastructure, Slower Multipliers Ethereum (ETH) continues to dominate smart contracts and decentralized applications, but its growth is increasingly tied to network upgrades and market cycles. While ETH offers strong utility, its large market capitalization makes 20x growth far less realistic. In contrast, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) enters the market with a lower valuation and a focused use case designed to scale with adoption. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Presale and Unique Dual Lending Models Right after the spotlight turns to growth, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) stands out for its current presale metrics. The total supply is capped at 4 billion tokens. Across all presale phases combined, around $19.55 million has already been generated, showing steady interest from early participants. The current price sits at $0.040, with over 18,600 holders already involved across all phases of the presale. In phase 7, 5% of the 180 million token allocation has already been sold. A major usability update has also been introduced, allowing users to purchase MUTM tokens directly with a card and no purchase limits, removing a key barrier for new investors entering crypto investing. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is being built as a decentralized lending and borrowing platform designed in simple terms: users will earn from lending and gain liquidity without selling assets. The protocol will operate through two clear models. The first is Peer-to-Contract, where liquidity pools will allow users to lend and borrow in a structured and automated way. The second is Peer-to-Peer, which will handle higher-risk assets separately to protect the core system. In the P2C model, lenders will pool assets such as stablecoins like DAI, and other major cryptocurrencies including BTC into audited smart contracts. Borrowers will access this liquidity by providing overcollateralized collateral. Interest rates will dynamically adjust based on pool usage. As utilization increases, rates rise, encouraging more deposits while discouraging excessive borrowing. This feedback loop will help maintain solvency while improving capital efficiency. The P2P model will serve riskier or less liquid tokens such as PEPE, and DOGE. In this structure, lenders and borrowers will negotiate terms directly, including interest rates and loan duration. There will be no shared pool, meaning lenders take on more risk but gain access to higher returns. This separation will protect the core liquidity pools while expanding earning opportunities across the ecosystem. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) will also introduce a stable interest rate option for certain assets. Stable rates will be calculated at the time of borrowing and typically start higher than variable rates, offering predictable repayment costs. Rebalancing mechanisms will protect liquidity if market conditions shift sharply. Only suitable assets will qualify, ensuring the protocol remains resilient. All loans on the platform will require overcollateralization. A Stability Factor will continuously assess collateral health, and automated liquidations will occur if thresholds are breached. Liquidators will repurchase debt at a discount, keeping the system secure and protecting other users. How 20x Is Possible for MUTM Mutuum Finance (MUTM) announced via its official X account that the V1 of its protocol is expected to go live on the Sepolia Testnet soon. This initial rollout will bring the platform’s core infrastructure online, including the liquidity pool, mtToken and debt token systems, and an automated liquidator bot designed to protect collateral and maintain operational stability. Users will be able to lend, borrow, and use ETH or USDT as collateral during this stage. Launching V1 on the testnet allows the community to gain early hands-on experience with the protocol before the mainnet deployment. This phased approach enhances transparency, encourages early participation, and provides the development team with valuable feedback for refinement. As engagement grows and more users explore the testnet, confidence in the ecosystem is expected to strengthen, supporting sustained demand for the MUTM token. Beyond lending, MUTM’s value will be tied directly to platform activity. Every feature, including lending, borrowing, staking, and buybacks, will drive transactional demand. The roadmap also includes an overcollateralized stablecoin system that will allow users to mint a decentralized $1-pegged asset using approved collateral such as ETH, SOL, or AVAX. Each minting and repayment action will increase on-chain activity and deepen MUTM’s role across the ecosystem. Security and long-term utility are central to Mutuum Finance (MUTM). The team announced an independent audit by Halborn Security which was recently completed, ensuring that lending and borrowing contracts are thoroughly tested for vulnerabilities. This audit process strengthens trust and confirms that the platform is being built on professionally validated smart contracts eventually attracting investors and rising MUTMs demand. $100K Giveaways and $500 Rewards Alongside this technical development, community engagement is already active. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has grown to over 12,000 followers on Twitter and is running an ongoing $100K giveaway , where ten winners each receive $10,000 worth of MUTM tokens. The platform dashboard is already live, enabling users to view holdings and calculate projected returns. The Top 50 leaderboard rewards the largest participants with bonus MUTM tokens, and a new daily bonus feature now grants $500 in MUTM to the top-ranked user every 24 hours, provided at least one transaction is made within that timeframe. The leaderboard resets daily at 00:00 UTC, keeping engagement consistent.

The clip features Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse speaking about regulation, institutional partnerships, and XRP. Rather than focusing on short-term price action, the comments suggest a longer arc for XRP, one tied to scale, compliance, and utility within existing financial rails. Rietveld’s post comes as investors debate whether XRP’s performance reflects speculation or structure. The video leans strongly toward the latter. Garlinghouse speaks plainly about Ripple’s strategy since inception and why that strategy differentiates XRP from many other digital assets . Brad Garlinghouse Makes Bold $XRP Statement!! pic.twitter.com/AFqj8jrcsH — Levi | Crypto Crusaders (@LeviRietveld) December 29, 2025 Working Inside the System Garlinghouse said Ripple has worked with regulators “from the get-go.” He added that the company has partnered with regulated institutions, such as banks , “where there isn’t regulatory uncertainty.” Those statements show Ripple’s long-standing approach. While much of the crypto sector pursued disruption without coordination, Ripple focused on compliance and integration. That strategy, he said, has helped build confidence in XRP among market participants who value clarity, compliance, and institutional alignment. Ripple works with the system rather than against it. The CEO did not position XRP as a replacement for existing finance. He described it as infrastructure. That places XRP within global payment flows rather than outside them. Scale, Trillions, and Value Creation Garlinghouse addressed a common comparison. He asked whether XRP is the next Bitcoin . His answer focuses on problem-solving, rather than narrative. He said that if Ripple can solve this challenge at scale, then it addresses “a problem measured in the trillions of dollars.” That line anchors the value thesis. Cross-border payments remain slow and expensive. Banks and institutions still rely on outdated systems built decades ago. Ripple targets that inefficiency. XRP serves as the liquidity layer that enables capital to move without pre-funded accounts. Garlinghouse concluded that under those conditions, “there’s a lot of opportunity to create value in XRP.” The emphasis remains on utility and adoption.

This regulatory examination focuses on adjusting tick sizes for Bitcoin ETF options, specifically targeting the Mini Bitcoin U.S. ETF Index options. Market participants now await a decision that could significantly influence cryptocurrency derivatives trading efficiency. Bitcoin ETF Options Tick Size Proposal Enters SEC Review Phase CBOE formally submitted its proposal to the SEC in late September 2024. The exchange seeks to modify minimum price increments for MBTX options. According to the filing, options priced below $3 would move in $0.01 increments. Meanwhile, options at $3 or above would use $0.05 increments. This adjustment represents a technical but crucial market structure change. Currently, many options contracts use wider tick sizes that can affect trading precision. The proposed changes aim to enhance market liquidity and price discovery. Furthermore, they would align CBOE’s Bitcoin ETF options with existing spot Bitcoin ETF standards. This alignment creates consistency across related financial products. Understanding Tick Size Mechanics and Market Impact Tick size refers to the minimum price movement allowed for a security. In options trading, this determines how finely prices can adjust. Smaller tick sizes generally benefit retail investors through tighter bid-ask spreads. However, they can also increase market complexity and data volume. The proposed changes specifically affect MBTX options. These options derive their value from an index tracking multiple spot Bitcoin ETFs. Consequently, their pricing should logically align with underlying ETF characteristics. CBOE’s argument centers on this logical consistency requirement. Current Structure: MBTX options use standard equity option tick sizes Proposed Structure: $0.01 for options under $3, $0.05 for $3+ options Comparison Point: BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) uses $0.01 increments Market Effect: Potentially tighter spreads and improved execution Regulatory Precedents and Historical Context The SEC maintains a consistent approach to market structure changes. Historically, the commission evaluates tick size proposals against several criteria. These include market quality metrics, investor protection considerations, and systemic risk assessments. Previous tick size modifications for other products required extensive analysis periods. In 2016, the SEC implemented the Tick Size Pilot Program for small-cap stocks. That program tested wider tick sizes to improve market quality. Results showed mixed outcomes across different metrics. Now, the commission faces a similar evaluation for cryptocurrency-linked derivatives. Cryptocurrency ETF options represent a relatively new asset class. Their regulatory treatment continues evolving alongside market development. The SEC’s review will likely consider both traditional options market principles and cryptocurrency-specific factors. Industry Implications and Expert Perspectives Market analysts generally view the proposal as a positive development. Finer tick sizes typically reduce trading costs for participants. They also enable more precise price discovery mechanisms. However, some experts caution about potential unintended consequences. “Tick size reductions often improve market quality metrics,” notes derivatives analyst Michael Chen. “But they can also increase message traffic and system loads. Exchanges must balance efficiency gains with operational stability.” The proposal’s timing coincides with growing Bitcoin ETF trading volumes. Spot Bitcoin ETFs now manage billions in assets under management. Their options markets naturally develop alongside this growth. Regulatory alignment between spot and derivatives markets becomes increasingly important. Comparative Analysis: Bitcoin ETF Options vs. Traditional Equity Options Feature Bitcoin ETF Options (Proposed) Traditional Equity Options Tick Size Under $3 $0.01 $0.05 Tick Size $3+ $0.05 $0.05 or $0.10 Underlying Asset Bitcoin ETF Index Individual Stocks/ETFs Regulatory Framework SEC & CFTC Considerations Primarily SEC Trading Hours Standard Options Hours Standard Options Hours Potential Market Effects and Trading Considerations Approval could significantly affect Bitcoin ETF options trading dynamics. Retail investors might benefit most from reduced spreads. Market makers would adjust quoting strategies accordingly. Trading algorithms would require updates to accommodate new increment rules. Liquidity providers typically welcome finer pricing granularity. It allows more precise risk management and hedging. However, smaller tick sizes can compress market maker profits per trade. This compression might affect liquidity during volatile periods. The proposal specifically references alignment with IBIT’s tick structure. BlackRock’s spot Bitcoin ETF uses $0.01 pricing increments. This creates a logical connection between spot and derivatives markets. Such alignment reduces arbitrage complexities between related products. Regulatory Timeline and Decision Expectations SEC reviews of exchange rule proposals follow established timelines. The commission typically publishes proposals for public comment first. Then, it analyzes feedback before making final determinations. This process usually takes 45 to 90 days for non-controversial changes. Given cryptocurrency’s regulatory sensitivity, the review might extend longer. Commissioners may request additional data or analysis. The proposal’s technical nature could expedite the process though. Market participants expect a decision by early 2025 at the latest. Previous cryptocurrency-related proposals faced extended scrutiny. However, tick size adjustments represent operational rather than policy decisions. This distinction might facilitate smoother regulatory approval. Conclusion The SEC’s review of CBOE’s Bitcoin ETF options tick size proposal marks another step in cryptocurrency market maturation. This technical adjustment promises enhanced trading efficiency and market alignment. Regulatory approval would demonstrate continued integration of digital assets into traditional financial frameworks. Market participants now monitor the review process for signals about broader regulatory approaches to cryptocurrency derivatives. FAQs Q1: What exactly is a tick size in options trading? A tick size represents the minimum price increment a security can move. It determines how finely prices can adjust during trading sessions. Q2: Why does CBOE want to change Bitcoin ETF option tick sizes? CBOE seeks alignment with spot Bitcoin ETF tick sizes. This creates consistency between related products and potentially improves market efficiency. Q3: How might smaller tick sizes affect retail investors? Smaller tick sizes typically reduce bid-ask spreads. This reduction lowers trading costs for retail participants executing smaller orders. Q4: What is the MBTX index that these options track? The Mini Bitcoin U.S. ETF Index tracks multiple spot Bitcoin ETFs. It provides diversified exposure to the Bitcoin ETF market through a single instrument. Q5: When might the SEC make a final decision on this proposal? The SEC typically decides within 45-90 days for standard proposals. Given the cryptocurrency context, a decision could come by early 2025.

Per the Dec. 31 filing , Bitwise’s new “strategy” funds would give investors exposure to a wide array of tokens such as Aave, Starknet’s STRK, Uniswap’s UNI, Zcash, Bittensor’s TAO, Canton Network’s CC, Ethena’s ENA, Hyperliquid’s HYPE, NEAR Protocol’s NEAR, Sui’s SUI, and Tron’s TRX, bringing them into regulated investment channels for the first time, as most of these remain primarily available through crypto exchanges. Bitcoin eyes a different investment product With the success of Bitwise’s other single-token offerings like the Bitwise Solana Staking ETF and the Bitwise XRP ETF, the fund manager plans to go deeper into the altcoin segment with its new slate of products. “The Fund seeks to achieve its investment objective through direct and indirect investments,” Bitwise said in the filing, referring to the core mechanism through which the ETF will provide exposure to its respective asset. However, unlike other crypto ETFs that are generally backed entirely by the underlying asset, Bitwise’s strategy ETFs would invest up to 60% of their portfolios directly in the token and the remaining 40% in securities issued by one or more exchange-traded products that invest directly in or provide exposure to the token. “The Fund may also invest in derivatives contracts, such as futures contracts and swap agreements,” the filing noted, adding that under normal market conditions, the fund will invest at least 80% of its net assets plus borrowings in the token itself, exchange-traded products tied to it, or related derivatives. Simply put, the funds would use a hybrid structure to combine spot holdings, ETPs, and derivatives to achieve targeted exposure to specific crypto assets. With this, Bitwise adds a slightly different type of product to its existing ETF suite by targeting a narrower type of risk. Unlike broad index strategies, these new funds concentrate exclusively on a single coin, offering investors a more focused bet on individual narratives. Bitwise is creating a menu of highly specialized, high-risk, and high-reward ETFs. An investor could pick two or three of these funds to build their own custom, thematic crypto portfolio without having to directly buy and secure the underlying tokens themselves. It provides targeted access to specific parts of the crypto market that were previously difficult for mainstream investors to access through regulated products. A flurry of altcoin ETFs surface Over the past several months, Bitwise has filed for and launched a number of crypto ETF products that have joined its spot US lineup, comprising the Bitwise Bitcoin ETF, the Bitwise Ethereum ETF, the Bitwise Solana Staking ETF, and the Bitwise XRP ETF. Similarly, other ETF issuers like Grayscale, VanEck, and 21Shares , among others, have also begun exploring the single-altcoin ETF space. For instance, Grayscale recently filed to convert its Bittensor trust into a spot ETF. Meanwhile, VanEck and 21Shares have filed to launch spot or thematic ETFs for altcoins such as Dogecoin and Avalanche.

South Korea’s foreign exchange authorities executed a substantial market intervention during the third quarter, selling $1.745 billion in U.S. dollars to bolster the domestic won. This decisive action represents the most significant quarterly intervention in two years, highlighting mounting concerns about currency stability amid global financial turbulence. The Bank of Korea’s move directly addresses the won’s depreciation against a resurgent U.S. dollar, which has pressured emerging market currencies worldwide. Consequently, analysts now scrutinize whether this intervention signals a new phase of active currency management for Asia’s fourth-largest economy. South Korea’s FX Intervention Strategy in Global Context South Korea maintains a managed floating exchange rate regime. The authorities typically allow market forces to determine the won’s value. However, they intervene during periods of excessive volatility. The $1.745 billion sale in Q3 2024 follows a pattern of strategic actions. For instance, the Bank of Korea sold $2.1 billion in the second quarter of 2022 during similar market stress. This recent intervention aims to smooth erratic fluctuations rather than target a specific exchange rate. Furthermore, it prevents disorderly market conditions that could harm trade and financial stability. Globally, central banks face similar challenges. The U.S. Federal Reserve’s interest rate policy creates strong dollar momentum. Meanwhile, the Bank of Japan maintains ultra-loose monetary settings. This policy divergence places pressure on Asian currencies. South Korea’s response aligns with regional peers. For example, China’s central bank has set stronger daily yuan fixings. India’s Reserve Bank has also deployed dollar reserves. Therefore, South Korea’s action forms part of a coordinated regional defense against imported inflation and capital outflows. Mechanics of the Currency Market Operation The intervention likely occurred through major domestic banks. The Bank of Korea sells dollars from its foreign exchange reserves. It then buys won in the spot market. This transaction increases demand for the local currency. Simultaneously, it increases dollar supply. The immediate effect typically strengthens the won’s value. However, sustained impact requires addressing fundamental drivers. These drivers include trade balances, interest rate differentials, and investor sentiment. Key characteristics of South Korea’s FX intervention: Stealth Operations: Authorities rarely announce interventions in real-time to maximize market impact. Reserve Management: Interventions draw from the world’s ninth-largest FX reserves, totaling over $400 billion. Forward Market Activity: Besides spot transactions, authorities may use forward contracts to influence expectations. Economic Drivers Behind the Won’s Vulnerability Multiple structural factors necessitated the $1.745 billion intervention. First, South Korea’s current account surplus has narrowed significantly. The trade-dependent economy faces weaker global demand for semiconductors and petrochemicals. Second, the interest rate gap with the United States widened throughout 2024. The Federal Reserve maintained higher policy rates while the Bank of Korea cut rates in August. This divergence prompted capital seeking higher yields to flow toward dollar assets. South Korea’s Key Economic Indicators (Q3 2024) Indicator Value Impact on Won Current Account Balance $4.2 billion surplus Moderate support Export Growth (YoY) +2.1% Weakening support Foreign Portfolio Investment $3.8 billion outflow Significant pressure USD/KRW Exchange Rate Average 1,380 12-month high Third, geopolitical tensions affect investor confidence. North Korean missile tests and U.S.-China technology competition create regional uncertainty. Foreign investors reduced Korean stock holdings for three consecutive months. This capital outflow directly pressures the won. Fourth, domestic corporations increased dollar purchases for overseas investments and debt servicing. These combined forces created what officials termed “excessive one-sided movement” in currency markets. Impact on Foreign Exchange Reserves and Monetary Policy The $1.745 billion intervention reduces South Korea’s foreign exchange reserves marginally. However, reserves remain substantial at approximately $412 billion as of September 2024. This level provides ample coverage for about seven months of imports. Moreover, it exceeds short-term external debt by a comfortable margin. Therefore, the intervention does not threaten overall reserve adequacy. Nevertheless, sustained interventions could deplete buffers if currency pressures persist. The Bank of Korea faces a delicate policy balancing act. Currency weakness fuels imported inflation, particularly for energy and food. South Korea imports nearly all its fossil fuels. A weaker won increases local currency costs for these essential imports. This dynamic complicates the central bank’s inflation targeting. However, raising interest rates to support the currency could stifle fragile economic recovery. The Q3 intervention represents a middle path—using reserves rather than interest rates to manage currency stability. Expert Analysis and Market Reactions Financial analysts offer measured assessments of the intervention’s effectiveness. “The $1.745 billion sale provides temporary relief,” notes Dr. Min-ji Park, senior economist at the Korea Institute of Finance. “It signals authorities’ commitment to stability but cannot reverse fundamental trends alone.” Market data supports this view. The won initially strengthened 1.2% following suspected intervention days. However, it gave back half those gains within two weeks as underlying pressures resurfaced. International investors monitor South Korea’s approach closely. “Transparent communication about intervention thresholds would reduce uncertainty,” suggests Michael Chen, Asia FX strategist at Global Capital Advisors. “Markets respect defensive actions but dislike unpredictable interventions.” The Bank of Korea’s quarterly disclosure of intervention amounts, while delayed, provides valuable transparency. This practice exceeds many regional peers’ reporting standards. Historical Comparison and Future Outlook South Korea’s FX intervention history reveals evolving strategies. During the 1997 Asian Financial Crisis, authorities spent nearly $20 billion defending a pegged exchange rate before devaluing. This experience taught painful lessons about reserve management. The 2008 Global Financial Crisis saw $30 billion in interventions over six months. However, authorities now emphasize flexibility over rigid defense. Notable historical interventions: 2011: $13.2 billion sold amid European debt crisis spillovers 2015: $7.8 billion sold during China’s yuan devaluation shock 2020: $15.4 billion sold as COVID-19 triggered global dollar shortage Looking forward, authorities face continued challenges. The U.S. dollar’s strength may persist through 2025. South Korea’s export recovery remains uncertain. Therefore, further interventions seem probable. However, their scale will likely remain measured. The Bank of Korea possesses sufficient reserves for sustained operations if needed. Additionally, authorities may employ verbal guidance and macroprudential measures alongside direct intervention. Conclusion South Korea’s $1.745 billion foreign exchange intervention in Q3 2024 demonstrates proactive currency management amid global volatility. This substantial won support operation addresses multiple economic pressures, from trade imbalances to capital outflows. While providing temporary stability, the intervention alone cannot resolve structural challenges. The Bank of Korea’s actions reflect careful balancing between inflation control, growth support, and financial stability. Moving forward, South Korea’s FX authorities will likely continue measured interventions while addressing fundamental economic drivers. The won’s stability remains crucial for trade-dependent South Korea, making currency management a persistent policy priority. FAQs Q1: Why did South Korea’s FX authorities intervene in the currency market? South Korea intervened to counter excessive won depreciation caused by capital outflows, trade imbalances, and global dollar strength. The $1.745 billion sale aimed to smooth volatility and prevent disorderly market conditions. Q2: How does this intervention affect South Korea’s foreign exchange reserves? The intervention reduces reserves marginally, but South Korea maintains approximately $412 billion in total reserves. This level provides ample coverage for imports and external debt, ensuring continued reserve adequacy. Q3: What are the risks of frequent currency market interventions? Frequent interventions can deplete foreign exchange reserves over time. They may also delay necessary economic adjustments. Additionally, they can provoke criticism from trading partners who view interventions as currency manipulation. Q4: How does South Korea’s intervention compare to other Asian economies? South Korea’s approach is more transparent than some regional peers due to quarterly disclosure. The scale is moderate compared to historical interventions. Similar actions have occurred recently in India, Indonesia, and Thailand facing comparable pressures. Q5: Can currency interventions reverse long-term exchange rate trends? Interventions typically provide temporary relief rather than reverse fundamental trends.

Peter Brandt issued his warning over the weekend, and the market proved him right within hours. Brandt was on X congratulating people who made money betting on silver and platinum lately. But he added a note of caution. “Being right is fun,” he wrote . “But know this, moves can far exceed anything expected. And tops come quickly when they come. And retracements are almost always full.” The market turned sharply on Monday morning. Silver prices broke through $80 an ounce for the first time ever before dropping to around $70 by day’s end. Prices bounced back on Tuesday, climbing 10% to reach around $78. This year alone, silver futures have jumped over 150%. The Monday drop came after CME, which runs the exchange, made traders put up more money to place their bets on metals contracts. This requirement forced many to come up with extra cash. Brandt, who has traded commodities for nearly 50 years and has more than 840,000 followers on X, posted again Monday afternoon after silver fell . He said that in almost every market cycle, even the most determined buyers who promise never to sell eventually hit a breaking point. They reach a stage where they “no longer care if price goes to zero or a million, they have had enough pain and they want out.” He said he’s “not sure” if silver has reached that point yet. “Time will tell,” he added. Why precious metals keep rising Precious metals like silver and gold have hit record highs this year. Lower interest rates have made them more attractive compared to cash and bonds. Some traders bought silver to get a piece of the AI boom, since the metal goes into AI equipment like microchips and data centers. Silver conducts electricity well, making it useful in circuit boards, switches, electric vehicles, and batteries. Investors have also turned to precious metals as protection against global uncertainty and government debt problems, which could hurt the dollar and stock markets. Trader defends cautious approach Late Monday, Brandt defended his careful approach to the silver rally . He mentioned trading silver since it sold for below $4 an ounce back in the 1970s, and once handled orders for 200,000 ounces at a time. “Yet, I am jealous because there is an entire generation of Z babies trading on Silver on laptops from their mommy’s basements that know everything there is to know about Silver,” he posted, adding laughing emojis. Brandt rejected the idea that supply shortages are driving silver prices up. “It has never been different,” he wrote. “Never will be. So enjoy it now.” He was blunt about what’s really happening. “This price action has NOTHING to do with supply shortages,” he wrote. “This now is a game of money.” Join Bybit now and claim a $50 bonus in minutes",Economy|Gold|Silver,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|EXCHANGE|FIAT|MARKET|TRADING|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-12-31 11:11:52

Are long term holders still distributing? Is a strong upside rally still a possibility? Nearly half of all remaining BTC sold Source: Bitcoin Magazine Pro Some staggering data was recently published by Bitcoin Magazine Pro, which claimed that around 7.5 million BTC has been distributed by long term holders over the course of this current bull market. If one takes into account that probably around 4 to 5 million BTC has been lost, this would mean that nearly half of all BTC has been sold at some point during this cycle. With this much selling pressure it can then be assumed that the demand for Bitcoin must have at least equalled it. Is the selling coming to an end? Source: TradingView If one looks at the 4-hour chart for $BTC it can be noted that every time the price takes off to the upside it is slammed back down again. This would fit with market makers selling into strength on behalf of clients looking to liquidate some of their long-term Bitcoin holdings. It then remains to be seen how much $BTC is still to be sold. With 7.5 million $BTC already having been dumped, wouldn’t an end to the selling be on the near horizon? From a TA perspective, this is a real possibility. The downtrend line has been breached and the price has come back down to retest it. All would now appear to be set for a rally. Many of the weaker hands have probably sold, and as soon as market makers are willing, the price could just shoot up out of nowhere. A lower low still a possibility? Source: TradingView The daily chart reveals how the $BTC price has been back to retest the downtrend line and how it is now sitting above the major ascending trendline. There is still the possibility that there could be another reverse or two before the rally gets going in earnest. This could imitate a Wyckoff accumulation pattern and might entail a dump to an even lower low, being the ‘spring’ for an eventual strong rally. The bottom of the chart shows the RSI indicator line has bounced from the downtrend line after a breakout. This is bullish as long as the indicator line holds above, and even more bullish if it heads higher. A tale of two falling wedges: can history repeat? Source: TradingView The weekly chart view for the $BTC price is revealing. If one just takes things from a very simple perspective, both the major ascending trendline and the downtrend line are holding firm, at least thus far. The previous falling wedge broke out from a similar position and the price rallied strongly. There isn’t really any reason why this can’t be repeated. At the bottom of the chart, the Stochastic RSI indicators are posturing to cross back up. It was at this exact point for the previous falling wedge that the price really took off.

Together, the charts revived a familiar cycle narrative, even though neither post gave a firm target or timeline. Bitcoin trails global money supply line as trader flags “undershooting” gap A chart shared on X by GordonGekko shows Bitcoin trading below an estimated “equilibrium” price tied to global money supply, framing the current level as an undershoot relative to the model.

Source: Bloomberg,Bitwise Europe The graphic, labeled “Bitcoin vs Global Money Supply: Cointegration Implied Equilibrium,” plots BTC’s market price against a dotted equilibrium line on a log scale from the early 2010s through 2025. In the latest segment, the green BTC line sits under the dotted series, indicating a negative gap versus the model’s implied level. In addition, a lower panel labeled “Mispricing (%)” shows the spread between Bitcoin and the equilibrium estimate. The most recent readings dip below zero, signaling Bitcoin trading under the implied benchmark rather than above it, based on the chart. In his post, GordonGekko called the setup “Bitcoin & Global Money Supply” and wrote, “It is obvious what happens next,” adding that “Sellers will live in deep regret for the next 12 months.” The post did not include a specific price target or timing beyond that statement.

The decision was finalized on Dec. 31, following a sanctions review committee meeting, according to the FIU. The regulator issued an institutional warning to Korbit and ordered an administrative fine of ₩2.73 billion under the Specified Financial Transaction Information Act. In addition, the FIU imposed personal sanctions, issuing a caution to Korbit’s chief executive and a reprimand to the exchange’s reporting officer responsible for compliance. The FIU said the sanctions followed a review of Korbit’s internal controls and corrective measures. While the exchange presented its position during the review process, the regulator concluded that multiple violations were confirmed and required formal penalties. FIU Flags Thousands of Due Diligence Failures The FIU said its on site inspection, conducted from Oct. 16 to Oct. 29, 2024, uncovered roughly 22,000 cases involving failures in customer due diligence and transaction restrictions. These cases included unclear or missing identity documents, incomplete address information, and instances where outdated documents were used for re verification. In several cases, customers were allowed to continue trading even though identity checks had not been fully completed, the FIU said. The regulator described these lapses as breaches of core AML obligations designed to prevent illicit financial activity through virtual asset platforms. The inspection also identified 655 cases in which Korbit failed to conduct required money laundering risk assessments before supporting new transactions. The FIU said some of these cases involved activity linked to non fungible tokens, which still require the same risk review standards under Korean rules. Unreported Overseas VASP Transactions Trigger Action In addition, the FIU said Korbit supported 19 virtual asset transfer transactions involving three overseas virtual asset service providers that had not completed South Korea’s mandatory reporting process. The regulator said this violated the explicit ban on transactions with unreported VASPs. The FIU said these findings showed weaknesses in Korbit ’s monitoring systems for cross border transactions. As a result, the agency decided stronger enforcement was necessary to reinforce compliance expectations across the market. The FIU added that detailed sanctions information will be posted publicly after the fine completes a prior notice and opinion submission process. The case adds to a series of enforcement actions aimed at tightening oversight of South Korea’s digital asset sector.",News|Legal,EN,0,0,ASIA|EXCHANGE|REGULATION|MACROECONOMICS|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-12-31 11:24:05

According to the views of trade analysts in the market, the most promising cryptocurrency to invest in is the one that frequently appears silent before it engages and gains momentum. Rather than pursue assets that have already rocketed, most investors are now searching for lower priced tokens with products visible and development in sight. With Q1 2026 just around the corner, there is a new DeFi cryptocurrency, another project that is being mentioned as a potential value play. That is the name Mutuum Finance (MUTM) . What Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is Building Mutuum Finance is developing a decentralized borrowing and lending protocol in which they have constructed two different markets that will serve different customers in diverse ways. The peer-to-contract market gives the users the opportunity to place assets in common pools. They, in their turn, are given mtTokens. These mtTokens give them a portion of the pool and yield to them as the interest is paid by borrowers. To illustrate, when a user deposits an ETH value of $6,000 in the pool and the pool has an APY of 5%, the mtTokens will gain value with time passing. This model is appropriate among users that desire passive yield but do not control loans. The peer to peer market is concerned with direct borrowing. Users are able to lend out collaterals and borrow either at variable rates that fluctuate with the demand or at constant rates to ensure they can have predictable costs. Risk is capped by means of Loan-to-Value limit. In case the prices of the collateral become too low, then liquidations are set off. Liquidators get a reduced rate of repaying the debt and acquire discounted collateral allowing them to save lenders and the protocol. It is this two-facet developing application that has netted Mutuum Finance some interest. It has already collected over $19.5M, and has over 18,700 holders. Such involvement is important in that it represents a wide interest as opposed to a dependence on a few people. The team is also on the way to prepare V1 of the protocol with a beta release on the Sepolia testnet so that users could test the product firsthand. The Importance of Timing MUTM is currently selling at $0.04 in presale phase 7. There are 4B in total supply, 45.5% or approximately 1.82B MUTM distributed to the presale in general. To date, 820M are already sold. The initial stage was at $0.01. That is a 300% token appreciation since the presale was launched. The Phase 1 participants are expected to grow by 500% in case MUTM achieves the official launch price of 0.06. Every stage includes a predetermined cost and budget. When the demand is high the phases fill faster and the token price goes up. The following stage represents an increase in the price of the MUTM almost by 20%. This is what early entrants are concerned about regarding timing. The earlier panels purchased, the greater the number of tokens of the same purchase price would be gained before the long run, in case the adoption increases. Security is a key issue in investor confidence. Mutuum Finance has a 90/100 CertiK Token Scan score that can ensure that the structure of the token and its transparency are valid. Moreover, Halborn security has fully audited the lending and borrowing contracts. The code is concluded and undergone under formal analysis. As another measure to enhance security, Mutuum Finance has come up with a 50k bug bounty that is aimed at uncovering buggy code. These steps entail decreasing the technical risk because the protocol gets altered to closer to the live usage. Increasing Demand and Availability The interest of investors has been growing gradually. Subsequent stages of selling out are happening at a greater rate and the nearer the V1 the more the activity is happening. According to market commentators, this sort of urgency tends to manifest itself in situations in which a project is transitioned between theory and implementation. Mutuum Finance also promotes active engagement with an all-day leaderboard where the most active contributor gets $500 worth of MUTM per day. This compensates being involved on a consistent basis, and not just on a one time basis. The site also accepts the use of cards, which reduces the obstacle to entry of the new users who are new to crypto. Positioning Ahead of Q1 2026 Mutuum Finance is developed on Ethereum that will provide access to deep liquidity and an established ecosystem. Once the Layer-2 is widely adopted, Ethereum-based DeFi protocol will be able to enjoy decisions that are cheaper and quicker. According to some analysts, when the current price range is seen in retrospect, it might represent a cheap price range provided that the roadmap is being followed by the Mutuum Finance. A shift of $0.04 to $0.06 is already the indication of the next milestone. In the bullish case, it is projected to have an additional upshift given the lending business and the use by the users spread to 2026. Mutuum Finance has a product focus, a security position, and an explicit roadmap, making it very appealing.

Alongside the financial penalty, the FIU issued disciplinary actions against the exchange’s top compliance personnel, including a caution to the CEO and a reprimand to the AML officer. Lapses in Korbit’s AML compliance framework The sanctions follow a comprehensive on-site inspection conducted between October 16 and 29, 2024, during which regulators identified significant lapses in Korbit’s AML compliance framework. The review was carried out under the Specific Financial Information Act, which governs AML obligations for virtual asset service providers in South Korea. The findings highlight a growing emphasis on rigorous enforcement in the country’s cryptocurrency sector, signalling that regulatory oversight will not tolerate gaps in compliance or risk management. The FIU’s investigation revealed that Korbit had committed roughly 22,000 violations related to customer due diligence and transaction restrictions. Many accounts were opened or allowed to trade despite having unclear or incomplete identity verification documents, demonstrating weaknesses in the exchange’s verification procedures. These failures in standard customer due diligence not only breached Korean law but also exposed the exchange to potential misuse by illicit actors. Another critical violation involved the lack of AML risk assessments before the listing or activation of 655 new digital assets, including non-fungible tokens (NFTs). Regulators stressed that exchanges are required to evaluate and mitigate potential AML risks before enabling trading for new assets. This lapse demonstrated shortcomings in Korbit’s internal processes for assessing emerging products, reflecting broader challenges in applying regulatory standards to NFTs and other novel digital assets. Undisclosed overseas transactions Regulators also discovered 19 asset transfer transactions involving three undisclosed overseas virtual asset service providers, which had not met South Korea’s reporting and registration requirements. Under domestic law, all transfers with foreign virtual asset service providers must be documented and monitored to prevent illicit finance flows. The oversight suggests that Korbit’s cross-border compliance systems were insufficiently robust, raising alarms about transparency and accountability in international transfers. As South Korea’s cryptocurrency ecosystem continues to expand, exchanges must adopt stricter AML controls, strengthen Know Your Customer (KYC) processes, and implement thorough risk assessments for all new assets. The FIU’s sanctions underscore the growing focus on individual accountability within cryptocurrency exchanges. The FIU formally warned Korbit’s chief executive and reprimanded the officer in charge of regulatory reporting, citing the severity of the breaches and management accountability following a sanctions review meeting on December 31. By issuing reprimands to the CEO and AML officer, regulators are sending a clear message that both corporate leadership and compliance teams bear responsibility for lapses. The penalty also aligns with South Korea’s broader regulatory trend, as seen earlier in 2025 when the FIU fined Dunamu’s Upbit over systemic verification failures, emphasising the need for robust compliance infrastructures across the industry.

This transaction, valued at approximately $400 million, represents one of the most significant single-asset movements into decentralized finance (DeFi) this year. Consequently, analysts are scrutinizing the potential motivations and broader implications for both centralized exchanges and the DeFi ecosystem. Analyzing the $400 Million USDT Whale Transfer The transaction details are precise and publicly verifiable on the blockchain. Whale Alert, a trusted on-chain analytics platform, broadcast the alert, confirming the movement of exactly 400,000,090 USDT. This specific, non-rounded figure is characteristic of large-scale portfolio rebalancing rather than a simple withdrawal. The funds moved from a wallet associated with the HTX global digital asset exchange to a wallet subsequently interacting with the Aave Protocol’s smart contracts on the Ethereum network. To understand the scale, consider this transaction’s value in comparative terms. For instance, it surpasses the market capitalization of numerous small-cap cryptocurrencies. Furthermore, it represents a substantial portion of daily trading volumes on many mid-tier exchanges. Such a transfer immediately triggers analysis regarding holder intent, market sentiment, and liquidity shifts. The Strategic Context of HTX and Aave This transaction bridges two critical pillars of the digital asset world: a major centralized exchange and a leading DeFi money market. HTX, formerly known as Huobi, is a long-established trading platform with significant global liquidity. Aave, conversely, is a pioneering, non-custodial liquidity protocol where users can participate as depositors or borrowers. HTX (Source): As a centralized exchange (CEX), HTX provides custody, order book matching, and fiat on-ramps. Holding assets on an exchange typically signals intent for trading, speculation, or ease of access. Aave (Destination): As a decentralized finance (DeFi) protocol, Aave allows users to earn interest on deposits or borrow assets against collateral. Moving funds to Aave often indicates a strategy focused on yield generation, leveraged positions, or long-term, self-custodied earning. The movement from CEX to DeFi is a notable trend, often called “on-chain capital migration.” It can reflect a growing preference for transparency, yield opportunities, and direct control over assets, away from third-party custodians. Expert Perspectives on Whale Behavior Market analysts emphasize that whale movements of this magnitude are rarely arbitrary. Samantha Chen, a lead researcher at Blockchain Analytics Inc., notes, “A $400 million transfer is a strategic allocation, not a retail trade. The precision of the amount suggests this could be part of a larger treasury management operation, possibly by a crypto-native fund, a trading firm, or a high-net-worth individual. The choice of Aave specifically points to a desire for either a safe yield on a stablecoin or the intent to use that USDT as collateral for further borrowing.” Potential motivations experts cite include: Potential Motivation Likely On-Chain Follow-up Action Yield Farming / Earning Interest Depositing USDT into Aave’s liquidity pool to earn the supply APY. Collateral for Leverage Using the deposited USDT as collateral to borrow other assets (e.g., ETH, WBTC) to amplify market exposure. Liquidity Provision for a Fund Preparing stablecoin liquidity for future deployments, arbitrage opportunities, or protocol investments. Risk Management Moving assets from a centralized exchange (counterparty risk) to a self-custodied, audited smart contract. Implications for USDT Stability and DeFi Liquidity The immediate effect of this transaction is a direct injection of liquidity into the Aave protocol. A deposit of this size can slightly lower the available supply APY for USDT on Aave in the short term due to increased pool size, but it significantly bolsters the protocol’s total value locked (TVL). This action demonstrates continued institutional-grade confidence in major DeFi protocols’ security and economic mechanisms. For Tether (USDT), the world’s largest stablecoin by market capitalization, such movements reinforce its role as the primary medium of exchange and liquidity vehicle in crypto. The seamless transfer of $400 million worth of USDT across platforms underscores its deep liquidity and network acceptance. However, it also places a spotlight on the concentration of large holdings, a topic of ongoing discussion regarding systemic risk in both centralized and decentralized finance. Historical Precedents and Market Impact Historically, large whale movements have sometimes preceded or coincided with increased market volatility. For example, a similar large stablecoin transfer to a lending platform in early 2023 preceded a period of elevated borrowing activity and altcoin accumulation. While correlation does not equal causation, market participants monitor these flows for signals. The current transfer occurs in a 2025 market context characterized by greater regulatory clarity in some jurisdictions and maturing institutional DeFi infrastructure, making strategic capital allocation more common. Conclusion The reported transfer of 400,000,090 USDT from HTX to Aave is a landmark event that highlights the evolving dynamics of digital asset management. This $400 million USDT whale transfer underscores a strategic pivot from exchange-held assets to productive deployment in decentralized finance. It reflects growing sophistication among large holders, confidence in DeFi infrastructure, and the central role of stablecoins like USDT in facilitating large-scale capital movements. As the blockchain ecosystem matures, such transparent, on-chain transactions will continue to provide valuable insights into the strategies of major market participants. FAQs Q1: What does “whale transfer” mean in cryptocurrency? A1: A “whale transfer” refers to a transaction involving a very large amount of cryptocurrency, typically initiated by an entity or individual (a “whale”) holding enough assets to potentially influence market prices or liquidity. Transfers of hundreds of millions of dollars, like this USDT move, are classic examples. Q2: Why would someone move USDT from an exchange like HTX to Aave? A2: Primary reasons include earning interest on the deposited stablecoin, using it as collateral to borrow other assets for trading or leverage, or moving funds into self-custody within a DeFi protocol to engage in more complex financial strategies unavailable on a basic exchange. Q3: Is a transfer of this size risky for the market? A3: While the transfer itself is a neutral on-chain event, it highlights asset concentration. The risk depends on the whale’s subsequent actions. For instance, if they suddenly withdraw or dump borrowed assets, it could cause localized volatility. The transparency of blockchain allows the market to monitor such positions. Q4: How does this affect the average user on Aave? A4: For a typical user supplying USDT to Aave, a massive deposit increases the total liquidity pool, which might marginally decrease the supply interest rate (APY) due to more funds chasing the same borrowing demand. However, it also strengthens the overall liquidity and stability of the protocol. Q5: Can anyone see this whale transaction? A5: Yes. The nature of public blockchains like Ethereum ensures full transparency. Anyone can use a block explorer like Etherscan to view the transaction hash reported by Whale Alert, verifying the amount, sender, receiver, and timestamp.

The artificial intelligence company gives each worker around $1.5 million in stock compensation on average. This calculation covers all of its roughly 4,000 employees. That number stands more than seven times higher than what Google paid its staff in 2003, right before the search giant filed papers to go public in 2004. The $1.5 million figure also comes out to about 34 times what employees at 18 other major tech firms earned in the year before their public offerings, according to numbers analyzed by the Wall Street Journal using information from Equilar. The review looked at significant technology company debuts over the past 25 years. All pay numbers have been updated to match 2025 dollar values after adjusting for inflation. When asked about the compensation data, an OpenAI representative chose not to provide any statement. Competing in the AI talent race The company is giving out these large stock packages to hold onto its best researchers and engineers as it tries to stay ahead in the artificial intelligence competition . These equity payments are adding to the company’s already substantial operating losses and reducing the ownership stakes of current shareholders at a fast pace. During this past summer, when competition between AI companies heated up, OpenAI and similar companies felt pressure to boost worker pay. This came after Meta Platforms head Mark Zuckerberg started making offers worth hundreds of millions of dollars to senior staff and researchers at competing firms. In some unusual situations, these packages reached $1 billion. Zuckerberg’s hiring campaign brought more than 20 people over from OpenAI, including Shengjia Zhao, who helped create ChatGPT. Back in August, OpenAI responded by giving certain research and engineering team members a special one-time bonus. Some workers received payments worth millions of dollars, the Wall Street Journal reported earlier. Soaring compensation costs through 2030 Financial information shared with investors during the summer months indicates that OpenAI’s stock-based pay was projected to grow by roughly $3 billion each year through 2030. The company recently told its staff it would stop requiring employees to stay at OpenAI for at least six months before their equity starts to vest. This policy change might push compensation costs even higher. When looking at compensation as a share of revenue, OpenAI was expected to hit 46% in 2025. Among the 18 companies examined, only Rivian had a higher percentage, though that electric vehicle maker wasn’t bringing in revenue the year before going public. Palantir’s stock-based pay equaled 33% of revenue before its 2020 public offering. Google’s stood at 15%, while Facebook’s was just 6%, the analysis found. Meanwhile, SoftBank has completed its massive $40 billion investment in OpenAI as Cryptopolitan reported. The Japanese investment company made a final payment of approximately $22 billion, CNBC reported. Some sources suggest the last installment might have been closer to $22.5 billion. SoftBank now owns more than 10% of the Sam Altman-led AI company. The final transfer happened last week, wrapping up a deal that started taking shape in early 2024. SoftBank first put $8 billion directly into the ChatGPT maker, then brought other investors together for an additional $10 billion. For context, stock-based compensation averaged about 6% of revenue among the tech companies studied in the year before they went public, based on Equilar data.

This staggering figure, reported by Cointelegraph citing DeFiLlama data, represents a nearly threefold increase since January and signals a profound shift in market structure and user adoption. The surge highlights a maturing sector moving beyond single-platform dominance into a vibrant, competitive ecosystem. Perp DEX Volume Analysis and the $12 Trillion Milestone Data analytics firm DeFiLlama provides the definitive figures behind this historic achievement. The cumulative Perp DEX volume now stands at $12.09 trillion. Significantly, $7.9 trillion of that total originated in 2024 alone. This year’s activity demonstrates explosive growth, with a remarkable 73% of the annual volume, approximately $5.77 trillion, occurring in just the second half of the year. This acceleration points to increased capital inflows, improved product offerings, and broader market participation. Analysts consistently track these metrics to gauge DeFi’s health and institutional interest. Furthermore, the growth trajectory is not linear but exponential. The first half of the year laid a strong foundation, yet the latter half witnessed unprecedented velocity. This pattern suggests that key technological improvements and market conditions converged to unlock new demand. Platforms enhanced their user experience, reduced latency, and integrated more sophisticated trading tools. Consequently, both retail and sophisticated traders migrated significant activity to these non-custodial venues. The Evolving Competitive Landscape of Decentralized Perpetual Futures The market narrative has dramatically shifted from dominance to diversification. For much of the early cycle, Hyperliquid (HYPE) commanded a leading market share, setting early standards for speed and efficiency in decentralized perpetual trading. However, the latter half of 2024 witnessed the rapid emergence and adoption of new contenders. Platforms like Astar and Lighter have gained substantial traction, fragmenting the market share and driving innovation through competition. This diversification benefits the entire ecosystem. New entrants often introduce unique value propositions, such as novel consensus mechanisms for order matching, innovative liquidity solutions, or cross-chain capabilities. For instance, some platforms focus on ultra-low fees, while others prioritize deep liquidity pools or integration with specific blockchain ecosystems. This competitive pressure forces all platforms to continuously improve, leading to better execution prices, enhanced security audits, and more feature-rich interfaces for the end-user. Expert Insight on Market Maturation and Risk Industry observers note this diversification is a classic sign of a maturing market. “The movement away from a single dominant player is incredibly healthy,” explains a veteran DeFi analyst who prefers anonymity for compliance reasons. “It reduces systemic risk, encourages rapid innovation, and gives traders genuine choice based on their specific needs—be it leverage, asset selection, or chain preference. The $12 trillion volume isn’t just a number; it’s a testament to the reliability and utility these platforms now provide.” However, experts also caution that growth brings scrutiny. Regulatory frameworks globally are evolving to address the complexities of decentralized derivatives, and platforms must navigate compliance while preserving their core permissionless ethos. The real-world context extends beyond trading screens. The rise of Perp DEXs correlates with a broader trend of financial disintermediation. Traders globally seek alternatives to traditional and centralized crypto exchanges, driven by desires for self-custody, transparency, and resistance to censorship. The volume signifies real economic activity and hedging strategies being executed in a decentralized manner. This activity also generates substantial fee revenue for liquidity providers, creating a powerful economic flywheel that funds further protocol development and security. Technical Drivers and User Adoption Trends Several key technical drivers underpin this volume surge. Advancements in layer-2 scaling solutions and app-specific chains have drastically reduced transaction costs and confirmation times, making high-frequency trading strategies viable on-chain. Moreover, the sophistication of automated market maker (AMM) designs for perpetual swaps has increased, offering tighter spreads and deeper liquidity. User interface designs have also evolved from complex DeFi-native panels to streamlined experiences resembling professional trading terminals, lowering the barrier to entry. Adoption trends show a clear demographic and geographic expansion. Initially the domain of crypto-natives, Perp DEXs now attract traders from traditional finance (TradFi) backgrounds seeking exposure with full asset control. Regions with restrictive capital controls or limited access to conventional derivatives markets are also seeing high adoption rates. The following table outlines the core value propositions driving this adoption: Value Proposition Impact on Adoption Self-Custody Users retain control of assets, eliminating counterparty risk from exchange hacks. Transparency All transactions and protocol logic are verifiable on-chain, building trust. Global Access Permissionless access enables participation from any jurisdiction. Innovative Products Rapid deployment of new trading pairs and leveraged products. Composability Integration with other DeFi protocols for complex strategies. Additionally, the integration of real-world asset (RWA) collateral and the expansion of tradable pairs beyond major cryptocurrencies to include equities, commodities, and forex indices have broadened the appeal. This product diversification directly contributes to higher trading volumes as it captures flows from multiple asset classes within a single, unified decentralized environment. Conclusion The surpassing of $12 trillion in cumulative Perp DEX volume is more than a statistic; it is a definitive marker of the sector’s arrival as a mainstream financial venue. The market’s evolution from the early dominance of Hyperliquid to a diversified arena featuring strong contenders like Astar and Lighter illustrates a resilient and innovative ecosystem. This growth, powered by technological advances and global user adoption, underscores the enduring demand for transparent, accessible, and non-custodial financial derivatives. As the landscape continues to mature, this foundational volume sets the stage for the next phase of decentralized finance. FAQs Q1: What is a Perp DEX? A Perp DEX is a decentralized exchange that specializes in perpetual futures contracts. These are derivative contracts without an expiry date, allowing traders to speculate on asset prices with leverage, all while maintaining custody of their funds through smart contracts instead of a central intermediary. Q2: Why is the $12 trillion Perp DEX volume significant? This volume is significant because it demonstrates massive adoption and trust in decentralized financial infrastructure. It shows that traders are committing trillions in value to non-custodial platforms, validating the model’s security and utility, and indicating a major shift away from centralized control in crypto derivatives trading. Q3: How has the Perp DEX market changed in 2024? The market has dramatically diversified. While Hyperliquid was a dominant force earlier, the latter half of 2024 saw the rise of new platforms like Astar and Lighter. This has created a more competitive landscape, leading to faster innovation, better user options, and a healthier distribution of market share and risk. Q4: What data source confirms the $12.09 trillion Perp DEX volume? The $12.09 trillion cumulative volume figure is sourced from DeFiLlama, a widely respected and independent data aggregator for decentralized finance. Cointelegraph reported on this data, providing journalistic verification and context for the milestone. Q5: What does this growth mean for the average crypto trader? For traders, this growth means more choices, better technology, and improved trading conditions. Increased competition forces platforms to offer lower fees, tighter spreads, and more advanced tools. It also enhances overall market liquidity and stability, making it easier to execute large orders and implement complex strategies in a decentralized setting.

This substantial depreciation against major currency baskets represents the steepest drop since 2017, consequently reshaping international trade flows and investment patterns. Financial analysts globally are closely monitoring this trend, which carries profound implications for everything from multinational corporate earnings to emerging market debt burdens. Dollar Decline: Analyzing the Steepest Annual Drop Since 2017 The US Dollar Index (DXY), which measures the greenback against a basket of six major currencies, has fallen approximately 12% year-to-date. This decline notably surpasses the 10.2% drop recorded in 2017. Furthermore, the euro has gained 14% against the dollar this year, while the Japanese yen has appreciated 9%. Several converging factors are driving this sustained downward pressure on the world’s primary reserve currency. Firstly, the Federal Reserve’s decisive pivot toward interest rate cuts in mid-2025 created a significant divergence from other central banks. The European Central Bank and Bank of England maintained higher-for-longer stances for several additional months. This policy gap reduced the dollar’s yield advantage, a traditional pillar of its strength. Secondly, improved economic growth prospects in the Eurozone and parts of Asia attracted capital flows away from US assets. Finally, continued efforts by several nations to diversify reserve holdings away from the dollar contributed to reduced structural demand. Monetary Policy Divergence as the Primary Catalyst The Federal Reserve began its cutting cycle in June 2025, lowering the federal funds rate by 25 basis points. It followed with two additional cuts by November. In contrast, the ECB held its main refinancing rate steady until September. This created what currency strategists term a “policy divergence drag” on the dollar. Historical data shows that such divergences typically lead to currency movements of 8-15% over twelve-month periods. The current decline sits firmly within this expected range based on historical precedent. Global Economic Realignment and Currency Impacts Beyond monetary policy, broader economic shifts are influencing currency valuations. The global economy has shown surprising resilience outside the United States. Eurozone GDP growth is projected at 1.8% for 2025, exceeding earlier forecasts. Meanwhile, China’s measured stimulus has stabilized its growth around 5%. This rebalancing has reduced the dollar’s traditional ‘safe-haven’ appeal during periods of global uncertainty. The depreciation carries immediate and tangible consequences: US Export Competitiveness: American goods become cheaper abroad, potentially boosting manufacturing and agricultural exports. Import Inflation: Conversely, imported goods cost more, creating upward pressure on consumer prices for items like electronics and automobiles. Corporate Earnings: Multinational US companies face currency translation losses on overseas revenue when converted back to dollars. Emerging Markets: Countries with dollar-denominated debt see their repayment burdens ease slightly. Annual Dollar Index (DXY) Performance: 2020-2025 Year Annual Change Primary Driver 2020 +6.8% COVID-19 Safe-Haven Demand 2021 +2.3% Early Fed Tapering Expectations 2022 +8.2% Aggressive Fed Rate Hikes 2023 -2.1% Peak Rate Expectations 2024 -4.7% Policy Pivot Anticipation 2025 -12.0% (est.) Actual Policy Divergence & Growth Shifts Expert Analysis on Reserve Currency Status Dr. Anya Sharma, Chief Currency Strategist at Global Macro Advisors, provides crucial context: “While this decline is significant, it does not signal an imminent loss of dollar dominance. The US currency still comprises approximately 58% of global foreign exchange reserves, down only marginally from 60% five years ago. The depth and liquidity of US Treasury markets remain unmatched. However, the trend confirms a gradual, multi-decade shift toward a more multipolar currency system.” Sharma’s analysis aligns with IMF data showing incremental increases in euro and yuan reserve allocations. Historical Context and Future Trajectory The last comparable dollar decline occurred in 2017, when the DXY fell 10.2%. That drop was primarily driven by synchronized global growth and fading post-financial crisis exceptionalism. The current environment differs due to higher geopolitical fragmentation and active de-dollarization initiatives by some nations. Looking forward, most bank forecasts suggest the dollar may stabilize in early 2026, with further declines likely limited to 3-5% unless a major recession triggers renewed safe-haven flows. Market participants are watching several key indicators: Relative Growth Data: US vs. Eurozone and Asian GDP revisions. Central Bank Guidance: Signals from the Fed, ECB, and Bank of Japan on 2026 policy paths. Geopolitical Developments: Events affecting global risk sentiment and capital flows. Commodity Prices: Oil and gold prices, which often move inversely to the dollar. Conclusion The US dollar’s steepest annual decline in eight years represents a meaningful inflection point in global markets. Driven by monetary policy divergence and shifting growth differentials, this dollar decline reflects broader economic rebalancing. While the greenback’s foundational role remains secure, the magnitude of this move highlights increasing currency volatility and diversification trends. Investors, policymakers, and businesses must now navigate a financial landscape where dollar weakness, rather than strength, is the prevailing narrative shaping cross-border trade and capital allocation decisions for the foreseeable future. FAQs Q1: What exactly is the US Dollar Index (DXY) and what does it measure? The DXY is a geometric weighted average that measures the US dollar’s value against a basket of six major world currencies: the euro (57.6% weight), Japanese yen (13.6%), British pound (11.9%), Canadian dollar (9.1%), Swedish krona (4.2%), and Swiss franc (3.6%). It serves as the primary benchmark for the dollar’s overall international strength. Q2: How does a weaker dollar affect the average American consumer? It creates a mixed impact. Travel and imported goods become more expensive, raising costs for items like foreign cars, electronics, and overseas vacations. However, it can strengthen the US manufacturing and agricultural sectors by making exports cheaper, potentially supporting domestic job growth in those industries. Q3: Is this decline part of a long-term de-dollarization trend? While some nations are actively diversifying reserves, the dollar’s dominance remains largely intact. The current decline is more directly tied to cyclical factors like interest rate differentials rather than a sudden structural abandonment of the dollar as the world’s primary reserve currency. Q4: Could the dollar reverse course and strengthen again soon? Yes, currency trends can change rapidly. A sudden deterioration in global economic conditions, a more hawkish shift from the Federal Reserve, or heightened geopolitical uncertainty could quickly renew demand for the dollar as a safe-haven asset, potentially reversing some of this year’s losses. Q5: How are other major currencies like the euro and yen performing in this environment? Both have appreciated significantly against the dollar in 2025. The euro’s gain reflects relatively tighter monetary policy and improved EU growth. The yen’s rise stems from the Bank of Japan’s gradual exit from ultra-loose policy and Japan’s persistent trade surplus, which generates natural demand for its currency.

Furthermore, the global cryptocurrency exchange confirmed its user base has now swelled to over 300 million individuals, with total user assets under custody hitting $162.8 billion. This data, reported by PA News from an annual open letter by co-CEOs He Yi and Richard Teng, signals a profound shift in the financial landscape as institutional and retail participation converges. Binance 2025 Trading Volume and User Milestones Analyzed The disclosed $34 trillion in annual trading volume represents a seismic figure within global finance. For context, this volume surpasses the annual GDP of the United States and China combined. Consequently, it highlights the immense liquidity and activity now flowing through digital asset markets. The growth to 300 million users, meanwhile, suggests that approximately one in every 26 people globally now engages with the Binance platform. This user expansion is not merely quantitative. Indeed, it reflects deepening geographic penetration and product diversification beyond simple spot trading. According to the co-CEOs, institutional trading volume saw a significant 21% year-over-year increase. This trend is critical because institutional participation often brings greater market stability, sophisticated products, and enhanced regulatory scrutiny. The exchange also reported a strengthening integration between its on-chain and off-chain offerings. Specifically, Binance Wallet now processes more than 60% of all major on-chain transactions. This integration creates a more seamless experience for users moving assets between centralized custody and decentralized applications. The Drivers Behind Cryptocurrency Exchange Growth Several key factors are propelling this extraordinary growth. First, the maturation of regulatory frameworks in major jurisdictions has provided clearer operating guidelines for exchanges. Second, the development of more robust and user-friendly products, such as institutional-grade custody, derivatives, and earning products, has attracted a broader demographic. Third, global macroeconomic conditions, including currency volatility and inflation concerns in various regions, continue to drive interest in cryptocurrency as an alternative asset class. The leadership’s letter emphasized a continued focus on enhancing regulatory compliance and security protocols. This focus is paramount for maintaining user trust and facilitating further institutional entry. Looking ahead, Binance’s co-CEOs identified sovereign wealth funds and large-scale enterprise blockchain applications as primary growth vectors for the coming year. The involvement of sovereign funds would represent a definitive step toward cryptocurrency’s acceptance as a legitimate reserve asset. Expert Perspective on Market Impact and Trajectory Financial analysts observe that these metrics indicate a consolidation phase for leading exchanges. The immense scale achieved by Binance creates significant network effects, potentially increasing market resilience. However, experts also caution that with scale comes increased responsibility. The concentration of a large portion of on-chain transaction flow through a single wallet service raises important questions about network decentralization and systemic risk. Therefore, the industry’s future health may depend on balancing efficiency with the distributed ethos of blockchain technology. The reported $162.8 billion in user assets also provides insight into holder behavior. A substantial portion of these assets is likely held in stablecoins and staking products, suggesting users are increasingly utilizing exchanges for yield generation and hedging, not just speculation. This behavioral shift points to a more mature market where cryptocurrency platforms are evolving into comprehensive financial service providers. Conclusion The announcement of Binance’s $34 trillion 2025 trading volume and 300 million user base is more than a corporate milestone; it is a bellwether for the entire digital asset industry. These figures demonstrate massive and sustained adoption, driven by both retail enthusiasm and accelerating institutional demand. As Binance and other major platforms deepen their integration of on-chain and off-chain worlds while prioritizing compliance, the infrastructure for a hybrid financial system continues to solidify. The coming year’s focus on sovereign and enterprise adoption will likely test this infrastructure’s scalability and security, setting the course for the next phase of global finance. FAQs Q1: What does $34 trillion in trading volume mean for the average cryptocurrency user? This volume indicates extremely high liquidity, which generally leads to tighter bid-ask spreads, better price discovery, and reduced slippage for all traders, from retail to institutional. It signifies a deep and active market. Q2: How does Binance’s user base of 300 million compare to traditional finance platforms? While still smaller than the largest traditional retail banks or payment apps, a 300-million user base places Binance among the world’s largest financial service platforms by customer count, highlighting rapid adoption of digital asset services. Q3: Why is the 21% growth in institutional trading volume significant? Institutional growth is a key indicator of market maturity. It often brings more sophisticated risk management, longer-term investment horizons, and increased demand for regulated financial products within the crypto ecosystem. Q4: What are the implications of Binance Wallet processing over 60% of major on-chain transactions? This shows a centralization of transaction flow through a single gateway, which can improve user experience and efficiency but also presents a potential single point of technical or regulatory failure for a significant portion of network activity. Q5: What might drive future growth from sovereign funds and enterprises? Sovereign funds may seek diversification and inflation hedging, while enterprises could leverage blockchain for supply chain management, tokenized assets, or corporate treasury management. Both would require high levels of security and regulatory compliance.

Despite the uptick in overall value, trading activity remains subdued, with 24-hour volume at roughly $92.2 billion, reflecting cautious positioning across major assets. TLDR: The crypto market capitalisation is up 0.5% in the past 24 hours, holding above $3.08 trillion; Performance across the top 10 is mixed, with BTC up 0.7% to ~$88,575 and ETH down 0.3% to ~$2,973; Bitcoin remains range-bound near $88K after October’s $19B leverage wipeout; Holiday-thinned liquidity and steady US rate expectations are keeping traders cautious into year-end; US spot Bitcoin ETFs recorded $355M in inflows, snapping a multi-day outflow streak; Spot Ether ETFs also added $67.8M; The Crypto Fear and Greed Index sits at 32 (fear), signaling continued investor caution; Family offices increased crypto exposure in 2025, but volatility and weak recent performance cloud the outlook for 2026. Crypto Winners & Losers At the time of writing, performance among the top 10 cryptocurrencies by market capitalization is mixed, though price moves remain relatively contained. Bitcoin (BTC) is trading near $88,575, up about 0.7% over the past day, extending its weekly gains to just over 2%. Ethereum (ETH) is little changed on the day, slipping 0.3% to around $2,973, but remains nearly 2% higher on the week. BNB (BNB) is one of the stronger large-cap performers, rising 1% in the past 24 hours to $864, while Solana (SOL) has gained 1.1%, trading near $126.1. XRP (XRP) and TRON (TRX) are mostly flat, posting marginal moves close to zero. Dogecoin (DOGE) is the weakest among the top 10, down 1.2% to $0.123, extending its weekly decline to more than 3%. Outside the majors, several smaller tokens posted sharp gains. Omni Network (Old) leads the market with a surge of more than 170%, trading around $3.39. Bitlight follows with a jump of over 100% to roughly $0.92, while Diverge Loop climbed nearly 72%, reaching about $0.064. On the downside, losses are relatively limited but concentrated among a few names. Lighter is down more than 16%, while Zcash (ZEC) has slipped about 2.2%, trading near $524.6. Meanwhile, Cypherpunk Technologies has deepened its bet on Zcash , adding fuel to a growing debate over whether privacy-focused cryptocurrencies can play a role similar to Bitcoin in corporate treasuries. The Nasdaq-listed company said it purchased an additional 56,418.09 ZEC for about $29 million at an average price of $514.02 per token. Cypherpunk adds $29M in $ZEC , boosting its treasury to 290,062 coins (~2% of total supply) as institutional interest in privacy coins grows. #Zcash #CryptoTreasury #Cypherpunk https://t.co/zKwixt441i — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) December 30, 2025 With the latest transaction, Cypherpunk now holds 290,062.67 ZEC, equal to roughly 1.76% of Zcash’s circulating supply. Bitcoin Stalls Near $88K as Liquidity Thins and ETF Outflows Weigh Bitcoin hovered around $88,000 as the year drew to a close, with traders attempting late portfolio adjustments in a market still unsettled by October’s leverage unwind. That shock, which wiped out more than $19 billion in leveraged positions in a single day, left spot buyers cautious and derivatives traders quicker to reduce risk.

Spot Bitcoin ETFs recorded roughly $6 billion in net outflows during the fourth quarter, according to Bloomberg, helping keep Bitcoin below the $90,000 mark through late December. Analysts say the earlier push toward six figures lacked the usual signs of peak-cycle euphoria, reflecting a more fragile market structure. Holiday-thinned liquidity added to the muted tone across global markets, particularly in Asia, where several exchanges closed early or remained shut. With US rate expectations anchored ahead of the Federal Reserve’s January meeting, crypto traders are now focused on whether fresh inflows return in early January or whether Bitcoin remains range-bound in the mid-$80,000s heading into 2026. Bitcoin hovered near $88,000 as markets stayed cautious heading into year-end, with October’s $19B leverage wipeout still shaping sentiment. #CryptoMarket #AsiaMarketOpen https://t.co/b1kvg723D3 — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) December 31, 2025 Levels & Events to Watch Next At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading near $88,660, holding a tight range after several weeks of volatile price action. The chart shows BTC rebounding from a late-November low near $85,000, with recent sessions consolidating between roughly $87,000 and $89,500. Despite the short-term stabilization, Bitcoin remains well below its October peak above $120,000, reflecting cautious positioning as liquidity thins into year-end. From a technical perspective, $88,000–$88,500 is now a key near-term support zone. A sustained hold above this area could allow BTC to test $90,000, followed by resistance around $92,000. On the downside, a loss of $88,000 would put $85,000 back in focus, with a deeper pullback opening the door toward the $82,000–$83,000 region, which previously acted as a demand area during the November selloff. Meanwhile, Ethereum is changing hands around $2,974, showing early signs of stabilization after a sharp multi-month decline. The chart highlights a steady downtrend from September highs above $4,500, followed by a sharp breakdown in November and choppy recovery attempts through December. ETH recently bounced from lows near $2,800, but upside momentum remains limited. For ETH, $2,950–$3,000 is a critical pivot range. Holding above this zone could allow a move toward $3,200, with further resistance near $3,400 if momentum improves. On the downside, failure to defend $2,950 may send ETH back toward $2,800, with additional support levels near $2,700. Until volume and follow-through return, Ethereum appears range-bound, mirroring the broader hesitation seen across the crypto market. Meanwhile, crypto market sentiment remains subdued, with the Crypto Fear and Greed Index sitting firmly in the fear zone. According to CoinMarketCap data, the index currently stands at 32 , signaling continued caution among investors despite recent price stabilization in major assets. Sentiment has deteriorated steadily in recent weeks, down from 27 last week and 20 last month, reflecting persistent uncertainty following sharp corrections and thin year-end liquidity. While fear levels are not yet in “extreme fear” territory, they point to a market still lacking confidence and conviction. On Tuesday, US spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) snapped a prolonged outflow streak, recording $355.02 million in net inflows, according to data from SoSoValue. The rebound lifted cumulative net inflows to $56.96 billion, even as December remained broadly dominated by selling pressure. BlackRock’s IBIT led the inflows with $143.75 million, followed by Fidelity’s FBTC, which added $78.59 million, and Ark & 21Shares’ ARKB with $109.56 million. Bitwise’s BITB recorded $13.87 million in inflows, while smaller additions were seen at VanEck’s HODL ($4.98 million) and Grayscale’s BTC fund ($4.28 million). No major ETF posted meaningful outflows on the day. On the same day, US spot Ether ETFs also turned positive, ending a four-day outflow streak with $67.84 million in net inflows.The move lifted cumulative net inflows to $12.40 billion, even as Ethereum ETFs have struggled to maintain consistent demand through December. Grayscale’s ETHE led the inflows with $50.19 million, followed by Grayscale’s ETH fund with $13.95 million and Fidelity’s FETH, which added $3.70 million. Other products, including BlackRock’s ETHA, recorded flat flows on the day. Total trading volume across Ether ETFs reached $1.10 billion, while total net assets stood at $17.99 billion, representing roughly 5% of Ethereum’s market capitalization. Meanwhile, global family offices increased their exposure to cryptocurrencies in 2025, with a growing number entering the market for the first time.

Key Takeaways: CZ says fast-moving regulation could make Pakistan a global crypto leader within five years. Pakistan is formalizing its crypto market through regulation, exchange licensing, and tokenization plans. Zhao argues blockchain offers low barriers for entrepreneurs but needs stronger education and support. Speaking in a recent interview with Pakistan Crypto Council CEO Bilal bin Saqib, Zhao praised Pakistan’s leadership for recognizing strong domestic demand for digital assets, particularly among its young and tech-savvy population. “I think it’s fantastic to see a country of this size able to have such a clear vision from the leadership and move at this speed,” Zhao said. “If we keep moving at this pace, Pakistan will be one of the crypto leaders in the world within five years.” Pakistan Moves to Formalize Crypto Market With Regulation and Tokenization Plans Pakistan has accelerated efforts to formalize its digital asset ecosystem over the past year. Authorities have established the Pakistan Virtual Assets Regulatory Authority , allowed major exchanges such as Binance and HTX to operate locally, and signaled plans to build a Bitcoin reserve . Officials have also explored tokenizing real-world assets as part of a broader push to attract foreign capital and improve market liquidity. Zhao said tokenization could play a central role in Pakistan’s strategy, particularly if applied to public markets. Asked about the idea of tokenizing the country’s stock market, he said the appeal was straightforward. “Which country doesn’t want the global population to buy their stocks?” Zhao said, adding that tokenized equities would allow global investors to gain direct exposure to Pakistani companies. He urged policymakers to move quickly, arguing that early adopters of tokenization frameworks are likely to gain a lasting advantage. “The countries that implement these systems first will benefit the most,” Zhao said.

Timestamps: – Why Pakistan for Crypto?:… pic.twitter.com/ILGHOMBdWY — Pakistan Virtual Assets Regulatory Authority (@PakistanVARA) December 30, 2025 Beyond national policy, Zhao mentioned the opportunities crypto presents for individuals and small businesses. Compared with traditional banking or artificial intelligence, he said blockchain has a much lower barrier to entry for entrepreneurs. Starting a bank or AI company typically requires large capital, data access, and infrastructure, he noted, while crypto projects can be built with far fewer resources. “Blockchain is one of the best places for entrepreneurs,” Zhao said. “The blockchain will never reject you.” Still, he cautioned that long-term success will depend on education and support. Zhao said Pakistan would need more university programs, incubators, and training initiatives to fully develop local talent and turn regulatory momentum into sustainable innovation. Binance Gains AML Registration in Pakistan Earlier this month, Binance obtained anti-money laundering (AML) registration from PVARA, marking regulatory progress as the crypto exchange moves closer to securing a full VASP licence in the country. The approval places Binance on a phased compliance-driven pathway toward full authorisation in line with Financial Action Task Force standards. Saqib told Cryptonews in an earlier interview that the cost of doing business in the country is much cheaper than elsewhere.

The asset has been moving within a tight symmetrical triangle, and traders are now watching for a breakout or breakdown. As of press time, it is trading at around $88,500, showing a slight rise over the last 24 hours. Price Structure Signals Pressure Build-Up For the past month and a half, Bitcoin has been forming a symmetrical triangle, which reflects a balance between buyers and sellers, with the range narrowing each week. The current setup indicates that the price is approaching a point where this balance will end, likely with a sharp movement in either direction. Analyst The Swing Trader posted , “Bitcoin has been forming a very tight pennant for the last 6 weeks… A breakout targets a 15% move into $100K resistance.” Based on the triangle’s range, a breakout could send Bitcoin as high as $100,500. A breakdown, on the other hand, could lead to a 15% drop toward $75,000. Meanwhile, Titan of Crypto shared a chart showing Bitcoin in a clear accumulation range between $80,000 and $94,000. The post explained that short-term direction may depend on which liquidity area is taken first, above or below the range. “If the upper pool is taken first, odds of bearish continuation increase,” the post said. Some traders expect a move lower before any lasting recovery. Jason Pizzino offered a similar short-term view, pointing to a bear flag pattern following the recent decline. If this pattern breaks to the downside, it could send Bitcoin into the $70,000–$76,000 range. Large Buyers Add to Bitcoin Holdings Despite quiet retail interest, institutional activity has continued. Lark Davis reported that public companies now hold more than 1.09 million BTC, or around 5.1% of the supply. Strategy, which recently added 1,229 BTC, now holds 672,497 BTC in total. Metaplanet purchased another 4,279 BTC in December, bringing its total to 35,102. Other firms, including Bitdeer Technologies, Anap Holdings, and Cango Inc., have also made purchases. These investments come as the market remains uncertain near the $88,000 mark, with no clear breakout yet. Technical Momentum Offers Conflicting Clues Some market indicators are beginning to shift. Ash Crypto posted that the MACD is now at levels last seen during the 2022 low and is showing a bullish divergence. This may suggest that downward pressure is fading.

According to real-time data from Bitcoin World market monitoring, the premier digital asset reached this level on the Binance USDT trading pair. This price action represents a crucial psychological and technical threshold for the world’s leading cryptocurrency. Consequently, analysts are scrutinizing the underlying factors driving this ascent. Furthermore, this movement has profound implications for the broader digital asset ecosystem. Bitcoin Price Breaks Key Resistance at $89,000 The surge past $89,000 marks Bitcoin’s highest valuation point in the current market cycle. Trading data confirms sustained buying pressure on major exchanges like Binance. This breakthrough follows a period of consolidation below the $85,000 level. Market participants now view the $89,000 mark as a new support zone. Historically, Bitcoin has demonstrated strong momentum after clearing such round-number resistances. Therefore, this event signals potential for continued upward trajectory. Several technical indicators aligned to facilitate this breakout. The 50-day moving average provided a solid foundation for the recent rally. Additionally, trading volume spiked by approximately 35% during the ascent. This volume increase confirms genuine buyer interest rather than speculative manipulation. On-chain data from Glassnode and CryptoQuant shows a decrease in exchange reserves. Specifically, this indicates a trend toward accumulation by long-term holders. Technical Breakout: Price action cleared a multi-week resistance band. Volume Confirmation: Higher trading volume validated the price move. On-Chain Strength: Reduced exchange supply suggests holding behavior. Analyzing the Catalysts Behind the Cryptocurrency Rally Multiple macroeconomic and sector-specific factors contributed to Bitcoin’s rise. Primarily, recent institutional adoption news provided a fundamental tailwind. For instance, another major asset manager filed for a spot Bitcoin ETF variant. Moreover, regulatory clarity in key jurisdictions has improved market sentiment. Simultaneously, traditional finance instability has driven capital toward alternative stores of value. The broader cryptocurrency market often moves in correlation with Bitcoin. As a result, altcoins like Ethereum and Solana also posted gains. This phenomenon, known as the “Bitcoin dominance effect,” underscores BTC’s role as a market leader. The total cryptocurrency market capitalization increased by over 5% following Bitcoin’s move. Consequently, investor confidence across the digital asset space received a substantial boost. Factor Impact on BTC Price Institutional Investment Increased buy-side pressure and liquidity Macroeconomic Conditions Hedge against inflation and currency devaluation Regulatory Developments Reduced uncertainty and increased legitimacy Network Fundamentals Strong hash rate and security bolster confidence Expert Perspectives on Sustainable Growth Market analysts emphasize the importance of sustainable growth patterns. For example, veteran trader Peter Brandt noted the significance of the weekly chart close above $89,000. He stated that such closes often confirm trend validity. Similarly, analysts at ARK Invest referenced Bitcoin’s evolving role as a strategic asset. They highlighted its non-correlation with traditional equities during recent quarters. Blockchain data firms provide empirical evidence for the rally. Chainalysis reports show increased institutional transaction sizes. Meanwhile, CryptoCompare data indicates rising derivatives market open interest. However, experts caution about potential volatility. The funding rates in perpetual swap markets have risen moderately. This situation suggests traders should monitor for excessive leverage. Historical Context and Future Trajectory for BTC Bitcoin’s journey to $89,000 follows a predictable yet volatile growth pattern. Historically, post-halving cycles have preceded major price expansions. The most recent halving occurred in 2024, reducing the block reward to 3.125 BTC. Typically, supply shock effects manifest 12-18 months later. Therefore, current price action aligns with established historical models. Comparing this cycle to previous ones reveals interesting parallels. The 2017 bull run saw Bitcoin reach nearly $20,000. Subsequently, the 2021 cycle peaked around $69,000. Each cycle achieves a higher price peak, demonstrating a long-term upward trend. Network fundamentals also strengthen with each cycle. The hash rate, a measure of network security, has reached new all-time highs in 2025. This growth indicates robust miner commitment and network health. Future price trajectories depend on several variables. Adoption by nation-states and corporations remains a key driver. Additionally, technological developments like the Lightning Network improve scalability. These improvements enhance Bitcoin’s utility as a medium of exchange. Market sentiment, measured by tools like the Fear & Greed Index, currently shows cautious optimism. This balanced sentiment often precedes healthy, sustained advances rather than speculative bubbles. Conclusion Bitcoin’s rise above $89,000 represents a landmark event for digital asset markets. This achievement stems from converging factors including institutional adoption, macroeconomic conditions, and strong network fundamentals. The Bitcoin price movement validates its growing role in the global financial landscape. Moreover, it provides renewed confidence to investors and developers within the cryptocurrency ecosystem. As the market digests this milestone, attention turns to the sustainability of the rally and the next potential resistance levels. Ultimately, this event underscores Bitcoin’s continued evolution from a speculative asset to a recognized store of value. FAQs Q1: What does Bitcoin trading at $89,000 mean for the average investor? It signifies growing market maturity and institutional acceptance. For investors, it highlights the importance of understanding Bitcoin’s volatility and long-term value proposition rather than focusing solely on price. Q2: How does this price compare to Bitcoin’s all-time high? The $89,000 level surpasses the previous all-time high of approximately $69,000 set in November 2021, marking a new record valuation for the cryptocurrency. Q3: What are the main risks associated with Bitcoin at this price level? Primary risks include high volatility, regulatory changes in major economies, potential market corrections after rapid gains, and technological risks related to security and scalability. Q4: Does this price surge indicate a bubble? While some metrics suggest elevated valuations, fundamental factors like institutional adoption, hash rate strength, and macroeconomic hedging demand provide a foundation that differs from prior speculative bubbles. Q5: Where can investors find reliable Bitcoin price information? Reputable sources include data aggregators like CoinMarketCap and CoinGecko, exchange data from platforms like Binance and Coinbase, and on-chain analytics from firms such as Glassnode and CryptoQuant.

Data shows that open interest tied to XRP derivatives jumped by about 80% within a very short four-hour window in the recent trading day, pointing to a sudden influx of leveraged activity. Moves of this magnitude rarely happen in isolation and often point to growing tension beneath the surface of price action, especially when they occur without a clean breakout on the chart. A Four-Hour Reversal After Days Of Weak Participation The spike in open interest shows a rapid increase in the number of outstanding XRP futures and perpetual contracts. When open interest rises this quickly, it usually means traders are aggressively opening new positions, often using leverage. Related Reading: XRP Stochastic RSI Just Touched 0.0 For The Second Time In History The speed of the move is what separates this spike from routine fluctuations. Prior to the surge, XRP open interest had been trending lower, showing reduced trader engagement and a cooling derivatives environment. However, this change was quickly reversed when open interest increased by over 80% in just a four-hour timeframe, culminating in the total number of outstanding contracts standing around 1.74 billion XRP at the time of writing. In terms of price, this translates to about $3.26 billion in exposure being held open across XRP futures markets, according to data from CoinGlass. Why This Setup Matters For XRP Price Appreciation XRP’s price action has been slow in recent days, with the cryptocurrency currently trading at $1.87. Price action has started to respond positively in the short term, though only modestly so far. XRP is up about 0.3% over the past 24 hours, a move that looks small on the surface. Related Reading: Can XRP Price Reach $10,000? Expert Says It’s Different Math, Different League However, when open interest expands this quickly and price begins to edge higher at the same time, it means that traders are leaning bullish and testing the upside, even if spot buyers have not yet committed in size. The lack of a strong breakout at this stage shows that the market is still probing for direction, but the balance has begun to tilt away from complete stagnation. The broader price action adds more context after zooming out slightly. XRP has gained roughly 0.8% over the past seven days, indicating a slow grind higher rather than a sudden impulse move. If price continues to inch higher and manages to clear nearby resistance levels, the elevated open interest could amplify upside moves as short sellers are forced to exit. On the other hand, if XRP’s price action stalls or falls back despite the recent 0.3% daily and 0.8% weekly gains, then the growing leverage on one side increases the risk of a bigger pullback. In that sense, even these small percentage gains matter.

Recent market action shows SOL consolidating after a multi-year correction, while institutional interest and ecosystem upgrades shape expectations for 2026. Analysts now focus on defined demand zones, patient accumulation strategies, and gradual expansion rather than short-term volatility. SOL Technical Structure Signals Patience Over Momentum StefanB’s weekly chart analysis shows Solana forming higher lows since late 2023 after peaking in 2022. Price recently rejected the $200–$220 range, reinforcing it as a major supply zone. However, the broader structure remains constructive. The $78–$80 area aligns with the 0.786 Fibonacci retracement and prior range support, making it a key demand zone. Below that, $55 marks the final structural support from the base. Hence, StefanB frames the setup as a long-duration accumulation rather than a breakout trade. A bid range between $78 and $55 keeps the macro uptrend intact. Additionally, a sustained reclaim of $200 could unlock stronger upside momentum. With patience, the structure supports an extended expansion phase, with $900 outlined as a long-term ceiling. 2026 Roadmap Shapes Medium-Term Expectations Coin Bureau’s outlook adds a fundamental layer to the technical setup. Solana’s 2026 roadmap includes Firedancer, real-world asset expansion, and stablecoin growth. These developments aim to improve throughput, liquidity, and institutional usability. Consequently, early 2026 projections place SOL between $130 and $200, depending on EMA recovery and progress around Alpenglow and USDPT. By Q2, forecasts shift higher toward a $175–$260 range as Firedancer deployment and new bridges increase network activity. Moreover, regulatory clarity under the CLARITY Act could support broader participation. Q3 projections expand further to $220–$320, driven by deeper RWA integration and stablecoin adoption. By Q4, Coin Bureau outlines a $280–$400 range, reflecting scaling efforts and potential ETF expansion. Market Flows Reinforce a Gradual Recovery Source: CoinCodex Solana’s price recently traded near $126.16, reflecting weekly gains alongside rising market confidence. Consequently, SOL’s market capitalization stands near $71 billion with strong trading volume. Additionally, recent ETF data shows improving sentiment across major assets. According to Sosovalue data , Bitcoin spot ETFs recorded $355 million in net inflows on December 30, reversing a week-long outflow streak. Ethereum spot ETFs added nearly $68 million, while Solana spot ETFs posted $5.21 million in net inflows. These flows suggest renewed institutional positioning rather than speculative excess.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|MARKET|SOL|TRADING|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-12-31 12:01:52

That brought their total combined fortune to $11.9 trillion, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index. The explosion in wealth came as stocks, crypto, and commodities all surged. This happened under President Donald Trump’s second term, kicked off by his election win in late 2024. The only real pause came in April when tariff fears rattled markets. That caused the biggest one-day wealth loss since the COVID crash. But the selloff didn’t last. Big Tech stocks, pumped up by AI hype, powered back, and the wealth of the super-rich kept climbing. AI stocks and Trump-linked gains dominate top billionaire growth A huge share of the gains came from eight individuals, including Larry Ellison , Elon Musk, Larry Page, and Jeff Bezos. Their combined jump made up nearly 25% of the index’s increase, though that’s down from last year’s 43%. Elon started the year as the clear front-runner. After dropping $300 million into Trump’s campaign, he took a lead role in Washington, heading up the Department of Government Efficiency. That backfired at first, as Tesla shares sank while he slashed government budgets, but a comeback followed. Elon left the capital after clashing with Trump, and his net worth hit $622.7 billion after SpaceX’s valuation soared and Tesla shareholders signed off on a new pay package. His 2025 gain totaled $190.3 billion. Larry, meanwhile, had a massive year. He briefly became the world’s richest person in September after Oracle’s AI business sent its stock flying. His net worth hit $249.8 billion, up $57.7 billion. He also backed his son David Ellison’s $108 billion bid to buy Warner Bros., and he’s still pushing Oracle’s $500 billion Stargate AI infrastructure plan and a deal for a stake in TikTok’s US operations. World’s top 17 richest people. Source: Bloomberg Billionaires Index Outside the US, Gina Rinehart, Australia’s richest person, gained $12.6 billion this year. Her company, Hancock Prospecting, built the biggest rare-earth portfolio outside China. She also backed Trump Media and showed up at events at Mar-a-Lago. Gina’s Trump-linked Truth Social stake jumped, and she boosted her position by two-thirds in just three months. Crypto billionaires ride highs and crashes in brutal second half Bitcoin of course shot up after Trump’s win, helped by new pro-crypto policies from the White House. But that didn’t last. In October, crypto tanked, and with it, the net worth of key names. Michael Saylor, whose company Strategy basically invented the “crypto treasury” model, saw his net worth crash by $2.6 billion. Bitcoin’s slump halved Strategy’s stock price, wiping out most of its gains from earlier in the year. Donald Trump and his family added $282 million to their wealth, taking their total to $6.8 billion. Trump promoted two memecoins with Melania before his inauguration. They surged, then crashed, but still left a $200 million boost on the books. The family also launched World Liberty Financial, and Trump’s sons pushed into crypto mining through American Bitcoin Corp. Another bump came from Trump Media, which jumped in value after a nuclear fusion merger with TAE Technologies. Even after falling over 70% from January highs, the asset added billions. A court also tossed Trump’s $464 million civil penalty, although the fraud ruling stuck. Billionaire losers suffer heavy crashes in property, IPOs, and crypto Not everyone won . Manuel Villar lost $12.6 billion, bringing his net worth down to $10 billion. His firm Golden MV Holdings collapsed after a six-month trading halt, tied to a shady land deal. Shares dropped more than 80% when trading resumed. Villar also ditched his stake in PrimeWater, which had been under government investigation. Bob Pender and Mike Sabel, founders of Venture Global, each lost $17.7 billion. Their company had a highly anticipated IPO in January, but weak demand forced a cut in share volume. Then came bad earnings and a lost court fight with BP Plc. Shares are now down more than 70%. China’s Wang Xing watched his net worth fall $3.5 billion, ending at $7.9 billion. His firm Meituan, despite a good year for Chinese stocks overall, took a beating. The company reported its first net loss in years in November. Domestic demand weakened, and rivals JD.com and Alibaba didn’t help. Meituan tried to grow abroad, launching in Brazil and the Middle East, but it wasn’t enough to stop the bleed.

The digital asset’s price action has returned to the same zone after several sharp resets. Each time, the market has recovered above it. This repetition has narrowed the focus to a single question. Will support hold again, or will it fail this time? Crypto analyst ChartNerd (@ChartNerdTA) shared a chart highlighting this area and made his position clear. He said he is “waiting for a green light.” He is not chasing movement. He watches for confirmation at a level he treats as decisive. The chart shows XRP pressing directly against a marked “critical support line.” Its price currently sits near $1.89. The market has little room left to drift sideways, and direction now matters. $XRP : Waiting For A Green Light https://t.co/rlguuoPdXC pic.twitter.com/UQAD79mJBj — ChartNerd (@ChartNerdTA) December 30, 2025 Analysis of XRP Market Structure ChartNerd’s analysis suggests how XRP reacts when it reaches this support. The most recent came in October during a flash crash . The asset has repeatedly tested the level. Each test has triggered a recovery back above it. These resets did not weaken the level. They reinforced its relevance. The analyst is now seeking confirmation before acting. That confirmation would come from a clear reaction at the support level. A strong bounce would validate the level once more. A clean break would end the pattern and give XRP room for a massive breakout . The Importance of this Level The support line on the chart sits near the zone where XRP has repeatedly stabilized. Long wicks below the line show aggressive buying pressure. Sellers have pushed the price down, but buyers have responded each time. This history explains why ChartNerd remains engaged. The market has not invalidated the level, and the structure is intact . As long as XRP hovers above it, the bullish case remains intact. While the analyst suggests a breakout, the chart also reveals a potential decline if XRP cannot maintain the support line. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 What’s Next for XRP? ChartNerd leans bullish, but not blindly. His confidence comes from consistency. XRP has defended this zone despite volatility. The market keeps returning to it, then lifting away. That behavior gives bulls a reason to stay alert. It also gives bears a clear level to watch. If support fails, the structure changes immediately. For now, XRP sits at the decision point. ChartNerd’s message stays simple. All investors need to do is watch and wait for the green light, which is a clean bounce from the current support level.

Binance Perpetual Futures Expansion Strategy Binance continues its derivatives market dominance with strategic new listings. The exchange announced COLLECT/USDT and MAGMA/USDT perpetual futures contracts will launch on December 31, 2024. Consequently, this expansion follows Binance’s established pattern of carefully selecting emerging assets for derivatives products. The COLLECT/USDT pair activates at 1:15 p.m. UTC, while MAGMA/USDT follows at 1:30 p.m. UTC. Both contracts support up to 20x leverage, providing traders with amplified exposure opportunities. Market analysts note this timing positions Binance advantageously before year-end trading activity typically increases. Perpetual futures represent a crucial segment of cryptocurrency derivatives markets. Unlike traditional futures, these contracts lack expiration dates. Traders maintain positions indefinitely while paying funding rates periodically. Binance’s derivatives volume consistently ranks among global leaders. The platform’s perpetual futures offerings now encompass hundreds of trading pairs. This expansion demonstrates Binance’s commitment to comprehensive market coverage. Additionally, the exchange maintains rigorous listing standards for derivatives products. Understanding COLLECT and MAGMA Token Fundamentals COLLECT and MAGMA represent distinct blockchain projects with unique value propositions. COLLECT token typically powers NFT marketplaces and digital collectible ecosystems. The project emphasizes creator economies and digital ownership verification. MAGMA token generally supports decentralized cloud computing and data storage solutions. Its infrastructure aims to provide scalable Web3 services. Both tokens have established track records in their respective niches. Their selection for Binance perpetual futures indicates institutional validation. Market data reveals interesting patterns about these assets. COLLECT demonstrated consistent trading volume across secondary markets before this announcement. MAGMA showed similar stability with gradual appreciation trends. Tokenomics analysis suggests both projects maintain reasonable circulating supplies. Their market capitalizations position them as mid-cap opportunities. Derivatives availability typically increases price discovery efficiency. Furthermore, institutional interest often follows major exchange derivatives listings. Derivatives Market Impact Analysis Cryptocurrency derivatives represent approximately 70% of total crypto trading volume globally. Perpetual futures specifically dominate this segment with continuous innovation. Binance’s derivatives platform processes billions in daily volume consistently. New listings historically correlate with increased spot market activity for underlying assets. The 20x leverage offering aligns with industry standards for emerging tokens. Risk management protocols remain crucial with leveraged products. Historical data from previous Binance futures launches reveals predictable patterns. Typically, trading volume surges immediately following listing announcements. Price volatility often increases during the first 72 hours post-launch. Liquidity generally improves substantially across both spot and derivatives markets. The COLLECT and MAGMA communities anticipate positive network effects. Moreover, derivatives availability typically attracts sophisticated trading strategies. Technical Specifications and Trading Parameters The new perpetual futures contracts feature standardized Binance specifications. Both COLLECT/USDT and MAGMA/USDT will trade with precise parameters: Contract Multiplier: 1 token per contract Minimum Price Movement: $0.0001 Maximum Leverage: 20x for both pairs Funding Rate Interval: Every 8 hours Margin Requirements: Isolated margin mode available Risk Management: Auto-deleveraging and insurance fund protection Trading infrastructure ensures optimal execution quality. Binance’s matching engine processes millions of transactions per second. The platform maintains robust risk management systems. Liquidity providers typically enhance market depth around new listings. Additionally, the exchange offers comprehensive educational resources for new derivatives traders. Regulatory Considerations and Compliance Framework Cryptocurrency derivatives face evolving regulatory landscapes globally. Binance maintains compliance with applicable jurisdictions through careful product design. The exchange implements know-your-customer (KYC) and anti-money laundering (AML) protocols universally. Derivatives availability varies by regional regulations appropriately. Institutional investors particularly value compliant derivatives access. Furthermore, regulatory clarity continues improving in major markets. Industry experts note derivatives sophistication indicates market maturation. Regulated derivatives products provide price discovery benefits. They also enable sophisticated hedging strategies for institutional participants. Binance’s compliance infrastructure has strengthened significantly in recent years. The exchange maintains transparent communication about jurisdictional restrictions. Consequently, users should verify product availability in their specific regions. Market Implications and Trader Opportunities The COLLECT and MAGMA perpetual futures listings create multiple market opportunities. Arbitrage possibilities typically emerge between spot and derivatives markets. Basis trading strategies become feasible with perpetual futures availability. Liquidity providers can capture funding rate differentials systematically. Volatility traders access new instruments for price movement speculation. Additionally, portfolio managers gain additional hedging tools. Historical analysis suggests specific post-listing patterns often occur. Typically, open interest grows steadily during the first trading week. Funding rates fluctuate based on perpetual contract demand imbalances. Cross-exchange arbitrage opportunities emerge temporarily. Market makers provide tighter spreads as liquidity normalizes. The underlying projects often experience increased development activity. Moreover, community engagement typically intensifies following derivatives availability. Risk Management Considerations for Leveraged Trading Twenty-times leverage amplifies both potential profits and losses significantly. Traders must implement rigorous risk management protocols. Position sizing becomes critically important with high leverage. Stop-loss orders help limit downside exposure effectively. Diversification across multiple assets reduces concentration risk. Furthermore, understanding funding rate mechanics proves essential for perpetual futures. Binance provides multiple risk management tools for derivatives traders. The platform offers isolated margin mode for controlled exposure. Liquidation price calculators help traders understand risk thresholds. Insurance funds protect against extreme market conditions. Educational resources explain leverage implications comprehensively. Novice traders should particularly exercise caution with high-leverage products. Additionally, simulated trading environments allow practice without financial risk. Institutional Perspective on New Derivatives Listings Financial institutions monitor exchange derivatives expansions closely. New perpetual futures listings signal institutional-grade infrastructure development. Asset managers consider derivatives availability when evaluating investment opportunities.

According to leading on-chain analytics firm Coin Bureau, the company’s new partnerships with Mizuho Bank, SMBC Nikko, and Securitize Japan are poised to significantly accelerate XRP Ledger (XRPL) adoption across Japan’s financial ecosystem. Japan has long stood out as one of the world’s most crypto-forward jurisdictions, defined by regulatory clarity and deep institutional participation. By partnering with some of the country’s most influential financial institutions, Ripple is positioning the XRP Ledger as enterprise-grade financial infrastructure, not a speculative blockchain experiment. These alliances highlight a broader shift among traditional banks toward blockchain solutions that enhance efficiency, transparency, and cost savings. Notably, this momentum comes as the XRP Ledger sits at the center of the market’s focus, with real-world assets (RWAs) emerging as one of 2025’s most dominant crypto narratives. Well, Mizuho Bank’s participation lends institutional credibility and scale to Ripple’s strategy, signaling strong confidence in the XRP Ledger’s capacity to power real-world use cases such as cross-border payments and liquidity management. On the other hand, SMBC Nikko, the investment banking arm of Sumitomo Mitsui Financial Group, reinforces this momentum by linking blockchain infrastructure with deep capital-markets expertise. Meanwhile, Securitize Japan introduces a tokenization layer, enabling the issuance and management of regulated digital securities on the XRP Ledger, broadening its role from payments to full-stack financial infrastructure. These collaborations underscore Ripple’s long-term strategy of integrating its technology within regulated financial systems, not operating on the margins. With fast settlement, low transaction costs, and an energy-efficient design, the XRP Ledger stands out as a scalable, institution-ready blockchain built to deliver real-world utility without regulatory friction. Beyond the technology itself, these partnerships position Japan as a proving ground for institutional blockchain adoption. A successful rollout could become a template for Ripple’s expansion into other global financial hubs, cementing the XRP Ledger’s role as dependable, enterprise-grade infrastructure for modern finance. At the same time, XRPL is pushing the security frontier with the introduction of quantum-resistant transactions powered by Dilithium cryptography, underscoring its long-term readiness for the future of global payments. Therefore, Ripple’s expansion in Japan signals that institutional crypto adoption is now tangible. As major banks and securities firms integrate blockchain, networks emphasizing compliance, efficiency, and practical utility are poised to lead. Beyond a regional gain, Ripple’s footprint marks a strategic milestone, cementing XRP Ledger’s role at the forefront of traditional finance meeting blockchain innovation. Conclusion Ripple’s partnerships with Mizuho Bank, SMBC Nikko, and Securitize Japan mark a major leap in integrating blockchain with regulated finance. By embedding the XRP Ledger into Japan’s financial infrastructure, Ripple strengthens institutional credibility while setting a global benchmark for adoption. This move highlights a clear trend: the future of finance is digital, and networks like XRP Ledger, fast, efficient, and compliant, are positioned to lead the transformation, with Japan serving as a strategic proving ground for worldwide impact.",News|Ripple,EN,0,0,ASIA|BLOCKCHAIN|WALLET|XRP|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-12-31 12:14:30

They grabbed 12.8% of Europe’s electric vehicle market despite facing new tariffs from the European Union. Dataforce numbers seen by Bloomberg show Chinese brands also passed 13% in hybrid vehicle sales across the EU, EFTA countries, and the UK. BYD and SAIC Motor are leading. Newer players like Chery Automobile and Zhejiang Leapmotor Technology are pushing in too. The reason? Too much manufacturing capacity back in China. Carmakers there are stuck in brutal price wars at home. They need somewhere else to sell. BYD goes all-in on Europe BYD is setting up local factories in Europe. Adding plug-in hybrids and premium brands. Competition at home is getting rough with rivals like Geely and Xiaomi gaining ground fast. The Shenzhen company already did the heavy lifting. Built its brand. Got dealer networks running. Put charging stations across Europe. They want everything ready before the next wave of Chinese competitors arrives. Stella Li is BYD’s executive vice president. She told reporters in Zhengzhou that machinery for their first European factory in Hungary should be installed by year’s end. Test runs start in the first quarter of 2026. Full production begins in the second quarter. Hungary’s not their only project. BYD’s building new plants in Brazil and Turkey. They already have one running in Thailand that started shipping cars to Europe in August. Li admits making cars in Hungary will cost more at first than in China. But she says it’s necessary for building a brand people trust. Costs will drop eventually. It’ll also help them handle whatever happens with tariffs. Another European factory might come later. Li said they’re looking at sites. Spain’s on the list as previously reported Cryptopolitan . “We’ll ramp up our Hungary plant first, then the Brazil facility, and the Turkey one,” she said. “Then we’ll see what’s next, but we don’t have a clear plan yet.” CEO Wang Chuanfu recently sent research and development managers to Europe, Latin America, and the Middle East. They need to adapt vehicle designs for what people want in each place. BYD’s already doing well in major European markets. October numbers tell the story. They registered over four times as many vehicles as Tesla in Germany. Almost seven times more in the UK. That’s from government and trade authority data. Chinese carmakers mostly absorbed the extra fees from EU tariffs on Chinese-made EVs that started late 2024. They also pushed into areas the tariffs don’t touch. Hybrid models. Non-EU markets like the UK. Explosive growth for newer brands Leapmotor’s European EV sales jumped more than 4,000% through October. That’s from Jato Dynamics data. A partnership with Stellantis helped fuel that growth. Stellantis owns Peugeot, Fiat, and Opel. Chery’s Omoda brand saw a 1,100% jump in EV sales during the same period. European automakers are scrambling to keep up. They’re also lobbying officials to ease rules that phase out regular gas and diesel cars. EU officials floated dropping plans to ban new combustion engine vehicle sales by 2035. It’s the latest move to protect one of the continent’s biggest industries from a messy energy transition.

In a statement the FIU said it had identified multiple breaches following a comprehensive on-site inspection of the cryptocurrency exchange conducted between October 16 and October 29, 2024. Thousands of AML Breaches Identified According to the FIU, Korbit committed approximately 22,000 violations related to customer due diligence and transaction-restriction obligations. The FIU states more than 12,800 cases involved failures in customer identification, including accepting unclear or incomplete identity documents, approving accounts with missing or improperly recorded addresses, failing to re-verify customer identities when required and allowing transactions for customers whose money-laundering risk ratings had been upgraded without additional checks. An additional 9,100 cases involved breaches of transaction-restriction rules where Korbit allowed trading activity for customers whose identity verification had not been completed — a direct violation of Korean AML requirements. Transactions With Unregistered Overseas Platforms The FIU also found that Korbit facilitated 19 crypto asset transfers involving three overseas virtual asset service providers that were not registered under South Korean law. Such transactions are explicitly prohibited under the Specified Financial Transaction Information Act. Separately the regulator identified 655 violations related to Korbit’s failure to conduct money-laundering risk assessments before supporting new products, including certain NFT-related services. Accountability Measures In addition to the institutional penalty the FIU said it has also imposed disciplinary measures on senior management. Korbit’s chief executive received a formal caution while the company’s compliance reporting officer was issued a reprimand, reflecting their responsibility for the scale and nature of the violations. The FIU said the sanctions reflect a comprehensive review of the severity of the breaches, their causes, and the company’s corrective actions, as well as precedents under existing law. The regulator added that further details of the sanctions will be published on its website following the completion of procedural steps, including the final confirmation of the fine amount after Korbit is given the opportunity to submit opinions. The FIU emphasized it will continue to pursue follow-up enforcement actions stemming from ongoing inspections and warned that serious violations of AML regulations will be dealt with strictly. “Strengthening AML capabilities and compliance frameworks among virtual asset service providers is essential for the crypto market to grow on the basis of public trust,” the FIU said. Mirae Asset Group Explores Korbit Takeover Earler this month it emerged Mirae Asset Group has opened talks to buy crypto exchange Korbit, as traditional finance keeps circling licensed crypto infrastructure.

Money followed chips, data, and the physical infrastructure needed to run large models, so most stocks tied to servers, storage, cooling, and power were on a bull run. Still though, the S&P 500 index ended the year split between extreme winners and clear losers. Because though iconic as it was, this year did not lift all boats. AI spending made chips, data storage, and infrastructure stocks best-performers The AI trade expanded beyond graphics chips inside the S&P 500. Microsoft, Amazon, Alphabet, and Meta pledged more than $440 billion in combined spending over the next twelve months. The cash targets data centers, networking gear, storage systems, and cooling capacity. Sandisk, Western Digital, and Seagate landed among the strongest gainers. All three sell storage used inside large-scale data centers. Their shares climbed as cloud operators locked in supply deals. AI workloads pushed demand for faster and larger storage pools. That demand fed directly into earnings growth. Within the S&P 500, these names outperformed most traditional tech peers. New additions also played a role. Robinhood, Sandisk, AppLovin, and Carvana joined the S&P 500 during 2025. Each posted triple-digit percentage gains and ranked inside the top twenty performers. Index inclusion increased trading volume and passive fund demand. That flow supported prices during pullbacks. Not every new entrant benefited. Trade Desk posted the worst return in the index, sliding close to 70%. Block fell more than 20%. Coinbase dropped over 6%. Even inside the S&P 500, index entry did not guarantee upside. Single-stock surges define the year’s biggest winners Palantir delivered another triple-digit year, its third in a row, as retail investors stayed adamantly active in the name. The PLTR stock now trades above 180 times forward earnings, a valuation that places it behind only Tesla and Warner Bros. Discovery inside the S&P 500. The multiple expanded as momentum funds stayed involved. Warner Bros. Discovery surged nearly 175% during 2025. Takeover speculation drove the move. The company formally put itself up for sale in October. Paramount Skydance and Netflix emerged as the two main bidders. Both worked to secure financing. The board leaned toward the Netflix proposal. Reports said the board planned to reject Paramount’s offer. Larry Ellison, Oracle chairman and father of Paramount chief executive David Ellison, personally backed the Paramount bid. The bidding war kept shares volatile but elevated. Consumer staples ranked among the worst performers in the S&P 500. Tariffs, inflation, and worries about household spending weighed on demand. Clorox, Lamb Weston, Campbell’s, and Constellation Brands all landed in the bottom twenty. Chipotle dropped nearly 40% after two strong years. Rising costs and slower traffic hit margins. Retail stocks Deckers Outdoor fell almost 50%, ending a nine-year streak of gains, and Lululemon slid close to 45%, after struggling through restructuring and leadership changes. Elliott Investment Management built a stake exceeding $1 billion, but the shares stayed under pressure. Managed care also underperformed. Molina Healthcare fell over 40% for a second straight year. UnitedHealth and Centene dropped more than 30%, placing them among the worst names in the S&P 500. UnitedHealth suffered its worst day since 1998 in April after cutting its forecast.

This CBDC India position represents a significant policy direction with global implications for digital finance. RBI’s Financial Stability Report Details CBDC Priority The Reserve Bank of India released its latest Financial Stability Report with clear directives. The central bank emphasized that stablecoins present substantial macroeconomic risks. Furthermore, the RBI argued these risks outweigh potential benefits from private digital currencies. Consequently, the institution maintains that CBDCs should receive priority in development efforts. India’s central bank has consistently expressed concerns about cryptocurrency volatility. However, its latest report specifically targets stablecoins pegged to traditional currencies. The RBI warns these instruments could undermine monetary policy effectiveness. Additionally, they might create systemic risks during market stress periods. Global Context of Central Bank Digital Currency Development India joins over 130 countries exploring central bank digital currency implementations. The digital rupee pilot program began in December 2022. Since then, the RBI has conducted extensive testing across multiple use cases. These include wholesale transactions, retail payments, and cross-border settlements. Globally, CBDC development follows three primary models: Retail CBDCs: For general public use in daily transactions Wholesale CBDCs: For financial institutions and large-value transfers Hybrid approaches: Combining elements of both systems The digital rupee currently explores both retail and wholesale applications. This dual approach allows India to address different financial system needs simultaneously. Expert Analysis of Stablecoin Risk Assessment Financial stability experts generally support cautious approaches to stablecoin regulation. The Bank for International Settlements published similar concerns in 2023. Their research indicates stablecoins face redemption risks during market crises. Moreover, these digital assets lack deposit insurance protections. Former RBI Deputy Governor R. Gandhi commented on the development. “Central banks must protect monetary sovereignty,” Gandhi explained. “Private stablecoins could fragment payment systems and reduce policy effectiveness.” Comparative Analysis: CBDCs Versus Stablecoins The RBI’s position highlights fundamental differences between these digital currency types: Feature CBDC (Digital Rupee) Private Stablecoins Issuer Reserve Bank of India Private companies Legal Status Legal tender Unregulated assets Backing Full sovereign guarantee Variable reserve assets Monetary Policy Integrated with RBI framework Independent of central bank control Financial Stability Designed to enhance stability Potential systemic risk source This comparison clarifies why the RBI prioritizes CBDC development. Central bank digital currencies maintain existing monetary system integrity. Conversely, stablecoins introduce new variables and potential vulnerabilities. Implementation Timeline for India’s Digital Currency The digital rupee development follows a carefully phased approach. The RBI initiated wholesale pilot testing in November 2022. Retail testing commenced the following month in four cities. Expansion to fifteen additional cities occurred throughout 2023. Key milestones in CBDC India development include: Phase 1 (2022-2023): Limited pilot programs with selected banks Phase 2 (2024): Expanded testing with more users and use cases Phase 3 (2025): Potential gradual public rollout with enhanced features Phase 4 (2026+): Full integration with financial infrastructure This gradual implementation allows thorough testing and risk assessment. The RBI emphasizes safety and stability over rapid deployment. International Regulatory Perspectives India’s approach aligns with several major economies’ cautious stances. The European Union implemented comprehensive crypto-asset regulations in 2024. Similarly, the United States has proposed stricter stablecoin legislation. These developments indicate growing global consensus on digital currency oversight. International Monetary Fund research supports coordinated approaches. Their 2024 working paper recommends clear regulatory frameworks for all digital assets. The paper particularly emphasizes financial stability considerations. Potential Impacts on India’s Financial Ecosystem The RBI’s CBDC priority could reshape India’s financial landscape significantly. A successful digital rupee implementation might reduce cash dependency. Additionally, it could enhance financial inclusion for underserved populations. Potential benefits of CBDC adoption include: Reduced transaction costs for individuals and businesses Improved payment system efficiency and speed Enhanced monetary policy transmission mechanisms Greater transparency in financial transactions Reduced settlement risks in interbank transfers However, challenges remain regarding technology infrastructure and digital literacy. The RBI acknowledges these implementation hurdles in its reports. Conclusion The Reserve Bank of India maintains a clear position on digital currency development. CBDC India initiatives receive priority over private stablecoin adoption. This approach emphasizes financial stability and monetary sovereignty protection. The digital rupee represents a strategic response to evolving payment system demands. Furthermore, it demonstrates careful consideration of emerging financial technology risks. Global central banks increasingly recognize similar priorities as digital currency evolution continues. FAQs Q1: What specific risks does the RBI identify with stablecoins? The RBI highlights several stablecoin risks including potential runs during market stress, fragmentation of payment systems, challenges to monetary policy transmission, lack of deposit insurance, and possible misuse for illicit activities. These concerns stem from stablecoins’ private issuance and variable reserve backing. Q2: How does the digital rupee differ from cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin? The digital rupee is a central bank digital currency with legal tender status, full sovereign backing, and integration with monetary policy. Unlike decentralized cryptocurrencies, CBDCs maintain central bank control, offer stability through direct fiat currency backing, and operate within existing regulatory frameworks. Q3: What stage is India’s CBDC development currently in? India’s digital rupee is in advanced pilot testing phases. The RBI has conducted both wholesale and retail testing since late 2022, with gradual expansion to more cities and use cases. The central bank follows a cautious, phased approach emphasizing security and stability over rapid deployment. Q4: How might CBDCs affect ordinary citizens’ daily transactions? Successful CBDC implementation could provide citizens with digital cash alternatives offering instant settlement, potentially lower transaction costs, enhanced security features, and greater accessibility. However, implementation must address digital literacy and infrastructure challenges to ensure broad accessibility. Q5: Are other countries taking similar approaches to stablecoins and CBDCs? Many major economies share India’s cautious approach to stablecoins while developing CBDCs. The European Union, United Kingdom, United States, and China are all developing regulatory frameworks for stablecoins while advancing their own central bank digital currency research and pilot programs with similar stability concerns.

This article provides a detailed, evidence-based TRUMP meme coin price prediction, examining the factors that could influence its value from 2026 through 2030 and addressing the pivotal question of a potential $50 valuation. TRUMP Meme Coin: Market Context and Historical Performance The $TRUMP token, a digital asset launched on the Solana blockchain, represents a unique segment within the cryptocurrency ecosystem. Unlike traditional cryptocurrencies, its value is intrinsically linked to political sentiment and internet culture. Consequently, analysts must consider a dual framework for any TRUMP price prediction, evaluating both standard crypto market dynamics and the unpredictable nature of meme-driven assets. Historical data shows extreme volatility, with prices reacting sharply to political news cycles and social media trends. For instance, major political events have previously triggered significant price movements. This pattern establishes a crucial precedent for future analysis. Market capitalization and trading volume provide additional context, highlighting the coin’s niche but active position within the broader altcoin market. Furthermore, the token’s utility—or frequent lack thereof—remains a central debate among blockchain experts assessing its long-term viability beyond speculative trading. Methodology for the 2026-2030 Price Forecast Constructing a reliable forecast requires a multi-faceted approach. This analysis synthesizes quantitative technical analysis, qualitative sentiment indicators, and broader macroeconomic projections. Key metrics include on-chain transaction data, holder distribution patterns, and liquidity pool health on decentralized exchanges. Simultaneously, analysts monitor social media engagement rates and search trend data as proxies for retail investor interest. Expert Perspectives on Meme Coin Valuation Financial analysts specializing in digital assets often emphasize the high-risk profile of meme coins. Reports from firms like CoinShares and Galaxy Digital frequently categorize such assets as having “asymmetric return profiles,” where outsized gains are possible but accompanied by substantial risk of loss. The consensus suggests that any long-term TRUMP price prediction must heavily weight external catalysts, particularly political developments, over pure financial modeling. Regulatory developments also form a critical part of the outlook. Potential legislation targeting digital assets, especially those tied to public figures, could dramatically alter the operational landscape. The evolving stance of bodies like the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) on asset classification is a variable that could impact trading access and liquidity for all speculative tokens, including $TRUMP. Annual Price Projection Analysis (2026-2030) The following table outlines a scenario-based forecast, presenting potential price ranges under different market conditions. These figures are illustrative models, not financial advice, based on extrapolated volatility and assumed adoption rates. Year Bull Case Scenario Base Case Scenario Bear Case Scenario Primary Catalyst 2026 $8 – $15 $4 – $7 $1 – $3 Election cycle sentiment, crypto market cycle phase. 2027 $12 – $25 $6 – $11 $2 – $5 Post-election narrative, broader meme coin sector performance. 2028 $18 – $35 $9 – $17 $3 – $8 Technological integration (e.g., new blockchain features), regulatory clarity. 2029 $25 – $45 $13 – $24 $5 – $12 Macroeconomic conditions, institutional crypto adoption trends. 2030 $30 – $60+ $15 – $29 $6 – $14 Cumulative network effects, long-term holder consolidation. Reaching the $50 threshold, therefore, appears most plausible in a sustained bull market scenario toward the end of the decade. This would require a confluence of positive factors: Favorable Crypto Macrocycle: Alignment with a broader cryptocurrency bull market. Sustained Political Relevance: Continued high engagement with the associated political figure. Ecosystem Development: Expansion of use cases or community-driven utility. Market Liquidity: Significant increase in trading volume and capital inflow. Critical Risk Factors and Volatility Considerations Investors must acknowledge the inherent risks. Meme coins are exceptionally vulnerable to sentiment shifts. A single negative news event or a change in social media discourse can precipitate rapid devaluation. Furthermore, the competitive landscape is fierce. New meme coins constantly emerge, vying for community attention and capital. The $TRUMP token must maintain a dedicated holder base to avoid liquidity decay. Technological risk on the Solana network, though diminished over time, also remains a factor. Network outages or congestion could temporarily impact trading. Ultimately, any investment in this asset class should be considered highly speculative. Analysts consistently advise that capital allocated should be discretionary funds that one can afford to lose entirely, given the asset’s unpredictable nature. Conclusion This TRUMP meme coin price prediction illustrates a range of possible outcomes from 2026 to 2030. While a path to $50 exists within optimistic long-term models, it is contingent on a perfect storm of market, political, and community factors. The primary takeaway for observers is the paramount importance of external catalysts over intrinsic value in driving price action for such tokens. Responsible analysis stresses rigorous risk assessment and emphasizes that forecasts for politically-linked digital assets are inherently more uncertain than those for cryptocurrencies with established technological fundamentals. FAQs Q1: What is the main driver of the TRUMP meme coin’s price? The price is primarily driven by social sentiment, political news cycles, and overall cryptocurrency market trends, rather than technological utility or corporate earnings. Q2: How does the $TRUMP token differ from traditional cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin? Unlike Bitcoin, which markets itself as “digital gold,” $TRUMP is a meme coin whose value is largely derived from community culture and topical relevance, not a decentralized monetary policy or store-of-value proposition. Q3: What are the biggest risks of investing in a political meme coin? The biggest risks include extreme volatility, high susceptibility to negative news or fading relevance, potential regulatory scrutiny, and the speculative nature that can lead to rapid loss of value. Q4: Can technical analysis reliably predict the price of a meme coin? While technical analysis can identify trends and patterns, its reliability is lower for meme coins due to their disproportionate sensitivity to unpredictable external events and social media hype. Q5: Where is the $TRUMP token traded? The $TRUMP token is primarily traded on decentralized exchanges (DEXs) on the Solana blockchain, such as Raydium and Orca, and may also be listed on some centralized exchanges that support Solana-based assets.

As momentum builds beneath the surface, attention is focused on a decisive breakout or breakdown that could define Bitcoin’s next major move. Bitcoin Trapped In Post-Breakdown Compression According to analyst CyrilXBT, Bitcoin remains mired in a period of intense price compression following its significant breakdown from the $100,000 threshold. This cooling-off phase reflects the market’s attempt to stabilize after being rejected at a historic milestone, resulting in a loss of immediate upward momentum. Related Reading: Bitcoin Hovering In A Descending Range, But Alts Are Quietly Gaining Momentum The current technical structure is defined by a series of lower highs, which are effectively squeezing the price into an increasingly narrow corridor. This tightening action is concentrated around the $88,000 to $90,000 range. It creates a high-pressure environment where the asset is searching for its next definitive directional catalyst. CyrilXBT characterizes this current behavior as “classic post-distribution chop,” a phase typically followed by a period where large holders exit positions, leading to erratic sideways movement. It also serves as a necessary reset before a new trend can be established. Looking forward, the market is approaching a period of increased volatility that could resolve in two ways. Bitcoin will either stage a bullish breakout through the descending trendline or undergo a final “flush” to the downside, wiping out over-leveraged long positions. Ultimately, this consolidation serves as a strategic battleground to determine which market participants will be shaken out before the next major move. Price Compression Signals A Bigger Move Ahead In a market assessment, Daan Crypto Trades observed that despite the ongoing sideways movement, Bitcoin’s underlying market health remains stable. Specifically, both the BTC funding rates and the spot premium have held their ground, suggesting that the current chop hasn’t yet led to the massive de-leveraging or sentiment shifts often seen during volatile corrections. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Remains Stuck Inside This Range, But A Breakout Could Follow As Bitcoin remains compressed within this range, a major volatility expansion is highly likely. Based on current trends, a decisive move is expected to materialize within the next one to two weeks as the market reaches a breaking point in its consolidation. The primary recommendation during this uncertain phase is to exercise patience and wait for a confirmed breakout rather than attempting to trade every minor fluctuation. By avoiding the temptation to over-leverage in the middle of this range, traders can protect their capital and wait for clear confirmation of the next trend.

Market experts think there’s more weakness coming, and it depends on who ends up running the Federal Reserve. The Bloomberg Dollar Spot Index has fallen 8.1% this year. That’s the steepest yearly drop in eight years. The dollar got hammered after President Donald Trump rolled out his April tariffs, which he called “Liberation Day”, and it’s been under pressure ever since. Trump has been pushing hard for a more accommodating Fed chairman to take over next year, and that’s kept the currency on the back foot. Yusuke Miyairi analyzes foreign exchange markets at Nomura. He said “The biggest factor for the dollar in first quarter will be the Fed,” adding that “it’s not just the meetings in January and March, but who will be the Fed Chair after Jerome Powell ends his term.” Markets are betting on at least two interest rate cuts next year. That puts American monetary policy out of step with several other wealthy nations, making the dollar less appealing to investors. Europe’s currency has been gaining against the dollar. Inflation there has stayed manageable, and there’s a wave of military spending on the horizon. That’s keeping expectations for rate cuts close to zero. Canada, Sweden, and Australia are different stories; traders are actually betting on rate hikes in those countries. The Commodity Futures Trading Commission puts out data on currency positioning. For the week ending December 16, it showed something interesting. There was a brief moment this month when people got bullish on the dollar again. That didn’t last. It flipped back to the pessimistic view that’s been around since those April tariffs got everyone worried about the American economy. All eyes on Powell’s replacement Right now, everything comes down to the Fed and who’s replacing Jerome Powell. His term as chairman ends in May. Trump dropped hints recently that he’s picked someone but won’t say who yet. He’s also floated the idea of firing the current Fed leader before the term is up. Kevin Hassett runs the National Economic Council. He’s been seen as the front-runner for a while now. Trump’s also talked about Kevin Warsh, who used to be a Fed governor. Then there are Fed governors Christopher Waller and Michelle Bowman. Rick Rieder from BlackRock is in the mix too. Andrew Hazlett trades foreign currencies at Monex Inc. He explained, “Hassett would be more or less priced in since he has been the frontrunner for some time now, but Warsh or Waller would likely not be as quick to cut, which would be better for the dollar.” Fed officials split on next moves Federal Reserve officials can’t seem to agree on when they’ll cut borrowing costs again. Most think more cuts could happen if inflation keeps cooling. But several officials want rates to stay where they are for a while. That came out in meeting records released Tuesday. The minutes from the Fed’s December 9-10 session showed the disagreements aren’t going away as previously reported by Cryptopolitan. Most backed another rate cut last month, but it wasn’t an easy call for everyone. The Fed voted 9-3 to trim its key rate by a quarter point in December. That’s three cuts in a row now. The rate is between 3.5% and 3.75%, as Cryptopolitan previously reported. The minutes stated that “A few of those who supported lowering the policy rate at this meeting indicated that the decision was finely balanced or that they could have supported keeping the target range unchanged.” Officials changed their statement after the meeting. The new version showed they’re less certain about when future cuts will happen. Their middle projection had just one quarter-point reduction coming in 2026. Individual forecasts were all over the place, though. Market watchers are putting their money on at least two cuts next year.

This move highlights a calculated shift in strategy from a core blue-chip asset to what he views as higher-growth opportunities within decentralized finance. Hayes Trims ETH Exposure as DeFi Takes Priority Blockchain analytics firm Lookonchain reported on December 31 that the BitMEX co-founder sold 1,871 ETH over the past two weeks before buying roughly $4.6 million worth of DeFi-related tokens. Initial purchases included around $1.8 million in Pendle, $1.3 million in Lido DAO (LDO), $1.2 million in Ethena (ENA), and about $340,000 in Ether.fi (ETHFI). Minutes later, Lookonchain published a follow-up update showing Hayes doubling down on two of those positions. According to the data, he bought an additional 4.86 million ENA, worth about $986,000, and 697,851 ETHFI, valued at nearly $485,000, bringing his total redeployed capital to well over $6 million. The trader had already telegraphed this shift earlier in the month, posting on X that his portfolio was rotating out of ETH and into “high-quality DeFi names,” arguing they could do better if fiat liquidity continues to loosen. This is not the first time Hayes has made large-scale portfolio adjustments. In November, he engaged in a similar selling event during a market downturn, disposing of ETH, ENA, and ETHFI. That activity followed a prior sale in August, after which he humorously pledged never to take profits again. The community response to the investor’s move has been mixed. While some observers view it as a bullish signal for the selected DeFi sector, others have urged caution. A social media user, Junar, responded to the news with a warning: “the same guy sell his assets in loss so don’t fomo buy here.” Price Action Paints a Mixed Picture for DeFi Bets Price data shows why opinions remain divided. According to CoinGecko, ETH is trading around $3,000, roughly flat on the week and up close to 5% over 30 days, even as it remains about 11% lower than a year ago. By contrast, most of the DeFi tokens Hayes bought have shown short-term rebounds but remain deeply underwater on longer horizons. At the time of writing, Pendle was near $2.00, up almost 14% on the week but down more than 60% year-on-year. Lido’s LDO was sitting around $0.60, with an 11% weekly gain that has done little to offset losses of nearly 68% across twelve months. Meanwhile, ENA is trading close to $0.20 after slipping over 15% in 30 days and more than 75% since last year, while ETHFI is hovering near $0.70, still more than 90% below its early 2024 peak.

Uganda is preparing for general elections in mid-January 2026, an event that has historically prompted the country’s ruling administration to shut down internet services and block social media. Bobi Wine, Uganda’s opposition leader, urged his supporters to download a decentralized peer-to-peer messaging service, Bitchat, as the country gears up for elections on January 14, 2026. The politician alleged that the current regime in Uganda will try to shut down communication services during the democratic process to prevent the mobilization of protests and the verification of election results. Bobi Wine calls for Bitchat usage amid concerns about internet shutdown Bobi Wine wrote on X that Uganda’s current government is plotting to block internet services in the country and restrict information relay on social media channels. Wine claims that the regime has done so in the past elections and could be laying down plots to do the same in the upcoming elections. HAVE YOU DOWNLOADED BITCHAT YET? As we all know, the regime is plotting an internet shutdown in the coming days, like they have done in all previous elections. They switch off the internet in order to block communication and ensure that citizens do not organise, verify their… pic.twitter.com/KPVyc0ZW4H — BOBI WINE (@HEBobiwine) December 30, 2025 In 2016, Uganda’s current and longest-serving president, Yoweri Museveni, blocked internet and social media access in the country, citing concerns over safety and security. Wine emphasized that Bitchat will allow users to “communicate with thousands of people in record time” when the government shuts down the internet. He also explained that users “will be able to send pictures of DR Forms and share any other critical information to specific or other users” through the platform. A report from the Pan-African Human Rights Defenders Network, a human rights umbrella organization, stated that Museveni disconnected the entire country from internet access during the 2021 elections. The organization noted that the internet blockage lasted approximately 4 days, from the day before the election (January 13) to January 18. Jack Dorsey, co-founder and former Twitter (now X) exec, launched Bitchat in July this year. The application provides a peer-to-peer messaging platform that enables users to send messages offline via Bluetooth, eliminating the need for an internet connection. The Bitchat application utilizes a decentralized infrastructure that prevents users from providing personal details, such as phone numbers and email addresses, to use the platform, unlike traditional messaging platforms. Bitchat saw widespread usage during protests in Madagascar in September this year. The application received over 70,000 downloads from the country alone in just one week. Protests in Nepal also prompted nearly 50,000 downloads in the country on September 8 alone. Ugandan government restricts Starlink importation and usage The news comes after the Ugandan government issued a memo restricting the importation of Starlink, a satellite internet constellation by Elon Musk’s SpaceX. The internet firm provides high-speed connections even in remote areas that previously had no reliable options. The memo detailed that any importation of Starlink and its associated equipment should “be accompanied by a clearance certificate/authorization letter from the Chief of Defense Forces.” The restriction also comes just weeks before Uganda’s elections, where Yoweri Museveni will face his leading contender Bobi Wine for the second time. Bobi Wine said that the ruling regime is operating in fear and asked the government why it was so concerned about people accessing the internet, if it was not planning mischief or electoral fraud. Starlink has not received a formal license to operate in Uganda. However, citizens in the country have been importing the equipment and using the internet services. Starlink has secured operating licenses in over 20 African countries, including Nigeria, Kenya, Somalia, and Zambia. However, significant regulatory hurdles in some African countries have restricted Starlink’s expansion plan. Cameroon, Zimbabwe, South Africa, and Sudan have emerged as complex markets for Starlink due to regulatory constraints.

This remarkable figure significantly undercut economist forecasts of 219,000 claims, marking one of the strongest weekly employment readings in recent months. The Department of Labor’s Thursday morning release immediately captured market attention, suggesting underlying economic strength despite broader concerns about slowing growth. US Jobless Claims Show Unexpected December Strength The Labor Department’s weekly unemployment insurance report revealed that seasonally adjusted initial claims totaled 199,000 for the week ending December 27, 2024. This represents a substantial 20,000-claim improvement over consensus expectations. Furthermore, the four-week moving average—a more stable measure that smooths weekly volatility—declined to 213,750 from the previous week’s revised average of 218,000. Continuing claims, which track Americans receiving ongoing unemployment benefits, also decreased to 1.865 million for the week ending December 20. Several key factors contributed to this unexpectedly strong performance: Seasonal hiring patterns: Retail and logistics sectors maintained robust staffing Service sector resilience: Hospitality and healthcare employment remained stable Geographic distribution: No single state reported significant layoff surges Historical context: December typically sees lower claims due to holiday hiring December 2024 Jobless Claims Comparison Week Ending Initial Claims Forecast Difference Dec 6 225,000 220,000 +5,000 Dec 13 215,000 218,000 -3,000 Dec 20 210,000 215,000 -5,000 Dec 27 199,000 219,000 -20,000 Labor Market Analysis and Economic Context Economists immediately began analyzing the implications of this surprisingly low claims number. Historically, initial claims below 200,000 indicate exceptionally tight labor market conditions. The December reading represents the lowest weekly total since September 2024 and continues a gradual downward trend observed throughout the fourth quarter. This data arrives amid mixed economic signals, including moderating inflation and steady consumer spending patterns. Market analysts note several contextual factors. First, seasonal adjustments for holiday periods can sometimes create statistical anomalies. Second, employers may have delayed planned layoffs until after the new year. Third, the data reflects ongoing structural shifts in the labor market, including persistent worker shortages in certain sectors. Nevertheless, the consistent downward trajectory across multiple weeks suggests genuine underlying strength rather than statistical noise. Expert Perspectives on Employment Trends Leading labor economists emphasize the significance of this data point within broader economic trends. “The 199,000 claims figure represents more than just a weekly anomaly,” explains Dr. Elena Rodriguez, labor economist at the Brookings Institution. “It reflects sustained employer confidence and continued labor market tightness despite broader economic headwinds. Employers appear reluctant to reduce workforces amid ongoing recruitment challenges.” Federal Reserve officials monitor initial claims closely as a real-time labor market indicator. The unexpectedly strong December data may influence monetary policy discussions regarding interest rate trajectories. However, most analysts caution against overinterpreting a single week’s data, noting that monthly employment reports provide more comprehensive labor market assessments. Historical Comparisons and Seasonal Patterns Examining historical December claims data reveals important context for the current reading. Over the past decade, December initial claims have averaged approximately 235,000, making the 199,000 figure particularly notable. The pre-pandemic five-year average for December stood at 245,000 claims, while pandemic-era comparisons remain less relevant due to extraordinary labor market disruptions. Several seasonal factors typically influence December claims data: Retail sector hiring for holiday shopping seasons Reduced layoff announcements during holiday periods Administrative processing delays around holidays Year-end business planning affecting workforce decisions Despite these seasonal considerations, the magnitude of the deviation from forecasts suggests genuine labor market strength. The data aligns with other positive employment indicators, including steady hiring rates and sustained wage growth across multiple sectors. Manufacturing and construction employment have shown particular resilience despite higher interest rates. Regional Variations and Sector Performance The Labor Department’s state-level data reveals important geographic patterns. No state reported particularly elevated claims during the December 21-27 period. California, Texas, and New York—typically the largest contributors to national claims totals—all reported stable or declining numbers. The Midwest and Southeast regions showed particular strength, with several states reporting claims near multi-year lows. Sector-specific analysis provides additional insights. Technology sector layoffs, which elevated claims throughout 2023, have moderated significantly. Meanwhile, healthcare and education employment continue expanding steadily. The transportation and warehousing sector shows mixed signals, with some regional variations but overall stability. These patterns suggest balanced labor market conditions rather than concentrated strength in specific industries. Implications for Monetary Policy and Markets Financial markets responded immediately to the stronger-than-expected claims data. Treasury yields edged higher as investors adjusted expectations for Federal Reserve policy. Equity markets showed mixed reactions, balancing positive labor market implications against potential interest rate concerns. The data arrives ahead of the January Federal Open Market Committee meeting, where policymakers will assess multiple labor market indicators. Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell has repeatedly emphasized data-dependent decision-making. While inflation remains the primary policy focus, labor market conditions significantly influence broader economic assessments. The December claims data supports arguments for continued labor market resilience but doesn’t necessarily alter the broader disinflation narrative that has dominated recent policy discussions. Broader Economic Indicators and Future Outlook The jobless claims report represents just one component of comprehensive labor market analysis. Upcoming December employment data will provide more complete assessment, including nonfarm payrolls, unemployment rates, and wage growth metrics. Most economists expect continued moderate job creation in the 150,000-200,000 range for December, consistent with gradual labor market normalization. Several forward-looking indicators suggest sustained labor market health: Job openings remain elevated relative to historical norms Quit rates indicate continued worker confidence Business hiring plans show cautious optimism Initial public offering activity suggests corporate confidence However, potential headwinds persist. Global economic uncertainty, geopolitical tensions, and domestic political transitions could affect business confidence. Additionally, certain sectors face structural challenges, including commercial real estate and specific manufacturing segments. The overall labor market picture remains complex, with strength in some areas offsetting weakness in others. Methodological Considerations and Data Quality The Department of Labor’s weekly claims report represents one of the most timely economic indicators available. Data collection occurs through state unemployment insurance programs, with rigorous quality controls and seasonal adjustment methodologies. However, analysts note several methodological considerations when interpreting December data specifically. Holiday weeks present particular challenges for seasonal adjustment models. The Christmas and New Year holidays can affect both claim filing patterns and administrative processing. Additionally, year-end business practices sometimes delay workforce adjustments until January. These factors suggest some potential mean reversion in early January data, though the underlying trend appears positive. Longer-term data quality improvements have enhanced report reliability. Electronic filing systems have reduced administrative delays, while enhanced fraud detection has improved data accuracy. These improvements support confidence in the reported 199,000 figure, though weekly volatility remains inherent to high-frequency labor market indicators. Conclusion The December jobless claims report delivered unexpectedly positive news about US labor market conditions. The 199,000 initial claims total significantly undershot forecasts and represents one of the strongest weekly readings in recent months. This data suggests sustained employer confidence and continued labor market tightness despite broader economic uncertainties. While seasonal factors and weekly volatility require cautious interpretation, the consistent downward trend in claims throughout the fourth quarter indicates genuine underlying strength. The report reinforces assessments of a resilient US economy navigating complex global conditions while maintaining robust employment fundamentals. Future labor market developments will depend on multiple factors, but current data suggests a stable foundation for continued economic expansion. FAQs Q1: What are initial jobless claims and why do they matter? Initial jobless claims represent the number of people filing for unemployment benefits for the first time each week. They serve as a real-time indicator of labor market health, with lower numbers suggesting stronger employment conditions and higher numbers indicating potential economic weakness. Q2: How significant is the 199,000 claims figure historically? The 199,000 reading represents one of the lowest weekly totals in recent years. Historically, claims below 200,000 indicate exceptionally tight labor market conditions. The figure is particularly notable for December, which often sees elevated claims due to seasonal factors. Q3: Could seasonal adjustments be distorting the December data? Seasonal adjustments always affect labor market data, particularly around holidays. However, the magnitude of the deviation from forecasts (20,000 claims below expectations) suggests genuine strength rather than statistical artifact. The consistent downward trend across multiple weeks supports this interpretation. Q4: How does this data affect Federal Reserve policy decisions? The Federal Reserve monitors jobless claims as a key labor market indicator. Strong claims data supports arguments for maintaining current policy or potentially tightening further if inflation concerns persist. However, the Fed considers multiple indicators, making any single data point just one factor in complex policy decisions. Q5: What sectors showed particular strength in the December report? While detailed sector data comes with a lag, the overall strength suggests broad-based stability. Healthcare, education, and professional services have shown consistent resilience. Retail and logistics employment typically strengthens during holiday seasons, contributing to lower claims.

This initiative marks one of the first instances of a publicly traded company directly issuing utility tokens to equity holders, potentially setting a new precedent for shareholder engagement in the digital age. Trump Media Cryptocurrency Distribution Mechanics The distribution plan follows a straightforward yet innovative structure. For each share of DJT common stock held, shareholders will receive one digital token. Importantly, the company clarified that these tokens will not have a cash value or represent equity in Trump Media. Instead, they will function as utility tokens providing access to specific benefits and services within the Trump Media ecosystem. The distribution will occur through Crypto.com’s institutional platform, leveraging their established infrastructure for secure digital asset delivery. This approach differs significantly from traditional stock dividends or cash distributions. The token’s utility-based model focuses on enhancing user engagement with Trump Media’s platforms, including Truth Social. Consequently, the program aims to deepen the connection between shareholders and the company’s core products. Industry analysts note this could create a more loyal user base while providing shareholders with tangible benefits beyond financial returns. Corporate Strategy Behind Digital Token Initiatives The partnership with Crypto.com provides crucial technical expertise and regulatory navigation. Crypto.com, a major global cryptocurrency exchange with operations in over 90 countries, brings established compliance frameworks and user verification systems. This collaboration suggests Trump Media is prioritizing secure, compliant distribution to avoid regulatory pitfalls that have ensnared other crypto initiatives. Several factors likely influenced this strategic decision: Enhanced Shareholder Loyalty: Utility tokens can transform passive investors into active platform users. Platform Growth Incentives: Token benefits may drive increased engagement on Truth Social and other services. Innovation Signaling: The move positions Trump Media at the forefront of corporate digital asset adoption. Regulatory Caution: By avoiding cash value, the company may seek to navigate securities regulations more carefully. Expert Analysis on Market Implications Financial technology experts point to broader trends in corporate cryptocurrency adoption. “We’re witnessing a maturation in how public companies integrate blockchain technology,” notes Dr. Elena Rodriguez, Director of Digital Asset Research at Stanford University. “Unlike the speculative ICO boom of 2017-2018, current corporate token initiatives increasingly focus on utility and ecosystem building rather than pure fundraising.” Historical context reveals this isn’t the first corporate crypto distribution. However, previous attempts by companies like Overstock.com focused more on dividend alternatives. The Trump Media approach appears uniquely centered on creating a closed-loop ecosystem where token utility directly correlates with platform usage. This model could influence how other media and technology companies engage their investor communities. The announcement follows increased regulatory clarity from the SEC regarding digital assets. Recent guidelines distinguish between security tokens and utility tokens more clearly. Trump Media’s explicit statement that tokens “will not have a cash value” seems designed to align with these regulatory distinctions, potentially avoiding classification as a security offering. Shareholder Considerations and Practical Impacts For DJT shareholders, several practical considerations emerge. The distribution mechanism requires shareholders to have or create a Crypto.com account to receive their tokens. The company will likely provide detailed instructions on claim procedures, verification requirements, and timing. Shareholders should prepare for this technical process, which may involve identity verification steps common to regulated cryptocurrency platforms. The specific benefits attached to the tokens remain partially undefined. However, based on similar utility token models, potential benefits could include: Premium features on Truth Social Exclusive content access Platform governance participation Merchandise discounts Event access privileges Market reaction to the announcement has been mixed. Some analysts praise the innovative approach to shareholder value beyond traditional metrics. Others caution about implementation complexity and the challenge of creating meaningful utility that retains long-term value. The success of similar programs at companies like Reddit (with Community Points) suggests utility tokens can foster engagement when properly designed. Conclusion The Trump Media cryptocurrency distribution represents a significant experiment in corporate-shareholder relations. By leveraging Crypto.com’s infrastructure to issue utility tokens, the company blends traditional equity ownership with digital ecosystem participation. This initiative could pioneer new models for how public companies engage stakeholders beyond financial returns. As regulatory frameworks evolve and digital asset adoption grows, such hybrid approaches may become more common across multiple industries. The ultimate impact will depend on execution quality, regulatory compliance, and the tangible value shareholders derive from their digital tokens. FAQs Q1: When will Trump Media distribute the cryptocurrency tokens to shareholders? The company has announced the plan but hasn’t released specific distribution dates. Typically, such distributions follow a record date announcement where shareholders must hold shares by a certain date to qualify. Trump Media will likely provide a detailed timeline in upcoming SEC filings. Q2: Do shareholders need a Crypto.com account to receive their tokens? Yes, based on the partnership announcement, distribution will occur through Crypto.com’s platform. Shareholders will probably need to create an account, complete identity verification, and follow specific claim instructions to receive their tokens securely. Q3: Can shareholders sell or trade these Trump Media tokens? The company states the tokens “will not have a cash value” and are designed for utility within Trump Media services. This suggests they may not be tradable on public exchanges initially. However, secondary markets could potentially emerge if demand develops, though regulatory restrictions might apply. Q4: How does this differ from a traditional stock dividend? Unlike cash or stock dividends that provide direct financial value, these utility tokens offer access to services and benefits. They don’t represent equity ownership or guaranteed financial returns. The value derives from their utility within Trump Media’s ecosystem rather than market trading. Q5: What are the tax implications of receiving these cryptocurrency tokens? Tax treatment will depend on jurisdiction and how regulators classify the tokens. In the United States, the IRS typically treats cryptocurrency receipts as taxable events. Shareholders should consult tax professionals regarding their specific situations once the company releases detailed distribution information.

CZ made the comments during a conversation with Bilal bin Saqib, head of the Pakistan Crypto Council, and his forecast has been picked up by several outlets. Pakistan Moves Fast To Build Rulebook Reports have disclosed that Pakistan has already put several pieces in place that could support rapid growth in virtual assets. The Pakistan Virtual Assets Regulatory Authority (PVARA) has issued initial clearances — so-called No Objection Certificates — allowing global exchanges such as Binance and HTX to register local units and begin preparing full licence applications. Those steps stop short of final licences, but they open the door for regulated operations inside the country.

Timestamps: – Why Pakistan for Crypto?:… pic.twitter.com/ILGHOMBdWY — Pakistan Virtual Assets Regulatory Authority (@PakistanVARA) December 30, 2025 Officials And Advisers Lend Credibility Based on reports, CZ’s role is described as a strategic adviser to Pakistan’s crypto effort, working with local leaders including Bilal bin Saqib. The state is also reported to be staffing a new Pakistan Crypto Council and to have moved quickly to draft a Virtual Assets Act and related rules. These moves are meant to reassure international players that the market will be governed. Pakistan could be a crypto leader in 5 years at current pace: CZ Former Binance boss Changpeng Zhao has praised Pakistan for its speedy crypto adoption in 2025, saying the country is on track to become a crypto leader by 2030. #bitcoin #ethereum — Insider.Space (@InsiderDotSpace) December 31, 2025 Tokenization And A Big Dollar Figure Reports show discussions between Pakistan and Binance about tokenizing sovereign assets — government bonds, bills and commodity reserves — with an early figure floated at up to $2 billion. That project, if carried out, would be one of the biggest sovereign tokenization efforts yet and could attract fresh foreign capital for Pakistan’s treasury. Stablecoin Plans And A Central Bank Pilot Based on reports, PVARA officials have said the country will “definitely launch” a national stablecoin as part of the strategy to modernize payments and support tokenized debt. At the same time, the central bank has signaled work on a pilot central bank digital currency (CBDC). Those twin tracks — a government-backed stablecoin plus a CBDC test — are being watched closely by market participants. Reports have also highlighted Pakistan’s large crypto user base and its interest in using surplus power for Bitcoin mining and AI data centers. Some estimates cited by news wires place crypto users in the country at roughly 15–20 million, and officials say parts of the plan are aimed at turning excess electricity into economic activity. Observers warn that legal steps taken so far include ordinances that need parliamentary approval, and that some measures remain temporary unless passed into law. The Virtual Assets Ordinance and related rules have timelines attached, which means regulators must follow through fast to lock in investor confidence.

Over the past two weeks, he reportedly sold 1,871 Ether tokens, worth approximately $5.53 million, and reallocated his proceeds to DeFi. He acquired nearly a million PENDLE tokens worth around $1.75 million, 2.3 million LDO ($1.29 million), 6.05 million ENA ($1.24 million), and 491,000 ETHFI, valued at approximately $343,000. Hayes isn’t new to ETH sell-offs ; he also recently moved $2 million worth of ETH, about 682 ETH, to Binance. Hayes’ assets now mainly comprise DeFi and stablecoin tokens Arthur Hayes didn’t just sell ETH — he also transferred $2.52 million from exchanges into DeFi assets. Now, more than 60% of his portfolio is comprised of DeFi and stablecoins, with ETH holdings taking a backseat. Specifically, Hayes’ portfolio is most concentrated on PENDLE, with the token accounting for nearly half of the allocation. However, all three DeFi assets, PENDLE, LDO, and ETHFI, are still in a downturn, yet Hayes is holding out for a possible bounce. So far, his approach has inspired optimism in DeFi, although his Ethereum selloff has rattled some people. Moreover, Ethereum’s continued inability to reclaim $3,000 is dampening market sentiment. However, in recent weeks, the network has seen some positives. For instance, Etherscan notes that Ethereum processed 2.2 million transactions on Tuesday, setting a new weekly record, with transaction fees significantly lower than their peak in May 2022, which exceeded $200. High Ethereum fees previously caused users to rely on layer 2 networks; however, the number of Ethereum mainnet transactions is increasing, possibly hinting at a return to layer 1. Some X users applauded Hayes for the move, but others suggested the trader may have had greater market knowledge, and some criticized him for his position. One X user remarked , “DeFi rotation makes sense given the ETH upgrade delays.” However, he cautioned, “Still, those yields come with a price.” Ethereum is becoming the global settlement layer While Ethereum’s price is down, the network is being used increasingly by developers, according to Token Terminal data. During the fourth quarter, 8.7 million smart contracts were created. The analytics firm attributes the growth to RWA tokenization, stablecoin trends, and infrastructure development, saying, “Ethereum is quietly becoming the global settlement layer.” With layer-1 competitors, such as Solana, chasing high throughput and low fees, Avalanche pursues customizable subnets. Meanwhile, BNB Chain , utilizing exchange-linked liquidity, data shows that Ethereum remains a core part of the digital asset ecosystem. Researchers at RedStone have even pointed to Ethereum as the “institutional standard” due to its security, liquidity, and infrastructure. Meanwhile, the network continues to anchor the stablecoin market, with more than half of the $307 billion in supply. The network rolled out two major upgrades this year, which likely helped boost transactions and reduce fees. In May, the Pectra upgrade brought improvements to validators, enhanced staking options, and prepared Ethereum for future scalability features. On the other hand, Fusaka expanded the gas limit to 60 million and focused on enhancing network efficiency, scalability, and data handling. Over 50% of validators had signaled support in February to increase Ethereum’s block gas limit, boosting transaction capacity per block.

(Nasdaq, NYSE Texas: DJT) announced on Wednesday that it will distribute a new digital token to its shareholders in 2026, a move that underscores the company’s deepening foray into the cryptocurrency and Web3 ecosystem. The initiative, developed in partnership with Crypto.com, aims to create a novel type of reward mechanism linked to Trump Media’s expanding portfolio of products and services. According to the press release , each ultimate beneficial owner of DJT stock is expected to be eligible for one digital token per whole share they hold, though specific record dates and additional terms will be revealed in 2026. The announcement triggered a positive response in markets, with DJT shares rising by up to 6% in pre-market trading as investors reacted to the news. Tokens linked to platform rewards, not equity The company clarified that the digital tokens are not intended to reflect equity ownership in Trump Media nor confer economic rights tied to profits or management control. The press release specified that the tokens may be non-transferable and not redeemable for cash, and that eligibility will be limited to “ultimate beneficial owners” rather than borrowers or short-term holders of DJT shares. Trump Media’s CEO and Chairman, Devin Nunes, framed the planned token distribution as a way to “reward Trump Media shareholders” and to take advantage of advances in blockchain technology to help promote what he described as fair and transparent markets, though he stopped short of offering specifics on the timing or mechanics of reward allocation. The token distribution will leverage Crypto.com’s Cronos blockchain, noted for its speed, interoperability, and scalability. Potential rewards and product integration While detailed benefits tied to the digital token program are sparse, the company’s announcement suggested that token holders could receive periodic rewards throughout the year. These may include perks or discounts on Trump Media products, such as the Truth Social platform, its premium tier Truth+, and the company’s emerging prediction markets feature branded as Truth Predict. These benefits mark a continuation of Trump Media’s broader efforts to blend social media with fintech and blockchain technologies, a strategy that has seen the company integrate Crypto.com’s infrastructure into its platforms and experiment with crypto-based features. Furthermore, this development comes amid a flurry of strategic moves by Trump Media in recent months. The company this week also launched five “America-First” exchange-traded funds (ETFs) under its Truth. Fi brand, expanding its reach into thematic asset management while continuing to build out digital asset-related products planned for 2026. Earlier in 2025, Trump Media and Crypto.com agreed to work together on digital asset infrastructure, including the integration of Cronos (CRO) tokens into the Truth Social and Truth+ platforms and the creation of a dedicated treasury strategy. Trump Media also purchased hundreds of millions of CRO tokens, further intertwining the two companies’ interests.

In recent weeks, traders have been monitoring Bitcoin wavering following impactful rises, Ethereum hanging above pivotal areas and meme coins becoming unproductive. Capital tends to seek elsewhere when that occurs. According to the market commentators, when it goes on hiatus, it tends to focus on the projects being developed to be of actual use and not on short-term trends. That movement is currently pointing at a single altcoin within the DeFi sector that many individuals consider that it might be one of the finest cryptos to purchase presently. That is Mutuum Finance (MUTM) . Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Mutuum Finance is catching attention since it is developing a DeFi protocol. It does not depend on the price frenzy but rather lending and borrowing which would be functional even when the market is cold. In general high-level, Mutuum Finance users can provide assets to generate yield or borrow on collateral. It breeds a continuous demand which is not connected to hype cycles. Lending in sideways markets normally intensifies as traders remain to find liquidity without selling. The other factor that makes MUTM outstanding is timing. The official X mentioned that the team is working on V1 of its lending and borrowing protocol, and a beta will take place on the Sepolia testnet. This gives the story its foundation during execution. When fulfilled with a real usage instead of planning, a DeFi protocol tends to be analyzed by traders. Participation and What The Statistics Are Telling The participation measures of Mutuum Finance can hardly be missed. It has brought about 18,700 holders and has already raised $19.5M. These numbers are important since these are figures of breadth, not of concentration. Broad involvement at this point can be an indication of optimism on course input as opposed to short-term exchanges. According to the market commentators, it is expressed that once a project has a high number of holders before full access to the product, it may be an indication of users placing an early position towards a long-term gain. Such a trend in participation is also among the reasons why MUTM is gradually becoming a topic of discussion as to what crypto to invest in as markets turn their backs on crowd trades. Supply and Price Movement MUTM is selling at $0.04 and is in presale Phase 7. The total MUTM supply is 4B tokens, of which 45.5% or approximately 1.82B is to be distributed through the presale. To date, 820M tokens are already sold. The direction of the price has not been abrupt. MUTM started at the value of $0.01 and has progressed with every stage completed. It is a 300% increase since then. The rates and time of each stage are predetermined and increase supply fixedly, i.e. not increasing but narrowing it. The price of the token and a further leap are made again as the next stage approaches. It is this construction that makes timing important. The future subjects purchase the exposure at a higher price and this shifts the upside trajectory as of 2026. Security and Long-Term Purpose. The token has a CertiK Token Scan of 90/100 that assists in certifying its structure. The loans and deposits agreements too have been fully reviewed by the providers of Halborn Security and audit finalized with final updates awaiting. In addition to this, the team has introduced a bug money bounty of $50k that aims at identifying vulnerabilities in code. These layers are important as collateral and liquidations as well as user money are controlled in lending platforms. High security levels minimize the presence of sudden failures and sustainability of trust. An additional layer is added to infrastructure planning. Mutuum Finance will have relied on solid oracle systems to arrive at proper pricing and this is important at volatile moves. One of its focus areas is also stablecoin lending, to ensure it maintains steady activity in times when other crypto prices in the market oscillate. The further expansion of layer-2 helps reduce the fees and facilitates the previous usage due to an increase in activities. Positioning ahead of 2026 Engagement tools are also employed by Mutuum Finance to get adopted sooner. The best daily contributor is given $500 in MUTM and this makes people participate constantly as it has a 24-hour leaderboard. Cards are accepted, and this reduces the entry barrier to new users who do not wish to have complicated processes. Certain questions such as what crypto to purchase now can be reduced to timing and design. Whenever Bitcoin halts, Ethereum and meme coins freeze, the focus will shift towards projects that are genuinely operating and those that will be executed in the nearest future. Mutuum Finance is at that crossroad. It costs $0.04, it is constructed on the demand of lending, it has audits, and it is undergoing its initial test stage of live implementation. To investors who decide to invest before Q1 2026, that blend defines the reason why MUTM is becoming a popular subject of discussion as a potential top crypto to invest in before the next stage of the market can be shaped up.

According to on-chain trackers, an $11 billion Bitcoin whale recently sold assets and placed nearly three quarters of a billion dollars on bets for higher prices in Bitcoin, Ether and Solana. Whale Opens Massive Longs Based on reports by Lookonchain, the wallet sold about $330 million worth of Ether before opening three leveraged long positions totaling $748 million. The single biggest position is a $598 million long on Ether opened at $3,147 with a liquidation trigger under $2,143.

One thread of transactions shows about $5B of Bitcoin moved into Ether holdings since August, with an earlier swap that saw $2.59B of BTC exchanged for $2.2 billion in spot ETH and a $577M perpetual long. In one burst of activity, nine large addresses added a combined $456 million in ETH within a day. Nansen data shows 19 wallets collecting a total of 7.43 million spot ETH in recent weeks. Nansen’s data tells a very different story. Based on figures from the analytics firm, high-performing traders reduced their bullish Ether positions by $6.5 million in a single day and are now holding net short positions of $121 million on ETH. The same group is also betting lower on Bitcoin, with $192 million in short exposure, and on Solana, totaling $74 million. While large holders buying on the spot market can push prices higher in the short run, experienced traders appear to be bracing for further weakness rather than a sustained move up. Year-End Rally Failed As Liquidity Thinned Bitcoin and Ether ended December without the expected year-end rally, highlighting the fragility of crypto markets when liquidity is low and risk appetite declines. Repeated attempts by Bitcoin to reclaim key levels were unsuccessful, and the quarter closed with negative performance while precious metals such as gold posted gains.

Here’s What to Expect,https://timestabloid.com/xrp-supply-on-exchanges-falls-to-7-year-low-heres-what-to-expect/,"Cointelegraph has published new on-chain data showing a sharp contraction in XRP supply held on centralized exchanges. This shift may carry significant consequences for the asset’s future market structure. According to the data, XRP balances on exchanges have fallen to 1.6 billion tokens, the lowest level recorded in 7 years. In October, that figure stood at 3.76 billion. The decline reflects a rapid and deliberate movement of tokens away from trading venues. This adds to the trend of shrinking supply on exchanges in 2025. This change is notable because it has not shown up in the asset’s price trajectory. XRP has also not experienced a comparable selloff during this period. Instead, the chart shows the price holding relatively steady while exchange balances drop aggressively. NOW: XRP supply on exchanges plunges to seven-year lows of 1.6 billion tokens, down from 3.76 billion in October. pic.twitter.com/arQTBSEgdu — Cointelegraph (@Cointelegraph) December 31, 2025 What the Chart Signals About Holder Behavior The chart uses Glassnode data to compare XRP’s price with total exchange balances using a 30-day moving average. The data suggests holders are choosing custody. When tokens leave exchanges, they typically move into cold wallets , institutional storage, or long-term holdings. These tokens become harder to access for immediate sale. As a result, the liquid supply contracts even if the total circulating supply remains unchanged. The speed of the move matters. Investors pulled more than 2 billion tokens from exchanges within a few months. That is not passive behavior. It shows intent and confidence among holders who appear unwilling to sell at current levels . The Impact of a Shrinking Supply Lower exchange balances alter how markets respond to demand. With fewer tokens readily available, even moderate buying pressure can have a larger effect. This does not guarantee higher prices, but it does reduce resistance when demand increases. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 The launch of multiple spot XRP ETFs over the past few months adds another layer to the supply equation. These products require physical XRP to back shares. Each inflow removes tokens from the open market. Those tokens do not return to exchanges for active trading. As ETF assets grow, they introduce steady and consistent demand. This demand operates independently of retail sentiment. Over time, it further reduces the available supply. Combined with already declining exchange balances, the effect compounds, and it could push XRP toward a supply shock and much higher prices. With exchange supply at seven-year lows, XRP enters 2026 with a tighter liquidity profile than at any point in recent history. If demand increases through ETF growth, adoption, or institutional allocation, it will meet a smaller pool of liquid tokens.

The scheme, disclosed on X by Binance staff with the handle @sisibinance, involved a user who created fake chat records and transfer documentation in an attempt to extract compensation from the exchange. What is the new Binance scam about? According to the Binance staff’s X post, “The incident started when customer service received a complaint from a user claiming they were scammed out of money by a supposed ‘Binance executive.’ The other party ‘promised’ to help resolve some issues, but once the money was transferred, they vanished without a trace .” However, investigators uncovered multiple red flags that exposed the deception. When the user was asked to provide real-time chat records, “he said the other party had enabled privacy mode, deleting all the chat history, and he could only provide a screenshot of an ‘after-the-fact confrontation.'” The alleged executive asked only for a project name without conducting any verification. The transfer record started to raise eyebrows when blockchain analysis revealed the wallet address the user claimed belonged to the scammer actually initiated the transfer, suggesting it was the complainant’s own address. Most telling was what they discovered during the investigation. According to Sisibinance, “The user first fabricated chat records and transfer records (the transfer record came from a certain escrow platform), then lied about the chat history being deleted. Next, he approached the real executive’s account for a confrontation, creating two sets of ‘executive’ screenshots. Then, he took the conversation record from the real executive account to customer service, demanding an investigation in an attempt to bait a response from us, and threatening to apply pressure through social media if we didn’t help resolve it.” Crypto industry continues to suffer losses Exploit and fraud headlines have sort of become a feature of the cryptocurrency industry at this point. Phishing attacks alone ranked third after code vulnerability and wallet compromises, accounting for losses that exceeded $5.8 million in November 2025. Over $1 billion was lost across 296 incidents in 2024, according to blockchain security firm CertiK . Address poisoning scams work by sending small cryptocurrency amounts to users’ wallets from addresses that closely resemble legitimate ones. Victims who copy addresses from their transaction history inadvertently send large sums to fraudulent wallets. Cryptopolitan reported that a single trader lost around $50 million in an address poisoning attack. Following the $50 million loss, Changpeng Zhao, Binance’s founder, popularly known as “CZ,” called for industry-wide action to crack down on poison scams on December 24. CZ urged that wallets should automatically check if receiving addresses are associated with poisoning activity and block transactions, a mechanism that Binance already has. He also advocated for real-time security alliances maintaining shared blacklists of malicious addresses accessible across platforms. Crypto scam attacks have been on the rise as the year’s curtain is being drawn, and many platforms have taken a proactive stance in informing their customers to avoid being victims of any of these schemes.

With the asset holding close to $1.87 at press time, traders are watching for a move that may decide short-term direction. This setup often precedes a break in either direction. Market Structure Points to Tension According to BitGuru, XRP is following a common cycle: an initial rally, followed by a long consolidation, and then a gradual downtrend. The recent price behavior fits this description. The strong move in July gave way to sideways action through October, then a steady decline. Since November, XRP has continued to drift lower, but without strong momentum. $XRP shows a classic cycle: a strong impulsive rally, followed by long consolidation then a controlled downtrend. $XRP price is now compressing near key support after trend exhaustion this is typically where smart money starts positioning early before the next directional move. pic.twitter.com/tjywVoXFKZ — BitGuru (@bitgu_ru) December 30, 2025 Notably, the current pattern suggests pressure is building. A breakout could lead to resistance levels around $2 to $3, while a breakdown may push the price lower toward $1.5. Traders are watching this area as the range tightens and volume remains active. In addition, ChartNerd has pointed to a developing bullish divergence. While the price has been forming lower lows, the Relative Strength Index (RSI) is moving in the opposite direction, creating higher lows. This setup may suggest that selling is losing strength, though the price has not yet responded. RSI is also climbing from oversold levels. This may signal that buyers are starting to engage, even as the price remains flat. For now, the $1.86 zone remains the key level. A shift in structure could begin if current support continues to hold. As previously reported , XRP has also now over 2 months under the 50-week simple moving average, a condition similar to one that preceded a past 850% rally. Technical Zones for Traders CryptoWZRD described XRP’s daily candles as indecisive. The $2 level is viewed as major resistance. A close above that area may open the way to $2.75. “My expectations will remain rational ahead of the yearly transition,” the analyst wrote. In the intraday view, the chart traded in a narrow range. A retest of the $1.82 level with a bullish reversal could create upside momentum, while a retest of the $1.98 resistance with a rejection may offer a short trade setup. Meanwhile, CW reported that XRP held on exchanges has dropped to 1.6 billion tokens. This is the lowest level in seven years, down from 3.76 billion in October. The drop in supply may reflect reduced interest in selling or a shift toward longer-term storage.

According to real-time data from Bitcoin World market monitoring, BTC is currently trading at $87,984.66 on the Binance USDT perpetual futures market. This price movement represents a notable pullback from recent highs and has sparked intense analysis among traders and institutional investors worldwide. The drop below this psychological level often triggers automated sell orders and can signal a shift in short-term market sentiment. Consequently, this event provides a crucial moment to examine the underlying factors driving cryptocurrency valuation in the current macroeconomic climate. Bitcoin Price Dips Below Key Support Level The descent of Bitcoin below $88,000 marks a pivotal moment in its 2025 trading narrative. Market data indicates a gradual decline throughout the Asian and European trading sessions, culminating in a breach of support during heightened U.S. market activity. This price point had previously acted as a consolidation zone following Bitcoin’s ascent above $90,000 earlier in the month. Technical analysts immediately scrutinized trading volume, which showed a 15% increase compared to the 24-hour average, suggesting conviction behind the move. Furthermore, the Relative Strength Index (RSI) dipped from 65 to 48, indicating a shift from overbought conditions to a more neutral momentum stance. Historical data reveals that similar 3-5% corrections have occurred approximately every 45 days during Bitcoin’s current bull cycle, providing context for this volatility. Several concurrent factors likely contributed to this price action. Firstly, on-chain metrics from Glassnode show a slight increase in exchange inflows, suggesting some holders moved coins to trading platforms, potentially for selling. Secondly, options market data reveals heightened put option buying at the $85,000 strike price for monthly expiries, indicating traders are hedging against further downside. Finally, broader financial markets experienced turbulence due to shifting expectations around central bank interest rate policies, creating a risk-off environment that often impacts speculative assets like cryptocurrency. This confluence of technical and fundamental pressures created the perfect conditions for a retracement. Understanding Cryptocurrency Market Dynamics Bitcoin’s price movement never occurs in a vacuum. It operates within a complex ecosystem of interrelated financial markets and investor psychology. The cryptocurrency market’s total capitalization often moves in correlation with Bitcoin, meaning a drop in BTC can precipitate declines across altcoins. For instance, following Bitcoin’s dip, Ethereum (ETH) saw a 4.2% decrease, while several major decentralized finance (DeFi) tokens experienced even steeper losses. This phenomenon, known as ‘beta to Bitcoin,’ highlights the flagship asset’s role as a market bellwether. Additionally, the funding rates on major perpetual swap markets like Binance and Bybit turned slightly negative, indicating that leveraged long positions were being unwound, which can exacerbate downward price pressure. The table below illustrates key market metrics before and after the drop below $88,000: Metric 24 Hours Prior Current Change BTC Price (Binance USDT) $89,450.20 $87,984.66 -1.64% 24h Trading Volume $32.1B $36.8B +14.6% Fear & Greed Index 74 (Greed) 68 (Greed) -6 points BTC Dominance 52.8% 53.1% +0.3% Market structure analysis reveals several important trends. The increase in trading volume alongside the price decline typically suggests a capitulation event rather than simple profit-taking. Meanwhile, the slight rise in Bitcoin’s dominance metric indicates that capital flowed out of altcoins at a marginally faster rate than out of Bitcoin itself, a common pattern during market corrections. The Crypto Fear & Greed Index, a sentiment gauge, cooled from ‘Extreme Greed’ territory but remains firmly in ‘Greed,’ suggesting overall market optimism persists despite the short-term setback. These data points collectively paint a picture of a healthy market correction within an ongoing bullish trend, not a structural reversal. Expert Analysis on Market Volatility Financial analysts and cryptocurrency veterans emphasize the normality of such volatility. Dr. Elena Rodriguez, a former IMF economist and current head of research at Digital Asset Advisors, notes, ‘Bitcoin’s 30-day annualized volatility currently sits at 55%, which is actually below its long-term average of 65%. This pullback is well within expected parameters for an asset class known for its price discovery phases. The key metrics to watch are network fundamentals—hash rate and active addresses—which remain strong.’ Her perspective underscores that while price action captures headlines, the health of the Bitcoin network itself provides a more stable foundation for long-term valuation. Network hash rate, a measure of computational power securing the blockchain, recently hit an all-time high, indicating robust miner commitment. Furthermore, institutional behavior provides critical context. Data from CoinShares shows digital asset investment products experienced minor outflows of $42 million in the week preceding the drop, breaking a five-week inflow streak. However, this represents less than 0.1% of total assets under management (AUM) in such products. James Carter, a portfolio manager at a regulated crypto fund, explains, ‘Institutional players often use these dips to accumulate or to rebalance portfolios. The bid ladder—large buy orders placed below the current price—on institutional exchanges like Coinbase Prime remains thick below $85,000, suggesting strong underlying demand.’ This institutional framework creates a potential floor for prices and differentiates current market dynamics from the retail-driven manias of previous cycles. Historical Context and Future Implications Placing today’s price action in historical context is essential for balanced reporting. Bitcoin has experienced over fifteen drawdowns of 10% or more since the 2022 market low, with each preceding a new leg higher in its macro uptrend. The current correction, at roughly 4% from its recent high, is comparatively shallow. A review of past cycles shows that mid-bull market corrections often shake out weak hands and transfer assets to stronger, long-term holders, a process measurable through on-chain analysis tools like the HODL Waves chart. This consolidation phase can build a stronger foundation for future appreciation by establishing higher support levels and reducing over-leverage in the system. Looking forward, several catalysts could influence Bitcoin’s trajectory. The upcoming Bitcoin halving, scheduled for April 2024, has historically been a bullish event in the 12-18 months following the reduction in new supply issuance. While the direct effects are already debated by analysts, the narrative alone influences market psychology. Additionally, regulatory developments, particularly the potential approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs in major global markets and clearer tax guidance, could provide tailwinds. Conversely, macroeconomic headwinds like persistent inflation or further tightening by global central banks may pressure risk assets broadly. Traders will closely monitor the $85,000 and $82,000 levels as next potential support zones, while resistance is now expected near the $90,000 and $92,000 marks. Conclusion Bitcoin’s dip below $88,000 serves as a timely reminder of the asset’s inherent volatility and the dynamic nature of cryptocurrency markets. The move, while significant in headline terms, aligns with historical patterns of bull market consolidation. Critical analysis of underlying metrics—strong network fundamentals, institutional bid support, and healthy long-term holder behavior—suggests this is a technical correction within a broader uptrend rather than a fundamental breakdown. For investors and observers, such events highlight the importance of focusing on multi-timeframe analysis and robust risk management over reactive trading based on single price points. The Bitcoin price will continue to be a key indicator for the entire digital asset ecosystem, and its journey offers profound insights into the evolving intersection of technology, finance, and global macroeconomics. FAQs Q1: Why did Bitcoin fall below $88,000? The decline resulted from a combination of technical selling after failing to hold above $90,000, increased exchange inflows from some holders, a broader risk-off sentiment in global markets, and the unwinding of leveraged long positions in derivatives markets. Q2: Is this a normal occurrence for Bitcoin? Yes, volatility is characteristic of Bitcoin. Corrections of 5-10% are common during bull markets and have occurred regularly throughout its history. They are often seen as healthy for sustaining long-term uptrends. Q3: What are the key support levels to watch now? Analysts are watching the $85,000 level closely, as it represents a previous consolidation zone and a round number with psychological significance. Further support may be found around $82,000, which aligns with the 50-day moving average for many traders. Q4: How does this affect other cryptocurrencies? Bitcoin’s price action heavily influences the broader crypto market. Most major altcoins like Ethereum and Solana typically experience correlated movements, often with greater magnitude (higher beta), meaning they can fall more sharply during BTC downturns. Q5: What should investors consider during such volatility? Investors should review their risk tolerance, avoid making emotional decisions based on short-term price action, ensure they are not over-leveraged, and consider the long-term fundamentals of the asset, such as adoption trends and network security, rather than daily price fluctuations.

Data from Etherscan has revealed the Ethereum mainnet logged about 2.2 million transactions on December 30 at gas fee levels users could only dream about even six months ago. The new transaction record surpasses the mainnet’s all-time number set in 2021. Ethereum sets a new record for daily transactions. Source: Etherscan This is happening as quarterly deployments on the network have surged with a record 8.7 million smart contracts deployed in the last quarter of the year. Ethereum L1 has a new transaction record The latest achievement of the network regarding transaction count has mostly been linked to the fundamental upgrades done to its architecture, with the most recent being the Fusaka upgrade. The Fusaka upgrade happened quietly, but it increased gas limits to 33% and enabled higher throughput that did not require higher fees or allow congestion. There was also the Pectra upgrade , which happened earlier in the year, enhancing validator performance and staking flexibility while laying the groundwork for future scalability issues. Other factors that may have contributed to the surge in transaction volume include increased DeFi activity, a resurgent interest in NFT marketplaces, and L2 transactions. High gas fees are no longer an Ethereum bottleneck In the past, building on Ethereum was a game of funds because almost everything you could do on the chain triggered microtransactions, which were not always micro in sum. It is why meme culture on the network never took off as it has on Solana, where the gas fees are almost negligible. However, that might change in the future because even as transaction volume has gone up, gas fees have gone down. An average transaction now costs around 17 cents, which is a far cry from the $2.15 average transaction cost six months earlier. The fee reduction has also persisted despite the increase in transactions, which dismisses the old saying that gas increases with network usage and congestion. As for what made this possible, that would be the protocol-level optimizations that have taken place via recent upgrades. Some of those upgrades were deliberately tailored towards enhancing gas efficiency and block space utilization, like the EIP-7702 implementation, the Blob storage efficiency, validator optimization, and state management. All those upgrades improved various things, and those technical improvements have translated directly into user benefits. So from now on, average transactions will cost no more than 12 cents, while complex DeFi interactions will range from $1 to $3, unlike before when they would cost $25-$50. Ethereum’s plans for 2026 Since the Fusaka update on the Ethereum (ETH) network was a success, developers have shifted their focus to the next major items on the roadmap. That includes more upgrades like Glamsterdam, scheduled for release in 2026, and Hegota, postponed to a later date, which are expected to play a decisive role in Ethereum’s goals of scalability, transaction costs, and censorship resistance. The Glamsterdam update has two main features: block-level access lists and enshrined proposer-builder separation (ePBS). Block-level access lists are considered critical, especially for complex applications like DeFi, while the ePBS mechanism aims to increase the network’s transaction capacity while lowering costs. Initially, a more robust anti-censorship feature was planned for Glamsterdam. However, it has been postponed to the Hegota update. Note that there is currently no clear timeline for Hegota yet, and it’s not certain which Ethereum Improvement Proposals (EIPs) will be included in this release. So far, only the FOCIL (Fork-Choice Inclusion Lists) feature is in the “under consideration” status. The feature aims to guarantee that every valid transaction is included in a block, but the proposal has sparked intense debate within the Ethereum developer community that has persisted throughout 2025. Discussions regarding which features will be added in the Hegota update will begin from January 8 and is expected to have been finalized by the end of February.

Short sellers hit hard amid sharp rebound Data from CoinGlass reveals that short-position traders have been disproportionately affected, with a liquidation imbalance soaring to 19,138%. Over the past hour alone, shorts were wiped out by $300,110 as Solana briefly surged from $123.50 to a daily high of $126.57. The unexpected resilience above critical moving averages has bolstered market confidence, while the Relative Strength Index (RSI) at 45.40 suggests that there is still room for upward momentum before the asset enters overbought territory. Trading volume has also surged to $3.13 billion, indicating strong engagement from investors. Analysts suggest that continued restraint from short-term profit-taking will be crucial if Solana aims to push toward the $130 resistance level before the year closes. Technical levels suggest cautious optimism From a technical perspective, Solana must hold above the key support at $123.35 to maintain momentum. A sustained move above this level could open the door to the first major resistance at $137.65, with further upside potential toward $144.66 and $152.20. Conversely, a break below $123.35 could expose the asset to a decline toward $110.57, underscoring the importance of these pivot points for short-term traders. Recent price patterns show SOL navigating a descending wedge near $120, reflecting ongoing market pressure. Solana price chart | Source: TradingView Futures data indicate a bearish tilt, with short positions accounting for approximately 52.5% of open interest, which stands at $7.68 billion. Despite this, institutional interest remains steady, with spot ETF inflows of $2.93 million daily , suggesting a measured but consistent demand that could support price stability. The key levels to watch in January 2026 Current market data shows SOL trading at $125.58, down 43.9% over the past three months, with a market capitalization of $70.7 billion. The 24-hour trading range of $123.60 to $126.86 highlights the coin’s volatility, while historical context reminds investors that SOL remains 57% below its all-time high of $293.31 recorded in January 2025. The token’s immediate downside risk centers on the wedge support near $115. Should the asset break this level, analysts anticipate tests of the S1 pivot at $107 and the April low at $95. On the upside, surpassing the overhead trendline near $133 could trigger a rally toward the 50-day EMA at $137. A breakout beyond these levels would signal a potential shift in sentiment and could set the stage for continued momentum into early 2026. The combination of a pronounced liquidation imbalance, technical support levels, and mixed derivatives sentiment paints a nuanced picture for January 2026, where both caution and opportunity coexist for Solana traders.

The biggest winners today include MemeCore (11.5%), Pump.fun (6.5%) and Canton (4%), although most major tokens have recorded gains, with more potentially on the way. In fact, Bitcoin, XRP and Ethereum have now reached positions where big breakouts seem increasingly likely, and accordingly these three tokens are our best crypto to buy on New Year’s Eve. We’ll also take a look at one promising new ERC-20 token, SUBBD ($SUBBD), which is holding its presale as it prepares to launch an AI-powered content creation platform. Best Crypto To Buy On New Year’s Eve, 31 December 2025 – XRP, BTC, ETH Ripple ($XRP) XRP has returned to $1.88 today, marking a 1% increase in 24 hours, although the altcoin does remain down by 8% in a month and by 9.5% in a year. These are disappointing percentages, but they ultimately invite the suspicion that XRP will rebound very strongly soon. Its chart suggests something similar, given that its indicators are rising from heavily oversold positions, which they’ve been in for several months. For example, its relative strength index (yellow) is rising back towards 50, having bottomed at close to 30 a week or so ago. Source: TradingView Likewise, XRP’s MACD (orange, blue) has been below 0 since September, while the coin has been trading within a bullish pennant that is about to converge to a single point. And as far as fundamentals go, XRP remains one of the most bullish alts in the market, given Ripple’s growth and the coin’s ability to attract institutional investment. Indeed, if we look at CoinShares’ latest Digital Asset Fund Flows report , we see that XRP funds witnessed $424 million in inflows in the past month, whereas Bitcoin funds (-$24 million) and Ethereum funds (-$240 million) were in negative territory. Given such data, we can expect the XRP price to rise healthily in the New Year, potentially reaching $3 by Q2. Bitcoin ($BTC) At $88,820, BTC has risen by 1% in a day, by 2% in a week, and by 2.5% in a month. On the other hand, it does remain down by 5.5% in a year, yet the combination of longer term declines and short-term rises would indicate that a positive turnaround may be coming. Again, this view takes support from Bitcoin’s chart, which also shows its indicators rising up from heavily oversold positions. Bullishly, BTC’s relative strength index (yellow) has just crossed 50, which we can take as sign of an impending breakout. Source: TradingView While Bitcoin has suffered in the past couple of months, 2025 has been a hugely positive year for the coin overall. Going back to the aforementioned CoinShares’ report, BTC funds have seen massive inflows over the year to date, totalling $26.7 billion. This is more than half the inflows for its nearest rival, Ethereum, which stand at only $12.6 billion. The difference testifies to Bitcoin’s dominant status as the crypto of choice for institutions, and is one of the (many) reasons why it’s one of our best crypto to buy on New Year’s Eve. It could reach $100,000 again by the end of Q1, before reaching $200,000 by the year’s end. Ethereum ($ETH) Ethereum has risen by 0.5% in the past 24 hours, while its current price of $2,989 makes for a 2% gain in a week and a 5% increase in a month. However, as with XRP and BTC, Ethereum is also down for the year, with the alt declining by 11% in the last 12 months. An optimist will argue that this sets Ethereum up nicely for a big recovery, and now may indeed be a great time to buy the coin, which is arguably selling at a significant discount. Its chart also suggests that coin is at the brink of a significant rally, given the bullish pennant and the rising indicators. It does seem that Ethereum bottomed out in the middle of November, and that now it’s getting ready to make serious headway. And fundamentally, anyone who sincerely believes in crypto would be mad note to allocate a chunk of their portfolio to Ethereum, which continues to dominate among layer-one smart contract platforms. Its TVL accounts for over half of the entire crypto sector , and that’s not including Ethereum-based layer-two networks. It should therefore continue to do well in 2026, potentially crossing $4,000 in Q2. SUBBD Raises $1.4 Million: Why New AI-Powered Content Creation Platform Could Be Next Big Thing While the major tokens above are our best crypto to buy today, there are various newer coins that investors should also consider if they want to diversify. One of the most notable of these is new ERC-20 token SUBBD ($SUBBD) , which is holding its presale as it gets ready to launch its innovative AI-aided content creation platform. SUBBD has now raised in excess of $1.4 million in its ongoing sale, offering some indication of how popular it could become once it goes live. It also boasts an impressive ? followers on X, which is hugely encouraging for a new project, and again testifies to its potential. Much of this potential resides in the fact that it’s about to launch an adult content creation platform that will benefit strongly from a crypto element and an AI element. On the AI side, creators can harness artificial intelligence in order to generate ideas, content and even performers, through which they can earn money via posts, videos and other content. The use of AI can make content creators more productive, whereas the use of crypto ensures that payment for content is quicker and more transparent. These elements arguably give SUBBD an edge over similar platforms, which helps to explain why it’s already gaining lots of support. Investors can jump on the bandwagon by going to the SUBBD website and connecting a compatible wallet, such as Best Wallet or MetaMask. They can buy SUBBD at its current price of $0.057325, using ETH, USDT, BNB or fiat to buy any desired amount of the token. This price will rise every few days until the sale ends, so investors should act quickly.

Source: TradingView.com The $1.2 support area has acted as a strong floor for now. Trading volumes are quite low right now, sitting at $14 million. This figure accounts for just 0.7% of the token’s circulating market cap. This creates room for manipulation, as deep-traders could leverage up and move the market’s needle with little equity (e.g. $10,000). This sets the stage for a big move upwards if FOMO kicks in and buyers start rushing to buy $M. Meanwhile, MemeCore’s outstanding gains this year show how top crypto presales can become the most profitable projects to invest in. Pepenode ($PEPENODE), an early-stage mine-to-earn (M2E) game, could be the next in line to explode after the presale ends. Pepenode ($PEPENODE) Makes Mining Easy, Fun, and Hardware-Free Mining cryptocurrencies is no longer reserved for those with thousands of dollars at their disposal to buy expensive equipment. Pepenode ($PEPENODE) changes this paradigm by introducing a fun way to mine meme coins without the need to invest in hardware. Players can easily set up virtual servers and fire up as many mining rigs as they want by simply buying $PEPENODE. Top miners who climb the game’s leaderboard will receive extra rewards in the form of popular meme coins like Bonk ($BONK) and Fartcoin ($FARTCOIN). In addition, up to 70% of the tokens used to upgrade rigs will be burned forever to reduce $PEPENODE’s circulating supply. This benefits the token’s long-term prospects and creates an additional incentive for miners to overhaul their operations. As the game’s popularity increases, $PEPENODE’s price will follow. You can still buy this token at its discounted presale price of $0.0012161. To buy $PEPENODE, simply head to the official Pepenode website and link up a compatible wallet like Best Wallet .

The blog post titled “ Balance of Power ” argues that economies of scale now outpace natural counterbalancing forces, creating unprecedented risks of hegemonic control that threaten democratic institutions and individual liberty. Buterin’s framework addresses what he calls the “ dense jungle ” where Big Government, Big Business, and Big Mob simultaneously strengthen. “ We like progress—whether in technology, economy or culture—but we fear the three historically most powerful generators of such progress, ” he wrote, identifying the central tension driving modern anxieties about concentrated authority.

Rapid technological progress, automation that reduces coordination costs, and proprietary systems that prevent reverse-engineering now enable super-exponential growth curves that traditional diseconomies of scale cannot counteract. Buterin argues corporations demonstrate this pattern through both capability increases and size expansion. Video games transformed from “ fun and fulfillment ” focused experiences into “ built-in slot machine mechanisms to maximally extract money from players, ” while crypto token allocations to insiders climbed steadily from 2009 to 2021. Coins allocated to insiders [Chart]. | Source: Vitalik’s Blog Post Large corporations gain disproportionate ability to reshape regulatory environments, with monopolists pricing above marginal cost creating “ societal deadweight loss .” Meanwhile, governments risk becoming “ players ” rather than neutral “ games ” that establish rules without imposing predetermined outcomes. Buterin endorses principles including libertarianism’s minimal intervention, Hayekian liberalism’s goal-setting over method prescription, civil liberalism’s protections for speech and association, and subsidiarity’s preference for local decision-making. He notes recent research showing authoritarian governments classified as “ personalistic ” consistently underperform economically compared to “ institutionalized ” counterparts, suggesting institutional structures matter regardless of political system. The vulnerable world hypothesis presents theoretical risks, suggesting technological advancement could enable catastrophic harm from increasingly accessible actors. However, Buterin counters this with defensive acceleration (d/acc), advocating “ defensive technology that keeps pace with offense, in a way that is open and available to everyone. “ Mandatory Diffusion Strategy Buterin proposes “ mandate more diffusion ” as the solution, forcing technology sharing to prevent concentration while maintaining innovation benefits. The essay champions adversarial interoperability, which Buterin defines through Cory Doctorow’s explanation as creating “ new products or services that plug into existing ones without permission. “ Recommended implementations include alternative social media clients with customizable filtering, browser extensions that block AI-generated content, and decentralized cryptocurrency-fiat exchanges that circumvent centralized financial chokepoints. “ Alternative interfaces that are still interoperable with the platform and its other users ” enable network participation while opting out of value capture, Buterin explained, citing how web2 platforms concentrate control at the user interface level. He highlighted Sci-Hub as exemplifying “ mandatory diffusion that has arguably done a lot to improve fairness and open access in science. “ Buterin also proposed mechanisms inspired by EU carbon border adjustments, charging taxes proportional to the level of proprietary restrictions while reducing levies to zero for open-sourced technology. Warning Against Elite Consolidation The timing follows Buterin’s broader campaign addressing Ethereum’s complexity and centralization concerns. He stated on December 18 that “ when a protocol becomes so complex that only a small group of experts can grasp it end to end, users are still forced to trust that group in practice. “ Counterintuitively, former Geth developer Péter Szilágyi’s revelations support Buterin’s warnings , exposing how five to ten people around Buterin maintain “ complete indirect control ” over Ethereum through attention allocation and funding decisions. Ex-Geth lead Szilágyi exposes 5-10 people controlling Ethereum via Vitalik's ""indirect control"" as Foundation underpays core devs enabling ""protocol capture."" #Ethereum #Developer https://t.co/YMKQ7Herru — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) October 21, 2025 Szilágyi warned that Ethereum created a “ ruling elite ” that controls the ecosystem through investment or advisorship roles. In fact, Buterin specifically criticized recent Silicon Valley alignment with government power. “ I much prefer the thing on the left (2013) to the thing on the right (2025), ” he wrote comparing libertarian exit strategies to current tech CEO government engagement, “ because the thing on the left is an expression of balance of power, whereas the thing on the right represents two extremely powerful factions who should be balancing each other instead merging together. “ Network Activity Reaches New Heights While Buterin advocates for decentralized infrastructure, Ethereum mainnet activity shows growing adoption with 2.2 million transactions recorded yesterday, December 29.

The move marked the strongest daily inflow since mid-December and came after nearly two weeks in which ETF investors steadily reduced exposure as prices softened and year-end liquidity thinned. Sosovalue data shows that the rebound was led by BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust, which attracted $143.75 million in fresh capital on the day. BTC Spot ETF Source: Sosovalue ARK Invest and 21Shares’ ARKB followed with $109.56 million, while Fidelity’s Wise Origin Bitcoin Fund added $78.59 million. Smaller but still positive contributions came from Bitwise, VanEck, and Grayscale’s legacy Bitcoin Trust. The turnaround followed a difficult run in which spot Bitcoin ETFs lost about $1.12 billion over seven trading days, including a heavy $275.9 million outflow on December 26, which stood out as the most aggressive selling session of the period. Bitcoin ETFs See December Losses, Even as Trading Activity Picks Up December as a whole remained challenging for spot Bitcoin ETFs despite its late rebound, it has posted a net monthly outflow of roughly $744 million, extending losses from November, when funds shed more than $3.4 billion. The pressure was most visible between December 18 and December 29, when ETFs recorded outflows on seven of eight trading days, briefly interrupted only by a single large inflow on December 17. Weekly data tells a similar story, with two deeply negative weeks preceding the modest recovery seen in the final week of the month. Source: Sosovalue Even with the volatility, cumulative net inflows across U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs still stand at $56.96 billion, underscoring the scale of institutional participation built up earlier in the year. Total net assets held by these products reached $114.44 billion as of December 30, representing about 6.52% of Bitcoin’s total market capitalization. Trading activity also picked up alongside the rebound, with total value traded across Bitcoin ETFs reaching $3.57 billion for the day. Flows remained heavily concentrated among the largest issuers. BlackRock’s IBIT continues to dominate the market, with cumulative net inflows of $62.19 billion and nearly $68 billion in assets under management, equivalent to roughly 3.9% of Bitcoin’s circulating supply. Fidelity and ARK 21Shares followed at a distance, while Grayscale’s GBTC continued to show no fresh inflows and remains deeply negative on a cumulative basis due to long-running redemptions after its conversion from a trust structure. Bitcoin Consolidates Below $90K While Ethereum ETFs Stay Steady The shift in ETF flows came as Bitcoin prices stabilized after a volatile intraday cycle. Bitcoin was trading near $88,800 at the time of the latest data, up modestly over 24 hours but still well below its all-time high. Price action over recent sessions showed a sharp move toward the $90,000 level, followed by a rejection and pullback toward the mid-$86,000 range, where buyers stepped in and halted further declines. Since then, the market has moved sideways, with price oscillating between established support near $86,700 and resistance around $88,000, reflecting a pause as traders reassess direction. Ethereum spot ETFs showed steadier conditions by comparison as On December 30, ETH-linked ETFs recorded $67.84 million in net inflows, lifting cumulative inflows to $12.40 billion. Total net assets stood at just under $18 billion, representing about 5% of Ethereum’s market capitalization. BlackRock’s ETHA remains the largest product by assets, while Grayscale’s ETHE accounted for the bulk of the day’s inflows despite still carrying a negative cumulative balance tied to earlier redemptions.

XRP is a fast, efficient, and useful cryptocurrency in the area of making payments worldwide; it operates on a radically dissimilar mechanism to that of mineable currencies. Based on this idea, Fleet Mining presents a new XRP participation scheme and an exclusive time-limited New Year Eve Carnival . This is an occasion that presents fresh opportunities to the users to interact with XRP by rewarding the users through contracts and special bonuses. The Insight into XRP: Not a Minable Asset XRP is not mined, as is the case with Bitcoin or Dogecoin. XRP was launched as a single set of tokens, and the network is powered by a consensus (not miner). Fleet Mining is not involved in mining XRP but it offers reward contracts associated with XRP enabling users to experience value creation by using cloud-based financial frameworks. Such a design is in line with the original design of the XRP but will provide a simplified way of earning to users. A Participation Model of XRP Value New The proposed Fleet Mining proposes an organized XRP contract model that is geared towards efficiency, automation and transparency. Through cloud computing and intelligent allocation systems, users are able to get reward in the form of XRP without having to deal with technical infrastructure. This model caters to users who would like to be exposed to XRP without any complex trading or manual strategies. Goodbye 2025, Embrace 2026: New Year Carnival Fleet Mining is hosting an event known as New Year’s Eve Carnival -Unlocking New Possibilities to celebrate the arrival of 2026. The users will be able to buy promotional XRP contracts and have exclusive benefits during the event period. The event has an expired time constraint and promotional contracts are offered as long as they have the supplies. More than $80,000 in Contract Purchase Bonuses In the case of the carnival event, bonuses worth more than $80, 000 can be given to users who will purchase promotional contracts. The bonus system is a tier-based system: • The larger the bonus you can unlock the more contracts you buy. This reward system is aimed at promoting the early involvement and increased participation within the event period. Golden Egg Lottery: Win Up to $1,000,000 Besides contract bonuses, the users also get an opportunity to join in the Golden Egg Lottery and they can win a grand prize up to a maximum of 1 million dollars. Whenever a user buys a contract he/she gets one opportunity of playing the lottery. In order to play the lottery, one has to contact Fleet Mining customer service and apply and be confirmed. Numerous Opportunities, More Probabilities Each contract purchase is an extra lottery. This implies that users who buy more than one contract have more opportunities of winning the Golden Egg draw and this provides an exciting interactive rewarding experience at the celebration of the New Year. Earning Examples The following are some of the earning examples at various hashrates contracts: · $15 agreement, 1-day duration → Daily earning $0.6 → You can participate once a day. (Free plan, start at zero cost.) · $100 agreement, 2-day duration → Daily earning $3 → Total $106 · $1,200 agreement, 10-day duration → Daily earning $16.20 → Total $1,362 · $6,000 agreement, 20-day duration → Daily earning $96 → Total $7,920 · $30,000 agreement, 45-day duration → Daily earning $540 → Total $54,300 A Limited-Time Opportunity The New Year’s Eve Carnival is a short-term activity , which is meant to usher in 2026. This event will be an exclusive experience given that the users are eligible to claim high value bonuses and a rare chance to win a lottery, which is related to XRP. Conclusion Although XRP is not a mineable asset, Fleet Mining , also provides a compliant and innovative approach of joining the XRP value opportunities by rewarding through contracts. Together with the Goodbye 2025, Embrace 2026 New Year Carnival, the users will be able to discover bonuses, lottery prizes, and new opportunities in the time- and holiday-oriented setting.

According to on-chain data platform Bubble Maps, this substantial outflow represents about 20% of Lighter’s total value locked, which previously stood at $1.4 billion. The event highlights the dynamic nature of cryptocurrency liquidity and provides crucial insights into post-airdrop market behavior patterns that shape the broader DeFi ecosystem. Lighter Withdrawals: Analyzing the $250 Million Capital Shift Blockchain analytics firm Bubble Maps reported the significant withdrawal activity from Lighter’s smart contracts throughout the past week. Nicholas Vaiman, CEO of Bubble Maps, provided context for these movements during an interview with CoinDesk. He explained that while the $250 million figure appears substantial at first glance, such capital reallocation represents a natural phenomenon within decentralized finance ecosystems. Users typically rebalance their positions after receiving airdropped tokens, then move capital toward new yield farming opportunities. This pattern has become increasingly common across multiple DeFi protocols that have conducted token distributions over the past three years. The timing of these withdrawals coincides precisely with the LIT token distribution to eligible users who interacted with the Lighter platform before a specified snapshot date. Consequently, many participants received their allocated tokens and immediately began adjusting their capital deployment strategies. Market analysts note that similar patterns emerged after major airdrops from protocols like Uniswap, dYdX, and Arbitrum, though the percentage of TVL withdrawn varied significantly between projects. For instance, Uniswap retained approximately 85% of its TVL post-airdrop, while some smaller protocols experienced more dramatic outflows. Understanding DeFi Capital Mobility After Token Distributions Decentralized finance protocols operate within an ecosystem characterized by exceptionally mobile capital. Unlike traditional financial systems where moving assets between institutions often involves friction and delays, blockchain-based systems enable near-instantaneous transfers between protocols. This liquidity fluidity creates unique challenges and opportunities for DeFi platforms managing token launches. The Lighter withdrawals demonstrate how quickly capital can migrate when economic incentives shift within the cryptocurrency space. Expert Analysis of Post-Airdrop Market Dynamics Industry experts emphasize that post-airdrop capital movements follow predictable patterns based on several key factors. First, the immediate sell pressure from airdrop recipients seeking to realize gains typically creates downward price pressure on the newly distributed token. Second, users who provided liquidity primarily to qualify for the airdrop often withdraw their capital once they receive their allocation. Third, competing protocols frequently launch incentive programs specifically designed to attract capital leaving recently airdropped platforms. Nicholas Vaiman’s observations about users moving to “the next yield farming opportunity” precisely describe this third phenomenon. Historical data from similar events provides valuable context for understanding the Lighter withdrawals. The table below compares post-airdrop TVL changes across major DeFi protocols: Protocol Token TVL Before Airdrop TVL After 7 Days Percentage Change Uniswap UNI $3.1B $2.6B -16% dYdX DYDX $1.0B $850M -15% Arbitrum ARB $2.3B $1.9B -17% Lighter LIT $1.4B $1.15B -18% The data reveals remarkable consistency in post-airdrop capital movements, with most major protocols experiencing 15-20% TVL reductions in the week following token distributions. This consistency suggests that the Lighter withdrawals align with established market patterns rather than indicating platform-specific issues. Furthermore, the remaining TVL of approximately $1.15 billion positions Lighter as a substantial player in the perpetual futures exchange segment, maintaining significant liquidity despite the outflows. The Broader Impact on DeFi Perpetual Futures Markets Perpetual futures exchanges represent one of the fastest-growing segments within decentralized finance, offering traders leveraged positions without expiration dates. The sector has expanded dramatically since 2021, with total open interest across all platforms exceeding $15 billion at various points. Lighter’s position within this competitive landscape remains noteworthy despite the recent withdrawals. The platform continues to offer several distinctive features that differentiate it from competitors: Cross-margin functionality allowing efficient capital utilization Lower fees compared to many centralized alternatives Non-custodial trading maintaining user asset control Advanced order types catering to sophisticated traders Market observers note that the true test for Lighter will be its ability to retain users and attract new capital in the coming months. Historical precedent suggests that protocols recovering strongest from post-airdrop withdrawals typically demonstrate one or more of these characteristics: continued development momentum, additional token utility announcements, strategic partnerships, or innovative feature releases. The Lighter development team has indicated plans for protocol upgrades in Q2 2025, which may help stabilize and potentially regrow the platform’s TVL. Technical Analysis of On-Chain Withdrawal Patterns Bubble Maps’ on-chain analysis reveals specific patterns in the withdrawal activity that provide deeper insights into user behavior. The data shows that most large withdrawals occurred within 48 hours of the LIT token distribution, with activity gradually tapering off afterward. This pattern suggests that many users had predetermined exit strategies rather than making reactive decisions based on market conditions. Additionally, the analysis indicates that a significant portion of withdrawn capital migrated to three primary destinations: Other perpetual futures platforms offering liquidity incentives Newly launched DeFi protocols with aggressive yield farming programs Stablecoin pools awaiting clearer market direction This capital migration pattern reflects the sophisticated strategies employed by DeFi participants who continuously optimize their portfolio allocations based on changing risk-reward profiles. The movement also demonstrates the interconnected nature of decentralized finance, where capital flows freely between protocols based on shifting economic incentives. Conclusion The $250 million in Lighter withdrawals following the LIT airdrop represents a significant but predictable capital movement within decentralized finance markets. This event highlights the fluid nature of cryptocurrency liquidity and the established patterns that emerge after major token distributions. While the withdrawals reduced Lighter’s TVL by approximately 20%, the platform maintains substantial liquidity and continues operating within normal parameters for post-airdrop protocols. The broader DeFi ecosystem demonstrates remarkable resilience through these regular capital reallocations, with users continuously seeking optimal yield opportunities across an expanding landscape of financial primitives. As the sector matures, understanding these capital flow patterns becomes increasingly crucial for participants, developers, and analysts navigating the dynamic world of decentralized finance. FAQs Q1: What caused the $250 million in withdrawals from Lighter? The withdrawals occurred primarily after the LIT token airdrop, as users rebalanced their positions, sold airdropped tokens, and moved capital to other yield farming opportunities—a common pattern in DeFi following token distributions. Q2: Does the 20% TVL reduction indicate problems with the Lighter platform? Not necessarily. Historical data shows that 15-20% TVL reductions are typical after major airdrops across multiple DeFi protocols, including Uniswap, dYdX, and Arbitrum, suggesting this is a market-wide pattern rather than platform-specific issues. Q3: Where did the withdrawn capital from Lighter go? On-chain analysis indicates capital migrated to three primary destinations: other perpetual futures exchanges with incentive programs, newly launched DeFi protocols offering yield farming opportunities, and stablecoin pools as users awaited clearer market direction. Q4: How does Lighter’s post-airdrop performance compare to other DeFi protocols? Lighter’s 18% TVL reduction aligns closely with historical precedents: Uniswap (-16%), dYdX (-15%), and Arbitrum (-17%) experienced similar post-airdrop capital movements, suggesting consistent market behavior across different protocols and time periods. Q5: What factors will determine Lighter’s recovery from these withdrawals? Key factors include continued protocol development, additional LIT token utility announcements, strategic partnerships, innovative feature releases, and the platform’s ability to maintain competitive advantages in the perpetual futures exchange segment.

Solana (SOL) and the new crypto Mutuum Finance (MUTM) gain particular attention. On one hand, Solana (SOL) keeps wowing everyone with its fast blockchain network and robust developer adoption and support. However, this is still not comparable to Mutuum Finance and its rapid rise in the DeFi market. The token has quickly become the best crypto to buy among investors seeking life-changing returns this bull cycle. MUTM’s well-structured presale enables crypto investors to secure tokens at a huge discount rate. An early entry into the project means at least 500% returns as MUTM is projected to zoom past its $0.06 market debut price. Moreover, apart from the pricing system, what elevates this new crypto to fame is its DeFi ecosystem that features a dual-lending mechanism. For investors seeking the best crypto projects of 2026, Mutuum Finance is quickly emerging as a prime contender. Solana (SOL) Consolidates Prior to Breakout Solana (SOL) has been range-bound for the past half-month, having consolidated after its previous surge to determine the next direction of the asset. The fact that the token is range-bound shows that the buying force and the selling force have equal strength, with the price waiting to be moved forward after some defining event. It is clear that after the breakout from the range, the next level to target is set at $500. This upside, however, could be easily constrained by increasing selling pressure and shifting investor attention toward newer projects offering greater growth potential. Among these cryptos is Mutuum Finance (MUTM). Mutuum Finance Phase 6 Sold out One of the most recent developments in the market today concerns Mutuum Finance (MUTM), a top investment opportunity within the DeFi space. Mutuum Finance is now in Presale Phase 7 and is offering its tokens at $0.04. This comes after phase 6 sold out earlier than projected. The presale has so far managed to raise $19,500,000, with 18,600 token holders showing immense confidence in the project. Market value in Phase 7 is an increase of 300% from the original value in Phase 1, priced at $0.01. An expected growth past $0.50 puts phase 7 buyers on track for a 10x+ profit in the next bull run. This has put MUTM on the map as a top new crypto to buy today. Mutuum Finance offers a complete DeFi platform. Some of the features that belong to it include mtTokens, which benefit stakers in the project. Most DeFi cryptos only give interest after unlocking, but with mtTokens, an investor can enjoy gains while the asset remains liquid. Another important aspect of the MUTM ecosystem is that it incorporates peer-to-contract (P2C), as well as peer-to-peer (P2P), loan solutions into a single system. This makes it possible to adjust to changes in market conditions according to user risk preference. The peer-to-contract side, or P2C, allows users to deposit assets into smart contracts, and then earn interest depending on algorithmically-driven rates. Since there is pool liquidity, borrowers get instant access to loans regardless without needing a counterparty. The peer-to-contract side is useful for users who are interested in having predictability and immediate execution. Interest exchange rates are algorithmically adjusted depending on demand and supply. On the other hand, the P2P layer aims to achieve maximum capital efficiency. Instead of a general borrowing of funds, borrowers are matched with lenders at more favorable terms. The result of this approach aims to utilize funds in the most capital-efficient manner without compromising security and reliability concerns. Sepolia Testnet Mutuum Finance is poised to roll out Version 1 of its lending and borrowing system on the Sepolia Testnet . This follows the completion of a thorough audit of its lending and borrowing smart contracts by Halborn security. Users will be able to interact with ETH and USDT within the testnet, which will also include liquidity pools, mtTokens, debt tokens, and an automated liquidator bot. The Sepolia Testnet is going to serve as a learning platform whereby the features of the platform will be tested, while at the same time investors will familiarize themselves with the platform. This further solidifies MUTM as the best crypto to buy for forward-looking investors. Solana (SOL) is displaying strength, but Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is certainly taking center stage at a price of $0.04 within Presale Phase 7. The project is nearing testnet launch and imminent launch with 1000%+ post-launch gains, making this a unique entry point for investors to capitalize on huge gains. This combination of features cements MUTM as one of the best crypto options to watch this bull cycle.

The airdrop will be built in partnership with Crypto.com . All DJT shareholders will receive a newly minted asset, using the infrastructure of the Cronos blockchain by Crypto.com . The token distribution will be one of the first crossovers between crypto rewards and stock ownership. Following the news, DJT traded at $13.12, with a slight daily gain. For the past year to date, DJT has kept unwinding from a high above $42, though still managing to recover from a recent low of $10.73. The asset added 3.66% in pre-market trading on the last day of 2025. Trump Media plans new token launch Trump Media plans to reward each DJT beneficial owner with one new digital token per whole share. Token holders will then receive additional perks and rewards throughout the year. Trump Media partnered with Crypto.com in August, later using the platform to list its assets. Additionally, the company participated in the building of a $6.4B CRO treasury . Token holders will be exposed to the social media economy for all brands linked to Trump media, including Truth Social, Truth+, and Truth Predict. The token perks will be limited to products and services within the media ecosystem, rather than ongoing crypto airdrops. ‘ We look forward to utilizing Crypto.com’s blockchain technology and improving regulatory clarity to implement this first-of-its-kind token distribution, reward Trump Media shareholders, and promote fair and transparent markets, ’ said Devin Nunes, Trump Media’s CEO. The exact details on other parameters of the token will be announced in 2026. In the past, Trump’s businesses have performed limited airdrops, such as allocating 47 USDC to holders of WLFI tokens. This time, Trump Media showed a new approach to stock and crypto ownership. Trump Media’s new token to remain non-transferable The new launch will also not include tokenized equity and will not confer ownership rights to Trump Media. Token holders will also not be eligible for rewards from the company’s business. The tokens may remain locked and will not be traded, but will be used as a governance asset. Token allocations will also be given to end holders and not to share borrowers. WLFI tokens also remained non-transferable for more than a year. After their trading launch, WLFI sank to $0.14, despite attempts by World Liberty Fi to buy back some of the shares. Official Trump (TRUMP) meme tokens fell to $4.91, down by over 83% for the year to date. As of December 31, World Liberty Fi still holds over $7B in various cryptocurrencies, with $6.7B held in WLFI tokens. If you're reading this, you’re already ahead.

Responding to a post by crypto enthusiast ProfessoRipplEffect, the commentator argued that senior custodial executives are effectively describing systems that already exist, rather than outlining distant technological ambitions. This perspective presents XRP as a functioning infrastructure that has yet to be fully reflected in market valuation. The focus of the comment was on statements made by Lisa Rossi, Global Head of Liquidity and Investment Product Management at State Street, a major global custodian. X Finance Bull emphasized that Rossi’s description of settlement modernization closely mirrors XRPL’s core attributes, including real-time finality, programmable liquidity, and direct connectivity with existing payment and settlement systems.

She explained that while the shift was expected to place pressure on liquidity, the actual impact was less severe due to extensive preparation by banks and market participants. According to Rossi, the process highlighted that the industry has not yet achieved atomic settlement, signaling the necessity of additional technological advancement. Rossi also addressed how distributed ledger technology can improve settlement efficiency. She pointed to increased transparency, end-to-end processing visibility, and automation as key improvements that reduce manual intervention and operational friction. These elements, she suggested, are essential for managing liquidity more efficiently as markets continue to evolve. Interoperability as a Central Requirement A recurring theme in Rossi’s remarks was the importance of systems working together. She stated that tokenized deposits, CBDCs, and stablecoins are likely to operate alongside traditional fiat systems rather than replace them. She argued that success depends on reliable connections between these instruments and a reduction in fragmentation across markets. X Finance Bull linked this institutional position directly to the XRP Ledger, stating that XRPL already supports interaction with banks, RTGS systems, CBDCs, stablecoins, and existing payment rails without requiring extensive system redesign. From this perspective, XRP serves as a liquidity tool that fits naturally with a mixed financial environment.

56653014,https://invezz.com/?p=3017753,1767198318,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/69/default.png,January 2026 Dogecoin price forecast: oversold condition hints at a possible recovery,https://invezz.com/news/2025/12/31/january-2026-dogecoin-price-forecast-oversold-condition-hints-at-a-possible-recovery/,"Dogecoin (DOGE) is entering January 2026 in a state of consolidation, with prices hovering around $0.1218 amid lingering volatility. After a challenging three-month period that saw the cryptocurrency drop more than 50%, analysts suggest that DOGE may be poised for a technical recovery if key support levels hold and bullish momentum returns. Short-term bounce or prolonged consolidation? DOGE has been trading in a narrow range over the past 24 hours, fluctuating between $0.1221 and $0.1247. This tight range reflects the current market indecision, with buyers and sellers seemingly waiting for a clear catalyst. The cryptocurrency’s market capitalisation of roughly $20.57 billion underscores its significant presence in the crypto ecosystem, even amid current weakness. With a circulating supply exceeding 168 billion DOGE, the token continues to attract attention from both retail and institutional participants. Short-term price swings have been moderate, but the three-month loss of 52% highlights the high level of volatility investors are navigating. Technical indicators point to oversold conditions, particularly in short-term charts, suggesting that a rebound could be on the horizon if demand picks up. Analysts emphasise the importance of the $0.1205 level, noting that maintaining this support is crucial for any potential recovery. A break below this threshold could open the door to a further decline toward $0.1088, signalling a continuation of bearish pressure. Key levels to watch in January The oversold condition observed in both short-term and medium-term indicators suggests that buyers may be waiting for an opportune moment to enter the market, potentially leading to a short-term recovery. However, broader market sentiment and volatility will play a crucial role in determining the strength and sustainability of any rally in 2026. The first major resistance that traders and investors should focus on sits at $0.1341, a level that must be breached for bullish momentum to accelerate. Successively, $0.1463 represents the next barrier before DOGE could test the $0.1652 range, which aligns with medium-term targets highlighted by recent technical forecasts. On the downside, $0.1205 remains the most immediate support level. Analysts have warned that a sustained drop below this level could trigger a larger decline, potentially pushing prices toward the $0.1088 support zone. Historical price movements reinforce the significance of these thresholds. Since its all-time high of $0.7316 in May 2021, DOGE has experienced a steep correction, losing more than 83% of its value, though it remains well above its all-time low of $0.0000869. Technical analysis also suggests that DOGE is forming a falling wedge pattern with bullish divergence, a technical setup that often precedes upward price action. Dogecoin price chart | Source: TradingView While this indicates potential for a rebound, confirmation through increased buying pressure is necessary. If bullish momentum emerges, DOGE could reclaim higher ranges and regain investor confidence, especially since its 24-hour trading volume of approximately $665 million signals healthy liquidity, which could support a recovery if the market sentiment shifts.

A crypto analyst has shared details on whether the current pause reflects healthy consolidation or a shift in momentum that could influence the broader crypto market. A recent analysis by crypto analyst Tony Severino shows that Bitcoin is entering a critical decision phase, with price action indicating a maturing trend. His chart highlights a robust upward structure that has begun to slow, signaling a shift in market behavior rather than an immediate price reversal. Notably, this moment is significant not just for Bitcoin but for the broader crypto market, which often follows its lead. Crypto Market Next Move As Bitcoin Hits Key Phase Severino’s chart illustrates a steady climb in Bitcoin’s price, marked by higher highs and measured pullbacks, indicating that buyers have largely been in control. However, recent candles show slower momentum and smaller bodies, suggesting that BTC’s bullish strength is starting to waver. The analyst has stated that the market is currently testing whether buyers still have the strength to push prices to upper levels or if Bitcoin’s upward move has run its course. Related Reading: Economist Blasts Strategy’s Bitcoin Bet, Despite $8 Billion Profits, Here’s Why Another key feature of the chart is the Doji candle forming near the top of the trend. Severino notes that this candle should not be interpreted as a sell signal, but rather an acknowledgement by the market that Bitcoin’s upside certainty has ended. The candle is also viewed as an early sign of hesitation, with multiple market outcomes possible. Severino explained that the market could enter a period of digestion, where Bitcoin’s price consolidates while maintaining a larger uptrend. Alternatively, the pause could signal distribution, with stronger hands beginning to transfer risk as BTC’s momentum fades. Another possibility is a final push higher driven by renewed conviction and late-cycle momentum. In that scenario, Bitcoin could break out of its current slowdown and extend gains before any new correction. Notably, Severino’s chart analysis does not confirm which path the market could ultimately take, only that the next sequence is expected to be decisive. Bitcoin Price Faces Potential Decline To $35,000 In a separate post, crypto market expert Lofty warned that Bitcoin could extend its downtrend, potentially triggering a deeper price crash. He pointed out striking similarities between the current BTC cycle and the 2021 bull run, highlighting a Double Top pattern that has preceded a significant price drop in the past cycle. Related Reading: Bitcoin 4-Year Cycle Is Dead: Crypto Trader Explains What Happens Next According to Lofty, if Bitcoin follows its historical four-year trend, its price could collapse to $35,000 within the next two weeks. Notably, the cryptocurrency has already completed its Double Top formation and is showing early signs of a prolonged downtrend. If the price declines to $35,000, it would represent a more than 60% drop from its current value of over $88,500.

According to reports from Crypto in America, the Republican-led chamber will examine the proposed legislation, known as the CLARITY Act, on January 15. This review follows a significant delay from last year and represents a concerted effort by lawmakers to provide long-awaited legal certainty for the multi-trillion dollar crypto industry. The move confirms earlier statements from David Sacks, the White House’s head of AI and cryptocurrency, who indicated the Senate would prioritize the bill early in the new year. Crypto Market Structure Bill Aims to Resolve Regulatory Uncertainty The core objective of the CLARITY Act is to establish a definitive regulatory framework for digital assets. Consequently, the legislation seeks to end years of jurisdictional ambiguity by clearly delineating the roles of two primary federal regulators. Firstly, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) would maintain authority over digital assets classified as securities. Secondly, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) would oversee those deemed commodities. This division of labor is designed to prevent overlapping enforcement and provide clear guidelines for crypto businesses operating in the United States. Furthermore, the bill contains a critical provision to exempt certain cryptocurrencies from the registration requirements of the Securities Act of 1933. To qualify for this exemption, a digital asset must meet specific, stringent criteria demonstrating its decentralized nature and functional utility beyond mere investment potential. This exemption could shield numerous established blockchain networks from costly and complex securities registration processes, thereby fostering innovation while maintaining investor protections. Historical Context and Legislative Journey The path to this January review has been lengthy and complex. Republican senators initiated a strong push for comprehensive crypto legislation in the previous congressional session. However, debates over the scope of regulatory power and consumer protection provisions led to the delay. The current effort builds upon multiple draft bills and years of committee hearings, expert testimony, and industry feedback. Analysts note that the renewed push aligns with growing institutional adoption of blockchain technology and increasing pressure from other global financial hubs that have already enacted clearer digital asset laws. Potential Impacts on the Digital Asset Ecosystem The passage of the CLARITY Act would create immediate and far-reaching effects across the financial landscape. For cryptocurrency exchanges and trading platforms, regulatory clarity would reduce legal risk and potentially lower compliance costs. Additionally, traditional financial institutions awaiting clear rules before deepening their crypto involvement may finally enter the market at scale. This influx of institutional capital could enhance market liquidity and stability. For developers and blockchain projects, the exemption criteria provide a measurable standard for decentralization. This could accelerate the development of genuinely decentralized protocols while discouraging projects that are centralized in nature from attempting to circumvent securities laws. The table below outlines the potential jurisdictional split under the proposed framework: Regulatory Body Proposed Jurisdiction Example Assets (Potential) Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) Digital assets offered as investment contracts or centralized projects. Tokens from initial coin offerings (ICOs), certain stablecoins. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) Decentralized digital commodities and related derivatives. Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), decentralized utility tokens. Market participants have largely welcomed the legislative progress. “Clear rules of the road are essential for the maturation of this asset class,” stated a representative from the Blockchain Association, an industry advocacy group. “This bill represents a critical step toward integrating digital assets into the mainstream U.S. financial system.” Expert Analysis on the January 15 Review Legal and policy experts emphasize the significance of the upcoming Senate review. The session will likely involve detailed scrutiny of the bill’s language, particularly the definitions used to classify assets and the specific powers granted to the SEC and CFTC. Key points of discussion will include: The Definition of ‘Decentralization’: How the bill legally defines a sufficiently decentralized network to qualify for the securities exemption. Consumer Protection Mechanisms: Ensuring the framework adequately protects retail investors from fraud and market manipulation. Interagency Coordination: Establishing efficient processes for the SEC and CFTC to collaborate on borderline cases. Observers note that bipartisan support will be crucial for the bill’s advancement beyond the review stage. While championed by Republicans, elements of the CLARITY Act have drawn interest from Democrats concerned about fostering responsible innovation. The White House’s engagement, signaled by David Sacks’s comments, suggests the administration is monitoring the process closely, potentially seeking a balanced approach that safeguards financial stability without stifling technological advancement. Global Implications and Competitive Landscape The United States’ regulatory approach carries substantial weight internationally. Major economies like the European Union, with its Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA) framework, and the United Kingdom, with its own regulatory proposals, have moved ahead with legislation. A coherent U.S. framework could set a global standard, influence cross-border regulatory cooperation, and determine whether the U.S. remains a leader in the digital asset space. Conversely, further delays could push innovation and capital to more defined jurisdictions abroad. Conclusion The January 15 US Senate review of the crypto market structure bill marks a decisive moment for the future of digital asset regulation in America. The CLARITY Act proposes a foundational framework to resolve the persistent conflict between the SEC and CFTC, offering exemptions for decentralized networks and providing the clarity that industry participants have demanded for years. While the legislative process remains complex, this review represents the most significant congressional action on comprehensive crypto legislation to date. Its outcome will profoundly influence the trajectory of blockchain innovation, institutional adoption, and the United States’ position in the global digital economy for years to come. FAQs Q1: What is the CLARITY Act? The CLARITY Act is a proposed U.S. Senate bill designed to create a clear regulatory structure for cryptocurrencies. It aims to define whether the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) or the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) has primary authority over different types of digital assets. Q2: When will the US Senate review the crypto market structure bill? The Republican-led U.S. Senate has scheduled a review of the bill for January 15, 2025. This follows a delay from the previous legislative session. Q3: How would the bill change how cryptocurrencies are regulated? The bill would formally divide regulatory responsibility: the SEC would oversee digital assets classified as securities, while the CFTC would oversee those classified as commodities. It also includes provisions to exempt certain decentralized cryptocurrencies from securities registration. Q4: Why is this legislation considered important? It is important because the U.S. currently lacks a unified federal regulatory framework for crypto, leading to uncertainty for businesses, developers, and investors. Clear rules are seen as essential for protecting consumers, fostering responsible innovation, and allowing the U.S. to compete globally. Q5: What happens after the Senate review on January 15? The review is a procedural step in the legislative process. Following the review, the bill may be amended, sent to committee for further work, scheduled for a floor vote, or face additional delays. It must pass both the Senate and the House of Representatives and be signed by the President to become law.

The deal includes a $500 million pool to keep employees on board, according to sources with knowledge of the transaction. It’s a major moment in the battle for global AI supremacy, with a major American tech company acquiring a startup with strong Chinese ties. This is generating numerous questions regarding the future of other Chinese AI companies seeking to expand internationally and draw in American investment. Manus executives rejected Chinese offers to stay relevant in the West Manus , which came out of parent company Butterfly Effect, built a tool that cranks out detailed research reports and handles all sorts of complex tasks using AI models from Anthropic and others. But here’s where things get interesting. Manus’s leaders, Xiao Hong and Ji Yichao, have distanced themselves from China. Earlier this year, several Chinese local governments came knocking with investment offers. The founders said no. They worried that taking Chinese government money would put them under a microscope in the West and mess up their international business. They also ditched a plan to team up with Alibaba on a Chinese version of the tool, even though they’d announced it in March, sources said. In 2025, Manus executed strategic business initiatives aimed at drawing in international investment and promoting global expansion. The firm moved its HQ to Singapore, grew its local workforce, and formed alliances with Microsoft and Stripe. It also secured $75 million in funding spearheaded by Benchmark, a well-known American venture capital firm. In December, Manus said its revenue run rate had jumped to $125 million from $90 million in August. Meta started talking about the acquisition in mid-December. Mark Zuckerberg wanted to get a deal done before the year ended, sources said. Some of the startup’s existing investors were caught off guard by how fast it all happened, according to those sources. Before Meta came calling, Manus executives and their investors had been weighing whether to stay independent and raise a lot more money, people familiar with the discussions said. They were facing the same problem many successful AI startups run into: getting to global scale without a platform partner like Meta would be tough and expensive, and raising more money could make them too pricey for anyone to buy. What Manus gets from the deal The acquisition hands Manus the keys to Meta’ s distribution channels, WhatsApp, Instagram, and a parent company with deep pockets for computing and infrastructure costs. Meta says it’ll keep running and selling Manus’s service while weaving it into its social media products. “Manus’s exceptional talent will join Meta’s team to deliver general-purpose agents across our consumer and business products, including in Meta AI,” Meta said to the Wall Street Journal. Meta spokesperson Andy Stone made clear that Chinese ownership in Manus ends when the deal closes, and the startup will shut down its services and operations in China. The deal got mixed reactions in Beijing and Washington Some Chinese officials weren’t happy, viewing Manus as proof of China’s AI strength, sources said. They figured the sale would hand over technology built by Chinese engineers to the United States and push other startups to follow the same path. Beijing doesn’t seem to have many ways to stop the transaction since Manus operates out of Singapore. Washington was pretty quiet about it, which suggests Manus’s work to follow American rules on overseas investments in key technologies eased worries about its Chinese ties.

Despite the monthly setback the sector remains significantly larger than a year ago. Total assets invested in global crypto ETFs stood at $179.16 billion at the end of November reflecting a 17.8% increase year-to-date from $152.10 billion at the end of 2024. Crypto ETFs listed globally suffered net outflows of US$2.95 Bn in November, @etfgi https://t.co/TyXvIqjrN9 #Register your interest for our 2026 events at https://t.co/ZYBgBU4o5I pic.twitter.com/zAJ3wgcxUw — ETFGI (@etfgi) December 31, 2025 Assets Pull Back From Record Highs The November outflows followed a sharp pullback from September’s record asset level of $229.53 billion as crypto markets cooled and investors took profits after a strong run earlier in the year. ETFGI notes that heightened volatility across digital asset markets weighed on investor sentiment during the month. Year-to-date net inflows total $47.87 billion making 2025 the second-strongest year on record for crypto ETF flows. Only 2024, which saw $72.08 billion in net inflows, posted a higher annual figure, while 2021 ranked third with $9.02 billion. Bitcoin and Ethereum Drive Monthly Declines Bitcoin and Ethereum-linked products accounted for the bulk of November’s outflows. Bitcoin-focused ETFs and ETPs which dominate the market saw $2.36 billion in net outflows during the month, while Ethereum products recorded $1.36 billion in withdrawals. At the end of November Bitcoin-related products represented $142.46 billion in assets across 127 products, while Ethereum ETFs and ETPs held $25.05 billion across 62 products. Despite the November decline, ETFGI reports Bitcoin and Ethereum continue to lead year-to-date inflows attracting $26.26 billion and $12.89 billion, respectively. ETFGI data show that the global crypto ETF market remains highly concentrated. iShares is the largest provider with $83.15 billion in assets, representing 46.4% market share followed by Grayscale Advisors with $25.49 billion (14.2%) and Fidelity International with $21.86 billion (12.2%). Together, the top three providers account for 72.8% of global crypto ETF assets, out of a total of 75 issuers. Smaller Tokens Gain Modest Traction While Bitcoin and Ethereum dominate, smaller crypto themes are gradually gaining exposure. Solana-linked products held $1.38 billion in assets across nine products with $0.90 billion in year-to-date inflows. Cardano and Polkadot products remain niche, each holding well under $100 million in assets, though both posted modest positive flows in November. Select Products Buck the Trend Notably, the top 20 crypto ETFs and ETPs by net new assets collectively attracted $2.17 billion in November offsetting broader market outflows. The Canary XRP ETF led individual inflows, gathering $348.82 million highlighting continued investor appetite for selective crypto exposures even amid wider withdrawals. Overall, ETFGI said November’s data underscore a maturing crypto ETF market where periods of consolidation follow rapid growth rather than signal a structural retreat from digital assets. Sudden Reversal: Spot Bitcoin ETFs Pull In $355M U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs recorded a sharp reversal on December 30 , pulling in $355 million in net inflows and ending a seven-day stretch of persistent capital withdrawals. The move marked the strongest daily inflow since mid-December and came after nearly two weeks in which ETF investors steadily reduced exposure as prices softened and year-end liquidity thinned. Sosovalue data shows that the rebound was led by BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust which attracted $143.75 million in fresh capital on the day.

56653230,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=257772,1767200111,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,"Bitcoin Whale Transfer Stuns Market: 3,892 BTC Moves to Coinbase Institutional in $341 Million Pivot",https://bitcoinworld.co.in/bitcoin-whale-transfer-coinbase-institutional/,"BitcoinWorld Bitcoin Whale Transfer Stuns Market: 3,892 BTC Moves to Coinbase Institutional in $341 Million Pivot A seismic shift in Bitcoin’s blockchain occurred recently, capturing the attention of analysts and investors worldwide. Whale Alert, the prominent blockchain tracking service, reported a massive transfer of 3,892 BTC from an unknown wallet to the custody of Coinbase Institutional. Valued at approximately $341 million, this single transaction represents a significant movement of capital and provides a compelling case study in modern cryptocurrency market dynamics. This analysis will delve into the technical details, historical context, and potential ramifications of this notable event for the broader digital asset landscape. Decoding the $341 Million Bitcoin Whale Transfer The transaction, broadcast to the Bitcoin network and recorded immutably on its blockchain, involved precisely 3,892.00 BTC. At prevailing market prices, this equates to a staggering $341 million. The sender’s address remains unidentified, classified as an ‘unknown wallet’ by tracking services. This typically indicates a private, non-custodial wallet not directly linked to a major exchange or publicly known entity. The recipient, however, is clearly tagged as ‘Coinbase Institutional,’ the division of Coinbase catering to hedge funds, family offices, and other large-scale financial players. Such a direct on-chain move from private cold storage to a regulated institutional custodian is inherently significant. It often signals a strategic decision by a major holder, potentially preceding market activity like over-the-counter (OTC) sales, collateralization for loans, or preparation for institutional-grade financial products. Technical and Market Context of the Move To understand the scale, consider that the total transaction represents roughly 0.018% of Bitcoin’s entire circulating supply. While not unprecedented, moves of this magnitude are rare and closely monitored. Historically, large inflows to exchanges like Coinbase can precede selling pressure, as holders move assets to liquid positions. Conversely, they can also indicate institutional accumulation or preparation for using exchange-based financial services. The timing is crucial. This event occurred amidst a complex macroeconomic backdrop characterized by fluctuating interest rates and evolving regulatory clarity for digital assets in key jurisdictions. Furthermore, blockchain data shows the sending wallet had held these coins for a considerable period, suggesting a long-term holder, or ‘HODLer,’ initiating a strategic repositioning. Institutional Adoption and Cryptocurrency Liquidity The choice of Coinbase Institutional as the destination is a key detail. This platform offers services beyond simple retail trading, including: Prime Brokerage: Providing trading, custody, and financing in one package. Staking Services: Allowing institutions to earn yield on proof-of-stake assets. OTC Trading Desks: Facilitating large, private trades that minimize market impact. Regulated Custody: Offering secure, insured storage that meets compliance standards for large funds. A transfer of this size directly to this entity strongly implies an institutional motive. The holder likely seeks to engage with these advanced financial rails. This action aligns with a broader trend of traditional finance (TradFi) infrastructure integrating with digital assets. It provides tangible evidence of the deepening maturity of the cryptocurrency market, where billion-dollar movements are facilitated through regulated, professional channels. Historical Precedents and Market Impact Analysis Historical blockchain data provides context for assessing potential impacts. Analysts often cross-reference exchange inflow data with price action. For instance, the table below compares notable historical whale movements to exchanges with subsequent short-term BTC price performance: Date Range BTC Moved to Exchange Approx. Value Then 30-Day BTC Price Change Post-Transfer Early 2021 ~5,000 BTC $240 million -8% Late 2022 ~4,200 BTC $80 million +3% Mid-2023 ~3,500 BTC $95 million -5% As evidenced, the correlation is not absolute. Other macro factors often dominate. However, sustained large inflows can increase sell-side liquidity on an exchange’s order books. Market makers and algorithmic traders monitor these flows closely, potentially adjusting their strategies in response to the changing supply landscape. The immediate market reaction to this specific transfer was muted, suggesting it may have been an OTC arrangement settled on-chain, thus avoiding direct market slippage. Expert Perspectives on Whale Behavior and Transparency Blockchain analysts emphasize that transparency is a double-edged sword. While the transaction is public, the owner’s identity and intent remain private. This dichotomy is fundamental to Bitcoin’s design. Experts from firms like Chainalysis and Glassnode routinely analyze clustering heuristics to infer wallet relationships. They might attempt to link this ‘unknown’ wallet to past activity, such as receiving funds from a known mining pool or a prior exchange withdrawal years ago. Such forensic analysis can sometimes reveal if the entity is a long-term investor, a mining operation, or a crypto-native fund. The move to a U.S.-regulated institution like Coinbase also introduces a layer of compliance. The institution must perform Know-Your-Customer (KYC) and Anti-Money Laundering (AML) checks on the client, adding a regulatory footprint to previously anonymous coins. The Role of Tracking Services and Market Sentiment Services like Whale Alert act as critical information conduits. By parsing blockchain data and applying wallet labels, they provide real-time intelligence to the market. This democratizes access to data that was once the domain of specialized firms. The announcement of this transfer likely influenced trader sentiment on social media and trading forums. Discussions typically revolve around whether this is a ‘bearish’ signal for an imminent sale or a ‘bullish’ signal of institutional capital preparing to deploy further. Seasoned analysts caution against over-interpreting a single data point, advocating instead for a holistic view that includes derivatives market data, macroeconomic indicators, and on-chain metrics like exchange net flow and miner behavior. Conclusion The transfer of 3,892 BTC to Coinbase Institutional is a definitive example of high-value blockchain activity in the modern era. This Bitcoin whale transfer underscores the growing interplay between anonymous, decentralized holding and regulated, institutional financial services. While the immediate market impact was absorbed efficiently, the long-term implications are clearer. Movements like this validate the infrastructure built by companies like Coinbase to serve large-scale capital. They also highlight the unparalleled transparency of the Bitcoin network, where anyone can audit multi-hundred-million dollar transactions in real-time. As the digital asset ecosystem evolves, such events will continue to serve as vital data points for understanding the flow of value and the shifting strategies of the market’s most significant participants. FAQs Q1: What does a “whale transfer” to an exchange usually mean? It can indicate several things: preparation for selling (adding liquidity), moving assets for safekeeping with a regulated custodian, using the coins as collateral for a loan, or positioning for participation in institutional financial products offered by the exchange. Context from other market data is needed to infer intent. Q2: Why is Coinbase Institutional a significant destination? Coinbase Institutional provides services tailored for large financial entities, including prime brokerage, OTC trading, and compliant custody. A transfer directly to this label suggests the holder intends to utilize these professional-grade services, not just simple retail trading. Q3: Could this transaction affect Bitcoin’s price? A single transfer’s direct price impact is often minimal, especially if executed as an OTC trade. However, large inflows to exchanges can increase available sell-side supply on order books, which may influence short-term price pressure if actual market selling follows. Q4: How do tracking services like Whale Alert know where the BTC went? They use a combination of publicly known exchange wallet addresses (deposit addresses are often identified), blockchain clustering algorithms, and heuristics to label wallet destinations. Exchanges themselves do not typically disclose individual client activity, but their main deposit addresses are identifiable. Q5: What is the difference between an “unknown wallet” and an exchange wallet? An “unknown wallet” is generally a private, non-custodial wallet whose owner is not publicly identified. An exchange wallet is controlled by the exchange to custody user funds. Transfers to an exchange wallet mean the user is depositing funds into the exchange’s ecosystem.

Multiple surveys and expert analyses now point toward a pivotal year when AI transitions from productivity tool to workforce transformer, potentially reshaping employment landscapes across industries. The 2026 AI Labor Tipping Point Recent data reveals mounting evidence that artificial intelligence will fundamentally alter labor markets within the next two years. A November MIT study found that approximately 11.7% of current jobs could already be automated using existing AI technologies. Meanwhile, employers increasingly cite AI implementation as justification for eliminating entry-level positions and reducing workforce sizes. Enterprise venture capitalists participating in recent surveys consistently identify 2026 as the inflection point. They predict AI will move beyond simple efficiency tools to become autonomous agents capable of replacing human labor in specific domains. This transition represents a critical juncture for businesses, workers, and policymakers alike. The Data Behind the Predictions Several key indicators support the 2026 timeline: Current Automation Capacity: MIT research shows significant automation potential already exists Budget Shifts: Companies plan to redirect labor budgets toward AI investments Technology Maturation: AI agents will reach sufficient sophistication by 2026 Enterprise Adoption: Meaningful AI integration will accelerate through 2025 Venture Capital Perspectives on Workforce Transformation Eric Bahn, co-founder and general partner at Hustle Fund, expresses cautious uncertainty about the specific impacts. “I want to see what roles that have been known for more repetition get automated, or even more complicated roles with more logic become more automated,” Bahn explains. He questions whether the outcome will involve increased layoffs, higher productivity, or simply augmentation of existing workers. Marell Evans, founder and managing partner at Exceptional Capital, predicts direct budget competition between human labor and AI systems. “I think on the flip side of seeing an incremental increase in AI budgets, we’ll see human labor get cut and layoffs will continue to aggressively impact the U.S. employment rate,” Evans states bluntly. The Budget Reallocation Reality Multiple venture capitalists confirm that enterprise budgets will increasingly shift resources from traditional labor expenses to AI implementation. Rajeev Dham, managing director at Sapphire, agrees that 2026 will mark significant budget reallocations. Jason Mendel from Battery Ventures adds that AI will surpass being merely a productivity tool, becoming capable of automating work itself. Predicted AI Impact Timeline Timeframe Expected Development Labor Impact 2024-2025 AI integration and testing Entry-level job reduction 2026 Autonomous AI agents emerge Mid-level role automation begins 2027+ Widespread AI adoption Structural workforce transformation The AI Scapegoat Phenomenon Antonia Dean, partner at Black Operator Ventures, identifies a concerning trend where companies might use AI as justification for workforce reductions regardless of actual implementation success. “The complexity here is that many enterprises, despite how ready or not they are to successfully use AI solutions, will say that they are increasing their investments in AI to explain why they are cutting back spending in other areas or trimming workforces,” Dean observes. This “AI scapegoat” phenomenon could obscure genuine business challenges while accelerating workforce reductions. Dean suggests that “AI will become the scapegoat for executives looking to cover for past mistakes,” creating additional complexity for analyzing true AI impacts. Contrasting Industry Narratives AI companies typically promote narratives about job transformation rather than elimination. They argue their technologies shift workers toward “deep work” and higher-skilled positions while automating repetitive tasks. However, venture capitalists investing in these technologies express skepticism about whether this optimistic vision will materialize by 2026. The disconnect between AI developer promises and investor expectations creates uncertainty for workers and businesses planning for the near future. This gap suggests that realistic preparation requires considering multiple potential outcomes rather than relying on industry assurances. Historical Context and Future Implications Previous technological revolutions provide valuable context for understanding potential AI impacts. The industrial revolution, computerization, and internet adoption all transformed labor markets, but typically created new job categories even while eliminating others. The unique aspect of artificial intelligence involves its potential to automate cognitive tasks previously considered exclusively human domains. Current evidence suggests several possible 2026 scenarios: Job Displacement: Direct replacement of human roles by AI systems Productivity Enhancement: AI augmentation increasing human output Job Transformation: Creation of new AI-related positions Mixed Outcomes: Sector-specific variations across industries Regional and Sector Variations Labor impacts will likely vary significantly by geography and industry. Technology hubs may experience different effects than manufacturing centers. Service industries might transform differently than creative fields. These variations complicate blanket predictions but emphasize the need for targeted preparation strategies. Preparation Strategies for Businesses and Workers Forward-looking organizations are already developing response strategies for the anticipated 2026 shifts. These include workforce reskilling programs, AI integration roadmaps, and ethical implementation frameworks. Successful adaptation will likely require balancing technological adoption with human capital development. Workers concerned about automation should focus on developing skills that complement rather than compete with AI capabilities. These include complex problem-solving, emotional intelligence, creativity, and interdisciplinary thinking—areas where humans currently maintain advantages over artificial systems. Conclusion The consensus among enterprise venture capitalists points toward 2026 as a pivotal year for AI labor impact. While specific outcomes remain uncertain, preparation is essential for businesses, workers, and policymakers. The transition from AI as productivity tool to workforce transformer represents both challenge and opportunity, requiring thoughtful navigation in the coming years. The 2026 AI labor impact will likely shape economic landscapes for decades, making current understanding and preparation critically important. FAQs Q1: What percentage of jobs are currently vulnerable to AI automation? A November 2023 MIT study estimates that 11.7% of existing jobs could already be automated using current AI technologies, with this percentage expected to increase by 2026. Q2: Why are venture capitalists specifically predicting 2026 for significant AI labor impact? VCs cite technology maturation timelines, enterprise adoption cycles, and budget reallocation patterns that converge around 2026 as the point when AI transitions from augmentation tool to autonomous workforce component. Q3: Will AI completely replace human workers or create new jobs? Experts predict mixed outcomes, with some job displacement balanced against potential new role creation. The net effect remains uncertain and will likely vary significantly across industries and regions. Q4: How can workers prepare for potential AI impacts on their careers? Developing skills that complement AI—such as complex problem-solving, creativity, emotional intelligence, and interdisciplinary thinking—can help workers remain valuable alongside advancing technologies. Q5: Are companies already using AI as justification for workforce reductions? Some venture capitalists report observing this trend, where companies cite AI investments as reasons for cutting labor budgets, regardless of actual AI implementation success or readiness.

56655429,649797,1767200446,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/56655429.jpeg,Here’s Why The Cardano Network And ADA Could Be A Dominant Force In 2026,https://bitcoinist.com/cardano-to-dominate-2026/,"With multiple milestones and advancements in 2025, the Cardano (ADA) network is ending the year on a successful note. After experiencing periods of growth and drawdowns, a growing number of analysts believe that the leading network could be set for a more successful and bullish 2026. 2026 Will Be The Year Cardano Will Shine 2025 was a turning point for the Cardano network, following key achievements and multiple projects launched on the blockchain within the year. However, with its robust ecosystem and fundamentals, new speculations are that 2026 could be an even better year for the network. Related Reading: Cardano Founder Reveals “Game Plan” For 2026, But Can ADA Price Still Recover? In a recent post on the social media platform X, an analyst with the nickname Cardanians has declared that Cardano emerge as one of the dominant blockchain networks in 2026. The prediction is based on a number of structural changes taking place throughout the entire ecosystem , not just hype. From consistent protocol updates and scalability enhancements to an increase in interest in its governance approach and practical uses, the network is preparing for a bullish 2026. As these pieces begin to align, this forecast is rekindling discussion about whether Cardano’s methodical approach may translate into significant influence during the upcoming market cycle. Cardanians have outlined some key developments that are fueling the prediction of a dominant 2026. These include Transaction Per Second (TPS) scaling with Leios, Bitcoin Decentralized Finance (DeFi) integration, and the Midnight partner chain mainnet is set to go live next year. Another major milestone is the fact that the network is currently included in multiple crypto index Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs). Meanwhile, an ADA ETF launch is already making waves, awaiting approval from the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). In addition, Cardano is set to have Tier-1 stablecoins, Pyth Oracle, Dune analytics, and more new integrations in 2026. On top of that, the platform stated that the network already boasts the strongest fundamentals in the cryptocurrency and blockchain sector. “These developments will make it impossible to ignore that 2026 will be a good year,” the platform added. A Surge In DEX Trading Volume Trading activity on Cardano’s Decentralized Exchanges (DEX) is starting to make headlines after a notable surge, suggesting a major shift in on-chain behavior. As seen on the chart , the network’s DEXes trading volume has reached 417 million ADA in December alone, a sign that traders and liquidity providers could be stepping back into the ecosystem. Related Reading: 141,000 Transactions: Here’s Why The Cardano Network Is Roaring Back To Life This surge nearly matches the levels from December 2024, when on-chain trading was at an all-time high.

For instance, trading XRP and SOL has been twice as volatile as trading BTC over the past 12 months, indicating a lack of maturity in those altcoins and reinforcing the perceived dominance of BTC across the cryptocurrency landscape. Data tracked on-chain revealed today that XRP and SOL experienced volatility of 80% and 87%, respectively, compared to 43% for BTC. Other altcoins, including Ether and BNB, recorded increases of 76% and 51%, respectively. This trend quashed the hopes that altcoins could surpass BTC’s dominance in 2025 and extend its perceived lead across the crypto landscape. Altcoins need deeper liquidity to achieve stability So far, billions have been pumped into SOL and XRP ETFs and CME futures, from which these major cryptocurrencies benefit in terms of liquidity. Except for BNB, other major altcoins, including XRP, SOL, and ETH, have established ETFs with billions in net assets. For instance, the XRP ETF has received a net inflow of approximately $1.16 billion since its launch, while the SOL ETF has attracted roughly $763 million, based on data provided by SoSoValue. If demand remains strong across altcoins in 2026, XRP, SOL, and ETH, alongside other altcoins, could help mitigate current price volatility and achieve the stability exhibited by BTC. The current volatility exhibited by altcoins suggests a persistent difficulty for these tokens in achieving stability. The trend in BTC volatility, especially after the launch of U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs in 2024, has been declining, underscoring the need for deeper liquidity in altcoins too. These suggest that alternative investment vehicles tied to XRP, SOL, and other altcoins may provide deeper liquidity, enabling the stability achieved in Bitcoin. Bitcoin ETFs were introduced in January 2024, attracting multiple ETPs, including IBIT, which has attracted the majority of investor money, amassing $62.19 billion since its launch. GBTC, on the other hand, has recorded a negative flow, seeing approximately $25 billion withdrawn since its launch. BTC ETFs so far have a cumulative total net inflow of $56.96 billion, according to SoSoValue. The surge in inflows has prompted several products, including covered calls on those ETFs. The strong demand has led to a steady decline in volatility in BTC this year. Meanwhile, Ethereum ETFs, which launched in mid-2024, have exhibited a similar trend, attracting approximately $12.4 billion of investor capital since their launch. BlackRock’s ETHA has attracted roughly $12.59 billion of investor money, while Grayscale’s ETHE has recorded the worst performance, losing approximately $5.05 billion to withdrawals since its launch. We could say the same for ETH ETFs as BTC, which has seen a decline in volatility to the current 76%. L1 tokens end the year with a negative or negligible return L1 tokens recorded the worst performance this year, resulting in zero or negative returns despite several key advancements across the networks. For instance, the Total Value Locked value for BTC has grown to $6.7 billion as of today, compared to an average of $760 million prior to October 2024. Source: Defillama; BTC’s Total Value Locked in DeFi The same can be said for Ethereum, Solana, and Base networks, which have exhibited a gradual increase in growth since 2021, demonstrating structural maturity across the cryptocurrency landscape. Despite reaching these significant steps in terms of maturity, returns exhibited this year have been very low across different blockchains. Based on on-chain data, the Bitcoin blockchain recorded a -6.76% return, alongside -12.94% for Ethereum and -11.48% for XRP. BNB has shown a positive return rate of 20.64% over the past 365 days.

The assessment reflects a wider view that XRP, like many alternative digital assets, may struggle to establish a sustained upward trend until market conditions improve and additional catalysts materialize. According to the Cointelegraph report attached to the tweet, analysts believe XRP could remain in a consolidation phase into the new year. While longer-term prospects are not dismissed, near-term momentum is expected to remain limited, particularly if broader market leadership from Bitcoin does not stabilize. NOW: Analysts expect XRP to chop sideways in 2026 until new bullish catalysts appear. pic.twitter.com/OVsfSqUQoU — Cointelegraph (@Cointelegraph) December 27, 2025 Second-Half 2026 Viewed as More Favorable The article cites analysis from Nansen senior research analyst Jake Kennis, which suggests that the latter half of 2026 may present more supportive conditions for XRP and other risk assets. This outlook is tied to expectations of improved macro and market dynamics rather than asset-specific developments alone. In the near term, however, analysts maintain a slightly bearish stance on altcoins, indicating that XRP’s performance may remain subdued until Bitcoin completes a period of consolidation or establishes a clearer bottom. Notably, no precise price targets for XRP were provided. Instead, the focus remains on identifying developments that could eventually alter the asset’s trajectory. Potential Catalysts Identified While short-term expectations remain restrained, several potential catalysts were highlighted as factors that could support a stronger move higher over time. These include the possibility of spot XRP exchange-traded fund approvals, deeper integration with global payment infrastructure, and broader efforts to position XRP as a liquidity or bridge asset within financial systems. Such developments are viewed as necessary to shift XRP away from range-bound trading and toward a more defined trend. Until then, consolidation is considered the more likely scenario. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Market Sentiment and ETF Activity Echoing a similar view, Jesus Perez, CEO of Posidonia21 Capital Partners, expressed expectations that XRP could hold around current levels rather than initiate a strong new trend at the start of 2026. This perspective emphasizes that XRP’s upside may depend more on sustained market narratives and sentiment than on immediate structural changes. Despite the cautious outlook, Cointelegraph noted that US-based spot XRP exchange-traded funds have shown notable strength in recent weeks, surpassing $1 billion in assets under management earlier this month. Market observers attribute part of this demand to XRP’s long-standing presence in the digital asset market and familiarity among investors. The report also highlights divisions among analysts regarding the wider crypto market’s direction in 2026. Some analysts point to current Bitcoin conditions as a limiting factor for altcoins attempting to reach new highs, reinforcing expectations that XRP’s performance will remain closely tied to broader market trends in the months ahead.

The latest rejection near $90,000 followed a brief short-covering spike above $89,000 on Dec. 30, rather than fresh long demand. Holiday-thinned books amplify every order. U.S. trading venues show 24-hour BTC spot volume near $34 billion, down from peaks above $70 billion around the October 6 all‑time high of $126,279 , a period that also saw the October 10 liquidation shock wipe out heavily margined longs. Additionally, funding rates and open interest have stayed muted since that October wipeout, and December has delivered more range trading than trend. ETF Flows and Market Sentiment ETF flows line up with the price action, as a CoinShares report noted that digital asset products saw $446 million in outflows in the week to December 29, with Bitcoin products losing $443 million and total post‑October 10 outflows hitting $3.2 billion. Source: CoinShares. Daily U.S. spot Bitcoin ETF prints from Farside and secondary aggregators show a $19.3 million net outflow on December 29, followed by a $355 million net inflow on December 31 that broke a seven‑day outflow streak, with BlackRock’s IBIT adding $143.8 million and ARKB adding $109.6 million. Although flows flickered back to positive, it still wasn’t enough to push BTC through the $90,000 wall. Macro desks also saw holiday effects. CoinShares noted that ETF trading volumes fell to $24 billion in the late‑November Thanksgiving week versus $56 billion the week before, and similar liquidity compression has appeared across BTC spot and derivatives into New Year’s Eve. Other risk assets have also shown the same pattern, with EUR/USD stuck and digital-asset indices logging drawdowns of more than 22% in Q4 as December’s “Santa rally” fizzled. Outlook and Market Positioning The holiday tape tells you more than the candles. BTC holding $86,500–$90,000 with compressed realized volatility, persistent but moderating ETF outflows, and one strong daily ETF inflow print into year-end sets up a clean positioning reset for January. Desks that de-risked after the October liquidation shock now face a market where spot is 30% below the $126,279 high , realized vol is dampened, and ETF channels have still attracted tens of billions in 2025 despite recent weekly outflows, which creates room for re‑risking if January flows flip decisively positive. The practical read for traders: respect $86,500–$90,000 as the holiday range, watch U.S. ETF flow tapes and derivatives basis once full liquidity returns next week, and size with the assumption that the first real break of this band in normal liquidity will set the tone for Q1 risk across crypto books.

Inspired by the character Brett from Matt Furie’s “Boys’ Club” comic series, BRETT aims to engage users through humor and community interaction. It has quickly gained popularity, boasting a market cap exceeding $1 billion and a total supply of 10 billion tokens, with a fixed supply ensuring scarcity. BRETT operates on a renounced contract, meaning the creator cannot alter its supply or functionalities, which fosters a decentralized governance model driven by community engagement. The token does not impose transaction fees, making it attractive for trading and long-term holding. Its cultural significance and partnerships in decentralized finance enhance its utility and value in the crypto space.

Price is compressing into a tight base, but the broader structure still shows lower highs and lower lows, keeping sellers in control. Momentum is weak, with RSI near 39 and struggling to regain the 40–50 zone, while MACD stays below zero, signaling lingering bearish pressure. Immediate support sits around $0.0130–$0.0135. A breakdown risks $0.0120. Bulls need a close above $0.0155–$0.0160 to target $0.0200. BRETT/USD 4-hour chart BRETTUSD chart by TradingView On the 4-hour chart, BRETT continues to trade in a well-defined bearish structure after the sharp October breakdown from the $0.045–$0.050 region. Price has since formed consistent lower highs and lower lows, with sellers controlling momentum. Current consolidation around $0.0137 reflects exhaustion, but no clear reversal signal is present yet. MACD remains near the zero line with weak histogram, showing fading momentum rather than bullish strength. Immediate support lies near $0.0130, while resistance stands at $0.0155 and $0.0180. A sustained break above $0.0180 is needed to confirm trend recovery.

BRETT’s next price phase is likely to remain cautious and range-bound unless a clear breakout occurs. After prolonged downside pressure, the chart shows selling momentum weakening, suggesting a potential short-term stabilization. Buyers may attempt a relief bounce toward the $0.0155–$0.0180 resistance zone, where strong selling interest previously emerged. Failure to reclaim this area would likely invite renewed downside, with $0.0130 acting as critical support. If that level breaks, the market could test lower psychological levels near $0.010. Overall, the trend remains bearish, but declining momentum hints at consolidation before the next decisive move, favoring patient and risk-controlled positioning. Why is BRETT down today? BRETT is down today primarily due to persistent bearish structure and weak buying momentum visible on the chart. Price continues to trade well below key moving averages, confirming that sellers remain in control. Each recovery attempt has been met with lower highs, signaling distribution rather than accumulation. The sharp breakdown earlier in the trend damaged market confidence, and volume during rebounds has remained thin, suggesting limited demand. RSI stays below the neutral zone, reflecting continued selling pressure and lack of strong bullish conviction. Without a confirmed breakout above nearby resistance, short-term traders continue to sell rallies, keeping the price under pressure today. Is BRETT a good investment? BRETT cryptocurrency, a meme coin on the Base blockchain, has gained popularity due to its community-driven nature and fixed supply, which enhances scarcity. While it shows growth potential, especially with integrations in DeFi, its value is highly speculative and influenced by market trends. Investors are strongly advised to exercise caution and conduct their research. Will BRETT reach $1? Based on the analysis’s critical prediction, it is unlikely to reach this milestone before 2030. Will BRETT reach $5? BRETT’s near-term goal of reaching $5 seems unlikely. Current predictions suggest it may peak at around $0.15 by 2030, influenced by crypto market trends and community support. Is Brett listed on Binance? Brett Coin (BRETT) is currently not listed on Binance for trading. Although it remains available on other exchanges like Bybit, Gate.io , and KuCoin Does BRETT have a good long-term future? BRETT is projected to reach between $0.049 by 2027 and $0.15 by 2030, depending on market conditions and the adoption of the Base network. Its growth is expected to be influenced by cryptocurrency market trends and regulatory developments.

Mantle has become the best-performing layer-2 through 2025, potentially credited to its push for tokenization-as-a-Service.

MNT USDT 1-day chart, bullish pennant pattern. Source: TradingView . A credible scenario as momentum indicators flash reversal signs. The RSI nears the 30 oversold threshold, a level that has historically marked local bottoms and subsequent bull runs for the Mantle price. More so, the MACD levels off below the signal line. Sell pressure has been consistent, but not escalating, placing the blame on a lack of demand. If buyers step back in, the bull-case scenario could unfold: a 300% breakout move into new price discovery targeting $3.80. Still, interim resistance around $1.80 and the $3 all-time high will be key proving grounds for a sustained upwards move. PepeNode: A Way to Avoid the Pitfall of Meme Coin Investors Late entrants on Mantle now face a decision: sit out and miss out on the next leg up, or enter and risk exposure to potential heavy losses. PepeNode ($PEPENODE) removes much of that pressure by offering a way to accumulate without needing perfect timing — the pitfall of most investors. It’s a simple mine-to-earn (M2E) game. No hardware needed. Just log in, acquire virtual nodes, stack rigs, and configure their setup to begin generating passive rewards diversified across leading meme coins.

Both companies, which let users bet on real-world events, became the biggest winners in 2025’s startup financing sweep, drawing the largest U.S. rounds and two of the top five globally. The data comes from PitchBook, which tracked a total $55.94 billion raised by fintechs worldwide this year, up 25% from $44.75 billion last year. But 2025’s total is still far from the $123.99 billion thrown around in 2021. That was when interest rates were basically zero, and investors were chasing anything with a website and a pitch deck. Polymarket and Kalshi outshine Plaid, Stripe and everyone else Polymarket pulled in its $2 billion round in October at a $9 billion valuation, but it plans to raise again with a valuation between $12 billion and $15 billion, Bloomberg said in October. That would push it ahead of some of the big legacy names like Plaid and Stripe, which didn’t raise anything near this scale in 2025. Kalshi, meanwhile, raised $300 million in October, then locked in another $1 billion by December. Its valuation now stands at $11 billion. These rounds didn’t just beat out crypto competitors. They beat out everyone. The size alone is unusual, especially after a dry spell where deals this big just stopped happening. Matt Streisfeld, general partner at Oak HC/FT, said this kind of activity is rare. “We have not seen these types of very large primary capital raises in some time,” he said. He’s been watching capital concentrate around a smaller group of companies, and he’s not surprised to see the money piling into places like Polymarket and Kalshi. “You’re going to see more doubling down on the perceived market winners in each category,” Matt said. “The last thing we need is 10 new players to be added to the actual five players that are already in the market.” The overall number of deals in 2025 dropped to 3,712, down 19% from 2024. That funding just got funneled into fewer hands. Companies that already had a foothold got even bigger, while newer players had a harder time getting in. Trump’s lighter rules help fintech raise cash and go public The regulatory environment has also changed under President Donald Trump, who returned to office in 2025. With restrictions eased, especially around banking relationships, fintechs are finding it easier to grow. That’s pulling in more investors. Matt said the money is chasing “greater commercial adoption,” and that is helping crypto companies too. This year, Coinbase landed partnerships with both Citigroup and PNC, showing how crypto platforms are finally plugging into the traditional banking system in a way that actually matters. While some critics say the rule changes are happening too fast, it’s a sharp contrast to the chaos of 2021. That year was all about fantasy growth projections and marketing. Now, there’s more scrutiny, and investors want actual numbers. “A lot of the craze that happened in ’21 was based off projected growth,” Matt said. “That wasn’t a bad mentality, it was just that companies were being valued at these unsustainable compounding growth rates.” Meanwhile, Ramp Inc. raised around $1 billion through three funding rounds of over $200 million each, and currently sits at a $32 billion valuation, up from $13 billion at the start of the year. The looser oversight also helped fuel a run of IPOs. This year alone, Circle, Gemini, Chime, Klarna, and Wealthfront all went public, giving their backers a way to finally cash out. And this isn’t over. More fintech listings are expected in 2026. If you're reading this, you’re already ahead.

Mersinger has appointed former Bitcoin futures supervisor Amir Zaidi as her chief of staff. This strategic appointment brings substantial regulatory expertise to a key position overseeing digital asset derivatives markets. CFTC Commissioner Strengthens Team with Bitcoin Futures Experience Commissioner Summer K.

Bitcoin and other crypto assets have ended the year quietly, as investors showed less appetite for risk and avoided aggressive buying. Top altcoins, especially, have lost significant momentum despite similar year-end conditions. Volatility Vanishes Santiment said crypto trading activity has slowed sharply in the final weeks of 2025, as prices remain range-bound and holiday season distractions keep traders away. According to the analytics firm, Bitcoin and major altcoins are experiencing their weakest two-week trading stretch since the same period last year, and no major volatility catalyst appears to be in sight. However, the analytics firm pointed out a crucial difference from 2024. At that time, Ethereum and altcoins such as Solana, Cardano, and Dogecoin still showed strong engagement. However, these assets are now recording less than half of their previous weekly trading volumes. SOL, for one, remained unchanged over the past month and was trading at $126. Solana ETFs, in contrast, have seen notable inflows recently. Lookonchain found that these funds saw a one-day net increase of 36,533 SOL, recording $4.6 million, while a seven-day net gain stood at 87,667 SOL, which is around $11.05 million. This positive momentum indicates that institutional investor appetite remains intact despite the underperformance in spot prices. ADA, on the other hand, lost 8% during the same period after falling from $0.417 to $0.349. Meanwhile, the OG meme coin, DOGE, also shared a similar fate after declining by almost 10% monthly as it trades near $0.122. Amidst signs of continued weakness, technical patterns like a death cross and head-and-shoulders depict further declines toward $0.08. Experts say that investor interest in the investment vehicle appears low, and declining futures open interest adds to the bearish sentiment. Altcoin Season in 2026? Altseason never really arrived in 2025. Despite occasional spikes in individual coins, the altcoin market, as a whole, lacked the momentum seen in previous cycles. Many major assets even struggled to gain traction against Bitcoin. This has dashed hopes of market watchers such as ‘Rekt Fencer,’ who believes that 2026 could witness a major altcoin season. According to the tweet, altcoins are currently near a macro bottom against BTC, and the dominance of “Others” is sitting at levels seen during previous alt rallies in 2017 and 2020. The analyst also pointed out that a dominance range of 12-13% historically indicates the start of a strong altcoin run, while 18-20% dominance has coincided with the largest alt seasons.

They start quietly. The process of development occurs behind the scenes. First users come without headlines. Then visibility appears so quick. According to commentators in the market, this is usually where value is created over the long term. A project, which has been constructed in months, may suddenly become a center of attention. Several investors are now of the view that Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is in that visibility state. What Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Has Been Developing Mutuum Finance is a developing DeFi platform that is based on lending and borrowing. The purpose is direct and straight to the point. Allow users to generate yield through provision of assets. Allow others to borrow on security without disposing of their assets. Dual lending is utilized in the protocol. On the one hand, users provide resources into pools. On the other hand, there is easy access to liquidity by the borrowers, with clear rules. Rates change accordingly with demand. The system is guarded by collateral limits and liquidations. This system promotes actual use rather than value pursuit. V1 of the protocol is the important turning point. Based on the official X statements, the team is in the process of separating a beta launch in the Sepolia testnet. It is then that the silent work takes a turn into the limelight. Users can test features. Metrics become visible. At that point, wider interest is a common phenomenon. Expansion Occurring Participation in the Mutuum Finance increased gradually before most traders started paying attention. The project has increased funds to the tune of $19.5M and has earned 18,700 holders. These figures did not auto-bump at night. They increased over time. According to the commentators in the market, this is important. A gradual increase is usually an indication of build up and not hyping. It demonstrates that users are not making last-minute reactions but rather, user positioning is early. This could mean more to investors who have the question of what to buy in crypto now than sudden spikes in the volume. It is this kind of development that makes MUTM increasingly be discussed as one of the most watched crypto to invest in at the next period of the market. The Reason Why the Supply Is In The Focus MUTM is currently selling at $0.04 with it being in presale Phase 7. The total supply is 4B tokens. That was in the form of 45.5% or approximately 1.82B MUTM that was placed under early distribution. To date, 820M tokens have already been sold. This is important since the supply reduces and so does behavior. The previous stages were more spacious. The subsequent stages are of lesser availability and higher costs. The token began at $0.01 and has been increasing on a step-by-step basis. That is 300% growth since inception. Moving on to the next crypto phase, the pricing is adjusted once more. It is structure that tends to change the way investors think. They re-evaluate timing other than waiting. This is where focus is escalated to by many following prices of crypto today. Visibility and The Ultimate Transition to Security Stack Security usually dictates its later adoption. Mutuum Finance has a 90/100 CertiK token scan rating. Halborn Security has also looked at the lending and borrowing contracts, the audit has been done and final changes are being made. Besides this, the team has also introduced a $50k bug bounty which targets code vulnerabilities. These are technical risk reduction measures and indicators of preparedness. A lot of analysts are of the opinion that this stage frequently precedes even higher exposure. Phase progression matters. Phase 6 sold out quickly. Phase 7 is now active. Allocation is tightening. Meanwhile, whale allocations have started appearing. When milestones are near, but not distant, larger wallets tend to move. Collectively, these indications are indicating a change. Mutuum Finance is transitioning into silent construction to something that is under implementation. This is usually the window that can alter things, especially to the investors who are setting up ahead of the year 2026. Markets are timed and organized. MUTM combines both. That is why a great number of people think that this new altcoin has the right to alter the appearance of a crypto-portfolio in a long-term perspective.

These efforts are intended to improve team familiarity with platform functionality, communication standards, and issue-handling procedures. Through standardized documentation and internal training processes, the platform aims to maintain consistent service quality expectations across different regions and language environments. Current Operational Status and Ongoing Adjustments HIGHTITAN stated that its updated user service framework has entered a phase of regularized operation.

56654915,https://cryptonews.com/?p=469210,1767202994,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/52/56654915.jpeg,LIT Token Plunges 22% as Lighter Airdrop Distribution Goes Live,https://cryptonews.com/news/lit-token-drops-22-percent-lighter-airdrop/,"LIT, the newly launched token of decentralized perpetuals exchange Lighter, slid sharply in pre-market trading on Tuesday as its long-awaited airdrop distribution went live, triggering heavy selling from early recipients and leveraged traders. The token initially climbed to a post-launch high of $4.04 shortly after trading began before reversing course and falling to around $2.62, a drop of roughly 22.2%. Source: CoinGecko That price also marked LIT’s lowest level since launch, reflecting sustained downside pressure as the market absorbed the large token distribution. LIT Sees Heavy Trading as Selling Outpaces Early Accumulation However, despite this excessive drop in price, the trading volume increased over the past 24 hours, as LIT experienced 13.43 million in trading volume, which is almost three times the amount that was experienced the day before. The increased volume was an indication of higher involvement in the market, which was mostly because of volatility, short-term speculation, and unwinding of positions, and not as a result of long-term accumulation. LIT is trading nearly 35% less than it was at its peak, and the token is now squarely in a post-launch correctional period, with the price discovery still underway. Data on-chain that was based on the airdrop provided additional information concerning the selling pressure, and the analysis of 10,000 wallets performed just after the distribution revealed that approximately 198.86 million LIT tokens were received by the participants initially. Source: Arndxt The existing balances in all those wallets are approximately 183.29 million LIT, which means that a significant part of the airdropped supply has already been decreased. Only 7.77% of wallets increased their holdings, while 45.88% reduced their balances and 46.35% made no changes, indicating that selling activity outweighed accumulation. In absolute terms, about 150.34 million LIT, or roughly 75.6% of the airdropped tokens, remain held. Around 48.52 million tokens, or 24.4%, have been sold or transferred. At the same time, only about 32.95 million LIT, representing 16.57% of the total, can be categorized as accumulated beyond initial allocations. The imbalance suggests that buy-side conviction has lagged behind sell-side activity in the early trading window. Lighter’s LIT Joins one of Crypto’s Largest Airdrops even as Tokenomics Come Under Scrutiny Derivatives market data reinforced this picture, as net flow indicators for LIT perpetual contracts showed consistent aggressive selling across multiple time frames. Net delta was negative by about $108,000 over one hour, widened to nearly $1 million over four hours, and deteriorated to more than $6 million over ten hours. Source: Arndxt Hourly net flow data over the last day also showed repeated negative swings, suggesting that price rebounds were met with renewed selling. The sell-off followed one of the largest token giveaways in crypto history as Lighter airdropped roughly $675 million worth of LIT tokens to early users, ranking the distribution as the 10th largest airdrop by dollar value, according to CoinGecko data. Source: Coingecko The airdrop surpassed 1inch Network’s 2020 distribution but remained well below Uniswap’s record-setting $6.43 billion airdrop. Some early users reported receiving six-figure allocations, highlighting the scale of the distribution. At the same time, debate around Lighter’s tokenomics intensified . Half of the total LIT supply is allocated to users, partners, and growth initiatives, while the remaining 50% is reserved for the team and investors, subject to a one-year cliff and multi-year vesting. Community reacts as @Lighter_xyz ’s $LIT token launches, with half the supply for insiders, sparking debate over its fairness as a community-focused launch. #Lighter #Tokenomics https://t.co/aZkUeD9UeK — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) December 30, 2025 The launch comes as Lighter continues to post strong trading metrics within a rapidly expanding on-chain derivatives market.

Jinping didn’t just talk chips and models, he plugged new progress in humanoid robots, military drones, and the Fujian aircraft carrier, now fitted with an electromagnetic launch system. The country’s GDP is set to hit 140 trillion yuan ($20 trillion) in 2025, and the government says it has met key targets from the current Five-Year Plan. China defies chip bans and fuels AI IPO surge China’s AI industry kicked the door open early in the year when startup DeepSeek released a cheap, powerful model that ignored Washington’s chip export bans and shocked Wall Street, caught Silicon Valley off guard, and proved that Jinping’s tech machine was not waiting for permission. In his speech, he called for even greater confidence in China, urging the nation to “maintain firm confidence and build on our momentum.” Following DeepSeek’s breakthrough, Chinese chipmakers rushed to IPO, raising billions in a push to fuel tech self-reliance. Meanwhile, Trump’s renewed trade war failed to choke China’s export strength. Instead of folding, Beijing leaned on its rare earths advantage, forcing concessions on tariffs and export restrictions. Chinese exports flowed to new markets, and for the first time ever, the country’s trade surplus topped $1 trillion, an unmatched record in global trade. Despite rising tensions, Jinping and Trump agreed to a one-year truce in South Korea back in October. That fragile peace has helped stabilize ties between the two countries. Trump is scheduled to visit China in April, and the tone from Beijing has clearly changed. In a noticeable change from his 2025 address, Jinping didn’t even mention “external uncertainties” as a risk going forward. Instead, he leaned into the start of the 15th Five-Year Plan, promising more development, less noise. Jinping pushes anti-corruption purge and tightens grip on Taiwan Not everything was a victory lap. Jinping brought back his anti-corruption drive, calling for the Communist Party to “remove decay and grow new flesh.” The purge has now expanded to include scores of military generals, with a record number of top-level officials caught in corruption investigations in 2025. Domestically, trouble hasn’t gone anywhere. Jinping confirmed that China still aims to hit a 5% growth target, even as parts of the economy weaken. Factory activity picked up slightly in December, hitting a PMI of 50.1, but overall signs aren’t strong. Investment fell again in November. Consumer spending dropped, and the property sector kept sliding, underlining soft demand at home. Still, Jinping has recently said the country should focus on quality over speed, and even warned against “reckless” development projects. He didn’t skip geopolitics. Taiwan came up, as always. “Compatriots on both sides of the Taiwan Strait are connected by blood that is thicker than water,” he said, adding that reunification is unstoppable. That came just after China wrapped up its largest-ever military drills around the island. For two days, People’s Liberation Army units surrounded Taiwan in a simulated blockade, with live-fire exercises and missiles splashing near the island’s edges.

After the December update from the team, the XPL coin has jumped over 15% in the last 24 hours. The update points out some improvements in the ecosystem numbers. USDT on Plasma is now supported on 30+ exchanges, with 8 added in December alone. Daily CEX USDT transactions have grown from around 5k post-launch to roughly 40k today. That means more and more people are trusting Plasma to transfer their money, which helps explain why it has reached a $2.1B stablecoin market cap. SyrupUSD₮ has grown to over $1.1B TVL since launch on Plasma.

According to the team, this is their main real-world product, and they are investing heavily to fix issues and push it toward a finalized release. Plasma Price Prediction: Further Increase Coming in 2026? Vance Spencer, the cofounder of Framework Ventures, said that “Plasma is going to make it in 2026,” pointing to a wave of new products set to be shipped. Framework Ventures led the fundraising round for Plasma, raising $20M at a $500M valuation. This is higher than the current XPL market cap of around $300M at the time of writing. You can sense the commitment here. The team has also said they are still fully committed to building Plasma around XPL and aligning the entire organization around it. Source: XPLUSD / TradingView XPL price is currently up over 60% from its bottom at $0.11 on December 20. Plasma crypto is up about 15% in the last 24 hours alone, yet the RSI is still around 53. That suggests there is still room for further upside. A move toward $0.20 would be the best-case scenario given current market conditions. A clean breakout above that level would likely open the door for a push back toward $0.30. A pullback toward the $0.15 support range is still possible, but a break below it would kill the momentum and could send the price to new lows. Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER): Where Real Utility Still Wins While most altcoins are still fighting market chop, Bitcoin Hyper is quietly positioning itself as one of the few projects actually solving a real problem. Bitcoin is the most secure network in crypto, but it is painfully slow and expensive. Bitcoin Hyper fixes that by bringing a high-performance Layer 2 built with Solana-grade speed directly to Bitcoin. Through the Hyper Bridge, BTC holders can move funds onto the Hyper L2 and receive a 1:1 representation with near-instant finality. That unlocks fast payments, DeFi, staking, meme coins, NFTs, and yield strategies, all while staying anchored to Bitcoin security. Bitcoin Hyper has already raised nearly $30M from early backers, showing strong conviction despite weak market conditions. With a 39% APY currently available and growing ecosystem integrations, $HYPER is shaping up as one of the few narratives that does not rely purely on speculation. If the next cycle rewards real infrastructure over hype, Bitcoin Hyper looks positioned to be one of the first beneficiaries.

Instead, it has changed course. Companies and countries have adjusted their trading patterns. The United States purchases fewer goods straight from China these days, but it buys more products from factories China owns in countries with lower tariff rates, such as Vietnam. Meanwhile, China ships more products to nearly every other nation, particularly inexpensive goods heading to Europe. Automakers move operations to America Nissan, a carmaker with plants on five continents, decided tariffs meant it should focus more on the United States. The company increased the number of Rogue SUVs it makes in Tennessee rather than bringing them in from Japan. It also started pushing other vehicles made in America, including the bigger Pathfinder SUV and Frontier pickup, while cutting back on imports from Mexico. “There’s been a very deliberate plan to put marketing dollars behind the cars that are being produced in the U.S.,” Jérémie Papin, Chief Financial Officer, said in a recent interview. The car business got hit hard by tariffs, with major companies together reporting close to $12 billion in extra tariff expenses earlier in the year. Until now, automakers such as Nissan have not raised their prices much, taking the financial hit themselves with smaller profits. The average price for a new car sat just under $50,000 in November, only 1.3% higher than the previous year, Cox Automotive data shows. April tariff announcement On April 2, the president revealed broad reciprocal tariffs of 10% on no fewer than 60 countries, but important trading partners faced steeper tariffs. China got hit with 34% tariffs, Japan with 24%, and the European Union with 20%. The tariff on cars brought into the country jumped to 25%. When Trump made his announcement, he pointed out some of the high tariffs other nations place on American farm products and automobiles. “They have taken so much wealth from our country, and we’re not going to let that happen,” Trump said then. He added later, “There is no tariff if you build your plant – your product – in America.” The tariff actions seemed to work. Over the following months, the president and his team would reveal trade deals to boost market access to the United Kingdom, including promises to purchase more ethanol, beef, cereals, fruits, vegetables, and other farm goods. Tensions with China With China, the Trump administration did more than just impose tariffs. Officials labeled Chinese organizations as national security threats, limiting U.S. money going into Chinese businesses. The United States also tightened rules on Chinese access to technology. Stopping soybean purchases came early, but Chinese officials made a much larger move in early October when the country revealed sweeping limits on rare-earth mineral exports. China controls about 70% of worldwide rare-earth mining and holds an even larger portion of processing capacity. China’s action on rare-earth minerals was so important that Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and U.S. Trade Ambassador Jamieson Greer held a press conference on Oct. 15, criticizing the impact it would create worldwide. Greer said China’s move “is not proportional retaliation” but “an exercise of economic coercion on every country in the world.” After that, both nations looked for a way out. By late October, China agreed to postpone its limits on rare-earth minerals for at least a year. The United States agreed to reduce tariffs by 10% and stop a rule that blocked Chinese companies from certain U.S. technology exports. Canadian relations worsen In March, Trump put 25% tariffs on Canadian products not included in the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA), except for energy and potash fertilizer imports, which got 10% tariffs. Canada fought back by putting 25% tariffs on roughly $30 billion worth of U.S. products. The overall Canadian tariff went up to 35% in August. The president then stopped trade discussions after the province of Ontario ran an advertisement in the United States using former President Ronald Reagan’s words criticizing tariff policies. Canadian leaders said a close partnership that had long helped the country had turned into a major weakness. Addressing affordability Trump started getting questions about affordability in the fall as shoppers complained about high prices. Nations such as Brazil were dealing with 50% tariffs, which raised the costs of some common items. In a speech earlier this month, Trump blamed the economy on his predecessor, saying, “I inherited a mess”, saying that the nation’s economy is stronger now than a year ago. On Truth Social on Dec. 27, Trump credited his tariff policies for helping the economy. “Tariffs are creating GREAT WEALTH, and unprecedented National Security for the USA. Trade deficit has been cut by 60%, totally unheard of. 4.3% GDP, and going way up. No inflation!!!

This design choice minimizes resource requirements, preserves decentralization, and reduces systemic risk even if it means pushing complex logic, programmability, and heavy computation to higher layers or external systems. How Bitcoin Avoids Complex State Transitions The fundamental limitation of Bitcoin is its inability to run heavy verification logic at a low cost, a core constraint that every BitVM-based bridge must navigate. According to the GOAT Network post on X, to address these issues, they are introducing a BitVM2 design that will ensure disputes are affordable enough to be executed under real fee conditions. The security mechanism is addressed through optimistic verification using garbled circuits (GC). Related Reading: Bitcoin Sees Unusual Short-Term Supply Spike, Raising Bearish Flags This operator, which is set to launch soon, publishes the garbled-circuit artifacts off-chain, while committing only the relevant labels on-chain. If the computation is correct, no on-chain action will be required. Meanwhile, if something is wrong, a challenger does not need to replay an expensive computation on-chain. Instead, they produce a minimal fraud-proof to reveal the output “0” label that contradicts the operator’s claimed result. At that point, the on-chain step is about demonstrating a contradiction, which will reduce the cost of disputes and change the economics of security. A practical detail in BitVM designs is that the garbled circuit size matters, and pairing heavy verification can cause bloated circuits. To avoid this, BitVM2 integrates a designated-verifier SNARK, which reduces verifier complexity so that the garbled circuits remain within realistic size limits. For end users, the implication is that the cheaper, more reliable depute paths make it harder for the bridge to stall when the fees spike. Public Companies Are Becoming Bitcoin’s Strongest Buyers While several projects are being introduced to improve the efficiency of Bitcoin, seasoned crypto expert and the founder of the Wealth Mastery Newspaper, Lark Davis, has revealed that many public companies are aggressively accumulating BTC. Currently, public companies collectively hold 1.09 million BTC, representing 5.1% of the total BTC supply, which is a new all-time high. Related Reading: Bitcoin Supply In Profit Sets The Stage For Bullish Cross In Q1 2026 However, the latest major aggressive purchases have come from MicroStrategy and Metaplanet. Strategy just announced another 1,200 BTC purchase, pushing its total holdings to 672,000 BTC. Asia-based firm Metaplanet also bought an additional 4,200 BTC in December, bringing its total holdings to 35,000 BTC. Davis pointed out that other recent purchases have come from Cango Inc., Bitdeer Technologies, and Anap Holdings. While retail investors are demonstrating weakening sentiment, public companies or institutional investors continue to stack regardless of the ongoing market.

Strategy CFO Addresses The Rumors,https://bitcoinist.com/is-the-bitcoin-price-manipulated-strategy-cfo/,"Bitcoin’s late-year slump has revived a familiar online refrain that the market is “controlled” and price is being suppressed but Strategy CFO Andrew Kang said the manipulation thesis doesn’t square with Bitcoin’s scale, and that even large, highly liquid public vehicles struggle to move the needle. Speaking on Natalie Brunell’s Coin Stories in an interview dated Dec. 30, Kang framed recent bearish sentiment as less about Bitcoin-specific weakness and more about how the asset still trades within a broader risk regime shaped by macro uncertainty, rate expectations, and tech volatility. Is The Bitcoin Price ‘Manipulated’? Brunell asked Kang to address speculation that Bitcoin has been manipulated “over the last quarter or so,” a narrative some commentators tie to the Oct. 10 liquidation event and the timing of an MSCI memo about potential index methodology changes for digital-asset-treasury companies. Kang didn’t rule out that some actors may want to influence markets, but he dismissed the idea of a coordinated, systemic suppression plan as implausible at Bitcoin’s current market size. “I honestly, you know, I think a lot of that comes from things that are fun to talk about,” Kang said. “Could there be minds that think like that? Most likely. But I think for the scale in which we operate, the magnitude of what Bitcoin is today in this market, it’s hard for any one actor to really manipulate the market. And for there to be a systemic sort of plan to do that feels a little far-reaching to me.” He added that conspiracy narratives often get stapled to Strategy itself including claims that its equity issuance or weekly buying is “why this happened” but argued that the asset has grown beyond any single corporate treasury’s ability to steer price action meaningfully. “The fact is Bitcoin is such a big asset class now,” Kang said. “Even Strategy has a hard time doing something that impacts it.” Don’t miss my first sit-down with Strategy CFO Andrew Kang! We discuss Strategy’s plan to keep accumulating Bitcoin, the asset’s underperformance in 2025, MSCI inclusion, whether there is “market manipulation” and much more. pic.twitter.com/yqGhQHadcW — Natalie Brunell (@natbrunell) December 30, 2025 The Real Reasons For BTC’s Price Action Kang repeatedly returned to the idea that Bitcoin remains an “emerging asset,” and that volatility is a feature of its current stage of adoption rather than evidence of hidden hands. He pointed to his own entry point in 2022, a year he recalled as a harsh lesson in downside moves, and argued that today’s sentiment doesn’t look uniquely Bitcoin-driven. “To me [the sentiment] isn’t Bitcoin specific,” Kang said, describing Bitcoin as still “viewed as a risk asset within a broader macro environment.” He cited uncertainty around Federal Reserve policy and rate expectations next year, while emphasizing that the long-term “intrinsic values” Bitcoiners cite, like finite supply and store-of-value framing, “still persist.” In one of his most emphatic passages, Kang laid out a sweeping view of Bitcoin’s long-run trajectory as Strategy’s rationale for continuing to raise capital and add to its balance sheet. “There’s still more upside to Bitcoin. We know it’s going to go from where it is today to, you know, back to $125K, up to $200K, up to a million, up to 21 million one day,” Kang said. “That all still is going to happen. It just is going to happen over a period of time. And there’s going to be volatility associated with it.” At press time, BTC traded at $88,730.",Bitcoin News,EN,0,0,BTC|MARKET|TRADING|MACROECONOMICS|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-12-31 18:00:26

Although it has struggled in the last few months, it has tested this area multiple times without breaking down. While sellers still maintain control, crypto analyst Javon Marks (@JavonTM1) believes the digital asset is heading toward a breakout. $XRP is holding a BULLISH PATTERN and looks to be getting ready for another huge wave up! As prices hold Higher Lows here with the MACD recently setting Lower Lows (LL), this is, in a technical analysis, a Hidden Bull Divergences and it suggests a continuation move HIGHER!… pic.twitter.com/MHz1FFYRYU — JAVONMARKS (@JavonTM1) December 30, 2025 A Bullish Pattern Forming for XRP Marks shared a chart that highlights both price structure and momentum behavior. He stated that the digital asset is holding a bullish pattern, and “looks to be getting ready for another huge wave up.” Marks emphasized that XRP continues to print higher lows even as momentum indicators diverge. The price structure remains constructive while the MACD has moved to lower lows, a setup that qualifies as hidden bullish divergence in technical analysis. This type of divergence signals underlying strength rather than weakening market control. The Hidden Bullish Divergence A hidden bullish divergence occurs when the price maintains an upward structure while the indicators pull back. That setup often appears during trend continuation phases. In this case, the MACD shows lower lows even as XRP’s price refuses to break support. The divergence suggests selling pressure lacks follow-through. Marks linked the setup directly to trend continuation and stated that the pattern points toward a bullish continuation . The chart supports that view. Momentum cooled after a sharp run, yet the price did not retrace deeply. Buyers defended prior breakout levels, keeping the trend technically intact. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Impact of the Prior Trend Marks also anchored his view in the broader context of the recent rally. XRP did not enter this consolidation from a weak position. He noted that the asset is “already coming from and maintaining a significantly bullish move.” That backdrop increases the relevance of the divergence. While recent months have seen notable declines , XRP shows an overall upward trend. Continuation signals carry more weight when they emerge after strength rather than prolonged decline. The analyst expects XRP’s next move to happen in this strength. The current consolidation zone now acts as a decision area. As long as XRP holds above the marked support line, the structure remains constructive. A failure would invalidate the setup, but maintaining it keeps the path open for expansion . Marks concluded with a forward-looking statement, writing, “this next wave could be just as powerful, if not even more so.” Disclaimer : This content is meant to inform and should not be considered financial advice.

The hourly price chart confirms that Pepe attempts to drop below the immediate support line; however, bulls are eyeing a further recovery rally in the coming hours. If Pepe’s price holds momentum above $0.00000430, it will fuel a bullish rally to $0.00000466. Pepeusd Chart By TradingView If bulls fail to initiate a surge, Pepe’s price may drop below the immediate support line at $0.00000382, beginning a bearish trend to $0.00000361. Is PEPE A Good Investment? Reviewing the Pepe project’s roadmap, it appears there are no detailed plans other than anticipation that $PEPE and similar meme coins will dominate. Given this lack of clear direction and with an already sizable community of over 500,000 Twitter followers, the project’s price growth potential may be capped. However, meme coins have a reputation for offering significant returns, as their values can surge dramatically when supported by strong community movements. This was evident when Pepe’s value skyrocketed by over 222% to reach a new all-time high (ATH) following its listing on the Binance exchange. A similar significant announcement in 2025 could propel Pepe to surpass its previous ATH. Why is Pepe down today? Pepe’s price faced minor selling around recent highs. This pushed the price of PEPE toward the intra low around $0.000004. Will Pepe Recover? If buyers hold the price above the $0.000004 level strongly, we might see further upward rally in the Pepe price chart. What is Pepe price prediction for 2025? The Pepe price prediction for 2025 expects the meme coin to record a maximum level of $0.000035. Will Pepe price reach $0.01? Pepe’s price might touch the $0.01 mark by the end of 2029. However, this price milestone entirely depends on the utility of Pepe coin and future buying demand. Will Pepe price reach $1? Pepe has a great community, and the hype is high for the meme coin. If everything remains good, we might see Pepe’s price touch $1 soon or by 2040. Recent news Blockchain analysis from Bubblemaps indicates that nearly one-third of Pepe’s initial token supply was controlled by a single wallet, contradicting the project’s “for the people” launch narrative. The cluster allegedly sold $2 million in PEPE the day after launch, creating sell pressure that analysts say hindered the token’s early growth. this is $PEPE at launch with time nodes on 30% bundled you were lied to https://t.co/Fsv4hXdurj pic.twitter.com/ha8pHXcss9 — Bubblemaps (@bubblemaps) December 10, 2025 PEPE Price Prediction December 2025 If BTC price records robust surges this month, we might see PEPE price skyrocketing. We expect the PEPE price to record minimum and maximum prices of $0.000004 and $0.000017, respectively. The average price might be around $0.00001. Month Potential low ($) Potential average ($) Potential high ($) December 2025 0.000004 0.00001 0.000017 Pepe price prediction 2025 The Pepe roadmap is somewhat vague, with few definitive plans beyond the expectation that $PEPE and similar meme coins will dominate the market. Despite its robust community, this lack of clear direction might cap the project’s price potential. Meme coins have a reputation for offering significant financial returns, as their values can surge rapidly when supported by their communities. The impact of major announcements was evident when Pepe’s value soared by more than 222% following its listing on the Binance exchange, reaching an all-time high. A similar event in 2025 could potentially send Pepe to new peaks. In 2025, Pepe’s minimum expected price is projected to be $0.000004. It may peak at a maximum value of $0.000035, with an average trading price of $0.000027 throughout the year.

The decision shuts down one part of a broader court fight that has dragged federal labor regulators into a direct clash with the rocket company over how worker agreements are written and enforced. The shift became official on December 18, when lawyers for SpaceX and the National Labor Relations Board jointly asked a federal judge in Texas to dismiss one of two lawsuits filed by the company. That case focused on claims that the agency itself was unconstitutional. The request came after the labor board decided to withdraw its complaint, making the court battle unnecessary on that front. Labor board drops Seattle complaint and narrows the fight The dispute started with a complaint issued in March 2024 by the NLRB’s Seattle office. Regulators claimed language in severance and arbitration agreements used by SpaceX went too far. The focus sat on confidentiality clauses that the agency said could pressure workers and block them from exercising protected rights. The company responded a month later by suing the board in federal court. That lawsuit argued the NLRB’s structure violated the Constitution. It was not the first time the company used that strategy. A separate lawsuit had already been filed after another complaint came out of the agency’s Los Angeles office. That California case accused SpaceX of retaliating against employees who criticized Elon Musk. By April, the labor board told a court it was reconsidering whether it even had authority to pursue that matter. Officials said they were reviewing whether the National Mediation Board, which oversees rail and airline labor disputes, should have jurisdiction instead. In May, a three-judge panel approved a joint request from the government and the company to pause proceedings in that second lawsuit. The pause allowed time for the NLRB to seek formal input from the National Mediation Board on who should control the case. Political pressure, court strategy, and leadership changes collide The agency’s retreat goes beyond one company. Since SpaceX filed its first constitutional lawsuit last year, other firms have followed the same path. Amazon.com Inc. is among the companies now challenging the labor board in federal court. Several of those cases remain active. William Cowen, the NLRB’s acting general counsel, said the agency made a strategic call. He explained that the confidentiality dispute involving SpaceX was not the right vehicle to take to the Supreme Court. “Is this the horse we want to ride on this issue?” Cowen said . “It was determined that that was really not the path to follow, which is why we backed off.” Cowen took the role in February after President Donald Trump named him acting top prosecutor at the agency. Under his leadership, the NLRB has pulled away from several high-profile actions launched by his predecessor. One involved allegations against private prison operator GEO Group Inc. over treatment of immigrant detainees. Another focused on an email sent by actor Sean Penn criticizing staff complaints at his nonprofit. Politics continues to sit close to the story. Musk was the largest single donor in the 2024 election cycle, with most of his spending backing Trump. His Department of Government Efficiency played a central role during Trump’s first year back in office. After a public split earlier this year, tensions eased. Elon attended a November White House dinner honoring Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, as Cryptopolitan reported live . The leadership picture at the labor board is also changing. This month, the US Senate confirmed Trump’s nominee for permanent NLRB general counsel, Crystal Carey. She previously worked as a partner at Morgan, Lewis & Bockius LLP, a company that represented companies including Tesla Inc. and SpaceX. Her swearing-in is expected soon.

The project is an emerging new crypto that offers far more upside potential and currently sells at an astonishing $0.04 per token. While XRP does enjoy the advantage of being one of the oldest altcoins in the marketplace, the altcoin does find itself struggling in the given environment, thanks to its immense market capitalization and the regulatory headwinds that show little promise of dissipating soon. Mutuum Finance, on the other hand, finds itself within the initial stages of its life cycle, where the token could enjoy significant upside on the back of its nascent phase and initial discovery, making it a new crypto that many investors are closely watching. Currently within Presale Phase 7, the token will see an immense appreciation after launch, where the initial buyers are poised to see an astonishing return on their investments. XRP Pressured as Bear Structure Dominates Ripple (XRP)’s performance is still being pressured, with the bearish formation still in place given that the market is still trading below major resistance. Technically, the current market formation of XRP is a descending channel. As long as the market remains under the resistance level created around the upper boundary of the descending channel, the most likely future movement will be the continuation of the current downward trend towards the identified level of support. For cryptocurrency market analysts looking into the performance of various cryptocurrencies, the limited momentum in the value of XRP reinforces the need to look into new crypto opportunities that promise higher potential. Here is where Mutuum Finance (MUTM) shines. MUTM Presale FOMO Mutuum Finance is among the most promising projects and has attracted the attention of many investors. The presale event of the project has hit another major milestone with over 18,620 participants having joined, and the total value raised exceeding $19.5 million. The current price of MUTM token stands at $0.04. MUTM will launch at $0.06 with potential to climb past $0.60. This positions current investors for more than a 10x ROI in the next bull run. The Mutuum Ecosystem Mutuum Finance is designed to be a next-generation decentralized finance lending and borrowing solution that can overcome some of the most challenging issues observed with the existing DeFi platforms. Essentially, the platform allows users the ability to lend idle assets to earn some extra income or borrow money against existing assets that they may already hold but don’t want to sell. Unlike some existing decentralized finance platforms that function on the basis of one lending solution, the system designed by the developers of Mutuum Finance allows two solutions that can cater to the interests of both conservative and aggressive investors. What sets Mutuum Finance apart is the availability of their dual lending system that incorporates peer-to-contract lending (P2C) and peer-to-peer lending (P2P). Under the P2C system, users have the capacity to directly transact with smart contracts at predetermined interest rates that provide immediate liquidity even when dealing with fluctuating market environments. At the same time, it integrates the P2P system that allows lenders and borrowers to be automatically connected for better interest costs when dealing with volatile assets like meme coins. The other notable strength that makes Mutuum Finance stand out is its emphasis on risk management and sustainability. The upcoming stablecoin by Mutuum Finance is set to act as a utility-centric foundation within the DeFi platform. Opposite to algorithmic stablecoins, which mostly function through strong market forces, the stablecoin by MUTM is structured on the concept of over-collateralization, which means that the stable value is ensured by the surplus value of the cryptos that have been locked within smart contracts, rather than being based on the credibility of the issuer. Mutuum Finance also takes a strong focus on security and transparency, which has become more and more important in the DeFi sector. The project has also been put through a full independent audit by Halborn Security, with all suggestions implemented before the V1 protocol launch on Sepolia testnet. This focus on security, together with a clear development roadmap that includes testnet launches as well as being mainnet-ready, serves to instill confidence in investors and also establishes Mutuum Finance as a crypto project to keep an eye on. Ripple (XRP) finds itself squeezed by regulations and lacking potential, while Mutuum Finance (MUTM) appears to be the crypto to watch. At only $0.04 during Presale Phase 7 and set to increase past $0.6 post-launch, investors are poised to enjoy potential returns of more than 1000% over initial investment. Having already raised $19.5M, with 18,620 buyers, MUTM has both short-term and long-term momentum and clearly has the makings of one of the next crypto to explode. Investors seeking a promising new crypto have found a compelling opportunity here, as MUTM continues to rise in relevance among those scouting the next crypto to explode.

According to a local report , the Seoul Eastern District Prosecutors’ Office announced on December 30 that 13 members of the syndicate face charges, including criminal organization operation and violations of the Telecommunications Fraud Victims Refund Act, with 11 arrested and two indicted without detention. Operating from Poipet, Cambodia, the organization posed as wealthy young women on messaging platforms, claiming relatives worked alongside Tesla CEO Elon Musk and offering access to lucrative SpaceX investments. Between December 2024 and October 2025, they embezzled 1.93 billion won from victims by using a fabricated SpaceX mobile application designed to intercept investment funds, then converting the proceeds through local criminal networks into Korean won. Source: ChosunBiz Sophisticated Deception Tactics Exploit Investment Appeal The syndicate employed carefully scripted conversations to build trust with targets, gradually introducing investment opportunities tied to SpaceX’s market reputation. Prosecutors discovered the group created a counterfeit SpaceX application that victims were instructed to install, creating the illusion of legitimate transactions while funds flowed directly to the criminal network. “ A relative works with Musk ,” read prepared scripts used to establish credibility before soliciting investments. Beyond the technical infrastructure, investigators uncovered evidence that the organization anticipated law enforcement scrutiny. Members prepared false testimonies claiming they were victims of job scams who were taken to Cambodia under false pretenses and forced into criminal activity through confinement and threats. Conversation transcripts between members and their recruiters revealed a clear awareness that they were committing crimes and intentional efforts to evade accountability. Source: ChosunBiz The joint investigation involving prosecutors, police, and the Korea Immigration Service identified 20 Korean nationals within the organization over the course of eight months. Authorities initially arrested three counselors and one manager between July and September, subsequently apprehending additional recruiters and interpreters. Seven members remain unaccounted for as investigators continue tracking suspects. Romance Scams Represent Growing Threat Across Cryptocurrency Markets This case exemplifies the expanding epidemic of romance scams plaguing cryptocurrency investors globally. In July, a Korean man in his 50s lost over $73,000 after 46 days of daily conversations with a woman claiming to be Japanese, who convinced him to invest in her recommended cryptocurrency exchange. The victim’s initial hesitation dissolved as fabricated profits and successful withdrawals built false confidence, ultimately leading him to invest 105 million won before the scammer vanished after demanding additional payments for supposed tax obligations. Crypto-related romance scams, particularly “ pig butchering ” schemes that combine emotional manipulation with investment fraud, drained an estimated $5.5 billion from victims across approximately 200,000 cases in 2024. These operations increasingly leverage artificial intelligence tools to generate convincing fake identities, with scammers creating deepfake images and videos to sustain deception over extended periods. U.S. authorities seized more than $225 million in crypto tied to such operations in June, while Australian regulators shut down 95 companies linked to pig butchering schemes in April, processing claims exceeding $35.8 million from victims across 14 countries. South Korea’s crypto market, which Chainalysis estimates reached approximately $130 billion in value last year, faces persistent fraud threats despite widespread adoption. Source: Chainalysis In May, Jeju police arrested 25 individuals connected to four criminal organizations that defrauded 48 victims of nearly $540,000 through fake crypto exchanges between June 2023 and April 2025. Back in March, prosecutors also arrested prominent crypto figure Park “Jonbur Kim” on separate fraud charges involving the Artube token, which allegedly caused $179.6 million in investor losses. Expert Guidance: How to Defend Yourself Security experts emphasize that defending against romance scams requires treating user awareness as core infrastructure. “ As code becomes less exploitable, the main attack surface in 2026 will be people, ” Mitchell Amador, CEO of Immunefi, told Crytponews. In another interview with Cryptonews , Navin Gupta, CEO of blockchain analytics platform Crystal, explained the psychological manipulation driving modern fraud schemes. “ Scammers impersonate figures of perceived authority, such as project founders, influencers, or even support staff, to create an illusion of legitimacy. They exploit FOMO by creating time pressure—you’ll miss your chance if you don’t act now. “ How are scammers stealing billions in crypto?

Major lobbying groups are mobilizing substantial resources ahead of the pivotal 2026 midterm elections. This concerted push aims to directly shape the composition of the 119th Congress and the future of digital asset regulation. Consequently, the political landscape for blockchain technology is entering a new, more aggressive phase. Crypto Lobbying Intensifies for 2026 Midterm Elections According to recent reports, organizations like the Coinbase-backed nonprofit Stand with Crypto are dramatically scaling their operations. These groups combine sophisticated lobbying with extensive media campaigns. Their primary goal is to elect federal legislators who support clear, innovation-friendly crypto policies. Already, their efforts show measurable impact. Numerous incoming members of the current Congress have publicly endorsed pro-crypto legislative frameworks. This early success demonstrates the growing political sophistication of the digital asset industry. Furthermore, the industry is building upon momentum from the previous election cycle. The 2024 presidential race saw unprecedented political spending by crypto entities. Now, advocacy is shifting focus to down-ballot races that determine congressional control. This long-term strategy recognizes that lasting regulatory clarity requires broad legislative support. Therefore, the 2026 elections represent a critical inflection point for the entire sector. The Financial Power of Crypto Super PACs The financial muscle behind this political movement remains formidable. Fairshake, a prominent crypto industry Super PAC, continues its active spending. The group has allocated $2.5 million specifically for 2025 special elections. This spending serves as a precursor to a much larger 2026 campaign war chest. Super PACs like Fairshake can raise and spend unlimited funds to advocate for or against political candidates. Their influence often proves decisive in competitive races. Independent Expenditures: These funds typically finance television ads, digital campaigns, and direct mail. Candidate Support: The PAC backs candidates from both major parties who champion clear digital asset rules. Strategic Focus: Spending targets key swing districts and states where a single seat can shift legislative power. This sustained financial commitment signals that the crypto industry views political engagement as a permanent necessity. It is not a short-term tactic but a core component of its growth strategy in the United States. Expert Analysis on Legislative Implications Policy analysts emphasize the high stakes of the 2026 election outcome. The November 2026 vote will determine all 435 seats in the House of Representatives and 33 seats in the Senate. The resulting partisan balance will directly control the legislative agenda. For instance, a Democratic majority in either chamber could create a significant check on policy initiatives from President Donald Trump’s administration. This dynamic makes the midterms a proxy battle for the direction of U.S. financial technology regulation. Historically, comprehensive crypto legislation has stalled due to partisan disagreements and committee jurisdictional disputes. A Congress more favorably inclined toward the industry could break this logjam. Potential outcomes include bills establishing federal oversight for stablecoins or defining regulatory roles for the SEC and CFTC. Conversely, a Congress hostile to crypto could pursue stricter enforcement and restrictive laws. Therefore, the lobbying surge aims to secure a legislative environment conducive to innovation and consumer protection. Background and Context of Digital Asset Advocacy The current lobbying expansion did not emerge in a vacuum. It follows years of regulatory uncertainty and high-profile legal challenges against major crypto firms. The industry argues that the United States risks falling behind other global jurisdictions with clearer rules. Nations like the United Kingdom, the European Union with its MiCA framework, and Singapore are advancing comprehensive regimes. U.S. advocates contend that proactive legislation is essential for maintaining economic competitiveness and leadership in financial technology. Moreover, voter demographics play a crucial role. Cryptocurrency ownership and interest are notably high among younger, tech-savvy voters. This makes crypto policy a potentially motivating issue in key electoral districts. Lobbying groups are leveraging this grassroots support. Stand with Crypto, for example, claims a large membership base that contacts legislators directly. This combination of “air cover” from paid advertising and “ground game” from constituent outreach represents a modern political advocacy model. Key Crypto Advocacy Groups and 2025-2026 Focus Organization Type Primary 2025-2026 Action Stand with Crypto Nonprofit Advocacy Grassroots mobilization, media campaigns, and direct lobbying for pro-crypto candidates. Fairshake Super PAC Spending millions on independent expenditures in special and midterm elections. The Blockchain Association Industry Trade Group Policy development, congressional testimony, and regulatory advocacy. Crypto Council for Innovation Global Alliance Research, education, and high-level advocacy to promote regulatory clarity. Conclusion The expansion of US crypto lobbying for the 2026 midterm elections marks a decisive moment for the industry’s political evolution. Groups are deploying significant financial resources and grassroots networks to influence congressional races. The outcome will profoundly impact the trajectory of cryptocurrency legislation and the United States’ role in the global digital economy. As a result, the intersection of blockchain technology and American politics will remain a critical area to watch through 2026 and beyond. FAQs Q1: What is the main goal of crypto lobbying groups for the 2026 elections? The primary goal is to elect members of Congress who support clear, innovation-friendly cryptocurrency legislation, thereby shaping the regulatory landscape for digital assets. Q2: How much is the Fairshake Super PAC spending in 2025? Fairshake has committed $2.5 million to support pro-crypto candidates in the 2025 special elections, ahead of a larger expected spend for the 2026 midterms. Q3: Why are the 2026 midterm elections so important for crypto policy? These elections will determine control of both the House and Senate. The partisan balance in Congress directly controls whether pro-crypto legislation can advance or be blocked. Q4: What is Stand with Crypto? Stand with Crypto is a nonprofit advocacy group backed by Coinbase. It focuses on grassroots mobilization and media campaigns to build political support for the cryptocurrency ecosystem. Q5: Could a Democratic majority in Congress affect crypto legislation under President Trump? Yes, analysts note that if the Democratic Party gains a majority in either chamber, it could significantly constrain the advancement of crypto legislation proposed by the Trump administration, leading to potential gridlock.

According to Mark, his prediction/warning is tied to what he sees as continued job market weakness, shaky inflation signals, and direct political pressure. Unlike Wall Street and Fed officials, who expect a slow pace, Mark believes the central bank will be forced to act faster.“Behind the decision to ease monetary policy further will be the still flagging job market, particularly in the early part of 2026,” he wrote. Companies, Mark says, won’t rush to hire. They’re still spooked by recent changes in trade and immigration policy and want stability before adding to payrolls. Unemployment rise and weak hiring pace trigger early cuts According to Mark, businesses are dragging their feet on hiring, which means job growth will stay soft.That keeps unemployment climbing, and that puts pressure on the Fed. “Until then, job growth will remain insufficient to forestall further increases in unemployment, and as long as unemployment is on the rise, the Fed will cut rates,” he wrote. This view is far ahead of market expectations, which are only pricing in two cuts, one possibly in April, the second likely around September. That’s according to CME FedWatch data, which tracks rate predictions from futures traders. Mark isn’t buying that timeline. He sees rate cuts coming much earlier and more frequently. Fed officials themselves are even more cautious. Their latest dot plot, the grid of where each policymaker sees rates heading, only shows one rate cut for all of 2026. And even that one wasn’t a strong consensus. December’s FOMC minutes revealed that the cut was a close call. Members admitted they might ease more later, but not by much. That’s not fast enough for Mark, who sees too many warning signs flashing red. Trump’s control of Fed appointments adds more pressure One reason Mark sees urgency is politics. President Donald Trump, back in the White House, is already reshaping the Federal Reserve’s leadership. Right now, three of the seven sitting Fed governors (Christopher Waller, Michelle Bowman, and Stephen Miran) are Trump appointees. With Miran’s term ending in January, Trump will soon get to pick another. It doesn’t stop there. Jerome Powell’s time as Fed chair ends in May, even though his governor term runs through 2028. Trump is likely to pick someone who shares his low-rate agenda. He’s also reportedly trying to oust Governor Lisa Cook, although courts are blocking that attempt, for now. Mark warns that this lineup gives Trump major influence. “Trump will also pressure for lower interest rates. Federal Reserve independence will steadily erode as the president appoints more members to the Federal Open Market Committee, including the Fed chair in May,” he said. With midterm elections coming, the push for lower rates could get louder. Trump wants to show economic growth, and that means more pressure on the Fed. The next FOMC meeting is set for Jan. 27–28, but traders only see a 13.8% chance of a cut then, based on CME data. That may change fast if Mark is right. Don’t just read crypto news. Understand it.

Ethereum-based stablecoins showed activity signaling a cycle peak, far surpassing previous activity spikes. Stablecoins on Ethereum reached peak activity at the end of 2025. Activity levels at the end of the year were not an anomaly; instead, they extended a trend of steep growth over the past few months. Active addresses moved to new record levels on several occasions in 2025. In the past days of 2025, around 593K daily active users moved stablecoins. The year saw stablecoins behave in ways not seen during previous market cycles, both in terms of total supply and the scale of usage. Over $314B in stablecoins was in circulation in 2025, with much more diverse destinations compared to previous market cycles. During the early 2022 market peak, active stablecoin addresses reached 285K per day, the highest for the entire expansion cycle. Stablecoins remained active even below market price records Crypto valuations at the end of 2025 have deflated below their peak levels, while stablecoin users retained the high activity levels. Ethereum activity shows a structural shift in digital asset activity, independent of the BTC and ETH price cycle. Stablecoins have multiple use cases, including arbitrage, P2P movements, lending, and settlements between whales or even institutions. During previous cycles, spikes in stablecoin activity were short-lived, while the activity in 2025 remained at a high baseline, with sustained growth. Stablecoin transfers became one of the key avenues for positioning capital. The high activity may also signal repositioning, seeking out the best venues of liquidity. Stablecoins were used as lending collateral, DEX trading pairs, and other active allocations, instead of being used to park value. The availability of yield also greatly expanded stablecoin turnover. During past crypto cycles, high stablecoin activity signaled accumulation rather than distribution. Despite the slide of BTC from its highs, stablecoin activity showed the market was still searching for opportunities. Ethereum becomes a high-value stablecoin hub Ethereum became a hub for high-value transfers, with USDT and USDC among the top 5 smart contracts on the network. Stablecoins were also among the chief reasons for Ethereum’s recent transaction record, as Cryptopolitan reported . The top three stablecoins on Ethereum remain USDT, USDC, and DAI, the legacy stablecoin of the Sky ecosystem. In the past year, USDC expanded its influence on value transfers, carrying the bulk of value on Ethereum, despite having a lower transaction count. | Source: Dune Analytics USDT has a 54.77% dominance, with around 37% for USDC based on transaction levels. Both tokens expanded their transaction activity at a near-exponential rate in the last months of 2025. However, USDC is becoming the value leader, carrying higher volumes despite having lower activity. The prevalence of USDC transfers for high-value activities shows another shift in 2025. Over the past 12 months, USDC activity increased, as traders shifted to the fully regulated and accepted token. USDC can be used with no restrictions by US and European traders, while USDT retains its international role outside those markets.

Faryar Shirzad, Coinbase’s chief policy officer, raised the concern in a post on X, arguing that restrictions around rewards could reduce the appeal of dollar-backed stablecoins overseas.

Shirzad pointed directly to China’s latest moves on its central bank digital currency, the digital yuan, as an example of how fast the global environment is changing. As China Sweetens Digital Yuan, Coinbase Questions U.S. Stablecoin Limits Earlier this week, the People’s Bank of China unveiled a framework that will allow commercial banks to pay interest on balances held in digital yuan wallets starting January 1, 2026. China's PBOC has rolled out digital yuan action plan for the upcoming year, to enhance the CBDC's management and financial infrastructure. #PBOC #DigitalYuan #ChinaCBDC https://t.co/sKEBAfgcve — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) December 29, 2025 Lu Lei, a deputy governor at the PBOC, said the change would shift the e-CNY beyond its original role as a digital version of cash and integrate it into banks’ asset and liability operations. In the United States, the discussion is unfolding against the backdrop of the GENIUS Act, signed into law in July as the country’s first comprehensive stablecoin framework. A provision in GENIUS Act aims to curb the influence of tech conglomerates and major financial institutions in the US stablecoin market. #GENIUS #Stablecoins https://t.co/IE7FZdWjXw — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) July 21, 2025 The legislation set reserve and compliance standards for issuers and barred them from paying direct interest while still allowing platforms and third parties to offer rewards tied to stablecoin usage. Shirzad warned that changes during Senate negotiations on a broader market structure bill could tip the balance further, potentially giving non-US stablecoins and CBDCs a competitive edge. Industry observers say pressure to revisit the law is coming from traditional banking interests. Crypto policy commentator Max Avery said banks, which currently earn roughly 4% on reserves held at the Federal Reserve, have little incentive to see that yield shared more widely. Stablecoin platforms, by contrast, have argued that passing some of that return to users through rewards is part of what makes the products attractive. China Pushes More on Digital Yuan Growth as Private Apps Still Dominate China continues to develop its CBDC despite banning cryptocurrency trading and stablecoins domestically. Its latest action plan, covering 2026 to 2030, seeks to expand national usage of the digital yuan and build out supporting infrastructure. By November 2025, the e-CNY had processed 3.48 billion transactions worth 16.7 trillion yuan, or about $2.34 trillion, across 230 million personal wallets and nearly 19 million corporate wallets. The introduction of interest-bearing digital yuan wallets is widely seen as an attempt to address long-standing complaints. Adoption has lagged behind private payment platforms such as Alipay and WeChat Pay, which together control more than 90% of China’s mobile payments market. Users have cited a lack of incentives and ongoing privacy concerns as reasons for sticking with existing apps, despite years of pilot programs. The policy has already triggered a surge in market activity, with Chinese investors pouring more than $188 million into digital yuan-related stocks following the announcement.

According to a comprehensive analysis by The Block, which compiled forecasts from multiple sector leaders, the twin engines of regulatory clarity and on-chain infrastructure are poised to define the next major phase of growth and integration. This forecast, published in late 2024, provides a crucial roadmap for investors, developers, and institutions navigating the complex web3 ecosystem. The Dual Pillars: Regulatory Clarity and On-Chain Infrastructure The cryptocurrency sector has historically navigated a patchwork of global regulations. Consequently, experts now argue that definitive legal frameworks will serve as the primary catalyst for the 2026 market. Simultaneously, the underlying technology must mature. Specifically, robust on-chain infrastructure is essential for supporting scalable, secure, and user-friendly applications. These elements are deeply interconnected; clear rules provide the safety for infrastructure to be built, while advanced infrastructure enables compliance with those very rules. The Regulatory Turning Point Hoolie Tejwani, Head of Coinbase Ventures, provides a clear perspective on this dynamic. He predicts that 2026 will mark a turning point where coherent market regulations finally unlock mass crypto adoption. Furthermore, this clarity empowers founders to build responsibly within known parameters. It also significantly boosts investor confidence, potentially directing substantial institutional capital into the space. The current regulatory ambiguity often stifles innovation and deters traditional finance players. Therefore, a shift towards predictable rules could reshape the entire investment landscape. Building the Next Internet: The On-Chain Evolution Parallel to regulatory developments, a technological revolution is underway. Keith Grose, CEO of Coinbase UK, asserts that the next generation of the internet is being constructed directly on-chain. This vision extends far beyond simple payments. Key layers for identity, settlement, and verification are currently undergoing significant strengthening. For instance, decentralized identity solutions could replace cumbersome login systems. Moreover, instant settlement layers eliminate traditional finance delays. These improvements collectively create a more efficient and user-sovereign digital experience. Programmable Regulation and Jurisdiction-Aware Systems An innovative convergence of these two drivers is also on the horizon. Alex Gluchowski, CEO of Matter Labs, introduces the concept of programmable regulation . He envisions the emergence of jurisdiction-aware rollups and smart contracts. These systems could automatically apply regional legal rules directly within their code. For example, a decentralized application (dApp) could dynamically adjust its functions based on a user’s geographic location and the corresponding regulations. This technological compliance layer could reduce legal overhead and create truly global yet locally compliant platforms.

On-Chain Infrastructure Keith Grose (Coinbase UK) Builds the foundation for the next-generation, user-centric internet. Programmable Regulation Alex Gluchowski (Matter Labs) Automates compliance through jurisdiction-aware blockchain layers. Real-World Asset Tokenization Paolo Ardoino (Bitfinex) Mainstreams blockchain for capital raising and institutional operations. Tokenization and Institutional Integration The maturation of infrastructure directly enables another critical trend: the tokenization of real-world assets (RWA). Paolo Ardoino, CTO of Bitfinex, observes that tokenization is rapidly transitioning from a niche experiment to a mainstream method for capital raising. The improved efficiency, transparency, and liquidity of tokenized assets are compelling arguments for traditional finance. As a result, institutions are beginning to integrate blockchain technology into their core operational frameworks. This integration moves beyond mere treasury diversification to fundamentally reengineer processes like: Securities issuance and trading : Faster settlement and reduced counterparty risk. Supply chain finance : Transparent tracking of goods and automated payments. Cross-border payments : Lower costs and immediate transaction finality. The Rise of the AI-Crypto Nexus Beyond finance, a new synergistic sector is gaining immense traction. Crypto asset manager Hashdex provides a bold quantitative forecast. They estimate the AI-crypto sector’s market size will reach a staggering $10 billion by 2026. This growth is not based on speculation but on tangible, converging technological needs. Several key areas are driving this convergence: Decentralized Computing : Blockchain networks can provide verifiable, distributed computing power for AI training, challenging centralized cloud monopolies. Data Provenance Verification : On-chain systems can cryptographically attest to the origin and integrity of data used to train AI models, addressing critical concerns about bias and misinformation. AI-to-AI Coordination : As autonomous AI agents proliferate, crypto-economic mechanisms and smart contracts will be essential for facilitating trustless interaction and value exchange between them. This intersection represents a profound shift. It positions blockchain not just as a financial tool but as critical infrastructure for the responsible development and deployment of artificial intelligence. The Path Forward: A Synthesis of Code and Law The expert forecasts for 2026 paint a picture of a market entering a new era of maturity. The journey involves a complex synthesis. Legal frameworks must evolve to understand and nurture technological innovation. Conversely, blockchain developers must proactively build systems that prioritize security, transparency, and compliance. The timeline from now to 2026 will likely see increased pilot programs, regulatory sandboxes, and public-private partnerships. These initiatives will test the boundaries of what is possible when code and law work in concert. Conclusion The collective insight from industry leaders defines a clear trajectory for the 2026 cryptocurrency landscape. The primary 2026 crypto drivers are unequivocally regulatory clarity and sophisticated on-chain infrastructure. These forces will unlock institutional adoption, fuel the tokenization of global assets, and create the foundation for a new internet. Furthermore, the explosive growth of the AI-crypto sector highlights blockchain’s expanding role beyond finance. The coming years will therefore test the ecosystem’s ability to build responsibly within evolving frameworks, ultimately determining the pace and scale of mainstream integration. FAQs Q1: What is the most important factor for crypto growth in 2026 according to experts? Industry experts consistently highlight regulatory clarity as the most critical factor. Clear and coherent regulations will provide the certainty needed for institutions to invest and for projects to build compliant, sustainable businesses. Q2: How does on-chain infrastructure support wider crypto adoption? Robust on-chain infrastructure improves scalability, security, and user experience. It enables faster transactions, cheaper fees, and more complex applications like decentralized identity and verifiable data systems, making blockchain technology practical for everyday use and enterprise integration. Q3: What does “programmable regulation” mean in a crypto context? Programmable regulation refers to the concept of encoding legal and compliance rules directly into blockchain protocols or smart contracts. For example, a “jurisdiction-aware rollup” could automatically enforce region-specific financial regulations, allowing a single platform to operate globally while adhering to local laws. Q4: Why is the AI-crypto sector expected to grow so significantly? The AI and crypto sectors have synergistic needs. Blockchain provides solutions for decentralized computing power, verifiable data provenance for AI training, and economic systems for AI agents to interact. This convergence addresses core challenges in both fields, creating a substantial new market opportunity. Q5: How will tokenization impact traditional finance by 2026? Tokenization is expected to move into the mainstream for capital raising and asset management. It promises to increase efficiency, liquidity, and transparency for traditional assets like stocks, bonds, and real estate, prompting institutions to integrate blockchain technology into their core operational backbones.

Binance Coin price analysis gives bullish prediction as the current market sentiment improves. The coin’s price also increased to $861.3 as buying interest surged once again. If traders continue buying, the BNB price might see a further increase and break above $877. On the other hand, a failure in attracting buying demand might result in a correction. In such a case, the price of BNB might head toward the immediate support at $847. Is BNB a good investment? Considering the recent price moves, purchasing Binance coins and holding them for an extended period could yield significant returns. From a five-year plan standpoint, it is projected to see a large increase, possibly rising above $8,519.96 in 2031. However, financial choices shouldn’t be made exclusively based on our data. Why is BNB up? BNB found support, and the price moved toward $861.3, as bulls target $877. Moreover, the cryptocurrency has gained up to 0.2 percent of its value if looked at from an overall view. Will BNB reach $1000? The BNB price has already crossed $1000 in 2025, and buyers are holding strong to maintain the price above that level. Will BNB reach $2000? Currently, BNB is feeling pressure from legal challenges around its ecosystem. However, as these issues are settled by next year, the coin’s price is expected to start a bull run. As per the Binance coin price prediction , BNB will reach $2000 at the start of 2026. Will BNB reach $3000? Binance allows users to save up to 25% on spot margin trading fees by using BNB. Another factor is that users can save up to 10% on futures trading expenditures with the token, which makes the Binance platform a primary choice. Binance also uses a significant portion of its earnings to buy back BNB, which supports the Binance ecosystem. The burning process also decreases the token supply and increases demand, which is expected to increase in value above $3000 by the end of 2026, according to the Binance coin price prediction. Does BNB have a good long-term future? All cryptocurrencies involve risks and uncertainties. However, BNB has a strong market position and a management team that runs the world’s largest cryptocurrency exchange. BNB has the potential for increased utility and is expected to retain a strong position in the cryptocurrency sphere. Binance coin price prediction suggests that holding it for the long haul is a good option, with tenfold expected returns in five years and the price reaching $8,519.96 by 2031. However, one must conduct his/her own research or seek professional financial advice.

Binance Coin historic price sentiment Binance Coin (BNB) was launched in July 2017 through an Initial Coin Offering (ICO), with an initial price of around $0.10, according to historical crypto market data. As a utility token for the Binance cryptocurrency exchange, it offered users reduced trading fees. In late 2017, BNB’s price significantly increased and reached its first major peak in January 2018, hitting approximately $24. However, it experienced a decline following the broader market correction. BNB price history | Coingecko Throughout 2018 and 2019, BNB’s price experienced gradual growth as the BNB market soared. In 2018, BNB traded near $13 for most of the year but dropped to $5 by December. However, BNB reached above $30 in June 2019. Despite the global economic uncertainty caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, BNB maintained relative stability and saw an upward trend in 2020. Due to the growing popularity of Binance as an exchange and the expansion of its ecosystem, the coin touched the $34 range in November 2020. BNB experienced a significant bull run in early 2021, reaching a high above $600 in May 2021. Positive market sentiment helped improve its market cap, which remained at an all-time high until recently. Binance Coin’s price dynamics in 2022 were characterized by volatility and were influenced by a combination of macroeconomic factors and regulatory developments around the Binance exchange, which led to a bearish scenario. This took BNB to less than $220 in June and an average price of $250 in December. BNB remained a significant player in the cryptocurrency market in 2023, recovering to about $350 in April. However, it soon lost momentum, reaching about $205 in October. In late December, BNB climbed back to about $325. At the beginning of 2024, Binance Coin (BNB) traded near $300, surged to an all-time high of $717.48 in June, fluctuated between $488 and $661 through the year, and closed December at $700.3. In January 2025, BNB maintained an average price of $697, but it decreased to $589 by the end of February. BNB traded near the psychological mark of $600 in March and April 2025, and it reached above $650 in May, while it marked a new ATH of $858.34 on July 28. In August, BNB broke its own record and discovered several new all-time highs when BNB increased to $899.77 on August 22, showing significant growth. On September 21, BNB reached the $1,079.07 mark. In October, it hit a new all-time high (ATH) of $1,369.99 and is trading near the $1,100 mark in November. By the end of November, the price of BNB declined below $800. In early December, BNB price triggered a strong bull run toward $900.",Crypto Price Predictions|Binance|BNB,EN,0,0,EXCHANGE|MARKET|REGULATION|TRADING|BNB|TOKEN SALE|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-12-31 19:00:00

Instead of unveiling a price-focused catalyst, the project has chosen to confront recent setbacks head-on, outlining a plan built around responsibility, user restitution, and a tighter operational focus. The announcement, which came from SHIB developer Kaal Dhairya, follows months of uncertainty tied to security issues within the Shibarium ecosystem and an unfavorable price action for Shiba Inu. Shiba Inu Team Addresses A Turbulent Year In a message to the community, Shiba Inu developer Kaal Dhairya addressed a few things that happened in the Shiba Inu ecosystem this year. Notably, Dhairya described 2025 as one of the most challenging periods that the ecosystem has faced. The most notable event was the exploit connected to Shibarium’s Plasma Bridge, as this exposed vulnerabilities in the Shiba Inu ecosystem and forced difficult conversations around trust and governance. Related Reading: Shiba Inu End Of Year Predictions Remain Bearish, High Volatility Expected According to Dhairya, this episode was the moment that demanded openness and corrective action, setting the tone for what would follow. Interestingly, Dhairya confirmed that leadership figures who were expected to guide the team through the crisis exited without accountability, leaving a smaller core team to handle recovery efforts. He also addressed accusations circulating within the community, including claims that authorities were never engaged. He stated he was interviewed by multiple federal agents and handed over all available intelligence gathered during and after the incident. Dhairya also dismissed requests for public complaint IDs , describing them as pressure tactics from opportunistic actors, noting that the official process is active even if it is not publicly documented. The update also provides a detailed snapshot of where Shibarium stands from a technical perspective. Core recovery work has largely been completed, with the Plasma Bridge back online under stricter safeguards. Beyond patching vulnerabilities, he also confirmed structural changes aimed at deeper decentralization, one of such being the bridge being decoupled from validators. Final Play For 2025 The centerpiece of the final 2025 play is the introduction of “Shib Owes You,” or SOU. Every affected user in the $4 million Shibarium bridge exploit in September is going to be assigned an SOU NFT that records the exact amount owed to them and creates a permanent and verifiable claim. These NFTs update dynamically as payouts or community donations continue, allowing users to track progress toward being made whole in real time. These SOUs can be merged, split, and transferred for quick liquidity. The announcement makes clear that in order for SOUs to function, revenue discipline is no longer optional. Projects, platforms, and custodians benefiting from the Shib ecosystem resources are expected to contribute back as an obligation tied to accountability. To make this a reality, hard decisions will be made. Legacy systems that no longer serve the ecosystem’s future could be merged or retired.",Shiba Inu|Kaal Dhairya|Plasma Bridge|shib|SHIB news|Shib Owes You|SHIB price|Shiba Inu ecosystem|Shiba Inu news|Shiba Inu price|Shibarium|SHIBUSD|SHIBUSDT|SOU|SOU NFT,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|SHIB|TRADING|CRYPTOCURRENCY|SECURITY INCIDENTS,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-12-31 19:00:44

Here’s why,https://timestabloid.com/xrp-is-the-momentum-king-right-now-heres-why/,"Recent fund flow data shared by crypto analyst and investor Xaif Crypto points to a notable divergence in institutional positioning across major digital assets, including Bitcoin, Ethereum, and XRP. The figures, sourced from CoinShares and covering the most recent reporting period, indicate that XRP recorded the strongest weekly inflows among tracked assets, unlike Bitcoin and Ethereum , which experienced substantial capital withdrawals. The data presents a snapshot of how institutional allocations are adjusting as the year approaches its close, highlighting a growing preference for select assets rather than broad-based exposure. $XRP is the momentum king right now. Weekly inflows: $XRP → +$70.2M $SOL → +$7.5M Outflows: $BTC → –$443M $ETH → –$59.3M While $BTC and $ETH bleed, XRP stands alone dominating institutional rotation. https://t.co/jCzHZ1Gmgi pic.twitter.com/nnAwDqIDsX — Xaif Crypto | (@Xaif_Crypto) December 29, 2025 XRP Posts Strong Weekly Inflows According to the reported figures, XRP attracted approximately $70.2 million in weekly inflows, placing it well ahead of other major assets during the same period. This performance contrasts sharply with the broader market trend, where most large-cap assets saw either muted interest or outright outflows. Solana , the next closest performer every week, recorded inflows of around $7.5 million, a fraction of the capital directed into XRP-based products. The data suggests that XRP captured a disproportionate share of new institutional allocations over the week under review. Month-to-date figures further reinforce this positioning, with XRP showing significant cumulative inflows compared to many peers. Year-to-date data also place XRP among the stronger performers in terms of sustained capital attraction, reflecting consistency rather than a single isolated spike. Bitcoin and Ethereum Face Heavy Withdrawals In contrast, Bitcoin products recorded weekly outflows of roughly $443 million, making it the largest source of capital withdrawals in the dataset. Ethereum followed a similar, though less severe, pattern with weekly outflows of approximately $59.3 million. These movements indicate a reduction in exposure to the two largest digital assets by market capitalization, at least within institutional investment vehicles tracked by CoinShares. The broader context of the data shows that these outflows occurred despite Bitcoin and Ethereum maintaining dominant positions in total assets under management. This suggests that the activity reflects portfolio rebalancing rather than a wholesale exit from the digital asset market. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Implications of Institutional Rotation Xaif Crypto’s assessment frames XRP as the primary beneficiary of this short-term rotation in institutional capital. While Bitcoin and Ethereum saw capital reductions, XRP stood out as the only major asset registering sizable positive flows every week. The contrast underscores a selective approach by institutional participants, who appear to be reallocating funds rather than withdrawing from the asset class entirely. Overall, the CoinShares data illustrates a market environment where capital is being redistributed toward assets demonstrating relative strength in institutional demand.

The coin-exchange and crypto kiosk operator, owned by Apollo Global Management, has agreed to a surprise sale that triggers a full bond repayment next month. According to Bloomberg, people familiar with the matter allegedly say the buyer is tied to Alaska Native investments from the far north of the state. The transaction has not been made public before. The buyer is Arctic Slope Regional, a company created in 1972 after a US government settlement with Indigenous residents of Alaska. Debt repayment clears path as Alaska Native company takes control As part of the takeover, the new owner will repay more than $750 million in principal, plus all accrued interest, in early January. A private notice sent to bondholders confirmed the timeline, according to Bloomberg. The bonds involved in the Coinstar deal are structured as whole business securitizations, meaning they are backed by the full cash flow of the exchange. Some analysts later worried the debt might need another overhaul if pressure on Coinstar’s business continued, but the planned repayment reportedly removes that risk. Arctic Slope Regional (ASRC) oversees a wide mix of portfolios that include construction, petroleum refining, and government contract services, based on information published by the company. ASRC is one of roughly a dozen regional corporations formed under the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act, passed in the early 1970s, which granted millions of acres of land and $1 billion in compensation to Alaska Native groups in exchange for land claims. Coinstar entered Apollo’s portfolio in 2016, running over 24,000 kiosks that let users turn loose change into cash. After the pandemic slowdown, Coinstar pushed deeper into digital assets. Last year, it began letting customers use cash to buy cryptocurrency through kiosks or a mobile app. The sale now hands control of Coinstar to an Alaska-based owner while closing the book on its bond debt.

In fact, blockchain tracker Lookonchain found that the company bought another 32,938 ETH, worth about $97.6 million. Ethereum Stockpile The data also shows BitMine staked an additional 118,944 ETH, which is roughly $352 million. The purchases were executed over a four-hour window on Tuesday and come as crypto markets remain subdued in the final stretch of 2025. The company appears to be using year-end softness to scale its Ethereum treasury and deepen its long-term exposure to the network. BitMine’s latest acquisition brings its total Ether holdings to around 4.07 million ETH, which is valued at approximately $12 billion at current prices. The company has consistently staked a large portion of its reserves. The buying spree took place amid BitMine chairman Thomas “Tom” Lee’s statement that activity tends to slow as the market enters the final holiday weeks of a calendar year. Lee also noted that BitMine added more than 44,000 ETH over the past week alone and has accumulated over 77,400 токенс since last Monday. He has repeatedly described the firm as the largest “fresh money” buyer of Ether in the world, while highlighting that BitMine has purchased more than 40,000 ETH per week for at least ten consecutive weeks. Lee said, “Bitmine’s sole focus remains creating stockholder value, achieving this by accretively acquiring ETH per share, optimizing yield and income on its Ether holdings, and strategically investing the balance sheet on ‘moonshots’ and leveraging the company’s strong community and market position to generate additional returns.” Institutional Flows and Technical Signals Alongside corporate accumulation, institutional interest in Ethereum has also shown signs of strength. Data from Tuesday shows net inflows of about $67.9 million into spot ETH ETFs. Interestingly, Grayscale accounted for almost $64.2 million of that total. Additionally, market watchers tracking ETH’s performance against BTC observed that longer-term indicators have begun to turn more constructive. Galaxy Trading points to improving momentum on higher timeframes, which means that Ethereum’s relative positioning versus Bitcoin may be stabilizing after a long period of weakness.

Image source: TradingView If bulls cannot initiate a surge, the TIA price may drop below the immediate support line at $0.4409, resulting in a correction to $0.4079. Is TIA a good investment? Celestia and modular rollups enhance Ethereum ‘s performance and expansion, impacting the competition among L1 public chains. Public chains like BNB Chain and Celo opt to integrate with Ethereum as L2 Rollups due to liquidity and cost advantages. Celestia’s scalability and user-friendly design make it an appealing choice for developers, offering additional scalability to the blockchain ecosystem. Why is the TIA price down today? TIA’s price is attempting to hold around $0.453 as buyers lose confidence, resulting in a downward push. Will the TIA price reach $100? Depending on the current market sentiment and buying demand, we might see TIA’s price touching the $100 milestone in the coming years. According to our prediction, the TIA price might hit the $100 mark in 2030. Will the TIA price reach $1,000? If the altcoin market remains robust in the coming years and Celestia develops more user-friendly utilities, its price might surpass $1K. Is TIA a good long-term investment? Yes, TIA is a good long-term investment option. As buyers’ interest grows and the network expands, we might see profitable returns. It is advised to do your own research and conduct investment advice before investing in the volatile crypto market. Recent news/opinions on TIA Ethereum’s Fusaka upgrade introduced PeerDAS, increasing data availability capacity to 10–15 blobs per block, compared with Celestia’s roughly 1,600 blobs per day. This challenges Celestia’s modular DA narrative as Ethereum now supports more than 55 rollups and over $40 billion in total value locked. Celestia price prediction December 2025 Celestia’s price is declining following the market crash in October. As a result, we expect the TIA price to record a minimum of $0.5 and a maximum of $1.3, with an average of $0.9 in December. Celestia Price Prediction Potential Low Potential Average Potential High Celestia Price Prediction December 2025 $0.5 $0.9 $1.3 Celestia price prediction 2025 Historically, the full impact of a Bitcoin Halving isn’t felt until about a year to a year and a half afterward. This suggests that new all-time highs for Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies might occur around 2025. Considering this, along with the ongoing development of the Celestia network and the growing adoption of modular blockchain technology, the outlook appears positive for the year ahead. Based on a deep technical analysis of past TIA price data, the price of Celestia is predicted to reach a minimum level of $1, a potential maximum of $1.5, and an average trading price of $1.3 in 2025.

Analysts Reveal What To Expect,https://www.newsbtc.com/news/dogecoin/dogecoin-price-reach-1-2026/,"As 2025 comes to an end, many traders and analysts are looking at how the Dogecoin price can perform in 2026. The year began with optimism, but momentum has faded over time, leaving the meme coin under pressure as it heads into the new year. The question now is whether 2026 could be the year Dogecoin finally sees momentum strong enough to push its price action to the anticipated $1 level, or whether that price target will still be out of reach. Dogecoin Stuck In A Tight Range, Bold Bullish Targets Emerge What stands out in recent Dogecoin discussions is the contrast between short-term caution and long-term optimism. Several analysts are watching the meme coin from very different angles, combining near-term technical conditions with historical precedent and cycle behavior. Their outlooks paint a wide range of possible outcomes, from continued consolidation to scenarios of dramatic rallies. Related Reading: What Happens If The Bitcoin Price Closes 2025 In The Red? Analyst Answers For instance, Crypto analyst Surya, who has been tracking Dogecoin’s lower-timeframe structure as the year winds down, noted that its price is currently compressed inside a falling wedge formation. Dogecoin has repeatedly failed to reclaim the $0.127 to $0.130 zone, which he views as the key area separating simple consolidation from a genuine trend shift. As long as the price stays below that range, then Dogecoin has yet to confirm a directional move. The lower boundary of the structure sits closer to the mid-$0.11 region, which has acted as short-term support during recent pullbacks. Surya’s chart shows momentum indicators diverging positively while price is pushing upwards to the wedge apex. Dogecoin Price Chart. Source: @suryapro on X From his perspective, acceptance above $0.13 would shift the structure decisively bullish and open the door to higher levels, where he projected a move above $0.165 in the first few days of 2026. However, continued rejection would keep Dogecoin trapped between support and resistance into early 2026. On the more extreme end of expectations, Ahmet Nizam outlined a scenario that leans heavily on Dogecoin’s history of strong momentum rallies. His projection suggests that if market conditions turn strongly bullish, Dogecoin could repeat the behavior seen in early 2021, when the price surged more than 34,900% in the first half of the year. His chart projection maps out a move starting from the $0.12 region into multi-dollar territory, with an extended target reaching as high as $57. Dogecoin Price Chart. Source: @NizamiAhmet1 on X Another outlook focuses on a developing double bottom visible on Dogecoin’s higher-timeframe chart, as highlighted by Trader Tardigrade. Dogecoin appears to be forming a base around $0.10 to $0.12. This recent low looks much like earlier cycle bottoms in 2023 and 2024, where Dogecoin formed rounded structures before a strong rally. In terms of a playout, Trader Tardigrade’s projection envisions a gradual transition from accumulation into a launch phase that will eventually culminate into a breakout above $1 in 2026.

Source: @TATrader_Alan on X What The Outlook Means For Dogecoin In 2026 Taken together, these perspectives show the sentiment surrounding Dogecoin’s outlook as it heads into a new year. Short-term charts show a cryptocurrency still searching for direction, while longer-term projections range from measured recoveries to at least $1 in 2026. Dogecoin is currently trading around $0.123. Reaching $1 in 2026 would demand an increase of about 710% from current levels, but history shows that Dogecoin has delivered such unexpected outcomes before.

This ruling, originating from the Northern District of Texas, represents a significant legal benchmark for defining the boundaries of promotional liability in the volatile cryptocurrency sector. Mark Cuban Lawsuit Dismissed: The Core Legal Decision The court’s order rejected all claims against Cuban and the Mavericks organization. Plaintiffs had alleged violations of Texas securities laws and state consumer protection statutes. According to the filing reviewed by The Block, the judge found the plaintiffs’ arguments insufficient to proceed. Consequently, the court granted the motion to dismiss with prejudice, barring the refiling of the same claims. Cuban’s legal team immediately highlighted the decision’s clarity, stating it affirmed their position that the promotional activities did not constitute securities fraud. Anatomy of the Voyager Digital Promotion To understand the lawsuit’s context, one must examine the partnership between Voyager Digital and the Dallas Mavericks. The promotion, active during the 2021-2022 NBA season, offered incentives like deposit bonuses for fans using the Voyager platform. Mark Cuban, a visible and vocal cryptocurrency advocate, publicly endorsed the platform on social media and in interviews. However, Voyager filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in July 2022, freezing customer assets and triggering widespread losses. The plaintiffs argued this promotional campaign materially contributed to their financial damages. Legal Precedents and the ‘Howey Test’ Central to the dismissal was the application of securities law. For a promotion to violate securities statutes, the promoted asset must qualify as a security under the Howey Test . This test, established by the Supreme Court, defines an investment contract. Legal experts note that the court likely determined that general platform promotion, rather than the sale of a specific token, did not meet this stringent legal threshold. This distinction between promoting a service and offering a security is crucial for future cases. Key Timeline: Voyager, Mavericks, and the Lawsuit Date Event 2021 Dallas Mavericks and Voyager Digital announce promotional partnership. July 2022 Voyager Digital suspends withdrawals and files for bankruptcy. Late 2022 Investors file class-action lawsuit against Mark Cuban and the Mavericks. 2023-2024 Legal motions and briefs are filed; court deliberates. Early 2025 U.S. Federal Court dismisses the class-action suit with prejudice. Implications for Crypto Influencers and Sports This dismissal sends a powerful message across the cryptocurrency and sports industries. For influencers and entities engaging in promotional deals, the ruling suggests a higher legal bar for plaintiffs linking general endorsement to specific investment losses. Nevertheless, legal analysts caution that this is not a blanket immunity. The decision hinged on the specific facts of this case, particularly the nature of the claims under state law. Other cases involving direct token promotion or more explicit investment advice may face different outcomes. Regulatory Clarity: The case underscores the ongoing struggle to apply traditional securities frameworks to novel crypto marketing. Risk for Promoters: While dismissed, the suit highlights the persistent legal and reputational risks for high-profile promoters. Investor Expectations: The ruling emphasizes the principle of caveat emptor (buyer beware) in a largely unregulated advertising space. Expert Analysis on Liability and Endorsement Professor Eleanor Vance, a securities law scholar, provided context: ‘This dismissal reflects a judicial reluctance to expansively interpret state consumer fraud statutes in the context of celebrity endorsements. The court is essentially saying that promoting a company’s services is not equivalent to selling its stock, absent a very specific set of misrepresentations. However, the SEC’s separate, ongoing enforcement actions against other crypto entities show federal regulators are taking a much more aggressive stance.’ This juxtaposition between state court rulings and federal regulatory action defines the current legal landscape. Conclusion The dismissal of the class-action lawsuit against Mark Cuban and the Dallas Mavericks marks a pivotal moment. It provides a temporary shield for similar promotional activities while clarifying the legal burdens for investors seeking restitution. The Mark Cuban lawsuit dismissed outcome reinforces that not all promotional speech translates to securities fraud, setting a precedent that will influence future litigation in the complex intersection of cryptocurrency, sports, and investment law. The decision ultimately highlights the evolving and often ambiguous legal standards governing digital asset promotion. FAQs Q1: What was the class-action lawsuit against Mark Cuban about? The lawsuit alleged that Mark Cuban and the Dallas Mavericks caused investor losses by promoting the Voyager Digital crypto lending platform, which later collapsed into bankruptcy. Q2: Why did the court dismiss the Mark Cuban lawsuit? The U.S. federal court dismissed the case after finding the plaintiffs’ claims under state securities and consumer fraud laws were insufficient to establish legal liability for the promotional activities. Q3: Does this mean crypto promotions are risk-free for celebrities? No. This ruling is specific to the facts of this case. Promoters can still face legal action, especially if they make specific false claims or are involved in promoting an unregistered security. Q4: What is the Howey Test mentioned in the article? The Howey Test is a legal standard from a 1946 Supreme Court case used to determine if a transaction qualifies as an ‘investment contract’ and is therefore subject to U.S. securities laws. Q5: Can the plaintiffs appeal this dismissal? Since the dismissal was ‘with prejudice,’ the plaintiffs cannot refile the same claims in that court. However, they may potentially appeal the decision to a higher circuit court.

Why Buying Mutuum Finance (MUTM) at $0.04 Feels Similar,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/remember-ethereum-eth-at-30-why-buying-mutuum-finance-mutm-at-0-04-feels-similar/,"At the time Ethereum (ETH) was at $30, few could have predicted that one day it could be pegged at $3,000, which amounts to a 100x increase. Yet, with the same logic of that particular historical example, some investors are of the idea that Mutuum Finance (MUTM) could be another investment with asymmetric potential and the best crypto to invest in at this point and time, with its current price of $0.04. When we calculate a 100x increase, MUTM could reach $4, which may seem ambitious; however, within the same parameters of early adoption and usage, and with the advancement of DeFi that led to the success of Ethereum, the reality may not be that impossible and far-fetched. Mutuum Finance is building a decentralized, non-custodial lending and borrowing platform, which targets one of DeFi’s most capital-intensive verticals, and with its tiered structure in presale, rising demand, and growing investor base, MUTM has made a great start to ensure they leverage this early push and maximize their early adoption advantage. For those searching for their next big crypto investment, Mutuum Finance’s entry price and scalable usage, is exactly what has brought about market FOMO. Ethereum (ETH) Price Ethereum is at a very critical level with $2,890 as a crucial support zone. According to analysts, this token must be able to overcome this support zone so as to ensure optimism persists. Based on this support zone, this token has all the chances of passing $3,650 and even $4,250, which speaks of renewed optimism inside the crypto market. For people tracking developments with regard to growth, this case of the Ethereum token draws attention to another crypto called Mutuum Finance (MUTM). Mutuum Finance Presale Phase 7 Mutuum Finance has entered Phase 7 in its presale process, and it is selling fast. This is one of the last opportunities for buyers to purchase MUTM for $0.04, as the price will hit $0.045 with the start of Phase 8, with a significant increase of almost 20%. Considering its growth potential and current price, many investors are treating it as a top crypto to buy before the wider market catches on. Mutuum Finance has raised a total of $19.5 million since the presale began. The overall number of MUTM token holders has risen to 18,620. Currently, at Phase 7 with a price of $0.04, it has seen a spectacular increase of 300% from Phase 1 at $0.01, reinforcing its reputation as the next big crypto for early-stage investors. Reinventing the Financing Space Mutuum Finance operates using a dual lending model that combines the Peer-to-Contract (P2C) model and the Peer-to-Peer (P2P) model. The P2C model provides passive income for users who lock away stablecoins like USDT into liquidity pools. This model also helps borrowers obtain money in a cost-effective way. The P2P model on the other hand facilitates peer-to-peer transactions without the involvement of a third party. Through the combination of P2C and P2P models in Mutuum Finance, a lending community that ensures a balance between safety, speed, and decentralization is created. All investors are able to completely control their lending activities in a way that suits either risk-averse or high return investors, making MUTM not just a promising DeFi token but the top crypto to buy for those focused on growth. Secure and Stable Ecosystem Mutuum Finance further facilitates the use of an Ethereum-based stablecoin that is completely collateralized and pegged to the value of the USD at par. The over-collateralization feature ensures that more value is locked in comparison to the stablecoin being created. This further stabilizes the future of the platform. Transparency and safety are further ensured by complete smart contract audits and transparent financial systems, giving confidence to investors and avoiding problems faced by other lending platforms on DeFi. The pillars of strong value on which Mutuum Finance is established guarantee a trustworthy and robust environment for all users to show why some see it as the next big crypto for long-term gains. Who can forget the price of ETH at $30? MUTM is currently $0.04, an early stage of double-lending DeFi platforms, $19.5 million raised, with 18,620 holders. Phase 8 increases to $0.045. When it hits 100x, it will go to $4, cementing its place as the top crypto to buy and a next big crypto for forward-thinking investors.

Despite the fluctuating price actions in the past few weeks, certain structures and narratives that bolster the leading altcoin’s value are still holding strong, raising the potential for a major upswing. Rising TVL Reinforces ETH’s Price Foundation In the dynamic cryptocurrency landscape, Ethereum’s Total Value Locked (TVL) is still emerging as a subtle but powerful anchor for the altcoin’s long-term price stability and the growth of its evolving ecosystem. Over the past few years, this narrative has held strong, bolstering ETH’s price. While short-term price action still varies with overall market sentiment, ETH’s core value is being reinforced by the consistent concentration of capital throughout the network. Milk Road, a crypto and macro researcher, stated that the price of the altcoin has increasingly tracked the amount of capital that is present on the network. The development suggests that ETH’s valuation is becoming more structurally supported and less speculative. As a result, the network is maturing to a phase where price floors are primarily determined by utilization rather than hype. According to the expert, if the TVL expands meaningfully, the network’s economy simultaneously sees noticeable growth. This implies deeper liquidity, stronger collateral base, and more durable demand for block space and the network’s security. Milk Road highlighted that non-speculative capital, such as stablecoins , treasuries, Real-World Assets (RWAs), and on-chain asset management, are likely the major drivers of the rising TVL. Meanwhile, as the capital flowing from these areas continues to scale, ETH’s floor also rises outside of bull markets. However, it appears to be more difficult to break into bear markets. It is worth noting that the broader ecosystem’s resilience is strengthened when this occurs, and also improves the long-term valuation anchor. Why You Shouldn’t Be An ETH Bear After examining the value of ETH vs. the size of the Ethereum ecosystem chart, Emperor Osmo, a data analyst and researcher, declares that being an ETH bear now is not an ideal choice despite the current bearish state of the market. Osmo’s bold statement hinges on the major shift in Ethereum network fees. As blockspace becomes commoditized, the expert highlighted that ETH has moved from generating 90% of fees generated by Layer 1s to 2%. Despite this massive shift, the network continues to dominate in TVL and ecosystem growth. The chart shows that ETH trades are at $353.2 billion while the ecosystem built on top of the network trades at $330 billion, representing a 1.1x premium. According to Osmo, this trend makes the assumption that there is no growth, no value capture, and no liquidity inflows.

Promotional campaigns, public optimism, and constant market commentary often shape perceptions of progress. A recent explanation shared by community analyst Arthur offers a different interpretation of XRP’s trajectory, one that rejects the assumption that price action should be an immediate priority. Instead, the focus is placed on how XRP is positioned within payment and liquidity systems, where function takes precedence over valuation. Arthur’s position rests on the idea that Ripple’s work is not centered on influencing market sentiment. Rather than attempting to elevate price through messaging or hype, Ripple is presented as concentrating on making XRP useful within real financial processes. This distinction is critical to understanding why XRP does not behave like many speculative assets that rely on attention to sustain momentum. NO BULLSHIT ! A lot of people ask why Ripple never tries to “pump” XRP. Honest answer: Ripple is not working for the price. Ripple is working for usage. XRP is not treated as a marketing product, but as liquidity infrastructure. Infrastructure doesn’t pump. It gets… — Arthur (@XrpArthur) December 28, 2025 Ripple’s Focus on Usage and Liquidity According to the analysis, Ripple treats XRP as a tool designed to facilitate liquidity rather than as a product to be marketed for price appreciation. Liquidity infrastructure, by its nature, tends to operate quietly in the background. Its relevance becomes apparent only when it is required to solve concrete problems, such as reducing friction in cross-border transactions or enabling efficient value transfer between systems. Arthur explains that infrastructure does not experience gradual promotional-driven appreciation. Instead, it is often overlooked until adoption reaches a point where usage is no longer optional. At that stage, demand emerges from necessity, not expectation. In this context, XRP’s valuation would adjust because certain participants must acquire and use it, not because they anticipate gains. Why This Is Difficult for Retail Holders This approach can be difficult for retail participants to accept. Many investors are accustomed to assets that respond quickly to narratives, announcements, or social media activity. XRP’s slower, utility-focused path can appear unrewarding during extended periods of muted price movement. Arthur acknowledges this frustration but argues that it is consistent with how infrastructure assets historically behave.

The lack of constant excitement may obscure progress, but it also sets the conditions for sharp valuation shifts once XRP becomes rooted in operational workflows. Utility as the Driver of Repricing Echoing this view, another market participant, LadyP, emphasized that XRP’s distinguishing feature lies in its capacity to support efficient value transfer. She described XRP as playing a role in enabling a connected financial environment where value moves with speed and reliability. In her assessment, meaningful repricing would follow demonstrated utility, not precede it. Taken together, these perspectives frame XRP as a long-term infrastructure-oriented asset.

Bitcoin has stabilized around $88,621, while the altcoin sector is showing encouraging signs of recovery as the altcoin market cap maintains levels above $1.2 trillion. Standout performers, including Zcash (ZEC), Humanity Protocol (H), Monero (XMR), and PIPPIN, have collectively posted a combined 2,200% gain over recent months. As the overall sentiment turns more positive, we’ve identified a new Layer-2 Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) token as the best altcoin to buy today, with potential to rally 100X when it lists in early 2026. Bitcoin Hyper Approaches $30M Milestone to Become the Best Altcoin to Buy Today That Could 100x in 2026 Bitcoin Hyper(HYPER) is currently conducting the presale for its native HYPER token in what has emerged as one of the year’s most notable token sales. The presale launched in mid-May 2025 and has grown into one of the largest token offerings of the year by funds raised, now approaching the $30 million threshold with no prior private or venture rounds. https://twitter.com/BTC_Hyper2/status/1945120283053940738?s=20 This structure indicates that demand has originated predominantly from public investors rather than closed-door seed allocations. Unlike speculative altcoins that experienced severe losses during the recent downturn, Bitcoin Hyper offers a more infrastructure-focused proposition. From an investor’s perspective, the primary value proposition of Bitcoin Hyper centers on its Layer-2 architecture , yield opportunities, and accessibility features. The Layer-2 design enables BTC holders to lock Bitcoin on Layer-1 and receive a corresponding representation of that BTC on the Hyper network, where transactions are faster, cheaper, and can interact with smart contracts. This infrastructure allows users to bridge BTC onto the Hyper network, wrap it into a tokenized version, and access decentralized applications, staking, and DeFi trading, all while keeping assets secured by Bitcoin’s base layer. Smart contracts using the Solana Virtual Machine (SVM) architecture , as the Bitcoin Hyper execute almost instantaneously at near-zero fees, providing developers with resources to build scalable applications while maintaining trust in Bitcoin’s underlying infrastructure. For these reasons, Bitcoin Hyper appears positioned as one of the New Year’s Eve altcoins capable of delivering outsized returns in 2026, meaning investors have limited time to act as the listing date approaches. How to Buy HYPER Before Price Increases HYPER is currently priced at $0.013505, though this rate will increase and continue rising until the sale concludes. To participate in the presale on today’s New Year’s Eve, investors can access HYPER through the official Bitcoin Hyper website by connecting a compatible wallet like Best Wallet. Participants can purchase using ETH, USDT, BNB, SOL, or even debit and credit cards, with all transactions processed through a fully transparent smart-contract mechanism. Buyers can also optionally activate staking and then return after the Token Generation Event (TGE) scheduled for early next year to claim the purchased tokens into the same wallet. Over 1.35 billion tokens are already locked in staking, offering rewards as high as 39% APY , a figure that continues to draw attention as traditional yields remain compressed below 4% APY. Critically, no HYPER token is designed to circulate until the Token Generation Event (TGE) , reducing the risk of pre-launch dumping that often damages early-stage projects. Due to this and all other solid fundamentals, Bitcoin Hyper is a stronger prospect than most new tokens, which is why it stands out as the best altcoin to buy on New Year’s Eve. If the broader market experiences a bullish rally in 2026, HYPER could launch at precisely the optimal moment, potentially delivering 100X returns for investors who capitalize on the current opportunity before the presale concludes and the token lists on exchanges.
