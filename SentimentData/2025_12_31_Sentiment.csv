The DEX officials have not yet issued a formal announcement to explain the origin of the delay and when they intend to fix the outage. Growing concerns among traders reveal that withdrawals on the Lighter exchange are failing. According to reports from the exchange’s users, withdrawal requests are prompting an error message stating “Too many L2 Withdrawals.” The error message hints that the Layer-2 withdrawal queue may be overcrowded or unable to keep up with user requests due to the Prover’s lag. A lag between Lighter’s Prover and its Sequencer is credited for the withdrawal delays Expect Panic at the Disco until Lighter actually communicates in Discord — zk baby. Withdrawals will pile up, transaction fails common, reversions and not a single post from team, just the Lighter candle holders. Can we get a Gauntlet thinkpiece on withdrawal ADLs? pic.twitter.com/0zK9strL4j — Mister Todd (@pondermint) December 30, 2025 The disruption is allegedly caused by a processing lag between the exchange’s Prover and its Sequencer, causing significant delays when finalizing withdrawals. On-chain data from Lighter’s explorer shows that the last committed block (Block #137759880) was finalized approximately 9 hours prior to the time of this publication. One of the most recent visible blocks recorded only one transaction and a single withdrawal log, showcasing a significant slowdown in withdrawal processing on the trading platform. Lighter has not issued a formal statement to address the cause of the withdrawal disruptions or when the issue will be sorted. The lack of communication has left users wondering whether the protocol is queuing withdrawals or temporarily restricting orders at the protocol level. Disruptions facing withdrawal transactions on Layer 2 platforms often spark a wave of concern among users due to their reliance on sequencers and provers when transferring funds back to Layer 1. Lighter users now depend on error messages and on-chain data to monitor the status of their funds. The disruptions emerged as Lighter rolled out its native Lighter Infrastructure Token (LIT) on Tuesday. A previous report by Cryptopolitan detailed that the token would start trading on Lighter’s platforms before spreading to other exchanges. The Lighter team announced the structure of the token, highlighting its key use cases as part of a growing ecosystem. The token launch included an airdrop campaign to early adopters worth 25% of the token’s fully diluted value. Lighter stated that a portion of the revenue generated from the project’s decentralized exchange will be allocated for token buybacks and growth-oriented use cases, contingent upon prevailing market conditions. The token buyback program is part of the developers’ strategy to create long-term value for the protocol’s community members. According to data from CoinMarketCap, a cryptocurrency data aggregator, Lighter’s LIT is currently trading at $2.84, with a market capitalization of $710 million and a 24-hour trading volume of $8.3 million. The crypto asset is up 5.72% and has hit a high of $4.04 since its launch. Data from Coingecko shows that Lighter has registered open interests worth $1.4 billion in the last 24 hours and reached a trading volume of $3.6 billion in the last day. DEX perpetual futures trading is gaining popularity among traders Perpetual futures trading on decentralized exchanges has experienced explosive growth in 2025 on platforms such as Hyperliquid, Lighter, and Aster. Cryptopolitan previously reported that derivatives trading on DEXs surged in 2025 as traders sought ways to amplify their exposure with limited capital. The report highlighted that perpetual futures monthly trades have exceeded $1 trillion, with Hyperliquid leading the pack. Hyperliquid recently announced it had onboarded more than 600,000 new users in 2025 and achieved $844 million in revenue. Cryptopolitan reported that the DEX drew a total of $3.87 billion in inflows and a total trading volume of $2.95 trillion, spanning 198.9 billion transactions since January this year. During the year, the decentralized exchange averaged about $8.34 billion per day, with spot trading volume on the exchange exceeding $116 billion. HIP-3 trading activities also surged, reaching $11 billion. Bitcoin was the most actively traded cryptocurrency on the platform, achieving a trading volume of $1.16 trillion.

On-chain data shows that validator deposits have once again outpaced exits, even after months of higher withdrawal activity, reflecting improved sentiment among holders. Notably, the change is being closely watched as a potential catalyst that could tighten supply and support a move towards or above the $4,000 level. Ethereum Staking Deposits Overtake Withdrawals Ethereum is seeing a notable shift in staking activity as validator deposits have surpassed withdrawals for the first time in six months. Validator entry queues have surged to more than twice the size of exit queues, pointing to renewed demand for staking and growing confidence among institutional partners and ETH long-term holders . Data from ValidatorQueue shows that Ethereum’s validator entry queue has climbed to roughly 788,310 ETH, at the time of writing. At current prices, this represents about $2.3 billion in value and comes with an estimated wait time of 13 days and 16 hours to activate new validators. By contrast, ETH’s validator exit queue remains significantly smaller, standing at around 312,091, valued at approximately $916,923, as of writing. Notably, the current level represents the highest ETH volume queued for staking since late November. A surge in staking inflows above withdrawals has also been frequently associated with bullish price action for Ethereum. Meanwhile, treasury buyers have played a significant role in this increase in validator entry queues, with Ethereum-focused firm Bitmine leading the way. Data from LookOnChain reveals that the crypto company staked 342,560 ETH on December 28, valued at roughly $1 billion. Bitmine’s staking activity comes as it prepares to launch its Made in America Validator Network (MAVAN) in 2026. Such large-scale staking by treasury firms typically reduces ETH’s liquid supply, which, in turn, can support higher prices. Beyond treasury companies, Ethereum’s broader network participation is also rising. ValidatorQueue reports that there are now more than 983,060 active validators on the blockchain, representing approximately 29.29% of the total supply, or around 35.5 million ETH, currently staked. Moreover, the Ethereum Pectra upgrade has improved users’ staking experience and raised maximum validator limits, making restating easier for large balances. How This Could Push ETH Price Past $4,000 Historically, periods when the Ethereum validator entry queue exceeds the exit queue have often preceded major ETH price rallies. Analysts note that the last time staking deposits surpassed withdrawals, in June 2025, Ethereum’s price had doubled over a short span. If history repeats itself, the cryptocurrency could experience another sharp rally in 2026 . From its current price of above $2,930, a continuation of trends could push it well above $4,000. Analysts also confirm that ETH is currently testing the $3,000 level, and a strong bounce from this zone could open the path toward $4,000.",Ethereum|ETH|ETH news|ETH Price|ethereum news|ethereum price|ethusd|ETHUSDT,EN,0,0,ETH|TRADING|DIGITAL ASSET TREASURY|MACROECONOMICS|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-12-30 22:00:50

Over the past year, the network generated more than $1.5 billion in revenue, exceeding Ethereum and Hyperliquid combined. This outcome reinforced Solana’s scale-driven economic model at a time when fee pressure challenged rival networks. Besides revenue growth, the performance strengthened confidence in Solana’s long-term throughput strategy and market positioning heading into 2026. Solana Revenue Surge Redefines Network Economics Data from Blockworks Research showed Solana leading all blockchains in annual revenue during 2025. Hyperliquid followed with $780 million, while Ethereum posted $690 million for the same period. Consequently, Solana outperformed both networks despite maintaining some of the lowest transaction fees in the market. ​​Solana co-founder Anatoly Yakovenko celebrated the results on X, citing capacity expansion and cost efficiency. He emphasized that scale, not high fees, drove sustainable revenue growth. Significantly, Solana achieved this outcome while keeping median transaction fees below one cent. This structure allowed massive volume growth, which translated into higher aggregate revenue. Additionally, other blockchains trailing Solana included Tron, BNB Chain, Bitcoin, Base, Arbitrum, Optimism, and Avalanche. Price Action and Market Position Entering 2026 Source: CoinCodex Solana’s market price reflected modest stability alongside its recent revenue milestone. SOL traded at $123.89, showing limited movement over the past week with a 0.30% decline. Despite muted price action, trading activity remained firm, with 24-hour volume at $6.46 billion, indicating sustained liquidity. With roughly 560 million SOL in circulation, Solana’s market capitalization stood near $69.74 billion. However, December delivered choppy price action, leaving sentiment mixed. According to Onur, Solana enters 2026 at a technical crossroads where direction remains uncertain. Hence, traders now balance strong fundamentals against cautious short-term signals. Technical Levels, ETFs, and Derivatives Signals Historical data showed Solana often rebounded in January after weak December closes. In 2023, the token surged 140% following year-end selling pressure. Even in 2025, SOL recovered with a 22% January gain after a red December. Additionally, ETF flows offered support, as Solana-linked products avoided weekly net outflows since launch. Total inflows recently exceeded $755 million, indicating selective institutional interest. However, derivatives markets sent mixed signals. Futures positioning remained net short across several venues, including Hyperliquid. Consequently, analysts watched open interest closely for signs of conviction. Onur highlighted $129 as a pivotal resistance level. A sustained close above could open a move toward the mid-$160 range. Conversely, a drop below $116 could confirm a bearish EMA crossover and deepen corrective pressure.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|ETH|SOL|TRADING|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-12-30 22:00:56

The proposals would amend the Criminal Code and the Criminal Procedure Code of the Russian Federation. The latest move aims to formalize liability for mining digital currency outside the legal framework introduced last year. Under the draft, illegal mining could be punishable by a fine of up to 1.5 million rubles or forced labor for up to two years. Offenses involving especially large income or committed by an organized group could carry prison terms of up to five years. Prison, Forced Labor, Heavy Fines As part of the initiative, the Criminal Code would be amended with a new Article 171.6, titled “Illegal mining of digital currency and activities of a mining infrastructure operator.” The article defines illegal mining as the extraction of digital currency by individuals or entities not included in the official state register of persons engaged in cryptocurrency mining. Liability would arise if such activity causes large-scale damage to citizens, organizations, or the state, or if it generates income of at least 3.5 million rubles. The proposed article provides for penalties, including compulsory labor for up to 480 hours or forced labor for up to two years in cases meeting these thresholds. Tougher sanctions would apply in aggravated circumstances. According to Part Two of the draft article, offenses committed by an organized group, those that result in especially large-scale damage, or those associated with especially large income of more than 13.5 million rubles, could be punishable by fines ranging from 500,000 to 2.5 million rubles or by fines equivalent to one to three years of the offender’s income. Courts could also impose up to five years of forced labor or up to five years in prison, with or without an additional fine of up to 400,000 rubles or six months’ income. The proposal comes after the legalization of cryptocurrency mining in Russia, which came into force in November 2024. On the same day, the Federal Tax Service launched special registries that required all legal entities, individual entrepreneurs, and operators of mining infrastructure involved in the mining sector to register with the authorities. According to the Federal Tax Service, more than 1,000 participants were listed in the registries as of the end of May 2025. Current rules also require all miners, including individuals, to report their mined digital currency on a monthly basis through a dedicated section of the Federal Tax Service’s website. In early December, Deputy Prime Minister Alexander Novak said the Russian government plans to introduce criminal liability in 2026 for illegal cryptocurrency mining as well as for illegal lending. Power Theft by Crypto Miners The crackdown comes amid growing concerns over the strain illegal mining places on Russia’s power infrastructure. Earlier this year, Rosseti Group, the country’s state-owned power grid operator, reported losses of more than 1.3 billion rubles in 2024 due to unauthorized “black” mining operations, particularly in the North Caucasus, Novosibirsk, and Volga regions. Some operators ran thousands of devices and illegally drew electricity on an industrial scale, which prompted over 40 criminal investigations.

Three people familiar with the process said authorities have allegedly delivered this message directly to companies seeking clearance. The rule is not written into public policy, but it is being enforced through procurement reviews tied to plant construction and expansion. China is using this gatekeeping method to force local sourcing at scale. Companies are required to submit tenders that clearly list equipment origins. If the domestic share falls below the threshold, approvals usually stop there. Officials may allow limited flexibility when supply gaps exist, especially for advanced production lines where local tools are still incomplete. One person said regulators actually want the ratio higher. “Authorities prefer if it is much higher than 50%,” the source reportedly said. “Eventually, they are aiming for the plants to use 100% domestic equipment.” Chinese authorities tighten chipmaker approvals in efforts to change supply chains inward The requirement gained speed after the United States tightened export rules in 2023. Those measures blocked sales of advanced AI chips and key semiconductor tools to China. While some foreign equipment from the U.S., Japan, South Korea, and Europe remains available, manufacturers are now choosing local suppliers even when alternatives exist. This is no longer about access. It is about compliance. Applications that fail the sourcing test are often rejected. For advanced lines, the rules ease slightly because domestic gear does not fully cover every step. Even then, firms must show clear intent to localize over time. The policy stands as one of the strongest moves yet to cut reliance on foreign technology. It also reshapes purchasing decisions across the entire chip sector. State-linked buyers are already responding. Public procurement data shows 421 orders for domestic lithography tools and components this year, valued at about 850 million yuan. That marks a sharp rise in demand for locally developed machines. To support this shift, Beijing continues to fund the sector through the Big Fund, which launched a third phase in 2024 with 344 billion yuan, equal to about $49 billion. Domestic equipment makers gain ground under pressure President Xi Jinping has framed chip independence as a “whole nation” effort. Thousands of engineers and researchers across companies and labs are involved. Earlier this month, scientists reported work on a prototype machine capable of producing cutting-edge chips, an outcome Washington has tried to block for years. A former employee at Naura Technology allegedly said that fabs once favored U.S. tools. “Before, domestic fabs like SMIC would prefer U.S. equipment and would not really give Chinese firms a chance,” the person said. “But that changed starting with the 2023 U.S export restrictions, when Chinese fabs had no choice but to work with domestic suppliers.” The policy is already reshaping results. In etching, a key step that removes material from silicon wafers, Naura is testing tools on a 7nm production line at SMIC, after earlier success at 14nm. One source said the mandate sped up progress. “Naura’s etching results have been accelerated by the government requiring fabs to use at least 50% domestic equipment,” the person allegedly said. Foreign suppliers like Lam Research and Tokyo Electron once dominated this segment. Now they are being partially replaced by Naura and Advanced Micro-Fabrication Equipment. Naura also supplies memory chipmakers with etching tools for chips exceeding 300 layers and developed electrostatic chucks to replace parts that Lam could no longer service after 2023. Naura filed 779 patents in 2025, more than double its filings in 2020 and 2021, while AMEC filed 259. And Naura’s first-half 2025 sales rose 30% to 16 billion yuan, while AMEC reported a 44% jump to 5 billion yuan, according to Reuters.

Allegedly, the last tranche may have even been closer to $22.5 billion, but either way, it’s done. The Japanese conglomerate now holds over 10% ownership in the Sam Altman-led AI powerhouse because apparently, a few billion here and there just wasn’t enough, and the final payment was transferred last week, with a deal that’s been in the works since early 2024. SoftBank had initially invested $8 billion directly into the ChatGPT creator, then brought in a crew of co-investors to syndicate another $10 billion. OpenAI is preparing for IPO and massive infrastructure plans The SoftBank-OpenAI deal was originally priced at a $260 billion pre-money valuation, and SoftBank was expected to drip out the funds across 12 to 24 months, with some of the capital earmarked for OpenAI’s wild Stargate venture with Oracle and the White House, among others. Just a few weeks ago, SoftBank dumped its entire $5.8 billion stake in Nvidia . People close to the matter have allegedly said the Nvidia sale, plus other liquidity moves, were aimed at fueling the OpenAI mega-deal. And now that it’s finalized, there’s no ambiguity about where that money went. Over the next few years, OpenAI is planning to throw more than $1.4 trillion into infrastructure. That’s trillion with a T. The spending spree includes deep collaborations with Nvidia (again), AMD, and Broadcom. Everyone’s cashing in on the AI boom—and SoftBank wants a front-row seat. The startup isn’t just collecting checks from Tokyo, either. Microsoft has been backing it for years. Amazon is reportedly exploring a $10 billion investment, and even Disney slid in recently with a $1 billion deal, letting Sora, OpenAI’s video generator, use its roster of characters.

The move not only strengthens BitMine’s position as a major validator but also shows the company’s deep institutional commitment to Ethereum’s long-term value proposition, particularly as it continues to expand its total ETH holdings, which now reportedly exceed 4.1 million ETH. Additionally, BitMine is actively developing its “Made in America Validator Network (MAVAN),” slated for launch in the first quarter of 2026, indicating a major infrastructure play alongside its substantial asset accumulation. California’s Crypto Tax Quake: Unrealized Gains Proposal Sparks Exodus Fears The “ 2026 Billionaire Tax Act ” is also driving capital flight fears. The proposal seeks a 5% annual tax on net wealth above $1 billion, explicitly targeting unrealized gains in crypto assets. Critics like Kraken co-founder Jesse Powell argue that this forces founders to liquidate positions to pay taxes on paper profits, potentially triggering structural selling pressure if passed. The implications of such a tax extend beyond just billionaires, potentially setting a precedent that could ripple through the entire U.S. crypto industry. The difficulty in accurately valuing often volatile crypto assets for annual tax purposes, especially those with limited liquidity, presents a major practical and administrative challenge. Should this bill gain traction, the “pre-emptive exodus” of crypto-native capital from Silicon Valley to more tax-friendly jurisdictions like the UAE or Florida could rapidly accelerate before the 2026 tax year begins, potentially altering the development of the sector and investment within the state.

Key momentum indicators suggest selling pressure is fading, while long-term holders appear to be quietly absorbing supply. Although price action remains cautious for now, the setup is sparking discussions about whether XRP is positioning itself for another major move once market confidence returns. A Rare Momentum Reset On The Higher Timeframe In a significant technical development on XRP’s high-timeframe charts, Steph is Crypto has highlighted that the Stochastic RSI on the 3-week interval has plummeted to a value of 0.00. This level represents a state of total compression for the oscillator, signaling a momentum shift that is rare in the asset’s trading history. Related Reading: XRP Price Trims Upside, Slow Decline Signals Seller Dominance The rarity of this signal cannot be overstated, as it has occurred only once before at the absolute depths of the 2022 bear market. Historically, when the indicator reaches zero, it serves as a definitive marker that the prevailing selling pressure has reached a point of total exhaustion. From a structural perspective, it indicates that the energy behind the downward trend has completely dried up. It is important to note that this does not guarantee an immediate recovery. When this technical phenomenon surfaced in previous cycles, it preceded a prolonged accumulation phase. During that period, the price stabilized as smart money began to build positions, creating a foundation for the next major impulsive move toward the upside. Seeing this signal reappear now suggests that XRP’s downside risk is structurally limited at current valuations. It points to a market environment where long-term holders are actively absorbing the available supply, transitioning from a distribution phase to a period of strategic positioning. A Familiar Market Rhythm Is Emerging on XRP’s Long-Term Chart Altcoin Pioneers, in a recent update, highlighted a striking fractal pattern forming on XRP’s chart, suggesting that history may be repeating with remarkable accuracy. A 3-day chart comparison reveals strong similarities between the 2016–2017 market cycle and the current structure, both shaped by a prolonged ABC corrective phase before a major breakout. Related Reading: XRP Exchange Inflows Spike To End 2025: Will Price Decline Deepen? In the earlier cycle, XRP spent months completing its correction before launching into an explosive rally. The 2024 structure mirrors the past ABC pattern, while the ongoing 2025–2026 correction is aligning closely with the final C-wave down to the $1.87 region, though on a slightly shorter timeline. If this fractal continues to play out, Altcoin Pioneers believe XRP could be nearing the end of a painful shakeout phase, setting the stage for the next powerful upside leg. XRP has followed this script before, and those who held through the last cycle understand what’s coming next.

56617683,649540,1767135636,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/56617683.jpeg,Here’s The XRP Fractal That Says Price Is Headed To $27,https://bitcoinist.com/fractal-says-xrp-is-headed-to-27/,"A technical analysis shared by EGRAG CRYPTO outlines a specific fractal structure that he believes is still guiding XRP’s broader price behavior. The model does not frame the move as inevitable, and it leaves room for uncertainty . Instead, it outlines a conditional roadmap based on how XRP continues to move within a white fractal that the analyst says is tracking with roughly 82% accuracy and, if maintained, points to a possible advance to as high as $27. What The White Fractal Is Showing Right Now The focus of the analysis is what EGRAG refers to as the White Fractal, which is the most realistic version of the different fractals he is currently tracking. Unlike earlier fractal iterations, this one is treated as an evolving structure that must continue to align with price action to keep being valid. According to the analyst, the current setup is about 82% aligned with XRP’s price action this year, based on similarities in accumulation behavior, breakout formation, and interaction with exponential moving averages. EGRAG was careful to note that this version has not yet earned a full upgrade to his higher-confidence blue or green fractals, keeping expectations grounded in what the structure is actually delivering so far. How The Fractal Projects XRP Price Targets The prediction for XRP’s price outlook is a sequence of price zones, each tied to a declining probability as price action moves higher. According to the projection, the most statistically favored outcome is around the $3.20 level, which EGRAG assigns a 75% probability if the fractal structure continues to play out. From there, the roadmap allows for a continuation to $8, although the probability drops to about 65% due to the additional momentum and participation required for XRP to sustain that move. After $8, the fractal begins to enter more speculative price territories. The next price target zone is around $15 to $16, and EGRAG places the probability here at around 55%. The final and most ambitious zone sits between $20 and $27, which he assigns a 50% probability. This upper range represents the peak end of the fractal projection and corresponds with the final expansion phase shown in the chart above. EGRAG estimates that, if the structure is valid, the expansion phase would most likely unfold between June 2026 and October 2026. However, he was careful to note that these projections are not guarantees. A sustained break below $1.60 would reduce the probability of XRP’s price action following projections by the fractal. A deeper move below $1.30 would mean that XRP’s current cycle has diverged too far from the fractal being referenced, which invalidates the model entirely.",XRP|Egrag Crypto|ripple|White Fractal|XRP news|XRP price|XRPUSD|XRPUSDT,EN,0,0,MARKET|TRADING|XRP|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-12-30 23:00:36

That would make it the best performance in five years for the group, second only to tech. Companies from Nucor to Sherwin-Williams, and packaging giants like Smurfit WestRock and Ball Corp., are in the spotlight. The rise is tied directly to trade protections and a sharp shift in consumer goods demand. Metals and packaging stocks will lead the charge, both forecast to post over 30% profit growth. Steel prices are up, and companies selling boxes and cans are seeing more orders as food brands push volume using discounts. Steelmakers prepare for backlog boost as tariffs drive prices Richard Bourke from Bloomberg Intelligence said tariffs on imported steel are giving U.S. producers more control over pricing. “U.S. mills should continue to displace imports as long as 50% Section 232 tariffs remain in place,” he wrote. These are the same Trump-era levies still shaping trade today. Nucor, which Bourke called the U.S. mill with the widest product range and some extra capacity, reported a strong order book for 2026. It pointed to projects in energy, infrastructure, data centers, and manufacturing as key drivers. In a December update, the company said existing policy should lead to “continued gradual improvement in business conditions.” Steel Dynamics also flagged a larger backlog. The company expects lower interest rates to help push up infrastructure spending and bring more production back to the U.S. Bourke explained that many of the orders in play are lag contracts, meaning the money won’t show up until next year. The packaging sector isn’t having the same smooth ride. Tariffs here are more of a burden, but some companies are getting help from their clients. General Mills and PepsiCo have been promoting products more aggressively, which means higher volume. Truist’s Michael Roxland said this trend has boosted Amcor and similar suppliers. Jefferies analysts believe easier year-over-year comparisons and a slow return of consumer confidence could help the sector in the second half of the year. But right now, it’s tight. RBC’s Matthew McKellar said mills in North America are already near full capacity, which could support a price hike. Packaging, chemicals, and construction firms shift strategy for growth Packaging companies are reacting with internal changes. Amcor CEO Peter Konieczny said the company plans to meet its 2026 targets using synergies, not economic improvement. The company sees adjusted profit growth of 12% to 17%, its best in five years. Still, the overall picture in packaging is messy. Growth from food producers hasn’t extended to other customers, so firms are turning to cost cuts and plant closures to manage softer demand and economic drag. International Paper, which had four years of declining profits, now expects a turnaround. But the company isn’t upbeat. Executives told an industry event in December that demand is still weak. They blamed inflation, trade pressure, and the sluggish housing market. “In North America, we still feel very tight from a supply-demand perspective,” said CFO Lance Loeffler. “All we need is a little bit of spark on the demand side, and I think it would be really good for business.” Outside packaging and metals, the remaining materials sub-sectors are hoping for a rate-cut lifeline. Chemicals are forecast to finally grow after three rough years. The same goes for construction materials, which dropped in 2025 but are set to rebound. Sherwin-Williams is ready to benefit if home sales pick up, said Citigroup’s Patrick Cunningham. Albemarle is also expected to gain ground thanks to higher lithium prices from rising demand in energy storage. For construction stocks, like CRH, falling interest rates could lower borrowing costs and push more projects forward. BI analyst Sonia Baldeira said this could help unlock residential and commercial construction deals stuck in limbo. Every piece of this puzzle points to a rare winning streak for the materials sector, one fueled by tariffs, backlogs, tighter supply, and cost cuts.

Cypherpunk Now Holds Nearly 2%,https://cryptonews.com/news/zcash-cypherpunk-corporate-treasury-play-bitcoin/,"Cypherpunk Technologies has deepened its bet on Zcash, adding fuel to a growing debate over whether privacy-focused cryptocurrencies can play a role similar to Bitcoin in corporate treasuries. The Nasdaq-listed company said it purchased an additional 56,418.09 ZEC for about $29 million at an average price of $514.02 per token. With the latest transaction, Cypherpunk now holds 290,062.67 ZEC, equal to roughly 1.76% of Zcash’s circulating supply. The company said its total position was accumulated at a blended average price of $334.41 per ZEC. Cypherpunk Sets Its Sights on 5% of the Zcash Network Chief investment officer Will McEvoy said the company is working toward a long-term goal of holding 5% of the Zcash network. He framed the strategy around the growing relevance of financial privacy while also pointing to plans to expand into other privacy-focused technologies. The move comes after a sharp corporate pivot, as the firm was formerly known as Leap Therapeutics before rebranding in November as Cypherpunk Technologies and has now repositioned itself as a Zcash-focused digital asset company. Its stock has been increasing almost 170% since the rebrand, up to approximately $1.18 compared to approximately $0.44, as per Google Finance. Source: Google Finance Zcash, in its turn, has been registering among the most robust performances in the crypto market this year. The token has increased over 800% in the last 12 months and currently trades at roughly $530, based on CoinGecko. Source: CoinGecko Bitcoin, by comparison, is down by approximately 5% over the same period, though ZEC was up almost 27% in the past 7 days alone. Notably, Zcash daily trade volume dropped by approximately half to approximately 499 million dollars in the last 24 hours, showing that activity slowed following the recent explosion. As Bitcoin Dominates Treasuries, Zcash Offers a Privacy Alternative Zcash is a fork of Bitcoin, which was released in 2016 and has many structural features in common with BTC, such as a limit of 21 million coins and a proof-of-work blockchain. The difference lies in the privacy, in which Zcash employs zero-knowledge, known as zk-SNARKs , proofs that users can use to conceal the transaction information like sender, recipient, and value, yet still provide optional transparency and auditability by using viewing keys. Those features have shaped how ZEC is being discussed as a treasury asset. Bitcoin’s appeal to corporations has rested on verifiable scarcity, deep liquidity, and growing regulatory clarity, reinforced by the approval of U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs earlier this year. Companies holding BTC typically treat it as a long-term store of value or macro hedge, with potential returns tied to price appreciation rather than operating income. Zcash, by comparison, is often described by companies adopting it as a hedge centered on privacy. Cypherpunk and a small number of other firms, including Reliance Global Group, have cited the need to protect sensitive financial activity as a reason to hold ZEC. Like Bitcoin, Zcash does not generate cash flow, and any treasury “revenue” would come from unrealized or realized gains if prices rise. Market participants are divided on near-term price direction, with Former BitMEX CEO Arthur Hayes saying ZEC could be setting up for a move toward $1,000, pointing to potential liquidity shifts that may favor privacy-focused assets.

Even after its recent surge, Zcash remains more than 80% below its all-time high of $3,191.93. The post Is Zcash the Next Corporate Treasury Play?

Monero is an attractive investment because it emphasizes privacy and security, utilizing advanced cryptographic techniques to ensure transaction confidentiality, which has created a strong demand in the market . Its growing adoption across various use cases and a decentralized development model enhance its long-term potential. With a limited supply and increasing investor interest, Monero offers a unique opportunity for those seeking financial autonomy and privacy to invest in cryptocurrency. However, investors should remain cautious of regulatory risks and market volatility when considering Monero as part of their portfolio, making it essential to seek investment advice. Why is XMR down?

Monero is expected to recover toward its all-time high of $518 by mid-2026 as the privacy chain continues to reduce its tech debt and progresses toward greater utility and privacy. However, the platform might have to overcome regulatory scrutiny and challenges before it can see mass adoption, as it remains highly speculative . How much will Monero be worth in 5 years? The Monero price prediction for 2030 suggests a minimum price of $1,048.76 and an average trading price of $1,142.11 . The maximum forecasted price is set at $1,208.35. Will XMR reach $1000? The chances of Monero (XMR) hitting $1,000 hinge on various factors, which will influence its future price movements. The adoption of privacy transactions and technological advances could increase demand. Favorable regulations and market sentiment toward privacy coins would also help. Yet, regulatory risks, competition, and market volatility creating an atmosphere of extreme fear are challenges that Monero traders could face that could hinder significant growth. $1,000 is possible with favorable conditions, especially considering the current price but market dynamics and regulations will shape its path. Does XMR have a good long-term future? Monero (XMR) has the potential for a strong long-term future due to its focus on privacy and security, which makes it attractive to users seeking anonymity. However, many investors have concerns regarding privacy, regulatory scrutiny, and notoriety from being the favored medium for some past criminals, which impact the current Monero sentiment. Monero’s commitment to ring confidential transactions and the broader monero project gives it a solid foundation for long-term growth, but it must carefully navigate market and regulatory landscapes.

May 2021 marked the highest point in Monero’s history. Monero’s price projections revealed the coin’s security. They provide investors with optimism that they will be freed from the persecution of some authorities simply by buying or selling Monero Across 2023, Monero’s price rose by 11.49%. The highest price was $278.56, and the lowest was $114.16. In January 2024, Monero stayed stable around the $150.00 mark as market momentum remained low. However, the stability was short-lived as February crashed to $101.95. However, XMR showed swift recovery as it closed the month near the $150.00 level again. In March and April 2024, XMR saw a steady decline from $150.00 to $120.00, where it found key support. In May 2024, XMR observed steady bullish pressure as the price rose from $120.00, approaching resistance at $150. In June 2024, Monero (XMR) traded within the $150 – $175 price range as either side struggled to make a clear breakthrough. In July, the crypto traded around the $155 mark as the price volatility remained relatively low. XMR opened trading at $156.05 in August and ended the month at $176.00, making remarkable gains. September was bearish for the asset, as the price declined below the $160 mark by the end of the month. In October, Monero observed a steep crash and has been making a swift recovery since then. In December, Monero made remarkable strides as the asset’s price broke past the $220 mark, albeit briefly as it closed the month below $200. In January, Monero saw a bullish January as the price rose from below the $200 mark to $238 by the end of the month. In February, the price fell towards the $215 mark as bears dominate the markets. In March, the price observes mixed momentum and closed the month slightly below $215. In April the consolidation continued until late into the month when it spiked past the $325 mark before ending the month around $275. In May the price continued rising rapidly as the bulls cruised past $300 ending the month around $320. During June the price continued to observe high volatility but observed low net change as the asset closed the month around $313. In July the price saw a huge spike in volatility as the price rose past $340 but the asset closed the month below the $310 mark. In August the price declined rapidly falling to the $260 mark by the month’s end. In September, the price rose to the $340 and while it did not maintain the level but managed to close the month above the $320 mark. In October the price continued to rise ending the month above the $340 mark, a trend separating it from most other cryptocurrencies that saw a decline during the period. In November, the bullish rally continued with XMR crossing the $400 mark by the end of the month.",Crypto Price Predictions,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|BUSINESS|MARKET|TRADING|XMR|FORKS|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-12-30 23:30:00

Top altcoins like Ethereum (ETH) and XRP (XRP) have swung to negative territory on a year-to-date (YTD) basis, while BNB (BNB) has managed to deliver 21% during this period. Where could these three coins be heading at the beginning of 2026? Gemini, Google’s powerful AI model, shared with us its predictions for these altcoins. #1 – Gemini Prediction for XRP (XRP) XRP (XRP) consolidated this year following a strong spike in late 2024. Its legal victory in a long-standing case against the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), along with robust ecosystem growth initiatives, has influenced its price action in 2025. According to Gemini, the key support to watch to prevent a big decline to $1.20 would be the $1.75 area. Meanwhile, its most relevant resistance sits at $2.36. This is where the 200-day exponential moving average (EMA) sits for the token. A move above this mark would confirm a bullish outlook for XRP. Gemini predicts the following for the first quarter of 2026: “ The sharp drops seem to have halted, suggesting a potential bottoming process in early 2026. ” #2 – Gemini Prediction for Ethereum (ETH) Ethereum’s performance this year was mostly influenced by the successful implementation of the Pectra upgrade back in April. This technical overhaul propelled the price to a new all-time high just a few months later. Gemini indicates that the key support to watch at the time is the $2,800 area. A break below this mark could result in a drop to $2,400 in the near term. Meanwhile, the $3,370 area seems to be the key resistance that the price must overcome to rally back to the $4,000 zone. Its baseline prediction for Ethereum for the beginning of 2026 is consolidation. Gemini concluded the following based on its analysis of the latest price action: “ETH is likely to trade sideways in early 2026 as it builds a base. ” #3 – Gemini Prediction for BNB Coin (BNB) BNB Coin (BNB) has been this year’s top-performing token in the top 5. The growing popularity of decentralized protocols like Aster and Pancake Swap has contributed to increasing the network’s transaction volumes. The token reached a new all-time high recently at $1,360. Gemini sees the $800 level as the key support to watch if the price pulls back in the first few weeks of 2026. Meanwhile, BNB needs to rise past the $1,000 psychological barrier to rally back to the highs seen in October. Gemini sees this upcoming first quarter of 2026 as a “decision point” for the market. The AI model concluded the following regarding BNB’s outlook: “ Early 2026 will likely see a decisive move away from the $850 pivot. Given the flat RSI (47), a bounce is slightly more probable than a crash if the general crypto market stabilizes. ” Gemini Thinks The Market Has Bottomed Already After an assessment of the price action of these top three altcoins, Gemini shared this interesting take about the state of the crypto market: “The charts suggest that the crypto market is in a late-stage correction or early accumulation phase . The explosive growth of mid-2025 has faded, and early 2026 will likely be defined by capital preservation and range-bound trading.” As the market as a whole consolidates, seizing the most attractive opportunities in certain categories like meme coins could make a big difference. Top crypto presales like Maxi Doge ($MAXI) are potential hidden gems that could deliver interesting gains as a new year begins. Maxi Doge ($MAXI) Raises Over $4M to Bring Meme’s Hype to the Trading Space Maxi Doge ($MAXI) is an Ethereum meme coin inspired by the popular Doge meme.

Hur Jae-hong, chairman and CEO of L&F, watched his listed holdings fall from $800 million to $134 million, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index. The contract, once hailed as game-changing, has officially been downgraded to almost nothing. Tesla’s Cybertruck delays and weak customer demand choked the order before it could deliver. Tesla’s Cybertruck delay kills a key EV battery deal L&F builds high-nickel cathodes for electric vehicle batteries. These were supposed to go straight to Tesla for the Cybertruck. But that model ran into constant delays, and buyers just didn’t bite. No one’s seen much of the angular truck, and L&F’s order quietly died behind the scenes. The company confirmed this week that the massive order is now worth less than $10,000. The stock market didn’t wait for the news. L&F shares have been dropping since their 2023 peak, when the Tesla contract was first announced. They’ve now plunged more than 70%, dragged down by the collapse of the order and a general slump in EV demand worldwide. It didn’t help that L&F was leaning heavily on LG Energy Solution Ltd., its top customer, and investor confidence began to crack long before Monday’s shock filing. Still, analysts say this isn’t a full break-up between L&F and Elon Musk’s company. “L&F had probably already stopped supplying cathodes to Tesla since last year,” said Changmin Lee, an analyst at KB Securities. The materials were only meant for some Cybertruck models, and with that project stalling, the deliveries never picked up. Lee added that the recent filing “will likely be extremely limited” in terms of market impact, since the contract had already been factored out of forecasts. L&F’s long-term partnerships now under pressure Even though the Cybertruck plan crashed, L&F’s business with Tesla still supplies Model Y components indirectly through LG Energy Solution, which accounts for around 80% of its total sales. That pipeline is running without disruption for now. But the loss of the direct Tesla order smashed L&F’s diversification strategy.In 2021, the company inked a deal with Redwood Materials, the US battery recycler run by Tesla’s ex-CTO, JB Straubel. That partnership was supposed to help L&F lower its dependence on LG Energy Solution to 50% by 2025. That goal now looks shaky. There might still be a way out. Anna Lee, an analyst at Yuanta Securities Korea, said L&F is expected to begin production for Rivian in 2026, after securing a deal back in March. They’re also sending mid-nickel cathodes to SK On Co., used in Hyundai Motor’s EV batteries. That means they’ve still got irons in the fire. “A short-term damper in investor sentiment is inevitable,” said Anna. “But there is an increasing possibility that the sector will regain attention in 2026, specifically centering on energy storage systems for AI data centers.” Still, none of that changes the fact that a $2.9 billion Tesla contract just evaporated into dust, and L&F’s billionaire dreams were smashed into seven thousand bucks.

Here’s what history suggests could happen next. Bitcoin Social Volume Suggests Rise Of Greed In a new post on X, analytics firm Santiment has talked about how social media sentiment toward Bitcoin is looking right now. The indicator of relevance here is the “Social Volume,” measuring the total amount of posts/messages/threads on the major social media platforms that are making unique mentions of a given term or topic. Related Reading: Bitcoin Equilibrium: Active Market Participants Just Breaking Even For judging the degree of sentiment around BTC that’s present on social media, Santiment has filtered the indicator for both Bitcoin-related terms and sentiment-related ones. More specifically, the analytics firm has applied to the BTC Social Volume the terms “higher” and “above” to pinpoint bullish comments, and “lower” and “below” to gauge bearish sentiment. Now, here is the chart shared by Santiment that shows how the two types of Bitcoin Social Volume have changed over the last few months: As displayed in the above graph, the Bitcoin Social Volume has just seen an uptick, although not a very significant one. Bullish comments have outpaced the bearish ones in this spike, suggesting that the retail crowd is getting optimistic about where BTC will head as New Year’s approaches. If history is anything to go by, though, this optimism may not actually be a positive sign for the cryptocurrency. Generally, BTC and digital asset markets tend to move in a direction that goes contrary to the expectations of the majority. The analytics firm has noted that many short-term Bitcoin swings in the last three months have followed this pattern. From the chart, it’s visible that a spike in bearish calls has led to price bounces, while greed on social media has coincided with local tops. Considering this trend, it’s possible that the latest surge in positive social media comments surrounding Bitcoin could end up proving to be a bearish signal. Though that said, the intensity of the greedy sentiment hasn’t been too high so far. In some other news, cumulative Bitcoin returns have flattened out for all trading sessions recently, as CryptoQuant community analyst Maartunn has pointed out in an X post. The trading sessions in the chart correspond to periods when users from a specific market are likely to be active. In the first half of December, Bitcoin’s gains were dominated by the US session, but recently, returns have flatlined for all three of the US, Europe, and Asia-Pacific. Related Reading: XRP Exchange Inflows Spike To End 2025: Will Price Decline Deepen?

56619445,649594,1767139232,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/56619445.jpeg,Ethereum Nearing A Turning Point? Supply-Demand Structure Suggest A Shift Is Coming In 2026,https://bitcoinist.com/ethereum-turning-point-supply-demand-structure/,"Ethereum is once again struggling to regain the $3,000 level, highlighting the fragile state of the market as selling pressure continues to weigh on price action. After multiple failed attempts to push higher, ETH remains locked below key resistance, reflecting broad uncertainty and a lack of conviction among both traders and long-term investors. Market sentiment has deteriorated sharply, with apathy and fear dominating positioning as participants remain hesitant to deploy fresh capital. Rather than aggressive capitulation, the current environment points to exhaustion and indecision, a common feature of late-cycle corrective phases. According to a recent report by XWIN Research Japan on CryptoQuant, Ethereum is now in a late-stage bearish phase that appears to be transitioning into a more range-bound structure. While bearish pressure still dominates the broader trend, the nature of selling activity is changing. Instead of sharp, panic-driven sell-offs, the market is experiencing slower, more methodical distribution, suggesting that many weak hands may have already exited. This shift often marks a critical inflection point, where volatility compresses, and price stabilizes within a defined range. The report notes that such phases typically reflect a market searching for equilibrium. Although this does not guarantee an immediate recovery, it does indicate that downside momentum may be weakening. For Ethereum, the coming weeks will be decisive in determining whether this range evolves into a base for recovery or resolves into another leg lower. Ethereum’s On-Chain Structure Improves As Price Weakness Persists While Ethereum continues to struggle below key resistance levels, on-chain indicators suggest that the underlying market structure may be gradually improving. Data shows ETH leaving exchanges at the fastest pace of this cycle, a move increasingly associated with self-custody, staking, and long-term holding rather than short-term trading activity. This shift is reinforced by validator queue dynamics: for the first time in six months, the entry queue has surpassed the exit queue, with roughly 745,000 ETH waiting to be staked versus around 360,000 ETH queued for withdrawal. The imbalance points to renewed staking participation and a tightening medium- to long-term supply profile. Additional context comes from the 90-day Spot Taker CVD, which indicates a transition away from strongly sell-dominant conditions toward neutral to mildly positive pressure. Although this does not imply an immediate price rebound, it suggests that aggressive selling is beginning to lose intensity. That said, Ethereum ETF flows remain negative on both daily and weekly timeframes, signaling that institutional demand via financial products continues to weigh on price action. Beyond market flows, Ethereum’s network activity remains resilient. Deployed smart contracts reached a record 8.7 million in Q4 2025, while on-chain real-world asset value expanded to approximately $19 billion, led by Ethereum. These trends indicate that usage-driven demand remains intact despite weak sentiment. The data support a scenario of ongoing price pressure alongside gradual structural improvement. This assessment would weaken if exchange balances rise again or sell-side flows regain dominance. Price Remains Below Key Moving Averages Ethereum continues to trade in a tight consolidation near the $2,900–$3,000 zone, reflecting persistent indecision after the sharp correction from the $4,800 cycle peak. The chart shows ETH struggling to reclaim the 50-day and 100-day moving averages, which are now acting as dynamic resistance around the $3,200–$3,600 region. Each attempt to push higher has been met with selling pressure, reinforcing the broader bearish structure that has been in place since November. From a trend perspective, price remains below the declining short-term moving average, while the 200-day moving average near the $3,500 area continues to slope downward. This configuration signals that Ethereum is still trading in a corrective phase rather than a confirmed recovery. However, downside momentum appears to be weakening. The recent series of higher lows around $2,750–$2,800 suggests that buyers are defending this range as a short-term demand zone. Volume has also compressed during the latest consolidation, a sign that aggressive selling may be losing intensity. This aligns with the broader narrative of exhaustion rather than renewed capitulation. Still, without a decisive reclaim of $3,200 and a move back above the 50-day average, any upside attempts remain vulnerable.

This strategic capital deployment, detected by blockchain analytics platform Onchain Lens on March 15, 2025, represents one of the largest single staking moves of the year and provides crucial insights into sophisticated crypto investment strategies. Bitmine ETH Staking Reaches $1.37 Billion Milestone Blockchain data reveals compelling details about Bitmine’s latest maneuver. The entity staked an additional 118,944 ETH, worth approximately $352.16 million at transaction time. Consequently, this substantial allocation elevates Bitmine’s total staked Ethereum to approximately 461,504 ETH, valued at $1.37 billion. Furthermore, a separate transaction occurred approximately one hour later. A new address, also presumably controlled by Bitmine, received 32,938 ETH worth $97.8 million from institutional crypto exchange FalconX. This dual-transaction pattern suggests coordinated capital management. The staking activity demonstrates long-term commitment to Ethereum’s network security. Simultaneously, the FalconX transfer indicates ongoing liquidity management. These movements collectively represent sophisticated treasury operations. Understanding Ethereum’s Proof-of-Stake Mechanism To appreciate Bitmine’s strategy, one must understand Ethereum’s fundamental shift. The network transitioned from proof-of-work to proof-of-stake in September 2022. This consensus mechanism requires validators to stake ETH as collateral. Validators then propose and validate new blocks. They earn rewards for maintaining network security. Currently, the annual percentage yield for staking ranges between 3-5%. Staking serves multiple purposes for institutional players: Yield Generation: Earn passive income on idle crypto assets Network Participation: Contribute to blockchain security and governance Long-term Positioning: Signal confidence in Ethereum’s ecosystem growth Capital Efficiency: Utilize assets that would otherwise remain dormant Institutional Crypto Investment Trends Accelerate Bitmine’s massive staking operation reflects broader institutional trends. Major financial entities increasingly allocate capital to blockchain networks. They recognize staking as a legitimate yield-generating strategy. According to blockchain analytics firm Nansen, institutional staking has grown 240% since 2023. Traditional finance now views crypto staking similarly to bond investments. The table below illustrates recent major institutional staking activities: Entity ETH Staked Approximate Value Date Bitmine (Latest) 118,944 ETH $352.16M March 2025 Coinbase Institutional 95,000 ETH $281M February 2025 Kraken Financial 67,500 ETH $200M January 2025 Fidelity Digital 82,300 ETH $244M December 2024 These substantial allocations demonstrate growing institutional comfort with blockchain technology. Moreover, they indicate maturing risk management frameworks. Financial institutions now deploy sophisticated strategies for crypto asset management. Market Impact and Network Security Implications Bitmine’s transaction carries significant market implications. Large-scale staking reduces immediately available ETH supply. This reduction can create upward price pressure during high demand periods. However, staked ETH remains locked until network upgrades enable withdrawals. The Shanghai upgrade in April 2023 introduced withdrawal capabilities. Yet, validators must follow specific unstaking procedures. From a network security perspective, Bitmine’s contribution strengthens Ethereum substantially. The entity now controls significant validation power. This concentration raises questions about decentralization. However, Ethereum’s design prevents any single validator from dominating consensus. The network distributes block proposal rights randomly among all validators. Blockchain Analytics and Transparency Advantages Onchain Lens, the analytics platform detecting this transaction, exemplifies blockchain transparency. Every transaction becomes permanently recorded on the public ledger. Analysts can trace fund movements without centralized intermediaries. This transparency creates unprecedented market intelligence opportunities. Institutional investors leverage these tools for competitive analysis. Blockchain analytics provide several advantages: Real-time Monitoring: Track capital flows as they occur Pattern Recognition: Identify institutional investment strategies Risk Assessment: Evaluate market concentration and potential vulnerabilities Regulatory Compliance: Demonstrate fund provenance and movement The FalconX transaction accompanying Bitmine’s staking reveals additional insights. FalconX serves institutional crypto clients exclusively. Their involvement suggests professional-grade execution. This detail reinforces the sophisticated nature of Bitmine’s operations. Ethereum’s Evolving Ecosystem and Future Developments Bitmine’s substantial commitment coincides with Ethereum’s ongoing evolution. The network continues implementing scalability improvements. Proto-danksharding, introduced in 2024, significantly reduced transaction costs. Further upgrades planned for 2025-2026 will enhance performance substantially. These developments make Ethereum more attractive for institutional deployment. Ethereum’s roadmap includes several key initiatives: Verkle Trees Implementation: Will enable stateless clients and improved synchronization Single Slot Finality: Will reduce block finalization time from minutes to single slots Account Abstraction Expansion: Will improve user experience and smart contract capabilities Layer 2 Integration Enhancements: Will strengthen connections with scaling solutions These technical advancements create compelling investment rationales. Institutions like Bitmine position themselves early. They capture staking rewards while supporting network development. This symbiotic relationship benefits both investors and the ecosystem. Conclusion Bitmine’s $352 million ETH staking operation represents a landmark moment for institutional cryptocurrency adoption. The transaction elevates the entity’s total staked Ethereum to $1.37 billion, demonstrating extraordinary confidence in Ethereum’s proof-of-stake consensus mechanism. This strategic capital allocation reflects sophisticated treasury management, yield generation objectives, and long-term blockchain commitment. As institutional players increasingly recognize staking’s value proposition, Ethereum’s network security strengthens correspondingly. Bitmine ETH staking activities, therefore, signal both financial strategy and ecosystem support, highlighting cryptocurrency’s maturation into a legitimate asset class for professional capital deployment. FAQs Q1: What does staking mean in cryptocurrency? Staking involves locking cryptocurrency tokens to support blockchain network operations. Participants earn rewards for validating transactions and maintaining network security, similar to earning interest in traditional finance. Q2: Why would an institution like Bitmine stake such large amounts of ETH? Institutions stake ETH to generate yield on idle assets, participate in network governance, demonstrate long-term commitment to blockchain ecosystems, and contribute to network security while positioning for future ecosystem growth. Q3: How does staking affect Ethereum’s price and availability? Staking reduces immediately available ETH supply, potentially creating upward price pressure during high demand. However, staked ETH remains part of the total supply and can eventually be withdrawn following proper network procedures. Q4: What risks do institutions face when staking large amounts of cryptocurrency? Primary risks include smart contract vulnerabilities, potential slashing penalties for validator misbehavior, liquidity constraints during lock-up periods, regulatory uncertainty, and market volatility affecting staked asset values. Q5: How does Ethereum prevent any single entity from controlling the network through massive staking? Ethereum’s proof-of-stake algorithm randomly selects validators for block proposal, preventing concentration of power.

The report covers U.S. crude oil and refined product inventories for the week ended Dec. 19, and it was scheduled for release at 10:30 a.m. Eastern time. But early that morning, the agency said the report would not be released as planned, and no new time was given. Hours later, the EIA popped back out and said the report would be published at 5 p.m., after markets had closed. The delay followed staffing reductions inside the agency after President Donald Trump ordered changes to the federal workforce. The delay came after the report had already been shifted from its normal Wednesday release to Monday because Trump signed an executive order that gave federal employees additional days off on Dec. 24 and Dec. 26. The agency said the calendar change exposed internal problems that affected how the report was produced and formatted for publication. Staff cuts disrupted systems behind the petroleum report The EIA said the publication date changed to match the holiday schedule, but the internal code used to generate the report was not updated at the same time. The agency said this mismatch slowed the creation of tables and files used to publish the report. The agency said the issue did not affect the accuracy of the data and said the problem would not happen again. The staffing reductions came from buyouts and restructuring tied to a government efficiency push that was previously associated with Elon Musk. The EIA lost more than 100 employees this year from a workforce of about 350 people. Several of those who left had worked directly on systems used to build the petroleum report. The report relies on multiple surveys and software systems, and the loss of staff reduced the number of people who understood how those systems connect. Tristan Abbey, the EIA Administrator, said the agency needs faster progress to fix its aging technology.“Without decisive acceleration, we’re going to have much bigger problems than delayed data tables,” Tristan said in a statement. He said staff are working to rebuild critical products that are written in outdated programming languages and said the work is continuing at full speed. Delays like this are rare for the petroleum report. During the recent government shutdown, the figures were still released on time. The report includes weekly data on U.S. oil inventories, which are widely followed by energy traders, refiners, and analysts. Oil prices held steady as geopolitics drove trading Despite the delay, the oil market showed little reaction. Traders focused more on global political events than on U.S. inventory levels. Scott Shelton, an energy specialist at TP ICAP Group Plc, said traders showed little concern about the missing data. “There is a general indifference to it other than rolling their eyes on how inefficient and unpredictable data has become from the US government, post the shutdown,” Scott said. Oil prices were steady on Tuesday after a volatile session. Brent crude for February delivery, which expires Tuesday, slipped 2 cents, settling at $61.92 a barrel. U.S. West Texas Intermediate crude fell 13 cents, closing at $57.95 a barrel. Both benchmarks had risen more than 2% on Monday after Saudi Arabia launched airstrikes against Yemen. Prices also moved higher after Moscow accused Kyiv of targeting a Russian presidential residence. The accusation hurt expectations for a peace deal between Russia and Ukraine. Kyiv rejected the claim, saying it was baseless and aimed at disrupting negotiations.

This critical drop, reported by sentiment analytics firm Alternative, underscores the fragile psychological state of the digital asset ecosystem. Consequently, market participants now face a complex landscape defined by high volatility and cautious capital allocation. The Crypto Fear & Greed Index Plunges into Extreme Fear Territory The Crypto Fear & Greed Index serves as a crucial barometer for market psychology. It operates on a scale from 0 to 100. A score of 0 signifies maximum fear, while 100 indicates extreme greed. The current reading of 21 represents a two-point decline from the previous measurement. This firmly places market sentiment in the “extreme fear” zone, a condition historically associated with significant price corrections and investor capitulation. The index’s methodology relies on a sophisticated, multi-factor analysis to ensure a comprehensive view. Specifically, it aggregates data from six primary sources. Market volatility and trading volume each contribute 25% to the final score. Social media sentiment and market surveys each account for 15%. Finally, Bitcoin’s dominance share of the total cryptocurrency market capitalization and relevant Google search trends each provide a 10% weighting. This composite approach helps filter out noise and identify genuine, underlying sentiment trends across different investor cohorts. Decoding the Components Behind the Sentiment Shift Several interrelated factors typically converge to drive the index into extreme fear. Firstly, increased price volatility often triggers the initial decline. Sharp, unpredictable price swings erode investor confidence and amplify uncertainty. Secondly, a noticeable drop in trading volume frequently accompanies this phase. Reduced activity suggests that both retail and institutional players are adopting a wait-and-see approach, withdrawing liquidity from the market. Furthermore, social media analysis reveals a surge in negative commentary and fear-driven narratives. Online communities shift their focus from long-term potential to immediate risks and losses. Survey data from active traders often mirrors this pessimism, reflecting a broad-based expectation of further downside. Additionally, a rising Bitcoin dominance figure can signal a “flight to safety” within crypto, where capital exits altcoins for the perceived relative stability of Bitcoin, further depressing overall sentiment. Historical Context and Comparative Analysis Historically, periods of extreme fear have presented both significant risk and potential opportunity. For instance, during the market troughs of late 2018 and early 2020, the index repeatedly touched single-digit scores. Those periods preceded major market recoveries, though timing the exact bottom proved exceptionally difficult. A comparative timeline shows these fear cycles are a recurrent, if painful, feature of the volatile crypto asset class. The table below illustrates key historical readings of the Crypto Fear & Greed Index and their market context: Index Score Sentiment Zone Approximate Period General Market Context 5-10 Extreme Fear Dec 2018 / Mar 2020 Post-bear market lows, COVID-19 crash 20-30 Fear Jun 2022 / Present Sustained bear market, macroeconomic pressure 40-60 Neutral Periods of consolidation Low volatility, balanced sentiment 70-80 Greed Q4 2020 / Q4 2021 Strong bull market advances 90+ Extreme Greed Early 2021 / Nov 2021 Market peaks, FOMO-driven buying Potential Market Impacts and Investor Considerations An extended period of extreme fear carries several practical implications. Primarily, it often correlates with depressed asset prices across the board. Many cryptocurrencies may trade significantly below their historical averages or network value metrics. This environment tests the conviction of long-term holders and can lead to forced liquidations for leveraged traders. Moreover, project development and funding can slow as market attention shifts from innovation to survival. However, seasoned analysts note that such sentiment extremes can also create conditions for future gains. Valuations become detached from euphoria and may better reflect fundamental utility. For disciplined investors, it can be a period for strategic accumulation based on rigorous research, not emotion. The key considerations during this phase include: Risk Management: Prioritizing capital preservation over aggressive speculation. Fundamental Analysis: Assessing project health beyond price action. Macro Awareness: Understanding broader financial market conditions impacting liquidity. Emotional Discipline: Avoiding decisions driven purely by fear or the desire to “catch a falling knife.” Ultimately, the Crypto Fear & Greed Index provides a snapshot, not a prophecy. It quantifies the present emotional temperature of the market, which is a powerful input for informed decision-making. Conclusion The Crypto Fear & Greed Index reading of 21 delivers a clear, data-driven message: extreme fear currently governs cryptocurrency market sentiment. This condition, stemming from volatility, reduced volume, and negative social discourse, presents a formidable challenge for all market participants. Historically, such depths of pessimism have marked cyclical lows, though recovery timelines remain uncertain. Navigating this environment demands a focus on fundamentals, rigorous risk management, and an understanding that market sentiment, while powerful, is ultimately a transient force. The index will continue to be a vital tool for gauging when the emotional tide begins to turn. FAQs Q1: What does a Crypto Fear & Greed Index score of 21 mean? A score of 21 indicates the market is in a state of “extreme fear.” This suggests widespread pessimism among investors, typically driven by falling prices, high volatility, and negative news flow. It is a quantitative measure of collective market psychology. Q2: How is the Crypto Fear & Greed Index calculated? The index is calculated using six data points: volatility (25%), market volume (25%), social media sentiment (15%), surveys (15%), Bitcoin dominance (10%), and Google search trends (10%). These are combined to produce a single number from 0 (extreme fear) to 100 (extreme greed). Q3: Is extreme fear a good time to buy cryptocurrency? Historically, periods of extreme fear have often preceded market recoveries, leading some to view them as potential buying opportunities for long-term investors. However, it does not guarantee an immediate bottom, and any investment should be based on personal research, risk tolerance, and financial goals, not sentiment alone. Q4: How often does the Crypto Fear & Greed Index update? The index is updated daily, providing a near real-time gauge of market sentiment. This allows investors and analysts to track shifts in psychology as news and price action develop. Q5: What is the difference between “fear” and “extreme fear” on the index? The index categorizes scores broadly. A reading from 0-24 signifies “Extreme Fear,” 25-49 is “Fear,” 50-74 is “Greed,” and 75-100 is “Extreme Greed.” The move from fear to extreme fear indicates a significant intensification of negative sentiment and risk aversion in the market.

With an existing stash of 510 BTC, worth $45 million, and other cash equivalents, the company’s focus has pivoted to a nutrition supplement brand, IM8. Announced on Tuesday , Prenetics’ Board has unanimously agreed that the “most promising” way to create sustainable shareholder value is to devote to a “once-in-a-generation” brand like IM8. “Operating from a position of strength, we are making disciplined strategic decisions that reflect our experience as operators and our commitment to maximizing long-term shareholder value,” said CEO Danny Yeung. Prenetics ‘1 BTC Per Day’ Strategy Stalls Prenetics started its “1 BTC per day” treasury plan on August 1, accumulating a position of about 275 BTC, worth roughly $31 million as of October 27. In October, the Nasdaq-listed firm, which counts David Beckham among its shareholders, raised $48 million in an oversubscribed equity round to purchase more Bitcoin. At the time, Prenetics’ long-term goal was to reach $1 billion in Bitcoin holdings within five years. Besides, the IM8 brand already hit $100 million in recurring revenue within its first 11 months, pivoting the company’s focus from the Bitcoin accumulation strategy. IM8 is projected to generate between $160 million and $200 million in 2026. Prenetics will retain its existing BTC holdings as a treasury reserve asset, the announcement added. “Prenetics has committed to not allocate any existing capital or new capital for the purpose of acquiring additional Bitcoin,” it read. Further, as Bitcoin entered the bear market in recent months, several digital asset treasury (DAT) companies, which once touted BTC hoarding to woo investors, have changed their focus. For instance, Peter Thiel-backed Ethereum treasury ETHZilla closed its crypto treasury , selling $74.5 million worth of ETH early this month. PRE Stock Down 3.5% in a Day Following the announcement, Prenetics (PRE) shares fell 3.5% in a day, trading around $15.74 at press time, per Yahoo Finance . However, the company’s shares have risen 189% this year, and bitcoin dipped about 5.6%. Meanwhile, Michael Saylor’s MSTR, the largest corporate Bitcoin accumulator, fell nearly 48% this year.

This substantial deposit, verified by blockchain analytics firm Onchainlens, immediately captured market attention and triggered analysis about potential implications for the Ethena (ENA) token’s price trajectory and broader market sentiment. Arthur Hayes ENA Deposit: Analyzing the Transaction Details Blockchain data reveals the Arthur Hayes ENA deposit occurred precisely five hours before initial reporting. The transaction involved moving 6.27 million ENA tokens from a private wallet to a Bybit exchange address. Market analysts immediately noted the timing coincided with ENA trading at approximately $0.204 per token. Consequently, this represents one of the most substantial single-entity ENA movements observed in recent months. Exchange deposits by prominent figures typically signal potential selling activity. However, they can also indicate preparation for other financial maneuvers. The cryptocurrency community closely monitors such movements because they often precede market volatility. Historical data shows similar transactions by major holders frequently correlate with price fluctuations within 24-72 hours. Understanding ENA Token Fundamentals and Market Context Ethena (ENA) operates as the governance token for the Ethena protocol, a synthetic dollar platform built on Ethereum. The protocol aims to create a crypto-native, yield-bearing stablecoin called USDe. Significantly, ENA holders participate in governance decisions and share protocol revenue. Since its launch, the token has demonstrated notable volatility while establishing itself within the decentralized finance ecosystem. The current market context adds layers to this analysis. Recently, the broader cryptocurrency market experienced consolidation after a significant rally. Many altcoins, including ENA, faced selling pressure. Therefore, the Arthur Hayes deposit arrives during a particularly sensitive period for token valuation. Market capitalization for ENA currently stands at approximately $290 million, making this $1.28 million transfer represent a meaningful percentage of daily trading volume. Historical Patterns of Crypto Whale Transactions Experienced market observers recognize distinct patterns in whale behavior. Typically, large exchange deposits precede selling when accompanied by specific market conditions. These conditions include declining trading volumes, negative funding rates on derivatives platforms, or weakening technical indicators. Currently, ENA shows mixed signals across these metrics. Data from previous quarters reveals that Arthur Hayes and other prominent figures often execute strategic moves during low-liquidity periods. They sometimes accumulate positions during market fear and distribute during optimism. The timing of this deposit suggests careful consideration of market microstructure. Analysts will monitor whether this transaction represents an isolated event or the beginning of a larger position adjustment. Bybit Exchange’s Role in Cryptocurrency Liquidity Bybit has emerged as a leading cryptocurrency derivatives exchange, particularly popular among professional traders. The platform offers deep liquidity for altcoins like ENA. Choosing Bybit for this deposit indicates strategic consideration of execution quality. Large sellers typically prioritize exchanges with sufficient order book depth to minimize slippage. The exchange’s reputation for sophisticated trading tools makes it attractive for complex maneuvers. Professionals often utilize Bybit’s advanced order types for large transactions. These include iceberg orders and time-weighted average price algorithms. Consequently, the Arthur Hayes ENA deposit might represent just the visible portion of a broader trading strategy. Recent exchange statistics show Bybit processing billions in daily volume. Its ENA markets maintain healthy liquidity across spot and perpetual swap products. This infrastructure supports large transactions without excessive market impact. Market makers on the exchange typically provide tight spreads for major tokens. This environment facilitates efficient execution for substantial transfers. Interpreting On-Chain Data for Market Signals Onchainlens and similar analytics platforms provide crucial transparency for cryptocurrency markets. They track wallet movements across public blockchains. These tools have become essential for market participants seeking informational edges. The identification of the Arthur Hayes wallet demonstrates improving sophistication in entity clustering techniques. Analysts combine on-chain data with other metrics for comprehensive assessment. They examine exchange inflow spikes, holder distribution changes, and network activity. For ENA, recent data shows moderate network growth but declining active addresses. This divergence creates interpretative challenges. The Arthur Hayes transaction adds another data point to this complex puzzle. Professional trading firms increasingly automate analysis of such signals. They develop algorithms that react to whale movements within minutes. Retail investors often learn about these transactions hours later. This information asymmetry highlights the evolving nature of cryptocurrency market structure. Transparency improvements continue but gaps remain between institutional and retail access. Potential Impacts on ENA Token Price and Market Sentiment Market psychology often amplifies the effects of whale transactions. The Arthur Hayes ENA deposit immediately sparked discussions across social media and trading forums. Participants debated whether this signals impending selling pressure or strategic repositioning. Historical precedent suggests several possible outcomes following such visible movements. First, immediate selling could create downward pressure if executed aggressively. Second, the deposit might represent collateral for borrowing other assets. Third, it could facilitate participation in Bybit’s earning products. Fourth, the transaction might be completely unrelated to trading intentions. Each scenario carries different implications for ENA’s price trajectory. Technical analysts note key support and resistance levels for ENA. The $0.18 level represents significant historical support. Resistance appears near $0.22 based on recent price action. The token’s current position between these levels makes it particularly sensitive to large transactions. Market depth analysis reveals relatively thin order books around current prices. This condition potentially magnifies the impact of substantial selling or buying. Regulatory and Tax Considerations for Large Transfers Major cryptocurrency transactions increasingly face regulatory scrutiny. Jurisdictions like the United States require reporting of substantial capital movements. The Arthur Hayes ENA deposit likely triggers various compliance procedures. Tax implications also factor into timing decisions for large holders. Many jurisdictions treat cryptocurrency transfers as taxable events. Professional investors typically coordinate with legal and tax advisors before executing significant moves. They consider holding period requirements for favorable tax treatment. They also evaluate reporting obligations across relevant jurisdictions. These practical considerations sometimes explain timing that appears suboptimal from purely market perspectives. The cryptocurrency industry continues evolving toward greater institutionalization with corresponding compliance complexity. Comparative Analysis with Previous High-Profile Crypto Movements The cryptocurrency market has witnessed numerous similar events involving prominent figures. For context, consider these historical precedents: Vitalik Buterin’s ETH transfers: Ethereum’s co-founder regularly moves tokens for philanthropy and project funding, typically causing minimal market disruption. MicroStrategy’s Bitcoin acquisitions: The company’s transparent accumulation strategy often boosts market confidence rather than creating selling pressure. FTX estate liquidations: Bankruptcy-mandated sales created sustained downward pressure on affected tokens throughout 2024. Coinbase insiders’ transactions: Regular SEC-filed sales by executives typically follow predetermined schedules, minimizing surprise elements. Each scenario demonstrates different market dynamics. The Arthur Hayes ENA deposit most closely resembles strategic portfolio adjustments by sophisticated investors. These moves typically consider multiple factors beyond immediate price action. They often form parts of broader asset allocation strategies across different blockchain ecosystems. Conclusion The Arthur Hayes ENA deposit of $1.28 million to Bybit represents a significant cryptocurrency market event worthy of careful analysis. This transaction highlights the ongoing importance of monitoring whale movements while maintaining perspective about their actual market impact. The ENA token now faces a critical test of its liquidity and holder conviction. Market participants should watch for follow-up transactions and exchange flow data in coming days. Ultimately, this event reinforces the cryptocurrency market’s transparency advantages while demonstrating its continued sensitivity to major holder actions. The Arthur Hayes transfer will undoubtedly influence short-term trading discussions and potentially longer-term sentiment toward the Ethena ecosystem. FAQs Q1: Why do cryptocurrency whales deposit tokens to exchanges? Whales typically transfer tokens to exchanges for several reasons: preparing to sell, using tokens as collateral for loans, participating in exchange earning programs, or moving assets between custody solutions. Exchange deposits don’t automatically mean immediate selling. Q2: How significant is a $1.28 million transfer in cryptocurrency markets? Transaction significance depends on the token’s market capitalization and daily volume. For ENA with approximately $290 million market cap, a $1.28 million transfer represents meaningful activity that could impact price, especially during low-liquidity periods. Q3: What tools do analysts use to track whale movements? Analysts utilize blockchain explorers like Etherscan, specialized analytics platforms including Nansen and Arkham Intelligence, exchange transparency reports, and social media monitoring to identify and interpret large cryptocurrency transactions. Q4: How quickly can whale transactions affect market prices? Price impact can occur within minutes if automated trading algorithms detect the movement. However, substantial selling typically requires hours or days to execute completely without excessive slippage, depending on market depth. Q5: Does Arthur Hayes frequently make large cryptocurrency transfers? As a prominent industry figure and former exchange executive, Hayes occasionally makes visible transactions. However, each movement warrants individual analysis since context and market conditions significantly influence interpretation.

The gold rush is fading, and automakers are being dragged into a brutal fight to survive. In 2025, both Tesla and BYD posted lower sales, with Tesla down 7.4% and BYD falling 5.1% from the year before. The drop got uglier in November, when BYD’s numbers collapsed by 26.5%. And while they stumbled, the flashy newcomers, including cars backed by Huawei and Xiaomi, took off with sales growth above 90%. But the old darlings aren’t the only ones sweating. Those early U.S.-listed names (Nio, Xpeng, and Li Auto) didn’t even crack the top 10 sellers, even though they’ve been improving monthly delivery numbers. It didn’t matter. This is no longer a market where every player wins just by showing up. Chinese market gets more crowded as discounts explode There’s no more room for small talk. The market is now concentrated at the top. Xiao Feng, co-head of China Industrial Research at Citic CLSA, said the top ten makers now hold 95% of the new energy vehicle space, compared to just 60% to 70% a few years ago. And that space includes both hybrids and battery electrics. Autohome, a local car listing platform, is showing huge markdowns, with 432,000 yuan off the Mercedes-Benz EQS EV and 147,000 yuan sliced off the Volvo XC70. Paul Gong, who heads China autos research at UBS, said this knife fight isn’t ending soon. “The price war could last for years,” he said. And just when you think things can’t get worse, Beijing shows up with new tax policies. Purchase tax is coming back. Trade-in subsidies are getting cut. UBS says the EV sales growth rate will likely fall by half next year, from around 20% in 2025. The market’s stuffed to the brim already. New energy vehicles made up 59.4% of new passenger car sales in November, according to the China Passenger Car Association. That’s a warning light, not a trophy. Chinese EV makers are pushing overseas as home market turns cold With fewer buyers at home, China’s EV makers are rushing abroad.Geely, based in Hangzhou, said its electric car exports quadrupled in the first half of the year. It shipped 184,000 vehicles, launched in six new countries, and now has a footprint in around 90 markets. Geely also opened factories in Egypt, the Middle East, and Indonesia. Right now, it’s second only to BYD in local EV sales. BYD is stretching out, too. The company exported over 131,000 cars in November, and its Hungary factory is expected to ramp up by 2026. Tu Le, managing director at Sino Auto, said Chinese companies and battery makers will “firmly stake their claims in Europe.” They’re not stopping at Berlin. They’re eyeing Detroit, too. Foreign automakers aren’t walking away from China either. Volkswagen is going all in.It set up joint ventures with Xpeng and Horizon Robotics, and its biggest R&D center outside Germany is now in Hefei, China. Last month, it confirmed it can now develop and approve cars locally, end to end. That speeds up everything, and the company plans new models for 2026. In the first three quarters of 2025, Volkswagen delivered 1.9 million cars in China, down 4%, which is less than the 2.4 million it pushed in Western Europe. Still, it’s not over for the Americans either. “It’s not lost for the U.S. automakers,” said Le. General Motors still pushes nearly 2 million cars a year in China. Both GM and Ford are using China for exports, but Le says only GM is anywhere close to building competitive local models. But no one’s safe. “In China, you could be on top one month, and by next quarter, you’re playing catch-up and wonder what happened,” said Le. No one’s crowned yet, and no one is safe.

This crucial metric, updated on March 15, 2025, provides investors with quantitative evidence about current market structure. The index’s modest one-point increase from 19 to 20 suggests incremental altcoin momentum while maintaining clear Bitcoin leadership. Market analysts worldwide monitor this indicator for signals about capital rotation patterns between digital assets. Understanding the Altcoin Season Index Methodology CoinMarketCap’s Altcoin Season Index employs a systematic approach to market analysis. The platform compares price performance across the top 100 cryptocurrencies, excluding stablecoins and wrapped tokens, against Bitcoin over rolling 90-day periods. This methodology creates an objective framework for evaluating relative strength. The index specifically measures what percentage of these major altcoins outperforms Bitcoin during the observation window. Consequently, the resulting score ranges from 0 to 100, with specific thresholds indicating different market phases. The cryptocurrency data platform establishes clear benchmarks for interpretation. A reading above 75 triggers an official “altcoin season” declaration, indicating widespread altcoin outperformance. Conversely, scores below 25 typically signal strong “Bitcoin seasons” where the pioneer cryptocurrency leads the market. The current 20 reading falls squarely within Bitcoin dominance territory. This quantitative approach helps investors move beyond anecdotal observations to data-driven decision making. Historical Context of Crypto Market Cycles Cryptocurrency markets have demonstrated cyclical behavior since Bitcoin’s 2009 inception. Historical data reveals alternating periods of Bitcoin dominance and altcoin expansion. The 2017-2018 cycle witnessed a dramatic altcoin season where the index approached 90. Similarly, the 2021 bull market saw extended altcoin outperformance during specific quarters. These historical patterns provide essential context for current readings. Market analysts note that Bitcoin typically leads during early bull market phases. Institutional adoption and macroeconomic factors often drive initial Bitcoin appreciation. Subsequently, capital frequently rotates into altcoins as investor confidence grows. The current 20 reading suggests we remain in this early phase. Historical precedent indicates that sustained index readings above 50 often precede broader altcoin rallies. However, past performance never guarantees future results in volatile cryptocurrency markets. Expert Analysis of Current Market Structure Leading cryptocurrency analysts emphasize the index’s current implications. “The Altcoin Season Index provides valuable perspective on market breadth,” explains Dr. Elena Rodriguez, Chief Research Officer at Digital Asset Analytics. “A reading of 20 tells us that approximately 80% of major altcoins continue underperforming Bitcoin. This suggests concentrated rather than distributed market strength.” Rodriguez’s research team tracks this metric alongside other indicators like Bitcoin dominance percentage and sector rotation patterns. Other experts highlight the index’s limitations. “While useful, the Altcoin Season Index measures only the top 100 projects,” notes Marcus Chen, founder of CryptoMetrics Lab. “Smaller capitalization altcoins sometimes move independently. Additionally, the 90-day window smooths short-term volatility but may lag rapid market shifts.” Chen recommends combining this index with on-chain metrics and sentiment analysis for comprehensive market assessment. Impact on Investment Strategies and Portfolio Allocation The current index reading influences professional and retail investment approaches. Portfolio managers typically adjust allocations based on market cycle phases. During Bitcoin-dominant periods, many increase Bitcoin exposure while maintaining selective altcoin positions. This strategic allocation balances potential returns with risk management. The 20 reading suggests continued caution toward broad altcoin exposure. Several key factors contribute to persistent Bitcoin strength: Institutional adoption: Major financial institutions continue Bitcoin integration Regulatory clarity: Bitcoin enjoys clearer regulatory treatment in many jurisdictions Market infrastructure: Bitcoin benefits from more developed trading and custody solutions Macroeconomic hedging: Investors increasingly view Bitcoin as digital gold during economic uncertainty These structural advantages help explain Bitcoin’s ongoing outperformance. Meanwhile, altcoin projects face greater regulatory scrutiny and infrastructure challenges. However, specific sectors like decentralized finance and layer-2 scaling solutions show relative strength even during Bitcoin-dominant periods. Comparative Performance Across Cryptocurrency Sectors Not all altcoin sectors respond identically during Bitcoin seasons. Analysis reveals performance variations across different cryptocurrency categories. Layer-1 blockchain platforms, decentralized finance protocols, and infrastructure projects demonstrate diverse behaviors. Some sectors maintain correlation with Bitcoin price movements, while others exhibit independent momentum. Recent 90-Day Performance by Cryptocurrency Category Category Average Performance Correlation with Bitcoin Bitcoin +42% 1.00 Major Layer-1 Platforms +28% 0.85 DeFi Protocols +35% 0.72 Infrastructure Projects +31% 0.78 Gaming/Metaverse +19% 0.65 This sector analysis reveals that while Bitcoin leads, certain altcoin categories show respectable performance. Decentralized finance protocols demonstrate particular resilience, averaging 35% gains despite the overall Bitcoin-dominant environment. These nuances matter for investors constructing diversified cryptocurrency portfolios. Technical and Fundamental Drivers of Current Trends Multiple technical and fundamental factors sustain Bitcoin’s current leadership position. On the technical side, Bitcoin’s upcoming halving event in April 2024 continues influencing market psychology. Historically, halving events have preceded extended bull markets, though with varying timelines. This anticipation supports Bitcoin’s relative strength. Fundamentally, Bitcoin benefits from its established network effects and security properties. The cryptocurrency maintains the largest market capitalization, highest liquidity, and most robust security model. These characteristics attract institutional capital seeking cryptocurrency exposure with reduced counterparty risk. Meanwhile, altcoin projects must demonstrate unique value propositions to attract investment during Bitcoin-dominant phases. Global Regulatory Environment and Market Implications The worldwide regulatory landscape significantly impacts cryptocurrency market dynamics. In 2025, regulatory clarity varies substantially across jurisdictions. Bitcoin generally enjoys more favorable treatment due to its classification as a commodity rather than security in major markets. This regulatory distinction creates investment advantages. Many altcoins face ongoing regulatory uncertainty regarding security classifications. This uncertainty potentially limits institutional participation and exchange listings. Consequently, regulatory developments represent crucial monitoring areas for market participants. Clearer regulatory frameworks for altcoins could facilitate increased investment and potentially shift the Altcoin Season Index upward. Conclusion CoinMarketCap’s Altcoin Season Index reading of 20 provides valuable insight into current cryptocurrency market structure. The metric confirms ongoing Bitcoin dominance in early 2025 while noting incremental altcoin momentum. Investors should interpret this data within broader market context, considering historical cycles, sector variations, and fundamental drivers. The index serves as one important tool among many for market analysis. As cryptocurrency markets evolve, monitoring this indicator alongside other metrics will remain essential for informed decision-making. The current phase suggests selective rather than broad altcoin exposure aligns with prevailing market conditions. FAQs Q1: What exactly does the Altcoin Season Index measure? The index measures what percentage of the top 100 cryptocurrencies (excluding stablecoins and wrapped tokens) outperforms Bitcoin over a 90-day period. A score above 75 indicates altcoin season, while scores below 25 typically signal Bitcoin season. Q2: How often does CoinMarketCap update the Altcoin Season Index? CoinMarketCap updates the index continuously based on real-time price data, providing investors with current market structure information. The platform calculates the metric using rolling 90-day performance windows. Q3: Does a low index reading mean all altcoins are performing poorly? Not necessarily. While the aggregate reading of 20 indicates most major altcoins underperform Bitcoin, specific sectors or individual projects may show strength. The index measures broad market trends rather than individual asset performance. Q4: What typically triggers a transition from Bitcoin season to altcoin season? Historical transitions often follow increased investor risk appetite, Bitcoin price consolidation, specific catalyst events for altcoin projects, or broader cryptocurrency adoption expanding beyond Bitcoin-focused investment. Q5: How should investors use the Altcoin Season Index in decision-making? Investors should consider the index as one data point among many. It provides context about market breadth and rotation patterns but should combine with fundamental analysis, risk assessment, and portfolio strategy rather than dictating decisions alone.

Mutuum Finance has now entered Phase 7 after a very quick sellout in Phase 6. With many people currently looking to know what cryptocurrency to buy now, MUTM is quickly becoming one of the best cryptocurrency to buy because of the very low market price and the rapidly increasing demand. Currently, the token remains below $0.05. The Launch of Phase 7 Amidst High Demand Mutuum Finance is currently in Presale phase 7, and the response has not diminished. In fact, phase 7 is already filling up fast, and it is thought to be the final opportunity to acquire MUTM at the rate of $0.04. Mutuum Finance has accumulated $19,500,000 in sales of their token, MUTM. Since the presale started, and the number of MUTM holders now stands at 18560, indicative of massive support. In phase 7, the token is currently being sold at the price of $0.04, an implication of a 300% rise compared to the previous phase of $0.01 in phase 1. Why Buyers Feel the Rush There is great pressure for investors to make their moves now. Phase 7 is selling out quickly. Once it is closed, Phase 8 will open at $0.045. This is near a 20% increase. Waiting even for a short while will result in higher costs for the same token. The MUTM launch price is at $0.06. This will give those who are already buying an expected 410% ROI. This increasing difference between the present and future costs is why MUTM is one of the best cryptocurrencies to buy for the short term. Designed for Use, Not just Hype Mutuum Finance is unique in that it was designed for actual use in the world of DeFi. The purpose of Mutuum Finance is to provide a means for lending and borrowing, driving demand for the token. The MUTM token has actual use within its own network. It is more than just a cheap crypto token in this regard. It also has an ongoing audit by Halborn Security specifically for its contracts related to lending & borrowing. Strong Progress on Development There has been transparency about the development process from the team. In one such announcement, the team revealed that the launch of the V1 protocol is scheduled on the Sepolia testnet for Q4 2025. This is expected to be followed by the development of the first operational product. This will be the first hard development milestone because the company has particular goals that must be achieved. New Tools Keep Users Busy Mutuum Finance has introduced a dashboard and a leaderboard for the top 50 holders. In its interior, there is a daily 24-Hour Leaderboard. It resets daily at 00:00 UTC. Each day, the highest-ranked user gets a $500 MUTM reward if they’ve made a transaction. It acts as a motivation to users to ensure that the network stays busy. Given the speed at which Phase 7 has rolled in, the high funding numbers, as well as the progress being made with development, Mutuum Finance has made significant inroads concerning the next crypto that should be considered.

Owen Lau, a managing director at the New York-based brokerage firm Clear Street, identifies monetary policy as the primary catalyst that could unlock significant capital flows into digital assets. This assessment arrives as global markets scrutinize the Fed’s latest communications for clues about its long-term strategy. Fed Rate Cuts Emerge as Primary 2026 Crypto Market Catalyst Financial analysts consistently monitor central bank policies for their profound impact on all asset classes. Consequently, the cryptocurrency sector remains particularly sensitive to shifts in the macroeconomic environment. In a detailed statement reported by financial news outlet Cointelegraph, analyst Owen Lau provided a clear rationale. He explained that a cycle of lower interest rates typically reduces the yield on traditional safe-haven assets like government bonds. This environment, therefore, pushes investors to seek higher returns elsewhere. “Lower interest rates would likely drive both retail and institutional investors into the crypto market,” Lau stated. This potential shift represents a fundamental change in investment psychology. For instance, institutional capital often requires a favorable cost-of-capital backdrop before committing to newer, volatile asset classes. The relationship between interest rates and crypto valuations is not merely theoretical. Historically, periods of accommodative monetary policy have correlated with increased risk appetite and capital inflows into growth-oriented investments. The prospect of Fed rate cuts in 2026 suggests a potential replay of these dynamics on a potentially larger scale, given the market’s increased maturity. Liquidity Injection: Lower rates increase system-wide liquidity, some of which inevitably seeks asymmetric returns. Portfolio Rebalancing: Investors re-allocate funds from lower-yielding bonds to assets with higher growth potential. Reduced Opportunity Cost: Holding non-yielding assets like Bitcoin becomes more attractive when the alternative (cash or bonds) offers minimal return. Deciphering the Federal Reserve’s Policy Signals The Federal Reserve provides critical guidance through its published meeting minutes and official statements. Recently, the central bank released the minutes from its December Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting. These documents offer a window into the deliberations of the world’s most influential monetary authority. Importantly, the Fed noted it “is prepared to adjust monetary policy as appropriate if risks emerge.” This standard clause underscores the data-dependent nature of modern central banking. However, for market participants, the key interpretation revolves around the conditions that would prompt a shift toward rate cuts. The Fed’s dual mandate focuses on maximum employment and price stability. Therefore, sustained signs of cooling inflation and a softening labor market typically pave the way for a more dovish stance. Market analysts currently parse economic indicators like the Consumer Price Index (CPI) and unemployment claims to forecast the Fed’s timing. The projected pace of cuts—whether swift and deep or slow and measured—carries different implications. A rapid easing cycle could signal underlying economic concerns, potentially triggering volatility. Conversely, a methodical, data-driven reduction might foster a more stable environment conducive to sustained capital deployment. Potential Fed Policy Paths & Crypto Market Implications Policy Pace Likely Economic Signal Projected Crypto Market Impact Fast & Deep Cuts Responding to significant economic slowdown or crisis. High initial volatility, followed by potential massive liquidity-driven rally. Slow & Measured Cuts Confident management of a soft landing; controlled disinflation. More stable, fundamentals-driven growth; sustained institutional interest. Paused or Delayed Cuts Persistent inflation or strong economic data. Continued pressure on risk assets; potential consolidation or downturn. Expert Analysis on Institutional Adoption Pathways Owen Lau’s perspective carries weight due to his role at Clear Street, a firm specializing in modernizing capital markets infrastructure. His analysis bridges traditional finance and the digital asset ecosystem. The entry of institutional investors is not a monolithic event but a gradual process influenced by several factors beyond just interest rates. These include regulatory clarity, the development of robust custody solutions, and the availability of regulated financial products like Bitcoin ETFs. Nevertheless, monetary policy acts as the overarching tide that lifts or lowers all boats. A lower-rate environment decreases the hedging and carry costs associated with large-scale crypto investments. It also makes the narrative of digital assets as “digital gold” or an inflation hedge more compelling if traditional fiat yields are diminishing. The convergence of a friendly Fed policy with maturing market infrastructure could create a powerful synergy for the 2026 landscape. Historical precedent offers some insight. The post-2020 period of near-zero rates and quantitative easing coincided with a historic bull run in cryptocurrencies. While the market structure has evolved, the fundamental relationship between cheap money and risk-asset appreciation remains a cornerstone of financial theory. Analysts now model how this relationship will manifest in a market with deeper liquidity and more sophisticated participants. The Interplay of Macroeconomic Forces and Digital Assets Cryptocurrencies no longer trade in a vacuum, isolated from global financial currents. Today, they react to U.S. dollar strength, Treasury yield movements, and equity market sentiment. This increased correlation, especially in times of stress, highlights the asset class’s integration into the broader financial system. Therefore, the Fed’s actions in 2025 and 2026 will reverberate through multiple channels. First, the direct channel involves investment allocation as described by Lau. Second, an indirect channel exists through the impact on technology stocks and growth equities, which often move in tandem with crypto assets. A bullish environment for Nasdaq, frequently fueled by lower rates, tends to create a supportive backdrop for crypto. Third, the psychological channel of “risk-on” versus “risk-off” sentiment is powerfully influenced by central bank messaging. Other global central banks, including the European Central Bank and the Bank of England, are on similar policy trajectories. Their synchronized or divergent actions will influence global dollar liquidity—a key metric for all internationally traded assets. A globally coordinated easing cycle could unleash a tidal wave of liquidity, while a fragmented approach might lead to more complex, region-specific market dynamics. Conclusion The pace of Federal Reserve interest rate cuts stands as the definitive macroeconomic variable for the 2026 cryptocurrency market. Analyst Owen Lau’s assessment underscores a fundamental shift where traditional monetary policy directly steers capital flows into digital assets. While regulatory developments and technological innovation provide the foundation, the Fed’s decisions on the cost of capital will likely determine the scale and timing of the next major market phase. Investors and observers must therefore monitor inflation data, employment reports, and FOMC communications with heightened attention, as these indicators will collectively chart the course for crypto market performance in the coming years. FAQs Q1: Why do Federal Reserve rate cuts affect the cryptocurrency market? Rate cuts lower returns on traditional safe-haven assets like bonds, making higher-risk, higher-potential-return assets like cryptocurrencies more attractive to both retail and institutional investors seeking yield. Q2: What did the Fed say in its December 2024 FOMC meeting minutes? The Federal Reserve stated it is prepared to adjust monetary policy as appropriate if risks emerge that could impede achieving its economic goals, indicating a data-dependent but flexible approach to future rate decisions. Q3: How could institutional investment change if rates fall? Lower rates reduce the cost of capital and hedging for large institutions, making substantial allocations to volatile assets like cryptocurrency more financially viable and strategically appealing within a diversified portfolio. Q4: Is the crypto market’s reaction to rate cuts guaranteed? While historical correlation exists, the reaction is not guaranteed. Market response also depends on concurrent factors like regulatory clarity, global economic health, and asset-specific developments within the crypto ecosystem. Q5: What other economic indicators should be watched alongside Fed announcements? Key indicators include Consumer Price Index (CPI) reports for inflation, unemployment data, GDP growth figures, and broader equity market performance, as these all inform the Fed’s policy decisions and overall market sentiment.

Metaplanet Spent $451 Million On Bitcoin In Q4 2025 As revealed by Metaplanet CEO Simon Gerovich in a new X post , the Bitcoin treasury company participated in some fresh accumulation over Q4 2025. In total, the firm added 4,279 BTC at an average buying price of $105,412 during this period. The latest announcement has followed three months of no new purchases from Metaplanet. The last time that the Japanese company added more BTC was in September, with two big buys involving more than 5,000 tokens each occurring in the second half of that month. About a week or so after the second of those purchases, Bitcoin formed a high above $126,000, which has acted as the top of the bull market so far. The firm has not been making announcements since then, which may be due to the fact that the asset has witnessed a notable drawdown. Nonetheless, the new announcement suggests that Metaplanet was silently buying tokens in the background, with the company only choosing to unveil it as 2025 approaches an end. As a result of this accumulation, Metaplanet’s holdings have grown significantly. Before the Q4 2025 buying spree, the firm held 30,823 BTC. Now, that figure has risen to 35,102 BTC. The Q4 2025 treasury expansion cost the company a total of $451.06 million, but due to the decline in the cryptocurrency’s price recently, the value of the tokens is down to $376.26 million today. The new accumulation isn’t the only portion of the Bitcoin treasury that has gone underwater; the firm’s entire holdings are in fact currently in a state of loss. With a cost basis of $107,606 per token, Metaplanet’s 35,102 BTC holdings cost $3.78 billion to assemble. Today, these coins are worth just $3.08 billion. Metaplanet is currently the fourth largest corporate holder of BTC in the world, as rankings from BitcoinTreasuries.net show. Even with its Q4 2025 buying, Metaplanet is still more than 8,000 BTC behind Twenty One Capital, which holds 43,514 BTC. Thus, Simon’s company will need a couple more purchases of this size to close in the gap. In the table, it’s apparent that Strategy , the OG treasury firm, is in a different stratosphere from the rest of the names on the list, with its total Bitcoin holdings standing at 672,497 BTC right now. Unlike Metaplanet, the Michael Saylor-led company continued to make regular purchase announcements even as BTC went through its bearish shift. The latest of these came up this Monday, with the firm loading up on 1,229 BTC. BTC Price At the time of writing, Bitcoin is floating around $88,000, unchanged from one week ago.",Bitcoin News|bitcoin|Bitcoin Treasury|Bitcoin Treasury Metaplanet|btc|BTCUSDT|Metaplanet,EN,0,0,BTC|REGULATION|DIGITAL ASSET TREASURY|MACROECONOMICS|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-12-31 01:00:20

Repeated attempts to reclaim higher levels have stalled, reinforcing growing skepticism among analysts who now openly discuss the risk of a broader bear market extending into 2026. Sentiment remains fragile, dominated by caution and reduced risk appetite, as traders wait for clearer confirmation of the next directional move.

Some investors argue that Bitcoin is entering a transitional phase rather than a full trend reversal. According to on-chain analyst Axel Adler, the current setup in Bitcoin’s “Supply in Profit” metric offers important context. Adler highlights that Supply in Profit has fallen sharply from October peaks above 19 million BTC to roughly 13.5 million BTC following the correction from all-time highs. This decline pushed the short-term 30-day moving average well below the 90-day average, creating a gap of around 1.75 million BTC. While a similar configuration appeared in 2022 before an extended bearish period, Adler notes a key difference this time: the 365-day moving average remains historically elevated. Importantly, the 30-day average appears to have formed a local bottom in mid-December and is beginning to stabilize. Adler argues that if Bitcoin can hold current price levels or higher, this stabilization could mark the early groundwork for a renewed bullish phase later in 2026. Supply in Profit Signals a Critical Inflection Window Axel Adler also shared a forward-looking forecast chart tracking the convergence between the 30-day and 90-day moving averages of Bitcoin’s Supply in Profit metric, offering a potential roadmap for the next structural shift. The model extrapolates current rates of change to estimate when a bullish configuration—defined by SMA 30 crossing above SMA 90—could emerge. According to Adler’s analysis, the gap between these two moving averages is currently narrowing at a pace of roughly 28,000 BTC per day. Importantly, this convergence is not being driven by a sharp recovery in Supply in Profit, but by a mechanical decline in the SMA 90. As peak October values, when Supply in Profit reached 19–20 million BTC, roll out of the 90-day calculation window, downward pressure on the longer average creates a temporary “tailwind” for convergence. This effect is expected to persist through late January. If current conditions hold, Adler projects a potential bullish cross forming between late February and early March. However, the forecast remains highly price-sensitive. Supply elasticity to price is estimated at 1.3x, meaning a 10% price decline could trigger a 13% drop in Supply in Profit. The $70,000 level is critical according to the forecast. Below it, SMA 30 would likely fall faster than SMA 90, invalidating the convergence thesis and reopening a 2022-style prolonged recovery scenario.

The chart shows BTC consolidating after a sharp breakdown from the $100,000–$105,000 region, a move that decisively flipped prior support into resistance. This rejection marked a clear loss of bullish control and initiated a deeper corrective phase. Price now compresses below the downward-sloping 50-day and 100-day moving averages.. This configuration reinforces the prevailing bearish trend and suggests that upside attempts are likely to face supply pressure. The 200-day moving average, currently well above spot price, highlights how far BTC has drifted from its longer-term trend equilibrium. Related Reading: Why $100,000 Is Bitcoin’s Most Important Resistance Level Momentum has cooled notably since the November sell-off. While selling intensity has eased, the absence of strong bullish volume indicates that buyers remain cautious. The recent price action resembles a consolidation range rather than a reversal, with BTC oscillating between roughly $85,000 and $90,000. This behavior often reflects indecision rather than accumulation. For now, $90,000 remains the critical level bulls must reclaim to shift sentiment meaningfully. Failure to do so keeps downside risks in play, with $85,000 acting as near-term support. Until price regains key moving averages, the broader structure favors continued range-bound or corrective price action.
