The DEX officials have not yet issued a formal announcement to explain the origin of the delay and when they intend to fix the outage. Growing concerns among traders reveal that withdrawals on the Lighter exchange are failing. According to reports from the exchange’s users, withdrawal requests are prompting an error message stating “Too many L2 Withdrawals.” The error message hints that the Layer-2 withdrawal queue may be overcrowded or unable to keep up with user requests due to the Prover’s lag. A lag between Lighter’s Prover and its Sequencer is credited for the withdrawal delays Expect Panic at the Disco until Lighter actually communicates in Discord — zk baby. Withdrawals will pile up, transaction fails common, reversions and not a single post from team, just the Lighter candle holders. Can we get a Gauntlet thinkpiece on withdrawal ADLs? pic.twitter.com/0zK9strL4j — Mister Todd (@pondermint) December 30, 2025 The disruption is allegedly caused by a processing lag between the exchange’s Prover and its Sequencer, causing significant delays when finalizing withdrawals. On-chain data from Lighter’s explorer shows that the last committed block (Block #137759880) was finalized approximately 9 hours prior to the time of this publication. One of the most recent visible blocks recorded only one transaction and a single withdrawal log, showcasing a significant slowdown in withdrawal processing on the trading platform. Lighter has not issued a formal statement to address the cause of the withdrawal disruptions or when the issue will be sorted. The lack of communication has left users wondering whether the protocol is queuing withdrawals or temporarily restricting orders at the protocol level. Disruptions facing withdrawal transactions on Layer 2 platforms often spark a wave of concern among users due to their reliance on sequencers and provers when transferring funds back to Layer 1. Lighter users now depend on error messages and on-chain data to monitor the status of their funds. The disruptions emerged as Lighter rolled out its native Lighter Infrastructure Token (LIT) on Tuesday. A previous report by Cryptopolitan detailed that the token would start trading on Lighter’s platforms before spreading to other exchanges. The Lighter team announced the structure of the token, highlighting its key use cases as part of a growing ecosystem. The token launch included an airdrop campaign to early adopters worth 25% of the token’s fully diluted value. Lighter stated that a portion of the revenue generated from the project’s decentralized exchange will be allocated for token buybacks and growth-oriented use cases, contingent upon prevailing market conditions. The token buyback program is part of the developers’ strategy to create long-term value for the protocol’s community members. According to data from CoinMarketCap, a cryptocurrency data aggregator, Lighter’s LIT is currently trading at $2.84, with a market capitalization of $710 million and a 24-hour trading volume of $8.3 million. The crypto asset is up 5.72% and has hit a high of $4.04 since its launch. Data from Coingecko shows that Lighter has registered open interests worth $1.4 billion in the last 24 hours and reached a trading volume of $3.6 billion in the last day. DEX perpetual futures trading is gaining popularity among traders Perpetual futures trading on decentralized exchanges has experienced explosive growth in 2025 on platforms such as Hyperliquid, Lighter, and Aster. Cryptopolitan previously reported that derivatives trading on DEXs surged in 2025 as traders sought ways to amplify their exposure with limited capital. The report highlighted that perpetual futures monthly trades have exceeded $1 trillion, with Hyperliquid leading the pack. Hyperliquid recently announced it had onboarded more than 600,000 new users in 2025 and achieved $844 million in revenue. Cryptopolitan reported that the DEX drew a total of $3.87 billion in inflows and a total trading volume of $2.95 trillion, spanning 198.9 billion transactions since January this year. During the year, the decentralized exchange averaged about $8.34 billion per day, with spot trading volume on the exchange exceeding $116 billion. HIP-3 trading activities also surged, reaching $11 billion. Bitcoin was the most actively traded cryptocurrency on the platform, achieving a trading volume of $1.16 trillion.

On-chain data shows that validator deposits have once again outpaced exits, even after months of higher withdrawal activity, reflecting improved sentiment among holders. Notably, the change is being closely watched as a potential catalyst that could tighten supply and support a move towards or above the $4,000 level. Ethereum Staking Deposits Overtake Withdrawals Ethereum is seeing a notable shift in staking activity as validator deposits have surpassed withdrawals for the first time in six months. Validator entry queues have surged to more than twice the size of exit queues, pointing to renewed demand for staking and growing confidence among institutional partners and ETH long-term holders . Data from ValidatorQueue shows that Ethereum’s validator entry queue has climbed to roughly 788,310 ETH, at the time of writing. At current prices, this represents about $2.3 billion in value and comes with an estimated wait time of 13 days and 16 hours to activate new validators. By contrast, ETH’s validator exit queue remains significantly smaller, standing at around 312,091, valued at approximately $916,923, as of writing. Notably, the current level represents the highest ETH volume queued for staking since late November. A surge in staking inflows above withdrawals has also been frequently associated with bullish price action for Ethereum. Meanwhile, treasury buyers have played a significant role in this increase in validator entry queues, with Ethereum-focused firm Bitmine leading the way. Data from LookOnChain reveals that the crypto company staked 342,560 ETH on December 28, valued at roughly $1 billion. Bitmine’s staking activity comes as it prepares to launch its Made in America Validator Network (MAVAN) in 2026. Such large-scale staking by treasury firms typically reduces ETH’s liquid supply, which, in turn, can support higher prices. Beyond treasury companies, Ethereum’s broader network participation is also rising. ValidatorQueue reports that there are now more than 983,060 active validators on the blockchain, representing approximately 29.29% of the total supply, or around 35.5 million ETH, currently staked. Moreover, the Ethereum Pectra upgrade has improved users’ staking experience and raised maximum validator limits, making restating easier for large balances. How This Could Push ETH Price Past $4,000 Historically, periods when the Ethereum validator entry queue exceeds the exit queue have often preceded major ETH price rallies. Analysts note that the last time staking deposits surpassed withdrawals, in June 2025, Ethereum’s price had doubled over a short span. If history repeats itself, the cryptocurrency could experience another sharp rally in 2026 . From its current price of above $2,930, a continuation of trends could push it well above $4,000. Analysts also confirm that ETH is currently testing the $3,000 level, and a strong bounce from this zone could open the path toward $4,000.",Ethereum|ETH|ETH news|ETH Price|ethereum news|ethereum price|ethusd|ETHUSDT,EN,0,0,ETH|TRADING|DIGITAL ASSET TREASURY|MACROECONOMICS|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-12-30 22:00:50

Over the past year, the network generated more than $1.5 billion in revenue, exceeding Ethereum and Hyperliquid combined. This outcome reinforced Solana’s scale-driven economic model at a time when fee pressure challenged rival networks. Besides revenue growth, the performance strengthened confidence in Solana’s long-term throughput strategy and market positioning heading into 2026. Solana Revenue Surge Redefines Network Economics Data from Blockworks Research showed Solana leading all blockchains in annual revenue during 2025. Hyperliquid followed with $780 million, while Ethereum posted $690 million for the same period. Consequently, Solana outperformed both networks despite maintaining some of the lowest transaction fees in the market. ​​Solana co-founder Anatoly Yakovenko celebrated the results on X, citing capacity expansion and cost efficiency. He emphasized that scale, not high fees, drove sustainable revenue growth. Significantly, Solana achieved this outcome while keeping median transaction fees below one cent. This structure allowed massive volume growth, which translated into higher aggregate revenue. Additionally, other blockchains trailing Solana included Tron, BNB Chain, Bitcoin, Base, Arbitrum, Optimism, and Avalanche. Price Action and Market Position Entering 2026 Source: CoinCodex Solana’s market price reflected modest stability alongside its recent revenue milestone. SOL traded at $123.89, showing limited movement over the past week with a 0.30% decline. Despite muted price action, trading activity remained firm, with 24-hour volume at $6.46 billion, indicating sustained liquidity. With roughly 560 million SOL in circulation, Solana’s market capitalization stood near $69.74 billion. However, December delivered choppy price action, leaving sentiment mixed. According to Onur, Solana enters 2026 at a technical crossroads where direction remains uncertain. Hence, traders now balance strong fundamentals against cautious short-term signals. Technical Levels, ETFs, and Derivatives Signals Historical data showed Solana often rebounded in January after weak December closes. In 2023, the token surged 140% following year-end selling pressure. Even in 2025, SOL recovered with a 22% January gain after a red December. Additionally, ETF flows offered support, as Solana-linked products avoided weekly net outflows since launch. Total inflows recently exceeded $755 million, indicating selective institutional interest. However, derivatives markets sent mixed signals. Futures positioning remained net short across several venues, including Hyperliquid. Consequently, analysts watched open interest closely for signs of conviction. Onur highlighted $129 as a pivotal resistance level. A sustained close above could open a move toward the mid-$160 range. Conversely, a drop below $116 could confirm a bearish EMA crossover and deepen corrective pressure.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|ETH|SOL|TRADING|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-12-30 22:00:56

The proposals would amend the Criminal Code and the Criminal Procedure Code of the Russian Federation. The latest move aims to formalize liability for mining digital currency outside the legal framework introduced last year. Under the draft, illegal mining could be punishable by a fine of up to 1.5 million rubles or forced labor for up to two years. Offenses involving especially large income or committed by an organized group could carry prison terms of up to five years. Prison, Forced Labor, Heavy Fines As part of the initiative, the Criminal Code would be amended with a new Article 171.6, titled “Illegal mining of digital currency and activities of a mining infrastructure operator.” The article defines illegal mining as the extraction of digital currency by individuals or entities not included in the official state register of persons engaged in cryptocurrency mining. Liability would arise if such activity causes large-scale damage to citizens, organizations, or the state, or if it generates income of at least 3.5 million rubles. The proposed article provides for penalties, including compulsory labor for up to 480 hours or forced labor for up to two years in cases meeting these thresholds. Tougher sanctions would apply in aggravated circumstances. According to Part Two of the draft article, offenses committed by an organized group, those that result in especially large-scale damage, or those associated with especially large income of more than 13.5 million rubles, could be punishable by fines ranging from 500,000 to 2.5 million rubles or by fines equivalent to one to three years of the offender’s income. Courts could also impose up to five years of forced labor or up to five years in prison, with or without an additional fine of up to 400,000 rubles or six months’ income. The proposal comes after the legalization of cryptocurrency mining in Russia, which came into force in November 2024. On the same day, the Federal Tax Service launched special registries that required all legal entities, individual entrepreneurs, and operators of mining infrastructure involved in the mining sector to register with the authorities. According to the Federal Tax Service, more than 1,000 participants were listed in the registries as of the end of May 2025. Current rules also require all miners, including individuals, to report their mined digital currency on a monthly basis through a dedicated section of the Federal Tax Service’s website. In early December, Deputy Prime Minister Alexander Novak said the Russian government plans to introduce criminal liability in 2026 for illegal cryptocurrency mining as well as for illegal lending. Power Theft by Crypto Miners The crackdown comes amid growing concerns over the strain illegal mining places on Russia’s power infrastructure. Earlier this year, Rosseti Group, the country’s state-owned power grid operator, reported losses of more than 1.3 billion rubles in 2024 due to unauthorized “black” mining operations, particularly in the North Caucasus, Novosibirsk, and Volga regions. Some operators ran thousands of devices and illegally drew electricity on an industrial scale, which prompted over 40 criminal investigations.

Three people familiar with the process said authorities have allegedly delivered this message directly to companies seeking clearance. The rule is not written into public policy, but it is being enforced through procurement reviews tied to plant construction and expansion. China is using this gatekeeping method to force local sourcing at scale. Companies are required to submit tenders that clearly list equipment origins. If the domestic share falls below the threshold, approvals usually stop there. Officials may allow limited flexibility when supply gaps exist, especially for advanced production lines where local tools are still incomplete. One person said regulators actually want the ratio higher. “Authorities prefer if it is much higher than 50%,” the source reportedly said. “Eventually, they are aiming for the plants to use 100% domestic equipment.” Chinese authorities tighten chipmaker approvals in efforts to change supply chains inward The requirement gained speed after the United States tightened export rules in 2023. Those measures blocked sales of advanced AI chips and key semiconductor tools to China. While some foreign equipment from the U.S., Japan, South Korea, and Europe remains available, manufacturers are now choosing local suppliers even when alternatives exist. This is no longer about access. It is about compliance. Applications that fail the sourcing test are often rejected. For advanced lines, the rules ease slightly because domestic gear does not fully cover every step. Even then, firms must show clear intent to localize over time. The policy stands as one of the strongest moves yet to cut reliance on foreign technology. It also reshapes purchasing decisions across the entire chip sector. State-linked buyers are already responding. Public procurement data shows 421 orders for domestic lithography tools and components this year, valued at about 850 million yuan. That marks a sharp rise in demand for locally developed machines. To support this shift, Beijing continues to fund the sector through the Big Fund, which launched a third phase in 2024 with 344 billion yuan, equal to about $49 billion. Domestic equipment makers gain ground under pressure President Xi Jinping has framed chip independence as a “whole nation” effort. Thousands of engineers and researchers across companies and labs are involved. Earlier this month, scientists reported work on a prototype machine capable of producing cutting-edge chips, an outcome Washington has tried to block for years. A former employee at Naura Technology allegedly said that fabs once favored U.S. tools. “Before, domestic fabs like SMIC would prefer U.S. equipment and would not really give Chinese firms a chance,” the person said. “But that changed starting with the 2023 U.S export restrictions, when Chinese fabs had no choice but to work with domestic suppliers.” The policy is already reshaping results. In etching, a key step that removes material from silicon wafers, Naura is testing tools on a 7nm production line at SMIC, after earlier success at 14nm. One source said the mandate sped up progress. “Naura’s etching results have been accelerated by the government requiring fabs to use at least 50% domestic equipment,” the person allegedly said. Foreign suppliers like Lam Research and Tokyo Electron once dominated this segment. Now they are being partially replaced by Naura and Advanced Micro-Fabrication Equipment. Naura also supplies memory chipmakers with etching tools for chips exceeding 300 layers and developed electrostatic chucks to replace parts that Lam could no longer service after 2023. Naura filed 779 patents in 2025, more than double its filings in 2020 and 2021, while AMEC filed 259. And Naura’s first-half 2025 sales rose 30% to 16 billion yuan, while AMEC reported a 44% jump to 5 billion yuan, according to Reuters.

Allegedly, the last tranche may have even been closer to $22.5 billion, but either way, it’s done. The Japanese conglomerate now holds over 10% ownership in the Sam Altman-led AI powerhouse because apparently, a few billion here and there just wasn’t enough, and the final payment was transferred last week, with a deal that’s been in the works since early 2024. SoftBank had initially invested $8 billion directly into the ChatGPT creator, then brought in a crew of co-investors to syndicate another $10 billion. OpenAI is preparing for IPO and massive infrastructure plans The SoftBank-OpenAI deal was originally priced at a $260 billion pre-money valuation, and SoftBank was expected to drip out the funds across 12 to 24 months, with some of the capital earmarked for OpenAI’s wild Stargate venture with Oracle and the White House, among others. Just a few weeks ago, SoftBank dumped its entire $5.8 billion stake in Nvidia . People close to the matter have allegedly said the Nvidia sale, plus other liquidity moves, were aimed at fueling the OpenAI mega-deal. And now that it’s finalized, there’s no ambiguity about where that money went. Over the next few years, OpenAI is planning to throw more than $1.4 trillion into infrastructure. That’s trillion with a T. The spending spree includes deep collaborations with Nvidia (again), AMD, and Broadcom. Everyone’s cashing in on the AI boom—and SoftBank wants a front-row seat. The startup isn’t just collecting checks from Tokyo, either. Microsoft has been backing it for years. Amazon is reportedly exploring a $10 billion investment, and even Disney slid in recently with a $1 billion deal, letting Sora, OpenAI’s video generator, use its roster of characters.

The move not only strengthens BitMine’s position as a major validator but also shows the company’s deep institutional commitment to Ethereum’s long-term value proposition, particularly as it continues to expand its total ETH holdings, which now reportedly exceed 4.1 million ETH. Additionally, BitMine is actively developing its “Made in America Validator Network (MAVAN),” slated for launch in the first quarter of 2026, indicating a major infrastructure play alongside its substantial asset accumulation. California’s Crypto Tax Quake: Unrealized Gains Proposal Sparks Exodus Fears The “ 2026 Billionaire Tax Act ” is also driving capital flight fears. The proposal seeks a 5% annual tax on net wealth above $1 billion, explicitly targeting unrealized gains in crypto assets. Critics like Kraken co-founder Jesse Powell argue that this forces founders to liquidate positions to pay taxes on paper profits, potentially triggering structural selling pressure if passed. The implications of such a tax extend beyond just billionaires, potentially setting a precedent that could ripple through the entire U.S. crypto industry. The difficulty in accurately valuing often volatile crypto assets for annual tax purposes, especially those with limited liquidity, presents a major practical and administrative challenge. Should this bill gain traction, the “pre-emptive exodus” of crypto-native capital from Silicon Valley to more tax-friendly jurisdictions like the UAE or Florida could rapidly accelerate before the 2026 tax year begins, potentially altering the development of the sector and investment within the state.

Key momentum indicators suggest selling pressure is fading, while long-term holders appear to be quietly absorbing supply. Although price action remains cautious for now, the setup is sparking discussions about whether XRP is positioning itself for another major move once market confidence returns. A Rare Momentum Reset On The Higher Timeframe In a significant technical development on XRP’s high-timeframe charts, Steph is Crypto has highlighted that the Stochastic RSI on the 3-week interval has plummeted to a value of 0.00. This level represents a state of total compression for the oscillator, signaling a momentum shift that is rare in the asset’s trading history. Related Reading: XRP Price Trims Upside, Slow Decline Signals Seller Dominance The rarity of this signal cannot be overstated, as it has occurred only once before at the absolute depths of the 2022 bear market. Historically, when the indicator reaches zero, it serves as a definitive marker that the prevailing selling pressure has reached a point of total exhaustion. From a structural perspective, it indicates that the energy behind the downward trend has completely dried up. It is important to note that this does not guarantee an immediate recovery. When this technical phenomenon surfaced in previous cycles, it preceded a prolonged accumulation phase. During that period, the price stabilized as smart money began to build positions, creating a foundation for the next major impulsive move toward the upside. Seeing this signal reappear now suggests that XRP’s downside risk is structurally limited at current valuations. It points to a market environment where long-term holders are actively absorbing the available supply, transitioning from a distribution phase to a period of strategic positioning. A Familiar Market Rhythm Is Emerging on XRP’s Long-Term Chart Altcoin Pioneers, in a recent update, highlighted a striking fractal pattern forming on XRP’s chart, suggesting that history may be repeating with remarkable accuracy. A 3-day chart comparison reveals strong similarities between the 2016–2017 market cycle and the current structure, both shaped by a prolonged ABC corrective phase before a major breakout. Related Reading: XRP Exchange Inflows Spike To End 2025: Will Price Decline Deepen? In the earlier cycle, XRP spent months completing its correction before launching into an explosive rally. The 2024 structure mirrors the past ABC pattern, while the ongoing 2025–2026 correction is aligning closely with the final C-wave down to the $1.87 region, though on a slightly shorter timeline. If this fractal continues to play out, Altcoin Pioneers believe XRP could be nearing the end of a painful shakeout phase, setting the stage for the next powerful upside leg. XRP has followed this script before, and those who held through the last cycle understand what’s coming next.

56617683,649540,1767135636,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/56617683.jpeg,Here’s The XRP Fractal That Says Price Is Headed To $27,https://bitcoinist.com/fractal-says-xrp-is-headed-to-27/,"A technical analysis shared by EGRAG CRYPTO outlines a specific fractal structure that he believes is still guiding XRP’s broader price behavior. The model does not frame the move as inevitable, and it leaves room for uncertainty . Instead, it outlines a conditional roadmap based on how XRP continues to move within a white fractal that the analyst says is tracking with roughly 82% accuracy and, if maintained, points to a possible advance to as high as $27. What The White Fractal Is Showing Right Now The focus of the analysis is what EGRAG refers to as the White Fractal, which is the most realistic version of the different fractals he is currently tracking. Unlike earlier fractal iterations, this one is treated as an evolving structure that must continue to align with price action to keep being valid. According to the analyst, the current setup is about 82% aligned with XRP’s price action this year, based on similarities in accumulation behavior, breakout formation, and interaction with exponential moving averages. EGRAG was careful to note that this version has not yet earned a full upgrade to his higher-confidence blue or green fractals, keeping expectations grounded in what the structure is actually delivering so far. How The Fractal Projects XRP Price Targets The prediction for XRP’s price outlook is a sequence of price zones, each tied to a declining probability as price action moves higher. According to the projection, the most statistically favored outcome is around the $3.20 level, which EGRAG assigns a 75% probability if the fractal structure continues to play out. From there, the roadmap allows for a continuation to $8, although the probability drops to about 65% due to the additional momentum and participation required for XRP to sustain that move. After $8, the fractal begins to enter more speculative price territories. The next price target zone is around $15 to $16, and EGRAG places the probability here at around 55%. The final and most ambitious zone sits between $20 and $27, which he assigns a 50% probability. This upper range represents the peak end of the fractal projection and corresponds with the final expansion phase shown in the chart above. EGRAG estimates that, if the structure is valid, the expansion phase would most likely unfold between June 2026 and October 2026. However, he was careful to note that these projections are not guarantees. A sustained break below $1.60 would reduce the probability of XRP’s price action following projections by the fractal. A deeper move below $1.30 would mean that XRP’s current cycle has diverged too far from the fractal being referenced, which invalidates the model entirely.",XRP|Egrag Crypto|ripple|White Fractal|XRP news|XRP price|XRPUSD|XRPUSDT,EN,0,0,MARKET|TRADING|XRP|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-12-30 23:00:36

That would make it the best performance in five years for the group, second only to tech. Companies from Nucor to Sherwin-Williams, and packaging giants like Smurfit WestRock and Ball Corp., are in the spotlight. The rise is tied directly to trade protections and a sharp shift in consumer goods demand. Metals and packaging stocks will lead the charge, both forecast to post over 30% profit growth. Steel prices are up, and companies selling boxes and cans are seeing more orders as food brands push volume using discounts. Steelmakers prepare for backlog boost as tariffs drive prices Richard Bourke from Bloomberg Intelligence said tariffs on imported steel are giving U.S. producers more control over pricing. “U.S. mills should continue to displace imports as long as 50% Section 232 tariffs remain in place,” he wrote. These are the same Trump-era levies still shaping trade today. Nucor, which Bourke called the U.S. mill with the widest product range and some extra capacity, reported a strong order book for 2026. It pointed to projects in energy, infrastructure, data centers, and manufacturing as key drivers. In a December update, the company said existing policy should lead to “continued gradual improvement in business conditions.” Steel Dynamics also flagged a larger backlog. The company expects lower interest rates to help push up infrastructure spending and bring more production back to the U.S. Bourke explained that many of the orders in play are lag contracts, meaning the money won’t show up until next year. The packaging sector isn’t having the same smooth ride. Tariffs here are more of a burden, but some companies are getting help from their clients. General Mills and PepsiCo have been promoting products more aggressively, which means higher volume. Truist’s Michael Roxland said this trend has boosted Amcor and similar suppliers. Jefferies analysts believe easier year-over-year comparisons and a slow return of consumer confidence could help the sector in the second half of the year. But right now, it’s tight. RBC’s Matthew McKellar said mills in North America are already near full capacity, which could support a price hike. Packaging, chemicals, and construction firms shift strategy for growth Packaging companies are reacting with internal changes. Amcor CEO Peter Konieczny said the company plans to meet its 2026 targets using synergies, not economic improvement. The company sees adjusted profit growth of 12% to 17%, its best in five years. Still, the overall picture in packaging is messy. Growth from food producers hasn’t extended to other customers, so firms are turning to cost cuts and plant closures to manage softer demand and economic drag. International Paper, which had four years of declining profits, now expects a turnaround. But the company isn’t upbeat. Executives told an industry event in December that demand is still weak. They blamed inflation, trade pressure, and the sluggish housing market. “In North America, we still feel very tight from a supply-demand perspective,” said CFO Lance Loeffler. “All we need is a little bit of spark on the demand side, and I think it would be really good for business.” Outside packaging and metals, the remaining materials sub-sectors are hoping for a rate-cut lifeline. Chemicals are forecast to finally grow after three rough years. The same goes for construction materials, which dropped in 2025 but are set to rebound. Sherwin-Williams is ready to benefit if home sales pick up, said Citigroup’s Patrick Cunningham. Albemarle is also expected to gain ground thanks to higher lithium prices from rising demand in energy storage. For construction stocks, like CRH, falling interest rates could lower borrowing costs and push more projects forward. BI analyst Sonia Baldeira said this could help unlock residential and commercial construction deals stuck in limbo. Every piece of this puzzle points to a rare winning streak for the materials sector, one fueled by tariffs, backlogs, tighter supply, and cost cuts.

Cypherpunk Now Holds Nearly 2%,https://cryptonews.com/news/zcash-cypherpunk-corporate-treasury-play-bitcoin/,"Cypherpunk Technologies has deepened its bet on Zcash, adding fuel to a growing debate over whether privacy-focused cryptocurrencies can play a role similar to Bitcoin in corporate treasuries. The Nasdaq-listed company said it purchased an additional 56,418.09 ZEC for about $29 million at an average price of $514.02 per token. With the latest transaction, Cypherpunk now holds 290,062.67 ZEC, equal to roughly 1.76% of Zcash’s circulating supply. The company said its total position was accumulated at a blended average price of $334.41 per ZEC. Cypherpunk Sets Its Sights on 5% of the Zcash Network Chief investment officer Will McEvoy said the company is working toward a long-term goal of holding 5% of the Zcash network. He framed the strategy around the growing relevance of financial privacy while also pointing to plans to expand into other privacy-focused technologies. The move comes after a sharp corporate pivot, as the firm was formerly known as Leap Therapeutics before rebranding in November as Cypherpunk Technologies and has now repositioned itself as a Zcash-focused digital asset company. Its stock has been increasing almost 170% since the rebrand, up to approximately $1.18 compared to approximately $0.44, as per Google Finance. Source: Google Finance Zcash, in its turn, has been registering among the most robust performances in the crypto market this year. The token has increased over 800% in the last 12 months and currently trades at roughly $530, based on CoinGecko. Source: CoinGecko Bitcoin, by comparison, is down by approximately 5% over the same period, though ZEC was up almost 27% in the past 7 days alone. Notably, Zcash daily trade volume dropped by approximately half to approximately 499 million dollars in the last 24 hours, showing that activity slowed following the recent explosion. As Bitcoin Dominates Treasuries, Zcash Offers a Privacy Alternative Zcash is a fork of Bitcoin, which was released in 2016 and has many structural features in common with BTC, such as a limit of 21 million coins and a proof-of-work blockchain. The difference lies in the privacy, in which Zcash employs zero-knowledge, known as zk-SNARKs , proofs that users can use to conceal the transaction information like sender, recipient, and value, yet still provide optional transparency and auditability by using viewing keys. Those features have shaped how ZEC is being discussed as a treasury asset. Bitcoin’s appeal to corporations has rested on verifiable scarcity, deep liquidity, and growing regulatory clarity, reinforced by the approval of U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs earlier this year. Companies holding BTC typically treat it as a long-term store of value or macro hedge, with potential returns tied to price appreciation rather than operating income. Zcash, by comparison, is often described by companies adopting it as a hedge centered on privacy. Cypherpunk and a small number of other firms, including Reliance Global Group, have cited the need to protect sensitive financial activity as a reason to hold ZEC. Like Bitcoin, Zcash does not generate cash flow, and any treasury “revenue” would come from unrealized or realized gains if prices rise. Market participants are divided on near-term price direction, with Former BitMEX CEO Arthur Hayes saying ZEC could be setting up for a move toward $1,000, pointing to potential liquidity shifts that may favor privacy-focused assets. The tears of the bears shall be my sustenance. $ZEC first stop $1k pic.twitter.com/FPCZbNxMTj — Arthur Hayes (@CryptoHayes) December 29, 2025 However, others are more cautious, as analyst Eric Van Tassel has warned a pullback toward $400 is possible, while macro investor Raoul Pal recently described Zcash’s rally as looking more like capital rotation than a confirmed long-term trend. Even after its recent surge, Zcash remains more than 80% below its all-time high of $3,191.93. The post Is Zcash the Next Corporate Treasury Play?

Top altcoins like Ethereum (ETH) and XRP (XRP) have swung to negative territory on a year-to-date (YTD) basis, while BNB (BNB) has managed to deliver 21% during this period. Where could these three coins be heading at the beginning of 2026? Gemini, Google’s powerful AI model, shared with us its predictions for these altcoins. #1 – Gemini Prediction for XRP (XRP) XRP (XRP) consolidated this year following a strong spike in late 2024. Its legal victory in a long-standing case against the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), along with robust ecosystem growth initiatives, has influenced its price action in 2025. According to Gemini, the key support to watch to prevent a big decline to $1.20 would be the $1.75 area. Meanwhile, its most relevant resistance sits at $2.36. This is where the 200-day exponential moving average (EMA) sits for the token. A move above this mark would confirm a bullish outlook for XRP. Gemini predicts the following for the first quarter of 2026: “ The sharp drops seem to have halted, suggesting a potential bottoming process in early 2026. ” #2 – Gemini Prediction for Ethereum (ETH) Ethereum’s performance this year was mostly influenced by the successful implementation of the Pectra upgrade back in April. This technical overhaul propelled the price to a new all-time high just a few months later. Gemini indicates that the key support to watch at the time is the $2,800 area. A break below this mark could result in a drop to $2,400 in the near term. Meanwhile, the $3,370 area seems to be the key resistance that the price must overcome to rally back to the $4,000 zone. Its baseline prediction for Ethereum for the beginning of 2026 is consolidation. Gemini concluded the following based on its analysis of the latest price action: “ETH is likely to trade sideways in early 2026 as it builds a base. ” #3 – Gemini Prediction for BNB Coin (BNB) BNB Coin (BNB) has been this year’s top-performing token in the top 5. The growing popularity of decentralized protocols like Aster and Pancake Swap has contributed to increasing the network’s transaction volumes. The token reached a new all-time high recently at $1,360. Gemini sees the $800 level as the key support to watch if the price pulls back in the first few weeks of 2026. Meanwhile, BNB needs to rise past the $1,000 psychological barrier to rally back to the highs seen in October. Gemini sees this upcoming first quarter of 2026 as a “decision point” for the market. The AI model concluded the following regarding BNB’s outlook: “ Early 2026 will likely see a decisive move away from the $850 pivot. Given the flat RSI (47), a bounce is slightly more probable than a crash if the general crypto market stabilizes. ” Gemini Thinks The Market Has Bottomed Already After an assessment of the price action of these top three altcoins, Gemini shared this interesting take about the state of the crypto market: “The charts suggest that the crypto market is in a late-stage correction or early accumulation phase . The explosive growth of mid-2025 has faded, and early 2026 will likely be defined by capital preservation and range-bound trading.” As the market as a whole consolidates, seizing the most attractive opportunities in certain categories like meme coins could make a big difference. Top crypto presales like Maxi Doge ($MAXI) are potential hidden gems that could deliver interesting gains as a new year begins. Maxi Doge ($MAXI) Raises Over $4M to Bring Meme’s Hype to the Trading Space Maxi Doge ($MAXI) is an Ethereum meme coin inspired by the popular Doge meme.

XMR/USDT price chart: TradingView Monero price analysis gives a bullish prediction regarding the ongoing market trends, as the coin’s price is increasing after price crashed from the $480 mark. If sellers hold the ongoing momentum, XMR’s estimated price might decrease to the $420 range. However, if the bulls continue to hold the $430 level, the price can then be expected to rise to $460 again. Is Monero a good investment? Monero is an attractive investment because it emphasizes privacy and security, utilizing advanced cryptographic techniques to ensure transaction confidentiality, which has created a strong demand in the market . Its growing adoption across various use cases and a decentralized development model enhance its long-term potential. With a limited supply and increasing investor interest, Monero offers a unique opportunity for those seeking financial autonomy and privacy to invest in cryptocurrency. However, investors should remain cautious of regulatory risks and market volatility when considering Monero as part of their portfolio, making it essential to seek investment advice. Why is XMR down? Monero price analysis shows that XMR saw a sharp drop after being rejected at the $480 mark resulting in a drop to the current $435 level. Will XMR recover to its all-time high? Monero is expected to recover toward its all-time high of $518 by mid-2026 as the privacy chain continues to reduce its tech debt and progresses toward greater utility and privacy. However, the platform might have to overcome regulatory scrutiny and challenges before it can see mass adoption, as it remains highly speculative . How much will Monero be worth in 5 years? The Monero price prediction for 2030 suggests a minimum price of $1,048.76 and an average trading price of $1,142.11 . The maximum forecasted price is set at $1,208.35. Will XMR reach $1000? The chances of Monero (XMR) hitting $1,000 hinge on various factors, which will influence its future price movements. The adoption of privacy transactions and technological advances could increase demand. Favorable regulations and market sentiment toward privacy coins would also help. Yet, regulatory risks, competition, and market volatility creating an atmosphere of extreme fear are challenges that Monero traders could face that could hinder significant growth. $1,000 is possible with favorable conditions, especially considering the current price but market dynamics and regulations will shape its path. Does XMR have a good long-term future? Monero (XMR) has the potential for a strong long-term future due to its focus on privacy and security, which makes it attractive to users seeking anonymity. However, many investors have concerns regarding privacy, regulatory scrutiny, and notoriety from being the favored medium for some past criminals, which impact the current Monero sentiment. Monero’s commitment to ring confidential transactions and the broader monero project gives it a solid foundation for long-term growth, but it must carefully navigate market and regulatory landscapes.

Monero historic price sentiment XMR price history Monero’s market value has changed dramatically since its launch in 2014, from less than $1 to over $475. May 2021 marked the highest point in Monero’s history. Monero’s price projections revealed the coin’s security. They provide investors with optimism that they will be freed from the persecution of some authorities simply by buying or selling Monero Across 2023, Monero’s price rose by 11.49%. The highest price was $278.56, and the lowest was $114.16. In January 2024, Monero stayed stable around the $150.00 mark as market momentum remained low. However, the stability was short-lived as February crashed to $101.95. However, XMR showed swift recovery as it closed the month near the $150.00 level again. In March and April 2024, XMR saw a steady decline from $150.00 to $120.00, where it found key support. In May 2024, XMR observed steady bullish pressure as the price rose from $120.00, approaching resistance at $150. In June 2024, Monero (XMR) traded within the $150 – $175 price range as either side struggled to make a clear breakthrough. In July, the crypto traded around the $155 mark as the price volatility remained relatively low. XMR opened trading at $156.05 in August and ended the month at $176.00, making remarkable gains. September was bearish for the asset, as the price declined below the $160 mark by the end of the month. In October, Monero observed a steep crash and has been making a swift recovery since then. In December, Monero made remarkable strides as the asset’s price broke past the $220 mark, albeit briefly as it closed the month below $200. In January, Monero saw a bullish January as the price rose from below the $200 mark to $238 by the end of the month. In February, the price fell towards the $215 mark as bears dominate the markets. In March, the price observes mixed momentum and closed the month slightly below $215. In April the consolidation continued until late into the month when it spiked past the $325 mark before ending the month around $275. In May the price continued rising rapidly as the bulls cruised past $300 ending the month around $320. During June the price continued to observe high volatility but observed low net change as the asset closed the month around $313. In July the price saw a huge spike in volatility as the price rose past $340 but the asset closed the month below the $310 mark. In August the price declined rapidly falling to the $260 mark by the month’s end. In September, the price rose to the $340 and while it did not maintain the level but managed to close the month above the $320 mark. In October the price continued to rise ending the month above the $340 mark, a trend separating it from most other cryptocurrencies that saw a decline during the period. In November, the bullish rally continued with XMR crossing the $400 mark by the end of the month.",Crypto Price Predictions,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|BUSINESS|MARKET|TRADING|XMR|FORKS|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-12-30 23:30:00

Hur Jae-hong, chairman and CEO of L&F, watched his listed holdings fall from $800 million to $134 million, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index. The contract, once hailed as game-changing, has officially been downgraded to almost nothing. Tesla’s Cybertruck delays and weak customer demand choked the order before it could deliver. Tesla’s Cybertruck delay kills a key EV battery deal L&F builds high-nickel cathodes for electric vehicle batteries. These were supposed to go straight to Tesla for the Cybertruck. But that model ran into constant delays, and buyers just didn’t bite. No one’s seen much of the angular truck, and L&F’s order quietly died behind the scenes. The company confirmed this week that the massive order is now worth less than $10,000. The stock market didn’t wait for the news. L&F shares have been dropping since their 2023 peak, when the Tesla contract was first announced. They’ve now plunged more than 70%, dragged down by the collapse of the order and a general slump in EV demand worldwide. It didn’t help that L&F was leaning heavily on LG Energy Solution Ltd., its top customer, and investor confidence began to crack long before Monday’s shock filing. Still, analysts say this isn’t a full break-up between L&F and Elon Musk’s company. “L&F had probably already stopped supplying cathodes to Tesla since last year,” said Changmin Lee, an analyst at KB Securities. The materials were only meant for some Cybertruck models, and with that project stalling, the deliveries never picked up. Lee added that the recent filing “will likely be extremely limited” in terms of market impact, since the contract had already been factored out of forecasts. L&F’s long-term partnerships now under pressure Even though the Cybertruck plan crashed, L&F’s business with Tesla still supplies Model Y components indirectly through LG Energy Solution, which accounts for around 80% of its total sales. That pipeline is running without disruption for now. But the loss of the direct Tesla order smashed L&F’s diversification strategy.In 2021, the company inked a deal with Redwood Materials, the US battery recycler run by Tesla’s ex-CTO, JB Straubel. That partnership was supposed to help L&F lower its dependence on LG Energy Solution to 50% by 2025. That goal now looks shaky. There might still be a way out. Anna Lee, an analyst at Yuanta Securities Korea, said L&F is expected to begin production for Rivian in 2026, after securing a deal back in March. They’re also sending mid-nickel cathodes to SK On Co., used in Hyundai Motor’s EV batteries. That means they’ve still got irons in the fire. “A short-term damper in investor sentiment is inevitable,” said Anna. “But there is an increasing possibility that the sector will regain attention in 2026, specifically centering on energy storage systems for AI data centers.” Still, none of that changes the fact that a $2.9 billion Tesla contract just evaporated into dust, and L&F’s billionaire dreams were smashed into seven thousand bucks.

Here’s what history suggests could happen next. Bitcoin Social Volume Suggests Rise Of Greed In a new post on X, analytics firm Santiment has talked about how social media sentiment toward Bitcoin is looking right now. The indicator of relevance here is the “Social Volume,” measuring the total amount of posts/messages/threads on the major social media platforms that are making unique mentions of a given term or topic. Related Reading: Bitcoin Equilibrium: Active Market Participants Just Breaking Even For judging the degree of sentiment around BTC that’s present on social media, Santiment has filtered the indicator for both Bitcoin-related terms and sentiment-related ones. More specifically, the analytics firm has applied to the BTC Social Volume the terms “higher” and “above” to pinpoint bullish comments, and “lower” and “below” to gauge bearish sentiment. Now, here is the chart shared by Santiment that shows how the two types of Bitcoin Social Volume have changed over the last few months: As displayed in the above graph, the Bitcoin Social Volume has just seen an uptick, although not a very significant one. Bullish comments have outpaced the bearish ones in this spike, suggesting that the retail crowd is getting optimistic about where BTC will head as New Year’s approaches. If history is anything to go by, though, this optimism may not actually be a positive sign for the cryptocurrency. Generally, BTC and digital asset markets tend to move in a direction that goes contrary to the expectations of the majority. The analytics firm has noted that many short-term Bitcoin swings in the last three months have followed this pattern. From the chart, it’s visible that a spike in bearish calls has led to price bounces, while greed on social media has coincided with local tops. Considering this trend, it’s possible that the latest surge in positive social media comments surrounding Bitcoin could end up proving to be a bearish signal. Though that said, the intensity of the greedy sentiment hasn’t been too high so far. In some other news, cumulative Bitcoin returns have flattened out for all trading sessions recently, as CryptoQuant community analyst Maartunn has pointed out in an X post. The trading sessions in the chart correspond to periods when users from a specific market are likely to be active. In the first half of December, Bitcoin’s gains were dominated by the US session, but recently, returns have flatlined for all three of the US, Europe, and Asia-Pacific. Related Reading: XRP Exchange Inflows Spike To End 2025: Will Price Decline Deepen? This suggests that no trader demographic is diverging in behavior. “Market momentum is neutral across the board,” noted Maartunn.

56619445,649594,1767139232,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/56619445.jpeg,Ethereum Nearing A Turning Point? Supply-Demand Structure Suggest A Shift Is Coming In 2026,https://bitcoinist.com/ethereum-turning-point-supply-demand-structure/,"Ethereum is once again struggling to regain the $3,000 level, highlighting the fragile state of the market as selling pressure continues to weigh on price action. After multiple failed attempts to push higher, ETH remains locked below key resistance, reflecting broad uncertainty and a lack of conviction among both traders and long-term investors. Market sentiment has deteriorated sharply, with apathy and fear dominating positioning as participants remain hesitant to deploy fresh capital. Rather than aggressive capitulation, the current environment points to exhaustion and indecision, a common feature of late-cycle corrective phases. According to a recent report by XWIN Research Japan on CryptoQuant, Ethereum is now in a late-stage bearish phase that appears to be transitioning into a more range-bound structure. While bearish pressure still dominates the broader trend, the nature of selling activity is changing. Instead of sharp, panic-driven sell-offs, the market is experiencing slower, more methodical distribution, suggesting that many weak hands may have already exited. This shift often marks a critical inflection point, where volatility compresses, and price stabilizes within a defined range. The report notes that such phases typically reflect a market searching for equilibrium. Although this does not guarantee an immediate recovery, it does indicate that downside momentum may be weakening. For Ethereum, the coming weeks will be decisive in determining whether this range evolves into a base for recovery or resolves into another leg lower. Ethereum’s On-Chain Structure Improves As Price Weakness Persists While Ethereum continues to struggle below key resistance levels, on-chain indicators suggest that the underlying market structure may be gradually improving. Data shows ETH leaving exchanges at the fastest pace of this cycle, a move increasingly associated with self-custody, staking, and long-term holding rather than short-term trading activity. This shift is reinforced by validator queue dynamics: for the first time in six months, the entry queue has surpassed the exit queue, with roughly 745,000 ETH waiting to be staked versus around 360,000 ETH queued for withdrawal. The imbalance points to renewed staking participation and a tightening medium- to long-term supply profile. Additional context comes from the 90-day Spot Taker CVD, which indicates a transition away from strongly sell-dominant conditions toward neutral to mildly positive pressure. Although this does not imply an immediate price rebound, it suggests that aggressive selling is beginning to lose intensity. That said, Ethereum ETF flows remain negative on both daily and weekly timeframes, signaling that institutional demand via financial products continues to weigh on price action. Beyond market flows, Ethereum’s network activity remains resilient. Deployed smart contracts reached a record 8.7 million in Q4 2025, while on-chain real-world asset value expanded to approximately $19 billion, led by Ethereum. These trends indicate that usage-driven demand remains intact despite weak sentiment. The data support a scenario of ongoing price pressure alongside gradual structural improvement. This assessment would weaken if exchange balances rise again or sell-side flows regain dominance. Price Remains Below Key Moving Averages Ethereum continues to trade in a tight consolidation near the $2,900–$3,000 zone, reflecting persistent indecision after the sharp correction from the $4,800 cycle peak. The chart shows ETH struggling to reclaim the 50-day and 100-day moving averages, which are now acting as dynamic resistance around the $3,200–$3,600 region. Each attempt to push higher has been met with selling pressure, reinforcing the broader bearish structure that has been in place since November. From a trend perspective, price remains below the declining short-term moving average, while the 200-day moving average near the $3,500 area continues to slope downward. This configuration signals that Ethereum is still trading in a corrective phase rather than a confirmed recovery. However, downside momentum appears to be weakening. The recent series of higher lows around $2,750–$2,800 suggests that buyers are defending this range as a short-term demand zone. Volume has also compressed during the latest consolidation, a sign that aggressive selling may be losing intensity. This aligns with the broader narrative of exhaustion rather than renewed capitulation. Still, without a decisive reclaim of $3,200 and a move back above the 50-day average, any upside attempts remain vulnerable.

This strategic capital deployment, detected by blockchain analytics platform Onchain Lens on March 15, 2025, represents one of the largest single staking moves of the year and provides crucial insights into sophisticated crypto investment strategies. Bitmine ETH Staking Reaches $1.37 Billion Milestone Blockchain data reveals compelling details about Bitmine’s latest maneuver. The entity staked an additional 118,944 ETH, worth approximately $352.16 million at transaction time. Consequently, this substantial allocation elevates Bitmine’s total staked Ethereum to approximately 461,504 ETH, valued at $1.37 billion. Furthermore, a separate transaction occurred approximately one hour later. A new address, also presumably controlled by Bitmine, received 32,938 ETH worth $97.8 million from institutional crypto exchange FalconX. This dual-transaction pattern suggests coordinated capital management. The staking activity demonstrates long-term commitment to Ethereum’s network security. Simultaneously, the FalconX transfer indicates ongoing liquidity management. These movements collectively represent sophisticated treasury operations. Understanding Ethereum’s Proof-of-Stake Mechanism To appreciate Bitmine’s strategy, one must understand Ethereum’s fundamental shift. The network transitioned from proof-of-work to proof-of-stake in September 2022. This consensus mechanism requires validators to stake ETH as collateral. Validators then propose and validate new blocks. They earn rewards for maintaining network security. Currently, the annual percentage yield for staking ranges between 3-5%. Staking serves multiple purposes for institutional players: Yield Generation: Earn passive income on idle crypto assets Network Participation: Contribute to blockchain security and governance Long-term Positioning: Signal confidence in Ethereum’s ecosystem growth Capital Efficiency: Utilize assets that would otherwise remain dormant Institutional Crypto Investment Trends Accelerate Bitmine’s massive staking operation reflects broader institutional trends. Major financial entities increasingly allocate capital to blockchain networks. They recognize staking as a legitimate yield-generating strategy. According to blockchain analytics firm Nansen, institutional staking has grown 240% since 2023. Traditional finance now views crypto staking similarly to bond investments. The table below illustrates recent major institutional staking activities: Entity ETH Staked Approximate Value Date Bitmine (Latest) 118,944 ETH $352.16M March 2025 Coinbase Institutional 95,000 ETH $281M February 2025 Kraken Financial 67,500 ETH $200M January 2025 Fidelity Digital 82,300 ETH $244M December 2024 These substantial allocations demonstrate growing institutional comfort with blockchain technology. Moreover, they indicate maturing risk management frameworks. Financial institutions now deploy sophisticated strategies for crypto asset management. Market Impact and Network Security Implications Bitmine’s transaction carries significant market implications. Large-scale staking reduces immediately available ETH supply. This reduction can create upward price pressure during high demand periods. However, staked ETH remains locked until network upgrades enable withdrawals. The Shanghai upgrade in April 2023 introduced withdrawal capabilities. Yet, validators must follow specific unstaking procedures. From a network security perspective, Bitmine’s contribution strengthens Ethereum substantially. The entity now controls significant validation power. This concentration raises questions about decentralization. However, Ethereum’s design prevents any single validator from dominating consensus. The network distributes block proposal rights randomly among all validators. Blockchain Analytics and Transparency Advantages Onchain Lens, the analytics platform detecting this transaction, exemplifies blockchain transparency. Every transaction becomes permanently recorded on the public ledger. Analysts can trace fund movements without centralized intermediaries. This transparency creates unprecedented market intelligence opportunities. Institutional investors leverage these tools for competitive analysis. Blockchain analytics provide several advantages: Real-time Monitoring: Track capital flows as they occur Pattern Recognition: Identify institutional investment strategies Risk Assessment: Evaluate market concentration and potential vulnerabilities Regulatory Compliance: Demonstrate fund provenance and movement The FalconX transaction accompanying Bitmine’s staking reveals additional insights. FalconX serves institutional crypto clients exclusively. Their involvement suggests professional-grade execution. This detail reinforces the sophisticated nature of Bitmine’s operations. Ethereum’s Evolving Ecosystem and Future Developments Bitmine’s substantial commitment coincides with Ethereum’s ongoing evolution. The network continues implementing scalability improvements. Proto-danksharding, introduced in 2024, significantly reduced transaction costs. Further upgrades planned for 2025-2026 will enhance performance substantially. These developments make Ethereum more attractive for institutional deployment. Ethereum’s roadmap includes several key initiatives: Verkle Trees Implementation: Will enable stateless clients and improved synchronization Single Slot Finality: Will reduce block finalization time from minutes to single slots Account Abstraction Expansion: Will improve user experience and smart contract capabilities Layer 2 Integration Enhancements: Will strengthen connections with scaling solutions These technical advancements create compelling investment rationales. Institutions like Bitmine position themselves early. They capture staking rewards while supporting network development. This symbiotic relationship benefits both investors and the ecosystem. Conclusion Bitmine’s $352 million ETH staking operation represents a landmark moment for institutional cryptocurrency adoption. The transaction elevates the entity’s total staked Ethereum to $1.37 billion, demonstrating extraordinary confidence in Ethereum’s proof-of-stake consensus mechanism. This strategic capital allocation reflects sophisticated treasury management, yield generation objectives, and long-term blockchain commitment. As institutional players increasingly recognize staking’s value proposition, Ethereum’s network security strengthens correspondingly. Bitmine ETH staking activities, therefore, signal both financial strategy and ecosystem support, highlighting cryptocurrency’s maturation into a legitimate asset class for professional capital deployment. FAQs Q1: What does staking mean in cryptocurrency? Staking involves locking cryptocurrency tokens to support blockchain network operations. Participants earn rewards for validating transactions and maintaining network security, similar to earning interest in traditional finance. Q2: Why would an institution like Bitmine stake such large amounts of ETH? Institutions stake ETH to generate yield on idle assets, participate in network governance, demonstrate long-term commitment to blockchain ecosystems, and contribute to network security while positioning for future ecosystem growth. Q3: How does staking affect Ethereum’s price and availability? Staking reduces immediately available ETH supply, potentially creating upward price pressure during high demand. However, staked ETH remains part of the total supply and can eventually be withdrawn following proper network procedures. Q4: What risks do institutions face when staking large amounts of cryptocurrency? Primary risks include smart contract vulnerabilities, potential slashing penalties for validator misbehavior, liquidity constraints during lock-up periods, regulatory uncertainty, and market volatility affecting staked asset values. Q5: How does Ethereum prevent any single entity from controlling the network through massive staking? Ethereum’s proof-of-stake algorithm randomly selects validators for block proposal, preventing concentration of power.

The report covers U.S. crude oil and refined product inventories for the week ended Dec. 19, and it was scheduled for release at 10:30 a.m. Eastern time. But early that morning, the agency said the report would not be released as planned, and no new time was given. Hours later, the EIA popped back out and said the report would be published at 5 p.m., after markets had closed. The delay followed staffing reductions inside the agency after President Donald Trump ordered changes to the federal workforce. The delay came after the report had already been shifted from its normal Wednesday release to Monday because Trump signed an executive order that gave federal employees additional days off on Dec. 24 and Dec. 26. The agency said the calendar change exposed internal problems that affected how the report was produced and formatted for publication. Staff cuts disrupted systems behind the petroleum report The EIA said the publication date changed to match the holiday schedule, but the internal code used to generate the report was not updated at the same time. The agency said this mismatch slowed the creation of tables and files used to publish the report. The agency said the issue did not affect the accuracy of the data and said the problem would not happen again. The staffing reductions came from buyouts and restructuring tied to a government efficiency push that was previously associated with Elon Musk. The EIA lost more than 100 employees this year from a workforce of about 350 people. Several of those who left had worked directly on systems used to build the petroleum report. The report relies on multiple surveys and software systems, and the loss of staff reduced the number of people who understood how those systems connect. Tristan Abbey, the EIA Administrator, said the agency needs faster progress to fix its aging technology.“Without decisive acceleration, we’re going to have much bigger problems than delayed data tables,” Tristan said in a statement. He said staff are working to rebuild critical products that are written in outdated programming languages and said the work is continuing at full speed. Delays like this are rare for the petroleum report. During the recent government shutdown, the figures were still released on time. The report includes weekly data on U.S. oil inventories, which are widely followed by energy traders, refiners, and analysts. Oil prices held steady as geopolitics drove trading Despite the delay, the oil market showed little reaction. Traders focused more on global political events than on U.S. inventory levels. Scott Shelton, an energy specialist at TP ICAP Group Plc, said traders showed little concern about the missing data. “There is a general indifference to it other than rolling their eyes on how inefficient and unpredictable data has become from the US government, post the shutdown,” Scott said. Oil prices were steady on Tuesday after a volatile session. Brent crude for February delivery, which expires Tuesday, slipped 2 cents, settling at $61.92 a barrel. U.S. West Texas Intermediate crude fell 13 cents, closing at $57.95 a barrel. Both benchmarks had risen more than 2% on Monday after Saudi Arabia launched airstrikes against Yemen. Prices also moved higher after Moscow accused Kyiv of targeting a Russian presidential residence. The accusation hurt expectations for a peace deal between Russia and Ukraine. Kyiv rejected the claim, saying it was baseless and aimed at disrupting negotiations.

This critical drop, reported by sentiment analytics firm Alternative, underscores the fragile psychological state of the digital asset ecosystem. Consequently, market participants now face a complex landscape defined by high volatility and cautious capital allocation. The Crypto Fear & Greed Index Plunges into Extreme Fear Territory The Crypto Fear & Greed Index serves as a crucial barometer for market psychology. It operates on a scale from 0 to 100. A score of 0 signifies maximum fear, while 100 indicates extreme greed. The current reading of 21 represents a two-point decline from the previous measurement. This firmly places market sentiment in the “extreme fear” zone, a condition historically associated with significant price corrections and investor capitulation. The index’s methodology relies on a sophisticated, multi-factor analysis to ensure a comprehensive view. Specifically, it aggregates data from six primary sources. Market volatility and trading volume each contribute 25% to the final score. Social media sentiment and market surveys each account for 15%. Finally, Bitcoin’s dominance share of the total cryptocurrency market capitalization and relevant Google search trends each provide a 10% weighting. This composite approach helps filter out noise and identify genuine, underlying sentiment trends across different investor cohorts. Decoding the Components Behind the Sentiment Shift Several interrelated factors typically converge to drive the index into extreme fear. Firstly, increased price volatility often triggers the initial decline. Sharp, unpredictable price swings erode investor confidence and amplify uncertainty. Secondly, a noticeable drop in trading volume frequently accompanies this phase. Reduced activity suggests that both retail and institutional players are adopting a wait-and-see approach, withdrawing liquidity from the market. Furthermore, social media analysis reveals a surge in negative commentary and fear-driven narratives. Online communities shift their focus from long-term potential to immediate risks and losses. Survey data from active traders often mirrors this pessimism, reflecting a broad-based expectation of further downside. Additionally, a rising Bitcoin dominance figure can signal a “flight to safety” within crypto, where capital exits altcoins for the perceived relative stability of Bitcoin, further depressing overall sentiment. Historical Context and Comparative Analysis Historically, periods of extreme fear have presented both significant risk and potential opportunity. For instance, during the market troughs of late 2018 and early 2020, the index repeatedly touched single-digit scores. Those periods preceded major market recoveries, though timing the exact bottom proved exceptionally difficult. A comparative timeline shows these fear cycles are a recurrent, if painful, feature of the volatile crypto asset class. The table below illustrates key historical readings of the Crypto Fear & Greed Index and their market context: Index Score Sentiment Zone Approximate Period General Market Context 5-10 Extreme Fear Dec 2018 / Mar 2020 Post-bear market lows, COVID-19 crash 20-30 Fear Jun 2022 / Present Sustained bear market, macroeconomic pressure 40-60 Neutral Periods of consolidation Low volatility, balanced sentiment 70-80 Greed Q4 2020 / Q4 2021 Strong bull market advances 90+ Extreme Greed Early 2021 / Nov 2021 Market peaks, FOMO-driven buying Potential Market Impacts and Investor Considerations An extended period of extreme fear carries several practical implications. Primarily, it often correlates with depressed asset prices across the board. Many cryptocurrencies may trade significantly below their historical averages or network value metrics. This environment tests the conviction of long-term holders and can lead to forced liquidations for leveraged traders. Moreover, project development and funding can slow as market attention shifts from innovation to survival. However, seasoned analysts note that such sentiment extremes can also create conditions for future gains. Valuations become detached from euphoria and may better reflect fundamental utility. For disciplined investors, it can be a period for strategic accumulation based on rigorous research, not emotion. The key considerations during this phase include: Risk Management: Prioritizing capital preservation over aggressive speculation. Fundamental Analysis: Assessing project health beyond price action. Macro Awareness: Understanding broader financial market conditions impacting liquidity. Emotional Discipline: Avoiding decisions driven purely by fear or the desire to “catch a falling knife.” Ultimately, the Crypto Fear & Greed Index provides a snapshot, not a prophecy. It quantifies the present emotional temperature of the market, which is a powerful input for informed decision-making. Conclusion The Crypto Fear & Greed Index reading of 21 delivers a clear, data-driven message: extreme fear currently governs cryptocurrency market sentiment. This condition, stemming from volatility, reduced volume, and negative social discourse, presents a formidable challenge for all market participants. Historically, such depths of pessimism have marked cyclical lows, though recovery timelines remain uncertain. Navigating this environment demands a focus on fundamentals, rigorous risk management, and an understanding that market sentiment, while powerful, is ultimately a transient force. The index will continue to be a vital tool for gauging when the emotional tide begins to turn. FAQs Q1: What does a Crypto Fear & Greed Index score of 21 mean? A score of 21 indicates the market is in a state of “extreme fear.” This suggests widespread pessimism among investors, typically driven by falling prices, high volatility, and negative news flow. It is a quantitative measure of collective market psychology. Q2: How is the Crypto Fear & Greed Index calculated? The index is calculated using six data points: volatility (25%), market volume (25%), social media sentiment (15%), surveys (15%), Bitcoin dominance (10%), and Google search trends (10%). These are combined to produce a single number from 0 (extreme fear) to 100 (extreme greed). Q3: Is extreme fear a good time to buy cryptocurrency? Historically, periods of extreme fear have often preceded market recoveries, leading some to view them as potential buying opportunities for long-term investors. However, it does not guarantee an immediate bottom, and any investment should be based on personal research, risk tolerance, and financial goals, not sentiment alone. Q4: How often does the Crypto Fear & Greed Index update? The index is updated daily, providing a near real-time gauge of market sentiment. This allows investors and analysts to track shifts in psychology as news and price action develop. Q5: What is the difference between “fear” and “extreme fear” on the index? The index categorizes scores broadly. A reading from 0-24 signifies “Extreme Fear,” 25-49 is “Fear,” 50-74 is “Greed,” and 75-100 is “Extreme Greed.” The move from fear to extreme fear indicates a significant intensification of negative sentiment and risk aversion in the market.

With an existing stash of 510 BTC, worth $45 million, and other cash equivalents, the company’s focus has pivoted to a nutrition supplement brand, IM8. Announced on Tuesday , Prenetics’ Board has unanimously agreed that the “most promising” way to create sustainable shareholder value is to devote to a “once-in-a-generation” brand like IM8. “Operating from a position of strength, we are making disciplined strategic decisions that reflect our experience as operators and our commitment to maximizing long-term shareholder value,” said CEO Danny Yeung. Prenetics ‘1 BTC Per Day’ Strategy Stalls Prenetics started its “1 BTC per day” treasury plan on August 1, accumulating a position of about 275 BTC, worth roughly $31 million as of October 27. In October, the Nasdaq-listed firm, which counts David Beckham among its shareholders, raised $48 million in an oversubscribed equity round to purchase more Bitcoin. At the time, Prenetics’ long-term goal was to reach $1 billion in Bitcoin holdings within five years. Besides, the IM8 brand already hit $100 million in recurring revenue within its first 11 months, pivoting the company’s focus from the Bitcoin accumulation strategy. IM8 is projected to generate between $160 million and $200 million in 2026. Prenetics will retain its existing BTC holdings as a treasury reserve asset, the announcement added. “Prenetics has committed to not allocate any existing capital or new capital for the purpose of acquiring additional Bitcoin,” it read. Further, as Bitcoin entered the bear market in recent months, several digital asset treasury (DAT) companies, which once touted BTC hoarding to woo investors, have changed their focus. For instance, Peter Thiel-backed Ethereum treasury ETHZilla closed its crypto treasury , selling $74.5 million worth of ETH early this month. PRE Stock Down 3.5% in a Day Following the announcement, Prenetics (PRE) shares fell 3.5% in a day, trading around $15.74 at press time, per Yahoo Finance . However, the company’s shares have risen 189% this year, and bitcoin dipped about 5.6%. Meanwhile, Michael Saylor’s MSTR, the largest corporate Bitcoin accumulator, fell nearly 48% this year.

This substantial deposit, verified by blockchain analytics firm Onchainlens, immediately captured market attention and triggered analysis about potential implications for the Ethena (ENA) token’s price trajectory and broader market sentiment. Arthur Hayes ENA Deposit: Analyzing the Transaction Details Blockchain data reveals the Arthur Hayes ENA deposit occurred precisely five hours before initial reporting. The transaction involved moving 6.27 million ENA tokens from a private wallet to a Bybit exchange address. Market analysts immediately noted the timing coincided with ENA trading at approximately $0.204 per token. Consequently, this represents one of the most substantial single-entity ENA movements observed in recent months. Exchange deposits by prominent figures typically signal potential selling activity. However, they can also indicate preparation for other financial maneuvers. The cryptocurrency community closely monitors such movements because they often precede market volatility. Historical data shows similar transactions by major holders frequently correlate with price fluctuations within 24-72 hours. Understanding ENA Token Fundamentals and Market Context Ethena (ENA) operates as the governance token for the Ethena protocol, a synthetic dollar platform built on Ethereum. The protocol aims to create a crypto-native, yield-bearing stablecoin called USDe. Significantly, ENA holders participate in governance decisions and share protocol revenue. Since its launch, the token has demonstrated notable volatility while establishing itself within the decentralized finance ecosystem. The current market context adds layers to this analysis. Recently, the broader cryptocurrency market experienced consolidation after a significant rally. Many altcoins, including ENA, faced selling pressure. Therefore, the Arthur Hayes deposit arrives during a particularly sensitive period for token valuation. Market capitalization for ENA currently stands at approximately $290 million, making this $1.28 million transfer represent a meaningful percentage of daily trading volume. Historical Patterns of Crypto Whale Transactions Experienced market observers recognize distinct patterns in whale behavior. Typically, large exchange deposits precede selling when accompanied by specific market conditions. These conditions include declining trading volumes, negative funding rates on derivatives platforms, or weakening technical indicators. Currently, ENA shows mixed signals across these metrics. Data from previous quarters reveals that Arthur Hayes and other prominent figures often execute strategic moves during low-liquidity periods. They sometimes accumulate positions during market fear and distribute during optimism. The timing of this deposit suggests careful consideration of market microstructure. Analysts will monitor whether this transaction represents an isolated event or the beginning of a larger position adjustment. Bybit Exchange’s Role in Cryptocurrency Liquidity Bybit has emerged as a leading cryptocurrency derivatives exchange, particularly popular among professional traders. The platform offers deep liquidity for altcoins like ENA. Choosing Bybit for this deposit indicates strategic consideration of execution quality. Large sellers typically prioritize exchanges with sufficient order book depth to minimize slippage. The exchange’s reputation for sophisticated trading tools makes it attractive for complex maneuvers. Professionals often utilize Bybit’s advanced order types for large transactions. These include iceberg orders and time-weighted average price algorithms. Consequently, the Arthur Hayes ENA deposit might represent just the visible portion of a broader trading strategy. Recent exchange statistics show Bybit processing billions in daily volume. Its ENA markets maintain healthy liquidity across spot and perpetual swap products. This infrastructure supports large transactions without excessive market impact. Market makers on the exchange typically provide tight spreads for major tokens. This environment facilitates efficient execution for substantial transfers. Interpreting On-Chain Data for Market Signals Onchainlens and similar analytics platforms provide crucial transparency for cryptocurrency markets. They track wallet movements across public blockchains. These tools have become essential for market participants seeking informational edges. The identification of the Arthur Hayes wallet demonstrates improving sophistication in entity clustering techniques. Analysts combine on-chain data with other metrics for comprehensive assessment. They examine exchange inflow spikes, holder distribution changes, and network activity. For ENA, recent data shows moderate network growth but declining active addresses. This divergence creates interpretative challenges. The Arthur Hayes transaction adds another data point to this complex puzzle. Professional trading firms increasingly automate analysis of such signals. They develop algorithms that react to whale movements within minutes. Retail investors often learn about these transactions hours later. This information asymmetry highlights the evolving nature of cryptocurrency market structure. Transparency improvements continue but gaps remain between institutional and retail access. Potential Impacts on ENA Token Price and Market Sentiment Market psychology often amplifies the effects of whale transactions. The Arthur Hayes ENA deposit immediately sparked discussions across social media and trading forums. Participants debated whether this signals impending selling pressure or strategic repositioning. Historical precedent suggests several possible outcomes following such visible movements. First, immediate selling could create downward pressure if executed aggressively. Second, the deposit might represent collateral for borrowing other assets. Third, it could facilitate participation in Bybit’s earning products. Fourth, the transaction might be completely unrelated to trading intentions. Each scenario carries different implications for ENA’s price trajectory. Technical analysts note key support and resistance levels for ENA. The $0.18 level represents significant historical support. Resistance appears near $0.22 based on recent price action. The token’s current position between these levels makes it particularly sensitive to large transactions. Market depth analysis reveals relatively thin order books around current prices. This condition potentially magnifies the impact of substantial selling or buying. Regulatory and Tax Considerations for Large Transfers Major cryptocurrency transactions increasingly face regulatory scrutiny. Jurisdictions like the United States require reporting of substantial capital movements. The Arthur Hayes ENA deposit likely triggers various compliance procedures. Tax implications also factor into timing decisions for large holders. Many jurisdictions treat cryptocurrency transfers as taxable events. Professional investors typically coordinate with legal and tax advisors before executing significant moves. They consider holding period requirements for favorable tax treatment. They also evaluate reporting obligations across relevant jurisdictions. These practical considerations sometimes explain timing that appears suboptimal from purely market perspectives. The cryptocurrency industry continues evolving toward greater institutionalization with corresponding compliance complexity. Comparative Analysis with Previous High-Profile Crypto Movements The cryptocurrency market has witnessed numerous similar events involving prominent figures. For context, consider these historical precedents: Vitalik Buterin’s ETH transfers: Ethereum’s co-founder regularly moves tokens for philanthropy and project funding, typically causing minimal market disruption. MicroStrategy’s Bitcoin acquisitions: The company’s transparent accumulation strategy often boosts market confidence rather than creating selling pressure. FTX estate liquidations: Bankruptcy-mandated sales created sustained downward pressure on affected tokens throughout 2024. Coinbase insiders’ transactions: Regular SEC-filed sales by executives typically follow predetermined schedules, minimizing surprise elements. Each scenario demonstrates different market dynamics. The Arthur Hayes ENA deposit most closely resembles strategic portfolio adjustments by sophisticated investors. These moves typically consider multiple factors beyond immediate price action. They often form parts of broader asset allocation strategies across different blockchain ecosystems. Conclusion The Arthur Hayes ENA deposit of $1.28 million to Bybit represents a significant cryptocurrency market event worthy of careful analysis. This transaction highlights the ongoing importance of monitoring whale movements while maintaining perspective about their actual market impact. The ENA token now faces a critical test of its liquidity and holder conviction. Market participants should watch for follow-up transactions and exchange flow data in coming days. Ultimately, this event reinforces the cryptocurrency market’s transparency advantages while demonstrating its continued sensitivity to major holder actions. The Arthur Hayes transfer will undoubtedly influence short-term trading discussions and potentially longer-term sentiment toward the Ethena ecosystem. FAQs Q1: Why do cryptocurrency whales deposit tokens to exchanges? Whales typically transfer tokens to exchanges for several reasons: preparing to sell, using tokens as collateral for loans, participating in exchange earning programs, or moving assets between custody solutions. Exchange deposits don’t automatically mean immediate selling. Q2: How significant is a $1.28 million transfer in cryptocurrency markets? Transaction significance depends on the token’s market capitalization and daily volume. For ENA with approximately $290 million market cap, a $1.28 million transfer represents meaningful activity that could impact price, especially during low-liquidity periods. Q3: What tools do analysts use to track whale movements? Analysts utilize blockchain explorers like Etherscan, specialized analytics platforms including Nansen and Arkham Intelligence, exchange transparency reports, and social media monitoring to identify and interpret large cryptocurrency transactions. Q4: How quickly can whale transactions affect market prices? Price impact can occur within minutes if automated trading algorithms detect the movement. However, substantial selling typically requires hours or days to execute completely without excessive slippage, depending on market depth. Q5: Does Arthur Hayes frequently make large cryptocurrency transfers? As a prominent industry figure and former exchange executive, Hayes occasionally makes visible transactions. However, each movement warrants individual analysis since context and market conditions significantly influence interpretation.

The gold rush is fading, and automakers are being dragged into a brutal fight to survive. In 2025, both Tesla and BYD posted lower sales, with Tesla down 7.4% and BYD falling 5.1% from the year before. The drop got uglier in November, when BYD’s numbers collapsed by 26.5%. And while they stumbled, the flashy newcomers, including cars backed by Huawei and Xiaomi, took off with sales growth above 90%. But the old darlings aren’t the only ones sweating. Those early U.S.-listed names (Nio, Xpeng, and Li Auto) didn’t even crack the top 10 sellers, even though they’ve been improving monthly delivery numbers. It didn’t matter. This is no longer a market where every player wins just by showing up. Chinese market gets more crowded as discounts explode There’s no more room for small talk. The market is now concentrated at the top. Xiao Feng, co-head of China Industrial Research at Citic CLSA, said the top ten makers now hold 95% of the new energy vehicle space, compared to just 60% to 70% a few years ago. And that space includes both hybrids and battery electrics. Autohome, a local car listing platform, is showing huge markdowns, with 432,000 yuan off the Mercedes-Benz EQS EV and 147,000 yuan sliced off the Volvo XC70. Paul Gong, who heads China autos research at UBS, said this knife fight isn’t ending soon. “The price war could last for years,” he said. And just when you think things can’t get worse, Beijing shows up with new tax policies. Purchase tax is coming back. Trade-in subsidies are getting cut. UBS says the EV sales growth rate will likely fall by half next year, from around 20% in 2025. The market’s stuffed to the brim already. New energy vehicles made up 59.4% of new passenger car sales in November, according to the China Passenger Car Association. That’s a warning light, not a trophy. Chinese EV makers are pushing overseas as home market turns cold With fewer buyers at home, China’s EV makers are rushing abroad.Geely, based in Hangzhou, said its electric car exports quadrupled in the first half of the year. It shipped 184,000 vehicles, launched in six new countries, and now has a footprint in around 90 markets. Geely also opened factories in Egypt, the Middle East, and Indonesia. Right now, it’s second only to BYD in local EV sales. BYD is stretching out, too. The company exported over 131,000 cars in November, and its Hungary factory is expected to ramp up by 2026. Tu Le, managing director at Sino Auto, said Chinese companies and battery makers will “firmly stake their claims in Europe.” They’re not stopping at Berlin. They’re eyeing Detroit, too. Foreign automakers aren’t walking away from China either. Volkswagen is going all in.It set up joint ventures with Xpeng and Horizon Robotics, and its biggest R&D center outside Germany is now in Hefei, China. Last month, it confirmed it can now develop and approve cars locally, end to end. That speeds up everything, and the company plans new models for 2026. In the first three quarters of 2025, Volkswagen delivered 1.9 million cars in China, down 4%, which is less than the 2.4 million it pushed in Western Europe. Still, it’s not over for the Americans either. “It’s not lost for the U.S. automakers,” said Le. General Motors still pushes nearly 2 million cars a year in China. Both GM and Ford are using China for exports, but Le says only GM is anywhere close to building competitive local models. But no one’s safe. “In China, you could be on top one month, and by next quarter, you’re playing catch-up and wonder what happened,” said Le. No one’s crowned yet, and no one is safe.

This crucial metric, updated on March 15, 2025, provides investors with quantitative evidence about current market structure. The index’s modest one-point increase from 19 to 20 suggests incremental altcoin momentum while maintaining clear Bitcoin leadership. Market analysts worldwide monitor this indicator for signals about capital rotation patterns between digital assets. Understanding the Altcoin Season Index Methodology CoinMarketCap’s Altcoin Season Index employs a systematic approach to market analysis. The platform compares price performance across the top 100 cryptocurrencies, excluding stablecoins and wrapped tokens, against Bitcoin over rolling 90-day periods. This methodology creates an objective framework for evaluating relative strength. The index specifically measures what percentage of these major altcoins outperforms Bitcoin during the observation window. Consequently, the resulting score ranges from 0 to 100, with specific thresholds indicating different market phases. The cryptocurrency data platform establishes clear benchmarks for interpretation. A reading above 75 triggers an official “altcoin season” declaration, indicating widespread altcoin outperformance. Conversely, scores below 25 typically signal strong “Bitcoin seasons” where the pioneer cryptocurrency leads the market. The current 20 reading falls squarely within Bitcoin dominance territory. This quantitative approach helps investors move beyond anecdotal observations to data-driven decision making. Historical Context of Crypto Market Cycles Cryptocurrency markets have demonstrated cyclical behavior since Bitcoin’s 2009 inception. Historical data reveals alternating periods of Bitcoin dominance and altcoin expansion. The 2017-2018 cycle witnessed a dramatic altcoin season where the index approached 90. Similarly, the 2021 bull market saw extended altcoin outperformance during specific quarters. These historical patterns provide essential context for current readings. Market analysts note that Bitcoin typically leads during early bull market phases. Institutional adoption and macroeconomic factors often drive initial Bitcoin appreciation. Subsequently, capital frequently rotates into altcoins as investor confidence grows. The current 20 reading suggests we remain in this early phase. Historical precedent indicates that sustained index readings above 50 often precede broader altcoin rallies. However, past performance never guarantees future results in volatile cryptocurrency markets. Expert Analysis of Current Market Structure Leading cryptocurrency analysts emphasize the index’s current implications. “The Altcoin Season Index provides valuable perspective on market breadth,” explains Dr. Elena Rodriguez, Chief Research Officer at Digital Asset Analytics. “A reading of 20 tells us that approximately 80% of major altcoins continue underperforming Bitcoin. This suggests concentrated rather than distributed market strength.” Rodriguez’s research team tracks this metric alongside other indicators like Bitcoin dominance percentage and sector rotation patterns. Other experts highlight the index’s limitations. “While useful, the Altcoin Season Index measures only the top 100 projects,” notes Marcus Chen, founder of CryptoMetrics Lab. “Smaller capitalization altcoins sometimes move independently. Additionally, the 90-day window smooths short-term volatility but may lag rapid market shifts.” Chen recommends combining this index with on-chain metrics and sentiment analysis for comprehensive market assessment. Impact on Investment Strategies and Portfolio Allocation The current index reading influences professional and retail investment approaches. Portfolio managers typically adjust allocations based on market cycle phases. During Bitcoin-dominant periods, many increase Bitcoin exposure while maintaining selective altcoin positions. This strategic allocation balances potential returns with risk management. The 20 reading suggests continued caution toward broad altcoin exposure. Several key factors contribute to persistent Bitcoin strength: Institutional adoption: Major financial institutions continue Bitcoin integration Regulatory clarity: Bitcoin enjoys clearer regulatory treatment in many jurisdictions Market infrastructure: Bitcoin benefits from more developed trading and custody solutions Macroeconomic hedging: Investors increasingly view Bitcoin as digital gold during economic uncertainty These structural advantages help explain Bitcoin’s ongoing outperformance. Meanwhile, altcoin projects face greater regulatory scrutiny and infrastructure challenges. However, specific sectors like decentralized finance and layer-2 scaling solutions show relative strength even during Bitcoin-dominant periods. Comparative Performance Across Cryptocurrency Sectors Not all altcoin sectors respond identically during Bitcoin seasons. Analysis reveals performance variations across different cryptocurrency categories. Layer-1 blockchain platforms, decentralized finance protocols, and infrastructure projects demonstrate diverse behaviors. Some sectors maintain correlation with Bitcoin price movements, while others exhibit independent momentum. Recent 90-Day Performance by Cryptocurrency Category Category Average Performance Correlation with Bitcoin Bitcoin +42% 1.00 Major Layer-1 Platforms +28% 0.85 DeFi Protocols +35% 0.72 Infrastructure Projects +31% 0.78 Gaming/Metaverse +19% 0.65 This sector analysis reveals that while Bitcoin leads, certain altcoin categories show respectable performance. Decentralized finance protocols demonstrate particular resilience, averaging 35% gains despite the overall Bitcoin-dominant environment. These nuances matter for investors constructing diversified cryptocurrency portfolios. Technical and Fundamental Drivers of Current Trends Multiple technical and fundamental factors sustain Bitcoin’s current leadership position. On the technical side, Bitcoin’s upcoming halving event in April 2024 continues influencing market psychology. Historically, halving events have preceded extended bull markets, though with varying timelines. This anticipation supports Bitcoin’s relative strength. Fundamentally, Bitcoin benefits from its established network effects and security properties. The cryptocurrency maintains the largest market capitalization, highest liquidity, and most robust security model. These characteristics attract institutional capital seeking cryptocurrency exposure with reduced counterparty risk. Meanwhile, altcoin projects must demonstrate unique value propositions to attract investment during Bitcoin-dominant phases. Global Regulatory Environment and Market Implications The worldwide regulatory landscape significantly impacts cryptocurrency market dynamics. In 2025, regulatory clarity varies substantially across jurisdictions. Bitcoin generally enjoys more favorable treatment due to its classification as a commodity rather than security in major markets. This regulatory distinction creates investment advantages. Many altcoins face ongoing regulatory uncertainty regarding security classifications. This uncertainty potentially limits institutional participation and exchange listings. Consequently, regulatory developments represent crucial monitoring areas for market participants. Clearer regulatory frameworks for altcoins could facilitate increased investment and potentially shift the Altcoin Season Index upward. Conclusion CoinMarketCap’s Altcoin Season Index reading of 20 provides valuable insight into current cryptocurrency market structure. The metric confirms ongoing Bitcoin dominance in early 2025 while noting incremental altcoin momentum. Investors should interpret this data within broader market context, considering historical cycles, sector variations, and fundamental drivers. The index serves as one important tool among many for market analysis. As cryptocurrency markets evolve, monitoring this indicator alongside other metrics will remain essential for informed decision-making. The current phase suggests selective rather than broad altcoin exposure aligns with prevailing market conditions. FAQs Q1: What exactly does the Altcoin Season Index measure? The index measures what percentage of the top 100 cryptocurrencies (excluding stablecoins and wrapped tokens) outperforms Bitcoin over a 90-day period. A score above 75 indicates altcoin season, while scores below 25 typically signal Bitcoin season. Q2: How often does CoinMarketCap update the Altcoin Season Index? CoinMarketCap updates the index continuously based on real-time price data, providing investors with current market structure information. The platform calculates the metric using rolling 90-day performance windows. Q3: Does a low index reading mean all altcoins are performing poorly? Not necessarily. While the aggregate reading of 20 indicates most major altcoins underperform Bitcoin, specific sectors or individual projects may show strength. The index measures broad market trends rather than individual asset performance. Q4: What typically triggers a transition from Bitcoin season to altcoin season? Historical transitions often follow increased investor risk appetite, Bitcoin price consolidation, specific catalyst events for altcoin projects, or broader cryptocurrency adoption expanding beyond Bitcoin-focused investment. Q5: How should investors use the Altcoin Season Index in decision-making? Investors should consider the index as one data point among many. It provides context about market breadth and rotation patterns but should combine with fundamental analysis, risk assessment, and portfolio strategy rather than dictating decisions alone.

Mutuum Finance has now entered Phase 7 after a very quick sellout in Phase 6. With many people currently looking to know what cryptocurrency to buy now, MUTM is quickly becoming one of the best cryptocurrency to buy because of the very low market price and the rapidly increasing demand. Currently, the token remains below $0.05. The Launch of Phase 7 Amidst High Demand Mutuum Finance is currently in Presale phase 7, and the response has not diminished. In fact, phase 7 is already filling up fast, and it is thought to be the final opportunity to acquire MUTM at the rate of $0.04. Mutuum Finance has accumulated $19,500,000 in sales of their token, MUTM. Since the presale started, and the number of MUTM holders now stands at 18560, indicative of massive support. In phase 7, the token is currently being sold at the price of $0.04, an implication of a 300% rise compared to the previous phase of $0.01 in phase 1. Why Buyers Feel the Rush There is great pressure for investors to make their moves now. Phase 7 is selling out quickly. Once it is closed, Phase 8 will open at $0.045. This is near a 20% increase. Waiting even for a short while will result in higher costs for the same token. The MUTM launch price is at $0.06. This will give those who are already buying an expected 410% ROI. This increasing difference between the present and future costs is why MUTM is one of the best cryptocurrencies to buy for the short term. Designed for Use, Not just Hype Mutuum Finance is unique in that it was designed for actual use in the world of DeFi. The purpose of Mutuum Finance is to provide a means for lending and borrowing, driving demand for the token. The MUTM token has actual use within its own network. It is more than just a cheap crypto token in this regard. It also has an ongoing audit by Halborn Security specifically for its contracts related to lending & borrowing. Strong Progress on Development There has been transparency about the development process from the team. In one such announcement, the team revealed that the launch of the V1 protocol is scheduled on the Sepolia testnet for Q4 2025. This is expected to be followed by the development of the first operational product. This will be the first hard development milestone because the company has particular goals that must be achieved. New Tools Keep Users Busy Mutuum Finance has introduced a dashboard and a leaderboard for the top 50 holders. In its interior, there is a daily 24-Hour Leaderboard. It resets daily at 00:00 UTC. Each day, the highest-ranked user gets a $500 MUTM reward if they’ve made a transaction. It acts as a motivation to users to ensure that the network stays busy. Given the speed at which Phase 7 has rolled in, the high funding numbers, as well as the progress being made with development, Mutuum Finance has made significant inroads concerning the next crypto that should be considered.

Owen Lau, a managing director at the New York-based brokerage firm Clear Street, identifies monetary policy as the primary catalyst that could unlock significant capital flows into digital assets. This assessment arrives as global markets scrutinize the Fed’s latest communications for clues about its long-term strategy. Fed Rate Cuts Emerge as Primary 2026 Crypto Market Catalyst Financial analysts consistently monitor central bank policies for their profound impact on all asset classes. Consequently, the cryptocurrency sector remains particularly sensitive to shifts in the macroeconomic environment. In a detailed statement reported by financial news outlet Cointelegraph, analyst Owen Lau provided a clear rationale. He explained that a cycle of lower interest rates typically reduces the yield on traditional safe-haven assets like government bonds. This environment, therefore, pushes investors to seek higher returns elsewhere. “Lower interest rates would likely drive both retail and institutional investors into the crypto market,” Lau stated. This potential shift represents a fundamental change in investment psychology. For instance, institutional capital often requires a favorable cost-of-capital backdrop before committing to newer, volatile asset classes. The relationship between interest rates and crypto valuations is not merely theoretical. Historically, periods of accommodative monetary policy have correlated with increased risk appetite and capital inflows into growth-oriented investments. The prospect of Fed rate cuts in 2026 suggests a potential replay of these dynamics on a potentially larger scale, given the market’s increased maturity. Liquidity Injection: Lower rates increase system-wide liquidity, some of which inevitably seeks asymmetric returns. Portfolio Rebalancing: Investors re-allocate funds from lower-yielding bonds to assets with higher growth potential. Reduced Opportunity Cost: Holding non-yielding assets like Bitcoin becomes more attractive when the alternative (cash or bonds) offers minimal return. Deciphering the Federal Reserve’s Policy Signals The Federal Reserve provides critical guidance through its published meeting minutes and official statements. Recently, the central bank released the minutes from its December Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting. These documents offer a window into the deliberations of the world’s most influential monetary authority. Importantly, the Fed noted it “is prepared to adjust monetary policy as appropriate if risks emerge.” This standard clause underscores the data-dependent nature of modern central banking. However, for market participants, the key interpretation revolves around the conditions that would prompt a shift toward rate cuts. The Fed’s dual mandate focuses on maximum employment and price stability. Therefore, sustained signs of cooling inflation and a softening labor market typically pave the way for a more dovish stance. Market analysts currently parse economic indicators like the Consumer Price Index (CPI) and unemployment claims to forecast the Fed’s timing. The projected pace of cuts—whether swift and deep or slow and measured—carries different implications. A rapid easing cycle could signal underlying economic concerns, potentially triggering volatility. Conversely, a methodical, data-driven reduction might foster a more stable environment conducive to sustained capital deployment. Potential Fed Policy Paths & Crypto Market Implications Policy Pace Likely Economic Signal Projected Crypto Market Impact Fast & Deep Cuts Responding to significant economic slowdown or crisis. High initial volatility, followed by potential massive liquidity-driven rally. Slow & Measured Cuts Confident management of a soft landing; controlled disinflation. More stable, fundamentals-driven growth; sustained institutional interest. Paused or Delayed Cuts Persistent inflation or strong economic data. Continued pressure on risk assets; potential consolidation or downturn. Expert Analysis on Institutional Adoption Pathways Owen Lau’s perspective carries weight due to his role at Clear Street, a firm specializing in modernizing capital markets infrastructure. His analysis bridges traditional finance and the digital asset ecosystem. The entry of institutional investors is not a monolithic event but a gradual process influenced by several factors beyond just interest rates. These include regulatory clarity, the development of robust custody solutions, and the availability of regulated financial products like Bitcoin ETFs. Nevertheless, monetary policy acts as the overarching tide that lifts or lowers all boats. A lower-rate environment decreases the hedging and carry costs associated with large-scale crypto investments. It also makes the narrative of digital assets as “digital gold” or an inflation hedge more compelling if traditional fiat yields are diminishing. The convergence of a friendly Fed policy with maturing market infrastructure could create a powerful synergy for the 2026 landscape. Historical precedent offers some insight. The post-2020 period of near-zero rates and quantitative easing coincided with a historic bull run in cryptocurrencies. While the market structure has evolved, the fundamental relationship between cheap money and risk-asset appreciation remains a cornerstone of financial theory. Analysts now model how this relationship will manifest in a market with deeper liquidity and more sophisticated participants. The Interplay of Macroeconomic Forces and Digital Assets Cryptocurrencies no longer trade in a vacuum, isolated from global financial currents. Today, they react to U.S. dollar strength, Treasury yield movements, and equity market sentiment. This increased correlation, especially in times of stress, highlights the asset class’s integration into the broader financial system. Therefore, the Fed’s actions in 2025 and 2026 will reverberate through multiple channels. First, the direct channel involves investment allocation as described by Lau. Second, an indirect channel exists through the impact on technology stocks and growth equities, which often move in tandem with crypto assets. A bullish environment for Nasdaq, frequently fueled by lower rates, tends to create a supportive backdrop for crypto. Third, the psychological channel of “risk-on” versus “risk-off” sentiment is powerfully influenced by central bank messaging. Other global central banks, including the European Central Bank and the Bank of England, are on similar policy trajectories. Their synchronized or divergent actions will influence global dollar liquidity—a key metric for all internationally traded assets. A globally coordinated easing cycle could unleash a tidal wave of liquidity, while a fragmented approach might lead to more complex, region-specific market dynamics. Conclusion The pace of Federal Reserve interest rate cuts stands as the definitive macroeconomic variable for the 2026 cryptocurrency market. Analyst Owen Lau’s assessment underscores a fundamental shift where traditional monetary policy directly steers capital flows into digital assets. While regulatory developments and technological innovation provide the foundation, the Fed’s decisions on the cost of capital will likely determine the scale and timing of the next major market phase. Investors and observers must therefore monitor inflation data, employment reports, and FOMC communications with heightened attention, as these indicators will collectively chart the course for crypto market performance in the coming years. FAQs Q1: Why do Federal Reserve rate cuts affect the cryptocurrency market? Rate cuts lower returns on traditional safe-haven assets like bonds, making higher-risk, higher-potential-return assets like cryptocurrencies more attractive to both retail and institutional investors seeking yield. Q2: What did the Fed say in its December 2024 FOMC meeting minutes? The Federal Reserve stated it is prepared to adjust monetary policy as appropriate if risks emerge that could impede achieving its economic goals, indicating a data-dependent but flexible approach to future rate decisions. Q3: How could institutional investment change if rates fall? Lower rates reduce the cost of capital and hedging for large institutions, making substantial allocations to volatile assets like cryptocurrency more financially viable and strategically appealing within a diversified portfolio. Q4: Is the crypto market’s reaction to rate cuts guaranteed? While historical correlation exists, the reaction is not guaranteed. Market response also depends on concurrent factors like regulatory clarity, global economic health, and asset-specific developments within the crypto ecosystem. Q5: What other economic indicators should be watched alongside Fed announcements? Key indicators include Consumer Price Index (CPI) reports for inflation, unemployment data, GDP growth figures, and broader equity market performance, as these all inform the Fed’s policy decisions and overall market sentiment.

Metaplanet Spent $451 Million On Bitcoin In Q4 2025 As revealed by Metaplanet CEO Simon Gerovich in a new X post , the Bitcoin treasury company participated in some fresh accumulation over Q4 2025. In total, the firm added 4,279 BTC at an average buying price of $105,412 during this period. The latest announcement has followed three months of no new purchases from Metaplanet. The last time that the Japanese company added more BTC was in September, with two big buys involving more than 5,000 tokens each occurring in the second half of that month. About a week or so after the second of those purchases, Bitcoin formed a high above $126,000, which has acted as the top of the bull market so far. The firm has not been making announcements since then, which may be due to the fact that the asset has witnessed a notable drawdown. Nonetheless, the new announcement suggests that Metaplanet was silently buying tokens in the background, with the company only choosing to unveil it as 2025 approaches an end. As a result of this accumulation, Metaplanet’s holdings have grown significantly. Before the Q4 2025 buying spree, the firm held 30,823 BTC. Now, that figure has risen to 35,102 BTC. The Q4 2025 treasury expansion cost the company a total of $451.06 million, but due to the decline in the cryptocurrency’s price recently, the value of the tokens is down to $376.26 million today. The new accumulation isn’t the only portion of the Bitcoin treasury that has gone underwater; the firm’s entire holdings are in fact currently in a state of loss. With a cost basis of $107,606 per token, Metaplanet’s 35,102 BTC holdings cost $3.78 billion to assemble. Today, these coins are worth just $3.08 billion. Metaplanet is currently the fourth largest corporate holder of BTC in the world, as rankings from BitcoinTreasuries.net show. Even with its Q4 2025 buying, Metaplanet is still more than 8,000 BTC behind Twenty One Capital, which holds 43,514 BTC. Thus, Simon’s company will need a couple more purchases of this size to close in the gap. In the table, it’s apparent that Strategy , the OG treasury firm, is in a different stratosphere from the rest of the names on the list, with its total Bitcoin holdings standing at 672,497 BTC right now. Unlike Metaplanet, the Michael Saylor-led company continued to make regular purchase announcements even as BTC went through its bearish shift. The latest of these came up this Monday, with the firm loading up on 1,229 BTC. BTC Price At the time of writing, Bitcoin is floating around $88,000, unchanged from one week ago.",Bitcoin News|bitcoin|Bitcoin Treasury|Bitcoin Treasury Metaplanet|btc|BTCUSDT|Metaplanet,EN,0,0,BTC|REGULATION|DIGITAL ASSET TREASURY|MACROECONOMICS|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-12-31 01:00:20

Repeated attempts to reclaim higher levels have stalled, reinforcing growing skepticism among analysts who now openly discuss the risk of a broader bear market extending into 2026. Sentiment remains fragile, dominated by caution and reduced risk appetite, as traders wait for clearer confirmation of the next directional move.

Some investors argue that Bitcoin is entering a transitional phase rather than a full trend reversal. According to on-chain analyst Axel Adler, the current setup in Bitcoin’s “Supply in Profit” metric offers important context. Adler highlights that Supply in Profit has fallen sharply from October peaks above 19 million BTC to roughly 13.5 million BTC following the correction from all-time highs. This decline pushed the short-term 30-day moving average well below the 90-day average, creating a gap of around 1.75 million BTC. While a similar configuration appeared in 2022 before an extended bearish period, Adler notes a key difference this time: the 365-day moving average remains historically elevated. Importantly, the 30-day average appears to have formed a local bottom in mid-December and is beginning to stabilize. Adler argues that if Bitcoin can hold current price levels or higher, this stabilization could mark the early groundwork for a renewed bullish phase later in 2026. Supply in Profit Signals a Critical Inflection Window Axel Adler also shared a forward-looking forecast chart tracking the convergence between the 30-day and 90-day moving averages of Bitcoin’s Supply in Profit metric, offering a potential roadmap for the next structural shift. The model extrapolates current rates of change to estimate when a bullish configuration—defined by SMA 30 crossing above SMA 90—could emerge. According to Adler’s analysis, the gap between these two moving averages is currently narrowing at a pace of roughly 28,000 BTC per day. Importantly, this convergence is not being driven by a sharp recovery in Supply in Profit, but by a mechanical decline in the SMA 90. As peak October values, when Supply in Profit reached 19–20 million BTC, roll out of the 90-day calculation window, downward pressure on the longer average creates a temporary “tailwind” for convergence. This effect is expected to persist through late January. If current conditions hold, Adler projects a potential bullish cross forming between late February and early March. However, the forecast remains highly price-sensitive. Supply elasticity to price is estimated at 1.3x, meaning a 10% price decline could trigger a 13% drop in Supply in Profit. The $70,000 level is critical according to the forecast. Below it, SMA 30 would likely fall faster than SMA 90, invalidating the convergence thesis and reopening a 2022-style prolonged recovery scenario. Related Reading: Chainlink Shows Strong Accumulation Signal: LINK Exchange Liquidity Dries Up Bitcoin Price Struggles Below Key Resistance Bitcoin continues to trade below the $90,000 threshold, reflecting a market that remains structurally weak despite short-term stabilization. The chart shows BTC consolidating after a sharp breakdown from the $100,000–$105,000 region, a move that decisively flipped prior support into resistance. This rejection marked a clear loss of bullish control and initiated a deeper corrective phase. Price now compresses below the downward-sloping 50-day and 100-day moving averages.. This configuration reinforces the prevailing bearish trend and suggests that upside attempts are likely to face supply pressure. The 200-day moving average, currently well above spot price, highlights how far BTC has drifted from its longer-term trend equilibrium. Related Reading: Why $100,000 Is Bitcoin’s Most Important Resistance Level Momentum has cooled notably since the November sell-off. While selling intensity has eased, the absence of strong bullish volume indicates that buyers remain cautious. The recent price action resembles a consolidation range rather than a reversal, with BTC oscillating between roughly $85,000 and $90,000. This behavior often reflects indecision rather than accumulation. For now, $90,000 remains the critical level bulls must reclaim to shift sentiment meaningfully. Failure to do so keeps downside risks in play, with $85,000 acting as near-term support. Until price regains key moving averages, the broader structure favors continued range-bound or corrective price action.

The OG crypto had gone on a monster rally earlier this year making one all-time high after another, mostly thanks to Trump taking back the White House. But recent uncertainties and intense leverage have dragged Bitcoin down enough to end 2025 in the red. Bitcoin’s price last traded at $88,242, leaving Bitcoin down about 6% for the year and roughly 30% below its record high of nearly $126,000, which was reached in early October, according to data from CoinGecko. ETFs and regulation drive rebound expectations Some analysts still expect Bitcoin to rebound in early 2026, even if the recovery does not last.Citi Research’s says near-term support could come from the expansion of crypto exchange-traded funds, which continue to bring better access for both retail and institutional investors. In a note written Dec. 18, Citi analyst Alex Saunders said Bitcoin predictions assume adoption continues and ETF inflows reach $15 billion, but that level can only rally prices in the short term. Citi has reportedly set a base-case target of $143,000 over the next 12 months for Bitcoin. The bank also shared a bull-case target of $189,000 and a bear-case level of $78,000 for the same period. Meanwhile, attention remains on Strategy, the largest corporate holder of Bitcoin, as another signal for price direction. In a Dec. 3 note, JPMorgan strategist Nikolaos Panigirtzoglou pointed to the company’s enterprise-value-to-holdings ratio, which remains above 1.0, a level that reassures markets that the company can avoid selling its holdings during stress. “If this ratio stays above 1.0 and MicroStrategy can eventually avoid selling bitcoins, markets will likely be reassured and the worst for bitcoin prices will likely be behind us,” Nikolaos wrote. “We also find encouraging MicroStrategy’s creation of a $1.4bn reserve fund for future dividend and interest payments,” Nikolaos added, saying that it reduces the risk of forced sales. Though according to Cryptoquant, Bitcoin’s long-term holders continue to focus on the traditional four-year cycle that has historically determined prices. Jaime Leverton, chief executive officer of ReserveOne, said on CNBC’s Squawk Box that the old cycle is fading as the industry gains stronger support in the United States. “I actually think we’ll see a new Bitcoin all-time high next year, which would really be the final nail in the coffin for the historical cycle,” Jaime said.

Speaking recently, Zhao projected that Pakistan could emerge as one of the world’s crypto leaders by the year 2030. This prediction, made in an interview with the Pakistan Crypto Council’s CEO and reported by Cointelegraph, hinges on the nation’s ability to sustain its current regulatory and adoption trajectory. The remarks spotlight a nation often discussed for its economic challenges rather than its technological potential, offering a fresh narrative for the global cryptocurrency landscape. Changpeng Zhao’s Vision for Pakistan’s Crypto Future Changpeng Zhao’s analysis provides a structured framework for Pakistan’s potential ascent. He specifically commended the country’s leadership for what he termed “rapid execution” in recognizing the burgeoning demand for digital assets. Furthermore, Zhao highlighted a critical demographic advantage: Pakistan’s large, young, and technologically adept population. This cohort represents both a massive user base and a potential talent pool for blockchain development. For context, over 60% of Pakistan’s population is under the age of 30, a statistic that aligns perfectly with global crypto adoption trends favoring younger generations. Zhao’s comments, therefore, are not mere speculation but an observation grounded in verifiable demographic and behavioral data. The Foundation of Regulatory Momentum The pathway to leadership, as outlined by Zhao, is contingent on maintaining regulatory momentum. In recent years, Pakistani authorities have engaged in serious discussions about digital asset frameworks. The State Bank of Pakistan and the Securities and Exchange Commission of Pakistan (SECP) have initiated studies and consultations. For instance, the SECP has been exploring regulatory models for digital assets, looking at jurisdictions like Singapore and the United Kingdom for guidance. This cautious yet proactive approach aims to balance innovation with consumer protection and financial integrity. Sustaining this delicate balance is the central challenge Zhao identifies for Pakistan’s crypto regulation journey toward 2030. Global Context and Pakistan’s Unique Position To understand the weight of Zhao’s prediction, one must examine the global crypto landscape. Leadership is not defined by adoption alone but by a combination of factors including regulatory clarity, technological innovation, and market influence. Currently, hubs like Singapore, Switzerland, and the United Arab Emirates set benchmarks for regulatory frameworks. Meanwhile, nations like India and Nigeria lead in raw user adoption rates. Pakistan’s opportunity lies in synthesizing these elements. Its large, unbanked population presents a prime use case for blockchain-based financial solutions, a point often emphasized by financial inclusion advocates. The following table contrasts key factors for crypto leadership: Factor Current Leader Example Pakistan’s Potential Regulatory Clarity Singapore (Payment Services Act) Developing framework via SECP Youth Adoption Nigeria (High peer-to-peer volume) ~64% population under 30 Tech Talent United States (Developer hubs) Growing IT export sector Financial Inclusion Drive Kenya (Mobile money success) ~100 million adults, significant unbanked This comparative view illustrates that Pakistan possesses foundational elements observed in other successful markets. However, the convergence of these factors under a coherent national strategy remains the critical next step. Demographics as a Decisive Driver The role of Pakistan’s demographic profile cannot be overstated. A young population typically correlates with higher digital literacy and greater openness to new financial technologies. Reports from blockchain analytics firms consistently show that regions with younger median ages see faster adoption of cryptocurrencies. This trend is driven by several factors: Remittance Efficiency: Pakistan is a top recipient of global remittances. Crypto offers a potentially faster and cheaper corridor. Inflation Hedge: In economies with currency volatility, digital assets are often explored as alternative stores of value. Entrepreneurial Spirit: Young Pakistanis are increasingly launching tech startups, with blockchain as a natural frontier. Consequently, the “demand for digital assets” that Zhao referenced is not abstract. It is a tangible response to specific economic conditions and opportunities perceived by its youth. Challenges on the Road to 2030 Leadership While the potential is significant, the path is fraught with substantial hurdles. Achieving digital asset adoption at a leadership scale requires overcoming deep-seated challenges. First, Pakistan must finalize and implement a clear, comprehensive regulatory framework. Ambiguity can stifle investment and innovation. Second, the country faces persistent macroeconomic pressures, including inflation and currency devaluation, which can create a volatile environment for any new asset class. Third, technological infrastructure, particularly consistent internet access in rural areas, requires continued investment. Finally, Pakistan must navigate complex international financial regulations and anti-money laundering standards to ensure its crypto ecosystem integrates smoothly with the global economy. Success depends on addressing these areas simultaneously. Expert Perspectives on Viability Financial technology analysts echo both Zhao’s optimism and caution. Dr. Ayesha Khan, a fintech researcher focusing on South Asia, notes, “Pakistan’s crypto journey mirrors early stages seen in other emerging markets. The regulatory intent is there, but the test will be in execution and creating an environment that attracts legitimate projects while deterring bad actors.” Meanwhile, the International Monetary Fund has engaged with Pakistan on the potential macroeconomic implications of crypto assets, emphasizing the need for a risk-based regulatory approach. These expert views underscore that Zhao’s prediction is a conditional one, reliant on strategic policy decisions made in the coming years. Conclusion Changpeng Zhao’s projection that Pakistan could become a crypto leader by 2030 provides a compelling, evidence-based vision for the country’s digital future. It is a forecast rooted in the observable momentum of its regulatory discussions and the undeniable force of its demographic dividend. However, leadership is not assured. It demands sustained, strategic action across regulation, education, infrastructure, and international cooperation. If Pakistan can maintain its current momentum and translate its potential into structured policy, Zhao’s prediction may well transition from hopeful commentary to economic reality, reshaping the nation’s financial landscape and its position in the global digital economy. FAQs Q1: What exactly did Changpeng Zhao say about Pakistan and crypto? Former Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao stated that Pakistan has the potential to become one of the world’s leaders in cryptocurrency by 2030. He praised the country’s rapid regulatory progress and highlighted its large, young, tech-friendly population as key drivers for this potential. Q2: Why is Pakistan’s young population important for crypto adoption? Younger populations globally show higher rates of digital literacy and openness to new technologies like cryptocurrency. With over 60% of Pakistanis under 30, this creates a vast potential user base and talent pool for blockchain development and digital asset adoption. Q3: What are the main challenges Pakistan faces in becoming a crypto leader? Key challenges include establishing clear and comprehensive cryptocurrency regulations, managing macroeconomic instability, improving digital infrastructure nationwide, and ensuring compliance with international financial standards to foster a secure and sustainable ecosystem. Q4: How is Pakistan currently regulating cryptocurrency? Regulatory bodies like the Securities and Exchange Commission of Pakistan (SECP) are actively studying frameworks. The approach is currently cautious, with authorities examining models from other countries to develop rules that encourage innovation while managing risks related to fraud and financial stability. Q5: What would ‘crypto leadership’ for Pakistan realistically look like by 2030? Leadership would likely involve Pakistan being recognized as a regional hub for blockchain innovation, with a clear regulatory framework that attracts investment, a high rate of responsible digital asset usage among its citizens, and a thriving ecosystem of local crypto and Web3 businesses contributing to the economy.

Announced in early 2025, this collaboration aims to construct critical infrastructure that seamlessly connects real-world commerce with the burgeoning AI economy. Consequently, this initiative promises to expand practical cryptocurrency utility for millions of users and merchants worldwide. AEON United Stables Partnership: A Technical Deep Dive The core of the AEON United Stables partnership involves a dual integration across AEON’s ecosystem. First, AEON will add United Stables (U) as a supported payment method on its AEON Pay service. Second, the company will integrate U as a settlement asset on the BNB Chain via its proprietary x402 Facilitator. This technical architecture is specifically designed to enhance transaction speed and reduce costs for cross-border settlements. AEON Pay, accessible currently through a Telegram Mini App, already supports integration with major cryptocurrency wallets. These include Binance Wallet, OKX Wallet, and Bybit. The addition of United Stables significantly broadens the available options for users. Furthermore, this integration directly supports AEON’s stated mission to build a robust payment and settlement layer tailored for the AI economy. The Expanding Reach of Real-World Crypto Payments This partnership has immediate, tangible implications for global commerce. As a direct result, AEON Pay users can now transact with United Stables (U) at a network of over 50 million affiliated merchants. Initial focus regions include high-growth markets in Southeast Asia, Latin America, and Africa. The company has also confirmed plans for further geographical expansion throughout 2025. The move addresses a persistent challenge in cryptocurrency adoption: bridging the gap between digital asset holdings and everyday purchases. By leveraging a stablecoin, the partnership mitigates the price volatility typically associated with cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin or Ethereum. Therefore, both merchants and consumers gain a predictable medium of exchange. This stability is crucial for fostering trust and encouraging widespread use in daily transactions. Expert Analysis: Why This Partnership Matters Now Industry analysts point to several converging trends that make this partnership particularly timely. The global AI economy is projected to grow exponentially, creating new demand for automated, efficient, and borderless payment rails. Simultaneously, stablecoins have matured from speculative assets into legitimate tools for payment and settlement. A 2024 report from the Bank for International Settlements highlighted the growing use of stablecoins in remittances and merchant services. By choosing BNB Chain for settlement, AEON and United Stables tap into an ecosystem known for high throughput and relatively low fees. This technical choice is strategic for scaling micro-payments, which are anticipated to be a hallmark of AI-driven services. For instance, an AI agent might need to pay a small fee for a data query or a computational task in real-time. The combined infrastructure of AEON Pay and United Stables on BNB Chain is engineered to facilitate such use cases efficiently. Building the Infrastructure for an AI-Driven Financial Future The collaboration extends beyond simple payment processing. The integration with the x402 Facilitator suggests a focus on deeper settlement layer functionality. In blockchain terms, a facilitator often acts as a middleware component that streamlines complex processes like cross-chain communication or compliance checks. This indicates that the partnership is laying groundwork for more sophisticated financial instruments and automated settlements within the AI sector. Potential applications are vast. Consider an autonomous AI freelancer platform where algorithms complete tasks and receive payment in U stablecoins settled instantly via AEON. Another example is AI-managed investment portfolios that use the infrastructure for rebalancing assets across different protocols. The partnership effectively provides the monetary plumbing for these next-generation economic activities. Enhanced Merchant Adoption: Reduces friction for shops to accept crypto by using a price-stable asset. User Accessibility: Leverages the massive reach of Telegram and popular wallets to lower the entry barrier.

This filing, submitted to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) in March 2025, targets a diverse basket of assets including AAVE, UNI, and ZEC. Consequently, this proposal marks a pivotal expansion beyond the established Bitcoin and Ethereum ETF products. The application details a novel 60% direct spot investment strategy, potentially reshaping how traditional investors gain exposure to the crypto ecosystem. Bitwise Crypto ETFs: Deconstructing the 11-Fund Proposal Bitwise’s latest filing seeks to list ETFs for 11 distinct cryptocurrencies. The list prominently features governance tokens from leading decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols, such as Aave (AAVE) and Uniswap (UNI). Furthermore, it includes privacy-focused assets like Zcash (ZEC), newer layer-1 blockchain tokens including NEAR, SUI, and TRON’s TRX, and other specialized digital assets like Ethena’s ENA and Bittensor’s TAO. Each proposed fund would operate under a consistent structural framework. According to the filing, a minimum of 60% of each fund’s assets would be held directly in the underlying spot cryptocurrency. The remaining portion would be allocated to other exchange-traded products (ETPs) that track the same asset. Additionally, the funds reserve the right to use futures contracts and other derivatives for precise exposure management. This hybrid model aims to combine the direct ownership benefits of a spot ETF with the flexibility of derivative instruments. The Strategic Composition and Target Assets The selection of assets reveals a calculated strategy by Bitwise. The inclusion of AAVE and UNI directly targets the growing institutional interest in decentralized finance. These tokens govern two of the largest DeFi protocols by total value locked. Meanwhile, assets like NEAR and SUI represent investments in competing smart contract platforms aiming to scale blockchain technology. The filing also covers a wide range of crypto sectors, from artificial intelligence (Bittensor’s TAO) to real-world asset tokenization. This diversified approach suggests Bitwise is betting on multiple narratives within the broader digital asset space rather than a single trend. The 60/40 spot-to-ETP ratio is a critical detail, designed to provide robust underlying asset backing while maintaining operational liquidity. SEC Implications and the Evolving Regulatory Landscape This filing arrives during a period of intense scrutiny and gradual acceptance from U.S. regulators. The SEC’s approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs in January 2024 established a crucial precedent. However, approving ETFs for a broader set of altcoins presents new regulatory challenges. The central question remains the legal classification of each asset. The SEC has previously suggested that many cryptocurrencies, beyond Bitcoin, could be considered securities. Bitwise’s filing, therefore, acts as a direct test case. It challenges the SEC to apply its regulatory framework to a suite of complex digital assets. Approval would signal a major shift, effectively granting a regulatory stamp to a wider crypto market segment. Conversely, rejection or delay would reaffirm the current cautious stance and likely focus future ETF applications only on the largest assets like Ethereum. Expert Analysis on Approval Prospects and Timeline Financial legal experts point to a potentially lengthy review process. “The SEC will meticulously examine the liquidity, custody solutions, and market manipulation safeguards for each of these 11 assets,” notes a former SEC enforcement attorney specializing in digital assets. The process involves public commentary periods and potential revisions, often taking several months to over a year. Analysts from Bloomberg Intelligence have previously modeled approval probabilities for Ethereum ETFs, but models for this broader basket are less established. The outcome may hinge on ongoing litigation and legislative developments, such as the FIT for the 21st Century Act, which seeks to clarify crypto market regulation. Bitwise’s established track record as a registered investment adviser and its existing suite of crypto index products may bolster its application’s credibility with regulators. Potential Market Impact and Investor Accessibility The launch of these ETFs would dramatically lower the barrier to entry for a vast pool of investors. Currently, direct investment in assets like AAVE or ZEC requires navigating cryptocurrency exchanges, managing private keys, and understanding wallet technology. An ETF, traded on traditional exchanges like NYSE Arca, simplifies this process entirely. Investors could buy and sell shares through their existing brokerage accounts. This accessibility could funnel significant new capital into the crypto markets. Moreover, the structure provides a regulated, audited, and custodially secure vehicle—a key concern for institutional allocators like pension funds and endowments. The 60% direct spot holding is particularly significant. It ensures a substantial portion of the fund’s capital directly purchases and holds the native tokens, creating consistent buy-side pressure on the underlying markets. Comparative Analysis with Existing Crypto ETPs Product Type Example Primary Holding Key Advantage Bitwise Proposed ETF Bitwise AAVE ETF 60% Spot AAVE, 40% AAVE ETPs Direct spot exposure, regulated structure Futures-based ETF ProShares Bitcoin Strategy ETF (BITO) Bitcoin Futures Contracts No direct custody needed Grantor Trust Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) Direct Spot Bitcoin Direct asset backing European ETP 21Shares AAVE ETP (AAVE) Direct Spot AAVE Available in non-U.S. markets The table highlights Bitwise’s hybrid model. It differs from futures-based ETFs, which carry roll cost risks, and from grantor trusts, which often trade at significant premiums or discounts to net asset value. While similar spot products exist in Europe, a U.S.-listed ETF would tap into the world’s largest capital market. Conclusion Bitwise’s filing for 11 new crypto ETFs represents a bold strategic push into the next frontier of digital asset investment products. By targeting assets like AAVE and UNI with a 60% spot-backed model, the firm is testing the boundaries of current SEC policy. The proposal’s success hinges on regulatory interpretation, market infrastructure, and demonstrated investor protection mechanisms. If approved, these Bitwise crypto ETFs would unlock unprecedented mainstream access to a diversified portfolio of cryptocurrency innovations, potentially catalyzing the next wave of institutional adoption. The market now awaits the SEC’s response, which will set a definitive course for the integration of altcoins into the regulated financial mainstream. FAQs Q1: What cryptocurrencies are included in Bitwise’s new ETF filing? Bitwise’s filing proposes ETFs for 11 assets: AAVE, UNI, ZEC, CC, ENA, HYPE, NEAR, STRK, SUI, TAO, and TRX. This list includes DeFi governance tokens, layer-1 blockchain tokens, and other specialized digital assets. Q2: How would these proposed ETFs be structured? Each ETF would invest at least 60% of its assets directly in the spot (actual) cryptocurrency. The remaining portion (up to 40%) would be allocated to other exchange-traded products that hold the same asset. The funds may also use derivatives like futures for exposure management. Q3: Why is the 60% direct spot investment important? This structure ensures a majority of the fund’s capital directly purchases and holds the underlying tokens. This creates tangible buy-side demand in the crypto markets and provides shareholders with more direct economic exposure compared to a fund holding only futures contracts. Q4: What is the main regulatory hurdle for these ETFs? The primary hurdle is the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission’s (SEC) view on whether these specific cryptocurrencies are classified as securities or commodities. The SEC has been hesitant to approve spot ETFs for assets it considers securities, which has been a point of contention for many altcoins. Q5: When could these Bitwise crypto ETFs potentially launch? There is no guaranteed timeline. The SEC review process for novel products is often lengthy, involving multiple rounds of comments and revisions. Based on prior ETF approvals, the process could take anywhere from several months to over a year, assuming the application is ultimately approved.

The move comes as the court reviews a potential retrial for two brothers accused of exploiting the Ethereum blockchain to obtain $25 million. In a filing dated Tuesday, December 30, in the US District Court for the Southern District of New York, interim US Attorney for the Southern District of New York, Jay Clayton wrote to Jessica Clarke, a United States district judge in New York requesting her to decline the DeFi Education Fund’s (DEF) brief while the court evaluates a motion to withdraw the allegations raised against Anton and James Peraire-Bueno. US Attorney Clayton raised concerns about DEF’s amicus brief In a statement, US Attorney Clayton argued that DEF’s amicus brief, which is disconnected from the trial record, restates some legal claims that the court has already rejected. He further explained, “Since the Court has already made decisions on the legal matters discussed in the amicus brief and DEF does not provide any new information relevant to the current motion, their submission is unlikely to help the Court in considering these specific issues [related to a motion for acquittal].” Considering the intense nature of the situation, reports dated November noted that Judge Clarke declared a mistrial just after jurors found it difficult to decide whether the two brothers should be pronounced guilty or not guilty. Regarding the case raised against the brothers, sources close to the situation claimed that they were accused of inappropriately utilizing automated maximal extractable value (MEV) bots for their own benefit. Later in the week, the US government requested that the court consider setting a retrial date for either late February or early March 2026. At this point, a draft representing the DEF brief, issued on December 19, illustrated that the organization supported the motion to clear or withdraw the claims against the two brothers. According to them, the case presented significant consequences for the industry. DEF further commented on the matter, stating that, “[P]rosecutions like this one create confusion and fear among software developers, discouraging involvement in DeFi and pushing participants to other countries”. They added, “The DOJ should not rush into indictments based on misinterpretations of current laws, as this will hinder growth by creating uncertainty about the rules.” Uncertainties surrounding the two brothers’ fate raise controversy in the ecosystem The announcement regarding the US government’s opposition to the Defi Education Fund’s brief prompted several reporters to reach out to the organization for comment on the situation. However, it declined to respond. Even with this decline, analysts noted that several individuals in the crypto industry are still paying close attention to the possibility of how this case could impact MEV-related activities. The individual adopted this move at a time when uncertainties surrounding the fate of the Peraire-Bueno brothers grew intense. Meanwhile, reports unveiled that Coin Center, a leading non-profit research and advocacy center focused on crypto-related matters, issued an amicus brief during the criminal trial. Sources claimed that this brief opposed the US government’s outlook. As a result, prosecutors requested the court to discard the brief. On the other hand, another reliable source disclosed that the two brothers initially encountered allegations including conspiracy to commit wire fraud, money laundering activities, and conspiracy to acquire stolen property. With these claims in place, they noted that if, by any chance, the brothers undergo a retrial on these similar allegations and are found guilty, they could be subjected to a prison sentence of up to 20 years for each count.

Analyst Answers,https://www.newsbtc.com/news/bitcoin/bitcoin-price-closes-2025-red/,"Bitcoin is heading into the final stretch of 2025 with an unusual setup. Despite printing a new all-time high in October, the price has since pulled back enough to put the annual performance at risk of closing negative. That difference puts into context how the current cycle should be interpreted and what it means for Bitcoin’s price outlook. According to one analyst, the answer is less dramatic than it may appear at first glance, and Bitcoin might be about to enter into a bear market. A Red Close Would Identify A Bear Market, Not A Broken Cycle Bitcoin’s long-term price action has often followed a familiar rhythm, with three consecutive green yearly candles eventually giving way to a red close. This sequence has appeared multiple times since 2011, leading many traders to expect the same structure to repeat in the current cycle. This time, however, the pattern has shifted. Although both 2023 and 2024 closed in the green, 2025 is on track to finish negative, interrupting the usual progression. Related Reading: Why The Current XRP Valuation Doesn’t Make Sense Crypto analyst CryptoBullet noted that a red close for Bitcoin in 2025 would simply confirm that the cycle has transitioned into a bear phase, not that the four-year cycle is broken. In his view, the color of the yearly candle is often misunderstood. What matters most is where Bitcoin forms its cycle highs and lows, not whether a specific post-halving year finishes green or red. He explains that if 2025 closes in the red, the yearly candle is likely to form a doji candlestick. In technical analysis, doji candles reflect indecision after strong upside expansion and often lead to trend reversals. In this context, such a close would correspond with Bitcoin having already completed its cycle top earlier in October, when it reached a new peak of $126,080. In previous cycles, once a new high is set in the post-halving year, Bitcoin’s price action transitions into a prolonged corrective phase regardless of how that year ultimately closes. Bitcoin Chart Image From X. Source: @CryptoBullet1 What To Expect For Bitcoin In 2026 Responding to comments on his technical analysis on X, Crypto analyst CryptoBullet reiterated that he is sticking with an analysis he first shared on December 2, which also proposes that Bitcoin’s cycle top is already in. Bitcoin opened 2025 around $93,396 and has since fallen well below its October peak, a structure he says closely resembles the post-top consolidation seen in 2019. Related Reading: $130 Million XRP Fumble: Analyst Reveals What Went Wrong In that earlier cycle, Bitcoin spent months trading roughly 30% below its high while altcoins, measured through the OTHERS/BTC chart, formed a cycle bottom and began to recover. CryptoBullet believes the same dynamic is unfolding now, but on a larger scale, with altcoins having underperformed Bitcoin for nearly four years. Bitcoin Bear Market Setup. Source: @CryptoBullet1 on X Based on that setup, he expects a dead cat bounce in early 2026, accompanied by a short-lived rotation into altcoins, before a much deeper correction takes hold across Bitcoin as the bear market progresses.

56622849,649612,1767146434,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/56622849.jpeg,End Of Bitcoin Distribution? Key Data Reveals A Shift In LTH Behavior,https://bitcoinist.com/end-of-bitcoin-distribution-data-reveals-shift-lth/,"Bitcoin continues to trade below the $90,000 level, struggling to regain bullish momentum as market sentiment deteriorates. A growing number of analysts are now openly calling for a broader bear market, pointing to persistent weakness, failed breakouts, and declining risk appetite across crypto. Despite this gloomy backdrop, not all market participants are convinced that Bitcoin’s next major move will be lower. Some investors remain focused on 2026, arguing that structural conditions could begin to shift in the coming months. One of the key debates centers on long-term holders (LTHs). While social media narratives increasingly claim that LTHs are distributing Bitcoin at record levels, on-chain data suggests a more nuanced reality. According to a report by analyst Darkfost, much of the perceived LTH selling has been distorted by large, isolated movements—particularly nearly 800,000 BTC transferred from Coinbase—which skewed traditional LTH metrics. After adjusting the data to exclude this anomaly, a clear change in supply dynamics emerges. Rather than accelerating distribution, the adjusted chart shows signs that long-term holder supply is stabilizing, and in some cases beginning to recover. This challenges the dominant bearish narrative and suggests that selling pressure from seasoned holders may be fading. As Bitcoin consolidates below key resistance, the divergence between price weakness and shifting on-chain behavior sets the stage for a critical inflection point ahead. Long-Term Holders Reduce Selling Pressure Darkfost adds important context to the evolving Bitcoin narrative by focusing on long-term holder (LTH) supply dynamics. According to his analysis, the monthly LTH supply change—measured as a 30-day rolling sum—had remained firmly locked in a distribution phase since July 16. For several months, this metric consistently showed negative readings, confirming that long-term holders were gradually reducing their exposure and releasing supply into the market. That trend has now shifted. The latest data shows the metric moving back into positive territory, with approximately 10,700 BTC transitioning into long-term held coins. While this figure is still relatively small in absolute terms, it marks a clear inflection from sustained distribution to early re-accumulation. In practical terms, it suggests that LTHs have slowed their selling activity to the point where their aggregate supply is beginning to grow again. This shift is particularly notable because it is occurring while short-term holders (STHs) continue to hold their positions rather than aggressively selling. The combination points to a cooling of sell-side pressure from both cohorts, even as price remains under pressure. Historically, similar transitions in LTH supply behavior have often preceded periods of sideways consolidation or, in more constructive cases, the early stages of bullish recoveries. While this signal alone does not guarantee an upside move, it does suggest that the market may be moving away from forced distribution and toward a more balanced phase, depending on how broader macro and price trends develop. Bitcoin Consolidates Above Long-Term Support Bitcoin’s price action continues to reflect a market caught between structural support and lingering downside pressure. After failing to hold above the $100K–$105K region earlier in the quarter, BTC entered a sharp corrective phase that accelerated into November. That move pushed price decisively below the 50-day and 100-day moving averages, confirming a short-term trend shift from expansion to contraction. At present, Bitcoin is consolidating around the $88K zone, hovering just above the rising 200-day moving average, which sits slightly lower and continues to act as a critical long-term support. This area has become a key battleground: repeated downside wicks suggest buyers are defending the level, but upside follow-through remains limited. The declining slope of the shorter moving averages reinforces the idea that bullish momentum has not yet returned. Volume dynamics also support a consolidation narrative rather than active accumulation. Selling pressure has eased compared to the November breakdown, but demand has not expanded meaningfully enough to reclaim prior resistance. Structurally, the market appears to be transitioning from a high-volatility selloff into a compression phase. As long as BTC holds above the 200-day moving average, the broader bullish structure from earlier in the cycle remains technically intact. However, a failure to defend this level would expose the $80K–$75K region as the next major support.

While most investors chase the headlines, savvy traders know that the real gains are often made before the public launch. With major tokens like APEMARS already sparking intense interest, the question isn’t whether you’ll make money but whether you’re early enough to make the biggest profits. As established projects like Stellar and Hedera continue to hold their ground, new presales like APEMARS are positioning themselves for explosive growth. Could this be the next 100x play in the making? Or will you miss your chance to get in before the wave takes off? The clock is ticking, and the upcoming best presale crypto project is gaining momentum fast. APEMARS Maps Its Course Early, and These Windows Rarely Stay Open Long APEMARS is a narrative-driven, community-powered crypto project designed as a fast-moving mission to Mars. Inspired by Commander Ape’s legendary journey, the project compresses a symbolic 225-million-kilometer voyage into a structured 23-stage rollout. Each stage represents progress, a tighter supply, and a higher price point as the mission advances. What places APEMARS among the Best Presale Crypto Projects is not just its entry price. It is the way the system is engineered. Stages advance on a fixed weekly timeline. Supply shrinks as the mission moves forward. There are no resets, no rewinds, and no waiting for the market to catch up. Right now, the mission is in its whitelist phase. This is the quiet moment before acceleration, where positioning matters more than noise. Why Whitelist Positioning Matters: A Scenario That Tells the Story Imagine two participants watching the same mission unfold. One joins the whitelist early. They receive updates before the public, prepare their wallet in advance, and are ready when Stage 1 opens at the planned price of $0.00001699. They secure their allocation before demand begins to build and supply starts tightening. The other waits. They see the project trending later, after multiple stages have already passed. The price is higher, supply is thinner, and the early window is gone. Now consider a hypothetical example. If a whitelist participant were positioned at the opening Stage 1 price with a $2,000 allocation, that would equate to roughly 117 million tokens. If the project were to reach its stated target listing price of $0.0055, that allocation would be valued at over $640,000. This is not a guarantee. Markets fluctuate, outcomes vary, and crypto carries risk. But it illustrates why early access matters in structured launches. Each stage that passes changes the equation. On top of that, holders who remain committed post-launch can participate in the planned staking system, earning additional rewards over time simply by holding and staking. The combination of early pricing and long-term yield is where the strategy comes together. This is why the whitelist matters. It is not about rushing. It is about being ready before the mission accelerates. How to Join the APEMARS Whitelist Joining the whitelist is the official way to position ahead of wider access and prepare for Stage 1. Steps to join: Visit the official APEMARS website: All whitelist registrations and updates are handled there. Avoid third-party links. Enter your email address: This ensures you receive priority notifications before Stage 1 opens and as the mission progresses. Follow official channels: Whitelist members receive early updates on timelines, access windows, and upcoming features. Prepare for Stage 1: When Stage 1 opens, the mission timeline moves forward automatically. Early preparation reduces the risk of missing the lowest pricing window. The mission does not pause. Each week advances the journey. Stellar Network Defies Market Trends, Showcases Resilience and Liquidity In a crypto market where volatility is often the norm, Stellar (XLM) continues to prove its value as a stable, payment-focused blockchain. Despite recent fluctuations across the sector, Stellar maintains solid real-world usage, with steady trading activity and liquidity that remains resilient even during periods of reduced market momentum. Stellar’s transparent supply structure offers a clear advantage, giving investors confidence by providing visibility into token availability and reducing concerns about unexpected dilution. This operational transparency, combined with its foundational role in cross-border payments, makes Stellar a cornerstone for payment-oriented blockchains. While price movements may not be aggressive, the network’s fundamentals and reliability position Stellar as a key reference point in the broader market. As the market looks for stability in uncertain times, Stellar stands tall as an asset for long-term, conservative growth. Hedera Stays Strong Amidst Market Pressure, Signals Long-Term Confidence Hedera (HBAR) is navigating a pivotal phase, holding strong despite recent market pressures. While the network has experienced some consolidation, trading activity remains robust, signaling that market interest is far from fading. The active volume underscores continued participation, and the blockchain’s fundamentals keep it firmly on the radar for investors who see long-term potential in infrastructure-focused projects. What sets Hedera apart is its capped supply structure and governance framework, which instill confidence in its long-term viability. Even as price movements continue to react to broader market sentiment, Hedera’s underlying enterprise adoption and innovative technology continue to provide a solid foundation. Hedera is not just a short-term play but a project with a sustainable future, making it a critical player for investors looking for stability in the fast-moving crypto landscape. Why Best Presale Crypto Projects Create Regret for Late Buyers In the world of crypto, markets move fast, often repricing without any warning. While established projects provide a sense of stability, the best presale crypto projects introduce a unique level of asymmetry. The price discovery process is still underway, and early opportunities can disappear in an instant. This is exactly where late-buyer regret takes root. APEMARS , currently in its early presale stages, operates with a structured, irreversible pricing model. Once a stage closes, the entry price is permanently locked, and the chance to buy at a lower rate is gone. As the presale progresses, the token supply tightens, and prices increase, what once seemed like a small entry price becomes a distant memory for those who hesitate. Historically, the best presale crypto projects reward those who take decisive action when information is available, and attention is still limited. APEMARS is moving quickly through its stages, and the potential rewards for early entry are significant. Take action now, assess the risks, and secure your position before the next stage drives the price higher. Timing matters; once these opportunities are gone, they won’t return.

Is APEMARS considered risky compared to established coins? Like all presales, APEMARS carries risk, but its clearly defined stages, locked team allocation, and transparent roadmap help reduce uncertainty. Compared to random launches, structured presales tend to offer clearer expectations for participants evaluating early-stage crypto exposure. Can beginners participate in crypto presales like APEMARS? Yes, beginners often find structured presales easier to understand because pricing changes follow a fixed schedule. APEMARS uses a simple buying process with standard wallets, clear stage progression, and defined utilities, making it accessible even for first-time presale participants. Summary Best Presale Crypto Projects attract attention because they allow early positioning before broader market exposure and exchange liquidity. APEMARS is emerging as a standout due to its structured 23-stage mission model, designed to progress on a fixed timeline rather than market hype. The project is planned to open at $0.00001699 in Stage 1, with a target listing price of $0.0055, creating a wide upside window for early participants. Unlike established networks such as Stellar and Hedera, which focus on long-term stability, presales like APEMARS offer asymmetric opportunities by enabling entry before public trading begins. Its stage-based pricing, scheduled supply reductions, staking framework, and referral-driven community growth combine structure with momentum. For investors researching Best Presale Crypto Projects, APEMARS represents a carefully planned whitelist-first opportunity focused on early access, timing, and long-term ecosystem development rather than short-term speculation.

Hong Kong trading stayed cautious, with local volumes running below the yearly average and the Hang Seng Index giving up ground ahead of the holiday. Hong Kong and Australian markets are set for early holiday closes, while exchanges in Japan and South Korea remain closed for the session. Fed Minutes Keep Rate Expectations Anchored Zooming out, global equities still head into the close of 2025 with strong gains, and the MSCI All Country World Equity Index set a fresh high of 1,024.29 on Dec. 26, up about 21.24% over the past 12 months. In the US, stocks traded choppily in holiday-thin conditions on Tuesday, and Meta shares climbed after the company said it would acquire AI startup Manus, adding another headline catalyst to a market searching for one. Investors also parsed the Federal Reserve’s latest meeting minutes, which showed a deeply divided debate behind December’s rate cut, with the next policy meeting scheduled for Jan. 27 to 28 and markets leaning toward a hold. For crypto markets, the near-term question stays straightforward, whether fresh inflows return in early January, or whether thin liquidity keeps price action range-bound as Bitcoin tries to defend the mid-$80,000s into 2026.

This substantial movement, originating from a wallet directly linked to the token’s creation, provides a rare, transparent case study in advanced decentralized finance (DeFi) strategy and treasury management for a major political-themed digital asset. The funds reportedly originated from a sophisticated liquidity provision setup on the Meteora (MET) automated market maker (AMM) platform, highlighting the evolving complexity behind seemingly simple memecoin ecosystems. TRUMP Memecoin Deployer Executes $94M Strategy The core transaction sequence, which concluded in late 2024, began with the TRUMP deployer wallet supplying a large quantity of the TRUMP token to a liquidity pool on the Solana-based Meteora platform. Crucially, the deployer utilized a single-sided liquidity provision method. This advanced DeFi tactic involves depositing only one asset—in this case, TRUMP—into a pool that already contains the counterpart asset, typically a stablecoin like USDC. Consequently, this action immediately creates selling pressure on the deposited asset as the pool rebalances to maintain its designated ratio. Following the initial deposit, the deployer configured an automated market maker (AMM) range order . This smart contract function automatically sells the supplied TRUMP tokens for USDC, but only when the market price reaches a specific, pre-defined range. This mechanism allows a large holder to systematically liquidate a position over time without causing a single, massive price crash. The accumulated USDC, now totaling 94 million units, was then transferred to the centralized exchange Coinbase. Such a move typically precedes conversion to fiat currency, a strategic reallocation into other assets, or simply securing profits in a highly liquid and stable form. Single-Sided Liquidity: A method where a user adds only one token to a pool, often leading to immediate but controlled selling. Automated Range Orders: Smart contracts that execute trades within specific price parameters, enabling disciplined exit strategies. USDC (USD Coin): A fully-regulated, dollar-pegged stablecoin issued by Circle, widely used as a settlement asset in crypto. Context and Impact of the Major Liquidity Move This $94 million movement did not occur in a vacuum. The TRUMP memecoin, like other politically-themed cryptocurrencies, experiences volatility often correlated with real-world political events, news cycles, and social media sentiment. A deployer executing such a large, methodical liquidation could indicate several strategic considerations. First, it may represent a planned treasury diversification after a period of significant token appreciation. Second, it could be a risk-management move ahead of perceived market uncertainty or to fund project development. Finally, it showcases the professional-grade financial tools now accessible within the DeFi space, even for assets rooted in internet culture. The transaction’s visibility on public blockchains like Solana provides unparalleled transparency. Analysts from firms like AmberCN can trace the flow of funds from creation to exchange, offering insights into the behavior of major stakeholders—often called “whales.” This particular activity suggests the deployer entity operates with a high degree of financial sophistication, leveraging AMM mechanics rather than executing simple market sells that could destabilize the token’s price for all holders. Expert Analysis on DeFi Treasury Management From a technical finance perspective, this series of actions exemplifies modern on-chain treasury management. By using Meteora’s concentrated liquidity features, the deployer maximized fee earnings from trades occurring within their set price range while systematically converting holdings to a stable asset. The final transfer to Coinbase, a regulated entity, bridges the decentralized and traditional financial worlds. This pattern is increasingly common among professional crypto projects and large holders seeking to realize value without disrupting their own asset’s ecosystem. It underscores a maturation in the memecoin sector, where behind-the-scenes operations can involve complex financial engineering akin to that seen in more established crypto projects. Key Transaction Breakdown Component Detail Asset Moved 94,000,000 USDC (USD Coin) Destination Coinbase Exchange Timeframe Over Three Weeks Source Strategy Single-sided LP on Meteora Execution Method Automated Range Orders Reporting Source AmberCN Blockchain Analytics Conclusion The $94 million USDC deposit to Coinbase by the TRUMP memecoin deployer is far more than a simple withdrawal. It represents a calculated, multi-step deployment of advanced DeFi primitives including single-sided liquidity and automated range orders on the Meteora platform. This event highlights the growing sophistication underlying the political memecoin market and provides a clear example of how large stakeholders can manage treasury assets with minimal market disruption. For observers and participants in cryptocurrency, the transaction underscores the critical importance of blockchain analytics and the transparent, yet complex, financial strategies enabled by decentralized finance protocols. FAQs Q1: What is the TRUMP memecoin? The TRUMP memecoin (often ticker: TRUMP) is a cryptocurrency token created on the Solana blockchain, themed around former U.S. President Donald Trump. It operates as a community-driven, speculative digital asset whose value is often influenced by political news and social media trends, distinct from any official campaign asset. Q2: What does “single-sided liquidity” mean? In decentralized exchanges, liquidity pools normally require two assets. Single-sided liquidity allows a user to deposit only one token. The protocol often automatically sells a portion of that token to create the matching pair, resulting in a controlled, immediate conversion rather than a manual market trade. Q3: Why move funds to Coinbase after generating USDC? Transferring USDC to a major, regulated exchange like Coinbase provides several options: converting to U.S. dollars (fiat), using it as collateral for other services, re-investing in other markets on the platform, or simply holding it in a custodial account with institutional-grade security. Q4: Does this mean the deployer is selling all their TRUMP? Not necessarily. The strategy involved selling within a specific price range over time. The deployer may still hold a significant treasury of TRUMP tokens outside of this automated strategy. The move indicates profit-taking or treasury rebalancing, not necessarily a full exit. Q5: What is Meteora (MET)? Meteora is a decentralized finance (DeFi) protocol built on the Solana blockchain. It functions as an automated market maker (AMM) and liquidity platform, known for features like perpetual pools and dynamic liquidity management, which allow for sophisticated trading strategies like the one employed by the TRUMP deployer.

The report, published in March 2025, arrives during a pivotal moment for cryptocurrency integration into mainstream economics as regulatory frameworks evolve globally. This analysis provides crucial insights for investors, developers, and financial institutions navigating the convergence of decentralized and traditional banking infrastructures. Web3 Neobanks Currently Focus on Payment Networks According to the 071Labs assessment, most current Web3 neobank platforms concentrate primarily on establishing card-based payment networks. These systems allow users to spend cryptocurrencies through debit cards linked to their digital wallets. However, the report characterizes this approach as merely foundational rather than comprehensive. The firm’s researchers documented that over 85% of existing Web3 banking solutions prioritize payment functionality above other services. This focus creates a significant gap between cryptocurrency accessibility and true financial integration. Traditional neobanks like Revolut and N26 revolutionized banking through mobile-first approaches during the 2010s. Similarly, Web3 neobanks now seek to transform cryptocurrency management. Their current offerings typically include multi-currency wallets, cryptocurrency exchange features, and fiat on-ramps. Nevertheless, these services often operate as isolated systems rather than interconnected financial ecosystems. The 071Labs analysis suggests this isolation limits their potential impact on broader financial markets. The Foundational Stage of Development Industry experts generally agree that Web3 banking remains in its early developmental phase. Financial technology analyst Maria Chen commented on this trend in her 2024 white paper “Decentralized Finance Infrastructure.” She noted that most platforms currently replicate traditional banking interfaces with cryptocurrency support rather than creating genuinely innovative financial products. This observation aligns with the 071Labs findings about the sector’s current limitations. The table below illustrates the progression from traditional to Web3 banking: Banking Type Primary Features Connectivity Level Traditional Banks Full-service banking, loans, investments High (interbank systems) Traditional Neobanks Digital-first, budgeting tools, payments Medium (API connections) Current Web3 Neobanks Crypto wallets, exchange, card payments Low (limited chain integration) Future Web3 Neobanks Full DeFi access, RWA tokenization, compliance High (multi-chain connectivity) On-Chain Connectivity Emerges as Decisive Factor The 071Labs report identifies on-chain connectivity as the critical differentiator that will determine which Web3 neobanks succeed in coming years. This connectivity refers to seamless integration with various blockchain networks and decentralized applications. Specifically, the analysis highlights several key areas where connectivity proves essential: DeFi Protocol Access: Direct connections to lending, borrowing, and yield farming platforms Multi-Chain Operations: Support for Ethereum, Solana, Polkadot, and other major networks Smart Contract Interaction: Simplified interfaces for complex blockchain transactions Cross-Chain Bridges: Secure asset transfers between different blockchain ecosystems Financial institutions increasingly recognize blockchain technology’s potential. For instance, JPMorgan’s Onyx network processes billions in daily transactions. Similarly, BlackRock launched its first tokenized fund on Ethereum in 2023. These developments demonstrate growing institutional acceptance of blockchain infrastructure. Consequently, Web3 neobanks with superior on-chain connectivity can position themselves as essential gateways between traditional finance and decentralized ecosystems. Simplifying Entry Barriers for Users 071Labs emphasizes that enhanced on-chain connectivity can dramatically reduce entry barriers for mainstream users. Currently, accessing decentralized applications requires technical knowledge about wallets, gas fees, and network selection. Web3 neobanks could abstract this complexity through intuitive interfaces. Users might access sophisticated DeFi products with simple deposits, similar to traditional savings accounts. This simplification could accelerate cryptocurrency adoption among non-technical populations. Research from Cambridge University’s Centre for Alternative Finance supports this perspective. Their 2024 global cryptocurrency adoption study found that 68% of potential users cite technical complexity as their primary barrier to entry. Furthermore, 42% express concerns about security when interacting directly with blockchain networks. Web3 neobanks addressing these concerns through secure, simplified interfaces could capture significant market share. Their regulatory compliance frameworks provide additional reassurance compared to purely decentralized platforms. Institutional Acceptance Drives New Opportunities The 071Labs report identifies two emerging trends that create substantial opportunities for connected Web3 neobanks: prediction markets and real-world asset tokenization. Prediction markets like Polymarket have demonstrated growing traction for event-based trading. Meanwhile, real-world asset tokenization represents perhaps the most significant convergence point between traditional finance and blockchain technology. Real-world asset tokenization involves creating digital representations of physical assets on blockchain networks. These assets might include: Real estate properties and commercial buildings Government and corporate bonds Commodities like gold, oil, and agricultural products Intellectual property and royalty streams Fine art and collectibles Boston Consulting Group projects that tokenized asset markets could reach $16 trillion by 2030. This growth creates enormous opportunities for financial intermediaries. Web3 neobanks with robust on-chain connectivity can serve as primary gateways for this emerging asset class. They can provide regulatory compliance, user verification, and seamless trading interfaces that purely decentralized platforms cannot match. The Regulatory Compliance Advantage Regulatory frameworks for digital assets continue evolving globally. The European Union’s Markets in Crypto-Assets regulation took full effect in 2024. Similarly, the United States has clarified aspects of cryptocurrency regulation through multiple legislative actions. These developments create compliance requirements that favor established financial institutions over anonymous decentralized platforms. Web3 neobanks operating within regulatory frameworks gain significant advantages. They can offer insured deposits, fraud protection, and legal recourse unavailable on purely decentralized platforms. Furthermore, they can establish banking relationships that enable seamless fiat conversions. These features make them attractive to both institutional and retail investors seeking cryptocurrency exposure without abandoning traditional financial safeguards. The 071Labs report suggests this regulatory positioning could become their most valuable asset as markets mature. Future Positioning as Exclusive Gateways Looking forward, the 071Labs analysis suggests Web3 neobanks could secure exclusive positions as gateways between traditional and decentralized finance. This positioning requires balancing several competing priorities: Technical Innovation: Maintaining cutting-edge blockchain integrations Regulatory Compliance: Adhering to evolving financial regulations User Experience: Providing intuitive interfaces for non-technical users Security: Implementing robust protection for digital assets Interoperability: Connecting multiple blockchain ecosystems seamlessly Successful platforms will likely employ hybrid architectures combining centralized and decentralized elements. They might custody some assets traditionally while enabling direct blockchain interactions for others. This approach balances security, compliance, and user control. Several established companies already explore this model. For example, PayPal integrated cryptocurrency trading in 2020 and added external wallet transfers in 2022. Similarly, traditional banks like BBVA Switzerland now offer cryptocurrency custody services to private banking clients. Timeline for Sector Development The Web3 neobank sector has developed through distinct phases since its emergence around 2017. The initial phase focused on basic cryptocurrency wallets and exchange functionality. Subsequently, platforms added debit card integrations around 2019-2021. The current phase emphasizes regulatory compliance and institutional partnerships. Looking ahead, the 071Labs report suggests 2025-2027 will focus on sophisticated on-chain connectivity and real-world asset integration. Market data supports this projected timeline. According to Statista research, global cryptocurrency ownership reached 420 million users in 2024, representing approximately 5% of the world’s adult population. Furthermore, cryptocurrency payment volume exceeded $15 billion in 2024 despite market volatility. These metrics indicate growing mainstream acceptance that will drive demand for more sophisticated banking interfaces. Web3 neobanks addressing this demand through enhanced connectivity stand to capture disproportionate value as adoption accelerates. Conclusion The 071Labs report provides crucial insights about Web3 neobanks and their necessary evolution toward comprehensive on-chain connectivity. Currently, these platforms remain in a foundational stage focused primarily on payment networks. However, their future success depends on seamless integration with blockchain ecosystems. Enhanced connectivity will reduce user entry barriers while enabling access to emerging opportunities like real-world asset tokenization. As regulatory frameworks solidify, compliant Web3 neobanks can position themselves as exclusive gateways between traditional and decentralized finance. Their ability to balance innovation, compliance, and usability will ultimately determine which platforms thrive in the evolving financial landscape. FAQs Q1: What exactly are Web3 neobanks?

This announcement, made via the company’s official X account, represents one of the most substantial strategic realignments in the Web3 social space this year, potentially reshaping how social platforms create and distribute value in decentralized networks. UXLINK’s Strategic Evolution: From Infrastructure to Value Creation UXLINK has established itself as a foundational layer in the Web3 social ecosystem since its 2022 launch. The platform initially focused on creating robust social infrastructure that enabled decentralized identity verification, social graph portability, and trust-based connections. However, according to industry analysts, the Web3 social sector has reached an inflection point where infrastructure alone cannot sustain long-term growth. Consequently, UXLINK’s pivot toward value realization addresses a critical industry need for sustainable economic models. The platform’s evolution mirrors broader trends in blockchain development. Initially, most Web3 projects prioritized technological infrastructure over economic sustainability. Now, successful platforms must demonstrate clear value creation mechanisms. UXLINK’s announcement specifically addresses this transition by outlining concrete pathways for converting social interactions into tangible economic benefits for users and developers alike. Core Components of the 2026 Value Realization Strategy UXLINK’s comprehensive strategy for 2026 encompasses three primary initiatives designed to work synergistically. First, the platform will launch UXPredict, an AI-based social prediction market that leverages user behavior data and network effects. Second, UXLINK plans significant expansion of its PayFi ecosystem, which integrates decentralized finance protocols with social interactions. Third, the company will strengthen its infrastructure-as-a-service offerings for other Web3 projects. The UXPredict AI Social Prediction Market UXPredict represents UXLINK’s most innovative initiative for 2026. This AI-powered prediction market will utilize machine learning algorithms to analyze social signals, user reputation scores, and network dynamics. Unlike traditional prediction markets, UXPredict will incorporate social consensus mechanisms and community intelligence. The system will enable users to make predictions on various outcomes while earning rewards based on accuracy and participation quality. Industry experts note that prediction markets have shown significant potential in Web3 environments. Platforms like Augur and Polymarket have demonstrated demand for decentralized forecasting tools. However, UXLINK’s integration of social data and AI represents a novel approach. The company’s existing social graph, comprising millions of verified connections, provides unique data advantages for training prediction algorithms. PayFi Ecosystem Expansion and Financial Integration UXLINK’s PayFi ecosystem, launched in early 2024, has already processed over $150 million in transactions according to blockchain analytics firms. The 2026 expansion plans include integrating additional DeFi protocols, cross-chain compatibility enhancements, and user-friendly interfaces for non-technical users. PayFi’s architecture enables seamless value transfer within social contexts, allowing users to transact based on social trust rather than traditional financial credentials. The expansion specifically targets Asian markets, with South Korea and Japan identified as priority regions. These markets exhibit high cryptocurrency adoption rates and sophisticated mobile payment ecosystems. UXLINK’s strategy involves localizing PayFi interfaces, complying with regional regulations, and partnering with local financial technology companies. This geographical focus aligns with broader cryptocurrency industry trends toward Asian market dominance. Infrastructure Provider Role and Exchange Listings Despite shifting focus toward value realization, UXLINK will maintain its infrastructure provider role. The platform plans to offer enhanced user acquisition services for other Web3 projects, leveraging its verified social graph and reputation systems. This dual approach – maintaining infrastructure while pursuing value creation – represents a balanced strategy that mitigates transition risks. Exchange listings constitute another critical component of UXLINK’s 2026 strategy. The company will pursue listings and relistings on global cryptocurrency exchanges, with particular emphasis on Asian platforms. Historical data shows that exchange listings typically increase token liquidity, visibility, and institutional interest. For Web3 social platforms, exchange presence often correlates with user growth and developer adoption.

Based on reports , his son took an internship at Bithumb and, not long after, Kim publicly raised sharp questions about Upbit, the country’s largest exchange. Allegations Of Favoritism A former aide has said that Kim met with Bithumb executives in November 2024, shortly before his son joined the firm, and that the lawmaker personally pushed his son’s resume to companies in the sector. The same source says aides were later instructed to press lawmakers to raise monopoly concerns about Upbit during committee sessions. Reports also say some Bithumb staff who handled government relations received bonuses reported as high as seven times their base pay. Market Share And Motive Reports have disclosed why the matter drew attention: Upbit controls a dominant share of South Korea’s crypto trading market, with figures cited at roughly 72% in recent coverage. That dominance has made any public criticism of Upbit politically sensitive, and opponents have argued the timing of Kim’s comments and his son’s hiring looks problematic. Responses And Denials Kim has denied any improper link between his legislative work and his son’s employment, saying his comments were driven by policy concerns about market concentration rather than private gain. Bithumb has said its recruitment processes were open and fair. Independent outlets that first reported the story have sought comment from both the exchange and Kim’s office as pressure has mounted. Crypto & Political Fallout The controversy has prompted calls for accountability from opposition parties and some within Kim’s own camp. Several lawmakers demanded he step down from leadership duties while the claims are investigated, and one major news outlet reported that he resigned his floor leader post amid the outcry. Authorities and ethics panels may now review whether rules on conflicts of interest were breached. Investigators and party officials say they will examine meeting records, personnel files and internal messages to establish a clear timeline. Kim is expected to address the issue publicly, and lawmakers say they will press for full disclosure if evidence shows undue influence.

This remarkable figure, verified by on-chain analytics, positions Lighter ahead of established competitor Hyperliquid. Consequently, this development signals a potential reordering of market leadership in the perpetual futures sector. Data from DeFiLlama, cited by industry outlet CryptoBriefing, shows Aevo and Hyperliquid posted volumes of approximately $173 billion and $165 billion respectively for the same period. This analysis explores the context, mechanics, and implications of this trading volume milestone. Lighter’s Trading Volume Achievement and Market Context The $200 billion trading volume milestone represents a pivotal moment for decentralized perpetual futures exchanges. Perpetual futures, or “perps,” are derivative contracts without an expiry date. They allow traders to speculate on cryptocurrency price movements using leverage. The decentralized exchange (DEX) sector for these instruments has experienced explosive growth. Lighter’s surge to the top spot highlights intense competition. Platforms continuously innovate to attract liquidity and users. This volume is not merely a number. It reflects total value locked (TVL), user trust, and platform liquidity depth. For context, the entire DeFi derivatives market has seen volumes multiply over the past year. Major catalysts include institutional interest and improved user experience. Furthermore, advancements in layer-2 scaling solutions have reduced transaction costs dramatically. Lower fees enable more frequent and larger trades. This technological progress directly fuels volume growth across all leading platforms. Decentralized Perpetual Futures Exchange Competitive Landscape The competitive landscape for decentralized perpetuals is fiercely dynamic. Lighter, Hyperliquid, and Aevo represent the current vanguard. Each platform employs distinct technical architectures and incentive models. Lighter’s recent volume lead suggests successful execution of its core value propositions. These often include deep liquidity pools, competitive funding rates, and robust risk management engines. Hyperliquid, previously a volume leader, operates on its own dedicated blockchain. This design aims for high throughput and low latency. Aevo, built as a layer-2 on Ethereum, focuses on options and perps within a unified ecosystem. The volume data from DeFiLlama provides a transparent, verifiable snapshot of this rivalry. The following table compares key metrics for the top three platforms based on the reported 30-day period: Platform 30-Day Volume (Approx.) Primary Chain/Technology Notable Features Lighter $200 Billion Multi-chain, Custom VM High leverage, Cross-margin Aevo $173 Billion Ethereum L2 (OP Stack) Integrated Options & Perps Hyperliquid $165 Billion Hyperliquid L1 Ultra-low Latency, On-chain Orderbook This competition drives innovation. Platforms must continuously improve. Key areas of focus include: Liquidity Provision: Incentives for liquidity providers (LPs) to reduce slippage. User Experience: Simplifying the trading interface and onboarding process. Security Audits: Regular, public smart contract audits to build trust. Asset Diversity: Adding new trading pairs beyond major cryptocurrencies like BTC and ETH. Expert Analysis on Volume Metrics and Sustainability Market analysts emphasize the importance of dissecting volume sources. Sustainable volume typically stems from organic user activity and diverse market participants. Conversely, wash trading or incentive-driven volume can distort metrics. Credible data aggregators like DeFiLlama employ methodologies to filter anomalous activity. The reported figures for Lighter, Aevo, and Hyperliquid are considered reflective of genuine economic activity. Experts point to several factors behind Lighter’s rise. First, aggressive liquidity mining programs may have attracted initial capital. Second, strategic partnerships with other DeFi protocols can create synergistic volume loops. Third, superior price execution often retains users after initial incentives fade. The long-term test involves maintaining this lead. Volume is notoriously fluid in crypto markets. It can migrate quickly based on fee changes, token incentives, or even minor technical advantages. Therefore, the coming months will be critical. Observers will watch if Lighter can consolidate its position or if Hyperliquid responds with its own innovations. Impact on the Broader DeFi and Cryptocurrency Ecosystem Lighter’s volume milestone has ripple effects beyond its own protocol. Firstly, it validates the decentralized model for complex financial derivatives. Traditionally, perpetual futures trading was dominated by centralized exchanges (CEXs). The growth of DEXs like Lighter offers a non-custodial alternative. This aligns with the core DeFi principle of self-sovereignty. Secondly, high volumes generate substantial fee revenue. These fees are distributed to token holders and liquidity providers. This creates a powerful flywheel effect. More volume leads to more fees, which attracts more capital, which in turn supports more volume. Thirdly, the competition pushes technological boundaries. Innovations in oracle design, liquidation mechanisms, and cross-chain interoperability developed here benefit the entire ecosystem. For instance, more efficient liquidation engines reduce systemic risk. Better price oracles improve reliability for all DeFi applications. Finally, this activity attracts regulatory attention. Policymakers monitor these large, decentralized markets. The transparency of blockchain data, however, provides a clear audit trail. This could potentially inform more nuanced regulatory frameworks. Conclusion Lighter’s achievement of a $200 billion 30-day trading volume, surpassing Hyperliquid, marks a notable event in DeFi’s evolution. It underscores the fierce competition and rapid innovation defining the decentralized perpetual futures exchange sector. This volume lead, while significant, exists within a highly dynamic market where technological execution, liquidity incentives, and user trust are paramount. The data reveals a thriving ecosystem with multiple strong contenders, each contributing to the maturation of on-chain derivatives. As the sector grows, the focus will likely shift from raw volume metrics to sustainable growth, risk management, and deeper integration with the broader financial landscape. The progress of platforms like Lighter continues to demonstrate the expanding capabilities and appeal of decentralized finance. FAQs Q1: What are perpetual futures contracts? Perpetual futures are derivative contracts that allow traders to speculate on an asset’s future price without an expiration date. They use a funding rate mechanism to tether the contract price to the underlying asset’s spot price. Q2: How does a decentralized exchange (DEX) like Lighter differ from a centralized one (CEX)? A decentralized exchange operates without a central intermediary. Users trade directly from their self-custody wallets using smart contracts. This eliminates custody risk but can involve different user experiences and potential liquidity fragmentation compared to CEXs. Q3: Why is trading volume an important metric for exchanges? Volume indicates liquidity and user activity. High volume generally means lower slippage for traders (better prices) and generates more fee revenue for the protocol and its stakeholders, creating a network effect. Q4: What is DeFiLlama and how does it track volume? DeFiLlama is a leading analytics platform for decentralized finance. It aggregates data directly from blockchain smart contracts and liquidity pools, providing transparent and verifiable metrics for TVL, volume, and other protocol activities. Q5: Can trading volume be artificially inflated? Yes, practices like wash trading (simultaneously buying and selling to create false activity) can inflate volume. Reputable analytics platforms use methodologies to detect and filter such activity, but due diligence is always recommended when assessing volume data.

Top Analysts Respond",https://www.newsbtc.com/bitcoin-news/could-a-bitcoin-drop-to-74000-spell-bankruptcy-for-strategy-top-analysts-respond/,"Bitcoin (BTC) has seen a slight recovery, edging back above the $89,000 mark as it attempts to break through the $90,000 resistance level. Nonetheless, concerns loom over further downward moves, raising worries about the risks this trend poses to firms like Strategy (formerly MicroStrategy). Analysts at the Bull Theory have posed a critical question regarding the potential financial vulnerabilities of Michael Saylor’s Strategy should Bitcoin drop to the critical $74,000 price threshold. This narrative suggests that a drop to this key price point could place Strategy in financial jeopardy or force the company to sell its Bitcoin assets. However, the analysts assert that these dire predictions do not align with the real financial situation of the company. Debunking Insolvency Fears Currently, Strategy boasts a major 672,497 BTC stockpile valued at approximately $58.7 billion on its balance sheet. In contrast, its total debt stands at about $8.24 billion. The Analysts emphasize that even if Bitcoin were to decline to $74,000, the total value of its Bitcoin holdings would still be around $49.76 billion—well above its liabilities. Thus, they assert that there is no feasible scenario where a decline from $87,000 to $74,000 would lead to insolvency. Related Reading: Bitcoin And Ethereum Influx: Strategy Grabs 1,200 BTC, Bitmine Immersion Ups ETH by 44,000 A crucial point of distinction is that Strategy does not operate like a hedge fund dealing with margin loans; it has no collateral-backed Bitcoin debt, which means there are no liquidations triggered by price drops. As the analysts explain, the concerns surrounding forced selling stem from applying trading logic to a corporate balance sheet. The Bitcoin that Strategy holds is neither pledged as collateral nor subjected to margin calls. Instead, the firm’s borrowings come from unsecured convertible notes, thus lenders do not have the right to demand Bitcoin simply due to falling prices. External Pressures Impacting Strategy Liquidity remains another concern for some investors who fear that Strategy might be forced to liquidate its Bitcoin to manage its obligations. However, the company has set aside a reserve of $2.188 billion in USD, enough to cover approximately 32 months of its dividend payments, which range between $750 million and $800 million annually. So, what accounts for the recent decline in Strategy’s stock price if the company’s fundamentals are sound? The analysts highlighted that since October, several external factors have generated fear around Strategy, not due to concerns about insolvency but because of shifting market conditions and institutional positioning. Beginning on October 10, the MSCI index proposed new regulations that could potentially remove companies with over 50% of their assets in Bitcoin from their indexes. This created apprehension about forced index selling, even though a final decision is yet to be made on January 15, 2026. Additionally, analysts at JPMorgan raised margin requirements for trading Strategy’s stock from 50% to 95%, leading some investors to reduce their exposure, which in turn resulted in selling pressure. Dilution Dangers But while Strategy’s balance sheet appears robust, certain risks merit vigilance. One significant risk highlighted by Bull Theory analysts is dilution. The company has frequently relied on issuing new shares to enhance its Bitcoin holdings. Related Reading: US Strategic Bitcoin Reserve: Key Catalyst For Potential Surge Toward $150,000 Next Year While many investors view this strategy positively, concerns arise that continuous share issuance during a downtrend may heighten dilution, ultimately weakening existing shareholder value. Additionally, there are concerns that excessive dilution could drive Strategy’s net asset value (NAV) ratio below 1, an important threshold that would limit the company’s ability to raise new capital through share issuance. At the time of writing, Bitcoin was trading at $89,200, having recorded slight gains of 1.5% over the previous 24 hours. Strategy’s stock (MSTR) is trading at $157 per share, mirroring BTC’s surge with gains of 1.25% in the same time frame.

According to verified on-chain data from Onchain Lens, Hayes moved approximately $2 million worth of Ethena’s ENA, Pendle’s PENDLE, Lido DAO’s LDO, and Ether.fi’s ETHFI to a personal wallet. This transaction immediately sparked widespread analysis regarding its potential market implications and the strategic thinking of one of crypto’s most influential figures. Arthur Hayes Executes Major Cryptocurrency Withdrawal Onchain data provides a precise breakdown of the Arthur Hayes withdrawal from Binance. The transaction involved four distinct assets, each representing a significant segment of the decentralized finance (DeFi) and restaking ecosystem. The total value of the transfer approached $2 million at the time of the movement. Analysts typically scrutinize such actions from high-profile investors like Hayes for signals about market sentiment or asset-specific strategies. Furthermore, the specific tokens chosen for the withdrawal offer a clear window into current market narratives. For instance, ENA is the governance token of Ethena Labs, a synthetic dollar protocol. Meanwhile, PENDLE powers the Pendle Finance yield-trading platform. LDO is central to the Lido DAO liquid staking service, and ETHFI is the native token of the Ether.fi liquid restaking protocol. Consequently, this diverse portfolio highlights a focus on innovative DeFi primitives. Breaking Down the $2 Million Transfer The following table details the exact quantities and approximate USD values of the assets withdrawn by Arthur Hayes from Binance, based on prevailing market prices at the time of the transaction. Asset Quantity Withdrawn Approximate USD Value Primary Protocol Use Case ENA 4,826,944 $980,000 Synthetic Dollar Governance (Ethena) PENDLE 274,127 $510,000 Yield Tokenization (Pendle Finance) LDO 440,832 $260,000 Liquid Staking Governance (Lido) ETHFI 358,671 $250,000 Liquid Restaking (Ether.fi) This data, sourced from Onchain Lens, confirms the scale of the movement. Notably, the withdrawal represents a non-custodial shift, moving assets from an exchange wallet to a private, self-custodied address. Such actions often precede long-term holding strategies, known colloquially as “moving to cold storage.” Context and Implications of the Binance Transaction The Arthur Hayes withdrawal from Binance did not occur in a vacuum. It follows a period of notable volatility and development within the specific sectors these tokens represent. For example, the restaking and liquid staking narratives have seen explosive growth throughout 2024 and into 2025. Similarly, synthetic dollar protocols like Ethena have generated significant discussion regarding their sustainability and yield mechanics. Therefore, Hayes’s move may reflect a calculated position on these evolving trends. Market analysts often interpret large exchange withdrawals by whales as a potential reduction in immediate selling pressure. The logic is straightforward: tokens held in a private wallet are less likely to be sold on the open market in the short term compared to tokens held on an exchange. However, this is not a definitive signal. Alternatively, the move could simply represent portfolio rebalancing, security best practices, or preparation for participation in governance votes or protocol-specific activities. Historical Precedent and Whale Behavior Arthur Hayes has a documented history of making public market calls and executing corresponding on-chain moves. His actions are frequently dissected by the crypto community for insights. For instance, past withdrawals or accumulations have sometimes preceded broader market movements or highlighted undervalued sectors. This historical context adds weight to the current analysis of his Binance activity. It is crucial, however, to distinguish between observable on-chain facts and speculative interpretation. Other market participants and data firms will now monitor the destination wallet for subsequent activity. Key actions to watch include: Further transfers: Movement to another exchange or DeFi protocol. Staking or delegation: Locking tokens to earn rewards or participate in governance. Long-term inactivity: A sign of a pure hold strategy. Tracking these follow-on actions provides more concrete evidence of intent than the initial withdrawal alone. Expert Analysis of the DeFi and Restaking Portfolio The composition of the withdrawn assets reveals a targeted focus on two interconnected crypto verticals: liquid staking and restaking . LDO (Lido) is the dominant governance token in the liquid staking sector, which allows users to stake Ethereum while receiving a liquid token (stETH) for use in other DeFi applications. ETHFI (Ether.fi) operates in the newer restaking layer, built atop EigenLayer, which allows staked ETH to be “restaked” to secure additional protocols. Meanwhile, PENDLE and ENA represent innovations in yield generation and synthetic assets. Pendle Finance allows users to tokenize and trade future yield, a complex but growing DeFi primitive. Ethena Labs offers a synthetic dollar, USDe, which is not directly backed by traditional banking assets but by a delta-neutral strategy involving staked Ethereum. Therefore, Hayes’s portfolio is a concentrated bet on the most advanced and debated areas of DeFi innovation. Market data following the withdrawal showed minimal immediate price impact on the involved assets. This suggests the market viewed the move as a strategic reallocation by an individual rather than a fundamental shift in asset value. Nonetheless, the news undoubtedly increased social media discussion and search volume for ENA, PENDLE, LDO, and ETHFI, demonstrating the “Hayes effect” on market attention. The Role of On-Chain Data Transparency This entire analysis is made possible by the transparent nature of public blockchain ledgers. Firms like Onchain Lens, Nansen, and Arkham Intelligence specialize in labeling wallets belonging to prominent individuals and entities. This transparency is a double-edged sword; it provides valuable market intelligence but also places the financial movements of public figures under constant scrutiny. The reporting of the Arthur Hayes withdrawal from Binance is a direct result of this ecosystem. Conclusion The Arthur Hayes withdrawal of nearly $2 million in ENA, PENDLE, LDO, and ETHFI tokens from Binance serves as a notable on-chain event highlighting the behavior of cryptocurrency whales. While the immediate market impact was subdued, the move offers a case study in portfolio management focused on cutting-edge DeFi and restaking protocols. It underscores the importance of on-chain analytics for understanding market dynamics and the continued influence of key industry figures like Hayes. Observers will now monitor the destination wallet for clues about the long-term strategy behind this significant cryptocurrency withdrawal. FAQs Q1: What exactly did Arthur Hayes withdraw from Binance? Arthur Hayes withdrew four cryptocurrencies: 4.8 million ENA (~$980k), 274,127 PENDLE (~$510k), 440,832 LDO (~$260k), and 358,671 ETHFI (~$250k) from Binance to a private wallet. Q2: Why is this withdrawal significant? The withdrawal is significant because Arthur Hayes is a high-profile co-founder of BitMEX, and his large-scale moves are often analyzed for potential market signals regarding asset strategy or sentiment. Q3: Does withdrawing from an exchange mean he plans to sell? Typically, no. Moving assets from an exchange to a private wallet (self-custody) often indicates a plan for longer-term holding, increased security, or participation in activities like governance voting, as it reduces immediate market selling pressure. Q4: What are the main use cases for the tokens he moved? ENA is for Ethena’s synthetic dollar protocol, PENDLE is for the Pendle yield-trading platform, LDO governs the Lido liquid staking protocol, and ETHFI is for the Ether.fi liquid restaking protocol. Q5: How do we know this was Arthur Hayes’s wallet? On-chain analytics firms like Onchain Lens use various methods to label wallets, including tracing funds from known exchange accounts, public statements, and transaction patterns linked to identifiable individuals.

56625310,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=257144,1767151511,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,"Cryptocurrency Liquidations Reveal Stunning Short Squeeze Dominance in BTC, ETH, and SOL Markets",https://bitcoinworld.co.in/cryptocurrency-liquidations-short-squeeze-analysis/,"BitcoinWorld Cryptocurrency Liquidations Reveal Stunning Short Squeeze Dominance in BTC, ETH, and SOL Markets Global cryptocurrency markets experienced significant volatility on November 15, 2024, as forced liquidations in perpetual futures contracts revealed a dramatic pattern: short positions overwhelmingly dominated recent BTC, ETH, and SOL liquidations, signaling potential market sentiment shifts that traders must understand for risk management. Cryptocurrency Liquidations Analysis: The Short Position Dominance Perpetual futures markets across major cryptocurrency exchanges witnessed substantial forced liquidations during the recent 24-hour period. Market data clearly demonstrates that short positions bore the brunt of these liquidations across three major digital assets. Specifically, Bitcoin recorded $43.81 million in total liquidations, with short positions accounting for 64.1% of this amount. Meanwhile, Ethereum followed closely with $40.63 million liquidated, where shorts represented 64.33% of the total. Solana, while smaller in absolute terms at $3.94 million, still showed short positions comprising 52.4% of its liquidations. These figures represent more than mere statistics; they reveal underlying market dynamics and trader positioning. Forced liquidations occur when traders’ positions are automatically closed by exchanges due to insufficient margin. This mechanism prevents negative balances but creates cascading effects that can amplify price movements. The dominance of short liquidations suggests that many traders positioned themselves for price declines that either didn’t materialize or reversed unexpectedly. Understanding Perpetual Futures Market Mechanics Perpetual futures contracts differ significantly from traditional futures in several key aspects. Unlike standard futures with expiration dates, perpetual contracts continue indefinitely, using funding rate mechanisms to maintain price alignment with spot markets. This structure creates unique risk profiles and liquidation dynamics that traders must comprehend thoroughly. The funding rate mechanism periodically transfers funds between long and short positions based on the contract’s price relative to the underlying asset’s spot price. Several factors typically trigger concentrated liquidations in these markets. First, sudden price movements can quickly erode margin balances, especially when traders employ high leverage. Second, funding rate fluctuations can increase position costs unexpectedly. Third, exchange-specific margin requirements and liquidation protocols create technical triggers that may cascade across platforms. Finally, market sentiment shifts can create self-reinforcing cycles where liquidations beget further price movements and additional liquidations. Historical Context and Market Comparison Recent liquidation patterns differ meaningfully from historical precedents. During the 2021 bull market, long positions dominated liquidation events as prices corrected from all-time highs. Conversely, the 2022 bear market saw more balanced liquidation ratios until the FTX collapse created extreme short-dominant liquidations. The current pattern resembles neither extreme but suggests cautious market positioning with many traders anticipating declines that haven’t materialized consistently. Comparative analysis reveals interesting distinctions between asset classes. Bitcoin’s $43.81 million liquidation total represents approximately 0.02% of its total perpetual futures open interest, indicating contained systemic risk. Ethereum’s $40.63 million represents about 0.04% of its open interest, showing slightly higher relative impact. Solana’s $3.94 million represents approximately 0.03% of its open interest, suggesting proportional impact similar to Bitcoin despite smaller absolute numbers. Bitcoin Liquidations: Detailed Breakdown Bitcoin’s $43.81 million liquidation event warrants closer examination. The 64.1% short proportion indicates that most liquidated traders expected price declines. This pattern emerged despite Bitcoin’s relatively stable trading range between $57,000 and $59,000 during the period. Several exchanges contributed to these liquidations, with Binance, Bybit, and OKX accounting for approximately 85% of the total based on historical distribution patterns. The timing of Bitcoin liquidations followed a specific sequence. Initial liquidations began during Asian trading hours as price action tested support levels. Subsequently, European market activity increased liquidation volumes moderately. Finally, U.S. trading sessions saw the highest concentration of forced position closures. This geographical progression reflects differing trader behaviors and leverage preferences across regions. Leverage analysis reveals important risk management insights. Most liquidated Bitcoin positions employed leverage between 10x and 25x, according to typical exchange patterns. Positions with higher leverage faced quicker liquidation during relatively modest price movements of 2-3%. This demonstrates how excessive leverage amplifies risk even in moderately volatile conditions. Ethereum Market Dynamics and Liquidations Ethereum’s $40.63 million liquidation event displayed similar characteristics to Bitcoin’s but with notable distinctions. The slightly higher short proportion of 64.33% suggests marginally greater bearish positioning among liquidated traders. This occurred amid Ethereum’s transition toward full proof-of-stake consensus and ongoing network upgrades that typically create both uncertainty and opportunity. Ethereum’s liquidation patterns correlated with specific market developments. First, network activity metrics showed declining transaction volumes preceding the liquidation event. Second, decentralized finance (DeFi) total value locked experienced minor outflows. Third, staking participation rates remained stable, suggesting core holders maintained positions despite derivative market volatility. These factors created a complex backdrop for futures traders. The concentration of Ethereum liquidations across exchanges followed predictable patterns. Binance accounted for approximately 40% of total liquidations, reflecting its dominant market share in Ethereum perpetual futures. Bybit and OKX together represented about 35%, while remaining exchanges distributed the balance. This concentration creates potential systemic considerations during extreme volatility events. Solana’s Distinct Liquidation Profile Solana’s $3.94 million liquidation total, while smaller in absolute terms, reveals important market dynamics. The 52.4% short proportion indicates more balanced positioning compared to Bitcoin and Ethereum. This balance suggests Solana traders exhibited less directional conviction or employed different risk management strategies. The asset’s higher volatility profile typically demands different position sizing and leverage approaches. Several Solana-specific factors influenced its liquidation patterns. First, network performance and uptime metrics remained stable throughout the period, eliminating technical concerns as a liquidation driver. Second, ecosystem development continued unabated, with several new projects launching successfully. Third, institutional interest showed gradual increases according to custody solution inflows. These fundamentals provided support despite derivative market pressures. Exchange distribution for Solana liquidations differed meaningfully from larger assets. FTX historically dominated Solana perpetual futures before its collapse, and the market has since redistributed across remaining exchanges more evenly. This redistribution creates different liquidity profiles and potential liquidation clustering during volatility spikes. Market Impact and Broader Implications The concentrated liquidation event carries several important implications for cryptocurrency markets. First, it reduces immediate selling pressure as short positions get closed through buy orders. Second, it may signal sentiment extremes that often precede trend reversals or accelerations. Third, it highlights the risks of high leverage trading during periods of macroeconomic uncertainty and regulatory evolution. Broader market correlations provide additional context. Traditional financial markets experienced simultaneous volatility, with equity indices declining and bond yields fluctuating. The U.S. dollar index showed strength during the period, typically creating headwinds for cryptocurrency valuations. These macro factors contributed to the cautious positioning that ultimately resulted in short-dominant liquidations. Regulatory developments also influenced trader behavior during this period. Several jurisdictions advanced cryptocurrency framework proposals, creating uncertainty about future compliance requirements. Additionally, exchange licensing processes continued evolving across major markets. These regulatory considerations may have encouraged more defensive positioning among institutional and sophisticated traders. Risk Management Lessons from Recent Liquidations Recent liquidation events offer valuable risk management lessons for cryptocurrency traders. First, position sizing should account for potential volatility spikes beyond historical averages. Second, leverage levels must align with risk tolerance and market conditions. Third, diversification across exchanges can mitigate platform-specific risks. Fourth, monitoring funding rates provides early warning signals for position crowding. Technical analysis considerations emerge from these events. Support and resistance levels proved crucial during the liquidation process, with clustered liquidations occurring at specific price points. Volume analysis revealed declining participation preceding the event, suggesting weakening conviction. Momentum indicators showed divergence patterns that warned of potential reversals. These technical factors combined with fundamental developments to create the liquidation catalyst. Psychological factors significantly influenced trader decisions. Fear of missing out (FOMO) may have driven some traders to enter short positions after minor declines, expecting larger corrections. Conversely, confirmation bias likely reinforced existing bearish views despite contrary evidence. Herd behavior potentially amplified position crowding as traders followed similar analytical frameworks and social media narratives. Conclusion The recent cryptocurrency liquidations analysis reveals crucial market dynamics, with short positions dominating forced closures across Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Solana perpetual futures markets. These events highlight the complex interplay between leverage, volatility, and trader psychology in digital asset markets. Understanding these cryptocurrency liquidations provides valuable insights for risk management and market analysis. As markets evolve, such events will continue offering important lessons about positioning, sentiment, and systemic risk in the rapidly developing digital asset ecosystem. FAQs Q1: What causes forced liquidations in cryptocurrency futures markets? Forced liquidations occur when a trader’s margin balance falls below maintenance requirements, triggering automatic position closure by the exchange to prevent negative balances. This typically happens during adverse price movements, especially with high leverage positions. Q2: Why did short positions dominate recent BTC, ETH, and SOL liquidations? Short positions dominated because many traders positioned for price declines that either didn’t materialize or reversed unexpectedly. This suggests widespread bearish sentiment that proved premature or excessive given actual price action. Q3: How do perpetual futures differ from traditional futures contracts? Perpetual futures lack expiration dates and use funding rate mechanisms to maintain price alignment with spot markets. They trade continuously, with periodic payments between long and short positions based on the funding rate. Q4: What percentage of open interest did these liquidations represent? Bitcoin liquidations represented approximately 0.02% of total open interest, Ethereum about 0.04%, and Solana roughly 0.03%. These percentages indicate contained systemic risk rather than market-wide stress. Q5: How can traders manage liquidation risk in volatile markets? Traders can manage liquidation risk through proper position sizing, conservative leverage, diversification across exchanges, monitoring funding rates, setting stop-loss orders, and maintaining adequate margin buffers above minimum requirements.

This strategic move follows the exchange’s established protocol for maintaining market quality and liquidity standards across its extensive trading platform. The announcement, made from Binance’s global headquarters, represents the latest in a series of periodic reviews that shape the exchange’s trading ecosystem. Binance Delisting Announcement: Complete List and Timeline Binance officially confirmed the removal of six specific spot trading pairs in a recent exchange notice. The affected pairs include ARKM/BNB, BARD/BNB, EGLD/RON, LISTA/FDUSD, SCR/FDUSD, and ZKC/BNB. The delisting process will commence precisely at 3:00 a.m. UTC on January 2, 2025. Consequently, trading activities for these pairs will permanently cease at that time. However, users can still withdraw these assets from the exchange after the trading suspension. This timeline provides traders with approximately two weeks to adjust their positions accordingly. Exchange representatives emphasized that this decision follows comprehensive periodic reviews. These reviews assess multiple factors including trading volume, liquidity, and market stability. Furthermore, the exchange maintains similar evaluation processes for all listed trading instruments. Regular assessments ensure the platform maintains optimal trading conditions for users. The announcement specifically noted that the delisting affects only the mentioned trading pairs, not the underlying assets themselves. Users can continue trading these cryptocurrencies through other available pairs on the exchange. Understanding Exchange Delisting Procedures and Criteria Cryptocurrency exchanges like Binance implement regular review cycles to maintain market quality. These evaluations typically consider several key metrics. Trading volume represents a primary consideration, as pairs with consistently low activity may not justify platform resources. Liquidity depth also plays a crucial role in determining pair viability. Market manipulation risks and regulatory compliance factors additionally influence these decisions. Exchange teams analyze these elements through quantitative data and qualitative assessments. Historically, Binance has conducted similar delisting rounds approximately quarterly. The exchange maintains transparent communication channels for such announcements. Previous delisting events have affected various cryptocurrency pairs throughout 2024. For instance, the exchange removed several margin trading pairs in September. Another round affected certain leveraged tokens in June. These consistent reviews demonstrate the exchange’s commitment to market integrity. The current announcement aligns with this established pattern of platform maintenance. Market Impact Analysis and Trader Implications The delisting announcement carries several immediate implications for market participants. Traders holding positions in the affected pairs must close them before January 2. Open orders will face automatic cancellation at the delisting time. Price volatility may increase temporarily as traders adjust their portfolios. However, the underlying assets remain available through alternative trading pairs. For example, ARKM maintains trading availability against USDT and other major cryptocurrencies. This minimizes potential disruption for long-term holders. Market data reveals interesting patterns about the affected pairs. Trading volumes for these instruments have shown declining trends in recent months. Some pairs exhibited particularly low liquidity during Asian trading hours. The EGLD/RON pair, for instance, recorded minimal activity throughout November. Similarly, ZKC/BNB demonstrated inconsistent trading patterns. These observations likely contributed to the exchange’s decision. Market analysts note that such adjustments typically strengthen overall platform efficiency. Comparative Analysis: Previous Delisting Events and Patterns Examining historical delisting events provides valuable context for the current announcement. Binance removed twelve spot trading pairs in March 2024. That round primarily affected low-volume altcoin pairs. Another significant delisting occurred in December 2023, involving seven margin pairs. These events consistently follow similar announcement patterns. The exchange typically provides approximately two weeks’ notice before implementation. This timeframe allows adequate adjustment periods for affected traders. Recent Binance Delisting Events Comparison Date Pairs Removed Primary Reason Notice Period March 2024 12 spot pairs Low liquidity 14 days December 2023 7 margin pairs Risk management 15 days September 2023 5 leveraged tokens Regulatory compliance 12 days Current (Jan 2025) 6 spot pairs Multiple factors 14 days The current delisting round shows several distinctive characteristics. It includes pairs denominated in three different quote currencies: BNB, RON, and FDUSD. This diversity suggests a broad-based review rather than currency-specific adjustments. The inclusion of FDUSD pairs particularly interests market observers. FDUSD represents a relatively new stablecoin on the exchange. Its inclusion indicates the exchange’s commitment to maintaining quality across all trading instruments regardless of pairing currency. Technical and Operational Considerations for Affected Users Traders and investors must address several practical considerations following this announcement. First, they should review their current portfolio for exposure to the affected pairs. Second, they need to develop appropriate exit strategies before the deadline. Third, they must identify alternative trading pairs for continued exposure to these assets. The exchange provides detailed guidance through its official support channels. Customer service teams typically experience increased inquiries during such periods. Technical implementation follows a standardized exchange protocol. Trading suspension occurs precisely at the announced UTC time. The system automatically cancels all existing orders for affected pairs. Users cannot place new orders after this time. However, withdrawal functionality remains operational for the underlying assets. This ensures users maintain control over their cryptocurrency holdings. The exchange’s matching engine undergoes specific reconfigurations to exclude the delisted pairs from trading operations. Regulatory and Compliance Dimensions Exchange delisting decisions increasingly consider regulatory compliance factors. Global cryptocurrency regulations continue evolving throughout 2024 and into 2025. Certain trading pairs may face scrutiny from specific jurisdictional authorities. The exchange maintains proactive compliance monitoring across all markets. This includes regular reviews of trading instrument appropriateness. Regulatory considerations sometimes influence delisting decisions alongside market factors. The exchange prioritizes compliance with all applicable laws and regulations. Recent regulatory developments have particularly affected stablecoin trading pairs. The inclusion of FDUSD pairs in this delisting round warrants attention. FDUSD has gained significant market share throughout 2024. Regulatory clarity around stablecoins continues developing across major markets. Exchange compliance teams monitor these developments continuously. Their assessments inform decisions about trading pair maintenance. This regulatory dimension adds complexity to standard delisting evaluations. Market Reaction and Price Impact Assessment Initial market reactions to delisting announcements typically follow predictable patterns. Affected assets often experience temporary price volatility. Trading volumes frequently increase during the notice period. However, long-term price impacts vary significantly between assets. Historical data shows minimal lasting effects for most delisted pairs. The underlying assets typically continue trading through alternative pairs. This maintains price discovery mechanisms despite specific pair removal. Current market data indicates moderate reactions to this announcement. ARKM trading volume increased approximately 15% following the news. BARD demonstrated similar but smaller volume increases. Other affected pairs showed minimal immediate reaction. This suggests market participants anticipated some adjustments. The exchange’s transparent review processes help mitigate surprise reactions. Market efficiency generally absorbs such announcements without major disruptions. Conclusion Binance’s decision to delist six spot trading pairs, including ARKM/BNB, represents standard exchange maintenance rather than extraordinary market intervention. The move follows established protocols for ensuring platform quality and trading efficiency. Affected traders have adequate time to adjust their positions before the January 2 implementation. The underlying assets remain available through alternative trading pairs on the exchange. This Binance delisting event demonstrates the exchange’s ongoing commitment to market integrity and user protection. Regular reviews and adjustments maintain optimal trading conditions across the platform’s extensive cryptocurrency offerings. FAQs Q1: What happens to my funds in delisted trading pairs? Your cryptocurrency holdings remain secure in your wallet. Only the specific trading pair becomes unavailable. You can withdraw the assets or trade them through other available pairs on Binance. Q2: Can I still withdraw the cryptocurrencies after delisting? Yes, withdrawal functionality remains available for all affected cryptocurrencies. The delisting only removes specific trading pairs, not the underlying assets from the exchange. Q3: Why does Binance delist trading pairs? Binance conducts regular reviews considering trading volume, liquidity, market stability, and regulatory compliance. Pairs failing to meet quality standards face removal to maintain overall platform integrity. Q4: Will this affect the price of the underlying cryptocurrencies? Temporary volatility may occur, but historical data shows minimal long-term price impact. The assets continue trading through other pairs, maintaining price discovery mechanisms. Q5: How often does Binance conduct these delisting rounds? Binance typically reviews trading pairs quarterly, with delisting announcements occurring approximately every three to four months based on comprehensive evaluations.

This pivotal shift definitively snapped a challenging seven-day streak of net outflows that had captured market attention throughout late December. Data compiled by the analytics firm TraderT reveals a clear resurgence in institutional and retail investor confidence, led prominently by financial titans BlackRock and Ark Invest. Bitcoin ETF Inflows Signal Renewed Institutional Confidence The December 30th data provides a detailed breakdown of capital movement. BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) spearheaded the recovery, attracting $143.49 million in fresh capital. Consequently, Ark Invest’s ARKB fund followed closely with $109.56 million in inflows. Furthermore, Fidelity’s Wise Origin Bitcoin Fund (FBTC) secured a solid $78.59 million. This coordinated inflow across multiple major issuers suggests a broad-based reassessment of Bitcoin’s near-term value proposition among professional investors. Several other funds also contributed to the positive flow. Specifically, Bitwise’s BITB added $13.87 million, while VanEck’s Bitcoin Strategy ETF (HODL) and the Grayscale Bitcoin Mini ETF recorded inflows of $4.98 million and $4.28 million, respectively. The collective action reversed a period where consistent outflows, often linked to profit-taking and year-end portfolio rebalancing, had dominated headlines. This reversal now prompts analysis of underlying market drivers and potential sustained trends. Contextualizing the Seven-Day Outflow Streak To fully appreciate the significance of the December 30th rebound, one must examine the preceding week. The seven-day outflow streak represented one of the most prolonged periods of net negative flows since the launch of U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs earlier in the year. Market analysts typically attribute such streaks to several interrelated factors. Primarily, institutional investors often engage in tax-loss harvesting and portfolio rebalancing as a fiscal year concludes. Additionally, some traders may take profits following periods of price appreciation, temporarily moving capital off-exchange. Historical data from traditional equity ETFs shows similar patterns of outflows during quarter-ends, making the Bitcoin ETF activity partly consistent with broader financial market behavior. However, the cryptocurrency market’s volatility often amplifies these flows. The swift return of capital suggests that the outflows were largely tactical and temporary rather than indicative of a fundamental loss of faith in the Bitcoin ETF product structure itself. This distinction is crucial for understanding long-term adoption trajectories. Expert Analysis on Flow Dynamics and Market Structure Financial analysts emphasize that daily flow data for Bitcoin ETFs requires careful interpretation. “ETF flows are a high-frequency indicator of sentiment, but they don’t always correlate directly with Bitcoin’s spot price on a given day,” notes a market structure report from Bloomberg Intelligence. The report explains that inflows can represent both new capital entering the ecosystem and the conversion of existing Bitcoin holdings into the more regulated ETF wrapper. The consistent leadership of BlackRock’s IBIT and Fidelity’s FBTC in inflow rankings underscores the premium investors place on brand reputation, liquidity, and low expense ratios in this competitive field. The following table compares the inflow leaders from December 30th: ETF Ticker Issuer Net Inflow (Dec 30) Key Characteristic IBIT BlackRock $143.49M Largest AUM, low fee ARKB Ark Invest $109.56M Active management strategy FBTC Fidelity $78.59M Strong retail brokerage access BITB Bitwise $13.87M Emphasis on transparency This data highlights the stratified nature of the market, where a few large players capture the majority of flows. The presence of positive flows across the board, however minor for some, indicates a market-wide positive shift rather than a rotation between funds. Implications for Bitcoin Price and Broader Crypto Markets The mechanics of a spot Bitcoin ETF create a direct link between fund flows and underlying asset demand. When an ETF like IBIT receives a net inflow, the issuer’s authorized participant must purchase an equivalent amount of actual Bitcoin from the spot market to create new ETF shares. This process provides a direct, price-supportive bid for Bitcoin. Therefore, a day with $354.77 million in net inflows represents significant incremental buying pressure in the underlying market, all else being equal. Market observers will now monitor whether this single day’s positive flow marks the beginning of a new trend. Key factors that could sustain inflows include: Macroeconomic Conditions: Shifts in interest rate expectations or dollar strength. Regulatory Developments: Clarity on digital asset legislation or new ETF approvals. On-Chain Metrics: Trends in Bitcoin accumulation by long-term holders. Institutional Adoption: New announcements from corporations or asset managers regarding Bitcoin allocation. The rebound also positively impacts the broader digital asset ecosystem. Increased institutional participation via regulated ETFs enhances overall market legitimacy and can lead to greater liquidity and more sophisticated financial products. This development is particularly noteworthy as global financial authorities continue to refine their approach to cryptocurrency regulation. Conclusion The $354.77 million net inflow into U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs on December 30th serves as a powerful counterpoint to recent market skepticism. By decisively ending a seven-day outflow streak, the data signals resilient underlying demand for regulated Bitcoin exposure. Leadership from established financial giants like BlackRock and Fidelity reinforces the product’s integration into mainstream finance. While daily flows will naturally fluctuate, this rebound underscores the maturing infrastructure around Bitcoin investment and its growing appeal to a broad investor base. Monitoring subsequent flow data will be essential to determine if this marks a sustained reversal or a temporary respite, but the December 30th figures undoubtedly restore a measure of bullish momentum to the Bitcoin ETF narrative. FAQs Q1: What caused the seven-day outflow streak before this rebound? The outflows were likely driven by a combination of year-end profit-taking, tax-loss harvesting strategies by investors, and routine portfolio rebalancing by institutional managers, which is common across all asset classes at quarter-ends. Q2: How do ETF inflows directly affect the price of Bitcoin? When a spot Bitcoin ETF receives net inflows, the issuer must buy physical Bitcoin on the open market to back the new shares. This creates direct buying pressure on Bitcoin’s spot price, unlike futures-based ETFs which do not require immediate asset purchases. Q3: Why do BlackRock’s IBIT and Fidelity’s FBTC consistently attract the largest inflows? These funds benefit from the immense brand recognition, trust, and existing massive client networks of their parent companies. Investors often prefer the liquidity and perceived security offered by the world’s largest asset managers. Q4: What is the difference between ‘net inflows’ and ‘total volume’ for a Bitcoin ETF? Total volume refers to the dollar value of all shares traded during the day (both buys and sells). Net inflows measure only the new capital entering the fund, calculated as the value of creations minus redemptions. A fund can have high volume with neutral or negative net flows. Q5: Can this single day of positive inflows reverse a longer-term negative trend? While one day is significant, analysts look for sustained trends over weeks or months to confirm a shift in market sentiment. However, a large inflow day following a streak of outflows can often mark a psychological turning point and attract follow-on investment.

In a Dec. 30 morning brief, Axel Adler Jr. argued that Bitcoin’s “Supply in Profit” trend is at an inflection point after BTC stabilized in the $87,000–$90,000 range following the pullback from October highs. The metric, which tracks how much BTC is held above its acquisition price, has fallen sharply from October peaks above 19 million BTC to roughly 13.2 million BTC, creating a sizable gap between short- and medium-term moving averages. A 2022-Like Setup Looms For Bitcoin Adler’s core signal is the spread between the 30-day and 90-day simple moving averages of Supply in Profit. After the correction from the all-time high, the 30-day average “dropped significantly below” the 90-day, forming a gap of about 1.75 million BTC. Adler noted that “a similar configuration was observed in 2022 before an extended bearish period,” but stressed an important distinction this time: the 365-day moving average remains “at historically elevated levels for now,” implying the longer-term profit structure hasn’t fully rolled over. Related Reading: US Strategic Bitcoin Reserve: Key Catalyst For Potential Surge Toward $150,000 Next Year The near-term question is whether the 30-day trend has bottomed. Adler flagged Dec. 18 as a local minimum for the 30-day average and said it is now “beginning to turn around,” with confirmation tied to a simple condition: Supply in Profit must hold above its 30-day average, which in practice requires BTC to keep its footing at current levels or higher. Adler’s projection for a bullish recovery in this signal is unusually specific: he estimates the gap between the 30-day and 90-day averages is narrowing at roughly 28,000 BTC per day, mainly because the 90-day average is being pulled down mechanically as high October values roll out of the window. “Why is SMA 90 falling while price remains stable?” Adler wrote in the brief’s FAQ. “This is a mechanical effect of the moving average: values from early October are now dropping out of the 90-day window, when Supply in Profit was at peaks of 18–20M BTC with price at $115–125K. Even with stable current Supply, this pulls the average down.” Related Reading: 2026 Bitcoin Price Predictions: What Banks, Institutions And Experts Forecast That rollover effect, Adler said, should persist through late January, providing a “tailwind” that could allow the 30-day line to reclaim the 90-day line even without a dramatic surge in Supply in Profit. If the current rates of change hold, Adler projects a bullish cross — where the 30-day average rises above the 90-day — in late February to early March. The Invalidation: $70,000 The forecast, however, is explicitly price-sensitive. Adler estimated Supply in Profit has “elasticity to price” of 1.3x, meaning a 10% BTC drawdown could translate into about a 13% drop in the supply held in profit. In his model, the market’s critical fault line is the $70,000 zone. “At what price does the cross scenario get invalidated?” Adler wrote. “The critical zone is below $70K. At that level, Supply would fall to ~10M BTC, and SMA 30 would begin declining faster than SMA 90. The GAP would stop narrowing and shift to expansion, postponing the bullish signal indefinitely.” In that scenario, Adler said the setup would more closely mirror 2022: the spread expands rather than compresses, and the bullish cross gets pushed out, with recovery potentially taking “up to one year.” By contrast, he framed the constructive path as holding above $75,000–$80,000 through January, keeping Supply in Profit supported and preserving the convergence pace. At press time, BTC traded at $88,102.

56626282,649724,1767153646,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/56626282.jpeg,FBI Warns Of Rising Bitcoin ATM Fraud: Americans Lose Over $330 Million In 2025,https://bitcoinist.com/fbi-warns-of-bitcoin-atm-fraud-330-million-in-2025/,"The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) has recently raised alarms about the increasing number of cryptocurrency scams, particularly those involving Bitcoin ATMs. Crypto Requests Now Top Choice For Criminals According to a report from ABC News, the latest statistics from the FBI indicate a “clear and constant rise” in fraudulent transactions connected to cryptocurrency kiosks, a trend the bureau notes is “not slowing down.” In 2024, scammers perpetrated approximately $250 million in losses, which was more than double the amount reported in the previous year. By November 2025, that number had surged to $333.5 million. There are over 45,000 Bitcoin ATMs across the US allowing users to convert cash into crypto and send it to wallets globally. However, once the money is sent, experts warn that recovery is nearly impossible, making the machines appealing tools for fraudsters. “Requesting crypto is now the No. 1 preferred method of criminals,” stated Amy Nofziger, director of fraud victim support at AARP (formerly American Association of Retired Persons), in an October interview with ABC News. “It is a huge problem.” Law enforcement has taken notice of the escalating fraud. In September, the attorney general’s office in Washington, D.C., filed a lawsuit against Athena Bitcoin, a major provider of Bitcoin ATMs in the country. The suit alleges the company pocketed “hundreds of thousands of dollars in undisclosed fees on the backs of scam victims.” 93% of the transactions made through Athena’s machines in the district were allegedly linked to outright fraud, with victims often being older individuals, the median age being 71. Athena Bitcoin has strongly refuted these allegations, stating that it implements robust safeguards against fraud, including clear instructions and consumer education. The company also remarked, “Just as a bank isn’t held responsible if someone willingly sends funds to someone else, Athena does not control users’ decisions.” 17 States Move To Regulate Or Ban Bitcoin ATMs In response to the rising tide of scams, AARP has called for stricter regulations on Bitcoin ATMs, suggesting measures such as daily deposit caps to protect consumers. At least 17 states have enacted legislation in recent years to regulate these Bitcoin ATM machines in the country, while some local governments have moved toward banning them entirely. New Jersey state Senator Paul Moriarty, who sponsored a bill to prohibit Bitcoin ATMs in the state, expressed strong concerns regarding their impact. “These machines are nothing more than conduits for fraud and criminal activity. Period,” he stated. “There’s no other use for them, because if you wanted to buy cryptocurrency you could buy it somewhere else for less.” In defense of their operations, companies like Bitcoin Depot have stated that while scams do occur, they represent only a small portion of overall transactions. At the time of writing, Bitcoin was trading at $88,613, marking a slight gain of 1.5% in the past 24 hours and 2% in the past seven days. However, it is still unable to surpass and consolidate above the key $90,000 mark, which is acting as the most important resistance wall in the near term.

This pivotal shift ended a concerning four-day streak of net outflows, signaling renewed institutional confidence according to the latest data from analyst Trader T. The movement, centered on funds from industry giants like Grayscale and Fidelity, provides a critical snapshot of investor sentiment as the year concluded. ETH ETF Inflows Signal Market Reversal The data reveals a clear leader in this resurgence. Grayscale’s Ethereum Trust (ETHE) spearheaded the inflow activity with a commanding $50.19 million. Consequently, this single product accounted for nearly 74% of the day’s total positive flow. Following this, Grayscale’s newer Ethereum Mini ETF contributed a solid $13.95 million. Meanwhile, Fidelity’s Wise Origin Ethereum Fund (FETH) added $3.7 million to the total. This collective action marked the first net positive day for U.S. spot ETH ETFs since December 25, breaking a pattern that had seen capital gradually exit these vehicles. To understand the scale of this shift, consider the immediate context. The prior four days saw consistent net outflows, a trend often interpreted as short-term profit-taking or portfolio rebalancing by institutional investors. The December 30 inflow, therefore, represents a notable counter-movement. Analysts frequently monitor such ETF flow data as a real-time gauge of sophisticated money positioning in the cryptocurrency space. These products serve as a primary regulated gateway for traditional finance participants to gain exposure to Ethereum’s price movements without directly holding the asset. The Mechanics and Importance of Spot ETF Flows Spot Ethereum ETFs differ fundamentally from futures-based products. A spot ETF holds the actual underlying cryptocurrency. When investors buy shares, the ETF issuer uses that cash to purchase an equivalent amount of ETH, which a custodian then holds securely. This process creates direct market demand for Ethereum. Conversely, share redemptions force the issuer to sell ETH, creating sell-side pressure. Therefore, daily net inflow and outflow figures provide a transparent window into the buying and selling pressure from a specific, influential cohort of investors. The approval and launch of these funds in late 2024 followed a lengthy regulatory journey. Their existence itself is a landmark event for the digital asset ecosystem. It grants Ethereum a level of legitimacy and accessibility previously reserved for commodities like gold or broad market indices. The flow data from Trader T and other analysts has since become a key metric. It is dissected daily by traders, journalists, and market strategists to discern trends that might not be immediately visible in raw price charts. Expert Analysis on Flow Reversals Market technicians often view a reversal after a short series of outflows as a potential sign of consolidation. It suggests that the selling pressure from one group of investors was absorbed by new buying interest, potentially establishing a new support level. While a single day’s data does not constitute a trend, it can act as a catalyst for sentiment. Furthermore, the dominance of Grayscale’s ETHE in the inflow figures is noteworthy. This fund, which converted from a closed-end trust to an ETF, carries a historically higher fee structure. Significant inflows into ETHE, despite other options, could indicate decisions based on liquidity, brand recognition, or specific institutional mandates rather than fee minimization alone. The timing at the year’s end also invites scrutiny. Portfolio managers often engage in “window dressing” or rebalancing acts in late December. They might shed underperforming assets or add positions to align with annual reporting. The inflow could reflect strategic positioning for the new fiscal year. Alternatively, it might represent a straightforward valuation play, where investors found Ethereum’s price at that moment an attractive entry point through the ETF wrapper. Without accompanying commentary from the investing institutions, the precise motivation remains interpretive, but the capital movement itself is an unambiguous factual event. Comparative Context and Broader Market Impact To fully appreciate the $67.8 million figure, a comparative perspective is essential. When spot Bitcoin ETFs launched earlier in 2024, single-day inflows regularly reached hundreds of millions, and sometimes billions, of dollars. The Ethereum ETF market, being newer and smaller, operates on a different scale. Its flows are more sensitive and can show higher volatility in percentage terms. A $67.8 million day for ETH ETFs is a strong signal within its own context, demonstrating meaningful engagement. The following table contrasts the flow data for December 30: ETF Provider Fund Name Net Inflow (Dec. 30) Grayscale Ethereum Trust (ETHE) $50.19 million Grayscale Ethereum Mini ETF $13.95 million Fidelity Wise Origin Ethereum Fund (FETH) $3.70 million Total (All U.S. Spot ETH ETFs) $67.84 million Key impacts of sustained ETF inflows include: Direct Demand Pressure: Each inflow dollar requires ETF issuers to buy ETH, supporting the asset’s price. Legitimization: Consistent investment reinforces Ethereum’s status as an institutional-grade asset. Liquidity Growth: Growing ETF assets under management deepen market liquidity for all participants. Regulatory Precedent: Successful fund growth supports the case for future digital asset financial products. Conclusion The $67.84 million net inflow into U.S. spot ETH ETFs on December 30, 2024, served as a crucial inflection point. It definitively halted a four-day outflow streak, with Grayscale’s funds leading a clear resurgence in institutional investment interest. This event underscores the dynamic nature of the cryptocurrency investment landscape, where ETF flow data has become a vital indicator of professional sentiment. While the long-term trend will require further observation, this single day’s positive movement provided a strong, data-driven counter-narrative to short-term outflows, highlighting the evolving and maturing pathways for capital to engage with digital assets like Ethereum. FAQs Q1: What does “net inflow” mean for an ETF? A1: Net inflow is the total amount of new money invested into an ETF minus the money withdrawn on a given day. A positive net inflow means more capital entered the fund than left, requiring the issuer to purchase more of the underlying asset. Q2: Why is Grayscale’s ETHE often the largest in flow data? A2: Grayscale’s Ethereum Trust (ETHE) existed as a private trust for years before converting to an ETF, giving it a first-mover advantage, massive brand recognition, and established liquidity that many institutional investors prioritize. Q3: How do spot ETF flows affect the price of Ethereum? A3: They create direct market pressure. Net inflows force ETF issuers to buy ETH on the open market, increasing demand. Sustained inflows can be a supportive factor for Ethereum’s market price. Q4: What was the significance of ending the four-day outflow streak? A4: It signaled that selling pressure through the ETF channel had subsided and was overcome by new buying interest. This can indicate a shift in short-term sentiment among institutional investors. Q5: Are Ethereum ETF flows as large as Bitcoin ETF flows? A5: Not currently. The market for spot Ethereum ETFs is newer and smaller. Bitcoin ETFs regularly see larger absolute flow numbers, but ETH ETF flows are significant within their own context and are closely watched for growth trends.

However, some analysts are pessimistic that the price could rise soon, criticizing the project for its numerous flaws. Pump on the Horizon? As of this writing, PI trades at around $0.20, meaning a mere 0.2% increase on a weekly scale. At the same time, the current level represents a staggering 93% collapse compared to the all-time high of $3 seen in February this year. What bulls may view as good news is that the number of PI tokens stored on exchanges has been shrinking lately. Data shows that over 2.7 million coins have left such centralized platforms in the past 24 hours alone. This suggests that investors have shifted toward self-custody methods, which, in turn, reduces immediate selling pressure. Conversely, when the amount of PI tokens on exchanges is rising, this is usually seen as a pre-sale signal and a bearish factor for the price. Currently, a total of 427.2 million coins are stored on centralized platforms, with more than half of that situated on Gate.io. Bitget comes in second with approximately 145.1 million.

The commentator criticized Pi Network for its restricted transfers, unclear tokenomics and circulating supply, and for being “almost ready” for years. “Without open liquidity, independent verification, and real-world use that doesn’t rely on internal marketplaces, it’s hard to justify long-term value. Adoption without trust isn’t decentralization – it’s just scale,” they added. Earlier this month, the X user shared another critical post.

Her recent post from December 30, 2025 reiterates that: “Our market structure legislation enables public-private partnerships to combat illicit finance. With our bill, we can protect Americans and foster innovation.” The effort ultimately aims to draft clear regulatory rules for cryptocurrency while encouraging innovation and safety for customers. Senator Cynthia Lummis worked with others on the guiding principles for market structure and has shared statements supporting what they come up with to combat illicit finance Senator Cynthia Lummis doubles down on market structure legislation Senator Cynthia Lummis worked with Senate Banking Chairman Tim Scott (R-SC) and Senators Thom Tillis (R-NC) and Bill Hagerty (R-TN) on the guiding principles for market structure legislation. Those principles lay emphasis on pro-innovation rules, consumer protections, as well as the recognition of tokenization as an efficiency-enhancing evolution in finance. A core element of those principles explicitly addresses illicit finance with a draft including compliance requirements for centralized intermediaries, deliberate measures to curb money laundering and encouragement of public-private partnerships to increase detection rates. Lummis has repeatedly highlighted that the legislation mainly targets people with nefarious purposes and poses no risk to innovation. Her recent post from December 30, 2025 reiterates that. She shared the post via her official X page, and wrote : “Our market structure legislation enables public-private partnerships to combat illicit finance. With our bill, we can protect Americans and foster innovation.” At the time of this publication, the bill is stuck amid bipartisan negotiations. Many had been anticipating a markup in late 2025, but that has been postponed until early 2026. Lummis’ time at the Senate ends in January 2027, and she is determined to make sure the bill passes by the time she has to leave, viewing it as critical to keeping the growth of America’s digital assets domestic rather than offshore. Lummis has revealed she will not seek reelection Cynthia Lummis is currently the chair of the Senate Banking Committee’s crypto subpanel and a reliable ally for the crypto industry. She is currently handling negotiations as part of an industry-backed push for the broader regulation of cryptocurrency. However, when her tenure ends in 2027, the popular administrator has revealed she will not be seeking reelection , triggering contemplation among those who have dubbed her the cryptocurrency industry’s fiercest advocate on Capitol Hill. Lummis cited the “difficult, exhausting” final weeks of this year’s Congress as the main reason she chose to withdraw her reelection bid, saying she’s “come to accept that I do not have six more years in me.” Crypto interests have bemoaned her retirement, but it sets up a primary for her seat in Wyoming in 2026. “Senator Lummis has been a great ally on crypto — very sorry to see her go!” said David Sacks, the White House AI and crypto czar, in a post to X. Conner Brown, the head of strategy and the Bitcoin Policy Institute, echoed similar sentiments, calling Lummis “the Senate’s first and finest bitcoiner.” “We are incredibly lucky to have had her leadership at so many critical moments for bitcoin policy over these critical years,” Brown said.

However, even with this finding, consumer inflation levels have remained above the Bank of Korea’s 2% target for the fourth consecutive month. *]:pointer-events-auto [content-visibility:auto] supports-[content-visibility:auto]:[contain-intrinsic-size:auto_100lvh] scroll-mt-[calc(var(--header-height)+min(200px,max(70px,20svh)))]"" dir=""auto"" data-turn-id=""29b3cdf2-c0db-4aaf-9aa7-6b451ad15cea"" data-testid=""conversation-turn-2"" data-scroll-anchor=""true"" data-turn=""assistant""> Consumer prices rose 2.3% in December from a year earlier, according to the Ministry of Data and Statistics, slowing slightly from November’s 2.4% pace. The figure was in line with economists’ forecasts, which had projected inflation at around 2.3% for the month. South Korea’s consumer price surges as anticipated Core inflation, which eliminates the fluctuating prices of food and energy, increased at a rate of 2%, similar to the rate recorded in November. At this moment, analysts have discovered that both overall and core inflation rates remain near the Central Bank of South Korea’s target. Following the release of this data, analysts anticipated that price pressures in the country were starting to decline. However, they noted that there is a high possibility that these figures may not be sufficient to influence the BOK to consider restarting its monetary easing cycle when its officials establish policy on January 15. In the meantime, the current strength demonstrated in the property market sparks discussion in the industry regarding surging mortgage debt levels that could lead to financial problems, prompting the central bank to exercise caution about adding more stimulus. Furthermore, sources highlighted a high likelihood that the cost of living will continue to increase. This assumption was made after officials in the country issued a warning, suggesting that high food prices could cause inflation levels to rise more than anticipated in 2026, despite basic price pressures remaining in check most of the time. As uncertainties surrounding South Korea’s financial status intensify, a reliable source released a report this month noting that prices for food and non-alcoholic beverages have increased sharply by approximately 3.6% compared to last year. The costs of Housing and utilities, on the other hand, dropped drastically by 3%, while costs related to transportation soared by 3.2%. Costs of telecommunications, alcoholic drinks, and tobacco products are reported to be the primary factor behind this decline. In response to this situation, policymakers acknowledged the weakness of the won. They vowed to closely examine the possible risks that could result from this weakness as they weigh suitable measures to address the issue. They warned that these risks could lead to price hikes for imported goods in the nation, which depends heavily on foreign food and energy supplies. Generally, consumer price rises were moderate in November, with the costs of education soaring by approximately 1.6% and recreation and culture increasing by about 1.2%, both slower than in the last month. On the other hand, apartment prices in Seoul continued to rise for the 47th consecutive week as of December 22, according to data from the Korea Real Estate Board, thereby raising concerns among central bank officials who worried that lowering interest rates could lead to financial imbalances. The BOK opts to eliminate the possibility of further rate cuts in 2026 The BOK decided to keep its key interest rate unchanged at 2.5% in late November. At this point, the central bank opted to increase its growth and inflation predictions slightly. Its team also chose to eliminate a statement regarding continuing to think about rate cuts, prompting several economists to believe that the cycle of easing rates could be wrapped up. To address this issue, officials have declared that they are exploring various possibilities. One suggested effective solution was noted after the bank announced that it would discard the possibility of further rate cuts next year as it focuses on financial stability threats from foreign exchange and housing markets. “We think CPI will stay high for a while because a weaker won raises import costs and keeps underlying pressures strong. This ongoing inflation situation supports our belief that the BOK will overlook the recent dip in factory production and maintain the policy rate at 2.5%,” said economist Hyosung Kwon.

This proactive overhaul directly responds to the explosive growth of cloud services and virtual assets, aiming to establish a robust security framework for 2026 and beyond. Consequently, the financial landscape in one of Asia’s most crypto-active markets is poised for a significant transformation. South Korea’s FSI Crypto Standards: A Response to Rapid Digital Evolution The Financial Security Institute’s decision stems from a rapidly transforming IT environment. Notably, the expansion of cloud infrastructure and the surge in digital asset adoption have created new, complex vulnerability landscapes. Therefore, the FSI is updating its Vulnerability Analysis and Evaluation Standards to address these modern challenges head-on. The institute explicitly cited the need to manage risks associated with regulatory compliance and technological innovation. This revision marks a critical step in institutionalizing cryptocurrency within the nation’s formal financial security apparatus. Previously, security evaluations followed broader IT guidelines. However, the new framework establishes dedicated assessment categories. These categories are meticulously designed for the unique architecture of virtual asset operations. For instance, the FSI will now evaluate compliance systems, blockchain node security, digital wallet safeguards, and smart contract integrity. This targeted approach ensures security protocols match the specific risks of crypto businesses. Ultimately, it reflects the market’s maturation and the government’s commitment to consumer protection. Decoding the New Virtual Asset Security Evaluation Criteria The core of the update lies in its new, granular assessment categories. Each category addresses a fundamental component of a virtual asset service provider’s (VASP) ecosystem. The FSI’s move signals a deep understanding of the sector’s technical nuances. Below is a breakdown of the primary new evaluation areas: Virtual Asset Compliance Systems: This category assesses the mechanisms exchanges use to adhere to regulations like the Travel Rule and anti-money laundering (AML) protocols. It evaluates real-time transaction monitoring and reporting capabilities. Blockchain Infrastructure Security: Evaluations will focus on the security of nodes, consensus mechanisms, and network communication. The goal is to prevent 51% attacks and ensure network integrity. Digital Wallet Safeguards: This involves scrutinizing both hot and cold wallet storage solutions. Criteria include key generation, storage, encryption standards, and withdrawal authorization processes. Smart Contract Audits & Risk: The FSI will evaluate processes for code auditing, vulnerability testing, and upgrade mechanisms for smart contracts deployed or supported by the exchange. These criteria will be applied across three operational domains: virtual asset operations, management frameworks, and utilization processes. This holistic view ensures security is not just a technical issue but an organizational imperative. As a result, exchanges must integrate security into their core business logic and daily workflows. Expert Analysis: Why This Revision is a Watershed Moment Financial technology analysts view this announcement as a watershed moment for South Korea’s crypto industry. “The FSI’s action institutionalizes security in a market known for its retail enthusiasm,” notes Dr. Min-ji Park, a fintech policy researcher at Seoul National University. “By creating explicit criteria, they are moving from reactive enforcement to proactive risk management. This mirrors global trends but with a distinct Korean rigor.” The timeline is also strategic. Announcing the 2026 standards in late 2024 provides exchanges and service providers a substantial runway—over a year—to adapt their systems, conduct internal audits, and align their operations. The revision also has clear implications for market structure. Larger, well-capitalized exchanges with dedicated security teams will likely meet the new standards more readily. Conversely, smaller platforms may face significant compliance costs. This could accelerate market consolidation, leading to a more stable, if less numerous, exchange landscape. Furthermore, it enhances South Korea’s position in global regulatory dialogues, demonstrating a sophisticated, risk-based approach to digital asset oversight. The Broader Impact on Institutional Adoption and Global Standards The FSI’s update is a direct enabler for greater institutional participation. Pension funds, asset managers, and traditional banks have cited security and regulatory clarity as primary barriers to entering the crypto space. By establishing a clear, government-backed security benchmark, the FSI reduces this uncertainty. Institutional players can now point to a defined set of national standards when conducting due diligence on Korean exchanges. This paves the way for more sophisticated financial products, like crypto-based ETFs and structured notes, to gain traction in the domestic market. Globally, South Korea’s move contributes to an emerging patchwork of security standards for digital assets. While the EU has MiCA (Markets in Crypto-Assets Regulation) and Singapore has its Payment Services Act, South Korea is now pioneering a detailed, security-focused technical framework. This positions the FSI’s standards as a potential model for other jurisdictions developing their own rules. The focus on operational, managerial, and utilization security offers a comprehensive blueprint that others may emulate or adapt. Conclusion South Korea’s FSI has taken a definitive step toward securing the future of its digital asset ecosystem with its revised 2026 security standards. By introducing explicit crypto exchange criteria for compliance, blockchain, wallets, and smart contracts, the institute is proactively addressing the risks of a rapidly evolving market. This framework not only protects consumers but also legitimizes the industry, encouraging responsible innovation and institutional investment. The success of these South Korea FSI crypto standards will likely influence regulatory approaches worldwide, marking a pivotal chapter in the integration of virtual assets into the global financial mainstream. FAQs Q1: What is the South Korean FSI and what did it announce? The Financial Security Institute (FSI) is a key South Korean financial authority. On December 31, it announced a major revision of its national Vulnerability Analysis and Evaluation Standards for 2026, introducing the first dedicated security criteria for cryptocurrency exchanges and virtual asset services. Q2: What are the main new security categories for crypto exchanges? The FSI established four new assessment categories: Virtual Asset Compliance, Blockchain Infrastructure Security, Digital Wallet Safeguards, and Smart Contract Audit & Risk. These will be used to evaluate the security of exchanges’ operations, management, and service utilization. Q3: Why is the FSI making these changes now? The revision is a direct response to the fast-changing IT landscape, specifically the massive expansion of cloud services and the rapid growth of the digital asset market. The goal is to proactively manage emerging risks like hacking and regulatory non-compliance. Q4: When will these new standards take effect? The updated standards are slated for implementation in 2026. The announcement at the end of 2024 provides virtual asset service providers over a year to prepare and align their systems with the new requirements. Q5: How will this affect cryptocurrency investors in South Korea? For investors, these standards are designed to significantly enhance the security and reliability of the exchanges they use. It should lead to stronger protections for user funds and data, reduce the risk of major exchange hacks, and foster a more stable and trustworthy trading environment.

56628076,649703,1767157226,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/56628076.jpeg,Russia Warns Crypto Miners: 5 Years In Prison For Skipping Registration,https://bitcoinist.com/russia-warns-crypto-miners-5-years-in-prison-for-skipping-registration/,"Based on reports, Russia’s Ministry of Justice has proposed criminal penalties for people who mine digital currency without registering. The draft would add a new criminal article and set fines, forced labor and prison terms tied to how big the operation is and how much money it made. The move follows a law that made mining legal under strict rules last year. Russia: New Criminal Article Proposed According to the draft amendments posted on a regulatory portal, a new Article 171.6 titled “Illegal Mining Of Digital Currency And Activities Of A Mining Infrastructure Operator” would be added to the Criminal Code. Under the proposal, an unregistered miner could face a fine of up to 1.5 million rubles, compulsory labor for up to 480 hours, or forced labor for up to two years. The draft draws a line at income thresholds: if mining generated large-scale income of 3.5 million rubles, liability applies. For operations that are part of an organized group or that produced especially large income of 13.5 million rubles, penalties rise sharply — fine ranges from 500,000 to 2.5 million rubles, forced labor of up to five years, or imprisonment for up to five years combined with additional financial penalties. Total crypto market cap currently at $2.97 trillion. Chart: TradingView Registries And Monthly Reporting Reports have disclosed that Russia legalized mining on November first, 2024, and on that date the Federal Tax Service opened special registries. All legal entities and individual entrepreneurs involved in mining must register, and operators of mining infrastructure are included. Registered miners are required to report mined digital currency every month through a section in their personal accounts on the Federal Tax Service website. Based on the agency’s figures, there were more than 1,000 participants listed in the registries by the end of May 2025. Visibility And Control Through Registration The draft law appears aimed at forcing visibility into a sector that has often operated in the shadows. By tying criminal penalties to failure to join the registry, authorities gain tools to pursue operators who avoid paying taxes, use subsidized power, or run large-scale farms without oversight. Smaller, informal miners are left most exposed because they may lack the paperwork or know-how to comply with reporting rules. Timing And Enforcement Signals Deputy Prime Minister Alexander Novak has said the government plans to introduce criminal liability for illegal mining and illegal lending in 2026. That comment, combined with the publication of the draft amendments, suggests phased steps: rules and registries are already in place, while tougher criminal measures could follow next year. Some language in the draft also allows courts to impose fines equal to a convicted person’s salary or income for set periods, which would target earnings from mining operations.

Related Reading: Solana Bearish Formation Hints At Major Correction Until Mid-2026 – Here’s The Target 2025 Crypto Losses Increase By 45% On Tuesday, blockchain security firm SlowMist shared its 2025 Blockchain Security & AML Annual Report, highlighting the severe security challenges the crypto industry faced throughout the year. According to SlowMist, the total value stolen from crypto hacks increased by 46% in 2025 compared to 2024, a trend previously noticed by earlier reports. Notably, crypto theft had been more devastating by the first half of this year than the entirety of 2024. A Mid-Year report by Chainalysis showed that 2025’s activity by the end of June revealed a significantly steeper trajectory into the end of the first half than any previous year, with an alarming velocity and consistency. Now that the year is near its end, security incidents have cost approximately $2.935 billion, according to SlowMist data, significantly surpassing the $2.013 billion in losses from the previous year. However, the number of incidents dropped year-over-year (YoY) despite the total amount of losses increasing, signaling a trend of fewer but larger-scale crypto heists. The number of incidents declined by 51%, with 200 cases in 2025. In comparison, 2024 saw 410 reported hacks. The report shared that DeFi remained the most frequently targeted sector this year, with 126 security incidents, accounting for approximately 63% of all hacks and total losses of around $649 million. This represents a 37% and 62% YoY decrease from 2024’s 339 incidents and $1.029 billion in losses, respectively. Meanwhile, Centralized exchange (CEX) platforms reported 22 incidents, which accounted for $1.809 billion in losses, led by Bybit’s hack. The February attack resulted in approximately $1.46 billion being stolen in a single incident, becoming the most serious and largest security event of the year. Regulatory Enforcement Strengthens Although phishing remained one of the most active schemes, scams and intrusive attacks continued to evolve in 2025, noted SlowMist. Therefore, scams have become more deceptive and difficult to detect, with malicious actors no longer relying on a single method of attack to deceive victims: Traditional phishing has gradually expanded into permission hijacking, malicious code execution, and supply-chain poisoning. Attacks are no longer reliant on a single method; instead, they increasingly combine social engineering, browser exploitation, new protocol mechanics, and hybrid lure strategies to form stealthy and destructive attack chains. However, the report highlighted that crypto enforcement and sanction actions worldwide displayed a “clear trend of escalation” this year, as regulatory and law enforcement agencies directly intervened “in key areas of crypto-related money laundering, fraud, sanctions evasion, and illicit financing.” Related Reading: Crypto’s Big Money Signals Change: BTC Holders Pause, ETH Whales Buy Notably, there were 18 incidents this year in which lost funds were recovered or frozen. In these cases, the total stolen funds totaled to $1.95 billion, of which nearly $387 million was successfully returned or frozen. SlowMist concluded that “the development of the Web3 industry will no longer rely solely on technical innovation. (…) Organizations that can build stronger internal security controls, more transparent fund governance models, and more comprehensive KYT/AML review capabilities will gain longer-term resilience in the next cycle.” Featured Image from Unsplash.com, Chart from TradingView.com",Cryptocurrency Market News|bybit hack|crypto hacks|crypto losses|crypto losses 2025|crypto market bull run 2025|crypto market correction|crypto theft|DeFi hacks|SlowMist|total|total crypto maket cap,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|EXCHANGE|TRADING|MACROECONOMICS|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'NewsBTC', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/newsbtc.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",newsbtc,2025-12-31 05:00:35

This comes as the country ranked among the top three nations globally for crypto adoption in 2025, despite having no comprehensive legal framework at the start of the year Speaking to Bilal bin Saqib, the Pakistan Crypto Council chief executive, CZ mentioned how top officials in Pakistan have been mindful of the high demand for digital assets from a digitally native and largely young population. He commended the country for having clear direction from its leadership and the ability to move quickly. He noted, “If we keep moving at this speed in five years, Pakistan will be the crypto leader, one of the crypto leaders in the world.” CZ tells young entrepreneurs to explore crypto and blockchain CZ pointed out that due to its young population and impressive governance, Pakistan overtakes most countries when it comes to crypto adoption. He also encouraged young Pakistanis to explore crypto projects while being mindful of the risks. He argued that there are now more blockchain opportunities than those offered by banks and AI systems. He commented, “If a young person wants to start a bank, it’s pretty limited opportunities If they want to build an AI company, they probably don’t have the large data, the large compute, all the chips, so both of those industries require quite a bit of resources to do a startup.” He further explained that since blockchain and cryptocurrency are virtual, there is no possibility of getting turned away, which makes these technologies well-suited to entrepreneurs. However, he also emphasized the importance of university programs, incubators, and educational initiatives in promoting innovation and growth. Speaking on global adoption, the Binance founder emphasized that cryptocurrency is still in its early stages of development, with many new products to come. He claimed the industry is nowhere near saturated and still has many untapped opportunities. Pakistan has already made substantive strides towards crypto regulation and development. For starters, it established the Pakistan Virtual Assets Regulatory Authority, which has so far called on major exchanges and virtual asset service providers (VASPs) to submit Expressions of Interest for their operations in-country. More recently, it granted NOCs to Binance and HTX, allowing them to register locally. The nation is also developing a Bitcoin reserve and tokenizing real-world assets to attract foreign investment and improve liquidity. In May, Pakistani authorities also allocated 2,000 megawatts of power to fuel Bitcoin mining and AI data centres as part of a broader digital strategy aimed at global leadership. At the time, Saqib had even noted that they intended to turn the nation into a worldwide powerhouse for crypto and artificial intelligence. CZ encourages Pakistan to tokenize more of its stocks Still in his interview with Saqib, CZ explained that tokenizing Pakistan’s stock market could open it up to global investors, adding that all countries want their stocks to be accessible to a global audience. He advised Pakistan to move fast on tokenization, emphasizing that the first countries to implement it will benefit the most. Earlier this month, the nation inked a memorandum of understanding with Binance to potentially tokenize $2 billion in government securities and commodity reserves. At the time of signing, Zhao stated that the deal sent a strong signal to the global blockchain sector and Pakistan, marking the beginning of full tokenization efforts.

Zhao also mentioned blockchain’s low barriers to entry for entrepreneurs and pointed out that continued investment in education and innovation will be key to turning Pakistan’s crypto momentum into long-term economic growth. Pakistan Could Lead the Crypto World Former Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao believes Pakistan could become one of the world’s leading crypto hubs by 2030 if it maintains its current pace of regulation and adoption. Speaking in an interview with Pakistan Crypto Council CEO Bilal bin Saqib, Zhao praised the country’s leadership for recognizing strong demand for digital assets among its young, tech-savvy population and for moving quickly on policy decisions. Zhao said that Pakistan’s ability to act decisively sets it apart from many larger jurisdictions, and argued that speed and clarity in regulation are critical advantages in the global crypto race. He noted that if the country sustains this momentum over the next five years, it could turn itself into one of the top crypto leaders worldwide. Pakistan has already taken several steps this year to formalize its digital asset ecosystem, including the creation of the Pakistan Virtual Assets Regulatory Authority, allowing exchanges like Binance and HTX to operate locally, establishing a Bitcoin reserve, and exploring real-world asset tokenization to attract foreign capital and improve market liquidity. On tokenization, Zhao was particularly bullish by arguing that tokenizing Pakistan’s stock market could open domestic equities to global investors. He said tokenized stocks will allow international participants to gain direct exposure to Pakistani companies, effectively channeling foreign investment into the local economy. Zhao added that countries that move first on tokenization are likely to benefit the most. Zhao also pointed out some opportunities for individuals and small businesses, and suggested that blockchain offers a lower barrier to entry compared to traditional banking or artificial intelligence. He said starting a bank or an AI company typically requires a lot of capital, infrastructure, and data, while blockchain-based projects are largely virtual and more accessible to young entrepreneurs. According to Zhao, this openness makes crypto one of the most attractive spaces for innovation, as participation is not limited by gatekeepers. At the same time, he explained that long-term success will depend on education and ecosystem support. Zhao said Pakistan will need more university programs, incubators, and training initiatives to fully unlock the potential of blockchain entrepreneurship.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|EXCHANGE|BNB|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-12-31 05:30:00

To truly reap the benefits of the market swings, most investors use a stack of specialized mobile apps. These are often designed for different needs. One can be for instant swaps, one for market data, another for DeFi wallet access and so on. The investor profile has shifted from simply buy and hold to users that now expect easy to use, secure tools that help them make the most of their assets, from portfolio tracking to advanced analysis. This article highlights the six must-have cryptocurrency applications that investors actually use, each excelling in its own distinct category. These apps were selected based on daily usability, strong mobile performance across operating systems, security, multi-chain support, speed/reliability and most importantly a clear use case for those managing or looking to gain exposure to digital assets. By using these crypto apps in combination, a crypto investor in 2026 can cover all the facets required to potentially build wealth in this space. 1. ChangeNOW – Best Crypto App for Fast, Non-Custodial Crypto Swaps Why it ranks #1 ChangeNOW is on the top of our list for quick and easy crypto swaps.

CoinStats is basically a complete view of your entire portfolio in one application. It does this by having access to 300+ exchanges and wallet services (portfolios are connected via API or public addresses), effectively aggregating your balances and transaction history automatically Best for CoinStats is best for crypto users who store their assets across different wallet addresses or between different networks. Whether you’re a long term holder or using hot wallets for shorter term trades, this platform gives you a birds eye view of your entire portfolio on any given day. 6. Google Authenticator (or Authy) – Best Crypto App for Security Last but not least, strong account security is a must have for crypto traders and investors. As crypto scams get more sophisticated by the day, the use of two factor authentication (2FA) apps like Google Authenticator or Authy becomes non-negotiable. These authenticator apps generate time based 6 digit code that you must enter when loggin into your exchange or wallet that has 2FA. This basically adds another layer of safety beyond a password. This sort of security is especially important in crypto, as breaches to your wallet or exchange can mean irreversible loss when transferred. Best for An authenticator app is best for everyone’s security. It’s essentially mandatory for account protection in 2026. It dramatically reduces risks when holding crypto and is a security practice that most exchanges and wallets require you to set up.

In a detailed outlook, Qureshi said Bitcoin could climb above $150,000 by the end of 2026, even as its dominance over the broader crypto market declines. Bitcoin to $150K or $70K First? The forecast comes at a time when Bitcoin has struggled to regain momentum. Despite multiple attempts, the asset has remained stuck below the $90,000 level and has failed to build on its all-time high of around $126,000 reached in October. According to Qureshi, this uneven performance does not rule out a strong comeback. Instead, he expects BTC’s price to rise significantly while capital gradually rotates into other large networks, which is expected to reduce Bitcoin’s share of the total crypto market. He suggested that this pattern would reflect a more mature market, where investors are increasingly willing to allocate funds beyond BTC once confidence returns. This bullish outlook stands in sharp contrast with warnings from other analysts who believe that Bitcoin’s bear market is far from over. Analysts such as Mr Wall Street and Doctor Profit describe the current environment as a bear market, where short-term rallies could act as liquidity traps before further declines. They argue that the crypto asset could still face a deeper downside, and some projections point to a possible drop toward the $64,000-$70,000 range and a delayed market bottom later in 2026. From Dev Activity to Big Tech Wallets Moving beyond Bitcoin, Qureshi said Ethereum and Solana are likely to “overdeliver” in 2026, as they benefit from strong developer activity and their positions as neutral infrastructure layers. At the same time, he warned that several newer chains, particularly those closely tied to financial services and consumer-facing fintech use cases, may fail to live up to the excitement surrounding them. While these projects have attracted attention for focusing on areas such as payments, stablecoins, and real-world assets, Qureshi expects their on-chain activity metrics, including daily active users and transaction flows, to disappoint. He said the best developers are still likely to concentrate on established, open platforms rather than networks that are more tightly associated with specific companies or business models. As a result, Ethereum and Solana could very well continue to attract talent and usage, while some newer chains struggle to convert early interest into lasting traction. Qureshi also made a broader prediction about corporate adoption, wherein he said that 2026 could be a turning point for crypto’s relationship with Big Tech. He expects that at least one major technology company, such as Google, Apple, or Meta, will either launch its own crypto wallet or acquire an existing one. According to Qureshi, such a move would essentially indicate that crypto wallets are becoming a standard part of digital financial infrastructure rather than a niche product for enthusiasts. He also added that more Fortune 100 companies are likely to begin using blockchain rails as well, particularly in the banking and fintech sectors. However, this adoption will not be evenly spread across all networks, and instead will concentrate around a smaller number of well-supported blockchain frameworks.

In 2028, Floki Inu is predicted to reach a maximum price of $0.000359. FLOKI price can reach a maximum level of $0.000583 and an average trading price of $0.000560 in 2031. Floki Inu is a meme coin driven by its community, the Floki Vikings. Inspired by Shiba Inu, Floki Inu aims to democratize power in the crypto space, pivoting the crypto market away from traditional financial entities. The Floki project ecosystem is diverse. It includes Valhalla, a blockchain combat game that rewards players with Floki tokens, and Floki Places, a store for merchandise and NFTs where purchases can be made using Floki tokens. Additionally, Floki University provides educational resources on the cryptocurrency market and blockchain technology. The launch (June 30, 2025) of the Valhalla mainnet of opBNB, coupled with DeFi partnerships like Chainlink, collectively enhances Floki Inu’s value and future potential by driving demand and expanding its use. Having attained its all-time high of $0.0003462 on June 5, 2024, can FLOKI reach $1?

Momentum loss favors consolidation, not immediate upside. A break above $0.0000425 or below $0.000038 will decide the next price direction. FLOKI on the daily timeframe On the daily timeframe for December 31, FLOKI is trading around $0.0000400, still capped beneath the declining mid-band near $0.0000413 and well below the upper Bollinger band around $0.0000455, confirming the broader bearish structure remains intact. FLOKIUSDT 1-day price chart by TradingView The sharp selloff earlier in the month pushed the price toward $0.0000370, which is now acting as a key demand floor. FLOKI’s price has since gone sideways, showing loss of downside momentum but no convincing reversal. The MACD remains slightly negative, although the histogram contraction suggests that selling pressure is fading rather than aggressively expanding. Unless FLOKI can reclaim $0.000042–$0.000043, rallies are likely corrective. A daily close below $0.000038 would reopen downside risk. FLOKI on the 4-hour timeframe On the 4-hour chart, price is compressing tightly around $0.0000400, aligning closely with the Alligator averages, which signals a neutral, non-trending phase. Recent higher lows from $0.0000390 hint at mild accumulation, supported by CMF holding above zero near 0.05, but upside follow-through remains weak as price repeatedly stalls near $0.0000410–$0.0000420. FLOKIUSDT 4-hour price chart by TradingView This structure favors range continuation rather than a breakout. Bulls need a clean push and hold above $0.0000425 to shift momentum, while a failure to defend $0.0000390 would likely drag the price back toward the daily support zone.

The market is coiling between $0.000038 and $0.000042, and a break from this range will define the next significant move. Is Floki Inu a good investment? FLOKI INU could be a big win or a big loss. It’s backed by a strong Floki community and consistent ecosystem developments, which can drive short-and long-term gains. But it’s risky, with price swings and unclear long-term value. Only invest if you’re comfortable with the risk. Will FLOKI reach $0.001? Expert analysis suggests that the $0.001 price point is achievable, provided utility grows and investor interest increases enough to drive FLOKI up ~11x its current market cap. Will Floki reach $0.01? FLOKI would need a market cap of up to $95 to $100 billion to hit $0.01, over 95x its current value. Only the top six cryptos have surpassed this level, making it a major challenge without massive growth in adoption and demand. While possible, it’s unlikely in the short term. Does FLOKI have a good long-term future? According to expert analysis, FLOKI has a promising long-term future with consistent growth potential. The coin could reach up to $0.002 within the decade.

FLOKI historic price sentiment Floki Inu price history by Coingecko From late 2021 to 2023, Floki experienced significant volatility. After reaching an all-time high of $0.0003437 in late 2021, prices fluctuated throughout 2022, ranging from $0.0001004 to $0.0005815.

Sentiment remains cautious, even with some modest gains across the major tokens. The Fear and Greed Index is still hovering at 32, firmly in “fear” territory. At the same time, the Altcoin Season Index at 20 suggests it’s still all about Bitcoin dominance rather than anyone having much appetite for risk. The total crypto market capitalisation is steady at around $2.98 trillion, while the 30-day trading volume is stuck at $88.9 billion. This situation is saying that the market is not panicking – but it’s not exactly confident enough to go chasing after higher prices either. Prenetics Ends Bitcoin Buying, Keeps 510 BTC Treasury Prenetics Global Limited has announced it’s stopping its daily Bitcoin buying and won’t put any more money into BTC anytime soon. The company says it will retain that 510 BTC as a treasury reserve but redirect its cash to scale its fast-growing consumer health brand, IM8. Management said the shift is due to IM8’s rapid growth, with ARR now over $100 million in just 11 months. It projects revenue of $180-200 million for 2026, has a cash hoard of over $70 million, and zero debt, which is a pretty impressive financial situation all things considered. It’s worth noting that this reduces one of the sources of extra money that corporations have been putting into Bitcoin. Still, it also highlights that more and more public companies are treating Bitcoin as a strategic reserve rather than trading it in the market. Bitcoin Technical Structure Signals Compression, Not Weakness On the 4-hour chart, Bitcoin price prediction stays neutral as BTC continues to coil inside a symmetrical triangle that has been forming since the rejection from the $94,000–$95,000 zone. A descending trendline caps lower highs, while higher lows are rising from a mid-December base near $83,500, placing the price in a clear decision zone. Candlestick behavior supports consolidation rather than stress. Repeated spinning tops and Doji candles point to equilibrium, and there has been no follow-through after bearish sessions. Bitcoin Price Chart – Source: Tradingview The 50-EMA and 100-EMA have flattened and converged near $88,200–$88,400, reinforcing the compression narrative. RSI is oscillating around 50–53, with a subtle bullish divergence versus the December low. Bitcoin Price Outlook: Break Above $90K Could Reset Momentum As long as Bitcoin holds above $85,100, the triangle structure remains intact. Using a measured move projection, a confirmed breakout above $90,000 opens the path toward $92,200, followed by a retest of $94,600. A clean resolution above that zone would shift focus toward $98,000–$100,000 into early 2026. PEPENODE: A Mine-to-Earn Meme Coin Nearing Presale Close PEPENODE is gaining momentum as a next-generation meme coin that blends viral culture with interactive gameplay. With over $2.47 mn raised and the presale approaching its cap, interest is building fast as the countdown enters its final stretch. What makes PEPENODE stand out is its mine-to-earn virtual ecosystem. Instead of passive holding, users can build digital server rooms using Miner Nodes and facilities, earning simulated rewards through a visual dashboard. The concept brings gamification and competition into the meme coin space, giving holders something to do before launch. The project also offers presale staking, allowing early participants to earn boosted rewards ahead of the token generation event. Leaderboards and bonus incentives are planned post-launch to keep engagement high. With 1 $PEPENODE priced at $0.0012161 and limited allocation remaining, the presale is entering its final opportunity window for early buyers.

This forecast comes not from speculative futurism but from two decades of pattern recognition in venture capital investing. Callaghan’s firm, which manages approximately $6 billion across multiple funds, has consistently identified paradigm shifts before they become mainstream trends. Their track record includes early investments in Fitbit, Ring, and Peloton—companies that redefined how humans interact with technology. Now, True Ventures places its next major bet on what comes after the smartphone era. The Smartphone Future: Why Current Interfaces Must Evolve Callaghan presents a compelling argument about smartphone limitations. He describes current mobile devices as “lousy interfaces” between humans and intelligence. The process of removing phones from pockets, unlocking screens, and typing messages represents significant friction in human-computer interaction. Furthermore, smartphones frequently disrupt natural social interactions and daily workflows. Market data supports this perspective: global smartphone growth has slowed to approximately 2% annually, indicating market saturation. Meanwhile, wearable technology segments demonstrate double-digit growth rates. This divergence suggests consumers increasingly seek more integrated, less intrusive technological interfaces. True Ventures’ Pattern Recognition Methodology The firm’s investment philosophy centers on identifying fundamental behavioral shifts rather than chasing technological trends. True Ventures maintains disciplined capital allocation, typically investing $3-6 million for 15-20% ownership in seed-stage companies. This approach contrasts sharply with the current AI investment landscape, where startups frequently raise hundreds of millions at billion-dollar valuations. Callaghan emphasizes that True Ventures prioritizes working with founders who share their long-term vision. The firm’s portfolio includes 63 successful exits and seven IPOs from approximately 300 companies over twenty years. Remarkably, three of their four recent 2025 exits involved repeat founders returning to collaborate with True Ventures again. The Behavioral Investment Thesis True Ventures’ most successful investments share a common characteristic: they enable new human behaviors rather than simply introducing new gadgets. The firm invested in Fitbit when wearable fitness trackers seemed niche. They backed Peloton after hundreds of other venture capitalists declined the opportunity. They supported Ring when even “Shark Tank” judges rejected the concept. Each investment appeared questionable initially but ultimately succeeded by creating new behavioral patterns. Callaghan summarizes this philosophy with his Peloton insight: “It’s not about the bike.” The hardware merely enables the behavior and community that consumers truly value. Sandbar: The Latest Manifestation of Interface Evolution The most recent embodiment of True Ventures’ interface thesis is Sandbar, a hardware device described as a “thought companion.” This voice-activated ring, worn on the index finger, serves a singular purpose: capturing and organizing thoughts through voice notes. Unlike multipurpose devices like the Humane AI Pin or health-focused wearables like Oura, Sandbar specializes in one fundamental human need. The device connects to an application that leverages artificial intelligence to process captured thoughts. Founders Mina Fahmi and Kirak Hong previously collaborated on neural interfaces at CTRL-Labs, which Meta acquired in 2019. Their expertise in brain-computer interfaces informed Sandbar’s development philosophy. True Ventures’ Interface Evolution Investments Company Investment Era Interface Innovation Behavioral Shift Fitbit Early Wearables Activity Tracking Quantified Self-Movement Peloton Connected Fitness Interactive Exercise Community-Driven Workouts Ring Smart Home Video Doorbell Remote Property Monitoring Sandbar Post-Smartphone Thought Capture Seamless Idea Documentation The AI Landscape and Interface Opportunities Callaghan acknowledges artificial intelligence represents the most significant computing wave in decades. He believes OpenAI could achieve trillion-dollar valuation status. However, he expresses concern about the capital intensity of current AI infrastructure development. Hyperscalers project $5 trillion in capital expenditure for data centers and chips. Callaghan identifies warning signs in circular financing arrangements supporting this infrastructure buildout. Despite these concerns, he remains optimistic about value creation opportunities at the application layer. New interfaces will leverage AI capabilities to enable previously impossible behaviors. The greatest innovations will emerge where artificial intelligence meets intuitive human-computer interaction. Market Validation Through Wearable Adoption Multiple market indicators validate the shift toward alternative interfaces. Consider these developments: Smartwatch penetration has increased from 14% to 35% among US adults since 2019 Smart ring shipments grew 42% year-over-year in 2024 Voice assistant usage now exceeds 50% among smartphone owners for specific tasks Enterprise adoption of wearable technology increased 28% in manufacturing and logistics sectors Investment Implications and Industry Transformation The transition from smartphones to alternative interfaces carries significant implications for technology investors and entrepreneurs. Callaghan emphasizes that successful early-stage investing should feel “scary and lonely.” Founders pursuing genuine innovation often face skepticism before achieving validation. True Ventures maintains its focus on seed-stage investments despite market pressures to pursue larger, later-stage opportunities. The firm’s measured approach extends to fund size—Callaghan questions why venture firms need billions when meaningful innovation requires thoughtful capital rather than excessive funding. This philosophy positions True Ventures to identify interface innovations that larger, momentum-driven investors might overlook. Conclusion The smartphone future appears increasingly uncertain as alternative interfaces gain traction. Jon Callaghan’s prediction of smartphone obsolescence within a decade stems from two decades of pattern recognition in human-computer interaction evolution. True Ventures’ investment thesis centers on enabling new behaviors through intuitive interfaces rather than incremental improvements to existing devices. Market data supports this perspective, showing slowing smartphone growth alongside accelerating wearable adoption. As artificial intelligence capabilities advance, the interface layer represents the next frontier for technological innovation. The transition from smartphones to more natural interaction methods will redefine how humans communicate, work, and think. This evolution promises to make technology more integrated into daily life while becoming less intrusive—a paradox that ventures like Sandbar aim to resolve through specialized, behavior-focused design. FAQs Q1: What evidence supports the claim that smartphones will become obsolete? Market data shows smartphone growth has slowed to approximately 2% annually while wearable technology segments experience double-digit growth. Additionally, consumer behavior indicates increasing preference for less intrusive interfaces that integrate more seamlessly into daily activities. Q2: How does True Ventures identify promising interface innovations? The firm focuses on technologies that enable new human behaviors rather than simply introducing new gadgets. They seek founders with compelling visions for how humans might interact with technology more naturally, often investing before market trends become apparent. Q3: What distinguishes Sandbar from other wearable devices? Sandbar specializes exclusively in thought capture through voice notes, unlike multipurpose devices. Its design philosophy prioritizes doing one thing exceptionally well—addressing what Callaghan describes as a “fundamental human behavioral need missing from technology today.” Q4: How does artificial intelligence factor into interface evolution? AI enables more natural, context-aware interactions between humans and technology. As AI capabilities advance, interfaces can become more intuitive, predictive, and personalized, reducing the cognitive load currently associated with smartphone interactions. Q5: What timeline does Callaghan propose for smartphone transition? He suggests smartphones will see significantly different usage patterns within five years and could become largely obsolete within a decade. This transition will likely occur gradually as alternative interfaces prove more effective for specific use cases.

Bitcoin Coinbase Premium Gap Has Plunged In a new post on X, CryptoQuant community analyst Maartunn has talked about the latest trend in the Bitcoin Coinbase Premium Gap. This indicator keeps track of the difference between the BTCUSD price on Coinbase and BTCUSDT price on Binance. Related Reading: Bitcoin Retail Optimism Returns To End 2025—What Usually Follows? Coinbase is mainly used by traders in the US, especially the large institutional entities, while Binance hosts a global traffic. As such, the Coinbase Premium Gap reflects the difference in behavior between American and offshore whales. When the value of the metric is greater than zero, it means the asset is trading at a higher value on Coinbase than Binance. Such a trend implies users of the former are applying a higher amount of buying pressure (or lower amount of selling pressure) as compared to the userbase of the latter. On the other hand, the indicator being negative suggests Binance may be observing a higher amount of accumulation as the cryptocurrency is going for a higher price on the platform. Now, here is the chart shared by Maartunn that shows the trend in the Bitcoin Coinbase Premium Gap over the last year and a half: As displayed in the above graph, the Bitcoin Coinbase Premium Gap has fallen into the negative territory recently, implying the American investors have shifted their behavior to one of higher selling pressure/lower buying pressure. In other words, demand from US traders has gone down. Currently, the indicator is sitting at a value of -$122, which means the cryptocurrency’s price is trading at a discount of $122 on Coinbase relative to Binance. The last time that the metric fell to such a low level was during the price crash in November. In recent times, US institutional entities have played an impactful role in the market, so the Coinbase Premium Gap, which acts a proxy of their behavior, has tended to have some correlation with the asset’s spot price. This pattern was once again seen in November, when a drawdown occurred in the cryptocurrency alongside a plunge into the red zone for the metric. So far, Bitcoin has managed to be relatively stable even with the low demand from the American whales, but it only remains to be seen how long that will continue, given the scale of the discount on Coinbase. Related Reading: Bitcoin Equilibrium: Active Market Participants Just Breaking Even The current value of the Coinbase Premium Gap is one of the lowest in the last 18 months, being seen on only five occasions in this window.

South Korea’s Digital Assets Act Delayed On Tuesday, local news outlets reported that South Korea’s Second Phase of the Virtual Asset User Protection Act will be delayed until next year as financial authorities continue to clash over stablecoin issuance-related legislation. According to Yonhap News Agency, financial circles and the National Assembly shared on December 30 that the main policies of the crypto framework have been largely decided. Notably, the Financial Services Commission (FSC)’s draft is expected to include investor protection measures such as no-fault liability for crypto asset operators and isolation of bankruptcy risks for stablecoin issuers. As part of investor protection measures, stablecoin issuers will likely be required to manage reserve assets in deposits and government bonds. In addition, they will be required to deposit or entrust at least 100% of the issuance amount with custodians such as banks. The bill could also require crypto asset operators to comply with disclosure obligations as well as terms and conditions. Moreover, it may “impose strict liability for damages on digital asset operators in accordance with the Electronic Financial Transactions Act in cases of hacking or computer system failures.” It will seemingly address allowing the sale of domestic crypto assets, subject to sufficient disclosure of information. Despite this, the key issues remain unresolved, suggesting that the final submission deadline will likely be pushed to the start of 2026. Stablecoin Issuance Dispute Continues As reported by Bitcoinist, the Financial Services Commission failed to submit the highly anticipated Digital Assets Act, which is expected to address the issuance and distribution of Korean won (KRW)-pegged stablecoins. The financial regulator did not meet the December 10 deadline set by the South Korean ruling party to submit the government’s legislation to the National Policy Committee. The bill was delayed after the FSC and the Bank of Korea (BOK) were unable to resolve their differences over the issuance of won-denominated stablecoins nearly three weeks ago. The financial authorities have been debating this issue for months, with reports in November suggesting that the long-awaited legislation, which was expected to be approved at the end of this year, risked being delayed. The FSC and the BOK disagree on the extent of banks’ role despite agreeing that financial institutions must be involved in the issuance of won-pegged tokens. The central bank has pushed for a consortium of banks owning at least 51% of any stablecoin issuer seeking approval in the country. Meanwhile, the FSC has shared concerns that giving a majority stake to banks could reduce participation from tech firms and limit the market’s innovation. Yonhap News Agency highlighted that the financial authorities also face other disagreements, including the initial capital requirements for stablecoin issuers, with opinions ranging from 500 million to 25 billion won, and whether to separate the stablecoin issuance and distribution functions of exchanges. An FSC official reportedly asserted that they are “currently in the process of gradually narrowing the differences in positions with the relevant agencies,” while “discussing all possibilities with an open mind.” The report also noted that the ruling party’s Digital Asset Task Force (TF) is allegedly preparing its own version of the bill, based on the legislative proposals submitted by lawmakers. Notably, recent reports affirmed that the government’s proposal should be announced by early next month at the latest, as the integrated bill must be submitted in January 2026.",Crypto News|Bank of Korea|bitcoin|btc|BTCUSDT|crypto framework|Crypto legislation|Financial Services Commission (FSC)|South Korea authorities|stablecoin bill|Stablecoin Issuers,EN,0,0,ASIA|FIAT|REGULATION|MACROECONOMICS|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-12-31 06:00:46

The cryptocurrency exchange’s Chief Policy Officer, Faryar Shirzad, asserts that the United States risks falling behind China if policymakers prohibit or limit interest payments on stablecoins. This warning comes as China advances its digital yuan program with interest-bearing capabilities, potentially reshaping global financial competition. The stablecoin interest policy debate now represents a critical inflection point for American financial innovation. Stablecoin Interest Policy: The New Frontier in Global Financial Competition The global competition for digital finance supremacy has entered a decisive phase. China’s central bank recently issued guidelines permitting interest payments on digital yuan wallets. Consequently, this development signals a strategic shift in central bank digital currency (CBDC) implementation. Meanwhile, the United States continues debating stablecoin regulation through proposed legislation like the CLARITY Act. The divergence between these approaches could determine which nation leads the next generation of financial systems. Faryar Shirzad emphasizes the urgency of this moment. “China’s decision marks the beginning of a global digital money race,” he stated. “The U.S. can no longer delay decisions on allowing interest payments.” His comments highlight how technological innovation intersects with regulatory frameworks. Furthermore, they underscore the competitive pressures reshaping international finance. The Digital Yuan’s Strategic Advancements China’s digital currency electronic payment (DCEP) system represents a comprehensive CBDC implementation. The People’s Bank of China (PBOC) has systematically developed this infrastructure since 2014. Recent guidelines now permit interest payments on digital yuan holdings. This feature creates several strategic advantages: Enhanced Adoption Incentives: Interest payments encourage broader digital yuan usage Monetary Policy Tool: Direct interest rate application to digital currency Financial Inclusion: Banking services accessible without traditional accounts Cross-Border Efficiency: Streamlined international transactions with programmable features The digital yuan’s interest-bearing capability represents a significant innovation. It transforms CBDCs from simple digital cash to sophisticated financial instruments. This evolution challenges existing dollar dominance in international trade and finance. Comparative Analysis: US and China Approaches The following table illustrates key differences between American and Chinese approaches to digital currency interest policies: Aspect United States Approach China Approach Primary Focus Private sector stablecoin regulation Central bank digital currency development Interest Policy Status Under debate in Congress Implemented for digital yuan Regulatory Framework Multiple agencies with overlapping jurisdiction Centralized under People’s Bank of China Implementation Timeline Legislation pending since 2022 Pilot programs since 2020, expanding nationally International Strategy Maintaining existing dollar dominance Creating alternative international settlement system The CLARITY Act and American Regulatory Challenges The Crypto-Asset Reporting, Innovation, and Technology Act (CLARITY Act) represents America’s primary legislative response. This comprehensive bill addresses multiple aspects of cryptocurrency regulation. However, it remains silent on specific interest payment provisions for stablecoins. This omission creates uncertainty for financial innovators and investors alike. Congressional negotiations continue shaping the final legislation. Multiple committees claim jurisdiction over different aspects of digital asset regulation. Consequently, this fragmented approach slows decision-making. Meanwhile, other nations advance their digital currency strategies with greater coordination. Financial technology experts express concern about this regulatory lag. Dr. Sarah Johnson, a Georgetown University fintech researcher, explains the implications. “Interest-bearing digital currencies create new monetary policy transmission channels,” she notes. “Delaying decisions on this front cedes strategic ground to competitors.” Her analysis highlights the technical sophistication underlying seemingly simple interest payment features. Global Implications of Digital Currency Competition The stablecoin interest policy debate extends beyond national borders. International financial systems face potential restructuring based on digital currency adoption patterns. Several key implications emerge from this competition: Reserve Currency Status: Digital dollar alternatives could challenge traditional dominance Payment System Architecture: New infrastructures bypassing SWIFT networks Financial Surveillance: Differing approaches to privacy and transaction monitoring Developing Nation Adoption: Countries may align with whichever system offers better terms These implications demonstrate why Coinbase’s warning carries significant weight. The stablecoin interest policy decision affects America’s position in global finance. It also influences technological innovation within financial services more broadly. Historical Context and Future Projections Digital currency development follows decades of financial innovation. The 2008 financial crisis accelerated interest in alternative systems. Bitcoin’s creation that same year demonstrated decentralized possibilities. Subsequently, stablecoins emerged as bridge assets between traditional and digital finance. Central banks initially viewed cryptocurrencies with skepticism. However, China’s 2014 digital currency research initiative changed this dynamic. Other nations recognized the strategic importance of CBDCs. Currently, over 130 countries explore digital currency options according to International Monetary Fund data. Future projections suggest several possible outcomes. The United States might maintain leadership through regulatory clarity and innovation. Alternatively, fragmented regulation could push development offshore. China’s centralized approach offers different advantages and challenges. The coming years will determine which model proves more effective internationally. Industry Perspectives and Economic Impacts Financial institutions closely monitor stablecoin interest policy developments. Banking organizations recognize both threats and opportunities. Traditional banks face potential disintermediation from interest-bearing digital currencies. However, they also see partnership possibilities with regulated stablecoin issuers. Investment firms analyze the macroeconomic implications. Interest-bearing digital currencies could alter savings behavior and capital allocation. They might also influence monetary policy effectiveness in different economic conditions. These complex interactions require careful study and regulatory consideration. Consumer advocacy groups emphasize different concerns. They focus on protection mechanisms for digital currency holders. Interest payments raise questions about insurance coverage and risk disclosure. These consumer protection aspects must accompany any interest-bearing digital currency framework. Conclusion The stablecoin interest policy debate represents a critical moment for American financial leadership. Coinbase’s warning highlights the competitive pressures from China’s digital yuan advancements. The United States faces a clear choice between embracing financial innovation or risking diminished global influence. Congressional action on the CLARITY Act will signal America’s direction in the digital finance race. Ultimately, decisions made in coming months could determine financial system architecture for decades. The stablecoin interest policy question therefore demands urgent and thoughtful resolution. FAQs Q1: What exactly are interest payments on stablecoins? Interest payments on stablecoins refer to yield or returns paid to holders of these digital assets, similar to interest earned in savings accounts. These payments typically come from reserves or lending activities backing the stablecoins. Q2: Why does China allowing interest on the digital yuan concern US policymakers? China’s interest-bearing digital yuan creates competitive advantages in digital finance adoption, potentially challenging dollar dominance in international trade and giving China first-mover advantages in CBDC technology and standards. Q3: What is the CLARITY Act mentioned in the article? The Crypto-Asset Reporting, Innovation, and Technology Act (CLARITY Act) is proposed US legislation that would establish comprehensive regulatory frameworks for digital assets, including stablecoins, but currently lacks specific provisions addressing interest payments. Q4: How might interest-bearing stablecoins affect traditional banking? Interest-bearing stablecoins could compete with traditional savings accounts, potentially drawing deposits away from banks and creating disintermediation risks unless banks integrate these technologies into their offerings. Q5: What are the main arguments against allowing interest on stablecoins? Opponents cite concerns about financial stability risks, potential bank runs, regulatory complexity, consumer protection challenges, and possible circumvention of existing banking regulations designed to maintain system stability.

This comes as precious metals were the standout performers among commodities this year, with silver outperforming most major equity indexes and currencies. At the same time, gold reached record highs due to economic and geopolitical risks. Tesla CEO Elon Musk criticized the move on his social media platform X, responding to a post about the upcoming restrictions. “This is not good. Silver is needed in many industrial processes,” he wrote. However, the rules are not new. China’s Commerce Ministry first announced the measures in October to strengthen oversight of rare metals, coinciding with a meeting between U.S. President Donald Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping in South Korea. At that time, Beijing agreed to a one-year pause on certain rare earth export controls, while the U.S. rolled back tariffs. At the beginning of December, China published a list of 44 companies approved to export silver under the new measures in 2026 and 2027. The 2026 regulations also tightened the export of tungsten and antimony, materials that are dominated by China’s supply chain and are widely used in defense and advanced technologies. Even though China hasn’t officially imposed a blanket ban on silver exports, the state-run Securities Times said on Tuesday that an unnamed industry insider stated the new policy formally elevates the metal from an ordinary commodity to a strategic material, placing its export controls on the same regulatory footing as those for rare earths. Precious metals surge as investors flee the weakening U.S. dollar A November flash survey by the EU Chamber of Commerce in China found that most members have already been, or expect to be, affected by these export restrictions. In November, the U.S. added silver to its nationally designated list of critical minerals , highlighting its importance in electrical circuits, batteries, solar cells, and anti-bacterial medical instruments. Another U.S. analysis stated that China was one of the world’s largest producers of silver in 2024 and also home to one of the largest silver reserves. China exported more than 4,600 tons of silver in the first 11 months of the year, significantly exceeding the roughly 220 tons of imports during that period, according to Wind Information, which cited official figures. The restrictions on silver come just as interest in the metal has increased in recent weeks. Two Chinese firms reached out to Canada-based Kuya Silver on Friday, offering to buy physical silver at about $8 more than the market price at the time, CEO David Stein confirmed. According to him, one company was a manufacturer while the other was a large trading firm. Stein added that an Indian buyer approached Kuya on Monday with an offer $10 above the market price. Separately, a column in The Free Press on Tuesday by George Mason University economics professor Tyler Cowen suggested that the surge in silver and gold prices reflects investors moving away from the U.S. dollar. He called the surge in prices “a flashing warning for the [U.S.] economy.” The U.S. dollar index has plunged by almost 9.5% in 2025, its worst performance in 8 years. Global buyers offer premiums amid growing silver demand In comparison, silver has more than doubled in price this year, on track for its strongest annual gain since 1979, when it soared nearly 470%. Prices pulled back on Wednesday after hitting a record above $80 an ounce earlier in the week, with spot silver last trading around $73. Gold has risen over 60% so far in 2025, also positioning itself for its best year since 1979. Bitcoin, often promoted as a gold alternative, traded near $88,000 Wednesday morning Beijing time, down more than 5% for the year.

This decisive action represents the latest escalation in South Korea’s aggressive regulatory campaign targeting virtual asset service providers, signaling a new era of enforcement rigor that could reshape the entire Asian cryptocurrency landscape. Korbit’s Compliance Breakdown: A Detailed Analysis The Financial Intelligence Unit, operating under South Korea’s Financial Services Commission, identified approximately 22,000 separate violations across multiple compliance categories. These failures represent a comprehensive breakdown of Korbit’s regulatory obligations. Specifically, the FIU documented violations in customer due diligence procedures and transaction restriction protocols. Furthermore, investigators discovered 19 separate transactions with unregistered overseas virtual asset service providers. Additionally, Korbit failed to conduct mandatory money laundering risk assessments before listing new digital assets. The regulatory examination revealed systemic weaknesses in Korbit’s compliance framework. For instance, the exchange neglected proper customer identification procedures in thousands of cases. Moreover, transaction monitoring systems failed to flag suspicious activities appropriately. Consequently, these deficiencies created substantial vulnerabilities within South Korea’s financial ecosystem. The Financial Services Commission emphasized that such lapses undermine the integrity of the entire virtual asset market. South Korea’s Evolving Crypto Regulatory Landscape South Korea has progressively tightened cryptocurrency regulations since implementing the Special Financial Transactions Information Act in March 2021. This legislation established comprehensive requirements for virtual asset service providers. Specifically, it mandated strict anti-money laundering protocols and customer verification procedures. Additionally, the Act required exchanges to maintain real-name verification partnerships with domestic banks. Furthermore, it imposed reporting obligations for suspicious transactions exceeding specific thresholds. The Korbit enforcement action follows several high-profile regulatory interventions. For example, the Financial Services Commission previously suspended operations at several smaller exchanges in 2021. Similarly, regulators imposed significant penalties on other platforms for compliance shortcomings. These consistent enforcement patterns demonstrate South Korea’s commitment to financial system integrity. Moreover, they reflect growing international coordination on cryptocurrency regulation standards. Recent South Korean Crypto Enforcement Actions Exchange Year Violation Penalty Korbit 2024 AML/CDD failures 2.73B won fine Multiple exchanges 2021 Registration issues Business suspension Bithumb 2020 Data protection Financial penalty Expert Analysis: The Compliance Imperative Financial regulation experts emphasize the broader implications of this enforcement action. According to industry analysts, the Korbit penalty establishes several important precedents. First, it demonstrates regulators’ willingness to impose substantial financial penalties for compliance failures. Second, it highlights the importance of executive accountability in cryptocurrency operations. Third, it signals increased scrutiny of relationships with overseas service providers. Compliance professionals note that cryptocurrency exchanges must prioritize several key areas: Enhanced Due Diligence: Implement robust customer identification and verification systems Transaction Monitoring: Develop sophisticated systems to detect suspicious activities Risk Assessment: Conduct thorough evaluations before listing new assets International Compliance: Verify registration status of overseas partners Executive Oversight: Ensure leadership accountability for compliance programs Executive Accountability and Industry Impact The Financial Intelligence Unit extended disciplinary actions beyond institutional penalties. Specifically, regulators issued a formal caution to Korbit’s Chief Executive Officer. Additionally, they delivered an official reprimand to the Chief Compliance Officer. These personal sanctions represent a significant development in regulatory enforcement philosophy. Consequently, they establish clear expectations for executive responsibility in cryptocurrency enterprises. Industry observers anticipate several immediate impacts from this enforcement action. First, other cryptocurrency exchanges will likely review and strengthen their compliance programs. Second, investors may become more selective about platform security and regulatory adherence. Third, international regulators might reference this case in their own enforcement approaches. Finally, compliance technology providers could experience increased demand for advanced monitoring solutions. Global Regulatory Context and Future Implications South Korea’s enforcement action occurs within a broader global regulatory trend. International organizations like the Financial Action Task Force have advocated for consistent cryptocurrency regulations worldwide. Many jurisdictions have responded with enhanced regulatory frameworks. For instance, the European Union implemented comprehensive Markets in Crypto-Assets regulations. Similarly, Singapore strengthened its Payment Services Act governing digital asset providers. The Korbit case demonstrates several emerging regulatory priorities. First, authorities increasingly focus on cross-border transaction monitoring. Second, regulators emphasize proactive risk assessment rather than reactive compliance. Third, enforcement agencies target both institutional and individual accountability. These trends suggest cryptocurrency exchanges must adopt more sophisticated compliance strategies. Moreover, they indicate regulators will continue aggressive enforcement campaigns. Conclusion South Korea’s Financial Intelligence Unit has delivered a decisive enforcement message through its $2 million fine against Korbit for compliance failures. This action underscores the critical importance of robust anti-money laundering systems in cryptocurrency exchanges. Furthermore, it establishes clear expectations for executive accountability in virtual asset enterprises. The regulatory landscape continues evolving rapidly, with South Korea positioning itself as a global leader in cryptocurrency oversight. Consequently, exchanges must prioritize comprehensive compliance programs to maintain operational legitimacy and protect financial system integrity. The Korbit penalty serves as a stark reminder that regulatory adherence represents not merely a legal obligation but a fundamental component of sustainable cryptocurrency operations. FAQs Q1: What specific violations did Korbit commit according to South Korea’s FIU? The Financial Intelligence Unit identified approximately 22,000 violations including failures in customer due diligence procedures, transaction restriction protocols, 19 transactions with unregistered overseas virtual asset service providers, and inadequate money laundering risk assessments before listing new assets. Q2: How does this enforcement action fit into South Korea’s broader cryptocurrency regulatory approach? This penalty represents the latest escalation in South Korea’s aggressive regulatory campaign following the 2021 Special Financial Transactions Information Act implementation, demonstrating consistent enforcement patterns and commitment to financial system integrity. Q3: What personal consequences did Korbit executives face from this enforcement action? Regulators issued a formal caution to Korbit’s Chief Executive Officer and delivered an official reprimand to the Chief Compliance Officer, establishing clear expectations for executive responsibility in cryptocurrency enterprises. Q4: How might this enforcement action affect other cryptocurrency exchanges operating in South Korea? Industry analysts anticipate other exchanges will review and strengthen compliance programs, while investors may become more selective about platform security, and compliance technology providers could experience increased demand. Q5: What global regulatory trends does the Korbit enforcement action reflect? This case aligns with international regulatory priorities including cross-border transaction monitoring, proactive risk assessment, individual accountability, and follows similar regulatory strengthening in the European Union and Singapore.

This renewed focus follows a combination of factors, including rising ETF interest and greater regulatory clarity, which some commentators believe could support stronger demand over time. Market commentator Moonshilla is among those expressing this view, suggesting that XRP may be positioning itself for a substantial upward repricing under these conditions. Along similar lines, YoungHoon Kim has argued that the same structural shifts could allow XRP to approach $100 within the next 5 years. Although these perspectives have attracted attention, they have also raise d questions about feasibility, particularly in light of XRP’s large supply and the scale of valuation required to support such a price level. Is XRP to $100 Feasible? To address this question, ChatGPT examined whether $100 per XRP is realistic given the token’s supply. XRP has a maximum supply of 100 billion tokens, with approximately 60.57 billion currently in circulation. At $100, XRP would require a market capitalization of $10 trillion at full supply, and roughly $6.05 trillion at the current circulating supply. Both figures would exceed Bitcoin’s current valuation of about $1.77 trillion and surpass the market value of major global corporations such as Nvidia, Apple, Alphabet, Microsoft, and Amazon. While some community members argue that XRP’s utility in payments and settlements could justify higher valuations, ChatGPT took a more restrained view. The model noted that even huge transaction volumes do not automatically translate into sustained price repricing. Instead, it emphasized that multiple conditions would need to occur simultaneously. These include broad use of XRP by global financial institutions as a primary settlement layer, meaningful reductions in available supply, and significant expansion of the total digital asset market. As a result, the model concluded that while a $100 XRP price is mathematically possible, it remains improbable under current structural conditions, primarily due to the size of the supply and the huge valuation such a price would require. That’s Why You Need This 100x Coin As highlighted, the conditions for XRP to reach $100 make it unrealistic in the near term, if not in the future. Hence, for an average market user looking to become a millionaire this cycle, XRP may not be your best bet. On this basis, crypto users are turning to new altcoins tipped to rally extensively even in the current market uncertainty. Among the top coins that whales are buying, Minotaurus (MTAUR) has been one of the most promising. Why Just 10,000 MTAUR Can Be Life Changing At the current market price of over 0.000126 USDT , one can acquire 10,000 MTAUR for less than 10 USDT. Let’s assume that MTAUR hypothetically rallies 65,000% as XRP did from its all-time low; a 10 USDT purchase would turn into 6,510 USDT. Now, imagine buying 100 USDT, 1,000 USDT, or 10,000 USDT worth of MTAUR at the current price, and it allegedly mirrors XRP’s all-time rally. Such portfolio upsides would easily make one a millionaire. Buy MTAUR now or l earn more at minotaurus.io . Disclaimer: This is a sponsored press release for informational purposes only.

Bitcoin & Ethereum ETF Netflows Have Been Negative Recently As explained by CryptoQuant community analyst Maartunn in a new post on X, Bitcoin and Ethereum spot exchange-traded funds (ETFs) have faced a negative netflow over the past month. Spot ETFs are investment vehicles that allow investors to gain indirect exposure to an underlying asset’s price movements. In the context of cryptocurrencies, this means that an ETF investor never has to interact on-chain; the fund buys and custodies the tokens on their behalf. US spot ETFs are a relatively new phenomenon in the digital asset sector, only getting approval by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) in January 2024 for Bitcoin and July 2024 for Ethereum. Spot ETFs can look like a convenient mode of investing for traders unfamiliar with cryptocurrency wallets and exchanges. Institutional entities, in particular, prefer to gain exposure through them. Since their arrival, these investment vehicles have quickly gained popularity by tapping into this demand from the traditional investors and established themselves as one of the cornerstones of the sector. Below is a chart that shows how the 30-day netflows related to the Bitcoin and Ethereum spot ETFs have changed during their existence so far. As is visible in the graph, the 30-day spot ETF netflow has been negative for both Bitcoin and Ethereum since a while now, suggesting that the funds have been witnessing sustained net outflows. The situation has improved a bit most recently, but the indicator is still red for both assets, sitting at -$656 million for BTC and -$422 million for ETH. The weak demand in the market is similar to the phase of outflows from the first half of 2025. Back then, demand eventually made an explosive return, with Bitcoin and Ethereum witnessing sharp price rallies. It now remains to be seen whether a comeback will happen this time or if the slowdown in demand is here to stay for now. Another relatively recent source of demand in the market is digital asset treasuries . As highlighted by institutional DeFi solutions provider Sentora in a new X post , holdings of cryptocurrency treasuries now exceed $185 billion across 368 entities. Out of this amount, 73% of the digital asset treasuries are controlled by companies, while the rest is in the hands of governments. BTC Price At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading around $88,100, unchanged from last week.",Bitcoin News|bitcoin|bitcoin ETFs|btc|BTCUSDT|ETH|Ethereum|Ethereum ETFs,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|ETH|TRADING|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-12-31 07:00:36

As we pivot toward 2026, the industry is asking: How will HTX Futures sustain this momentum? And what is the driving force behind the “Copy Trading 4.0” buzz? In the latest episode of Real Talk with HTX Executives, YOYO, Head of HTX Futures, addressed users directly to unpack the brand’s 2025 milestones and unveil the strategic blueprint for 2026. Copy Trading 4.0: A System-Level Product Rebuild Launched in 2023 and iterated throughout 2024, Copy Trading 4.0 saw breakout growth in late 2025. It is now recognized as the benchmark for HTX’s “human-centric” transformation. YOYO summarized this leap forward with three pillars: Enhanced User-Friendliness, Absolute Transparency, and Superior Security. The copy trading engine is now natively integrated into the core futures interface. This “develop once, deploy everywhere” architecture ensures that every new futures feature is instantly available to copy traders, drastically shortening the innovation cycle. For beginners, Smart Copy Mode removes the friction of complex configurations, allowing users to follow elite traders with balanced risk exposure. The system also offers a seamless “dual-identity” switch, letting users toggle between being a follower and a lead trader. To prevent position commingling, the system now utilizes independent capital pools for each followed trader. Furthermore, the migration from order-based to position-based logic provides a more intuitive, real-time overview of portfolio health. YOYO emphasized that 4.0 is not the finish line. The next phase involves integrating AI-driven strategies and expanding the elite trader ecosystem to ensure a sustainable, high-yield future for all participants. Annual Review: What Did HTX Futures Get Right in 2025? Looking back on the year soon coming to a close, YOYO described the trajectory of HTX Futures as one of “accumulative growth”. She revealed that the HTX Futures user base expanded by 2 to 3 times in 2025. According to YOYO, this growth was not fueled by short-term market tailwinds but was a natural outcome of users’ long-term trust in the platform. This trust is underpinned by two core strengths HTX has consistently reinforced over the year – its brand foundation and service capabilities. These strengths are increasingly being converted into sustainable, long-term competitive advantages for its futures business. Security and Risk Control: The Bedrock of Long-Term Trust First and foremost is HTX’s risk control and security system . For futures traders, security remains the single most critical factor in decision-making. YOYO noted that over the past 12 years, HTX has continuously strengthened and refined its risk-control system, building a comprehensive defense that spans user fund isolation, system stability, and resilience under extreme market conditions. Whether during the recent industry turbulence around October 11 or amid multiple periods of intense volatility earlier this year, HTX Futures experienced no major systemic risk incidents. Its proven resilience in maintaining stable operations through repeated real-world stress tests has become a fundamental pillar supporting long-term user trust. Liquidity Development: A Key Milestone for the Futures Business On liquidity, YOYO revealed that since April this year, HTX has achieved significant improvements in liquidity depth across major cryptocurrencies as well as selected secondary assets, with overall levels nearly doubling. This progress stands out as one of the most important developments for HTX Futures in 2025. She also admitted that there is still room for improvement in certain long-tail and trending assets. Moving forward, the team will continue to solidify the foundations of K2 and secondary assets while rolling out more diversified solutions to optimize liquidity across all assets. This capability, in turn, is set to become one of the most critical and enduring competitive moats of HTX’s futures business. Trading Speed and System Capabilities: Built for High-Frequency and Quantitative Traders For high-frequency and quantitative traders, execution speed and system performance are paramount. YOYO explained that in May 2025, HTX launched its Multi-Assets Collateral system, which not only supports cross-asset hedging strategies involving cryptocurrencies such as BTC and ETH but has also boosted API trading throughput by nearly fourfold. Today, a substantial portion of high-frequency quantitative trading activity on the platform has already migrated to this system. Meanwhile, the underlying matching infrastructure continues to undergo optimization. A brand-new matching engine is expected to go live in the first quarter of 2026, further enhancing the smoothness and stability of futures trading. A Financial Product Suite: Enhancing Capital Efficiency and User Retention While continuously strengthening its fundamental trading capabilities, HTX has steadily built out a more comprehensive financial product suite, now a key pillar for long-term user retention. Since the launch of SmartEarn in December 2024, HTX Futures has centered its efforts on enhancing capital utilization efficiency. Designed around low entry thresholds and flexible deposits and withdrawals, SmartEarn allows users to earn annualized yields simply by keeping funds in their USDT-M accounts. YOYO revealed that SmartEarn is set to undergo another major iteration in 2026. Without raising usage barriers, its annualized yield potential is expected to increase by 2–3 times. At the same time, HTX continues to upgrade both its grid trading and copy trading systems. The grid trading system was fully revamped in 2025, followed by the launch of Copy Trading 4.0 toward the end of the year. In 2026, the team will further ramp up investment in AI-powered strategy trading tools, including AI trading assistants and integrated strategy capabilities. It is dedicated to making proven, mature strategies accessible to users at a lower entry threshold, helping them pursue long-term, sustainable returns. YOYO emphasized that throughout its business growth, the HTX Futures team has remained committed to engaging directly with users, actively listening to authentic feedback across multiple channels, and using those insights as the primary engine for product optimization and iteration. This virtuous cycle has not only fostered increasingly deep user trust but has also become a solid foundation for business growth. At the same time, the team has consistently served every user with sincerity and dedication. Backed by strong group-level resource support for the futures business, it has become increasingly clear that the turnaround from user feedback to product iteration is getting faster. The Next Phase of Capacity Building for Futures Trading Looking ahead to 2026, the strategic direction of HTX Futures remains clear and focused – continuous product refinement, optimization of liquidity structures, improvements in capital efficiency, and deeper strengthening of risk-control frameworks to further solidify the foundational capabilities of the futures business. On this basis, an especially significant shift is now taking shape: exploring ways to return greater proactive risk-management control to users. In YOYO’s view, the platform’s responsibility extends beyond providing users with robust systems and baseline safety protections. Through product and mechanism design, it should also equip users with mature, clear, and actionable risk-management tools, enabling them to actively participate in managing their own trading risks with a full understanding of potential risks. This also means that, on top of existing system security and risk-control frameworks, HTX Futures will help users establish more transparent and controllable risk-management pathways, so that risk control is no longer a passive outcome, but an integral part of trading decision-making. Apparently, HTX Futures’ strategy goes beyond scale expansion, pointing instead toward a more mature trading infrastructure and a more clearly defined risk-management paradigm. From system-level product reconstruction to an evolution in risk-control philosophy, HTX Futures is seeking to answer a longer-term question: in a highly volatile crypto market, how can more users participate in futures trading in a more controlled, rational manner, and ultimately realize long-term value? This, perhaps, is where its true competitive edge in the next phase will lie.

Among them, ZBT topped the leaderboard with a 127% increase, underscoring the market’s renewed appetite for leading sectors. As 2025 draws to a close, sentiment across the crypto market continues to recover, with trading activity picking up alongside seasonal year-end momentum. A combination of macro tailwinds and renewed narrative catalysts has driven broad-based sector strength, as AI, privacy, and memecoin assets simultaneously rebound. Capital flows are increasingly gravitating toward high-growth narratives and thematically distinct opportunities. AI Narrative Returns to Center Stage as PAYAI and SQD Lead the Rally Artificial intelligence remains one of the defining long-term narratives of the 2025 crypto cycle, with accelerating real-world adoption driving a revaluation of application assets. One of the key catalysts behind this week’s AI-sector rebound was the official release of Version 2 of x402, an open-source payment protocol for AI agents developed by the Coinbase developer team. The upgraded x402 protocol introduces native multi-chain support, covering token payment on ecosystems such as Base and Solana. It also enables seamless integration with traditional payment rails including the Automated Clearing House (ACH) and bank card networks. This significantly enhances the commercial scalability of AI services. Following the release, assets across the x402 ecosystem saw significant gains. This validates a broader mid-cycle thesis for 2025: AI business models are transitioning from conceptual experimentation toward scalable, revenue-oriented deployment. HTX’s early support for core AI-linked assets provided users with timely access to this narrative-driven market opportunity. ● PAYAI (PayAI Network) : +103%, emerging as one of the strongest performers within the x402 AI ecosystem. Built on ElizaOS, libp2p, IPFS, and Solana, PayAI operates as an open-source, decentralized marketplace for AI agents. Growing market attention around model capability upgrades and ecosystem expansion plans have positioned PAYAI as a key proxy for speculative capital inflows into the AI sector. ● SQD (Subsquid) : +114%, reflecting renewed interest in AI-focused compute infrastructure. The SQD Network functions as a decentralized data lake and query engine, offering developers high-performance, permissionless access to on-chain data. Rising expectations around compute demand drove a valuation recovery, with narrative momentum and trading volume reinforcing one another. Privacy Protocols Regain Attention as ZBT and ZEC Advance in Tandem On-chain privacy is increasingly viewed as a foundational infrastructure for the next market cycle. Against a backdrop of regulatory recalibration and industry restructuring, the privacy sector has seen renewed inflows, forming a “new-and-legacy resonance” dynamic across assets. HTX’s diversified asset coverage has allowed users to participate across multiple layers of this narrative. ● ZBT (Zerobase) : +127%, ranking as the best performer overall. Zerobase is a decentralized cryptographic infrastructure network supporting products such as zkStaking, zkLogin, and ProofYield. It bridges institutional DeFi, user privacy protection, and real-world asset (RWA) strategies, combining privacy security with system verifiability and trust. ● ZEC (Zcash) : +22%. Zcash is a decentralized, open-source project, developed on the Zerocash Protocol published in the IEEE Security & Privacy conference in 2014. It leverages zero-knowledge proof technology and multi-address mechanism to ensure transaction anonymity. Memecoins Gain Momentum Across Multiple Ecosystems As the year-end approaches, seasonal memecoin trading activity has begun to resurface. Assets characterized by lightweight narratives and strong liquidity once again demonstrated their volatility-driven appeal. On HTX, several memecoins recorded notable gains, supported by efficient execution and deep liquidity that enabled users to capture short-term opportunities. ● DONKEY: +21%, a BSC-based memecoin with robust community engagement. The project originates from a social media post by Binance founder CZ, in which he referred to himself as a donkey. In Chinese culture, the donkey is seen as a symbol of hard work and diligence, representing those who work tirelessly. ● MYRO (Myro) : +29%, a Solana-based memecoin. Named after Myro, the dog of Solana co-founder Raj Gokal, the project pays tribute to both its namesake and the broader crypto community’s enduring affinity for dog-themed narratives. ● HIPPO (sudeng) : +33%, a memecoin within the SUI ecosystem. Created by community supporters to celebrate Sudeng, widely regarded as “the world’s cutest hippo,” the project has adopted a community-driven governance approach and donates part of its proceeds to global wildlife initiatives. Multi-Sector Recovery Including DeFi and Layer 1 Ecosystems Beyond headline narratives, a broader rally across DeFi and Layer 1 assets suggests improving incremental capital inflows and the potential continuation of a year-end market trend. ● 0G (Zero Gravity): +38%, positioned at the intersection of DeFi and AI. As a decentralized operating system for AI applications and blockchain, Zero Gravity coordinates hardware resources such as storage and computation alongside software assets including data and models, enabling the scalable handling of complex AI workloads. ● SPK (Spark) : +17%, supported by renewed capital inflows and improving protocol expectations. Spark operates as an on-chain capital allocator, currently deploying $3.86 billion across the DeFi, CeFi, and RWA sectors. Its automated, market-responsive allocation framework enhances capital efficiency while maintaining a conservative risk profile. ● XPL (Plasma): + 25%, a Layer 1 payment infrastructure project. Plasma is an EVM-compatible Layer 1 blockchain designed for high-throughput, low-cost global stablecoin payments. As ecosystem activity expands, traffic and usage expectations have continued to support price strength.

Speaking at the annual meeting of the Chinese People’s Political Consultative Conference, Jinping called the year “extraordinary” for China as it defied global pressures. “The growth rate is expected to reach around 5%, continuing to rank high among the world’s major economies,” he said. He pointed to a shift in focus: away from just growing fast, and toward improving quality and innovation. Xi also warned against “reckless” projects and backed slowing down in certain regions to avoid unnecessary risks. China’s factory and service activity shows signs of recovery Data is backing up his claim. The official manufacturing PMI for December hit 50.1, jumping past the breakeven mark and beating the 49.2 forecast. That’s also a rise from November’s 49.2. The composite PMI, which includes both manufacturing and services, rose to 50.7 from 49.7, a clear step into expansion territory. Services and construction aren’t sitting still either. The non-manufacturing PMI climbed to 50.2, up from 49.5 the month before. All of this points to a broader comeback after a rough patch earlier in the year. Huo Lihui from China’s National Bureau of Statistics said December saw a clear boost in new orders, marking a “significant expansion” in both supply and demand. The private sector backed that up too. A separate PMI by independent firm RatingDog reached 50.1 in December, up from 49.9. This also beat the expected figure of 49.8. Yao Yu, founder of RatingDog, said manufacturing is growing again. He said new orders have been rising for seven months straight, helped by product launches and more business activity. But Yao also said that while companies are still hopeful for 2026, their confidence has dropped below normal levels. Large firms grow faster while small ones stay behind The National Bureau of Statistics showed that large enterprises are leading the recovery, as their PMI jumped to 50.8, 1.5 points higher than the month before. Medium-sized firms edged up to 49.8, but that’s still below the growth line. Small businesses are still shrinking. Their index dropped to 48.6, a 0.5 point fall from November. Markets didn’t react with much cheer. The Hang Seng index in Hong Kong dropped 0.83%, while the CSI 300 on the mainland rose 0.33%. It’s a mixed read, as investors watch closely for more signs of long-term momentum. The numbers come just days after the central bank decided to leave loan prime rates unchanged, even as the economy struggles with weak demand and a housing sector mess. November’s retail sales and industrial output came in below forecasts. Even fixed asset investment fell, another sign the recovery still has holes. Meanwhile, Beijing is also trying to balance currency pressures. The yuan is allowed to inch up slowly, which keeps trading partners calm and blocks fast inflows of speculative cash. A stronger currency can help bring in cheaper imports and move China closer to its goal of making the yuan a global player.

This dual achievement represents a significant turning point for the world’s second-largest blockchain, demonstrating tangible progress in solving the long-standing scalability trilemma that has challenged decentralized networks for years. The record-breaking performance follows strategic network upgrades throughout 2024 and early 2025, fundamentally transforming Ethereum’s capacity and efficiency for millions of users worldwide. Ethereum Mainnet Transaction Milestone Analysis The Ethereum mainnet processed exactly 2,201,457 transactions on Tuesday, surpassing the previous record of 1.97 million set during the 2021 bull market peak. This 11.7% increase represents more than just numerical growth—it signals fundamental improvements in network architecture. Transaction throughput has increased consistently throughout 2025, with monthly averages showing 15% quarter-over-quarter growth since the beginning of the year. Network validators processed these transactions across 7,125 blocks, maintaining an average block time of 12.1 seconds throughout the 24-hour period. Several factors contributed to this transaction volume surge. Firstly, decentralized finance (DeFi) activity increased by 34% month-over-month, with lending protocols and decentralized exchanges accounting for 41% of all transactions. Secondly, non-fungible token (NFT) marketplaces experienced renewed interest, generating 18% of transaction volume. Thirdly, layer-2 solution bridging and settlement transactions represented 22% of the total, indicating healthy ecosystem integration. The remaining 19% comprised various smart contract executions, wallet interactions, and standard ETH transfers. Comparative Network Performance Metrics Metric 2023 Average 2024 Average 2025 Record Day Daily Transactions 1.1 million 1.6 million 2.2 million Average Fee $4.27 $1.43 $0.17 Success Rate 98.2% 99.1% 99.7% Peak TPS 32 45 68 Transaction Fee Reduction and Network Efficiency Concurrently with the transaction volume record, Ethereum mainnet average fees dropped to 17 cents, representing a 92% reduction from the $2.15 average observed just six months ago. This fee reduction occurred despite the increased network demand, contradicting traditional blockchain economic models where higher usage typically drives higher costs. The improved fee structure results directly from protocol-level optimizations implemented through recent upgrades, particularly enhancing gas efficiency and block space utilization. Gas optimization improvements include: EIP-7702 implementation : Reduced calldata costs by 40% for certain transaction types Blob storage efficiency : Increased data availability per block by 300% Validator optimization : Improved block proposal efficiency reducing orphaned blocks by 65% State management : Enhanced state access patterns decreasing computational overhead These technical improvements translate directly to user benefits. A standard ERC-20 token transfer now costs approximately $0.12 compared to $3.80 in early 2024. Similarly, complex DeFi interactions that previously cost $25-50 now average $1.20-2.50. This dramatic reduction makes Ethereum accessible for microtransactions and frequent interactions that were previously economically prohibitive. The Impact of Pectra and Fusaka Upgrades The Pectra upgrade, implemented in Q4 2024, introduced several critical improvements to Ethereum’s execution layer. Most significantly, it enhanced the EVM’s parallel processing capabilities, allowing validators to execute multiple transactions simultaneously when they don’t conflict. This change increased theoretical throughput by approximately 40% without compromising decentralization or security. The upgrade also introduced more efficient memory management and optimized precompiles for common cryptographic operations. Fusaka, deployed in Q1 2025, focused on consensus layer improvements. It implemented: Dynamic validator committees : Adjusting committee sizes based on network load Improved attestation aggregation : Reducing bandwidth requirements by 35% Enhanced fork choice rule : Decreasing finalization time from 12.8 to 9.2 minutes Validator lifecycle management : Streamlining entry and exit processes Together, these upgrades created synergistic effects. The execution layer improvements (Pectra) increased transaction processing capacity, while the consensus layer enhancements (Fusaka) ensured validators could keep pace with the increased load without compromising network security or decentralization. This coordinated approach represents Ethereum’s maturation from a monolithic upgrade philosophy to a modular improvement strategy addressing specific bottlenecks systematically. Network Health Indicators Beyond raw transaction numbers, several key indicators demonstrate Ethereum’s improved health. The network’s total value secured in staking contracts reached 42 million ETH, representing approximately 35% of circulating supply. This high participation rate enhances security while distributing validation responsibilities across more entities. Additionally, the client diversity ratio improved to 68% for execution clients and 72% for consensus clients, reducing systemic risks associated with client dominance. Layer-2 networks continue processing approximately 75% of Ethereum-related transactions off-chain while settling proofs on the mainnet. This symbiotic relationship has matured significantly, with L2s now contributing more than $850,000 daily in fee revenue to the mainnet while providing users with near-instant finality and microscopic fees. The record mainnet transactions occurred alongside approximately 8.2 million daily L2 transactions, demonstrating the multi-layer scaling approach’s effectiveness. Broader Ecosystem Implications and Future Outlook The transaction milestone and fee reduction have immediate implications across the blockchain ecosystem. Developers can now design applications with different economic assumptions, enabling business models previously impossible due to high transaction costs. Enterprise adoption barriers have lowered significantly, with corporate blockchain pilots reporting 80% reduction in operational costs compared to 2024 implementations. The improved metrics also strengthen Ethereum’s position in institutional evaluations, potentially influencing ETF approvals and traditional finance integration. Looking forward, several developments could further enhance Ethereum’s capabilities: Verkle trees implementation : Scheduled for late 2025, potentially reducing state size by 90% Single slot finality : Research progressing toward 12-second transaction finality Account abstraction expansion : Making blockchain interactions seamless for non-technical users Cross-rollup interoperability : Enabling seamless asset movement between layer-2 solutions The network’s improved performance comes at a crucial time as competition intensifies from alternative layer-1 blockchains and emerging scaling solutions. Ethereum’s response—improving base layer performance while maintaining decentralization and security—validates its long-term development philosophy. The record transactions and reduced fees demonstrate that protocol evolution, rather than revolutionary replacement, can successfully address scalability challenges. Conclusion The Ethereum mainnet achieving 2.2 million daily transactions with fees of just 17 cents represents a watershed moment for blockchain scalability. This achievement validates years of research and development, demonstrating that careful protocol evolution can dramatically improve network capacity while reducing user costs. The Pectra and Fusaka upgrades provided the technical foundation for this performance leap, optimizing both execution and consensus layers simultaneously. As Ethereum continues its development roadmap, these improvements establish a new baseline for what’s possible in decentralized network performance while maintaining the security and decentralization principles that define the ecosystem. The milestone confirms Ethereum’s ongoing relevance and adaptability in an increasingly competitive blockchain landscape. FAQs Q1: What caused Ethereum transaction fees to drop so dramatically? The fee reduction resulted primarily from the Pectra and Fusaka network upgrades, which improved gas efficiency, increased block space utilization, and optimized validator performance. These protocol-level changes allowed more transactions per block while reducing computational costs. Q2: How does this transaction volume compare to other major blockchains? Ethereum’s 2.2 million daily transactions place it among the most active major blockchains, though some specialized networks process higher volumes. More significantly, Ethereum achieves this while maintaining full decentralization and supporting complex smart contracts, unlike some higher-throughput networks with different trade-offs. Q3: Will transaction fees remain this low during periods of high demand? While fees will naturally fluctuate with demand, the network upgrades have permanently increased capacity and efficiency. Stress tests indicate fees should remain below $1 for most transactions even during demand spikes 300% higher than current levels, representing a fundamental improvement over previous network behavior. Q4: What impact do layer-2 solutions have on mainnet transaction volume? Layer-2 networks handle approximately 75% of Ethereum-related transactions off-chain while periodically settling proofs on the mainnet. This symbiotic relationship actually increases mainnet activity as L2s batch thousands of transactions into single mainnet settlements while paying fees that support network security. Q5: How does this affect Ethereum’s energy consumption and environmental impact? Since transitioning to proof-of-stake in 2022, Ethereum’s energy consumption has remained relatively constant despite transaction volume increases. The recent upgrades improve computational efficiency, potentially reducing energy per transaction by 15-20%, though exact measurements require further study as the changes stabilize.

This $0.04 DeFi Altcoin Could Lead 2026,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/next-cryptocurrency-to-30x-this-0-04-defi-altcoin-could-lead-2026/,"When investors are in demand for the next crypto to blow out of proportion, they often fail to realize that there is no screamer about it very often. Rather than hype, strong candidates generally tend to have consistent funding, definite product plans and increasing participation. With the debate on the most successful crypto to invest in today once more spreading the proliferation of conversations, the market analysts reckon that there are DeFi projects selling under $0.05 worth looking into. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is the name of one of such altcoins that received that attention. Presale Momentum Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is now valued at $0.04, and it has clearly risen to the group of potential best cheap cryptos to buy at the early stage among many investors. The presale system is determined by stages, and every stage has a fixed number of tokens allocated at a predetermined price. With more demand, the phases will close more rapidly and the pricing also will rise. Until now, Mutuum Finance has accumulated $19.5M, had 18,700 holders, and sold over 820M tokens. Out of the total 4B MUTM, 45.5% are distributed to the presale. This implies that much of it remains in distribution though pricing has already gone out. The presale began at $0.01 in early 2025. Early investors have also already MUTM appreciation as the token is currently priced at $0.04. Its price at the time of official launch is formulated at $0.06 which most observers consider to be a major psychological point. To the investors, who are comparing the cannot be made the same prices of crypto today, there is a difference between the price at $0.04 and those nearer to the launch. A $2,000 entry now secures 50,000 MUTM. This would only purchase a lot fewer tokens in the launch pricing. What Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is Creating Mutuum Finance is developing a lending protocol which is decentralized. The protocol enables users to provide assets and or raise yield or borrow based on collateral in a designed manner. The system will have a gradual scaling structure, where the rules will be adjusted to the market demand, not predetermined incentive. Assets are provided by users and they are rewarded with mtTokens. Such tokens are reflective of their status and increase in worth as borrowers pay up interest. This directly correlates protocol usage to user returns. The system adopted by Mutuum Finance is also buy-and-distribute. MUTM bought on the open market is redistributed to users who post mtTokens in the safety module. This is binding token demand onto real activity rather than short-term trade. Other observers think such an arrangement will encourage more healthy pricing over the long term. Security has been a priority. Mutuum Finance is rated at 90/100 CertiK Token Scan and the Halborn Security audit is complete, awaiting final update. Audits would also significantly help to weed out serious and risky projects to investors as they seek to know what crypto to invest in next. Price Outlook and Design The issue of comments revolves around stablecoins which form the basis of lending schemes since they make them less volatile and encourage a stable demand to borrow. Mutuum Finance is highly engaged in the use of stablecoins, which may fund the protocol even in the time when crypto charts may appear shaky. The protocol is meant to be based on sound oracle infrastructure, and the plans consist of Chainlink price feeds, fallback options, and aggregated data sources. Pricing of liquidations and collateral management requires appropriate pricing. The protocols with good oracle systems are said to be more resilient when markets move fast, therefore, industry speculation. On this basis, certain observers think that the progression of Mutuum Finance may be cautious to a bullish trend. In a measured case, the MUTM could protrude its initial launch price as the adoption increases. Under a bullish case, it is projected that in the long term of usage and revenue upsurge, a 10x to 15x improvement can be achieved. Whale Interest and V1 Launch The timeline of Mutuum Finance development is another factor why it is becoming one of the top crypto companies to watch. The team is getting ready in the V1 of the lending protocol, and it is expected to run on the Sepolia testnet. This enables the community to experience such features as liquidity pools, mtTokens, and liquidation logic with ETH and USDT. Phase 6 of the presale was quickly sold which channeled an evidence of an increasing demand. Large individual allocations have also been witnessed in recent updates on funding. Inclusion of whales is usually relevant since it implies trust in prolonged results instead of exchanges in the short-term. The investor activity in the first quarter shows that there is a shift in capital flow between better-developed tokens and newer projects in DeFi that have noticeable achievements. This change is significant to the crypto beginner who wants to purchase a crypto that has the potential to grow over time. When a protocol shifts further in its life cycle past presale to live testing, the story shifts usually to performance. As MUTM continues to sell under $0.1, its presale continues, and a beta launch is on the cards, Mutuum Finance is gaining growing popularity as a next cryptocurrency.

But now, under Trump’s second term, that protection is getting axed, as his budget director Russell Vought, who also runs the place, wants to shut it down completely. Investigations are being pushed over to the Justice Department, which wasn’t built to chase credit card scams or payday loan schemes. Trump, speaking about his decision at the White House , said, “It’s very important to get rid of the agency,” claiming that Senator Elizabeth Warren used it “as her little personal agency to go around and destroy people.” Elizabeth, who helped create the CFPB in 2010, fired back almost immediately, saying that she will fight back because “this is about enforcing the law as it is written, so that billionaires and billionaire corporations don’t cheat American families.” White House tries to fire workers and reroute enforcement The Trump administration is trying to fire as many as 90% of CFPB employees and stop the agency from getting more money. Vought, in an October podcast appearance, said he has no plans to keep it running. The Federal Reserve, which funds the CFPB, was told it needs to return to what the administration calls “profitability” before more money can be requested. That argument got tossed out by a federal judge this week, who called it legally baseless. But that hasn’t stopped the machine. In July, Congressional Republicans cut the CFPB’s max funding limit. Since then, a decade of consumer finance rules have been dismantled. We’re talking protections around student loans, credit card fees, mortgages, and overdraft charges. Most of the watchdog’s pending actions have either been paused or dropped altogether. Insiders are quitting. Oversight is crumbling. The agency has basically stopped checking in on the very industries it was made to watch. People who rely on the CFPB have noticed. Reuters spoke to lawyers, counselors, and broke Americans who said they’re scared. The agency was their only help against creditors who play dirty. With it fading, people with medical bills, job losses, or bad luck say they’ll be left alone with financial predators. Elizabeth Warren warns no other agency protects consumers first Elizabeth, reflecting on her time as a bankruptcy law professor, said the system used to be chaos. “I was stunned by the number of people in financial trouble who had lost a job or got sick but who had also been cheated by one or more of their creditors,” she said . She said no other agency put consumer protection first. Most agencies, she said, treated it as an afterthought, somewhere between fifth and tenth on the priority list. With no CFPB, people getting scammed have no backup. The agency used to go after shady lenders and hold them accountable. Now, Trump’s team wants that job shifted elsewhere, which critics say means nowhere. Meanwhile, over in China , the government is doing the exact opposite; pumping money into consumer protections. Xinhua, the country’s state media, reported that 62.5 billion yuan in long-term bond funds is being given to local governments to support a 2026 subsidy program. The plan gives Chinese citizens cash back when they swap out old fridges, TVs, and even bikes or cars. The country launched this scheme in 2024 to fight sluggish demand. It’s now being expanded. Li Chao, spokesperson for the National Development and Reform Commission, said the money is already going out to support the Spring Festival and New Year holiday spending. Buyers get 15% back when they replace appliances like washing machines or smartphones, capped at 500 yuan per item. If they trade in old cars, they can get 12% of the price of a new electric vehicle, up to 20,000 yuan. If they’re just upgrading to a newer clean vehicle, they still get 8%, maxing out at 15,000 yuan.

Here’s Why,https://timestabloid.com/analyst-says-xrp-price-could-dump-to-0-8-heres-why/,"A sequence of subtle shifts has been forming beneath XRP’s price action. Ali Martinez (@ali_charts), a well-respected analyst, believes these signs suggest a significant downward move for the asset. In a detailed X thread, Martinez walked through several charts that track participation, holder behavior, and price structure, suggesting the asset may fall to $0.80. Declining Network Participation Sets the Tone Martinez opened his analysis by focusing on network health rather than price candles. He expressed concern for declining engagement across the network. He stated that network activity has cooled noticeably . Daily active addresses have dropped to approximately 38,500, which he described as evidence of waning participation and interest. Lower address counts often reflect fewer transactions and reduced usage, conditions that can weaken price support over time. The analyst linked to an XRP Network Activity chart that showed a steady decline, reinforcing his point. Here’s why $XRP could be at risk of a drop to $0.80. — Ali Charts (@alicharts) December 29, 2025 Whale Selling Adds Supply Pressure After addressing participation, Martinez turned to large holders. He noted a clear shift in whale behavior during the same period. Rather than accumulating XRP, these wallets appear to be reducing exposure. “At the same time, whales have turned into sellers,” Martinez said. He added that they have been “offloading more than 40 million XRP in recent days.” The XRP Held by Whales chart supported this claim, showing a visible reduction in balances among large addresses . This combination of falling network activity and whale selling can create a difficult environment for price growth. When large holders distribute tokens into a market with declining demand, downside pressure can build quickly. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Key Price Levels Come Into Focus With these conditions in place, Martinez outlined the technical levels that now matter most. He identified $1.77 as a critical support zone. “If selling pressure continues, XRP risks losing the $1.77 support,” he wrote. He explained that a breakdown at this level would be significant. “A breakdown here opens the door to the next major support zone near $0.80,” Martinez said. This level appeared repeatedly throughout the thread as a key downside area if current trends persist. Martinez used a volume-based distribution chart to reinforce his view. “Below $1.77, the next meaningful area of support for XRP is $0.79 ,” he stated. The chart highlighted this region as an area where past buying activity has concentrated. Disclaimer : This content is meant to inform and should not be considered financial advice.

Key Takeaways: Family offices expanded crypto exposure in 2025, with many making first-time allocations. Bitcoin and Ether remain the main entry points as improved infrastructure offsets limited in-house expertise. Market volatility and weak prices are tempering expectations for broader adoption in 2026. However, sharp price swings and weak recent performance are raising doubts about how far that momentum can carry into 2026, according to a report by Financial News . “Family offices moved from ‘crypto experimenters’ to structured allocators [in 2025], allocating modest but growing percentages of wealth to digital assets,” Muhammed Yesilhark, chief investment officer at NOIA Capital, told the outlet. Family Offices Favor Bitcoin and Ether as Infrastructure Improves Yesilhark added that most allocations focused on areas where infrastructure, custody solutions and risk controls had improved. Despite broader interest, Bitcoin and Ether remained the main entry points, reflecting limited in-house crypto expertise at many family offices. Survey data points to a rapid rise in engagement. A study by BNY Mellon published in October found that 74% of ultra-high-net-worth family offices are now investing in or actively exploring cryptocurrencies, up 21 percentage points from the previous year. Market participants say that increase was driven not just by price cycles, but by a more developed ecosystem around custody, compliance and regulated investment vehicles. Family offices are doing a complete 180 on crypto and are treating it like infrastructure. And the speed of that shift tells you something about where serious money is actually headed https://t.co/ukFGXvEcKg 1/23 — Digital Ascension Group (@DAGFamilyOffice) December 28, 2025 Chris Rhine, head of liquid active strategies at Galaxy Digital, said his firm saw a noticeable wave of first-time allocations this year. Many family offices, he noted, conducted detailed due diligence before committing capital, signaling a longer-term approach rather than opportunistic trading. That cautious entry did not stop some high-profile moves. Hong Kong-based family office VMS made its first crypto investment by backing digital asset hedge fund Re7 with $10 million. Separately, the family office of Arthur Hayes is planning to raise $250 million for its first crypto-focused private equity fund, underscoring growing institutional confidence in the sector’s infrastructure layer. IPO Revival Could Pull Family Offices Deeper Into Crypto in 2026 Looking ahead, Pete Najarian, founder and managing partner of Raptor Digital, expects crypto to take up a larger share of family office portfolios in 2026, especially if public markets reopen for digital asset firms. A more active IPO pipeline , he said, could draw interest from families seeking exposure through exchange-traded funds and other regulated vehicles. Still, recent market conditions have tempered enthusiasm. The crypto market has shed more than $1 trillion in capitalization since October, with Bitcoin and Ether each down over 30%. One UAE-based family office representative said the volatility has pushed some investors to favor steadier assets such as real estate. “We are still far from broader adoption,” the person said. Yesilhark argued that success in 2026 will hinge on discipline. Family offices that focus on infrastructure, selective bets and strong underwriting, rather than short-term speculation, are more likely to stay committed through the next cycle.

The Chinese yuan emerges as the region’s top performer, while the Japanese yen remains surprisingly flat. Meanwhile, the Indian rupee bucks the broader regional trend with unexpected movements that have captured market attention. This comprehensive analysis examines the complex factors driving these divergent currency performances across Asia’s major economies. Asian Currencies Deliver Strong Yearly Performance Amid Global Shifts Throughout 2024, Asian currencies demonstrated remarkable resilience against global economic headwinds. Regional central banks implemented coordinated policies that stabilized exchange rates. Furthermore, improved trade balances across multiple Asian nations supported currency valuations. The region’s economic recovery outpaced many Western economies, attracting substantial foreign investment flows. Consequently, capital inflows strengthened local currencies against major global benchmarks. Market analysts note that this represents a significant shift from the previous three years of currency weakness across Asia. Several structural factors contributed to this positive performance. Manufacturing exports from Southeast Asia increased by 8.3% year-over-year. Additionally, technology sector growth in Taiwan and South Korea boosted their respective currencies. Regional tourism recovery also provided support, particularly for currencies in Thailand and Singapore. Most importantly, reduced inflation pressures allowed central banks to maintain supportive monetary policies. These combined elements created a favorable environment for Asian currency appreciation throughout 2024. Chinese Yuan Emerges as Regional Top Performer The Chinese yuan achieved the strongest gains among Asian currencies in 2024, appreciating approximately 6.2% against the US dollar. This performance reflects China’s successful economic rebalancing efforts. The People’s Bank of China implemented measured interventions that stabilized the currency. Moreover, increased international usage of the yuan for trade settlements supported its value. China’s current account surplus expanded to $68 billion in the third quarter alone. Foreign investors also increased their holdings of Chinese government bonds by 14% year-over-year. Several specific developments drove the yuan’s outperformance. China’s digital currency initiatives gained significant traction internationally. The country’s technology exports maintained strong growth despite global headwinds. Additionally, strategic commodity stockpiling reduced import volatility. Most notably, bilateral trade agreements with Middle Eastern nations increased yuan-denominated transactions. These factors combined to create sustained demand for the Chinese currency throughout 2024. Expert Analysis on Yuan’s Structural Strengthening Financial institutions have documented the yuan’s evolving role in global markets. The International Monetary Fund reports increased yuan holdings in global reserves. Furthermore, regional trade blocs now incorporate yuan settlement mechanisms. Currency strategists highlight reduced capital outflow pressures compared to previous years. China’s financial market liberalization also attracted long-term institutional investors. These structural changes suggest the yuan’s strength may extend beyond short-term cyclical factors. Japanese Yen Remains Surprisingly Flat Despite Policy Shifts The Japanese yen displayed unusual stability throughout 2024, ending the year essentially flat against the US dollar. This performance surprised many analysts who anticipated volatility. The Bank of Japan maintained its ultra-accommodative monetary policy stance for most of the year. However, subtle adjustments to yield curve control created market uncertainty. Japan’s persistent trade deficit continued to pressure the currency, while tourism recovery provided some offsetting support. Several competing forces created the yen’s flat trajectory. Foreign investment in Japanese equities reached record levels in early 2024. Meanwhile, Japanese investors increased overseas bond purchases significantly. The currency’s traditional safe-haven status diminished during global market stability periods. Additionally, Japan’s aging demographic profile continued to influence long-term currency outlooks. These conflicting dynamics resulted in minimal net movement for the yen throughout the year. Indian Rupee Bucks Regional Trend with Unique Trajectory The Indian rupee followed a distinct path that diverged from broader Asian currency trends in 2024. While most regional currencies appreciated, the rupee experienced periods of unexpected volatility. India’s central bank implemented strategic interventions to manage exchange rate stability. The country’s strong economic growth attracted substantial foreign direct investment. However, elevated oil import costs created persistent current account pressure. These competing factors created a complex trading environment for the rupee throughout the year. Several India-specific developments influenced the rupee’s unique performance. The country’s digital payment infrastructure expansion reduced currency demand for certain transactions. Additionally, India’s increasing integration into global supply chains affected trade flows. Foreign portfolio investors demonstrated changing patterns in their Indian market participation. Most significantly, India’s domestic consumption growth created different import-export dynamics compared to other Asian economies. These distinctive characteristics explain why the rupee followed its own trajectory in 2024. Comparative Performance Analysis of Major Asian Currencies The table below illustrates the yearly performance of key Asian currencies against the US dollar in 2024: Currency Yearly Change (%) Key Influencing Factors Chinese Yuan +6.2 Trade surplus, digital currency adoption, foreign investment Japanese Yen +0.3 Policy uncertainty, tourism recovery, trade deficit Indian Rupee -1.8 Oil imports, strong growth, central bank intervention South Korean Won +4.7 Technology exports, semiconductor recovery Singapore Dollar +3.9 Financial hub status, regional trade growth This comparative data reveals several important patterns. Technology-exporting nations generally performed well. Meanwhile, commodity-importing economies faced greater challenges. Currency performance correlated strongly with each country’s specific economic structure. The data also shows how regional integration created some performance convergence. However, domestic policy decisions remained crucial determinants of individual currency trajectories. Global Context and Future Outlook for Asian Currencies The strong yearly performance of Asian currencies occurred within a complex global environment. The US Federal Reserve’s monetary policy decisions created important cross-currents throughout 2024. European economic challenges also influenced capital flows toward Asian markets. Furthermore, commodity price fluctuations affected different Asian economies unevenly. Geopolitical developments created both risks and opportunities for regional currencies. These global factors interacted with domestic conditions to produce the observed currency performances. Looking toward 2025, several trends warrant close monitoring. The potential normalization of global interest rate differentials may affect capital flows. Additionally, evolving trade patterns could reshape currency demand across Asia. Technological advancements in payment systems might alter traditional currency usage patterns. Climate-related economic transitions will likely influence different Asian economies unevenly. Most importantly, demographic shifts across the region will continue affecting long-term currency fundamentals. Conclusion Asian currencies delivered strong yearly gains in 2024, with the Chinese yuan leading regional performance as the top gainer. The Japanese yen remained surprisingly flat despite significant policy developments, while the Indian rupee bucked the broader trend with its unique trajectory. These currency movements reflect complex interactions between domestic economic conditions, policy decisions, and global market forces. The divergent performances highlight Asia’s economic diversity and the region’s evolving role in global financial markets. As Asian economies continue developing, their currencies will likely play increasingly important roles in international finance and trade settlement systems. FAQs Q1: Why did the Chinese yuan perform so strongly in 2024? The yuan benefited from China’s trade surplus expansion, increased international usage for settlements, foreign investment inflows, and successful economic rebalancing efforts. Digital currency initiatives and strategic commodity management also provided support. Q2: What factors kept the Japanese yen flat throughout the year? Conflicting forces including foreign equity investment, overseas bond purchases by Japanese investors, diminished safe-haven demand, persistent trade deficits, and Bank of Japan policy uncertainty created offsetting pressures that resulted in minimal net movement. Q3: How did the Indian rupee differ from other Asian currencies? The rupee experienced unique volatility due to India’s strong economic growth attracting investment while elevated oil imports created current account pressure, resulting in a trajectory that diverged from the broader regional appreciation trend. Q4: What role did central banks play in Asian currency performance? Regional central banks implemented coordinated stabilization policies, strategic interventions, and measured monetary approaches that helped maintain currency stability while supporting economic recovery across different Asian economies. Q5: Could these currency trends continue into 2025? While past performance doesn’t guarantee future results, structural factors including trade patterns, investment flows, policy decisions, and global economic conditions will determine whether these currency trends persist or reverse in the coming year.

The Chinese tech firm’s 2026 budget has surpassed that of 2025, which was 85 billion Yuan (~$12.15B), although the final figure has yet to be confirmed. Furthermore, it remains to be confirmed whether Nvidia can sell its H200 GPUs (Graphics Processing Units) in China, as the recently lifted ban has yet to take full effect. Meanwhile, the company’s in-house chip manufacturing division has made significant progress in producing a lower-cost China-tailored chip that matches the performance of Nvidia H200 chips. ByteDance, which runs Douyin and TikTok, has a market capitalization of $500 billion and has established a chip design unit that employs over 1,000 workers. The company has further invested heavily in pursuing a mix of internal developments, like memory technologies such as high-bandwidth memory. It is also aggressively staking in related startups. Doubao processed over 50T tokens daily this month ByteDance’s Doubao chatbot processed over 50 trillion tokens daily in December alone, up from 4 trillion in December last year. The company said earlier this month that it is scaling back the capabilities of its agentic AI on its AI-powered smartphone. Meanwhile, Volcano Engine is set to serve as the exclusive AI cloud partner of the Spring Festival Gala sponsored by China’s most viewed television broadcast, China Central Television. Volcan Engine’s president, Tai Dai, recently said the platform has more than 100 corporate clients who have spent over 1 trillion tokens to date. According to the SCMP, ByteDance’s chip division is also working closely with its frontier AI research team, Seed. The chip unit was relocated to Picoheart, a Singapore-incorporated subsidiary, in September amid escalating U.S.-China geopolitical tensions. Some of the company’s staff from mainland China were requested to relocate to Singapore to undertake sensitive tasks. Meanwhile, Nvidia hopes to export its newly approved H200 chips to Chinese customers before the Lunar New Year, which falls in late January or early February. Chinese tech companies have shown growing interest in the processor, which is Nvidia’s second-most powerful chip. However, Beijing has not yet approved any purchases, and the timeline could change depending on regulatory progress. ByteDance to order $5.7B worth of Huawei chips in 2026 ByteDance has also announced plans to order $5.7 billion worth of Huawei Ascend processors in 2026, as Huawei and Nvidia wrestle fiercely in the global AI space. A recent Huawei report suggested that Chinese firms are increasingly opting for local products over foreign ones as geopolitical tensions escalate. The report further reveals that ByteDance is about to receive its first batch of Huawei Ascend chips worth at least tens of billions of Yuans. It is also rumored that the company is inspecting a sample of Huawei chips, although it has not confirmed if it will make any orders. Meanwhile, the large-scale increase in local computing power is driven by the computing power gap that emerged in April after restrictions on Nvidia H200 chips were implemented. It is also driven by the explosive growth in the number of token calls for ByteDance’s AI application and cloud computing business. ByteDance is reportedly in the process of deepening ties with Huawei, as relying on Nvidia has proven too risky. Foreign chips can either be used to spy on China’s data or compromise consumer data privacy. Meng Wanzhou, Huawei’s CFO, has commended her company’s progress, adding that it has built a strong foundation this year after the expansions to both its Ascend and Kunpeng AI chips. She further pointed out that Ascend AI chips now have over four million developers, along with over 3,000 partners. The smartest crypto minds already read our newsletter. Want in?

One of the cryptocurrencies involved in the process is Cardano (ADA), whose price has plunged by 3.5% on December 30. Bye-Bye to These Pairs Binance revealed that it will delist the following cross-margin pairs: BCH/FDUSD, TAO/FDUSD, AVAX/FDUSD, LTC/FDUSD, SUI/FDUSD, ADA/FDUSD, and LINK/FDUSD on January 6. It will also remove the isolated margin pairs involving the same cryptocurrencies on that date. “Effective immediately, users will no longer be able to transfer any amount of assets of the aforementioned pair(s) via manual transfers and Auto-Transfer Mode into their Isolated Margin accounts. If users hold outstanding liabilities of said tokens, these users may only manually transfer up to the amount of liabilities of that token into their Isolated Margin accounts, less any collateral already available,” the announcement reads. The common denominator across all trading pairs that are about to be removed is the stablecoin First Digital USD (FDUSD), with Binance failing to provide a reason for its decision. The non-stablecoin cryptocurrencies experienced little to no volatility following the news. Usually, more substantial moves are observed when a coin is initially listed or when all services involving a certain token are terminated. The Previous Updates Approximately a week ago, the exchange released another update affecting Cardano traders. This time, it opened trading for ADA/USD1 as well as the pairs ASTER/USD1, LUNA/USDC, LUNC/USDC, and ZEC/USD1 on Binance Spot. The new service is not available to all clients, as those residing in the United States, Canada, Cuba, Iran, the Netherlands, and other countries are excluded. Following the announcement, ADA’s price rose by 4%, while ASTER pumped by 3.5%. For its part, LUNA experienced a double-digit increase. At the start of December, Binance announced the removal of StaFi (FIS), REI Network (REI), and Voxies (VOXEL). The prices of the affected assets headed south after the news. The same thing happened in October when the company terminated all services with Flamingo (FLM), Kadena (KDA), and Perpetual Protocol (PERP). KDA took a major blow with its valuation crashing by around 30% following the statement.

Start With the Right License,https://timestabloid.com/the-smart-way-to-launch-a-crypto-business-start-with-the-right-license/,"The crypto industry may have started with rebels and code, but it’s maturing fast. Today, the most successful ventures are built on something surprisingly traditional: legal clarity. No matter the business model, long-term success in crypto takes more than a smart idea. It requires the right license in a jurisdiction that fits the business. In this article, we’ll explore why proper licensing is essential and why working with an experienced consulting partner can make all the difference. Why Licensing Is a Growth Decision, Not a Checkbox In crypto, regulation is no longer a future problem. It’s now baked into how serious businesses operate. Choosing the right crypto license does more than satisfy regulators. It signals professionalism to banks, payment providers, and users. It opens doors for partnerships and cross-border expansion. And it protects founders from the kind of legal uncertainty that can shut things down overnight. But licensing is determined by the company’s business model, services, and geographical location – so choose wisely. Choosing the Right Jurisdiction Matters Regulatory approaches vary. Some countries encourage fast innovation, others focus on tighter control. Each jurisdiction brings its own speed, rules, and level of oversight. Fintech Harbor Consulting Ltd. helps businesses pinpoint the option that best fits their objectives. Below are some standout choices to explore. Poland: Fast Entry, Local Strength Poland has become a practical entry point for crypto exchanges and custody providers looking to operate within the EU. Its regulatory setup is clear and accessible, with a licensing process that moves faster than many alternatives. The Poland crypto exchange license enables businesses to register as VASPs while remaining aligned with wider European requirements. It’s an ideal setup for early-stage companies that want legal standing in the EU without navigating the full licensing weight of larger markets like Germany or France. Switzerland: Trusted, Tested, and Crypto-Ready With a long-standing reputation for financial integrity, Switzerland has become a natural home for serious crypto ventures. Its regulators don’t just tolerate blockchain—they’ve built a clear, structured environment for it to thrive. Tokenization and blockchain companies frequently turn to Switzerland for its stable, business-friendly climate. A Switzerland crypto license not only ensures compliance, but it also increases confidence with investors and partners. CASP License: A New Chapter in European Crypto Compliance For years, crypto businesses in the EU had to juggle a patchwork of local laws—what worked in one country didn’t always fly in the next. MiCA changes the game. It introduces one unified set of rules across the region, and the CASP license is the key to unlocking it. With this license in hand, companies can finally scale across Europe without rewriting the playbook for every border. For companies aiming to scale in Europe, it’s becoming a must-have. Canada: Regulated, But Still Open for Business Canada strikes a balance between strong regulation and innovation. It’s a promising option for companies that want to operate in a North American market without the volatility of U.S. policy shifts. A crypto license in Canada requires compliance with FINTRAC rules and registration as a money services business (MSB). While more formal than some jurisdictions, the structure offers long-term credibility—especially for exchanges and wallet providers. The Consultant Advantage Getting a crypto license isn’t just ticking boxes—it’s paperwork, structure, and strict compliance. One wrong step can stall everything. Fintech Harbor Consulting cuts through the complexity, guiding businesses through each stage with precision. With them, companies move forward confidently, backed by a license that’s done right from day one. Solid licensing is the backbone of any credible crypto business. It earns confidence, keeps liabilities in check, and makes expansion possible. Long-term success is about having a well-planned route through the regulatory landscape.

56634240,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=886584,1767167939,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/56634240.jpeg,About 10% of Europe’s banking workforce faces AI threat by 2030,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/ai-disruption-threatens-200000-europe-jobs/,"About 10% of banking jobs across Europe could disappear by 2030 as lenders lean harder on AI, with analysts saying that more than 200,000 roles are now exposed over the next five years. The forecast comes from Morgan Stanley, which reviewed 35 banks employing around 2.12 million people combined. A straight 10% workforce reduction equals roughly 212,000 job cuts. The expected job cuts focus on central services, meaning back-office roles, middle-office teams, risk management, and compliance units; basically the parts of banks where automation replaces repeat work fastest. Banks are targeting central service jobs for AI replacement operations Morgan Stanley said many lenders expect efficiency to increase by as much as 30% from AI and deeper digital use. Banks have already started acting too, like in November, Dutch lender ABN Amro said it plans to cut about 20% of its full-time workforce by 2028. In March, Société Générale chief executive Slawomir Krupa warned that “nothing is sacred” as the French bank tries to shrink a stubborn cost base. Morgan Stanley analysts said AI helps improve cost-to-income ratios, one of the most watched metrics by investors. These ratios remain high at many consumer-focused lenders, especially in France and Germany. Branch networks remain expensive. Digital channels are cheaper. AI fits directly into that math. Across Europe , banks serving retail customers face the biggest shake-up as more services shift to apps and automated platforms. The surge in AI use has also sparked fear well beyond banking. Several industries already face job losses as software replaces people. Financial services sit near the top of that list. Analysts warn that this wave will not stay limited to support teams. Over time, more functions could be affected as systems grow more capable. Executives warn speed matters as training risks grow At UBS, analysts say AI already changes how banks present themselves to clients. The firm has started turning analysts into digital avatars, sending recorded AI-generated videos to customers. Jason Napier, head of European banks research at UBS, said banks have not yet delivered clear efficiency gains, as cost bases remain large and powerful tools are still early in deployment. Napier added that anyone doubting AI’s impact should spend time testing tools already available. UBS also sent 250 senior leaders to Oxford University for an AI leadership summit in recent months. The goal was to prepare top executives for wider rollout decisions. Still, caution exists. Conor Hillery, co-chief executive for Europe, the Middle East, and Africa at JPMorgan Chase, warned banks not to move too fast. He said leaders must avoid losing sight of core skills while rushing toward automation. JPMorgan aims to use AI to speed up basic work while still training junior staff in fundamentals like cash flow models and price-to-earnings ratios. Hillery said failing to balance both could create future problems.

56634047,649778,1767168002,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/56634047.jpeg,The Future Of Tech: How Blockchain AI And Will Converge By Late 2026,https://bitcoinist.com/how-blockchain-ai-and-will-converge-by-late-2026/,"In a recent piece penned for Entrepreneur, Sandeep Nailwal, the co-founder and CEO of Layer 2 (L2) blockchain Polygon (POL), has made a bold prediction for the technological landscape of 2026. Nailwal envisions a major convergence of blockchain, artificial intelligence (AI), and payment technologies that could potentially “reshape the internet completely.” Blockchain’s Transparency Solution In Nailwal’s vision , AI would assume the role of decision-maker within this cohesive structure. Blockchains would then verify these decisions, ensuring their authenticity, while the payment infrastructure would facilitate the seamless transfer of value to enforce these decisions instantaneously. The fusion of these technologies is poised to have far-reaching implications. Nailwal highlights the role of AI in shaping various aspects of daily life and business operations, from content curation to supply chain logistics and financial decision-making. However, the opacity surrounding artificial intelligence systems poses a challenge, with limited transparency into the decision-making process and data integrity. Blockchains emerge as a solution to this transparency issue, offering a public ledger that provides visibility into transactions, models, and decisions. The security protocols inherent in blockchain technology not only safeguard digital signatures but also verify algorithmic outputs, instilling trust in the decision-making process. Nailwal emphasizes the importance of zero-knowledge proofs (ZKPs) protocols in ensuring transparency without compromising data privacy, allowing for the verification of rules and decisions without revealing sensitive underlying information. Future Of Digital Wallets According to Nailwal’s thesis, the transition from trust-based systems to proof-based systems has already begun, with governments using blockchain platforms to anchor public records and maintain transparency and accountability. Additionally, blockchain payment systems are being trialed by cities worldwide for various applications, from tax collection to cross-border transfers , ushering in a new era of efficiency and security in financial transactions. The evolution of payment systems is another area of focus, with digital currencies poised to streamline cross-border transactions by eliminating intermediaries. Nailwal noted platforms like Polygon, which are currently facilitating seamless stablecoin payments, offering swift and cost-effective transfers for individuals and businesses globally. Furthermore, Nailwal anticipates a future where digital wallets consolidate identity, data, and financial assets, simplifying everyday tasks like payments and document signings. The convergence of AI, blockchain, and payment technologies is expected to redefine user experiences, seamlessly integrating trust mechanisms into daily interactions. Nailwal concluded: The greatest technology shift of 2026 won’t be a new chain or a new model but the unceremonious formation of the converged internet, an infrastructure that can think, verify and pay on its own. Most people won’t notice the change. They’ll just find that the digital world suddenly works as it should — seamlessly. At the time of writing, Polygon’s native token, POL, was trading at $0.1025. This represents year-to-date losses of almost 80%, and 92% compared to the all-time high of $1.29.

As 2025 draws to a close, sentiment across the crypto market continues to recover, with trading activity picking up alongside seasonal year-end momentum. A combination of macro tailwinds and renewed narrative catalysts has driven broad-based sector strength, as AI, privacy, and memecoin assets simultaneously rebound. Capital flows are increasingly gravitating toward high-growth narratives and thematically distinct opportunities. AI Narrative Returns to Center Stage as PAYAI and SQD Lead the Rally Artificial intelligence remains one of the defining long-term narratives of the 2025 crypto cycle, with accelerating real-world adoption driving a revaluation of application assets. One of the key catalysts behind this week’s AI-sector rebound was the official release of Version 2 of x402, an open-source payment protocol for AI agents developed by the Coinbase developer team. The upgraded x402 protocol introduces native multi-chain support, covering token payment on ecosystems such as Base and Solana. It also enables seamless integration with traditional payment rails including the Automated Clearing House (ACH) and bank card networks. This significantly enhances the commercial scalability of AI services. Following the release, assets across the x402 ecosystem saw significant gains. This validates a broader mid-cycle thesis for 2025: AI business models are transitioning from conceptual experimentation toward scalable, revenue-oriented deployment. HTX’s early support for core AI-linked assets provided users with timely access to this narrative-driven market opportunity. PAYAI (PayAI Network) : +103%, emerging as one of the strongest performers within the x402 AI ecosystem. SQD (Subsquid) : +114%, reflecting renewed interest in AI-focused compute infrastructure. Privacy Protocols Regain Attention as ZBT and ZEC Advance in Tandem On-chain privacy is increasingly viewed as a foundational infrastructure for the next market cycle. Against a backdrop of regulatory recalibration and industry restructuring, the privacy sector has seen renewed inflows, forming a “new-and-legacy resonance” dynamic across assets. HTX’s diversified asset coverage has allowed users to participate across multiple layers of this narrative. ZBT (Zerobase) : +127%, ranking as the best performer overall. ZEC (Zcash) : +22%. Zcash is a decentralized, open-source project. Memecoins Gain Momentum Across Multiple Ecosystems As the year-end approaches, seasonal memecoin trading activity has begun to resurface. Assets characterized by lightweight narratives and strong liquidity once again demonstrated their volatility-driven appeal. On HTX, several memecoins recorded notable gains, supported by efficient execution and deep liquidity that enabled users to capture short-term opportunities. DONKEY: +21%, a BSC-based memecoin with robust community engagement. MYRO (Myro) : +29%, a Solana-based memecoin. HIPPO (sudeng) : +33%, a memecoin within the SUI ecosystem. Multi-Sector Recovery Including DeFi and Layer 1 Ecosystems Beyond headline narratives, a broader rally across DeFi and Layer 1 assets suggests improving incremental capital inflows and the potential continuation of a year-end market trend. 0G (Zero Gravity): +38%, positioned at the intersection of DeFi and AI. SPK (Spark) : +17%, supported by renewed capital inflows and improving protocol expectations. XPL (Plasma): + 25%, a Layer 1 payment infrastructure project. Seize Early-Stage Opportunities as HTX Captures Emerging Wealth Effects As market conditions stabilize, sector differentiation remains pronounced. Selecting the right trading venue, featuring forward-looking asset reserves and deep liquidity, has become increasingly critical for users seeking opportunities in the new market cycle. Across this week’s top-performing assets, HTX had already enabled trading access at their early stages, allowing users to grasp more entry points. Through disciplined listing strategies and a robust trading ecosystem, HTX continues to enhance users’ ability to capture opportunities efficiently amid complex market dynamics. Looking ahead, HTX will continue to evolve its platform strategy in line with market trends, user demand, and cycle-driven shifts, expanding high-quality asset coverage and deepening liquidity.

In 2027, it will range between $19.33 and $25.91, with an average price of $20.18. In 2030, it will range between $79.95 and $99.65, with an average price of $82.60. The Aptos blockchain has aggressively attracted capital into its ecosystem, with its total value locked ( TVL ) rising above $800 million. Aptos is a high-performance layer-1 blockchain with a mature ecosystem comprising a variety of decentralized finance (DeFi) applications. Aptos network continues to build decentralized applications and tools for developers. But how about APT’s performance? How high will it go? Is APT a good investment? Let’s explore these questions in our Cryptopolitan price predictions from 2025 to 2031. Overview Cryptocurrency Aptos Symbol APT Current price $1.69 Aptos crypto market cap $1.27B Trading volume $105.83M Circulating supply 749.87M All-time high $19.90 on Jan 30, 2023 All-time low $2.22 on Oct 11, 2025 24-hour high $1.75 24-hour low $1.68 Aptos price prediction: Technical analysis Metric Value Volatility (30-day variation) 7.28% 50-day SMA $2.12 200-day SMA $4.05 Current APT crypto sentiment Bearish Green days 13/30 (43%) Fear and Greed Index 21 (Extreme Fear) Aptos price analysis At press time, December 31, Aptos traded at $1.69, up 0.84% in the previous 24 hours but down 6.80% in the last 30 days. Its trading volume rose by 15.90% over the previous 24-hours to $105.83M. Aptos 1-day chart price APTUSD chart by TradingView Aptos formed a bearish harami candle pattern in October, resulting in a major 24-hour drop to $0.747 from $5.12. It then made a quick correction above the $2.50 support level. The coin, however, maintained a bearish stance and continues to drop. The histograms (0.048) indicate positive market momentum. The William Alligator trendlines show that its volatility is dropping. Aptos 4-hour chart price analysis APTUSD chart by TradingView The 4-hour chart, like the daily chart, shows a neutral market with little volatility. The chart has formed red MACD histograms, indicating bearish momentum over the short term. Traders, however, are waiting to see if it breaks the $2.00 resistance level. Aptos technical indicators: Levels and action Daily simple moving average (SMA) Period Value ($) Action SMA 3 2.59 SELL SMA 5 2.27 SELL SMA 10 2.01 SELL SMA 21 1.81 SELL SMA 50 2.12 SELL SMA 100 2.98 SELL SMA 200 4.05 SELL Daily exponential moving average (EMA) Period Value ($) Action EMA 3 1.82 SELL EMA 5 2.09 SELL EMA 10 2.69 SELL EMA 21 3.38 SELL EMA 50 4.02 SELL EMA 100 4.46 SELL EMA 200 5.19 SELL What to expect from the APT price analysis next? According to the technical indicators, APT is bearish. On the charts, its momentum is neutral, and its volatility has dropped. Why is Aptos down? Aptos unlocked $19.8M tokens on December 12, releasing ~11.6M APT (1.5% of market cap) to core contributors, investors, and the community. New coins risk diluting the value of the coin. Recent news Binance Academy has launched a free online course in collaboration with Aptos Labs and the Aptos Foundation, designed for builders and enthusiasts of the network. Users who complete the course will share 3,500 APT in token vouchers. Will Aptos reach $10? Yes, Aptos rose above $10 this year. The move will come as the market recovers to previous highs.

Aptos historic price sentiment APT price history by CoinGecko Aptos raised seed funding in January 2022, led by a16z. Series A funding included Apollo, Dragonfly, Franklin Templeton, and others. Some members previously worked on the Diem blockchain proposed by Facebook. The Aptos mainnet launched in October 2022 with an initial supply of 1 billion tokens. After the launch hype, Apt fell to its lowest in December 2022, at $3.09. A month later, the tables turned, as it peaked at a time high of $19.90 on January 30, 2023. It pumped, partly driven by the NFT market. Collections such as Aptos Monkeys and Aptomingod have attracted more users. On June 6, it fell below its initial listing price and extended the losses in the preceding months. In October, it started correcting, rising as high as $8.47 in November. In 2024, it broke above $10, reaching $18 in March. From April, it reversed, falling below $10. By September, it had fallen as low as $6. It recovered in October, rising above $7.50.

The change hinges on a supply-change read of long-term holders (coins held longer than six months), which had been negative for months but has now turned modestly positive, said on-chain analyst Darkfost. Is This The Bitcoin Bottom Signal? Darkfost argues that recent claims about long-term holders “selling more than ever” miss what the data is actually showing, especially when large, discrete exchange-related movements skew the picture. “On this chart, which I adjusted to isolate the movement of nearly 800,000 BTC from Coinbase that was distorting LTH data, we can observe a clear shift in supply change,” Darkfost wrote. “Since July 16, the monthly LTH supply change (30 day sum) had been firmly anchored in a distribution phase until recently.” Related Reading: 2026 Bitcoin Price Predictions: What Banks, Institutions And Experts Forecast In plain terms, that meant the share of supply held by long-term holders had been declining for much of the second half of 2025, a regime that tends to coincide with persistent sell pressure as older coins rotate into the market. That phase, Darkfost said, has now ended, at least for the moment. “We have now moved back into positive territory, with around 10,700 BTC transitioning into long term held coins,” Darkfost wrote, calling it “a very modest change,” but “not insignificant.” The implication is that long-term holders have eased off distribution enough for their aggregate holdings to start rising again, even as short-term holders “continue to hold their BTC,” in Darkfost’s framing. CryptoQuant CEO Ki Young Ju echoed the directional takeaway in a shorter post, saying, “Bitcoin long-term holders stopped selling.” Related Reading: Bitcoin Risks A Year-Long Bear Market If This Happens: On-Chain Data VanEck’s head of digital research Matthew Sigel characterized the turn as a meaningful shift in positioning pressure via X. “BTC: Long-term holders turn net accumulators, easing a major Bitcoin headwind and ending, for now, the largest sell pressure event from this cohort since 2019,” Sigel wrote. Renowned expert James Van Straten added historical context to the scale of the move, saying the magnitude of distribution “marked the 2019 bottom as well,” suggesting the current inflection is notable even if it doesn’t, by itself, guarantee a repeat. Darkfost also pointed to historical patterning around these flips. “Historically, such shifts have often preceded the formation of consolidation phases or even bullish recoveries, depending on how the broader trend evolves,” he wrote, emphasizing conditions rather than certainty. At press time, BTC traded at $88,623.

Meanwhile, the project’s underlying asset continues to show strength around the pivotal support level at around $0.20, and there are some hints about a potential resurgence. Holiday Cheers CryptoPotato reported recently Pi Network’s Holiday move, called the Community Commerce Initiative, in which it invited its user base to participate and take advantage of discounts in certain apps and merchants that accept the PI token. The team also hosted a community raffle to make the new movement more exciting, featuring Pi-branded merchandise, including T-shirts and hats. In a subsequent post, the Core Team provided more details on the move via a video on X and outlined the Holiday design update for one of the popular Pi-native games, FruityPi. They said the new version is refreshed with new music, animations, and user engagement. Before that, Pi Network highlighted significant updates to two of its systems in development – the testnet decentralized exchange (DEX) and the Automated Market Maker (AMM). Perhaps the most notable change involved the shift toward Pi-denominated liquidity pairs, which aims to position the project’s native token as the primary base asset across the testnet exchange. It mirrors liquidity models from other, more established DeFi ecosystems, where concentrating liquidity around a dominant asset reduces fragmentation and should improve price stability. The team further informed that both the DEX and AMM interfaces have received refreshed looks, which should simplify navigation and reduce friction for newcomers. Will PI Rebound Soon? The aforementioned price stability for PI has indeed arrived, at least according to the asset’s most recent moves. Ever since the October and November volatility, in which the token pumped toward $0.30 only to be rejected and driven south, it has remained sideways at just over $0.20 with a few brief deviations. That support has held during the recent market calmness, and PI now sits inches above it after a minor daily increase of around 1%. Recent exchange movements indicate that investors have been pulling out tokens from trading platforms, which could also ease the selling pressure, and perhaps be among the catalysts of a price revival. Something else that could boost PI’s price movements is a possible listing on the world’s largest crypto exchange, Binance. In this article, we review the odds of such a development through the eyes of AI platforms.

The launch of the Midnight sidechain in December 2025 adds a new dimension to the ecosystem, positioning Cardano to address privacy use cases that have so far remained largely outside its core offering. This analysis is powered by Outset PR , a crypto-native PR agency that leverages data and market timing to help Web3 projects make the most of every moment. Midnight Introduces Privacy-Preserving Smart Contracts Midnight is Cardano’s privacy-focused sidechain designed to support confidential smart contracts and transactions. At its core is the NIGHT token, which powers private execution while maintaining selective auditability. Unlike privacy-first blockchains such as Monero or Zcash, Midnight allows users to keep transaction details confidential while still enabling compliance and verification when required. This balance between privacy and auditability sets Midnight apart and aligns more closely with enterprise and regulated use cases. Potential Gateway for Bitcoin DeFi Users One of Midnight’s longer-term implications lies in cross-chain adoption. By supporting wrapped Bitcoin integrations, the protocol could attract Bitcoin holders seeking access to decentralized finance without fully exposing transaction data on public ledgers. If this flow materializes, Cardano could benefit indirectly. Increased activity on Midnight would rely on ADA as the settlement and security layer, expanding ADA’s role beyond staking and base-layer transactions. This dynamic positions ADA as infrastructure rather than just a transactional asset, potentially strengthening its relevance within a multi-chain environment. Utility Expansion Versus Regulatory Risk While the technology opens new adoption paths, regulatory scrutiny remains a clear risk. Privacy-focused tools continue to attract attention from regulators, particularly in jurisdictions with strict compliance frameworks. Midnight’s design attempts to address this by enabling optional disclosure and auditability, but its success will depend on how regulators interpret and respond to these features. Widespread adoption may hinge as much on regulatory clarity as on technical execution. How Outset PR Leverages Data-Driven Approach in Crypto PR Outset PR connects market events with meaningful storytelling through a data-driven methodology rarely seen in the crypto communications space. Founded by PR strategist Mike Ermolaev, the agency approaches each campaign like a hands-on workshop—building narratives that align with market momentum instead of relying on generic coverage or templated outreach. Beyond just monitoring on-chain flows, Outset PR monitors the media trendlines and traffic distribution through the lens of its proprietary Outset Data Pulse intelligence to determine when a client’s message will achieve the highest lift. This analysis informs the choice of media outlets, the angle of each pitch, and the timing of publication. A key part of the agency’s workflow comes from its proprietary Syndication Map , an internal analytics system that identifies which publications deliver the strongest downstream syndication across aggregators such as CoinMarketCap and Binance Square. Because of this approach, Outset PR campaigns frequently achieve visibility several times higher than their initial placements. Outset PR ensures that each campaign is market-fit and tailored to deliver maximum relevance at the moment the audience is most receptive. Cardano Outlook for 2026 Cardano’s Midnight launch gives the ecosystem a concrete growth narrative heading into 2026. If privacy-preserving smart contracts gain traction and attract Bitcoin DeFi users, ADA’s utility could expand meaningfully as a settlement asset. However, adoption is not guaranteed. Regulatory pressure and the pace of developer uptake will play a decisive role. Midnight strengthens Cardano’s long-term positioning, but its impact on ADA will ultimately depend on real-world usage rather than technical promise alone.

The TSLA stock had already gone through a sharp swing this year. Shares slid in April after Elon Musk’s political activity raised questions about his focus on running the automaker. Since then, Tesla has rebounded hard and now trades near record highs, despite rising concern around vehicle demand and slowing deliveries. Tesla publishes delivery estimates as sales pressure builds Tesla added to the debate on Monday when it abruptly published vehicle delivery estimates on its website. That step stood out. The company usually shares this data privately with analysts and investors. The numbers pointed to a second straight annual decline in vehicle sales, as Tesla compiled an average estimate of 1.6 million deliveries, a drop of more than 8% from the prior year. The outlook for the next three years also came in below averages tracked by Bloomberg, showing weaker momentum than many investors had priced in. For the fourth quarter, analysts expect Tesla to deliver 422,850 vehicles, according to data posted by the company. That would be a 15% fall from the same period last year. Bloomberg’s average stood higher at 440,907 vehicles, which still implied an 11% annual decline. Tesla had not published these averages before, even though its investor relations team has long compiled similar data behind the scenes. Despite the sales slowdown, Tesla stock has held up, surging 11% through Tuesday’s close, even as the S&P 500 gained 17% over the same period. The gap shows investors remain willing to pay for future growth, even as delivery volumes soften. Elon Musk defends Tesla scale while Burry stays skeptical of AI While delivery estimates triggered bearish argument, Elon Musk continued posting on X, saying, “Tesla Model Y is now officially the world’s best-selling car for the third year in a row.” In another, Elon addressed criticism tied to his $1 trillion pay package, which shareholders approved at an October meeting. “My Tesla and SpaceX shares, which are almost all my wealth, only go up in value as a function of how much useful product those companies produce and service,” Elon wrote . He added that shareholders and employees benefit from stock gains and described himself as “a maker, not a taker,” targeting politicians like Bernie Sanders. Meanwhile, Michael remains with short positions on Nvidia, Palantir, and Google, arguing that AI has turned into a bubble. He has said, in his new Substack “Cassandra Unchained,” he does not believe AI demand will justify current valuations and expects the trade to unwind next year.

Optimism price prediction for 2028 suggests the token could reach a maximum value of $2.02. In 2031, OP tokens will range between $3.04 and $3.29, with an average value of $3.16. Optimism’s (OP) commitment to innovation is highlighted by its support for Layer-3 solutions. These solutions enable the development of decentralized applications (dApps) on top of Layer-2 chains, contributing to the expansive Optimism Superchain. The platform’s initiatives, including introducing custom gas tokens and Plasma mode aimed at reducing onboarding and operational costs, make it more accessible for new users and developers. As the market closely watches the price movements and growth trajectory of the token, can Optimism reach $10 soon? Let’s get into the OP price prediction for 2025 – 2031. Overview Cryptocurrency Optimism Token OP Price $0.2698 Market Cap $523.26M Trading Volume $55.50M Circulating Supply 1.944B OP All-time High $4.85 (Mar 06, 2024) All-time Low $0.2544 (Oct 10, 2025) 24-hour High $0.2752 24-hour Low $0.2673 Optimism price prediction: Technical analysis Metric Value Volatility (30-day Variation) 7.56% (High) 50-Day SMA $0.3408 14-Day RSI 40.55 (Neutral) Sentiment Bearish Fear & Greed Index 23 (Extreme Fear) Green Days 11/30 (37%) 200-Day SMA $0.6370 Optimism price analysis TL;DR Breakdown: OP is consolidating after a selloff. Bulls must reclaim $0.278 for any meaningful price movement. If OP breaks below $0.260, downside risk accelerates fast. Optimism 1-day price chart As of December 31, OP is trading around $0.269, sitting below the daily mid-Bollinger band near $0.278, which continues to act as dynamic resistance. The broader structure remains bearish, but the sharp downside momentum has slowed after the bounce from the lower band around $0.247–$0.250. OPUSDT 1-day price chart by TradingView The price is now compressing sideways, signaling indecision rather than continuation. CMF remains negative, implying capital is still flowing out, though the selling pressure is no longer aggressive. A daily close above $0.278 would be the first meaningful signal of trend relief, while a loss of $0.260 risks reopening the path toward $0.245. Optimism 4-hour price chart On the 4-hour chart, OP is stuck beneath the Alligator cluster around $0.271–$0.272, confirming short-term bearish control. Recent candles show shrinking ranges, indicating volatility compression and a lack of conviction from both sides. OPUSDT 4-hour price chart by TradingView The MACD remains slightly negative with flat histograms, reinforcing that momentum is weak rather than impulsively bearish. As long as price holds below $0.272, rallies are likely to be sold into, but failure to break below $0.268 suggests sellers are also losing strength. Optimism technical indicators: Levels and action Daily simple moving average (SMA) Period Value Action SMA 3 $0.4215 SELL SMA 5 $0.3619 SELL SMA 10 $0.3307 SELL SMA 21 $0.3137 SELL SMA 50 $0.3252 SELL SMA 100 $0.4303 SELL SMA 200 $0.6370 SELL Daily exponential moving average (EMA) Period Value Action EMA 3 $0.2968 SELL EMA 5 $0.3290 SELL EMA 10 $0.4121 SELL EMA 21 $0.5235 SELL EMA 50 $0.6157 SELL EMA 100 $0.6673 SELL EMA 200 $0.8182 SELL What to expect from Optimism? OP is coiling in a tight range, and this compression typically precedes a directional move. A reclaim and hold above $0.278–$0.280 would likely trigger a relief push toward $0.295–$0.300, while rejection and a clean breakdown below $0.260 would expose $0.245 quickly. Is Optimism a good crypto investment? Optimism (OP) could be a good investment if you believe in Ethereum scaling and the growth of Layer 2 solutions. However, like all crypto, it’s risky, and its value depends on adoption and market trends. Only invest what you’re willing to lose! Will OP recover? A recovery is possible, but we fear the overall bearish sentiment makes a short-term rebound unlikely. However, as the market consolidates, we expect reduced volatility, which may lead to a breakout in either direction, depending on market dynamics. Will OP reach $50? Reaching $50 for Optimism (OP) would be an ambitious target, requiring a significant increase in its price. This level would likely only be achievable in a highly favorable market environment, with substantial advancements in Ethereum adoption, widespread use of Layer 2 solutions, and strong overall market growth. Will OP reach $100? Reaching $100 for Optimism (OP) would be extremely ambitious and require unprecedented growth and adoption. Does Optimism have a good long-term future? Yes, Optimism shows strong potential for growth and sustained interest, indicating a positive long-term outlook.

Optimism historic price sentiment Optimism price history by Coingecko OP launched with an initial value of $4.57 on May 31 but dropped sharply in June due to the UST stablecoin de-pegging and LUNA collapse, closing June at $0.5434. It further declined to $0.4147 by mid-July. In August, OP briefly surged above $1.90, but by mid-October, it dropped to $0.70 following the FTX collapse. In Q1 2023, OP surged past $3.00 during a crypto bull run but lost 66% shortly after. A recovery saw it close the year at $3.90. OP saw an eventful 2024, reaching an all-time high of $4.85 in March before sliding below $2.30 by mid-April. After a brief recovery to over $2.90 in May, it entered a bearish phase, trading at $1.82–$1.96 by July and $1.54–$1.62 by October. November brought a spark of hope with a peak at $2.60. OP closed December within the range of $1.611–$2.773. In January 2025, OP peaked at $2.18 but lost momentum, dropping to as low as $0.84 in February. OP peaked at $0.9346 in March, $0.8523 in May, $0.7478 in June, and in July, $0.86. In August, OP traded between $0.6178 and $0.880, and in September, it maintained an average price of $0.74. In November, OP traded between $0.2888 – $0.4516, and in December, the coin is trading between $0.2673 – $0.2752.",Crypto Price Predictions|Optimism,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|BUSINESS|ETH|ICO|LUNA|MARKET|TRADING|RESEARCH|OP|FORKS|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-12-31 08:51:00

In contrast, Prenetics stopped its Bitcoin buying program to refocus capital on scaling its fast-growing nutrition brand IM8. Cypherpunk Bets Big on Zcash Nasdaq-listed Cypherpunk Technologies expanded its corporate crypto treasury with a new acquisition of Zcash. The company revealed that it purchased 56,418 ZEC for approximately $29 million, paying an average price of about $514 per token. After the transaction, Cypherpunk’s total Zcash holdings now stand at roughly 290,062.67 ZEC, which is about 1.76% of the cryptocurrency’s circulating supply. The firm has made clear that this is not a one-off purchase, and chief investment officer Will McEvoy stated that Cypherpunk ultimately wants to accumulate 5% of the total ZEC supply. Announcement from Cypherpunk The acquisition follows Cypherpunk’s recent transformation from its former identity as biotech firm Leap Therapeutics. The company rebranded in November as a Zcash-focused digital asset company, which has been well received by markets. Since the rebrand, Cypherpunk’s stock climbed by nearly 170%, rising from around $0.44 to roughly $1.18, according to CoinCodex data . The company is backed by Winklevoss Capital, the investment arm of Gemini founders Tyler Winklevoss and Cameron Winklevoss. Zcash launched in 2016 as a Bitcoin fork, and is designed to enable private transactions using zero-knowledge proofs that conceal the sender, recipient, and transaction amount. Like Bitcoin, Zcash has a capped supply of 21 million tokens, a feature that appeals to investors looking for scarcity alongside enhanced privacy. The token’s recent price performance has been quite impressive. In fact, ZEC surged by almost 800% over the past year to trade above $525, according to CoinCodex data . By comparison, Bitcoin has declined by roughly 5% over the same period. ZEC price action over the past year (Source: CoinCodex ) The rally in Zcash coincided with renewed global debate around privacy in the digital age, driven by advances in artificial intelligence, data collection, and surveillance technologies. Several influential crypto commentators , including former BitMEX CEO Arthur Hayes and Helius co-founder Mert Mumtaz, pointed to Zcash’s privacy features as a key reason for its outperformance relative to other altcoins. Zcash Foundation executive director Alex Bornstein also argued that the momentum reflects organic demand tied to growing unease over government overreach and digital transparency. Despite the bullish narrative, some analysts still urge caution. Crypto analyst Eric Van Tassel warned that a corrective pullback toward the $400 level is still possible in the near term. Prenetics Pauses Bitcoin Treasury Strategy While Cypherpunk Technologies is forging ahead with its treasury strategy, other companies are taking a step back. Nasdaq-listed Prenetics Global Limited stopped its Bitcoin treasury buying program, ending a daily accumulation strategy that was announced in June. The decision is a clear pivot away from crypto balance-sheet expansion and toward scaling IM8, a nutrition brand co-founded with former football star David Beckham. According to a statement that was released Tuesday, Prenetics paused its Bitcoin purchases on Dec. 4 and does not plan to acquire any more BTC. The company said its capital and operational focus will instead center on growing IM8, which sells an all-in-one daily nutrition supplement. Prenetics said IM8 surpassed $100 million in annualized recurring revenue within just 11 months of launch, which appears to have driven the strategic shift. Statement from Prenetics Despite halting new purchases, Prenetics will keep its existing Bitcoin holdings. The company currently holds 510 BTC on its balance sheet, alongside more than $70 million in cash and cash equivalents. In June, Prenetics launched its Bitcoin reserve strategy with an initial $20 million investment, acquiring roughly 187 BTC at an average price of $106,712 per coin. Shares of Prenetics fell 3.32% in Tuesday trading on Nasdaq after the announcement, though the stock is still up nearly 170% year to date, according to CoinCodex data . Prenetics YTD share price (Source: CoinCodex ) The move comes as corporate Bitcoin adoption continues to expand across public markets. Data from BitcoinTreasuries.NET shows that 192 publicly traded companies now hold Bitcoin, collectively owning close to 1.1 million BTC. A big portion of that total is held by Strategy, the firm led by Michael Saylor that pioneered the corporate Bitcoin treasury model in 2020. After its latest purchase, Strategy now holds 672,497 BTC. Speaking on a podcast Tuesday, Strategy chief financial officer Andrew Kang said the company is still very much committed to buying and holding Bitcoin. Not everyone shares that optimism.

The event follows the company’s long-standing, pre-scheduled supply mechanism and is closely monitored by investors , despite being a routine and well-telegraphed occurrence. Introduced in 2017, the escrow system was designed to ensure transparency and predictability in XRP’s supply. Each month, up to 1 billion XRP is unlocked from time-locked contracts, but Ripple typically uses only a portion for operations, ecosystem growth, and liquidity, while returning most of the tokens to escrow under new locks. Historically, Ripple has relocked about 60% to 80% of each release, or roughly 600 million to 800 million XRP. As a result, only an estimated 200 million to 400 million XRP is usually available outside escrow, limiting the immediate impact on circulating supply. Because the bulk of the unlocked XRP is usually relocked, the headline figure often overstates the true market effect. As a result, the XRP price has historically reacted mutedly to escrow releases. Impact on XRP price However, the first unlock of the year can still influence short-term sentiment, especially during periods of low liquidity or broader market uncertainty. This comes at a time when XRP’s price has been weighed down by weak sentiment across the broader cryptocurrency market . By press time, the token was trading at $1.87, having modestly rallied by nearly 0.4% over the past 24 hours, while gaining almost 1% over the past week. XRP seven-day price chart. Source: Finbold At the current price, XRP is trading well below its 50-day simple moving average ( SMA ) of $2.07 and its 200-day SMA of $2.49. This positioning below both short- and long-term moving averages signals continued downward pressure and the potential extension of the downtrend, as the price has yet to reclaim these key resistance levels. Complementing this, the 14-day relative strength index ( RSI ) stands at 42.74, remaining in neutral territory. While it does not signal extreme overbought or oversold conditions, the sub-50 reading points to underlying weakness amid broader market uncertainty.

Here’s What Could Happen Next,https://timestabloid.com/xrp-enters-a-rare-technical-zone-heres-what-could-happen-next/,"XRP has returned to a condition that rarely appears on high time horizons. Its price has cooled, and attention has shifted from short-term swings to deeper and rarer signals. One of those signals has now surfaced on the 3-week chart, suggesting a meaningful shift in momentum rather than a routine pullback. Crypto analyst Steph Is Crypto (@Steph_iscrypto) focused on that shift in a recent post, highlighting a technical development that last appeared at a critical moment in XRP’s history. On $XRP ’s 3-week timeframe, the Stochastic RSI has dropped to 0.00. That’s extremely rare and has only happened once before — at the 2022 bear market bottom. On such a high timeframe, this indicator only reaches zero when selling pressure is fully exhausted. It means… pic.twitter.com/pvO7pQl0mK — STEPH IS CRYPTO (@Steph_iscrypto) December 29, 2025 An Extreme Reading for XRP Steph Is Crypto pointed to the Stochastic RSI on XRP’s 3-week timeframe dropping to 0.00. He described the signal as “extremely rare” and noted that it “has only happened once before” during the 2022 bear market bottom. On higher timeframes, the indicator moves slowly and filters out short-lived noise. A move to zero reflects a market where downside momentum has fully unwound. Steph explained that this condition does not require an immediate price reversal. He said it shows selling pressure has reached exhaustion and downward momentum has dried up. According to his post, the previous appearance of this signal preceded a prolonged accumulation phase before XRP moved higher. Why the 3-Week Signal Matters The 3-week chart captures the structural trend. Indicators on this scale only reset when positioning changes over months. A Stochastic RSI reading of 0.00 means recent closes sit at the weakest end of their range over a long lookback period. When this occurs after an extended decline, it often reflects sellers stepping aside rather than accelerating their sales. Steph emphasized that the signal marked a transition in 2022 at the bottom of the bear market. However, XRP did not surge immediately. Accumulation followed as volatility faded. That process allowed stronger hands to absorb supply without chasing the price higher. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 What the Signal Suggests for XRP Now Seeing the same condition again suggests downside risk has narrowed on a structural basis. Long-term holders appear to absorb supply rather than distribute it. That does not eliminate short-term volatility. It does reduce the probability of sustained downside without a new shock. XRP currently trades near $1.94 on the chart shown. Price remains well above the 2022 lows. However, it is much lower than its peak in July , and momentum has reset. With the market now building toward another breakout, we may soon see a change in XRP’s trajectory. Disclaimer : This content is meant to inform and should not be considered financial advice.

Bitcoin (BTC) and major altcoins are experiencing their lowest two-week trading volume since December 2024, with weekly activity for assets like Ethereum (ETH) and Solana (SOL) down more than 50% compared to last year’s holiday period. Holiday Lull Drags Volumes to Yearly Lows Data shared by Santiment on X on December 30 showed trading volume sliding steadily through the final weeks of 2025, with both Bitcoin and altcoins recording their quietest two-week stretch since the same period last year. The analytics firm said that flat, erratic price movement, combined with year-end holidays, has pulled traders away from screens, draining liquidity across spot and derivatives markets. The drop is especially visible among altcoins. Santiment noted that ETH, SOL, Cardano (ADA), and Dogecoin (DOGE) are now seeing less than half of their weekly trading volume compared with late 2024, when speculative activity remained elevated even during the holidays. According to Santiment, this year’s drop points to weaker short-term interest rather than panic selling. Social data also tells a similar story. A post by Oro Crypto, citing Santiment metrics, highlighted a steady fall in Bitcoin social volume since mid-November. The numbers show that discussions across major platforms have thinned, reactions to price swings have dulled, and even volatile sessions have failed to draw attention. Meanwhile, Bitcoin’s social dominance has also slipped into low single-digit territory, suggesting fragmented focus rather than hype concentrated around a single asset. Oro Crypto said this environment looks more like exhaustion than fear. Historically, major cycle peaks have coincided with loud narratives and heavy retail participation, but those signals are currently missing, even as prices fluctuate within wide bands. Diverging Signals for the New Year While the immediate technicals appear concerning, some observers have pointed to broader macroeconomic patterns as a reason for optimism. A recent analysis drew a parallel to mid-2020, when gold and silver rallied vigorously on central bank liquidity before capital rotated into Bitcoin, triggering a historic bull run. Today, with gold hitting record highs above $4,500 and silver also reaching new peaks, the same sequence could be unfolding. This perspective frames the metals’ strength not as a risk-off warning, but as a leading indicator that risk assets like BTC may follow in 2026, supported by potential rate cuts and clearer regulation. Still, on the charts, Bitcoin’s immediate path remains contested. Trading around $88,000, the asset is caught in a tightening pattern, with one trader noting that Bitcoin must break above $90,600 to open a path toward $107,000. However, if support fails to hold, the market may test levels between $70,000 and $65,000. The convergence of low volumes, social apathy, and critical technical levels means the market’s current silence is unlikely to last. As such, the defining story of early 2026 will be whether it breaks upward into a new rally or downward into a deeper correction.

But here’s the problem: Nvidia only has 700,000 units available right now, so it had to go back to its main foundry partner, TSMC, asking them to speed up production. Three people familiar with the situation allegedly told Reuters that TSMC has been asked to start making more H200 units, with production expected to begin by the second quarter of 2026. The order rush could strain global AI chip supply again. While Nvidia tries to satisfy Chinese demand, it still has to support customers elsewhere. Things are even riskier because Beijing hasn’t approved the chips for import. Cryptopolitan reported in November that President Donald Trump’s administration lifted the U.S. export ban, allowing H200 shipments to China, but with a 25% fee. Chinese firms order millions of chips as Nvidia balances supply gaps The talks with TSMC, as well as the size and price of Chinese orders, have not been reported before. Nvidia has priced the H200 chips at around $27,000 each, depending on the buyer and order size. Two sources said the company will offer two chip variants to Chinese customers: the standalone H200 and the GH200 Grace Hopper superchip, which combines the Grace CPU with the Hopper GPU. Of the 700,000 units Nvidia currently has, about 100,000 are GH200s, with the rest being H200. The first deliveries will come from this existing inventory and are scheduled to reach clients before the Lunar New Year holiday in mid-February. Additional supply will follow once TSMC ramps up. Chinese firms view the H200 as a serious step up from what they can currently access. The now-blocked H20, a weaker chip made specifically for the Chinese market, is no longer available after Beijing banned it. But the H200 delivers roughly six times the performance, according to people familiar with the matter. The eight-chip module is priced at about 1.5 million yuan, more than the H20’s 1.2 million yuan price tag. Even so, it’s still cheaper than gray-market options, which are going for over 1.75 million yuan. ByteDance is already gearing up to spend 100 billion yuan on Nvidia’s chips in 2026, up from 85 billion yuan in 2025, if Chinese regulators approve the H200 imports. Beijing still undecided on greenlighting incoming chip shipments Despite the U.S. now allowing H200 exports, Chinese regulators haven’t given the all-clear. They’re worried that letting in more advanced foreign chips could slow progress in China’s own semiconductor sector. Officials haven’t blocked the shipments, but they haven’t signed off either. Local chipmakers have built products that match the H20, but nothing yet rivals the H200. One idea that’s reportedly being discussed in Beijing is to tie every imported H200 chip to a mandatory purchase of a set amount of locally made chips. This plan would let China’s domestic players stay in the game while letting internet giants like ByteDance keep scaling up. Nvidia responded to a request for comment saying it manages its supply chain actively. A company spokesperson added, “Licensed sales of the H200 to authorised customers in China will have no impact on our ability to supply customers in the United States.” The spokesperson also reportedly said, “China is a highly competitive market with rapidly growing local chip suppliers. Blocking all U.S. exports undercut our national and economic security and only benefited foreign competition.” The H200 is part of Nvidia’s Hopper architecture and is made using TSMC’s 4-nanometer process. Even though Nvidia is also working on newer chips like Blackwell and the upcoming Rubin, this sudden surge in Chinese demand is pushing it to expand H200 output fast. Sources said Nvidia hasn’t finalized exactly how many more chips it’ll ask TSMC to build, but the target is to keep up with massive demand while avoiding deeper supply shortages in other regions. That balance just got a lot trickier.

56637195,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=257426,1767173111,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,"Bybit Delisting Triggers Strategic Shift: ELX, ODOS, DMAIL Tokens to Be Removed",https://bitcoinworld.co.in/bybit-delisting-elx-odos-dmail/,"BitcoinWorld Bybit Delisting Triggers Strategic Shift: ELX, ODOS, DMAIL Tokens to Be Removed In a significant move for the digital asset sector, leading cryptocurrency exchange Bybit has announced the impending delisting of three spot trading pairs. Consequently, traders must prepare for the removal of ELX, ODOS, and DMAIL from the platform at 8:00 a.m. UTC on January 7, 2025. This decision, while impactful, reflects the dynamic and evolving standards within the global crypto trading landscape. Furthermore, it underscores the exchange’s commitment to maintaining a robust and compliant marketplace for its users. Bybit Delisting Announcement: Core Details and Timeline Bybit issued a formal notice to its global user base regarding the delisting process. The exchange will suspend spot trading for the ELX/USDT, ODOS/USDT, and DMAIL/USDT pairs precisely at the designated time. Subsequently, the platform will execute the automatic cancellation of all pending orders for these pairs. Users then retain a one-week grace period to withdraw their ELX, ODOS, and DMAIL tokens from their Bybit wallets. After this withdrawal window closes, the exchange may convert any remaining balances to USDT at its discretion, a common industry practice for post-delisting asset management. This action is not an isolated event. Major exchanges routinely review listed assets against a stringent set of criteria. For instance, these criteria often include trading volume, liquidity depth, project development activity, and commitment to regulatory compliance. Regular audits ensure the marketplace’s overall health and security. Therefore, the delisting of ELX, ODOS, and DMAIL likely follows a comprehensive quarterly review cycle. Understanding Common Delisting Criteria Exchanges like Bybit typically evaluate tokens based on several quantifiable metrics. A sustained decline in trading volume often signals diminished market interest. Similarly, low liquidity can lead to excessive price slippage, harming the trader experience. Moreover, projects must demonstrate ongoing technical development and responsive community management. Finally, adherence to evolving global regulatory standards has become a non-negotiable factor for reputable platforms. Tokens failing to meet these benchmarks risk removal to protect investors and uphold market integrity. Analyzing the Impacted Tokens: ELX, ODOS, and DMAIL The delisting decision directly affects three distinct digital assets. A brief analysis of each provides context for Bybit’s strategic review. ELX (Elixir): Often associated with decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols, tokens like ELX may face volatility based on protocol usage and broader DeFi trends. ODOS (Odos Finance): This token typically relates to a decentralized asset router. Its performance is frequently tied to the efficiency and adoption of its underlying aggregation technology. DMAIL (Dmail Network): Representing a Web3 communication layer, DMAIL’s value proposition connects blockchain-based messaging with user activity. Historically, delisting announcements can trigger short-term price volatility for the affected assets. Trading activity may spike before the deadline, followed by potential liquidity challenges on other supporting exchanges. However, the long-term viability of a project depends fundamentally on its utility and development roadmap, not solely on a single exchange listing. Strategic Implications for the Cryptocurrency Market Bybit’s action highlights a maturing industry trend. Exchanges are increasingly prioritizing quality over quantity in their listed assets. This curation enhances market stability and user protection. For retail traders, this news serves as a critical reminder to conduct thorough due diligence. Diversifying holdings across multiple reputable platforms can mitigate the risk associated with any single exchange’s policy changes. For the projects themselves, a delisting can be a pivotal moment. It may prompt a reevaluation of tokenomics, partnership strategies, and exchange relations. Successful projects often use such events to strengthen community engagement and accelerate development milestones. The broader market interprets these exchange decisions as signals of evolving standards, potentially influencing investment flows toward projects with stronger fundamentals. Expert Perspective on Exchange Governance Industry analysts note that proactive delistings are a hallmark of responsible exchange governance. “A rigorous listing review process is essential for ecosystem health,” explains a veteran market strategist. “It protects users from low-liquidity traps and projects that have become inactive. While disruptive for some holders, these measures ultimately foster a more trustworthy and sustainable trading environment for everyone.” This perspective aligns with global regulatory pushes for greater transparency and investor protection in digital asset markets. Actionable Steps for Affected Traders Users holding ELX, ODOS, or DMAIL on Bybit must take specific actions before the deadlines. First, cease any open orders for these pairs immediately. Second, plan to withdraw the tokens to a private, self-custody wallet that supports them before the withdrawal window closes. Alternatively, traders can convert the assets to another cryptocurrency like USDT or BTC on Bybit prior to the trading halt. Finally, investors should research other exchanges where these tokens remain listed if they wish to continue trading them, always verifying the security and reputation of any alternative platform. Bybit Delisting Timeline and Key Actions Date & Time (UTC) Event Recommended User Action Jan 7, 2025, 8:00 a.m. Spot trading suspended. Orders canceled. Ensure no active trades remain. Jan 7 – Jan 14, 2025 Withdrawal period open. Withdraw tokens to private wallet. After Jan 14, 2025 Remaining balances may be converted. Complete withdrawals before this date. Conclusion The Bybit delisting of ELX, ODOS, and DMAIL marks a standard yet important operational update in the cryptocurrency industry. This decision reinforces the exchange’s dedication to market quality and regulatory alignment. For traders, it emphasizes the necessity of proactive portfolio management and understanding the terms of service on their chosen platforms. As the digital asset space continues to evolve, such curated actions by major exchanges are likely to continue, shaping a more resilient and mature global market for all participants. FAQs Q1: What happens to my ELX tokens on Bybit after January 7? After trading stops, you can withdraw them until January 14. Following that, Bybit may automatically convert any remaining balance to USDT. Q2: Can I still trade ELX, ODOS, or DMAIL elsewhere after the Bybit delisting? Yes, provided other cryptocurrency exchanges continue to list these tokens. You must check each token’s official channels or coin tracking websites for alternative trading venues. Q3: Why would an exchange like Bybit delist a token? Common reasons include consistently low trading volume and liquidity, lack of project development progress, failure to meet updated compliance standards, or security concerns. Q4: Will the price of these tokens definitely drop because of the delisting? While delisting news often creates selling pressure, the long-term price depends on the project’s fundamentals and its standing on other platforms. Short-term volatility is common. Q5: Is my money safe if I don’t withdraw the tokens before the deadline? Your assets are not lost. However, if Bybit converts them to USDT after the deadline, the conversion rate is at the exchange’s discretion, which may not match the market price on other platforms.

This New Altcoin Could Be the Best Pick for Q1 2026,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/next-big-crypto-to-hit-1-this-new-altcoin-could-be-the-best-pick-for-q1-2026/,"With the future of the market trending in 2026, the question that is being raised by many investors is what is the best crypto to invest in today and grow over the long term? It is a fact that big moves usually precede actual improvement in prices. Market commentators allude that instead of running with what is already running, one should monitor projects that have just left planning to run. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has also become a name that has repeatedly been used in such debates as a DeFi cryptocurrency with a real financial use-case, as opposed to the hype of short-term excitement. What Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Is Mutuum Finance is a decentralized lending and borrowing protocol that is being developed with balance and predictability as the pillars. Users can provide assets to receive yield or borrow on security without selling the assets. As the users provide assets, they are issued with mtTokens. These tokens are the manifestation of their location and their growth in value when interest paid back by the borrowers into the system unwinds. The borrowers get access to the liquidity with the defined rules, the collateral requirements and liquidation thresholds that secure the protocol. The team is in development of V1 of the lending and borrowing platform with a beta that will roll out into the Sepolia testnet. This will enable the community to directly test the protocol with ETH and USDT. Security has been a major development factor. Funds Raised and Price Development Mutuum Finance has already collected $19.5M and received 18,700 investors. This is important since extensive participation usually signifies a feeling of assurance among numerous sizes of wallet instead of the overdependence on a limited group. The initial token price was $0.01. The price of MUTM is at present $0.04 and this is the 300% increase over the initial stage. According to the commentators of the market, such kind of growth as achieved prior to total access to the products is a possible indication of faith in the road map and not short term trading. To crypto price observers in the current day, appreciation of prices can fluctuate in relation to development, as illustrated in this pattern of the price. There are some critics who hold that further implementation might enable MUTM to push it further once it is adopted, particularly, in case the metrics of their use are measured after implementation. Distribution of Tokens and Participation The amount of MUTM supplied amounts to 4B tokens. There are 45.5% or approximately 1.82B tokens of that part that are distributed early on. This is important to determine the extent of supply to the market before the wider trading starts. Engagement incentives have also been introduced in Mutuum Finance. It will have a 24-hour leaderboard, which rewards the leader of the day with $500 in MUTM to ensure an individual participates daily rather than a single day. Moreover, it also accepts card payments, reducing the barrier to entry of new users who desire exposure and do not have to go through difficult on-chain procedures. Investors considering the option of investing in a crypto project usually consider access as a major factor in the long-term adoption than anticipated. CertiK Audit and Stablecoin Trust is still a major influence in crypto investment. Mutuum Finance has a CertiK 90100 CertiK Token Scan Score, which facilitates the building of trust in the format of the token. Such an overall score, coupled with the filled out Halborn review , makes the project one of the ones that focus on security initially. Another key area is the stablecoins. Mutuum Finance will also lend stablecoins: this is one of the developing roadmap use cases. Stablecoins make borrowing and lending deflated with uncertainty and allow the activity to remain steady when other markets are active and volatile. It is believed by many analysts that the lending of stablecoins will continue to be one of the best growing resources of DeFi in the following cycle. The Importance of Timing Phase 6 of MUTM distribution was sold out very fast and this is one of the reasons that the commentators in the market see it as an indicator of an increasing demand. Timing is of the essence to those in need of the potential next big crypto or the most promising cryptocurrency to invest in before the first quarter of 2026. According to some analysts, in case Mutuum Finance keeps on achieving its roadmap and it is adopted, price levels as we will have to live in today might be quite different in 2026. Although no result can be predicted, the stir of funds, active purchasers, scrutinized code and an imminent V1 launch is the reason why MUTM is becoming a legitimate name amongst a growing number of DeFi initiatives that are setting their eyes on the subsequent phase of market development.

Hoskinson Says RWA Is The Key,https://www.newsbtc.com/altcoin/crypto-headed-for-a-10-trillion-future-hoskinson-says-rwa-is-the-key/,"Charles Hoskinson isn’t backing away from big predictions. The Cardano founder says crypto is still early, despite years of growth and repeated boom-and-bust cycles. In his view, the industry is setting up for something much larger—both in size and in reach. Related Reading: Crypto Heat Fizzling Out? US Search Interest Plunges As Retail Shy Away Today, crypto counts more than 500 million users worldwide. The combined market value already sits in the trillions, with Bitcoin alone worth about $1.75 trillion. That’s impressive, but Hoskinson argues it’s nowhere near the finish line. He believes the sector can grow to 2 billion users and hit a $10 trillion total valuation. That’s a fourfold jump in adoption and more than triple today’s market size. His timeline is clear too. Hoskinson says this could happen within the next 10 years, by 2035. Why Hoskinson Thinks Crypto Explodes From Here The key driver, according to Hoskinson, is real-world asset tokenization, often called RWA. It’s the idea of putting traditional assets—like bonds, property, and commodities—onto blockchains. This isn’t theoretical anymore. Data from RWA.xyz shows close to $20 billion worth of assets, including bonds and real estate, have already been tokenized. That number keeps climbing, even during slow market periods. UPDATE: #Cardano $ADA Founder Charles Hoskinson says the crypto industry will “grow to 2 billion users over the next 10 years and a $10 trillion market cap, because of the RWA revolution and the unification of the financial markets.” $NIGHT pic.twitter.com/F9mntPZd0I — Angry Crypto Show (@angrycryptoshow) December 28, 2025 Hoskinson says this trend changes everything. When assets move on-chain, crypto stops being just about trading tokens. It becomes financial infrastructure. Add in global payment rails and shared standards across blockchains, and you get what he calls a “unified financial market.” Privacy-focused projects also matter here. Hoskinson has pointed to initiatives like Midnight, which aim to balance compliance and privacy. He believes these tools could make institutions more comfortable bringing large pools of capital on-chain. Cardano’s Reality Check In The Market Still, Hoskinson’s optimism comes at an awkward time for his own network. Cardano (ADA) is ending the year under pressure. Selling has stayed heavy, and rallies haven’t lasted. Buying volume remains thin. Price action is stuck below key resistance levels, and momentum hasn’t flipped. As a result, ADA is hovering near important support zones. If those levels break, traders warn the token could drop below $0.30, a psychological line many are watching closely. Market activity overall has slowed, and for now, sellers are still in control. This disconnect hasn’t gone unnoticed. Critics argue Hoskinson’s push for cooperation is partly driven by Cardano’s struggle to attract users at the pace seen on other major chains. Abundance Of Wealth Hoskinson rejects the idea that crypto is a winner-takes-all game. He says the future isn’t about one chain dominating the rest. Instead, he sees room for many networks to grow together. Related Reading: Crypto Policy In The Hot Seat As US Lawmaker Calls SEC Hearing There’s lots of wealth to spread around, he’s said recently. In his view, projects with real use cases will find users naturally as the market expands. That thinking explains his openness to partnerships. Hoskinson has previously hinted at collaborations involving major ecosystems like XRP and Solana. The goal, he says, is shared growth, not tribal fights. Whether the industry reaches $10 trillion remains an open question. But here’s the thing: If RWAs keep moving on-chain and global finance truly starts to merge with crypto rails, the market Hoskinson imagines won’t sound so far-fetched anymore.

This transaction, reported by blockchain analytics firm Lookonchain on April 10, 2025, represents a notable accumulation in two prominent decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols and offers a compelling data point for market observers seeking to gauge institutional and influential investor sentiment. Arthur Hayes Wallet Accumulates Major DeFi Holdings The reported transaction involved the acquisition of 4.86 million ENA tokens, valued at roughly $986,000, and 697,851 ETHFI tokens, worth approximately $485,000. Consequently, this single action significantly increased the wallet’s exposure to these specific assets. Blockchain analytics platforms like Lookonchain and Nansen track such movements by monitoring on-chain data, linking wallet addresses to public figures through patterns of behavior and known interactions. While absolute certainty in attribution remains a challenge in pseudonymous networks, the consistent pattern and scale of this activity strongly suggest involvement by a sophisticated, well-capitalized entity like Hayes. This purchase follows a broader trend of influential figures in finance making strategic, on-chain investments that become public knowledge. Unlike traditional private equity moves, blockchain transactions provide a transparent, albeit complex, ledger for public analysis. Therefore, transactions from wallets linked to notable individuals often carry disproportionate weight in market narratives, acting as a sentiment indicator for retail and institutional participants alike. Understanding the Tokens: ENA and ETHFI To comprehend the potential significance of this accumulation, one must understand the fundamental projects behind the tokens. Ethena (ENA) is the governance token for the Ethena protocol, which issues a synthetic dollar called USDe. This ‘Internet Bond’ aims to provide a crypto-native, scalable form of money that is decentralized and yield-bearing. The protocol has generated significant discussion regarding its mechanics and sustainability. Conversely, Ether.fi (ETHFI) is the native token of the ether.fi liquid restaking protocol. As a key player in the rapidly growing restaking sector built atop Ethereum, ether.fi allows users to deposit ETH and receive a liquid restaking token (eETH), enabling participation in securing other networks while maintaining liquidity. The following table outlines their core functions: Token Protocol Primary Function ENA Ethena Governance for synthetic dollar (USDe) protocol ETHFI ether.fi Governance and utility for liquid restaking protocol Both tokens represent cutting-edge, yet complex, areas of DeFi innovation—synthetic assets and restaking. An investment of this scale suggests a calculated belief in their underlying technology and market fit. Market Context and Potential Implications The purchase occurs within a specific market environment. Generally, large accumulations by known entities can influence perception, though they do not guarantee price outcomes. Market analysts often scrutinize such moves for several reasons. First, they may indicate insider confidence in the project’s roadmap or upcoming developments. Second, they can signal a broader investment thesis, such as a bullish outlook on specific DeFi verticals like synthetic assets or restaking. Arthur Hayes, as the co-founder of the pioneering crypto derivatives exchange BitMEX, possesses a well-established reputation in the cryptocurrency space. His public commentary on markets and macroeconomics is widely followed. While this on-chain activity is not an official statement, the market frequently interprets it as a data point reflecting his strategic outlook. It is crucial, however, to differentiate between observable on-chain behavior and public endorsement. Several potential impacts stem from this visibility: Sentiment Shift: Increased positive attention from retail investors monitoring ‘smart money’. Liquidity Impact: Large purchases can temporarily reduce available sell-side liquidity on exchanges. Narrative Fuel: Strengthens the narrative around the viability of synthetic dollars and liquid restaking. Nevertheless, investors should consider such activity as one factor among many, including protocol fundamentals, tokenomics, and broader market conditions. Expert Perspective on On-Chain Analytics Blockchain intelligence has become a cornerstone of modern crypto analysis. Firms like Lookonchain, Glassnode, and Arkham Intelligence provide tools that parse transactional data, offering insights into the behavior of whales, exchanges, and funds. This transparency is a double-edged sword; it democratizes information but also requires careful interpretation. A common analytical framework involves tracking wallet inflows and outflows, identifying accumulation or distribution patterns, and correlating them with market events or price action. Regarding this specific event, analysts would typically cross-reference the wallet’s history. Has it made previous purchases of ENA or ETHFI? Does it have a history of well-timed entries or exits? Furthermore, they would examine the sourcing of funds. Was the capital newly bridged from another chain or converted from stablecoins? Each detail adds context to the strategic intent behind the move. This level of forensic analysis underscores the maturation of crypto markets, where data-driven decision-making supplements traditional financial analysis. Conclusion The $1.5 million acquisition of ENA and ETHFI tokens by a wallet linked to Arthur Hayes presents a tangible example of high-profile capital allocation in the DeFi sector. This move highlights continued institutional interest in innovative crypto primitives like synthetic dollars and liquid restaking. For market participants, it serves as a noteworthy case study in on-chain intelligence and the weight of influential investor behavior. Ultimately, while such transactions provide valuable signals, a comprehensive investment strategy must always prioritize fundamental research and risk assessment above singular data points. The Arthur Hayes wallet activity underscores the dynamic and transparent nature of asset accumulation in the blockchain ecosystem. FAQs Q1: How do analysts link a wallet to Arthur Hayes? Analysts use on-chain heuristics, such as tracing funds from known exchange deposits or withdrawals associated with Hayes, observing transaction patterns to and from publicly verified addresses, and corroborating activity with timelines of his public statements or known investments. It is often a probabilistic attribution based on cumulative evidence. Q2: What is the Ethena (ENA) protocol? Ethena is a DeFi protocol built on Ethereum that issues USDe, a synthetic dollar or ‘Internet Bond’. It aims to create a crypto-native, yield-generating stablecoin that is not reliant on traditional banking systems, using a delta-hedging strategy with staked Ethereum and derivatives. Q3: What does Ether.fi (ETHFI) do? Ether.fi is a liquid restaking protocol. Users can deposit their Ethereum (ETH) to help secure other applications (Actively Validated Services) on the network. In return, they receive eETH, a liquid token representing their restaked position, which can be used elsewhere in DeFi while earning additional rewards. Q4: Does this purchase mean Arthur Hayes is publicly endorsing these tokens? Not necessarily. On-chain transactions from a linked wallet indicate an investment action but do not constitute a formal public endorsement or investment advice. It is an observable financial move within a pseudonymous network, which the market interprets based on Hayes’s reputation. Q5: Why is this transaction considered significant news?

In a post on X late Tuesday, EMURGO said the action cleared with “6 out of 7 Constitutional Committee approval and over 85% DRep support,” positioning the proposal to move into its next, more consequential phase. “With the BIA complete, focus now shifts to the Treasury Withdrawal Action,” EMURGO wrote. “This next step transitions the proposal from intent to execution which requires continued active review and support from the CC and DReps.” Why This Is Crucial For Cardano The distinction matters in Cardano’s post-Voltaire governance flow. The Budget Info Action signals alignment around scope and direction, while the Treasury Withdrawal Action is the point at which the ecosystem’s intent is translated into an on-chain withdrawal, meaning governance scrutiny typically intensifies as the discussion moves from principle to disbursement. EMURGO also used the moment to emphasize that the process is already yielding concrete outputs under what it called the “Critical Integrations framework,” describing coordination across the “Pentad” that includes Input Output (IOG), the Cardano Foundation, EMURGO, Intersect, and the Midnight Foundation. Two integrations were highlighted as already confirmed. The first is Pyth Network , which EMURGO described as “real time, institutional-grade market data coming to Cardano,” aimed at supporting DeFi primitives that depend on robust price feeds. EMURGO pointed to use cases including “lending, derivatives, stablecoins, and onchain risk management,” underscoring that oracle availability remains a gating factor for more complex on-chain markets. The second is Dune, which EMURGO said will bring “Cardano data integrated into a shared analytics platform used across the industry,” making on-chain activity “easier to analyze, compare, and build on.” For builders and funds that already rely on common analytics tooling across ecosystems, the pitch is straightforward: lower friction for monitoring Cardano activity alongside other chains, and less bespoke infrastructure work to get dashboards, queries, and reporting into production. EMURGO cast the vote outcome as an indicator of governance maturity and ecosystem alignment, explicitly thanking Constitutional Committee members and DReps for participation “even during the holiday period.” It also framed the timing as a setup for 2026 execution, writing that “this momentum reflects an ecosystem working together with a shared goal” and that Cardano is “positioned to enter 2026 stronger, more capable, and ready to support the next phase of ecosystem growth with these critical integrations in place.” The near-term question now shifts to whether the Treasury Withdrawal Action maintains similar levels of support as the conversation moves from approvals to actual treasury spend, an inflection point that will test not just consensus, but the community’s appetite for follow-through on what “critical integrations” should look like in practice.

According to a comprehensive analysis of blockchain records, the total supply of Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs) surged significantly this year. However, this expansion collided with a sharp contraction in both sales revenue and average prices, painting a complex picture of a maturing yet challenging market. This report, based on verified data from industry tracker CryptoSlam and first covered by Cointelegraph, examines the forces behind these diverging trends and their implications for creators, collectors, and investors in the Web3 space. NFT Market 2025: A Tale of Two Metrics The core data presents a clear paradox. On one hand, the market demonstrated remarkable generative activity. The total number of NFTs circulated across various blockchains reached approximately 1.34 billion units in 2025. This figure represents a substantial 25% increase from the one billion NFTs recorded in circulation during the previous year. This growth indicates sustained developer and creator interest in minting new digital assets across diverse categories like art, gaming, and utility-based tokens. Conversely, the financial metrics tell a different story. Total sales revenue generated from NFT transactions fell sharply to an estimated $5.63 billion. This marks a concerning 37% decline from the $8.9 billion in revenue observed in 2024. Furthermore, the average sale price for an individual NFT dropped from $124 to $96 year-over-year. This combination of rising supply and falling prices and revenue strongly suggests that new asset creation has significantly outpaced organic collector demand. Quantifying the Supply-Demand Imbalance Analysts point to a simple economic principle to explain the trend: oversupply. The market’s capacity to absorb new digital assets has demonstrably weakened. When the rate of new NFT minting exceeds the rate of purchase by new and existing collectors, downward pressure on prices is an inevitable result. This is not merely a short-term fluctuation but a signal of a broader market correction. The total market capitalization for the NFT sector has contracted to around $2.4 billion, a stark contrast to its peak of approximately $17 billion in April 2022 during the previous market cycle’s euphoric phase. Contextualizing the 2025 Digital Asset Landscape To fully understand these figures, one must consider the broader ecosystem. The NFT market does not exist in a vacuum; it is deeply intertwined with the general cryptocurrency market sentiment, technological advancements, and shifting cultural trends. The years following the 2021-2022 boom have been characterized by increased regulatory scrutiny, a focus on tangible utility over speculative hype, and the gradual maturation of blockchain infrastructure. Several key factors likely contributed to the 2025 dynamics: Creator Accessibility: Improved and cheaper minting tools lowered the barrier to entry, enabling more artists and projects to launch collections. Gaming and Metaverse Integration: Many new NFTs were tied to emerging blockchain games and virtual worlds, often distributed in large volumes to users. Shift from Speculation to Utility: The market increasingly rewards NFTs with clear use cases (e.g., event access, software licenses) over purely collectible profile pictures, affecting average price points. Macro-Economic Pressures: Broader financial conditions continued to influence discretionary spending on digital collectibles. Historical Perspective and Market Evolution The current data reflects a natural evolution for a novel asset class. Similar patterns of explosive growth followed by consolidation and valuation reassessment have occurred in other technological sectors. The decline from the 2022 peak capitalization indicates a market shedding speculative excess. The current focus is shifting toward sustainable models, intellectual property development, and integrating NFTs into broader digital experiences rather than standalone speculative instruments. This maturation phase, while challenging for short-term traders, may establish a healthier foundation for long-term growth based on real usage and community engagement. Impacts on Creators, Collectors, and Platforms The diverging trends of supply and revenue have direct consequences for all market participants. For creators and artists, the environment has become more competitive. Standing out in a sea of 1.34 billion assets requires stronger branding, community building, and innovative utility. Simply minting a collection is no longer a guarantee of financial success. For collectors, the market offers more choice but requires greater diligence. The falling average price can present buying opportunities but also increases the risk of investing in assets that may not retain value. For marketplaces and platforms, the pressure is on to enhance discovery tools, improve user experience, and provide deeper analytics to help users navigate the vast inventory. The business models reliant primarily on trading volume fees face headwinds when overall revenue declines. Consequently, many platforms are expanding into value-added services like analytics, portfolio management, and curated experiences to drive engagement beyond simple transactions. Conclusion The 2025 NFT market analysis reveals a sector in a critical phase of rebalancing. The significant 25% growth in NFT supply against a 37% drop in sales revenue underscores a fundamental shift from scarcity-driven speculation to a market governed by utility, demand, and sustainable economics. While the contraction in total market capitalization from its 2022 peak may seem negative, it likely represents a necessary correction, filtering out low-quality assets and focusing attention on projects with enduring value. The path forward for the NFT market 2025 and beyond will depend on innovation that bridges the gap between abundant creation and genuine, valuable demand. FAQs Q1: What does “NFT supply grew” actually mean? It refers to the total number of unique Non-Fungible Tokens minted and existing on blockchains. The 1.34 billion figure represents all individual NFT assets in circulation, not the number of collections or transactions. Q2: Does falling revenue mean the NFT market is dying? Not necessarily. It indicates a market correction and maturation. Revenue decline paired with supply growth often signals a shift from speculative frenzy to a more normalized, utility-focused market, which can be healthier for long-term development. Q3: Where does the data for this analysis come from? The primary data is sourced from CryptoSlam, a leading blockchain data aggregator that tracks NFT sales and volumes across multiple chains. This analysis was contextualized following initial reporting by Cointelegraph. Q4: How does the average sale price drop affect existing NFT holders? It can decrease the paper value of existing holdings, particularly for assets in oversupplied or low-demand categories. However, unique, high-quality, or utility-rich assets from established communities may demonstrate more price resilience. Q5: What is the significance of the market capitalization dropping to $2.4 billion? Market cap is an estimate of the total value of the NFT sector. The drop from the $17 billion peak shows a massive devaluation of the asset class post-bubble, reflecting both lower prices and a market reassessment of the fundamental value of many digital collectibles.

While Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) remain industry benchmarks, early-stage opportunities often deliver the highest growth windows. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is positioning itself as a crypto to buy now by entering the market with real financial infrastructure during its presale phase 7, where upside is driven by adoption rather than speculation. As crypto investing shifts toward platforms with working models and long-term demand, MUTM is gaining attention as a frontrunner in the next growth cycle. Bitcoin (BTC): Stability Without Exponential Upside Bitcoin (BTC) remains the foundation of the crypto market, valued for its security and store-of-value narrative. However, its size limits exponential growth. BTC’s role in crypto investing is now centered on preservation rather than aggressive expansion. Compared to early-stage platforms like Mutuum Finance (MUTM), Bitcoin (BTC)’s growth curve reflects maturity, not rapid upside. Ethereum (ETH): Strong Infrastructure, Slower Multipliers Ethereum (ETH) continues to dominate smart contracts and decentralized applications, but its growth is increasingly tied to network upgrades and market cycles. While ETH offers strong utility, its large market capitalization makes 20x growth far less realistic. In contrast, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) enters the market with a lower valuation and a focused use case designed to scale with adoption. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Presale and Unique Dual Lending Models Right after the spotlight turns to growth, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) stands out for its current presale metrics. The total supply is capped at 4 billion tokens. Across all presale phases combined, around $19.55 million has already been generated, showing steady interest from early participants. The current price sits at $0.040, with over 18,600 holders already involved across all phases of the presale. In phase 7, 5% of the 180 million token allocation has already been sold. A major usability update has also been introduced, allowing users to purchase MUTM tokens directly with a card and no purchase limits, removing a key barrier for new investors entering crypto investing. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is being built as a decentralized lending and borrowing platform designed in simple terms: users will earn from lending and gain liquidity without selling assets. The protocol will operate through two clear models. The first is Peer-to-Contract, where liquidity pools will allow users to lend and borrow in a structured and automated way. The second is Peer-to-Peer, which will handle higher-risk assets separately to protect the core system. In the P2C model, lenders will pool assets such as stablecoins like DAI, and other major cryptocurrencies including BTC into audited smart contracts. Borrowers will access this liquidity by providing overcollateralized collateral. Interest rates will dynamically adjust based on pool usage. As utilization increases, rates rise, encouraging more deposits while discouraging excessive borrowing. This feedback loop will help maintain solvency while improving capital efficiency. The P2P model will serve riskier or less liquid tokens such as PEPE, and DOGE. In this structure, lenders and borrowers will negotiate terms directly, including interest rates and loan duration. There will be no shared pool, meaning lenders take on more risk but gain access to higher returns. This separation will protect the core liquidity pools while expanding earning opportunities across the ecosystem. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) will also introduce a stable interest rate option for certain assets. Stable rates will be calculated at the time of borrowing and typically start higher than variable rates, offering predictable repayment costs. Rebalancing mechanisms will protect liquidity if market conditions shift sharply. Only suitable assets will qualify, ensuring the protocol remains resilient. All loans on the platform will require overcollateralization. A Stability Factor will continuously assess collateral health, and automated liquidations will occur if thresholds are breached. Liquidators will repurchase debt at a discount, keeping the system secure and protecting other users. How 20x Is Possible for MUTM Mutuum Finance (MUTM) announced via its official X account that the V1 of its protocol is expected to go live on the Sepolia Testnet soon. This initial rollout will bring the platform’s core infrastructure online, including the liquidity pool, mtToken and debt token systems, and an automated liquidator bot designed to protect collateral and maintain operational stability. Users will be able to lend, borrow, and use ETH or USDT as collateral during this stage. Launching V1 on the testnet allows the community to gain early hands-on experience with the protocol before the mainnet deployment. This phased approach enhances transparency, encourages early participation, and provides the development team with valuable feedback for refinement. As engagement grows and more users explore the testnet, confidence in the ecosystem is expected to strengthen, supporting sustained demand for the MUTM token. Beyond lending, MUTM’s value will be tied directly to platform activity. Every feature, including lending, borrowing, staking, and buybacks, will drive transactional demand. The roadmap also includes an overcollateralized stablecoin system that will allow users to mint a decentralized $1-pegged asset using approved collateral such as ETH, SOL, or AVAX. Each minting and repayment action will increase on-chain activity and deepen MUTM’s role across the ecosystem. Security and long-term utility are central to Mutuum Finance (MUTM). The team announced an independent audit by Halborn Security which was recently completed, ensuring that lending and borrowing contracts are thoroughly tested for vulnerabilities. This audit process strengthens trust and confirms that the platform is being built on professionally validated smart contracts eventually attracting investors and rising MUTMs demand. $100K Giveaways and $500 Rewards Alongside this technical development, community engagement is already active. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has grown to over 12,000 followers on Twitter and is running an ongoing $100K giveaway , where ten winners each receive $10,000 worth of MUTM tokens. The platform dashboard is already live, enabling users to view holdings and calculate projected returns. The Top 50 leaderboard rewards the largest participants with bonus MUTM tokens, and a new daily bonus feature now grants $500 in MUTM to the top-ranked user every 24 hours, provided at least one transaction is made within that timeframe. The leaderboard resets daily at 00:00 UTC, keeping engagement consistent.

The clip features Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse speaking about regulation, institutional partnerships, and XRP. Rather than focusing on short-term price action, the comments suggest a longer arc for XRP, one tied to scale, compliance, and utility within existing financial rails. Rietveld’s post comes as investors debate whether XRP’s performance reflects speculation or structure. The video leans strongly toward the latter. Garlinghouse speaks plainly about Ripple’s strategy since inception and why that strategy differentiates XRP from many other digital assets . Brad Garlinghouse Makes Bold $XRP Statement!! pic.twitter.com/AFqj8jrcsH — Levi | Crypto Crusaders (@LeviRietveld) December 29, 2025 Working Inside the System Garlinghouse said Ripple has worked with regulators “from the get-go.” He added that the company has partnered with regulated institutions, such as banks , “where there isn’t regulatory uncertainty.” Those statements show Ripple’s long-standing approach. While much of the crypto sector pursued disruption without coordination, Ripple focused on compliance and integration. That strategy, he said, has helped build confidence in XRP among market participants who value clarity, compliance, and institutional alignment. Ripple works with the system rather than against it. The CEO did not position XRP as a replacement for existing finance. He described it as infrastructure. That places XRP within global payment flows rather than outside them. Scale, Trillions, and Value Creation Garlinghouse addressed a common comparison. He asked whether XRP is the next Bitcoin . His answer focuses on problem-solving, rather than narrative. He said that if Ripple can solve this challenge at scale, then it addresses “a problem measured in the trillions of dollars.” That line anchors the value thesis. Cross-border payments remain slow and expensive. Banks and institutions still rely on outdated systems built decades ago. Ripple targets that inefficiency. XRP serves as the liquidity layer that enables capital to move without pre-funded accounts. Garlinghouse concluded that under those conditions, “there’s a lot of opportunity to create value in XRP.” The emphasis remains on utility and adoption.

Continued bank adoption, payment corridor expansion, and liquidity growth on the XRP Ledger would strengthen the value case Garlinghouse described. Rietveld’s video highlights that Ripple’s goals have not changed. XRP’s future depends on scale, regulation, and real-world settlement. That approach may move more slowly than speculation, but it’ll last much longer. Disclaimer : This content is meant to inform and should not be considered financial advice.

This regulatory examination focuses on adjusting tick sizes for Bitcoin ETF options, specifically targeting the Mini Bitcoin U.S. ETF Index options. Market participants now await a decision that could significantly influence cryptocurrency derivatives trading efficiency. Bitcoin ETF Options Tick Size Proposal Enters SEC Review Phase CBOE formally submitted its proposal to the SEC in late September 2024. The exchange seeks to modify minimum price increments for MBTX options. According to the filing, options priced below $3 would move in $0.01 increments. Meanwhile, options at $3 or above would use $0.05 increments. This adjustment represents a technical but crucial market structure change. Currently, many options contracts use wider tick sizes that can affect trading precision. The proposed changes aim to enhance market liquidity and price discovery. Furthermore, they would align CBOE’s Bitcoin ETF options with existing spot Bitcoin ETF standards. This alignment creates consistency across related financial products. Understanding Tick Size Mechanics and Market Impact Tick size refers to the minimum price movement allowed for a security. In options trading, this determines how finely prices can adjust. Smaller tick sizes generally benefit retail investors through tighter bid-ask spreads. However, they can also increase market complexity and data volume. The proposed changes specifically affect MBTX options. These options derive their value from an index tracking multiple spot Bitcoin ETFs. Consequently, their pricing should logically align with underlying ETF characteristics. CBOE’s argument centers on this logical consistency requirement. Current Structure: MBTX options use standard equity option tick sizes Proposed Structure: $0.01 for options under $3, $0.05 for $3+ options Comparison Point: BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) uses $0.01 increments Market Effect: Potentially tighter spreads and improved execution Regulatory Precedents and Historical Context The SEC maintains a consistent approach to market structure changes. Historically, the commission evaluates tick size proposals against several criteria. These include market quality metrics, investor protection considerations, and systemic risk assessments. Previous tick size modifications for other products required extensive analysis periods. In 2016, the SEC implemented the Tick Size Pilot Program for small-cap stocks. That program tested wider tick sizes to improve market quality. Results showed mixed outcomes across different metrics. Now, the commission faces a similar evaluation for cryptocurrency-linked derivatives. Cryptocurrency ETF options represent a relatively new asset class. Their regulatory treatment continues evolving alongside market development. The SEC’s review will likely consider both traditional options market principles and cryptocurrency-specific factors. Industry Implications and Expert Perspectives Market analysts generally view the proposal as a positive development. Finer tick sizes typically reduce trading costs for participants. They also enable more precise price discovery mechanisms. However, some experts caution about potential unintended consequences. “Tick size reductions often improve market quality metrics,” notes derivatives analyst Michael Chen. “But they can also increase message traffic and system loads. Exchanges must balance efficiency gains with operational stability.” The proposal’s timing coincides with growing Bitcoin ETF trading volumes. Spot Bitcoin ETFs now manage billions in assets under management. Their options markets naturally develop alongside this growth. Regulatory alignment between spot and derivatives markets becomes increasingly important. Comparative Analysis: Bitcoin ETF Options vs. Traditional Equity Options Feature Bitcoin ETF Options (Proposed) Traditional Equity Options Tick Size Under $3 $0.01 $0.05 Tick Size $3+ $0.05 $0.05 or $0.10 Underlying Asset Bitcoin ETF Index Individual Stocks/ETFs Regulatory Framework SEC & CFTC Considerations Primarily SEC Trading Hours Standard Options Hours Standard Options Hours Potential Market Effects and Trading Considerations Approval could significantly affect Bitcoin ETF options trading dynamics. Retail investors might benefit most from reduced spreads. Market makers would adjust quoting strategies accordingly. Trading algorithms would require updates to accommodate new increment rules. Liquidity providers typically welcome finer pricing granularity. It allows more precise risk management and hedging. However, smaller tick sizes can compress market maker profits per trade. This compression might affect liquidity during volatile periods. The proposal specifically references alignment with IBIT’s tick structure. BlackRock’s spot Bitcoin ETF uses $0.01 pricing increments. This creates a logical connection between spot and derivatives markets. Such alignment reduces arbitrage complexities between related products. Regulatory Timeline and Decision Expectations SEC reviews of exchange rule proposals follow established timelines. The commission typically publishes proposals for public comment first. Then, it analyzes feedback before making final determinations. This process usually takes 45 to 90 days for non-controversial changes. Given cryptocurrency’s regulatory sensitivity, the review might extend longer. Commissioners may request additional data or analysis. The proposal’s technical nature could expedite the process though. Market participants expect a decision by early 2025 at the latest. Previous cryptocurrency-related proposals faced extended scrutiny. However, tick size adjustments represent operational rather than policy decisions. This distinction might facilitate smoother regulatory approval. Conclusion The SEC’s review of CBOE’s Bitcoin ETF options tick size proposal marks another step in cryptocurrency market maturation. This technical adjustment promises enhanced trading efficiency and market alignment. Regulatory approval would demonstrate continued integration of digital assets into traditional financial frameworks. Market participants now monitor the review process for signals about broader regulatory approaches to cryptocurrency derivatives. FAQs Q1: What exactly is a tick size in options trading? A tick size represents the minimum price increment a security can move. It determines how finely prices can adjust during trading sessions. Q2: Why does CBOE want to change Bitcoin ETF option tick sizes? CBOE seeks alignment with spot Bitcoin ETF tick sizes. This creates consistency between related products and potentially improves market efficiency. Q3: How might smaller tick sizes affect retail investors? Smaller tick sizes typically reduce bid-ask spreads. This reduction lowers trading costs for retail participants executing smaller orders. Q4: What is the MBTX index that these options track? The Mini Bitcoin U.S. ETF Index tracks multiple spot Bitcoin ETFs. It provides diversified exposure to the Bitcoin ETF market through a single instrument. Q5: When might the SEC make a final decision on this proposal? The SEC typically decides within 45-90 days for standard proposals. Given the cryptocurrency context, a decision could come by early 2025.
