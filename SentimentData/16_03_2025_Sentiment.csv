Speaking on Friday, Vance acknowledged that while the job cuts were a key part of Trump’s plan to slash government spending, not every decision was handled correctly. “Elon himself has said that sometimes you do something, you make a mistake, and then you undo the mistake. I’m accepting of mistakes,” Vance said in an interview with NBC News. He emphasized that errors must be corrected quickly and noted that not all federal employees deserve to be fired. “There are a lot of good people who work in the government—a lot of people who are doing a very good job,” he said. “We want to try to preserve as much of what works in government as possible while eliminating what doesn’t work.” Musk’s mass firings cause legal and political battles For the past seven weeks, Musk has led an aggressive push to cut thousands of federal jobs, implementing Trump’s plan to overhaul the government. The mass layoffs have triggered lawsuits, resistance from judges, and outrage from workers who suddenly found themselves unemployed. Musk, who has been overseeing the effort, has repeatedly dismissed government employees as “fraudsters” who aren’t doing their jobs. Republican vice presidential nominee Sen. JD Vance, R-Ohio, speaks during a vice presidential debate hosted by CBS News, Tuesday, Oct. 1, 2024, in New York. AP Photo/Matt Rourke – ABC7 Vance distanced himself from those sweeping accusations. “I think some people clearly are collecting a check and not doing a job,” he said . “Now, how many people is that? I don’t know, in a 3 million-strong federal workforce, whether it’s a few thousand or much larger than that.” Despite supporting the firings, Vance made it clear that not everyone deserved to lose their job. “However big the problem is, it is a problem when people are living off the generosity of the American taxpayer in a civil service job and not doing the people’s business,” he said. But he also defended those who actually show up and do their work. “You do have a lot of great civil servants who are doing important work,” he said. “I think most of those great civil servants would say we want to be empowered to do our job. We don’t want the person who doesn’t show up five days a week to make it harder for us to do what we need to do.” Vance faces public backlash and protests While Vance toured a plastics factory in Bay City, Michigan, his arrival was met with middle fingers and vulgar signs from protesters. Some held up signs with messages like “Go home, scumbag” as his motorcade passed through. The night before, he was booed at the Kennedy Center in Washington. Even in his own neighborhood in Ohio, he was confronted by pro-Ukraine demonstrators while walking with his 3-year-old daughter. “The thing at the Kennedy Center I thought was funny,” Vance said. “The thing by my house I thought was kind of annoying. I think you just kind of take the good with the bad.” Inside the factory, Vance was welcomed by a pro-Trump crowd filled with local Republicans. He spoke about Trump’s plans to rebuild American manufacturing and boost the economy. But he also warned that the process wouldn’t be immediate. “Now I have to be honest with you,” Vance said. “The road ahead of us is long, but we are already, in just seven short weeks, starting to see early indications of the president’s vision becoming our shared American reality.” Recent polls paint a different picture. A CNN poll showed that 56% of adults disapprove of how Trump is handling the economy. A Quinnipiac University poll found that 54% of registered voters share that disapproval. At the same time, Trump’s push for tariffs on foreign goods has sparked fears of a trade war that could drive up prices for consumers. Foreign policy fights and future ambitions Vance has played a major role in shaping Trump’s foreign policy, delivering a fiery speech last month at the Munich Security Conference where he criticized European leaders over free speech and mass migration. In the Oval Office, he clashed with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, accusing him of being ungrateful for U.S. financial and military aid. “I just try not to be overly scripted,” Vance said. “The classic thing to do in Munich would have been to show up and give a speech about NATO or give a speech about where the Ukraine-Russia thing was at that moment in time, and just sort of thought to myself, like, ‘What is it that I think is really important to say?’” Meanwhile, Trump stirred speculation about Vance’s political future. In a recent Fox News interview, Trump said it was “too early” to talk about Vance as a possible successor in 2028. Asked if he had plans to run for president, Vance dismissed the idea, saying his only focus is doing his job now. “Wow, I’m the vice president-elect of the United States,” Vance recalled thinking on Election Night. “And, you know, if I never go further in politics, I’m totally fine with that, but we get a really good opportunity to do a lot of really good s— the next four years.” But he didn’t rule anything out. “If I do really well for the next four years, everything else will take care of itself,” Vance said.

Some experts think DOGE could hit as high as $50 if asset manager BlackRock files for a DOGE ETF this year. This projection is not unexpected, considering the firm’s precedence in the crypto industry. DOGE Price Catalysts to Watch Dogecoin is facing intense selloff pressure in the crypto market at the moment. Notably, the Elon Musk-led Department of Government Efficiency (D.O.G.E) that was supposed to fuel a DOGE price rally has not achieved this. This has created new conversation points for a potential Dogecoin price trigger. With limited smart contract functionalities, analysts believe the prospect of a Dogecoin ETF can revive DOGE’s price outlook in the mid to long term. As a memecoin, the token has seen intense fluctuations in the past few weeks, down 45.66% in the year-to-date period per data from CoinMarketCap. While the $1 price target feels elusive, more ambitious targets are on the horizon should top asset managers like BlackRock push for direct support of the coin. How Soon Can a Dogecoin ETF Launch Notably, BlackRock already dominates the spot Bitcoin and Ethereum ETF markets. To reiterate its dominance, there is a new Bitcoin ETF allocation to the BlackRock $150 billion model portfolio. With this, proponents believe the asset manager could replicate this strong adoption for a DOGE ETF. Grayscale Investments has already launched its Dogecoin Trust for institutional investors. Many see this move as a step towards the future asset manager filing for a DOGE ETF. Grayscale said the fund is opened for daily subscription to eligible individual and institutional accredited investors. As CoinGape reported earlier, the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has formally acknowledged Grayscale’s spot ETF application for Dogecoin. This acknowledgment departs from the SEC’s historically rigid stance on altcoin ETFs. Bloomberg analysts James Seyffart and Eric Balchunas estimate a 75% chance of a Dogecoin ETF approval. Their prediction quickly sparked excitement about DOGE’s possible price movements. Current Dogecoin Price Projection DOGE price hit a daily high of $0.175 on Friday, following a broader market uptick. Dogecoin is traded at $0.1741, demonstrating a 2.8% increase in the last 24 hours. However, the daily trading volume has decreased by 13.6% to $1.02 billion, suggesting a reduction in investor activity. Still, market participants are projecting an optimistic outlook for the memecoin. Doge Lord, a Dogecoin enthusiast, forecasted the memecoin could rise to $1 during this cycle. Others have forecasted that the Dogecoin price could hit $50 in the long term on the heels of a DOGE filing from BlackRock. While this appears economically impossible, the BlackRock influence might fuel a significant DOGE price rally. Per the current outlook, the possibility of BlackRock filing an XRP ETF application, let alone DOGE ETF this year is very slim. The asset manager has not filed any other ETFs besides BTC and ETH. The asset manager is likely cautious about altcoin ETFs, which were previously under fire from the SEC. However, with the SEC now under a new pro-crypto administration, BlackRock may change its stance on altcoin ETFs. This could eventually lead to DOGE ETF acceptance.

XRP Overtakes Ethereum In Terms of FDV According to Token Terminal, XRP's FDV has exceeded $240 billion. Ethereum's figure is $231.5 billion. However, the Ripple project cryptocurrency is still inferior to ETH in terms of capitalization. The market value of XRP is $140 billion, while Ethereum is about $231 billion. Nevertheless, XRP's rapid growth indicates a significant change in market dynamics. The price of ETH has been falling steadily in recent months. This has been affected by management problems at the Ethereum Foundation, as well as the not-so-successful implementation of the Pectra update. Earlier in the hardfork rollout, there were several failures in the Sepolia and Holesky test networks. Initially, Pectra's introduction into the mainstream was scheduled for late March. However, the developers recently pushed that date back to April. XRP Successes Meanwhile, XRP is experiencing a sharp rise. This is due to greater clarity in the regulation of the crypto industry in the US, as well as support from institutionalizers. Since Donald Trump's re-election, the asset's price has risen more than 300%, peaking at $3.38 in January. Recently, the American president mentioned XRP among the key assets to be included in the US cryptocurrency reserve. This has further boosted investor confidence in this coin. The XRP Ledger (XPRL) blockchain, which has been adopted by financial institutions such as Societe Generale, has also gained widespread adoption. Large asset managers are increasingly applying to launch spot exchange-traded funds (ETFs) based on the Ripple cryptocurrency. Now the crypto community is discussing rumors that BlackRock may soon take this step. ”BlackRock will file ETFs for Solana and XRP. An announcement regarding Solana could come any day now. And regarding XRP, most likely after the conflict with the SEC is over,” predicted Nate Geraci, president of ETF Store. It was reported earlier that the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) plans to close its case against Ripple. There is a possibility that XRP may be recognized as a commodity rather than a security. Such events will have an extremely positive impact on the market dynamics of the asset.",News|Ripple,EN,0,0,XRP|ETH|MARKET|REGULATION|BUSINESS,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-03-15 20:43:14

The shift in liquidity suggests traders are favoring platform-native assets for their utility and stability in uncertain macroeconomic conditions. Exchange Tokens Standout as Crypto markets recover Crypto markets saw a mild recovery of 0.13% on Friday, signaling that recent gains in top-performing assets are largely driven by traders rotating funds across different sectors rather than fresh capital inflows. This reflects a cautious sentiment among investors as global macroeconomic uncertainties—particularly escalating trade war tensions—overshadow easing U.S. inflation data published earlier this week. With broader market sentiment still leaning bearish, traders are reallocating capital between different crypto sectors, either to capitalize on niche media narratives or to exploit arbitrage opportunities. This shift has inadvertently boosted demand within the exchange token sector, led by Binance Coin ( BNB ), OKX (OKB), and Bitget (BGB). According to Coingecko, the Exchange-based tokens’ aggregate valuation grew by $1.9 billion in the last 24 hours, reaching the $122 billion mark at the time of writing. Exchange tokens sector performance, March 14 | Source: Coingecko BNB currently trades at $578.51, posting 0.2% gains intraday, while OKB has climbed to $45.05, reflecting a 7.5% increase in 24 hours. Meanwhile, Bitget’s BGB token trading at $4.18 has also surged 3.7% over the same period. Crypto Market Outlook: Altcoins to Watch ahead of US Fed Rate Decision Exchange token sector outperforming the broader market, affirms the narrative that crypto traders are moving liquidity into exchange-native assets. These tokens typically offer fee discounts, staking rewards, and governance benefits—enhancing their attractiveness in high-volatility market phases as observed this week. If this dynamic persists, BNB, OKB, and BGB could see further upside, particularly if volatility drives more trading activity. However, strategic traders may be unwilling to deploy large leverage positions to drive aggressive rallies. Without fresh bullish catalysts, buyer fatigue could set in, leading to potential liquidations across the board.” BNB Price Forecast: Breakout Momentum Builds as Bulls Target $650 Resistance BNB price has surged 21.6% over the past four days, reclaiming key technical levels as bullish momentum strengthens. The price has decisively broken above the middle Bollinger Band (20-day moving average), currently at $590, signaling a shift in market structure. The upper Bollinger Band at $637 now serves as the next resistance, and a successful breakout could drive BNB toward the $650 level. BNB Price Outlook The MACD histogram has flipped green for the first time in nearly three weeks, confirming a bullish crossover as the MACD line trends above the signal line. This momentum shift suggests increasing buying pressure, reinforcing the probability of continued upside. The recent price expansion has also been accompanied by rising volume, with the last four daily candles showing higher trading activity—typically a strong indicator of trend continuation. However, if resistance at $637 proves too strong, a rejection could lead to a retest of the $590 support level. A failure to hold above this range would expose BNB to a potential pullback toward the lower Bollinger Band at $542. Despite this risk, the overall market structure remains bullish, and a sustained close above $637 could trigger a fresh rally targeting $680 and beyond. Bitget (BGB) Price Forecast: Bulls Could Consolidate above $6 as if Market Demand Persists BGB price is showing signs of stabilization after a multi-week pullback, with buyers stepping in to defend key support levels. Despite recent bearish pressure, the price remains well above the 50-week and 200-week moving averages, signaling the broader uptrend is intact. The Parabolic SAR dots remain positioned above the price, indicating the ongoing correction phase, but a shift below could confirm a bullish reversal. Bitget (BGB) Price Forecast Currently trading at $4.455, BGB finds itself in a crucial zone where demand is beginning to resurface. The Bollinger Band Percentile (BBP) indicator has dipped into negative territory, reflecting the recent selling pressure, but this often signals an oversold condition that could pave the way for a recovery. If bulls can reclaim momentum, a breakout above $5 would open the door for a rally toward $6, aligning with prior resistance and the upper SAR targets. Conversely, failure to sustain the current level may lead to further downside risk. A break below $4 would expose lower supports, with the next major cushion near $3 OKB Price Forecast: Bulls Targeting $50 Retest OKB price is showing strong bullish momentum, rebounding sharply from its recent lows with a decisive green candle. The breakout above prior resistance suggests growing buying pressure, confirmed by the positive shift in the BBP (Bollinger Band Percentile) indicator, which has flipped green for the first time in weeks. This shift signals increasing bullish momentum after a prolonged downtrend. OKB Price Forecast The price is currently trading at $46.60, with the next significant resistance levels at the 50-day and 200-day moving averages, sitting at $47.95 and $49.78, respectively. A successful break above these levels could fuel a rally toward the psychological $50 mark and beyond. Additionally, the Parabolic SAR dots have shifted below the price action, indicating a trend reversal and reinforcing the bullish outlook. However, failure to maintain momentum could see OKB price face resistance at these key moving averages, potentially leading to a rejection and pullback. A break back below $44 would invalidate the bullish setup, with the next downside support resting near $38.48.

The goal? Reshaping the U.S. economy and forcing other nations to negotiate on his terms. But while some American businesses are thriving, others are drowning under skyrocketing costs. The biggest winners right now are U.S. steel and aluminum manufacturers. Trump slapped a 25% tariff on imported steel and aluminum, instantly making domestic production more competitive. U.S. Steel and Cleveland-Cliffs are now in high demand, and Century Aluminum, the nation’s largest primary aluminum producer, says these tariffs will drive a “resurgence” in American aluminum production. The results are clear: hot-rolled steel prices jumped to $945 per ton, the highest since February 2024, and aluminum prices surged 45 cents per pound, passing $990 per metric ton in a single day. Companies cashing in on Trump’s trade war Anheuser-Busch, the company behind Bud Light and Michelob, is one of the biggest winners. The company doesn’t have to worry about import tariffs because 99% of its beer is brewed in the U.S. and 99% of its ingredients come from American farmers. That insulation from global trade wars has helped Anheuser-Busch’s stock jump 24% this year while competitors struggle with rising costs. Another group raking in profits? Warehouse owners. American companies are stockpiling raw materials and goods, preparing for even worse tariffs. All of that extra inventory needs storage, driving up demand for warehouse space. The gold and silver markets are also thriving. Investors see precious metals as a safe bet during economic uncertainty, and that’s exactly what’s happening now. Since the start of the year, gold prices have soared 13% to over $3,000 per ounce, while silver has climbed 14% to $34 per ounce. XAUUSD 1-hour price chart. Source/TradingView Then there’s the tech sector—at least, the software and AI side of it. Palantir, Oracle, Microsoft, and Salesforce are dodging the worst of the trade war because they don’t rely on Chinese factories. Wedbush analyst Dan Ives said Palantir is in a particularly strong position, thanks to its U.S. government contracts and AI technology investments. Industries getting crushed by tariffs The stock market is bleeding. The Nasdaq has lost 2,300 points in just 30 days, a 12% drop, and the S&P 500 has crashed more than 10% from its recent highs. Investors are dumping tech stocks that depend on Chinese supply chains. No company is feeling it worse than Apple. Trump hit Chinese imports with a 20% tariff, and Apple relies on China for manufacturing. The company’s stock is down 13% since January, and analysts say moving production back to the U.S. would take at least five years and cost over $20 billion. The automakers aren’t doing much better. Ford, GM, and Tesla are scrambling as raw material costs surge. Barclays analysts estimate that Trump’s tariffs will add $400 to the cost of every car built in the U.S. That’s not good news for Tesla, which has already seen its stock plunge 36% this year. The alcohol industry is taking massive losses. Trump just announced a 200% tariff on European wine and champagne, responding to the EU’s 50% tariff on American whiskey. Retailers are scrambling to stockpile bottles, knowing prices will soon skyrocket. A $109 bottle of Chateau Rauzan Segla Margaux will cost $375 once the new tariffs kick in. It’s not just luxury goods suffering. California’s almond industry is in trouble. One-third of California’s almonds are shipped to Europe, and now they’re facing retaliatory tariffs. Farmers are bracing for major revenue losses, and industry experts say it could take years to recover. Retaliation from other countries Other nations aren’t backing down. Canada just hit back with $21 billion in retaliatory tariffs, slamming American farm products, whiskey, and other goods. Some Canadian retailers have even pulled Tennessee whiskey from their shelves entirely, refusing to sell American-made liquor in protest of Trump’s trade war. Mexico and China are also pushing back. China’s 20% tariff on American imports is a direct response to Trump’s policies, and it’s putting serious pressure on Tesla, Apple, and automakers. One company pleading for help is Tesla. In a letter to the U.S. Trade Representative’s office, Tesla warned that it faces “disproportionate impacts” from retaliatory tariffs. The electric vehicle company is already struggling with supply chain issues, and now it’s being hit from multiple directions. The stock market is reacting badly. The Dow Jones just dropped 1,000 points in the last 30 days, marking a 2.4% decline. Investors are on edge, but the Trump administration isn’t worried. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent shrugged off concerns, saying , “We’re focused on the real economy. I’m not concerned about a little bit of volatility over three weeks.” Cryptopolitan Academy: Want to grow your money in 2025? Learn how to do it with DeFi in our upcoming webclass.

The crypto exchange filed Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) requests to uncover details about U.S. regulator’s actions against crypto companies. Coinbase alleged that the Federal Deposit Insurance Commission (FDIC) and the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) have responded slowly. The trading platform said the agencies are either holding back key details or releasing documents with many important details left out. Coinbase is frustrated by the lack of clarity as it intensifies its fight to expose what it sees as unfair targeting of the crypto industry. Coinbase Fights Against Operation Chokepoint 2.0 The crypto exchange filed a Freedom of Information Act request to obtain documents from the Federal Deposit Insurance Commission. The documents were supposed to shed light on the agency’s involvement in Operation Chokepoint 2.0. This operation is an alleged effort by regulators to restrict crypto companies from accessing banking services. However, when the FDIC finally responded, Coinbase was not satisfied. In a recent X post , Coinbase’s Chief Legal Officer, Paul Grewal, accused the FDIC of being slow and unhelpful. He believes the agency is deliberately withholding key details about its actions. Coinbase wants to see proof that the FDIC properly documented its role in banking restrictions against crypto companies. However, the agency has not provided clear answers so far. Although the FDIC has promised to search for more records, Coinbase is not convinced it will get the full truth. The Demand for SEC’s Legal Spending Records The FDIC is not the only regulator Coinbase is challenging. The company has also filed a FOIA request against the SEC. This time, Coinbase wants to know how much money the agency has spent on legal battles against crypto companies. For years, the SEC has aggressively targeted crypto firms with lawsuits, but many of these cases have ended in dismissal. Recently, the SEC dropped its case against Kraken and OpenSea. The agency’s legal actions against Coinbase were widely criticized, but they eventually ended. The crypto firm believes that the SEC wasted public resources by going after crypto businesses instead of providing clear rules for the industry. The exchange is especially concerned about the costs of these legal actions. The SEC often hires expensive third-party contractors to assist in its cases, which likely increases the financial burden on taxpayers. Coinbase Calls for Transparency in Crypto Regulation Coinbase’s fight with regulators shows the ongoing problem between the crypto industry and the U.S. government. Under the previous administration, regulators made it harder for crypto businesses instead of giving them clear rules to follow. The exchange wants the FDIC and SEC to be open about their actions, calling for transparency. Coinbase is determined to uncover the truth and the result could change the future of the crypto industry.

The issuer is eyeing March 28 as a tentative date for the liquidation of both ETFs amid a wave of new filings in the US. 21Shares Set To Liquidate Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs According to an announcement, crypto ETF issuer 21Shares has disclosed plans to ditch its Bitcoin and Ethereum futures ETFs. Per the announcement, the affected ETFs are the ARK 21Shares Active Bitcoin Ethereum Strategy ETF and the ARK 21Shares Active On-Chain Bitcoin Strategy ETF. While the press release did not give clear reasons for the liquidations, it hinged its decision on a periodic review of its offerings. The statement cited a need to align existing product lineups with market dynamics and clients’ needs in a changing landscape. However, pundits say the liquidations are a result of jarring ETF outflows in recent months. Shareholders can sell their holdings up until March 27, a date touted as the last trading day for both ETFs. 21Shares plans to put the final nail in the coffin for both ETFs on March 28, liquidating all remaining assets. “Shareholders who continue to hold shares of a Fund on the Fund’s Liquidation Date will receive a liquidating distribution with a value equal to their proportionate ownership interest in the Fund,” read the press release. Increased ETF Activity In The Cryptoverse Despite the wave of outflows, the ETF space is sizzling with frenetic activity. Buoyed by impressive returns, 21Shares slashed fees to 0.49% for its Bitcoin Ethereum Core ETPs. Bitwise has rolled out its OWNB ETF to track companies holding Bitcoin on their balance sheets. Bitcoin ETF investors continue to put their faith in offerings in the face of price amid Rex Shares launching the first Bitcoin Corporate Bond Convertible ETF Outside of Bitcoin, several issuers have filed for XRP, HBAR, DOGE, and AVAX ETFs with the US SEC.

AAVE was one of those golden opportunities—ignored by many at its launch, only to explode in value, making early buyers incredibly wealthy. While some took the leap and secured life-changing returns, others hesitated, waiting for a “better time” to buy. The pain of missing out on massive gains is something every crypto trader knows too well, but history always presents a second chance. Right now, that second chance is Qubetics ($TICS)—and the window to get in early is closing fast. Unlike hype-driven projects, Qubetics is built for real-world utility, tackling blockchain development barriers with its QubeQode IDE and creating a seamless multi-chain ecosystem. It’s not just another token—it’s a fully-fledged blockchain platform with strong fundamentals and high adoption potential. With its Qubetics presale attracting serious attention, early adopters are securing their positions before prices climb higher. Opportunities like this don’t wait. If you missed AAVE’s early days, don’t make the same mistake again—Qubetics could be one of the best cryptos to buy this month. Qubetics: The Best Crypto to Buy This Month Before It’s Too Late Qubetics’ early supporters had a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity—whitelist members secured $TICS at just $0.01 with zero upfront investment. Since its launch on September 29, 2024, the presale has progressed through multiple stages, with prices increasing by 10% every seven days. Now, Qubetics is in its 25th presale stage, priced at just $0.1074, and it’s still one of the best cryptos to buy this month before it hits exchanges. With over $15 million raised, more than 23,000 token holders, and 499 million $TICS tokens sold, Qubetics is proving it’s a force to be reckoned with. But what really makes it one of the best cryptos to buy this month is the potential ROI for those who invest early. If you put in $1,000 today: If $TICS reaches $0.25, your investment becomes $2,326 (132.66% ROI) If $TICS hits $1, your portfolio grows to $9,206 (830.65% ROI) If $TICS reaches $5, you’d be sitting on $46,500 (4,553.26% ROI) If $TICS hits $10, that $1,000 turns into $92,065 (9,206.51% ROI) At $15, you’d have $138,597 (13,859.77% ROI) It’s no wonder why early investors are calling Qubetics one of the best cryptos to buy this month. Beyond its financial upside, Qubetics is reshaping blockchain development with its QubeQode IDE. Right now, creating blockchain applications requires extensive coding knowledge, making it inaccessible for many businesses. QubeQode IDE eliminates this barrier by offering a drag-and-drop interface, form-based configuration, and a code snippet library, allowing even non-developers to create blockchain-powered applications effortlessly. Imagine a small business wanting to build a secure tokenized rewards program for its customers. Instead of hiring a team of blockchain developers, they can use QubeQode IDE to set up their system in minutes—no coding required. Or think about a gaming studio that wants to integrate NFTs and in-game assets on multiple blockchains. With QubeQode, they can do it seamlessly, without writing complex smart contracts from scratch. This kind of accessibility is what makes Qubetics more than just another crypto—it’s a game-changing blockchain ecosystem. But time is running out. With each stage lasting just seven days, the price is about to increase again. If you’re serious about crypto, this is the best crypto presale to get into before it’s too late. AAVE: The Crypto That Left Many Watching From the Sidelines AAVE’s story is a painful reminder that the best investment opportunities don’t wait. When AAVE first launched, many dismissed it as just another DeFi lending protocol, failing to see the groundbreaking potential behind its liquidity pools and decentralized borrowing system. Those who ignored it at its early stages missed out on one of the biggest success stories in DeFi. During its ICO phase, AAVE was trading for mere cents, but once its ecosystem gained traction, the price skyrocketed. AAVE’s all-time high left many regretting their hesitation, as early investors saw unbelievable returns while skeptics could only watch from the sidelines. Today, AAVE remains one of the most recognized DeFi platforms, proving that early adoption is the key to making life-changing gains in crypto. Right now, Qubetics is in the same position AAVE was before its breakout. It has strong fundamentals, a real-world use case, and a fast-moving presale that’s attracting serious attention. The difference? You still have time to act before Qubetics goes mainstream. The question is, will you take this opportunity, or will you let history repeat itself? Final Thoughts: Don’t Watch From the Sidelines—Join This Crypto Presale Now You saw what happened with AAVE—early adopters won big, while those who hesitated missed out. Qubetics is now in that same early-stage window, and with over $15 million raised, the momentum is undeniable. Among the best cryptos to buy this month, Qubetics stands out with its real-world applications, strong fundamentals, and massive ROI potential. But time is running out. Each presale stage lasts only seven days, meaning the price will rise again soon. The best move? Join this crypto presale now before it’s too late. The best cryptos to buy this month aren’t just about speculation—they’re about recognizing the future before everyone else does. Will you be the one who takes action, or will you watch another opportunity slip away?

The G7 foreign ministers issued the warning through a joint statement after their meeting in Canada, as President Donald Trump, who is pushing for a truce, tries to get President Vladimir Putin to sign on. Ukraine had already agreed to a 30-day ceasefire, but Russia hesitated. Marco Rubio, Trump’s Secretary of State, told the G7 that Washington was still trying to figure out if Putin was delaying negotiations on purpose. “The question is, are we actually moving towards a ceasefire, or is this a delay tactic?” Rubio said. While the G7 is threatening economic retaliation, Trump has held back from immediate US sanctions, hoping diplomacy can work first. US President Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin in 2016. Photograph: Chris McGrath/Getty Images – The Guardian The €300 billion in Russian central bank assets, mainly cash and government bonds, have been frozen since 2022, and there is increasing momentum to use it against Moscow. Rubio indicated that any ceasefire deal would require both sides to make concessions. “I’ve never heard Trump say that Russia has a right to take all of Ukraine and do whatever they want there,” Rubio said on Friday. Meanwhile, Trump’s national security team is set to meet after Steve Witkoff, the president’s envoy, returns from Moscow with updates on where Putin stands. For months, Washington focused on pressuring Kyiv to agree to an end to the war, but now that Putin has stalled, the attention has turned to Russia. Trump, in a Truth Social post, described his recent talks with Putin as “good and productive,” but there is still no official agreement from Moscow. Canada’s Foreign Minister Mélanie Joly made it clear that the next move is on Russia. “The ball is now in Russia’s court when it comes to Ukraine,” she said . She added that the G7 was unified in its approach. The joint statement from the G7 meeting was not easy to finalize, as one official said that the Ukraine section was a subject of tense discussions overnight and the US argued that strong language could disrupt talks with Russia, so the wording was softened to avoid pissing Putin off. Britain and France, though, wanted a harsher tone, pushing for stronger economic pressure on Moscow, which makes sense as those guys have made it pretty clear how much they do not like Putin. Putin hesitates as Russian forces gain ground in Kursk While ceasefire negotiations stall, Russia’s military has advanced in Kursk, where Ukraine had previously reclaimed over 1,000 square kilometers. Despite claiming to support a ceasefire, Putin insists that “issues” need to be resolved first, while President Volodymyr Zelenskyy called it an excuse to stall negotiations some more. Trump, in another Truth Social post, claimed that the Russian military had surrounded thousands of Ukrainian troops and that he personally urged Putin to “spare their lives.” Ukraine’s General Staff denied the claim, saying that fighting in Kursk was ongoing and that no Ukrainian soldiers were surrounded. The Russian leader cut his teeth as a KGB spy in the 1980s in Dresden, an experience that left him with an enduring fascination for all things German. | POOL photo by Artyom Geodakyan/EPA-EFE – Politico In response, Putin publicly urged Ukrainian troops to surrender on Friday, saying it would align with Trump’s request. The US had temporarily cut off military aid and intelligence-sharing with Kyiv, pushing them to accept the ceasefire deal. But now that Putin is stalling, the Trump administration has resumed military assistance. “The devil is in the details, and they will start offering you details to drag you into a dialogue, delay certain processes, and postpone the end of the war,” Zelenskyy said. He is expecting a “strong reaction” from Trump in response to Putin’s lack of commitment. The biggest challenge in the negotiations remains territorial control. Zelenskyy admitted that this would be the hardest part of any peace agreement. “Ceasefire and territories are the most difficult moments [of a negotiation],” Zelenskyy said on Friday. “The first is difficult because it requires courage and political will, the second because it requires a difficult dialogue.” Cryptopolitan Academy: Want to grow your money in 2025?

Key levels to watch include $2,600, $2,500, and short-term ranges from $2,000 to $2,320, with a stop placed below $1,500. The main risk is the equities market; a relief bounce could trigger a similar reaction in crypto, particularly ETH. Bitcoin remains dominant, but a short-term bounce in ETH/BTC could see altcoins gain market share temporarily. Summary Crypto has had a crazy start to 2025, to say the least. Altcoins have been bleeding for the past few months, with Bitcoin slowly following behind—along with equities. Today, I want to discuss a potential trade idea for Ethereum ( ETH-USD ), as the market has dropped nearly 50% from its December 2024 highs of $4,000 per coin and now sitting at 1850s. I'm seeing potential for a 30% bounce on Ethereum based on the levels I'm watching. However, this is not a guarantee—nothing in the markets is (no free lunch). I'll have to play this level by level. Monthly Chart Let's start by analyzing the monthly chart. In 2022, while the market was in a bearish phase, from its all-time high the market sold off approximately 55% , bounced back, and again started its downward move creating a lower high. Now if we look at the recent data and mark the local high down to the recent low, the market has fallen approximately the same number, around 57% -which is basically the same major drop that happened in 2022. TradingView (ETH) We are also seeing a retest of the prior consolidation zone that preceded the rally in October 2023, when the overall markets bottomed and began their next leg up. This is a level where I would expect a potential reaction. Does that mean we'll bounce here and head toward all-time highs? Very unlikely. However, the point of this trading level is that there is potential for some kind of bounce. Weekly Chart Zooming into the weekly chart, I've annotated the overall trend that has been respected since the COVID low in 2020. This marks the fourth touch of this trendline, coinciding with the monthly consolidation zone I highlighted in the chart above. TradingView (ETH) The first orange-shaded area outlines the move from the low after the 55% correction from the 2022 top. This pattern is one that I'm paying attention to currently. Will I expect it to be replicated? No. Still, I'm using it to frame a potential bounce at this key area. It could be a 20% bounce, a 25% bounce, or even a 50% bounce. Or maybe not a bounce at all: this is where matters of risk management come into play, which is to be discussed later. Daily Chart Now lets take a look at the current daily chart. I've marked out the current trading range, from the high of 4,109 and the low of 1,752. The 50% level of this range is at 2,931 , which is just around a 50% move from current levels. This level would be my strong bull case short term level as in the final level I'd look to close this potential trade idea. TradingView (ETH) Below this level, we have clear areas where price previously rejected and formed resistance. The $2,600 range was a consolidation zone before the market moved lower. This will be a crucial level to watch, as any signs of weakness here would require trade management. Below that, we have the recent rejection that occurred on the Monday following the news about the Crypto Reserve. This level sits around the low $2,500s . Below these levels I am watching short term ranges from: 2000s (Would like to see a reclaim) 2150s 2320s H4 Chart The overall trend on the lower timeframes has remained bearish, so this is something I would need to see shift. We’ve started to see the potential for a short-term bottom here in the $1,700s. TradingView (ETH) In terms of market structure, I would want to see the H4 chart start forming higher highs and higher lows, signaling the potential daily/weekly retracement I'm looking for. Current Trade (Risk Management) I've provided my current trade thesis below. I will not be holding this trade all the way to the $2,900s. At the end of the day, I have no idea if ETH will have the momentum in the current environment to make a move that high, which is why I have significant levels before then within my analysis. TradingView (ETH) The stop placement here is important. This is not a random stop placed in the $1,500s because I don't want to lose a certain amount. Within my system, this is where I have to place it, as it's below a key weekly low from October 2023, where price retested the weekly trendline I discussed. This is ultimately where I would believe the bull-case bounce is unlikely. Seasonality Talk Like I discussed in my recent bull case for Bitcoin , the main risk here is equities. Based on the seasonality trend from the last 20 years, the markets typically see a potential bottom around February and March and then start to trend higher. I'm not taking this as a potential bottom signaling the continuation of the ultimate bull run we've been in, but I think this data can help frame the situation. If we do see a decent bounce before continuing lower in equities, that would, in my view, be enough to trigger a bounce in BTC/ALTs. EquityClock ETH/BTC I'm sure there are no surprises here, as I constantly preach that Bitcoin is the crypto market. BTC has outpaced ETH since 2022. The ETH/BTC pair is currently trading at the lows from December 2020! TradingView (ETH/BTC) Again, do I think this is the ultimate bottom here? Not really. I still believe Bitcoin is the dominant long-term market. But with how things are aligning, it makes sense to me that we could see the start of a potential bounce, where Bitcoin might lose some of its market share in the short term, giving altcoins a squeeze higher. Conclusion & Risks As I've stated, the main risk here is the equities market and whether we can finally see some sort of relief bounce. I believe that the macro view is still a bit shaky, and I doubt we’ll see a move straight back up toward ATHs in any risk-on markets, but that isn’t what I'm looking for here. I've started a position and outlined my key levels that I'll be watching, along with potentially locking in profits depending on how the market reacts around these price points. I hope this analysis helps and gives you another perspective on the crypto markets, especially the potential short term price action on ETH.",ETH-USD,EN,0,0,MARKET|TRADING|ETH|BTC|ALTCOIN,"{'name': 'Seeking Alpha', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/seekingalpha.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",seekingalpha,2025-03-15 21:27:53

Notably, recent market movements and mixed fundamentals have divided analysts. While some remain optimistic about Bitcoin’s potential to recover , others are sounding the alarm, with one prominent strategist warning of a potential collapse to $10,000. Mike McGlone, senior commodity strategist at Bloomberg Intelligence, warned about Bitcoin’s downside risks, citing macroeconomic factors and market trends that could lead to a severe decline. In a tweet on Friday, McGlone questioned whether Bitcoin could revisit $10,000, drawing attention to the rising price of gold and potential market headwinds. “Gold is up about the same amount in 2025 to March 13—about 15%—that Bitcoin is down. But with Bitcoin at about $80,000, what stops those trajectories?” he wrote . McGlone also pointed to a potential 6% decline in the S&P 500 as a key risk factor, adding that the current market cycle could mirror the speculative bubble seen 25 years ago. In an interview with Yahoo Finance, McGlone emphasized the appeal of traditional safe-haven assets amid economic uncertainty. “ Treasuries and gold are still the primary safe-haven plays ,” he explained , highlighting gold’s recent rally to $3,000 an ounce as evidence of growing investor caution. He also suggested that a broader market downturn could accelerate Bitcoin’s decline, stating, “ The riskiest assets are cryptos… I can point out that Bitcoin’s peak looks to be around $100,000, which is why gold continues to go up.” McGlone is not alone in predicting further downside for Bitcoin. Earlier this week, Arthur Hayes, former CEO of BitMEX, suggested that Bitcoin could drop to $70,000 before staging a recovery. According to Hayes, a 36% correction from Bitcoin’s peak of $110,000 would be “normal for a bull market.” He argued that Bitcoin’s next major rally would likely depend on worsening macroeconomic conditions and potential monetary policy shifts from major central banks, including the U.S. Federal Reserve and the European Central Bank. Elsewhere, Markus Thielen, head of research at 10x Research, suggested that Bitcoin may enter a prolonged consolidation phase after reaching its recent all-time high. He noted that Bitcoin’s current technical structure resembles a “high flag” pattern, a formation that typically signals bullish continuation. However, he warned that signs of weakness within the pattern indicate market uncertainty, making it unclear whether Bitcoin will sustain its uptrend or face further corrections. However, not all analysts foresee a steep drop. On-chain data from CryptoQuant suggests that Bitcoin is nearing an “oversold” zone, with its MVRV ratio falling to 1.8, close to the 2024 correction low of 1.71. According to the firm, if Bitcoin fell to $70,000, it could present a favorable entry point for investors and spark a rebound.

In a statement on Friday, Coinbase Institutional confirmed that its derivatives arm has filed with the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) to self-certify futures contracts for both Natural Gas (NGS) and Cardano (ADA). “We’re excited to announce that Coinbase Derivatives has filed with the CFTC to self-certify Natural Gas (NGS) futures and Cardano ($ADA) futures… We anticipate going live with these products on Monday, March 31 .,” read the tweet from Coinbase Institutional. For context, futures allow investors to bet on the future price direction of an underlying asset like ADA without needing to own the asset outright. Coinbase Institutional, a division of the global cryptocurrency exchange, was established to cater to large-scale investors, including hedge funds, asset managers, and corporations. Over the years, it has expanded its product offerings to include prime brokerage services, staking, and a range of derivative instruments designed to meet the needs of institutional clients. Notably, in the last quarter of 2024, Coinbase Institutional reported a trading volume of $345 billion, accounting for 78% of the platform’s total trades during that period. One of the most notable milestones for Coinbase Institutional was the launch of the Coinbase Derivatives Exchange, formerly known as FairX, which the company acquired in 2022. This strategic acquisition allowed Coinbase to expand its regulated derivatives offerings, addressing the growing demand for crypto futures and options among institutional investors. As of 2025, Coinbase Institutional serves thousands of institutional clients and manages billions of dollars in assets. The introduction of ADA futures signals a broader commitment to diversifying its portfolio and reinforcing its position as a leader in institutional crypto adoption. That said, including ADA futures could catalyze price appreciation, providing institutional investors with a regulated avenue to gain exposure to Cardano. Historically, the introduction of futures contracts for major cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum has led to increased liquidity and price discovery. Moreover, ADA’s potential for growth has been bolstered by its recent inclusion in a policy directive from former U.S. President Donald Trump. The executive order reportedly acknowledged ADA’s role in decentralized finance (DeFi) and blockchain innovation, positioning it favorably for regulatory clarity and institutional adoption. On the regulatory front, confidence in ADA’s standing has strengthened following key legal victories. Charges against Coinbase were dismissed in February 2025, followed by a similar outcome for Kraken in March 2025. Meanwhile, the Binance case, where ADA was also targeted, has been put on hold. This comes after the SEC initially classified ADA as an unregistered security in its 2023 lawsuits against Coinbase and Binance. That said, the launch of ADA futures on Coinbase Derivatives could mark a turning point for Cardano’s institutional adoption positioning ADA for further institutional adoption and price growth in the coming months.",Cryptocurrency|News|ADA|Cardano|Coinbase,EN,0,0,ADA|EXCHANGE|TRADING|BUSINESS|REGULATION,"{'name': 'ZyCrypto', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/zycrypto.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",zycrypto,2025-03-15 21:53:38

Ripple-affiliated cryptocurrency XRP has managed to overtake Ether (ETH) in valuation, but this only applies to their fully diluted market caps. This flipping comes amid bullish developments in the XRP ecosystem, while the Ethereum network deals with stiff competition from rivals such as Solana. XRP Surpasses Ethereum In FDV According to CoinGecko, Ethereum ranks as the second-biggest crypto, boasting a market capitalization of $231.2 billion. This is considerably bigger than XRP’s market cap of $135.7 billion. However, there seems to be a reversal of fortunes for these two top cryptocurrencies. As of press time, XRP’s fully diluted valuation stood at $234 billion. Despite the higher market cap, Ether’s FDV is lower at $232 billion. The FDV is a metric that measures the cumulative value of all existing tokens by current market price, whilst market cap only considers the tokens already in circulation. Simply put, this suggests that if all XRP tokens were in circulation, including those currently locked in Ripple’s escrow accounts, the token’s market capitalization would have usurped Ether’s. Notably, all the Ethereum tokens are already in circulation. Whether or not this FDV flipping translates into an actual market cap shift remains to be seen. At Ether’s current price of $1,923, XRP will close the market cap gap between the two assets and overthrow ETH’s reign as the second largest crypto if its price hits $4 — a roughly 67% increase from its current price of $2.35. XRP surpassed Tether’s USDT to become the industry’s third largest crypto earlier in January. If the Ripple-promoted token topples Ether, it would signal a monumental shift in the cryptosphere. All Eyes On XRP The recent XRP optimism has been fueled by Franklin Templeton’s spot XRP ETF filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The $1.5 trillion investment giant has joined other asset managers, including Bitwise, 21Shares, and WisdomTree in the race to introduce such an XRP fund in the U.S. market. Recent reports have revealed that the protracted legal spat between Ripple and the SEC is finally wrapping up. The blockchain payments firm is apparently negotiating more favorable terms after being slapped with a $125 million fine and injunction last year. Meanwhile, the SEC reportedly considers XRP a commodity rather than an unregistered security.",Cryptocurrency|News|Ethereum News|Ripple|XRP News,EN,0,0,XRP|MARKET|ETH|TRADING|REGULATION,"{'name': 'ZyCrypto', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/zycrypto.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",zycrypto,2025-03-15 21:56:32

Market signals show bearishness as Litecoin (LTC) continues its attempt to recover $150 despite maintaining its $89 price point. Before Mutuum Finance enters Phase 3 of its presale series purchasers have committed $3.4 million and secured more than 5,700 token holders thus indicating growing support for the forthcoming $0.06 exchange listing price. Presale Energy for Mutuum Finance Those participating during Mutuum Finance Presale Phase 3 can seize $0.02 tokens while preparing for a 25% growth to $0.025 which experts predict will happen within days. Project tokenomics establishes a specific financial pathway where Phase 3 investors receive 3-fold returns when they purchase at the $0.06 value. Analysts forecast that MUTM tokens will rise to $3 as people start using the lending protocol and this growth would represent a staggering 14,900% increase from their current price. The specific characteristics of this system drive positive expectations. Mutuum Finance maintains a platform model which spends fees on purchasing MUTM tokens to stimulate continuous token demand through this mechanism. The mtToken system alongside user deposits create a permanent long-term holding environment that drives users to retain tokens in their portfolio. Liquidity mining and staking initiatives which consume 74% of the supply basis make it unlikely for sell pressure to emerge after launch. Litecoin’s Uphill Battle The rising attention towards Mutuum Finance generates challenging circumstances for Litecoin. LTC trades at $89 but its momentum indicators manifest strong bearish control as traders attempt to push prices past $93.17. Presently Litecoin faces bearish conditions because the 50-day SMA stands at $118.94 above current prices and RSI-14 shows weak momentum at 32. The 14,900% growth potential of MUTM dwarfs the max $201 all-time high projection for Litecoin which reflects only a 125% increase from current levels. Market dynamics separate these two cryptocurrencies from each other. The declining daily trading volume of Litecoin at $88.6 million demonstrates that investors are losing their interest in this cryptocurrency. During the recent weeks of its presale Mutuum Finance managed to accumulate $3.4 million from intense investor interest. The Shiba Inu millionaire bets that DeFi utility within MUTM will surpass Litecoin’s store-of-value functions. Secure strategic Growth The Mutuum Finance team is completing a Certik audit of its smart contracts, a move to increase trust from investors. Once the results have been tabulated, they will be announced via official channels, further demonstrating the project’s dedication to transparency. Until then, this one is in line with its orderly growth strategy that values ecosystem stability over hype-induced peaking. Buyers are taking advantage of the last presale phase under $0.025, driving down the limited inventory for Phase 3. The window to get coins at this level is closing with exchange listings around the corner. Early participants secure a 200% gain at launch and are poised for a 500%+ growth spurt when lending pools are made live. Timing the Market Shift Litecoin has until 150 — a target the backers of Mutuum Finance say MUTM will hit first. As LTC fights resistance zones and low volatility, the swift presale of MUTM and its structured tokenomics offer a dichotomy of asymmetry. For investors looking for assets that aren’t moored to the cycles of Bitcoin, Mutuum Finance is a measured way of engaging with a burgeoning frontier of decentralized lending. Phase 3 ends soon, get your MUTM tokens for $0.02. Head over to the Mutuum Finance official site to get involved with the presale and keep up to date with the audit. The market tides shifts for the prep – act fast before the liquidity events change everything.

Beyond the well-known Bitcoin, various options present distinct technology and growth prospects. This exploration focuses on four currencies, each offering unique features that appeal to a range of participants. These four can be considered the best altcoins for different kinds of people, offering opportunities for gains. Identifying projects with practical uses, active development, and strong communities is crucial. BlockDAG (BDAG), Solana (SOL), Dogecoin (DOGE), and Cardano (ADA) have recently captured attention due to their performance. 1. BlockDAG (BDAG) BlockDAG (BDAG) aims to enhance blockchain efficiency through a directed acyclic graph (DAG) structure. This design allows for parallel transaction processing, reducing network congestion and lowering fees, thus maintaining speed and affordability. The BlockDAG presale has garnered notable interest, securing over $202.5 million with the sale of more than 18.8 billion coins. Currently priced at $0.0248 in batch 27, early participants have observed a 2380% increase. The central concept of the original article’s BlockDAG section centered on the project’s technological approach to transaction processing. Many consider BDAG one of the best altcoins, given its rapid presale expansion and advanced technology. Developers emphasize scalability, highlighting that BlockDAG’s parallel processing eliminates bottlenecks common in traditional blockchain systems. The community shows considerable enthusiasm for the potential impact of this design on decentralized applications. If BlockDAG meets its objectives, it could capture a substantial portion of the market from slower competitors. The combination of strong funding, an engaged community, and advanced architecture positions BDAG as a promising option for those interested in long-term digital currency participation. 2. Solana (SOL) Solana (SOL) remains a top choice among the best altcoins due to its high-speed blockchain, which can handle thousands of transactions per second with minimal fees. It has established itself as a leading platform for decentralized finance, non-fungible tokens, and decentralized application development, attracting both developers and users. Solana’s expanding ecosystem makes it a viable alternative to other major blockchain platforms. Despite its capabilities, Solana has experienced network disruptions, raising concerns about reliability. Developers continue to work on improvements, although some users remain cautious. Nonetheless, with a solid history in decentralized applications and prominent partnerships, Solana maintains a strong presence in the digital currency space. Currently trading around $151, Solana is a suitable option for those seeking a fast, efficient blockchain with practical applications. 3. Dogecoin (DOGE) Dogecoin (DOGE), initially conceived as a lighthearted project, has become one of the best altcoins due to its dedicated community and increasing real-world applications. Once viewed as a simple meme coin, Dogecoin has gained acceptance as a legitimate payment method, with numerous brands and merchants adopting it. Its low transaction fees and quick processing make it ideal for small transactions and tipping. Support from figures like Elon Musk has contributed to Dogecoin’s continued relevance, with speculation often driving price increases. However, critics point out that its unlimited supply could limit long-term value appreciation. Priced at $0.2105, DOGE remains popular among retail users who appreciate its accessibility, humor, and strong community. Whether for entertainment or potential gains, Dogecoin continues to demonstrate its resilience. 4. Cardano (ADA) Cardano (ADA), currently priced at $0.9538, adopts a scientific approach to blockchain development, prioritizing security, scalability, and sustainability. Its Ouroboros proof-of-stake consensus is recognized for its energy efficiency and network security. Many see Cardano as one of the best altcoins because of its systematic upgrades and commitment to decentralization. A key feature of Cardano is its focus on smart contracts and decentralized finance applications. However, some critics suggest that its development pace is slow, with upgrades taking longer than anticipated. Despite this, Cardano continues to advance with innovations like zero-knowledge smart contracts, which could significantly enhance privacy and scalability. For those seeking a secure, research-driven blockchain, ADA remains a reliable option. Wrapping Up Participants have numerous choices. BlockDAG appeals to those seeking speed, scalability, and substantial growth potential. Solana attracts developers requiring fast transactions with low fees. Dogecoin thrives on community and microtransactions, while Cardano emphasizes a methodical, research-based approach. Each has its strengths, but BlockDAG presents a particularly compelling opportunity. With significant presale gains, an accessible entry price, and an ambitious development plan, it meets many key criteria. For those pursuing advanced features, profitability, or long-term potential, BDAG could be a prime choice among the best altcoins .

While BTC’s price has often floundered towards the end of the week in 2025, the premier cryptocurrency would be hoping to have a different journey over the next few days. Is $90,000 The Next Stop For Bitcoin Price? Fortunately, the future seems bright for the world’s largest cryptocurrency after crypto analyst Ali Martinez took to the X platform to share an exciting bullish prognosis for the Bitcoin price. According to the trader, the price of BTC could be on its way to the psychological $90,000 level. Related Reading: Ethereum Consolidates Since ‘The Big Dump’ – Local Trend Reversal Or Continuation? The rationale behind this positive prediction is the appearance of an ascending triangle pattern on the 1-hour timeframe of the Bitcoin chart. The ascending triangle is a pattern in technical price analysis featuring an inverse right-angled triangle with a horizontal upper boundary (connecting a series of lower highs) and a diagonal rising lower trendline (connecting the swing lows). An ascending triangle formation is usually considered a bullish chart pattern, indicating the continuation of the original upward trend. However, an ascending triangle formation can also serve as a trend reversal pattern and a bearish signal — when the asset’s price breaks down the lower trendline and in the opposite direction of the initial uptrend. As observed in the highlighted chart, the Bitcoin price seems to be breaking out of the triangle pattern through the horizontal upper trendline around $84,000. In his post, Martinez noted that a convincing and sustained close above this level the premier cryptocurrency could make a play for the psychological $90,000 level. The price target for an ascending triangle pattern is determined by adding the vertical distance between the horizontal and rising trendlines to the breakout point. A Bitcoin price leap to $90,000 would represent an almost 7% move from the current price point. As of this writing, the flagship cryptocurrency is valued at around $84,400, reflecting an almost 5% price surge in the past 24 hours. Can Rising Whale Activity Push BTC Price Up? If the Bitcoin price is going to reclaim the $90,000 level, it’s going to need all the buying pressure it can get from investors. Interestingly, the largest class of BTC investors (whales) seem to already be in the party, continuously loading their bags over the past few days. In a separate post on X, Martinez disclosed that whales that own between 1,000 and 10,000 coins have added to their holdings in recent days. Data from Santiment shows this class of whales has acquired 20,000 BTC in the last 24 hours. This high buying activity from Bitcoin whales could offer BTC’s price the necessary bullish impetus to move to $90,000.

The services will be provided through its majority-owned subsidiary, Crypto Finance, which will act as a sub-custodian. Clearstream’s Offering According to a Bloomberg report , Clearstream will offer custody services for Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) to its 2,500 clients starting next month. The company also plans to introduce support for other cryptocurrencies and expand its offerings to include staking, lending, and brokerage capabilities. “With this offering, we are creating a one-stop shop around custody, brokerage, and settlement,” said Jens Hachmeister, head of issuer services and new digital markets at the firm. He also stated that the move would allow it to provide services for assets such as stablecoins and tokenized securities in the future. According to Crypto Finance CEO Stijn Vander Straeten, the organization began planning this service roughly a year ago. The executive added that the strategy would enable banks and large institutions to adopt digital assets more quickly by using familiar technology and compliance tools. Clearstream is one of Europe’s largest clearing houses, with approximately $21.7 billion in assets under management (AUM) as of January this year. Clients of the company’s central securities depository will be able to access crypto custody and settlement services using their existing accounts with Clearstream Banking SA. Growing Demand Under MiCA Traditional financial institutions have been increasing their presence in digital assets in response to regulatory clarity in regions such as the European Union (EU), Singapore, and the United Arab Emirates (UAE). Vander Straeten stated that demand from international banking clients has been “very high” since the Markets in Crypto-Assets Regulation (MiCA) took effect on December 30, 2024. He noted that management firms at these institutions often spend as much as €5 million to build and maintain internal crypto teams. “Here is a chance to have that at zero additional cost,” he said. The latest offering follows a recent milestone in Germany, where Boerse Stuttgart Digital Custody became the first crypto asset service provider in the country to obtain a full MiCA authorization. Under the Europe-wide license, the organization is now a regulated infrastructure provider for banks, brokers, and asset managers. Meanwhile, Spanish bank BBVA SA received regulatory approval on Monday to launch crypto trading services for retail clients. The financial institution plans to initially provide trading services for BTC and ETH through its mobile banking app, with a phased rollout starting with a select group of customers before expanding nationwide.

The leading crypto asset, Bitcoin (BTC), has dropped to $84,423, and Ethereum (ETH) has also slipped to $1,942. This bearish downturn has caused the overall crypto market value to shrink to $2.73 trillion, down from $2.83 trillion last week. NFT sales have also taken a hit , falling to $109.2 million, a 7.84% decline. However, while sales are down, more people are joining the market. Buyers have jumped by almost 700%, and sellers have increased by over 400%. This means more activity is happening, even though the total money spent on NFTs is lower. NFT Sales Drop, But More People Are Buying Ethereum NFT sales dropped 11.28% to $32.7 million. Even so, the number of buyers has more than doubled, showing that interest in NFTs is still strong. Wash trading, where people trade NFTs to fake demand, has also decreased by almost 29%, which suggests that the market is becoming more genuine. Bitcoin NFTs performed better , rising 4.63% to $22.8 million, while other blockchain NFTs had mixed results. Mythos Chain stayed steady at $15 million, and Polygon (POL) grew slightly to $13.8 million. Solana struggled, with sales falling 43.44% to $10.1 million. Courtyard led Solana collections with $12.2 million in sales despite a 33% transaction drop. Top NFT Collections Saw Big Changes Several popular NFT collections also lost value while new ones are gaining attention. DMarket remained strong with $9.8 million in sales. BRC-20 NFTs struggled, dropping by 23.41% to $5.6 million. One of the biggest surprises was Quantum Cats, a new Bitcoin-based NFT collection, which surged by 349.19% to reach $3.9 million in sales. CryptoPunks lost 55.55% of its value and brought in only $3.1 million. The Paradise collection had an even worse week, crashing by 72.58%. Despite declining overall sales, some NFT collectibles still sold for high prices. Two Beeple NFTs were among the most expensive, selling for $464,480 and $441,000. Another NFT from Known Origin went for $390,000. CryptoPunks still had some big sales , with two collections selling for $251,307 and $246,449. What’s Next for NFTs? The Non-Fungible Token market is changing. Even though sales are decreasing, more people still buy and sell digital collectibles. This shows that people are still interested but spending less money. The future of NFTs will depend on the future actions of both Bitcoin and Ethereum. If their prices keep dropping, NFT sales might fall even more. However, the growing number of buyers and sellers could help NFTs recover if the crypto market becomes stable.

Analysts like Egrag Crypto have also alluded to the coin’s historical performance in 2017 as the reason it could enjoy massive gains in this bull run. Insight Into The Crypto’s Current Price Action In an X post, Dark Defender stated that the XRP price is forming Wave 1 on the daily chart. He remarked that he expects the crypto to move towards $2.42 first. The analyst affirmed that the real momentum will start after XRP stands above the Ichimoku clouds. The analyst then highlighted $2.22 and $2.04 as the support levels to watch out for while the targets are $4.2932 and $5.8563. As CoinGape reported, crypto analyst Rose Premium also predicted that XRP could soon reach $5 as BlackRock gears up for ETF filing. Egrag Crypto stated that XRP’s dominance is showing tremendous strength. He noted that the dominance is on the verge of closing above the 2021 high of 6%, surpassing Fib 0.6, which he considers a critical level and a super bullish sign once this close happens. The analyst further remarked that if the dominance successfully closes above Fib 0.5, it could surge straight to Fib 0.888, which is his target of 15 to 20%. He added that this would align with the highs from 2015. It is worth mentioning that the Egrag Crypto previously asserted that XRP will flip Ethereum to become the second-largest crypto by market cap. In another X post, the analyst stated that XRP’s Relative Strength Index (RSI) is steadily ticking upwards and that it is just a matter of time before market participants witness a celestial move. Egrag Crypto also highlighted key RSI targets. He stated that 70 is for bullish confirmation, 77 is for bullish momentum, 85 is for bullish continuation, and 89 is for a parabolic rally for the XRP price.

The maiden cryptocurrency currently trades above $84,000 following its minor recovery in the latter part of last week. However, the continuity of the current bull run remains uncertain barring a sustained uptrend. Related Reading: Bitcoin’s MVRV Ratio Nears Key Level—Will This Trigger a Major Reversal? Bitcoin’s Bullish Chart Pattern Hints At Major Price Surge In an X post on March 14, Egrag Crypto states the BTC market may be preparing for a major price breakout. According to the technical analysis shared by the trading expert, Bitcoin has formed a Cup and Handle pattern hinting a major bullish move is on the horizon. For context, the Cup and Handle pattern represents a textbook bullish formation that occurs when an asset experiences a rounded bottom i.e. the cup followed by a slight pullback i.e. the handle before a breakout to new highs. This is well illustrated in the weekly chart below following BTC’s price action in the past two years. According to Egrag Crypto, the premier cryptocurrency is on the verge of a breakout with multiple potential price targets in sight. The non-logarithmic target presents a conservative possible price peak of $113,000. Meanwhile, the logarithmic scale which accounts for historical exponential gains points to a price target of $260,000. Taking an average of both methods, Egrag Crypto has picked a personal target of $186,000. The analyst also favors a potential price peak at $175,000 as indicated by the Fibonacci extension level of 1.618 which has historically acted as a reliable cycle top indicator. However, while this analysis presents a robust bullish prediction, Bitcoin must first experience a pullback to around $65,000 to initiate this price surge.

Amidst Bitcoin’s larger struggles, IntoTheBlock also reports that exchange inflows grew by $840 million suggesting a weakening market confidence as investors move to sell their assets. At press time, the crypto market leader is valued at $84,545 reflecting a 3.12% gain in the past day. However, reported losses of 1.76% and 13.11% in the past seven and 30 days indicate a dominant bearish influence in recent weeks.

The DOGE token has only been trading at $0.17 so far, even as investors continue to cash out their holdings. The token dropped from its peak in February and could fall even further if selling pressure persists. Miners offloaded over 65 million #Dogecoin $DOGE in just 48 hours! pic.twitter.com/h6zvgAn3W4 — Ali (@ali_charts) March 15, 2025 DOGE miners dump 65 million tokens in two days When miners sell off large amounts of tokens, it’s usually driven by profitability concerns or market pressure from price instability. The Dogecoin token has seen its miners dump 65 million tokens in just two days. Some analysts have even hinted that the token could fall below the $0.15 mark if the selling pressure continues to rise. However, some believe that the token could soon overcome its decline and surge thereafter. For instance, Trader Tardigrade thinks the token could surge if the trend keeps up. He commented, “Dogecoin HUGE Surge is coming.” He added that in previous years, whenever a breakout led to a correction phase, the token would experience a price rise soon after. He insisted that if investors continue to sell their tokens, Dogecoin could hit $1 or even more over the long term. Additionally, analyst ByllifyX believes the token could hit $3 soon. Some even stated that if more buyers come in, the token could spring back above $0.17 in the short term. Historically, when Bitcoin declines, the entire crypto ecosystem is affected, and altcoins like DOGE typically see increased volatility. Bitcoin is trading slightly below $85000, falling from its high of $90000 earlier this month. Some analysts have thus attributed DOGE’s current price action and market state to Bitcoin’s downturn and inflation fears. Musk’s involvement with the Department of Government Efficiency called for investor attention to the DOGE token When Donald Trump announced plans to create a digital asset stockpile, DOGE jumped nearly 20% to $0.24 despite not being listed among the altcoins featured in the stockpile. On Monday, whales purchased 140 million DOGE in just 24 hours. Martinez had even posted that investors had bought up 910 million tokens over the weekend. Some analysts tied the renewed interest in the token to Elon Musk’s involvement with the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE). They argued that the government agency’s use of the same acronyms as the token contributed to the surge in the token. On the Joe Rogan Experience last week, Musk acknowledged the connection between the token and the agency. He claimed that he was going to name the agency the Government Efficiency Commission, which was “very boring.” However, he stated that he followed people’s advice online on the Department of Government Efficiency, which fit perfectly. However, with more miners offloading their holdings, the future of the Dogecoin remains unclear. Cryptopolitan Academy: Want to grow your money in 2025?

According to the latest assessment, XRP is once again approaching key resistance levels and testing critical trend lines. According to the analytics firm, XRP is struggling against the descending trendline and the $2.48 resistance. A successful break above this level could be an early bullish signal. It is crucial to maintain the support range between $2.19 and $2.23 to continue the short-term bullish momentum. Here are the critical areas in the XRP price according to company analysts: $2.48 – $2.65: This is a key resistance zone. A confirmed break above $2.65 could attract more buyers and strengthen the bullish sentiment. $2.80-$3.06: A key resistance area where XRP could face selling pressure. However, if XRP manages to break out sustainably, it would suggest a strong bullish reversal. $2.03: A key support level, if XRP drops back to this price it could signal weakness and a bearish outlook. $1.54 – $1.40: This “Golden Pocket” could act as a target in case of strong selling pressure.

The Hedera (HBAR) price surge has grabbed attention, jumping 10% in a day as speculation over an ETF listing builds momentum. Meanwhile, the Chainlink (LINK) price drop is adding pressure, with the token hovering near the critical $10 mark, raising concerns about further losses. Amid these contrasting moves, BlockDAG (BDAG) stands out. Its successful Halborn audit and an ongoing CertiK review have strengthened its position as one of the most secure projects among popular crypto coins. With a presale that has already raised $202 million and delivered a 2380% price surge, BlockDAG continues to defy expectations. Hedera (HBAR) Price Surge Continues as ETF Speculation Builds The Hedera (HBAR) price surge shows no sign of slowing, climbing 10% in one day to hit $0.2487. This increase comes as talk intensifies over a potential Grayscale Hedera ETF. Some believe this could bring in institutional investors, especially as the SEC evaluates a 19b-4 application for the ETF’s NASDAQ listing. With optimism rising, HBAR’s market cap has surpassed $10.42 billion. The Hedera (HBAR) price surge has been in motion since February 25, delivering a 28% gain so far. If the ETF receives approval, it may give investors a way to gain HBAR exposure without directly holding the token. Chainlink (LINK) Price Drop Raises Concerns Over Falling Below $10 The Chainlink (LINK) price drop has deepened, with LINK slipping under $15 and drawing increased scrutiny. Traders are watching closely as LINK continues its downward trend from previous highs above $30. The token has been forming lower highs and struggling to hold onto key support zones. Attention is now on the $12-$13 range, an area that has historically prevented steeper declines. However, if selling continues, the Chainlink (LINK) price drop could test the $10 psychological barrier. While the Relative Strength Index suggests LINK is nearing oversold territory, it remains uncertain whether a reversal is imminent or if further losses are ahead. BlockDAG’s Halborn Audit Success Sparks Momentum in Presale BlockDAG just checked a major box that many crypto projects overlook—a clean bill of health from Halborn audit . In a space where hacks and exploits are almost expected, this independent validation isn’t just impressive; it’s a game-changer. It confirms what early supporters hoped for: BlockDAG’s infrastructure is built to withstand the kind of vulnerabilities that have toppled other platforms. With the CertiK audit still underway, BlockDAG is doubling down on security, separating itself from the pack. In a market where trust is rare and security failures are common, BlockDAG’s commitment to safeguarding assets is turning heads. Among popular crypto coins, it’s starting to look like one of the few you might actually be able to count on. Security isn’t just a feature—it’s survival. The history of smart contract hacks and data breaches makes it clear: without rock-solid defenses, no project lasts. BlockDAG seems to get that. Its focus on verified security is creating something rare in crypto: stability. And with stability comes growth. That’s why BlockDAG is being talked about as one of the most popular crypto coins to watch. It’s no coincidence that BlockDAG’s Halborn and CertiK audits are fueling a presale that’s smashing through milestones. Over $201 million has already been raised, and more than 18.7 billion BDAG coins have been sold. Since batch 1, when prices were $0.001, BDAG has soared to $0.0248 by batch 27—an eye-watering 2380% increase. Now, the presale’s $600 million target feels less like a long shot and more like the next logical step. Each new batch brings a higher price tag, and the early days of cheap BDAG are fading fast. The pace is relentless, and the hype isn’t slowing down. BlockDAG’s moment is here—and it’s turning into one of those rare opportunities that traders later say they wish they’d jumped on sooner. Key Highlights! The Hedera (HBAR) price surge remains a key focus, with ETF approval potentially unlocking new levels of institutional interest. Meanwhile, the Chainlink (LINK) price drop has placed investors on edge, though there is cautious optimism that support levels may hold. BlockDAG, however, continues to stand apart. Its Halborn audit success and ongoing CertiK review are driving trust, helping it rank high among popular crypto coins . With $202 million raised and prices steadily climbing, BlockDAG’s presale shows no signs of slowing. For traders and buyers, it’s becoming harder to ignore the impact of these developments—and missing out now could prove costly later.

The Ethereum ( ETH )-based virtual reality platform Decentraland ( MANA ) ranks second, clocking 168.93 events, and the Ethereum layer-2 protocol Skale Network ( SKL ) is a distant third with 41.07.

Source: Santiment/X Santiment notes that it doesn’t count routine updates and uses a “better methodology” to collect data for GitHub events based on a “backtested process.” The analytics firm has previously said that heavy development activity centered around a crypto project is a positive indication that could mean that the developers believe the protocol will be successful. It also indicates that the project is less likely to be an exit scam. MultiversX is a distributed, proof-of-stake blockchain network that is decentralized via more than 3,500 nodes. The project aims to help developers build next-gen applications. The project’s native token, EGLD, is trading at $18.10 at time of writing.

Although Shiba Inu (SHIB) loyalists are already dreaming of some 9x in the future, experts are now talking about other coins that can beat such growth up to 2025. Two of the most commonly cited rivals are Toncoin (TON) and Remittix (RTX) with each of them offering something different that has the potential to beat the performance of SHIB. Shiba Inu’s 9x Potential Shiba Inu is still a heavyweight in meme token spheres with approximately 9x growth potential based on various expectations. A changelly analysis of the SHIB future bull run places it at over $0.000032 if the hype never fades and massive burns are maintained. These are expectations founded on the community’s dedication, in addition to improvements such as Shibarium that will continue to lower transaction costs and drive DeFi adoption. Despite such positive signals, some experts are worried about the sheer supply of SHIB. Although over 410 trillion have been burnt out of circulation, 100x potential may be constrained by market limitations. In order for Shiba Inu to double-digitize in the upcoming cycle, it must solidify meaningful utility beyond meme mania. If whales start worrying about diminishing returns, they are going to rotate into more practical altcoins making it easier for coins like Toncoin and Remittix to outpace it. Toncoin Utility Advantage Toncoin stands out for robust tech previously associated with Telegram. TON was constructed as a fast and secure blockchain of the layer-1 variety, optimized for making global-scale transactions with minimal fees. A Benzinga analysis of Toncoin price forecasts puts the token’s price at $10 - $48 in 2025, indicating upside beyond the realm of typical altcoin growth. That excitement is based on TON’s thriving network of dApps linking Telegram groups and broader crypto adoption. TON/USDT Chart. Source: TradingView Since it is a chain with tangible throughput, TON is capable of processing several thousand transactions per second that can be addressed for DeFi and NFT markets. If greater adoption is achieved through mainstream adoption, toncoin’s comparatively minimal market cap can multiply manifold. Even the lower-end projections are around 5x returns, which can outdo the best-case scenario of SHIB if hype for the latter’s meme coin wears off. Toncoin has to stand out in the deluge of smart contract platforms with some special developer tools or bridging Telegram users seamlessly. Remittix Puts Up Remittix has introduced a totally different thinking with emphasis on cross-border finance and applied finance. At $0.0734 price at presale 518 million sold it has raised $13.8 million, indicating confidence of the investors. A cover story of finbold on Remittix for making global remittances explains that diaspora groups would be using Remittix for near-instant and feeless currency exchange. A Philippine farming supplier receiving stablecoins from an Australian importer and exchanging them directly into pesos through a local agent is one of the applications. This simple solution is relief for functional users who are fed up with high bank charges. If pilot transactions in Africa and Southeast Asia ever get off the ground, Remittix may fly past established tokens in terms of growth. Conclusion Optimists are expecting up to 50x within 2025 if the platform is capable of securing major finance deals. PayFi's narrative for the token incorporating crypto into everyday transactions resonates with those searching for practical uses rather than speculation. Their investors appreciate that real-world utility can protect RTX from the volatility that is so typical of meme coins. Presale hype suggests that Remittix would attract significant liquidity once listed. Gains would be on the strength of gaining ties with major remittance operators or e-wallets, which would boost volumes and token demand. If the diaspora adoption continues to build momentum, the rise of the coin may even surpass the 9x potential of SHIB and Remittix would be one of the leaders for huge returns. Shiba Inu targets niche groups for memes, TON bets on blockchain superiority and RTX attacks cross-border inefficiencies directly. Shiba Inu may even have the potential to provide 9x while TON's forays into DeFi and Remittix's PayFi drives can provide such returns more safely especially as mainstream adoption begins to pick up speed. Ultimately, the best fit depends on risk appetite as well as faith in practical applications vs brand-fueled mania. Interested in learning about this remittance-based altcoin that could outgrow SHIB's development? Take a look at Remittix and find out how connecting crypto and day-to-day payments can bring higher returns than meme or brand-based hype.

Mixed Signals From Key Indicators Raise Questions!,https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2025/03/can-ethereum-eth-still-shine-in-2025-mixed-signals-from-key-indicators-raise-questions,"Deeper into 2025, the attitude toward ETH is mixed; vital facts point to both good and negative possibilities. Although some experts believe Ethereum is primed for a recovery, others argue on whether the asset may still show significant increases this year since technical indicators point to a likely decline. Meanwhile, Remittix , is poised to completely reimagine modern cross-border transactions with its exclusive crypto-to-fiat conversion technology. Read on to learn more. Ethereum’s Technical Indicators Show Warning Signs Ethereum fell below the critical $2,000 psychological level for the first time since December 2023, raising concerns amongst investors. ETH has subsequently risen above this level, however the most recent pricing action signals to still strong bearish pressure. Early 2025 performance of the asset has been particularly concerning as ETH revealed negative monthly closures in January and February a pattern not seen in its history. Analyst Ali Martinez said Ethereum would potentially collapse to lower levels, falling to $1,600 or perhaps $1,200. Based on Ethereum dropping below the bottom limit of a parallel channel, his analysis suggests that additional downside could be set to hit. This aligns with certain traders' concerns, like those who believe Ethereum won't show a noteworthy return until it gathers major momentum. While some experts have a negative opinion, others believe Ethereum could have already peaked. Based on what he believes to be the most important point of interest for a price reversal, crypto analyst Titan of Crypto recently informed that ETH has reached a notable level of support. Based on ETH's daily chart, which shows that the low for 2024 has been wiped, his analysis indicates that an upward trend might be created. As of now, Ethereum is trading at around about $1,928 ; over 24 hours, it has increased over 1.46%. Though the future is unclear, institutional adoption and more broad market movements will decide the long-term prospects of the asset. Remittix is attracting interest for its optimistic future whereas Ethereum's is unknown. Remittix Is Poised For A Massive Rally Providing rapid and competitively priced cross-border solutions, Remittix (RTX) is reinventing global payments by combining FIAT transactions with blockchain technology. Remitix is the superior substitute for traditional payment companies like Stripe and Wise. By supporting over 50 crypto pairings and 30+ FIAT currencies, both crypto-exclusive platforms like Coinbase Wallet and Remittix offer accessibility and inclusiveness for enterprises and consumers, thereby simplifying global commerce. Notable also is the open flat-fee strategy of the platform, which provides savings and openness over ridiculous rates of exchange of traditional banks. Remittix is groundbreaking in the payments sector as it ensures that the whole amount sent reaches the receiver. Why $RTX Is A Good Investment The RTX currency has a good investment potential at $0.0734 at the presale stage. Forecasts show an intriguing surge; demand for creative cross-border payment solutions is creating a 25x multiplier in the presale period and over 1,500% rises post launch.

Elsewhere, Shiba Inu (SHIB) investors are gearing up for potential losses as investor sentiment takes a hit. While XRP remains the sector leader, some traders are discovering their way to another viral token that is gaining momentum fast. One such project that is attracting tremendous eyeballs is Remittix (RTX) . XRP and SHIB are bankrolled on institutional adoption and meme coin momentum. RTX, on the other hand, is trying to address practical financial problems. With crypto transactions gaining mainstream acceptance like never before, investors are wondering if and when RTX might surpass XRP and SHIB in the long term. XRP Gains Strength as Market Confidence Grows XRP has risen around 2.78% in the last 24 hours to trade at around $2.44. Even as the price has been increasing, the volume of XRP is down 3.76% at $4.63 billion as traders remain indecisive. With XRP making more financial deals, it is likely to grow according to most investors. There are some traders who are less confident, nevertheless, as the long-term fate of XRP relies so significantly on regulatory progress and whether it can become more mainstream into existing banks. Even as XRP’s payment network remains solid, some investors are looking for options such as RTX that offer quicker and more accessible financial services for consumers and enterprises. Shiba Inu (SHIB) Faces Growing Uncertainty Shiba Inu has risen around 1% in the past 24 hours and is now trading at around $0.00001283. Its volume decreased by 15.80% to $155.19 million as the hype for SHIB is fading away. While the development of SHIB’s ecosystem, like Shibarium and DeFi integrations, has helped sustain investor interest, the challenge from newer projects is growing. Meme coins find long-term viability difficult and SHIB will need more than community hype in order to remain relevant. SHIB investors looking for diversification are finding their way into RTX as it stands as a payment-centric crypto with stronger long-term growth fundamentals than meme coins. Remittix (RTX): The Payments Token Gaining Momentum Remittix (RTX) is gaining momentum as one of the major players in the blockchain payment market with zero-fee crypto-to-fiat transfers. At $0.0734, more than $13.8 million has been raised and 518 million tokens have been sold as of now, reflecting strong early investor demand. Unlike XRP for banks and institutions and SHIB as token -based on meme currencies, RTX is for individuals, freelancers and businesses that need frictionless payment. A businessman in Asia accepting payment from America can settle crypto into fiat immediately with the help of RTX and eliminate high bank fees and exchange rates. By means of PayFi platform, RTX is positioning itself as one of the most practical cryptocurrencies in the payment industry with genuine financial solutions and not speculation. Which Crypto Holds the Most Long-Term Potential? Traders are pitting XRP, SHIB and RTX against one another with one question in mind: which token holds the most long-term investment potential? XRP dominates bank transactions but remains uncertain until regulatory clarification. It has bank and other institution allies behind it for its use case but regulatory risk may smother adoption. SHIB is dependent on popular sentiment and meme strength, but it cannot be sustained in the long term. With no continued ecosystem growth and practical uses in the real world, SHIB’s price cannot be supported beyond speculation. RTX, meanwhile, is emerging as a serious rival with a workable financial thesis. Unlike XRP, which relies on institutional support, and SHIB, which rides on hype, RTX is providing fee-less, frictionless crypto-to-fiat payments that businesses, freelancers and cross-border traders find attractive. Invest in the Future of Blockchain Payments with Remittix (RTX) While XRP is seeing capital inflows and SHIB is languishing due to market uncertainty, RTX is emerging as a high-growth option. Its real-world use case, inexpensive transaction costs and seamless payment model make it a great pick in blockchain finance. Consider investing in one with practical uses in everyday life Go to the Remittix presale and learn why RTX can surpass XRP and SHIB in 2025.

Hedera and Mantra are pushing boundaries, aiming for top billing. Both have unique offerings and growing communities. Insights into their strategies and potential growth are poised to captivate readers eager to discover the leading contenders. Who has the upper hand? Dig in to find out. Hedera HBAR: Strong 6-Month Rise Contrasts with Recent Decline Hedera ’s price dropped by 16.48% over the past month, while a 294.50% rise over the last six months highlights a dramatic long-term gain. The coin has experienced a notable short-term contraction against a strong upward backdrop seen in its half-year performance. This mix of swift declines and robust rallies presents a dynamic history that calls attention to potential reversion opportunities. Current prices range between $0.1551 and $0.2923, with immediate resistance at $0.37 and support near $0.0967. Bears dominate the near term as momentum and oscillator indicators trend negative, suggesting trades focused on buying dips with a watchful eye on the initial resistance levels. MANTRA Market Pulse: Key Levels and Price Action The coin's price rose by nearly 10% over the past month, while the impressive six-month gain reached almost 494%. This substantial long-term increase highlights strong interest, despite a minor pullback of over 3% in recent weeks. The price history demonstrates consistent upward movement interspersed with short-term corrections, reflecting healthy fluctuations and investor engagement. Currently, the price fluctuates between $4.90 and $9.67, with support located around$ 2.26 and resistance at approximately $11.81. Bearish sentiment is present, along with a neutral RSI of 44.23, indicating a market lacking a definitive trend. Traders may find value in buying near support and exercising caution with exits near resistance during this active altcoin season. Conclusion Hedera (HBAR) and Mantra (OM) are competing for RWA crypto leadership in Q2. HBAR stands out with its innovative technology and governance model. OM attracts interest with its focus on decentralized finance services. Both coins have strong points and unique advantages. The market will decide which one gains the upper hand. For now, they both present compelling opportunities. Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

This level is more than just a line on a chart—it’s a key battleground for bulls and bears, often dictating the next major move. As ETH approaches this critical resistance, speculations on whether this could catalyze a sustained rally or a stumbling block that triggers a pullback arise. The 100-day SMA is a widely followed indicator that reflects the medium-term trend, and its significance cannot be overstated. For Ethereum, breaking above this level could reignite bullish sentiment, paving the way for higher price targets. On the flip side, a rejection might lead to further consolidation or even a retest of lower support levels Ethereum Price Struggles: Can Bulls Gain Momentum? Ethereum has been facing a tough battle as it slowly climbs toward the 100-day SMA. Despite attempts at recovery, the price has struggled to gain strong upside movement, with resistance levels capping its moves. Buyers have shown interest at key support zones, preventing further declines, but a lack of sustained volume and conviction has kept ETH from breaking higher. Related Reading: Ethereum Price Recovery Capped—Bulls Struggle Near Resistance The MACD indicator hints at a potential momentum shift in Ethereum’s price action. While the MACD and signal lines have crossed and are approaching the zero line, a confirmed bullish crossover is still lacking. Additionally, the narrowing histogram suggests a transition from bearish to neutral or bullish, but further confirmation is needed for a sustained upward move. For Ethereum to sustain a bullish move, the MACD line and signal line need to rise above average, accompanied by expanding histogram bars in the positive zone. If this occurs, it could strengthen upward momentum. However, failure to achieve a breakout leaves Ethereum vulnerable to consolidation or a downside move. What A Successful Breakout Means A breakout above the 100-day SMA would serve as a strong bullish confirmation for Ethereum, signaling renewed upward momentum and shifting market sentiment in favor of buyers. This move would suggest that Ethereum has overcome a key technical barrier, potentially attracting more investors and traders looking to capitalize on the uptrend. Related Reading: Ethereum Gained 160% The Last Time This On-Chain Indicator Flashed – Will ETH Soar Again? Ethereum could set its sights on the $2,160 resistance level if the breakout is sustained with increased volume and strong follow-through. A successful push above this level may increase the likelihood of more price appreciation toward other resistance levels, such as $2,858 and $3,360. However, if Ethereum fails to achieve a breakout above the key resistance level, it could face renewed selling pressure, leading to a fresh decline toward the $1,523 support zone. This level has historically acted as a key demand area, where buyers might attempt to prevent further downside.

Polymarket reported that Carney’s odds of winning the next federal election scheduled for October 20, 2025, had increased by 23% up to 49% from 26% last month. On the other hand, the odds of the current leader of the official opposition and the leader of the Conservative Party, Pierre Poilievre, had decreased by 21% from 72% in February to 51%. Carney’s expertise in business qualifies him to navigate Canada’s economic challenges Recently, Carney was elected leader of the Liberal Party, replacing Justin Trudeau, during ongoing historical tension and growing fears of a trade war with the U.S. under Trump’s administration. This is his first time getting involved in Canadian politics at the highest level, and a federal election is coming. On Sunday, after securing 85.9% of the vote on the first ballot, he said, “I will work day and night with one purpose, which is to build a stronger Canada for everyone.” Concerning the U.S.-Canada trade war, President Donald Trump imposed tariffs on Canada’s imports, potentially sparking a trade war. Based on Ontario, Canada, placing a 25% Tariff on ‘Electricity’ coming into the United States, Trump instructed his Secretary of Commerce to add an additional 25% tariff, to 50%, on all steel and aluminium coming into the United States from Canada, one of the highest tariffing nations anywhere in the world. Ontario’s premier, Doug Ford, threatened to shut off the US electricity supply entirely. Mark Carney said he would continue to pressure America in response to Trump’s tariff actions. “My government will keep our tariffs on until the Americans show us respect and make credible, reliable commitments to free and fair trade,” he said in a post on X. White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt said on Tuesday that Trump has yet to speak with Carney but that “his phone is always open to leaders who wish to speak with him.” Following these developments, Canadians preferred Carney over Poilievre due to his business expertise and being a former central banker. Poilievre’s support for Bitcoin and ownership of a Canadian-issued Bitcoin ETF had not been a major focus of the Canadian campaign. The Canadian federal election scheduled for October 20, 2025, could be called sooner The next federal election is scheduled for 20 October 2025. However, it might occur earlier due to certain circumstances, including when the government general accepts the prime minister’s resignation after the government is defeated in a confidence vote in parliament or when it accepts his advice to dissolve the government. Pierre Poilievre and the leader of the New Democratic Party, Jagmeet Singh, have already declared they will call for a vote of no confidence after parliament resumes. With Carney’s record still fresh and tensions with the U.S. rising, the next election—whenever it happens—will be a test of whether his economic acumen and aspirations for Canada can earn him a long-term mandate. At the same time, Poilievre and Singh’s pressure for an early election indicates the opposition believes it has a window of opportunity to challenge Carney before he settles into the role.

For PI to triple by the end of March 2025, it would need to reach around $5.55, within a two-week timeframe. Here are key potential PI market catalysts and insights to watch as the month unfolds. Current Pi Network Price Trends Recent analysis reveals that PI has undergone significant volatility. After reaching a high of $3.01 last week, the price has dropped by over 40%, reflecting a typical boom-and-bust cycle common in emerging cryptocurrencies. However, recent bullish momentum across the broader crypto market, following favourable U.S. CPI and PPI reports, has reignited interest in digital assets, including PI. Volume analysis further supports the possibility of a price rebound. Over the past 72 hours, trading volume has steadily increased, signalling renewed market interest. Rising volume typically indicates strong buying pressure, reinforcing the probability of a short-term price breakout. Why is PI Network Price Going Up? One of the biggest driving factors behind PI’s price action is speculation regarding a potential Binance listing. Over the past few months, PI has secured listings on CoinGecko, CoinMarketCap, and other major price-tracking platforms. These listings have boosted awareness, leading to increased demand. PI Network Price Action, March 15 | CoinMarketCap As depicted above, PI currently ranks 11 largest cryptocurrency network by market cap, surpassing $10.5 billion at the time of writing. Many traders and analysts believe that PI remains undervalued due to its absence from Binance, the world’s largest crypto exchange. If PI listing on Binance materialises in March, it could trigger substantial inflows from institutional and retail investors. PI Network Price Projections 2025 According to CoinMarketCap insights, PI has the potential to cross the $50 mark in 2025. Meanwhile, CoinCodex offers a more conservative projection, forecasting a 101.79% increase, which would push PI to $5.64. While these forecasts highlight PI’s upside potential, strategic traders remain aware of the broader market risks. PI Network Price Prediction, 2025 | CoinMarketCap With altcoin ETFs dominating crypto market discourse, there’s a real possibility that an approval verdict from the U.S. SEC could divert investor attention and liquidity away from PI. Assets like XRP, SOL, and ADA—each with ongoing ETF filings —could see increased institutional inflows, potentially draining PI spot demand. Binance Listing Could Spark a Parabolic Rally Having already secured listings on major crypto exchanges Bitget and OKX , the potential Binance listing would place PI in the spotlight, dramatically increasing demand. If the listing materializes in March 2025, A confirmed Binance listing could act as a game-changer for PI. Several key factors could contribute to a parabolic rally: Exchange Liquidity: Binance’s deep liquidity and global reach could significantly enhance PI’s trading volume, increasing price stability and reducing volatility during rallies. Ecosystem Expansion: Exchange listings often attract new partnerships, institutional investors, and developers, leading to broader adoption. In essence, if PI Network’s listing on Binance materialises, PI’s chances of reaching $5.55 would increase significantly. PI Network Technical Analysis: $4.5 Breakout Could Validate Triple Gains Forecast For PI to triple from $1.49 to $4.47-$5.55, it must first clear several key resistance levels: $1.58 (Middle Bollinger Band): A move above this level signals a bullish trend shift. $1.91 (Upper Bollinger Band): Breaking this resistance confirms upward momentum. $2.50 (Historical Resistance): Historically significant level that has posed a major barrier to previous rallies. $3.00 (Psychological Resistance): A surge past $3.00 milestone price level would reinforce a move toward $4.50-$5.55. PI Network Price Forecast However, failure to hold $1.25 (Lower Bollinger Band) or a breakdown below $1.00 could delay or invalidate bullish projections.

Due to this, most altcoins in the market recorded major declines, with some registering yearly lows. However, trade-war tensions and inflation in the US plunges, there’s a renewed buying interest in the altcoin market. As a result, we might see a strong recovery rally in altcoin prices next week, specifically Pi coin, Pepe meme coin and Binance coin (BNB). Altcoins Gain Spotlight Amid Bitcoin’s $85K Struggle Over the past week, the crypto market experienced significant volatility due to geopolitical tensions. As the market began to rebound, attention shifted towards altcoins. Additionally, Bitcoin’s recent difficulties in surpassing the $85K threshold have resulted in a decrease in its market dominance. This has attracted whale investors, who have been actively accumulating altcoins such as Pi, Pepe, and Binance Coin (BNB) during this period. Pi Coin Price Analysis The Pi coin price is currently facing resistance at the critical $1.5 threshold, with sellers exerting increasing pressure. As a result, the price is consolidating just below the EMA20 trend line. At present, Pi coin is trading at $1.45, having declined by over 4.5% in the last 24 hours. The PI/USDT pair is finding it challenging to reach the immediate resistance at $1.5, a level that could prove strong as short-term holders may choose to liquidate their positions at this point. Nevertheless, there is potential for buyers to overcome this barrier if demand strengthens. Should the price remain under the EMA20 trend line on the 1-hour chart, it is likely that sellers will attempt to drive it down to $1.38. A further decline from there could cement the sellers’ control, potentially lowering the price to $1.26. Conversely, with the Relative Strength Index (RSI) persisting below the midline at 40, there could be an opportunity for a retest of the resistance channel. Should the price sustain above $1.5, it would signal a shift in favor of the buyers, potentially leading to an increase up to $1.8. Pepecoin Price Analysis Pepe’s price has been edging upwards, targeting a breakthrough above the 23.6% Fibonacci retracement level, despite strong resistance from bears on the price chart. Currently, the PEPE/USDT pair encounters resistance near $0.0000075, a level where bearish sentiments tend to intensify. Yet, with the Relative Strength Index (RSI) at 57 and residing within the buying territory, there is potential for Pepe to achieve a breakout. The coin is approaching a critical test at the $0.0000075 mark, and surpassing this resistance could pave the way towards $0.000009. Conversely, increased selling pressure at these resistance points could halt any potential gains. If Pepe is unable to overcome the $0.0000075 hurdle, there’s a possibility that its price could retreat to approximately $0.000006. Binance Coin (BNB) Price Analysis Binance Coin (BNB) is currently seeing a surge in buying activity, pushing its price above the crucial $610 resistance. Currently, BNB is trading at $614, reflecting a 5% gain over the last 24 hours. On the trading charts, the BNB/USDT pair is rising exponentially above the EMA trend lines, which might lead to a break above another resistance. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) is at 78, which places BNB within the overbought region, indicating an upcoming correction. However, if BNB holds its current momentum, we might see a skyrocketing trend toward $676. On the downside, if sellers gain the upper hand, BNB could retreat to the important support level at EMA20. Should it break below this level, it may trigger a steep drop to $563, marking a significant move from the current bullish momentum.",Price Analysis|Altcoins|Bitcoin|Ethereum|Ripple (XRP),EN,0,0,BNB|TRADING|MARKET|ALTCOIN|EXCHANGE,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-03-16 01:30:00

Investors are constantly on the lookout for the best meme coins to buy now, and three standout projects— Arctic Pablo Coin ($APC), ai16z ($AI16Z), and Toshi ($TOSHI)—are leading the charge with unique value propositions and significant ROI potential. Among these top-tier meme coins, Arctic Pablo Coin is a true game-changer.

Arctic Pablo Coin ($APC): Embark on a Mystical Crypto Expedition Imagine venturing into the icy unknown with Arctic Pablo, a daring explorer on a quest to uncover the earth’s mysteries. This adventurous narrative forms the backbone of Arctic Pablo Coin ($APC), a meme coin that transcends traditional cryptocurrency storytelling. Each presale phase of $APC is not just a stage but a unique location, inviting investors to join Pablo on his thrilling journey. As of today, Arctic Pablo has arrived at Frosty Falls, the 14th location in his expedition. Here, the presale price stands at $0.000074 per $APC token. With a planned launch price of $0.008, early investors have the potential to realize an ROI exceeding 10,694.59% upon the coin’s listing. To illustrate, a $100 investment at the current price would yield approximately 1,351,304 $APC tokens, which could escalate to $10,810.43 at launch. Arctic Pablo Coin employs a deflationary model to enhance token scarcity and value. Unsold tokens from each presale phase are permanently burned weekly, reducing the total supply and fostering a deflationary environment. This strategy aims to boost investor value and ensure long-term sustainability. All token burn transactions are transparently recorded on the Binance Smart Chain (BSC). Investors can further benefit from a 66% Annual Percentage Yield (APY) staking program. By staking their $APC tokens, participants can watch their investments grow while actively contributing to the ecosystem. All staked coins are vested for two months from the launch date, encouraging long-term commitment and stability within the community. Operating on the Binance Smart Chain (BSC) as a BEP20 token, $APC offers compatibility with various cryptocurrencies, including BNB, ETH, USDT, BTC, SOLANA, and XRP, making it accessible to a broad spectrum of investors. Arctic Pablo Coin’s unique approach—melding an adventurous narrative with innovative tokenomics—positions it as one of the best new meme coins to buy now, offering an unparalleled blend of excitement and financial potential. ai16z ($AI16Z): Merging AI with Meme Culture for Strategic Gains In the realm where artificial intelligence intersects with meme culture, ai16z ($AI16Z) emerges as a pioneering meme coin.

Token holders participate in governance, voting on AI-driven investment proposals, and shaping the project’s direction. This decentralized approach empowers retail investors to engage in venture capital activities traditionally reserved for institutional players, bridging the gap between AI technology and meme coin culture. Toshi ($TOSHI): The Ultimate Meme Coin for DeFi Enthusiasts In a world where meme coins often rely purely on hype, Toshi ($TOSHI) stands out by fusing meme culture with decentralized finance (DeFi) in a fresh, innovative, and downright electrifying way. Inspired by Satoshi Nakamoto, the legendary creator of Bitcoin, Toshi isn’t just another meme token—it’s a statement about the power of decentralized communities and a nod to the origins of crypto itself. As one of the best meme coins to buy now, $TOSHI is shaking up the game with utility-driven incentives and a rapidly expanding ecosystem.

The presale has raised more than 3.4 million USD from 5,700 holders attracted to its structured lending model and growth-incentive mechanisms in underwrites. Analysts believe MUTM is uniquely positioned for huge gains, due to these factors coming together at once: rising buy pressure, smart tokenomics and real-world usage. Current participants can guarantee a 25% gain as compared to the projected $0.025 token price from Phase 4, which closes before any exchange listings would begin. Presale Momentum Builds Phase 3 is well ahead of where it should have been, as time is running out for investors to get on board with the final opportunity to purchase MUTM at $0.02. Early backers are already looking at a guaranteed 200% return at launch, with the 25% price increase for the next stage a sign of urgency ahead of a listing price of $0.06. This boom is not some kind of speculation: Mutuum Finance (MUTM) integrates purchase pressure straight into its ecosystem. A part of platform revenue is swapped for MUTM on the market automatically and redistributed to stakers and liquidity providers. This system keeps demand inflows flowing while also acting as a deterrent to sell-offs, creating a self-perpetuating cycle that analysts expect to send prices far beyond projected initial targets. ROI Projections Spark Interest Outside of the presale, predictions for Mutuum Finance (MUTM) become increasingly removed. Even in the most conservative estimates, a post-launch valuation of $3.50/token gives a 17,400% increase compared to the latest Phase 3 price. Such predictions are based on its hybrid DeFi solution, incorporating overcollateralized loans, peer-to-peer lending w/ yield generating mtTokens. Unlike meme coins or speculative assets, MUTM is a utility token that derives its value from platform usage. With increasing borrowing activity comes increasing revenue allocated to token buybacks, which forms a feedback loop further rewarding long-term holders. Mechanics of Innovation Further Prosper Another aspect that sets Mutuum Finance (MUTM) apart is the introduction of mtTokens, deposit certificates that accumulate interest over time. Users who provide assets, such as ETH or USDC, into the protocol receive mtTokens which accrue value over time, and can be redeemed for the amount equivalent of the underlying collateral + profit. These tokens can also move across DeFi platforms, increasing their utility use case outside of Mutuum’s environment. In addition to this, a $100,000 presale giveaway encouraging early involvement means the project marries short-term incentives with long-term sustainability. Security Improvements in Progress With excitement brewing, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is preparing a smart contract audit by Certik, one of the leading blockchain security companies. Results are anticipated in the coming hours/days and will confirm that a protocol is robust while safeguarding protocol investor assets. Such advances — which are uncommon among presale projects — indicate the team’s dedication to transparency and reliability, thereby setting MUTM even further apart in a competitive crypto marketplace. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is not simply following market trends, it’s creating them. As Phase 3 quickly fills and exchange listings are drawing near, the window to get your tokens at $0.02 is closing. In addition, strong presale projects leveraging similar mechanics have previously exceeded conservative targets by wide margins, and the tangible utility of MUTM serves to compound this potential. For those investors looking for bankable assets based on real world utility and not simply on hype, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) emerges as a unicorn. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) awake to the ticking of the clock on Phase 3. New entrants crystallize a 25% gain as Phase 4 fires up, plus will gain mega-multiples in gains after launch. Presale details and audit updates will be available on Mutuum Finance’s official channels..

Each year, select digital assets emerge prominently, demonstrating their resilience and potential. Currently, several names are drawing notable attention: BlockDAG (BDAG), Arbitrum (ARB), Filecoin (FIL), and Hedera (HBAR). These aren’t mere trends; they are supported by solid foundations, increasing use, and significant forthcoming events. If you’re scouting for the most popular crypto with substantial momentum, these four are worth a detailed look. With significant developments expected soon, the real question is not if they will rise, but rather how high they will soar. 1. BlockDAG (BDAG): Poised for Major Growth This Year! BlockDAG (BDAG) is on track to be one of the biggest, most popular cryptos of the year, bolstered by significant forthcoming events. Anticipated for a mainnet launch in 2025 and slated for listing on 10 major exchanges, BDAG is poised for substantial market visibility. The initiative has already amassed over $202.5 million in its presale phase, with early participants experiencing a 2380% return on their initial commitment—a testament to its potential. Unlike many cryptos that diminish post-launch, BDAG is crafted for practical application, featuring rapid, scalable transactions that position it as a preferred Layer 1 blockchain. Analysts predict a potential $1 price target for the BDAG coin in 2025, a dramatic increase from its current Batch 27 price of just $0.0248. With rising demand, imminent listings, and increasing momentum, BDAG stands out as a prudent choice in the crypto sphere right now. 2. Arbitrum (ARB): Enhancing Ethereum’s DeFi Capabilities Arbitrum (ARB) boosts Ethereum’s performance by offering a more rapid and cost-effective Layer 2 solution. By implementing optimistic rollups, it handles transactions off-chain before finalizing them on Ethereum, greatly reducing congestion and fees. This has led to its adoption by prominent DeFi platforms, enhancing their scalability smoothly. ARB is presently priced at $0.42, indicating consistent market activity. With ongoing enhancements to Ethereum and growing interest from institutions, this most popular crypto is poised for sustained growth and is becoming integral to decentralized finance. 3. Filecoin (FIL): Pioneering Decentralized Data Storage Filecoin (FIL) is transforming digital storage by offering a decentralized alternative to conventional cloud services. It enables users to offer unused storage space, thereby creating a secure and efficient marketplace for data storage and retrieval. This model reduces dependence on centralized entities, boosting privacy and accessibility. Currently, FIL’s price stands at $2.98, marking a 6.40% drop over the past day. Nevertheless, with increasing adoption of Web3 and rising demand for decentralized services, this most popular crypto is set to become a key player in future data storage solutions. 4. Hedera (HBAR): Streamlining Blockchain for Enterprises Hedera (HBAR) tackles the challenges of speed and scalability using its Hashgraph consensus mechanism, which allows for parallel transaction processing, thus enhancing speed and security. This capability has attracted major corporations like Google, IBM, and Boeing to adopt Hedera’s technology. As of March 6, 2025, HBAR’s trading price is approximately $0.249, down by 2.75% in the last 24 hours. With its strong performance and increasing corporate use, Hedera is establishing itself as one of the most popular cryptos in the blockchain industry. Final Thoughts on Most Popular Cryptos The crypto market is crowded, and standing out requires more than hype. Arbitrum is streamlining Ethereum’s efficiency, Filecoin is revolutionizing decentralized storage, and Hedera is integrating blockchain into large enterprises. Yet, BlockDAG leads the pack for compelling reasons: its growth trajectory is remarkable. Anticipated for a mainnet launch and slated for listing on 10 major exchanges, along with a presale already showing 2380% growth, BDAG is demonstrating substantial potential. With a price target of $1 from a current price of just $0.0248, BDAG is set to be the leading most popular crypto of the year!

Yakovenko argues that failing fast will do more for Solana than a slew of proposal approvals. Solana Governance Has To Prioritize Speed And Incisiveness Solana co-founder Anatoly Yakovenko has moved on from the community’s rejection of the Solana Improvement Document (SIMD)-0228. Yakovenko noted that despite the failed proposal, the speed of governance proceedings for Solana left an impressive mark. The SIMD-0228 sought to change Solana’s tokenomics by introducing a dynamic inflation model, moving away from the network’s fixed inflation schedule. While the proposal split the network over centralization fears and disadvantages to smaller validators, Yakovenko highlighted the silver lining in its rejection. Learning from the proposal, the Solana cofounder disclosed that the network’s governance must be “fast and decisive.” For Yakovenko, the quick resolution of the proposal frees up resources for the network to explore a better approach. “How fast the ecosystem iterates is a thousand times more important than making sure that every proposal passes,” said Yakovenko. Over 74% of validators participated in the vote with Yakovenko declaring support for the proposal. Big ecosystem players including VanEck supported the proposal amid speculation that Solana price will spike following the approval. Bulls Eye Upward Movement For SOL Price Despite the rejection of the proposal, bulls are still clinging to hope that SOL can go on a parabolic rally. The network has faced significant downward pressure in recent weeks, complicated by Alameda’s SOL unstaking . A steep drop in Solana DEX volume darkens the cloud for the future of the asset’s price. However, analysts are keeping their eyes on the potential repeat of a 2021 pattern that can send SOL price to $4,000. There is speculation that Solana is on course to surpass Ethereum’s market capitalization. Optimist are hinging their prediction on on-chain metrics and the soaring number of projects building on the network. In the short term, traders have their eyes on SOL to $200 before the end of March despite a looming death cross.

Every week, new projects emerge, promising the next big breakthrough in the space. For 2025, three coins are really standing out: Qubetics ($TICS), Cosmos (ATOM), and Ondo (ONDO). Each one is bringing something unique to the table, but which one should grab your attention this week? Well, keep reading to find out which one could be the best crypto to buy this week and why. The latest buzz in the crypto market has centered around Qubetics, especially with its presale reaching an impressive milestone. At the same time, Cosmos continues to prove itself as a heavy hitter in the blockchain world, providing scalability and interconnectivity that could potentially change how decentralized networks communicate. Ondo, on the other hand, is drawing interest for its focus on privacy and security in the DeFi sector. With all these exciting developments, it’s tough to pick just one—but that’s what this guide is for: helping make the best choice for this week’s best crypto to buy. Qubetics, however, might just be the project to watch. It’s tackling cross-border transactions like no other, helping businesses and individuals simplify international payments and financial transfers. With its unique features, it’s positioning itself to fill gaps that others have left wide open. Now, let’s dive into each of these projects and explore what makes them stand out in 2025. Qubetics ($TICS) – The New Era of Cross-Border Transactions Qubetics is shaking things up, and for a good reason. It’s in the 25th stage of its crypto presale , and the buzz around its potential is palpable. With over 499 million tokens sold to more than 23,000 holders, raising an impressive $15 million, $TICS is gaining traction. But what’s even more exciting is how Qubetics is positioning itself as the go-to crypto for easier cross-border transactions. This is especially important as the world becomes increasingly globalized, and businesses and individuals alike need to move money faster, cheaper, and more securely across borders. The way Qubetics approaches cross-border transactions is a game-changer. Traditional systems for transferring money across borders are often slow, expensive, and can be filled with hidden fees. With Qubetics, all of that changes. Thanks to the blockchain’s inherent transparency and security, businesses, professionals, and individuals can send and receive payments across borders with ease. Imagine not having to wait days for a wire transfer or dealing with sky-high fees just to move money between countries. With $TICS, these transactions become seamless, faster, and much more affordable. Qubetics Presale: Massive ROI Potential for Early Buyers Current $TICS token price: $0.1074 during presale Analysts predict a rise to $0.25 after presale, offering a 132% ROI If $TICS hits $1 post-presale, that’s an 830% ROI Predictions of $5 to $15 per token after mainnet launch, equating to up to 15,255% ROI Significant growth potential with the ongoing presale! Qubetics isn’t just another crypto—it’s a potential solution to one of the biggest pain points in finance today. As cross-border transactions continue to become more and more essential, Qubetics is positioning itself as the solution businesses and individuals have been waiting for. The ongoing presale is an exciting opportunity, and this could very well be the best crypto to buy this week for those looking for both growth and practicality in the crypto space. Cosmos (ATOM) – The Internet of Blockchains Cosmos is like the glue that holds the blockchain world together. While many projects are focused on building individual, isolated networks, Cosmos is taking a different approach. It’s creating an ecosystem where different blockchains can communicate and work together, which is a big deal in a space that often feels fragmented. By using the Cosmos SDK, developers can build their own blockchain while also tapping into the wider Cosmos ecosystem, making it easier for various decentralized networks to share data and value. What makes Cosmos stand out this week as one of the best cryptos to buy is its focus on scalability and interoperability. As more and more projects come online, the ability for these projects to talk to each other becomes increasingly important. Cosmos has set itself up to be the connector for these different chains, solving one of the biggest issues that’s been holding back blockchain adoption: communication between networks. This opens up a whole new world of possibilities for decentralized finance (DeFi), supply chain management, healthcare data sharing, and so much more. Since its launch, Cosmos has had its fair share of ups and downs, but with recent updates and a growing ecosystem, it’s showing signs of maturity. The Cosmos Hub, which is at the heart of the ecosystem, continues to see strong growth, and the network’s governance features have made it more decentralized and community-driven. In a world where transparency and security are paramount, Cosmos checks all the boxes. Ondo (ONDO) – Privacy Meets DeFi If privacy is your top priority, Ondo is the crypto project to pay attention to. In a world where data breaches and surveillance are on the rise, Ondo offers a refreshing focus on privacy and security. It’s designed to provide privacy features in the decentralized finance (DeFi) space, which has often been criticized for its lack of protection against bad actors. Ondo’s privacy features are built using advanced cryptographic techniques that ensure transactions are not only secure but anonymous. It’s the kind of solution that could make a massive difference for users who are concerned about the security of their financial data. But Ondo isn’t just about privacy—it’s about providing a seamless experience for users who want the benefits of DeFi without compromising on their privacy. While Ondo is still in its early stages, its unique approach to privacy and DeFi has generated interest from those who see the value in a more secure and private financial ecosystem. It’s the kind of project that could help bring more mainstream adoption to decentralized finance by addressing the concerns that many have about security and privacy. For anyone looking for a crypto with long-term potential, Ondo is definitely one to watch. Cross-Border Transactions and Why They Matter Cross-border transactions are more important now than ever before. Whether it’s businesses looking to expand internationally or individuals sending money to family overseas, the need for fast, secure, and low-cost transactions is undeniable. Traditional financial systems have struggled to meet these needs, often taking days to process payments and charging high fees along the way. This is where projects like Qubetics come in, offering a faster and cheaper alternative to traditional systems. With Qubetics, the focus is on making cross-border transactions as easy as possible. Through its use of blockchain technology, Qubetics eliminates many of the pain points associated with international payments. Transactions are faster, more secure, and much more cost-effective than with traditional systems. And with the ongoing presale, it’s clear that Qubetics is gaining traction in the crypto community. As the world becomes more interconnected, the importance of cross-border transactions will only continue to grow, and Qubetics is in a prime position to capitalize on this trend. Conclusion: In 2025, the best crypto to buy this week is one that addresses real-world problems, whether it’s cross-border payments, scalability, or privacy in DeFi. Qubetics, Cosmos, and Ondo are each doing something unique, but Qubetics stands out for its focus on cross-border transactions, which are essential in today’s globalized world.

Despite this price gain, the prominent altcoin remains in a downtrend as indicated by its 11.17% loss in the past week. However, prominent analytics platform Glassnode has discovered an important price level that could offer some short-term support. Related Reading: Ethereum Consolidates Since ‘The Big Dump’ – Local Trend Reversal Or Continuation? Investors Boost Accumulation By 300,000 ETH At This Price Region – What Could It Mean? In an X post on March 14, Glassnode provided an intriguing analysis of the ETH market highlighting a potential strong support level. Based on the Cost Basis Distribution (CBD) metric, these analysts believe ETH is likely to hit a major support zone at the $1,886 price level in the case of a further price decline. In the crypto market, CBD represents a crucial on-chain metric that tracks the price levels at which tokens were last sold or bought. When a significant number of coins is acquired within a specific price range, that zone often serves as a support or resistance level. According to Glassnode, Ethereum’s CBD data shows that investors’ supply at $1,886 has grown from 1.6 million ETH to 1.9 million ETH indicating the acquisition of an additional 300,000 ETH when price last reached this level. This development postulates that a significant portion of investors view $1,886 as a crucial price point and are likely to increase their holdings in this region to prevent any further decline thus creating a viable support zone. Glassnode notes that this postulation aligns with insights from its custom capitulation metric design to capture price capitulation events leveraging the use of weighted sell volumes and non-linear economic pain experienced by investors. However, it’s worth noting that the $1,886 price level can only offer short-term support suggesting a likely price capitulation in the presence of overwhelming selling pressure.

Ethereum Price Overview At the time of writing, Ethereum trades at $1,924 following a 5% gain on the last day as previously stated. Meanwhile, the market’s daily trading volume is down by 29.29% and valued at $12.91 billion. Interestingly, the Relative Strength Index metric suggests Ethereum could soon enter the oversold region and potentially experience a price reversal. However, ETH bulls are confronted with multiple resistance zones at $2,249, $2,539, and $2,829 if they are to pull off any significant rebound and halt the current downtrend. On the other hand, any decisive price fall below $1,886 could lead to lower levels Such as $1,650 and $1,132.

Amid this recovery, ADA, the native token of the Cardano blockchain, appears bullish and is poised for a significant rally in the coming days. Cardano (ADA) Technical Analysis and Upcoming Levels According to expert technical analysis, ADA has formed a bullish inverted head and shoulders pattern and is now on the verge of a breakout. Based on recent price momentum, if the asset breaches the pattern’s neckline and closes a four-hour candle above the $0.76 level, there is a strong possibility it could initially soar by 10% to reach $0.85 in the coming days. Source: Trading View However, amid this rally, ADA may face resistance from the 200 Exponential Moving Average (EMA), which currently indicates that the asset is in a downtrend. This bullish thesis will hold only if ADA breaches the $0.76 level, otherwise, the bullish outlook may fail. However, on a longer time frame, ADA appears to be consolidating within a tight range between $0.73 and $0.757 over the past five trading days and is now attempting to break out. If the asset breaches this consolidation and closes a daily candle above the $0.76 level, it could soar significantly by 50% to reach $1.15 in the coming days.

By leveraging zero-knowledge proof technology, Immutable X delivers instant, gas-free transactions, effectively addressing Ethereum’s scalability challenges. The platform has formed strategic partnerships with industry giants like GameStop and Tencent, solidifying its position within the NFT and gaming ecosystems. Currently trading at around $0.62, IMX boasts a market cap of $1.1 billion. If it were to reach a $45 billion market cap, its value would need to grow 32 times from its current price, making it an attractive option for investors seeking affordable crypto assets. Both Lightchain AI and Immutable showcase cutting-edge innovation in the blocchain sector, offering exciting opportunities for those exploring emerging cryptocurrencies. Why Lightchain AI Stands Out in the $45 Billion Market Cap ​Lightchain AI distinguishes itself in the rapidly evolving blockchain and artificial intelligence (AI) sectors through several groundbreaking innovations.

Calacanis, an early investor in Bitcoin-related companies like online trading platform Robinhood and Bitcoin startup Keza , said, “All technology gets replaced over time… and Bitcoin will be no different.” Opportunity presents for Bitcoin layer-2 projects Founders and executives of Bitcoin-related companies were quick to push back, arguing that Bitcoin will not be replaced, though there’s still room for a dominant layer-2 protocol to emerge on top of the Bitcoin network. Source: Pierre Rochard Swan Bitcoin co-founder Brady Swenson said , “Winning protocols don’t get replaced; they are built upon.” “Bitcoin will never be replaced as a protocol for value transfer. The race is still on for the winning second layer protocol,” Swenson said. The other co-founder of Swan Bitcoin, Cory Klippsten, said , “Bitcoin is a technological revolution changing all industries, not following the adoption curve of a single technology like an iPad.” Source: Jason Lowery Echoing a similar sentiment, Lightspark CEO David Markus said , “What it lacks in functionality can be built on L2s.” “Trying to build a better Bitcoin is a fool’s errand.” Meanwhile, ShapeShift CEO Eric Voorhees said Bitcoin’s limitations can be solved “on other chains.” The bigger Bitcoin grows, the “less likely” it is to be replaced Many in the industry have emphasized the importance of layer-2s for Bitcoin , as they provide use cases that the Bitcoin network cannot support, such as deploying smart contracts. However, Muneeb Ali, co-founder of Stacks, recently told Cointelegraph that more than two-thirds of existing Bitcoin layer-2 projects will not exist within three years as their initial excitement will fade. Source: Gastón Silva Bitcoin advocate Wayne Vaughan said people wrongly assume Bitcoin is easily replaceable because they see it as just an asset, application, or platform. “I think of Bitcoin as a network. The larger the network gets, the less likely it is for something else to replace it,” Vaughan said in a March 15 X post. Related: Strategy’s Bitcoin stash still up over $7B despite market downturn Strive Funds CEO Matt Cole said , “There will not be a “better” Bitcoin.” “I do think we will get occasional alt seasons of ever diminishing strength that will continue to make insiders money. Most people will end up with less Bitcoin by going to that casino,” Cole said. This is not the first time that Calacanis’ comments have caused debate in the crypto industry. In June 2020, Calacanis said that nearly all of the crypto projects around the world are under the control of “unqualified idiots” or “grifters” with below-average skills.

The broader crypto market remains under heavy bearish control, and ETH has lost over 57% of its value, making it increasingly difficult for bulls to stage a recovery. Related Reading: Ethereum Consolidates Since ‘The Big Dump’ – Local Trend Reversal Or Continuation? With Ethereum now below a multi-year support level, this zone could flip into strong resistance, further complicating any potential rebound. The market is in a highly volatile phase, and traders are watching closely for signs of strength or further downside risks. On-chain data highlights two key price levels for Ethereum’s immediate trajectory. $1,870 currently serves as its critical support; meanwhile, $2,050 is now its most challenging resistance, acting as a major barrier that ETH must reclaim to confirm a trend reversal. For now, Ethereum remains vulnerable, with uncertainty driving price action. If bulls fail to defend current support, ETH could see further declines, but a successful reclaim of resistance could spark renewed confidence in the market. The next few days will be crucial in determining ETH’s short-term direction. Ethereum Faces Critical Test As Bulls Struggle To Reclaim $2,000 Ethereum is at a crucial turning point, trading near its lowest level since October 2023 as bears maintain control. After weeks of selling pressure and uncertainty, bulls must reclaim the $2,000 mark as soon as possible to prevent further downside and restore market confidence. Related Reading: Solana Forms Classic Cup-And-Handle Pattern – Analyst Predicts A Breakout To $3,800 The broader macroeconomic landscape remains uncertain, with trade war fears and global financial instability weighing heavily on both crypto and US stock markets. These factors have set the stage for a potential deeper correction, leaving investors on edge. However, some analysts believe a market recovery is still possible in the coming months, particularly if Ethereum can regain key resistance levels. Top analyst Ali Martinez recently shared on-chain metrics, identifying $1,870 as Ethereum’s strongest support level. This means that if ETH breaks below this zone, a further decline could be imminent. On the upside, $2,050 is now Ethereum’s most challenging resistance, acting as a crucial barrier that bulls must overcome. If Ethereum successfully reclaims $2,050, it will signal a strong trend reversal, potentially setting the stage for a powerful recovery rally. The next few trading sessions will be critical, as ETH must either hold its ground or risk further downside, with investors closely monitoring price action. ETH Bulls Must Hold Above $1,900 Ethereum is currently trading at $1,920, following days of consolidation below the crucial $2,000 level. Despite attempts to push higher, bulls have struggled to reclaim lost ground, leaving ETH in a vulnerable position. To confirm a recovery, ETH must break above the $2,000 mark and push beyond the 4-hour 200-moving average (MA) and exponential moving average (EMA) around $2,400. A successful reclaim of these levels would signal renewed buying momentum, potentially setting the stage for a strong rally toward higher resistance zones. However, if Ethereum fails to reclaim these levels, selling pressure could intensify, driving ETH toward lower demand zones around $1,750. A breakdown below this level would put even more pressure on bulls, potentially leading to further downside and extended bearish sentiment.

A recent survey by Patrick Bet-David showed this shift, showing that 43.8% of respondents believe Ripple has the best long-term tech, while Bitcoin only received 35% of the vote. According to social media, Bitcoin investors are feeling frustrated and confused by the growing excitement surrounding the XRP community. Eric Yakes, author and Managing Partner at EpochVC, expressed his thoughts on the situation , explaining that Ripple’s long-standing presence in the market has sparked interest. “Ripple has been around since 2012, and the question remains: How has it been used? What’s been done with it?” Yakes said. While Ripple’s network initially aimed to facilitate remittance payments and serve as a banking settlement system, its focus has shifted toward creating a Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC), a direction Yakes opposes. “Its best case scenario is that it’s a CBDC and its XRP token is not going to be used for that. There isn’t value that’s going to accrue to that token, so if you’re thinking that, it’s never going to win,” he said. Despite concerns over its past marketing tactics, Ripple’s ability to generate significant value through a large pre-mine and effective marketing campaigns has caught the attention of investors. Ripple’s involvement in facilitating payments through RippleNet currently sees $7 billion in payments processed annually, even amid an ongoing lawsuit with the SEC. This success has created a narrative that’s helping XRP gain traction, leaving Bitcoin investors questioning why Ripple’s project is thriving in the face of adversity.",News|Bitcoin|Crypto news|Ripple (XRP),EN,0,0,XRP|BTC|BUSINESS|REGULATION|FIAT,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-03-16 04:21:03

He emphasized the expected continuation of an Elliott Wave pattern unfolding since 2023. The post suggests that XRP may be on the verge of reaching Wave 3 in this cycle, signaling further gains. In the tweet, Dark Defender stated : “Hi all, #XRP is preparing to appreciate more against ETH. We have followed our Wave pattern since 2023 and are expected to hit Wave 3. We will be discussing XRP Dominance this year.” Hi all, #XRP is preparing to appreciate more against #ETH . We have followed our Wave pattern since 2023 and are expected to hit Wave 3.

The earlier chart shows a period of consolidation and the formation of a resistance line that persisted for four years. The latest update highlights that XRP has already broken past this resistance and is progressing toward its next target levels. The anticipated Wave 3 is positioned at a Fibonacci extension level, suggesting a strong upward movement. According to data from CoinMarketCap, XRP is currently trading at $2.35, witnessing a 4.83% price increase in the last 24 hours. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Market Sentiment and XRP’s Potential Dominance An X user, NPcoin, commented on the analysis, stating confidence in XRP’s future dominance. They mentioned that as Bitcoin weakens, XRP could gain more institutional and retail recognition due to increasing adoption. Dark Defender’s chart analysis reflects a growing sentiment among some traders that XRP could see significant gains relative to Ethereum. The structure suggests that, after Wave 3, a corrective Wave 4 could occur before a final Wave 5 push. These projections align with historical market cycles and technical patterns used by Elliott Wave theorists. XRP’s Position in the Broader Market The post also hinted at a broader discussion on XRP’s dominance in the market. XRP’s market positioning has long been debated, particularly regarding its role in institutional finance and potential use in global payment systems . As regulatory clarity around XRP improves, traders speculate on its long-term standing relative to other major cryptocurrencies. As noted in the charts, Dark Defender’s analysis does not constitute financial advice. However, it highlights the ongoing technical and market sentiment shifts that could influence XRP’s trajectory against Ethereum.

This decline came after a brief period of excitement when the coin surged by 20% to $1.70 but later corrected. Despite this setback, new developments, such as the launch of Pi domains, have sparked renewed interest, leading many to believe that PiI could once again push above $2 in the near future. The support level for Pi is currently at $1.20. If the price drops below this level, it could signal further declines. On the other hand, the resistance level is around $1.90. A breakout above this point could trigger bullish momentum, with $3 being the next major target. What Went Wrong On Pi Day? Pi Network’s much-anticipated Pi Day celebrations failed to meet expectations, resulting in a significant sell-off. One of the main reasons behind this was the KYC purge, where millions of unverified accounts lost their Pi tokens, leading to frustration and panic selling among the community. Another contributing factor is the market constraints, as Pi Network still operates within a closed-loop economy without open blockchain access and major exchange listings, limiting its growth potential. New Developments Stir Excitement Despite the challenges, Pi Network remains optimistic about its future. The recent launch of domain bidding with Pi Coins has sparked renewed excitement, offering community members the chance to secure unique domain names in the decentralized space. This development is seen as a potential game-changer for Web3. Looking ahead, the future of Pi Network will depend on its ability to develop stronger utility, gain real-world adoption, and deliver a clear, actionable roadmap.

This hope rose after stocks and crypto prices surged on Friday, with the top three US indices like the Dow Jones, Nasdaq 100, and S&P 500 rising by over 1.5%. The challenge, however, is that the crypto fear and greed index remains in the fear zone of 21. Also, there are signs that Bitcoin has remained stubbornly below the key resistance level at $85,000. Let’s explore some of the top movers in crypto like PancakeSwap (CAKE), Mantle (MNT), Mantra (OM), Ripple (XRP), and Hedera Hashgraph (HBAR). Crypto market today | Source: CoinMarketCap CAKE rises as PancakeSwap volume jumps The CAKE price rose by over 10% in the last 24 hours, moving from this week’s low of 1.3953 to a high of 1.8500. This rebound happened as third-party data showed that it was the most active decentralized exchange (DEX) in the BSC Chain . It handled about $1.15 billion in the last 24 hours, bringing the weekly total to $7.9 billion. Its volume was much higher than other DEX networks in the BSC network like THENA, Dodo, and Pendle. Mantle price rises as investors buy the dip The Mantle (MNT) coin price has risen in the past few days. It jumped from a low of $0.6610 on March 9 to a high of $0.80, its highest level since February 25. There was no clear catalyst for the Mantle price rise, meaning that it happened as investors bought the dip. Mantle is gearing to a relatively strong year as the developers focus on key six parts, including the enhanced index fund, Mantle Banking, MantleX, mETH protocol, and ignition FBTC. Mantra price stabilizes Mantra was one of the best-performing coins in the last few years as it moved from below zero to almost $10 this year. It has retreated by almost 30% from its highest level this year. Mantra price was trading at $6.56 on Sunday as it attempted to bounce back and retest its all-time high. The key catalyst for the OM price is the upcoming OM GenDrop that will reward core members of the community. As part of this airdrop, the network has worked to eliminate potential accounts that fraudulently registered for the airdrop. Technicals suggest that the Mantra price will likely resume the uptrend and retest its all-time high later this year. Meanwhile, XRP and HBAR prices were some of the top laggards in the crypto market today as they dropped by about 2% on Sunday. Other top laggards were coins like Story (IP), Kaspa, AAVE, and Stellar. These losses were relatively small as they averaged less than 2%. Federal Reserve decision and tariff news The next catalyst for these crypto prices will be Donald Trump’s actions, who has embarked on a strategy to push the US into a self-inflicted recession . He has added tariffs on imported goods from countries like China, Canada, and Mexico. These tariffs have led to a stock market crash , impacting other assets like cryptocurrencies. On the positive side, there are signs that these assets have now priced in the tariffs, which explains why the key indices like the Dow Jones and Nasdaq 100 rose. The upcoming Federal Reserve interest rate decision is the other important crypto catalyst. Bitcoin and other coins will likely do well if the central bank embraces a more dovish tone in this meeting. Odds are that it will signal that it will deliver more rate cuts later this year if the US sinks into a recession.

Here’s the Significance,https://timestabloid.com/xrp-final-countdown-has-started-heres-the-significance/,"Market analyst Steph has indicated that the final countdown for a potential XRP price reversal is underway. In a recent update on X, he outlined key indicators suggesting that XRP could soon break to the upside after a prolonged period of bearish movement. His analysis focused on historical price trends, the behavior of exponential moving average (EMA) ribbons, and the likelihood of a short squeeze contributing to a rally. THE FINAL COUNTDOWN HAS STARTED FOR #XRP .. pic.twitter.com/ndaIDpb995 — STEPH IS CRYPTO (@Steph_iscrypto) March 12, 2025 EMA Ribbon Analysis and Market Trend Steph’s assessment emphasized the importance of EMA ribbons in identifying shifts in market momentum. These ribbons, which traders use to determine whether an asset is in a bullish or bearish phase, currently indicate that XRP remains in a bearish state. The token has traded below the EMA ribbons for 37 days, a pattern that has historically preceded strong price reversals. He pointed out that in October 2024, XRP remained below the EMA ribbons for 35 days before experiencing a sharp rally. The cryptocurrency surged from approximately $0.50 to over $3 before entering its current correction phase. With XRP now surpassing the duration of its previous bearish stretch, Steph suggested that a breakout could be imminent. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Historical Trends Supporting a Reversal Drawing comparisons to previous market cycles, Steph noted that XRP has historically seen significant price increases after extended periods below the EMA ribbons. He referenced two notable cases: the first In April 2024, when XRP remained under the ribbons for 90 days before rallying by 43%, and the second in August 2023, when the token stayed in bearish territory for 64 days before rising 47%. Given these past trends, Steph proposed three possible scenarios. The worst-case scenario would see XRP spending 90 days below the EMA ribbons before reversing. A moderate case would align with the 64-day trend. However, he highlighted that XRP has rarely remained below the ribbons for just over 36 days, and with 37 days already elapsed, the likelihood of a breakout soon is increasing. Key Price Level for Confirmation Steph identified a critical price level that could signal the start of a rally. According to him, if XRP secures a daily close above $2.35, it could confirm a bullish breakout. He projected that this would likely lead to a minimum price increase of around 40%. However, he suggested that the rally could extend beyond this estimate, depending on market conditions. Short Squeeze Potential Could Accelerate Price Surge Another factor that could contribute to an XRP breakout is the high number of traders shorting the asset. Steph pointed out that funding rates remain extremely negative, meaning many traders are betting on further declines. “This creates a lot of liquidity above us with very little below. Price typically targets the highest liquidity, so a massive short squeeze is likely to occur soon,” he explained. A short squeeze occurs when traders betting against the asset are forced to buy back their positions, accelerating upward momentum. If this scenario unfolds, it could significantly amplify any price recovery that XRP experiences. Steph’s analysis suggests that XRP could be nearing the end of its bearish phase, with historical patterns, technical indicators, and liquidity conditions all pointing toward a potential breakout. While the exact timeline remains uncertain, he emphasized that XRP’s recent trading behavior closely mirrors past situations that led to major price rallies. Traders will now be watching key resistance levels, particularly $2.35 , for confirmation of a reversal. Disclaimer : This content is meant to inform and should not be considered financial advice.

Arctic Pablo Coin’s Unique Burn Mechanism: Boosting Scarcity & Value One of the standout features of Arctic Pablo Coin ($APC) is its strategic token burn mechanism, designed to increase scarcity and enhance long-term value. Unlike many meme coins that rely solely on hype, Arctic Pablo Coin ensures that unsold tokens are permanently removed from circulation. Every week during the presale, unsold tokens are eliminated, making the remaining supply more valuable. But it doesn’t stop there—once the presale ends, all leftover tokens will also be burned, fostering a deflationary ecosystem.

By continuously reducing supply while demand rises, Arctic Pablo Coin is in the middle of Top New Meme Coins for Exponential Returns .

Shiba Inu (SHIB): A Leading Powerhouse in the Meme Coin Market Shiba Inu (SHIB), a leading meme coin, continues to dominate the cryptocurrency market, currently priced at $0.00001298. Despite the inherent volatility of meme coins, SHIB maintains strong momentum, evidenced by its impressive 24-hour trading volume of $283.45 million. The token’s enduring popularity is fueled by a dedicated community and ongoing developments within the Shiba Inu ecosystem, including initiatives like ShibaSwap, NFT projects, and potential layer-2 scaling solutions. These efforts signal a broader vision beyond its meme coin origins, fostering investor optimism. As the crypto market evolves, SHIB remains a key player, blending community enthusiasm with strategic innovation. Book of Meme (BOME): Rising Star in the Meme Coin Arena The Book of Meme (BOME) token is rapidly gaining momentum in the cryptocurrency space, captivating investors and enthusiasts alike. Currently priced at $0.00161, BOME boasts a robust 24-hour trading volume of $55.47 million, underscoring its growing popularity.

This move has caught the attention of investors in the crypto market. Now, there have been talks surrounding the movement of XYZ. Could this be the next breakthrough in the crypto market? The developments over the next few weeks remain to be seen. XYZ’s Rise to Glory: The Meme Coin Fighter Punching Through the Crypto Arena XYZ is gradually becoming the next heavyweight champion in the meme coin industry. The token was recently crowned as the best NEW Meme Project because it merges the energetic world of sports with the meme culture. This is one of the reasons why it has seen millions of fans joining its community as they want to be part of something big. In every great story, there is always a hero. The hero might not be the strongest or the biggest, but he is the one who keeps pushing forward even when the going gets tough. The hero in this story is XYZepe, who is the masked fighter, a big believer, and the relentless holder of the $XYZ token. The mission of this fighter is to take XYZVerse to the top of CoinMarketCap while writing the name of XYZ in the crypto history books. The CMC community is also showing support for this hero, with about 95% predicting a rise in the price of $XYZ. However, all great warriors do not get victory easily as they have to fight hard to be the winner. In the case of $XYZ, it has already passed through 11 of its 15 presale stages, as its community has helped prepare an environment for the rise of the asset after the stages. While still undervalued at $0.003333, $XYZ is a token that traders can bet on for the future. By the end of the presale, experts have set a $0.1 target for the token. The token still needs to fight, but it has a nice path to glory. Champions Get Rewarded In XYZVerse, the community are the ones that dictate the plays. Investors are not just spectators, as they are rewarded with airdropped XYZ tokens for their dedication to the project. This shows that it is a game, and only the most dedicated players win. The Road to Victory $XYZ is built for a championship run due to its solid tokenomics, listings on CEX and DEX, and a periodic token burn. This shows that every play will help the project to strengthen its price and bring together a community of investors that believe in the project. XYZepe is fighting for glory, Are you ready to join the ring? Sei: The Lightning-Fast Blockchain Revolutionizing Trading Sei has been getting a lot of attention in the crypto market due to its build as a Blockchain design just for trading. The network was built to help exchanges, handling a large amount of orders every second, with its transaction finality of just about 380 milliseconds. The blockchain is also enjoying institutional support, something that makes it different from platforms like Solana and Ethereum. While most networks want to be everything at once, Sei just wants to make trading better for everybody in the crypto market. While the market remains volatile, Sei stands out with its focus on speed and security for traders. According to analysts, if Sei reaches its price target, it could see a 323% rise in the next five years. This prediction makes it a better investment opportunity for investors scouting for the best projects in the crypto market. As decentralized exchanges continue to gain popularity, platforms like Sei could lead the way. Compared to older tokens, the approach of the project could give Sei what it needs to excel in the current market cycle. Conclusion While SEI and some other tokens have a bright future, XYZ has the better outlook for the future due to its blend of sports and meme culture. Those attributes will position the token to take advantage of the current bull market.

41737247,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=691650,1742103000,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/41737247.jpeg,Ethereum (ETH) and Solana Are Slowing Down—FXGuys Could Be the Next Crypto Superstar,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/ethereum-eth-and-solana-are-slowing-down-fxguys-could-be-the-next-crypto-superstar/,"The current bearish market has caused giants like Ethereum (ETH) and Solana (SOL) to slow down quite significantly. Now, as both the ETH and SOL prices fall, Ethereum and Solana investors are pivoting to a new project. This new project is called FXGuys ($FXG), and it brings a great new crypto trading platform to the market. With it, it also brings massive growth potential, which is why experts see it as the next crypto superstar! >>>JOIN FXGUYS HERE The ETH Price Is Still Falling Even as Ethereum Whales Move Ethereum has become notorious in the past year because of its lousy price action. 2024 was not a great year for ETH, and with the current market downturn, 2025 isn’t either. Right now, the ETH price is at $2,210, down by over 18% in the past month. Sentiment surrounding Ethereum has been worsening for months now, and experts believe that this will continue. This is especially so when considering recent ETH developments. Namely, in the last 48 hours, Ethereum whales bought up 1.10 million ETH tokens . This should have helped the ETH price to finally move up, but it didn’t. Experts say that this is because ETH is so weak right now that not even Ethereum whales can help. With this in mind, experts are confident that the ETH price will decrease even more, especially if the current market sentiment persists. Thus, they say that Ethereum’s price can reach below $2,000 very soon. The SOL Price Is Also Falling Despite Positive Developments On March 2, 2025, Donald Trump announced that SOL would be a part of the U.S. Crypto Reserve. This caused quite a stir in the Solana community and pushed the SOL price to nearly $180. However, the SOL price wasn’t able to keep this level for more than a few hours, and it went down almost immediately after. Now, Solana’s price is at $144, down by over 25% in the past month. The fact that Solana couldn’t sustain the bullish momentum it got from Trump’s announcement shows just how weak SOL is at the moment. Solana’s weakness can also be seen through some other recent developments. Namely, the total number of Solana addresses hit a new ATH recently, now at 2.07 billion addresses. However, this still didn’t prompt SOL’s price to rise, which is worrying. Thus, because of Solana’s weak momentum, experts believe that SOL’s price will drop even more soon. They say that the SOL price could reach around $100 if the current bearish sentiment persists, which would be a 30% drop from its current price. FXGuys Is the New Crypto Trading Platform That Will Push ETH and SOL Into the Background While ETH and SOL struggle, $FXG has been rising in value, jumping from Stage 2 to Stage 3 of its public presale even during the current market downturn. As such, FXGuys has shown much better strength than both Ethereum and Solana, and it hasn’t even launched yet. The reason why FXGuys’ momentum is so strong right now is because of the utility it offers. Namely, it brings a great new crypto trading platform to the market, one that will be useful to people no matter the market conditions. Also, this new crypto trading platform offers much better perks and terms than all existing ones, which adds even more to its appeal. For one, this new crypto trading platform provides traders with same-day payouts. Thus, with it, FXGuys traders will be able to receive their money within 24 hours of requesting it. Also, all FXGuys users will get unrestricted withdrawals, which is yet another perk they can’t find anywhere else. FXGuys also recently launched a free trial for its BETA platform, allowing current and potential investors to try it out risk-free before deciding whether to invest. This free trial is a great way to check out how this new crypto trading platform works, and it’s already brought thousands of investors to the FX Guys presale. But regular traders aren’t the only ones who can use this new crypto trading platform, as funded traders can, too. With FXGuys, funded traders will get access to up to $500,000 in funds and get a generous 80/20 profit split. So, just one FXGuys-funded account can bring them hundreds of thousands in profits. And if all this wasn’t enough, this new crypto trading platform also offers great rewards. First, there’s the FXGuys Trade2Earn program. With it, traders will earn $FXG tokens with every trade they take. Next, there’s the FX Guys staking program. This allows users to stake their $FXG tokens and get a share of the FXGuys trading volume and fees in return! >>>JOIN FXGUYS HERE Invest in the Market’s Next Crypto Superstar Early: Join the $FXG Public Presale Now! The market’s next crypto superstar is currently in Stage 3 of its public presale, selling for $0.05 per token. This means that, right now, you can join the $FXG wave early and catch all the gains it makes once it launches. And with the utility that this new crypto trading platform offers, the gains are set to be life-changing. Namely, as soon as $FXG launches at $0.10, its first-ever rally will begin, meaning that presale investors will catch it from the beginning. Experts’ primary target for $FXG is a 100x price rise, which they expect $FXG to reach by Q2 of 2025. However, this is just the start for $FXG, as experts see it rising even more in value in the coming months and weeks!

Chart Patterns Show What’s Coming Next",https://www.newsbtc.com/news/bitcoin/bitcoin-price-above-100000-again-chart-patterns-show-whats-coming-next/,"Crypto analyst Madden has raised the possibility of the Bitcoin price rallying above $100,000 again, providing a bullish outlook for the flagship crypto. His analysis showed what is coming next for BTC and how it could reach this psychological price level. Related Reading: 200 Million XRP On The Move—Is Ripple Preparing For A Big Play? Bitcoin Price Eyes Rally Above $100,000 With Potential Bullish Reversal In a TradingView post, Madden indicated that the Bitcoin price was eyeing a rally above $100,000 with a reversal looking likely. His accompanying chart showed that $91,700, $102,700, and $109,356 are potential price targets which BTC could hit as it reverses to the upside. A rally to $109,356 would mark a new all-time high (ATH) for the flagship crypto. The crypto analyst alluded to some charts with important levels and relevant patterns to determine if the reversal is confirmed for the Bitcoin price. On the daily chart, he highlighted a Deep-Crab harmonic and Wolfe wave pattern to identify the reversal points. The Deep Cran pattern showed that BTC likely bottomed out when it touched $76,600, with the reversal now in play. Madden also alluded to the CME daily chart for the Bitcoin price. He noted that there is a daily retest of the 200-day moving average (MA) and that the CME gap between $77,000 and $80,000 has been filled, indicating there is no reason for BTC to drop that low again. Meanwhile, the crypto analyst added that BTC is currently above the 2022 and 2024 top support line. BTC Roadmap Moving Forward As part of his analysis, Madden also provided a roadmap and future outlook for the Bitcoin price. His accompanying chart showed that the flagship crypto could top at around $125,000 in this market cycle. Based on the chart, BTC will reach this price target by year end. Crypto expert Willy Woo also once suggested that Bitcoin could reach this target, as he described it as conservative. The chart also showed that the Bitcoin price could enter into a bear market by 2026, dropping from the projected peak of $125,000 to as low as $40,000. This price drop to $40,000 could happen before 2026 ends. In the meantime, the bullish reversal for the Bitcoin price is the major focus of market participants. Crypto analyst Ali Martinez stated that BTC is breaking out. He added that the target is $90,000 as long as the $84,000 support holds. Crypto whales are already positioning themselves for the potential reversal of the Bitcoin price to $90,000. Martinez revealed that these whales have bought over 20,000 BTC in the last 48 hours.

This Altcoin Might Just Be the One to Watch for Major Gains!",https://timestabloid.com/xrp-has-been-stagnant-for-years-but-whats-fueling-hopes/,"XRP has been among the most talked-about cryptocurrencies for years but has never been able to rid itself of its long-term price lethargy. Currently, as speculation increases that XRP can reach as high as $75, traders are waiting anxiously for key market events that can spur it into action. In the meantime, there is another project gaining momentum—Remittix (RTX). As XRP is being promoted for institutions’ adoption, RTX is positioning itself as crypto-to-fiat payment for businesses and individuals. With the two tokens competing for domination of the payment industry globally, investors are eager to learn about which of the two has the potential to yield greater returns in 2025. Can XRP Finally Reach $75? XRP has appreciated by 4.69% in the recent past and has traded for $2.42. Despite registering this rise, the trade volume fell 15.36% to $4.63 billion and reflects some combination of buying and profit-taking. Its market cap stands at $140.99 billion and puts it in the list of the largest cryptocurrencies in the payment industry. XRP would require institution adoption and favorable regulatory outcomes to push XRP to $75. Ongoing legal cases against the SEC are also a high influence factor and if favorable would unleash gigantic inflows into XRP. If banks and financial institutions adopt XRP for large-scale international transactions, it would push the demand to induce gigantic price appreciation. But most of the investors are losing patience with XRP’s sluggish progress and are looking towards more recent blockchain-based payment systems like Remittix (RTX). Remittix (RTX): The New Challenger in Crypto Payments Whereas XRP is focusing on institutions, Remittix (RTX) targets retail users, freelancers, and businesses searching for rapid crypto-to-fiat settlements. Priced at $0.0734, RTX has raised in excess of $13.9 million and sold 520 million tokens as of now, indicating strong early demand. RTX PayFi model facilitates exchange of digital currencies into fiat within seconds without any bank lag and concealed fees. It makes Remittix (RTX) a more convenient-to-use financial tool for individuals and businesses with the need for rapid borderless transactions. A South American freelancer with customers in Europe—instead of waiting for days for the bank transfer—can be using RTX to receive payment directly in their hands immediately with minimal fees. This real-world usage case makes RTX as good of an alternative as XRP has until now with more generalized institutional adoption pending. Could RTX Deliver Bigger Gains Than XRP? While the long-term growth potential of XRP is still in place, RTX’s high adoption rate can allow it to gain higher percentage returns. Unlike XRP, which still has regulatory challenges to solve, RTX is already operational as a real-world financial solution. For growth-oriented investors looking for higher-growth investments, there is a direct alternative for crypto payment in RTX and hence it may be a better bet than XRP. With crypto adoption increasing even more in the future, RTX can benefit from increased usage in freelancing, cross-border payment, and e-commerce. Remittix is likely to continue growing at the same rate. According to experts, it can surpass XRP growth and give more return on investment to initial investors. Invest in the Future of Digital Payments with Remittix (RTX) Where XRP is looking to hit $75, Remittix (RTX) is positioning itself as the new best thing in the blockchain payment sector. With greater adoption of RTX on the rise, investors are snapping up positions as it approaches the conclusion of its presale phase. Whereas XRP’s rise to $75 is theoretical, Remittix (RTX) is making blockchain transactions practical and workable here and now. With investors searching for high growth potential, RTX is becoming the number one XRP alternative in the financial industry. In search of crypto investing with practical uses? Go to Remittix presale and learn about the potential of RTX as the future of crypto payments.

In a recent post , Uphold wrote “Ripple has received regulatory approval in Dubai, becoming the first licensed blockchain payments provider in the Dubai International Financial Centre (DIFC).” This development marks a significant milestone for Ripple and strengthens Dubai’s position as a global center for cryptocurrency innovation. Here’s your #XRP Report for the week: Ripple Becomes First Licensed Blockchain Payments Provider in Dubai #Ripple has received regulatory approval in Dubai, becoming the first licensed blockchain payments provider in the Dubai International Financial Centre (DIFC).… pic.twitter.com/JLjlW2bp5t — Uphold (@UpholdInc) March 15, 2025 The licensing allows Ripple to enhance cross-border payment services across the United Arab Emirates (UAE). Uphold noted that Ripple estimates “20% of its clients are based in the Middle East,” highlighting the region’s importance to the company’s expansion plans. Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse commented on Dubai’s regulatory environment, “Thanks to its early leadership in creating a supportive environment for tech and crypto innovation, the UAE is exceptionally well-placed to benefit.” Dubai has been fostering blockchain innovation, attracting major companies seeking regulatory clarity. Ripple’s approval within the DIFC is expected to support the company’s growth in the region while reinforcing Dubai’s role as a key jurisdiction for digital assets. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 SEC Reconsidering XRP’s Regulatory Classification Uphold also reported that the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is reviewing whether XRP should be classified as a commodity . According to the update, this reconsideration is “part of ongoing settlement discussions with Ripple.” The potential shift in XRP’s classification has drawn attention, as it could impact the regulatory framework surrounding the digital asset. The comparison between XRP and Ethereum’s regulatory treatment has also resurfaced. Uphold highlighted that Ripple’s Chief Technology Officer, David Schwartz, challenged the equivalency between the two assets . Schwartz argued that “ETH was ‘privately sold by an issuer prior to any ledger or blockchain existing,’” distinguishing its history from that of XRP. This statement underscores the ongoing debate over how digital assets should be classified under U.S. securities laws. While discussions regarding XRP’s status continue, the possibility of a regulatory shift has raised questions about the outcome of Ripple’s legal battle with the SEC. Uphold asked the question, “Could this shift in XRP’s classification mark a turning point in the Ripple case?” Implications for the Crypto Market Ripple’s regulatory approval in Dubai strengthens its ability to serve clients in the Middle East while reinforcing the city’s status as a global crypto hub. The SEC’s review of XRP’s classification introduces new uncertainty into Ripple’s legal dispute, but it also suggests that regulatory authorities may be reassessing their approach to digital assets. As developments unfold, the cryptocurrency industry will closely watch how these regulatory changes affect Ripple’s operations and the broader market.

41739675,https://timestabloid.com/?p=60428,1742104701,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/67/default.png,XRP Price Analysis: XRP Needs to Close Above This Level for Bullish Continuation,https://timestabloid.com/xrp-price-analysis-xrp-needs-to-close-above-this-level-for-bullish-continuation/,"Crypto analyst EGRAG CRYPTO recently shared an optimistic outlook on XRP’s price movement, emphasizing the need for a decisive breakout above key resistance levels. In a recent tweet, EGRAG CRYPTO stated, “XRP – No More Tapping Down,” suggesting it must move beyond its repeated tests of lower support levels and establish a stronger upward trajectory. He highlighted the $3.00 price point as a crucial milestone, asserting, “#XRP needs to close above $3.00 for bullish continuation.” This statement underlines the significance of this resistance level as a gateway to further gains. If XRP manages to break and sustain a price above this mark, it could signal a bullish trend. #XRP – No More Tapping Down #XRP needs to close above $3.00 for #bullish continuation . We can't keep tapping the lower boundaries anymore! The more times we knock on that door, the greater the chance it will open . It’s time for #XRP to start trending upward! … pic.twitter.com/q7ALHVPY8S — EGRAG CRYPTO (@egragcrypto) March 14, 2025 Key Support and Resistance Levels to Watch EGRAG CRYPTO also pointed out the repeated testing of support levels, remarking, “We can’t keep tapping the lower boundaries anymore! The more times we knock on that door, the greater the chance it will open.” This comment reflects a common technical analysis principle: when a support level is repeatedly tested without breaking lower, it strengthens the likelihood of an upward breakout. Another critical price target mentioned in the tweet is $2.65. He stated, “It’s time for #XRP to start trending upward! $2.65 is the first critical closure.” This suggests that XRP must first secure a close above $2.65 before it can build momentum toward the $3.00 mark. The $2.65 level, therefore, serves as a short-term resistance that traders and investors are closely watching. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Technical Chart and Future Price Potential The chart shared by EGRAG CRYPTO illustrates XRP’s price movements , highlighting key technical zones. The blue area represents a range where XRP consolidates, while the yellow trendlines indicate long-term resistance levels. Notably, the chart projects a possible upward move, reaching as high as $4.80 if resistance levels are breached successfully. EGRAG CRYPTO concluded the tweet with, “#XRPFamily Together We Rise.” This statement resonates with the XRP community , which remains engaged in discussions about XRP’s price potential and broader market dynamics. The overall sentiment in the post suggests that if XRP manages to close above the identified resistance levels, the market could see further bullish momentum in the coming weeks. Market Outlook and Next Steps for XRP As the cryptocurrency market remains volatile, traders will monitor XRP’s performance closely. The next few trading sessions will determine whether the asset can build enough momentum to close above these critical resistance levels and sustain an upward trend. If XRP closes above $2.65 and then $3.00, it could confirm a bullish continuation, increasing optimism among investors and traders.

Positioned as a decentralized lending platform offering genuine value, it stands apart from speculative assets. For investors focused on stable returns and sustained growth, MUTM is rapidly becoming the go-to choice. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Mutuum Finance simplifies decentralized lending and borrowing, enabling users to earn passive income or secure liquidity without relying on intermediaries. Built on smart contracts, the platform ensures transparent and direct control over one’s investments. In a move to solidify user confidence, the Mutuum Finance team is undergoing a Certik smart contract audit—one of the most trusted security assessments in the blockchain space. The results of this review will be made public, reflecting Mutuum’s dedication to a safe, transparent environment in preparation for broader market adoption. Currently priced at a mere $0.02 during Phase 3 of its presale, MUTM will launch at $0.06—providing early participants with a straightforward 200% return. Yet analysts predict even greater gains once the token is listed on exchanges, with an estimated 1,800% increase driven by rising demand, user adoption, and expanding use cases. In practical terms, a $1,000 investment at presale rates might grow to $18,000 in the short run. A Model Built for Long-Term Success Mutuum Finance offers more than just early gains. Its unique economic strategy fosters lasting growth and price stability, thanks to a built-in “buy-and-distribute” system. A portion of fees from lending activities is allocated toward purchasing MUTM tokens on the open market. These newly acquired tokens are then redistributed to mtToken stakers, creating ongoing buy pressure that supports steady price appreciation. mtTokens represent deposits made into Mutuum Finance lending pools. As lenders receive mtTokens in proportion to their contributions, these tokens automatically accrue interest. Over time, this allows users to earn passive income and redeem their mtTokens for more of the initial deposited asset. Rising Investor Interest and Rapid Presale Progress The presale has already brought in more than $3.35 million from over 5,700 holders—a testament to growing market enthusiasm. With more than 250 million tokens sold and the presale price slated to increase in the next phase, investors are acting quickly to avoid missing out on advantageous pricing. This steady momentum speaks to the platform’s credibility and highlights how Mutuum Finance’s real-world utility sets it apart from volatile or hype-driven coins. Additionally, Mutuum Finance plans to release a fully functional beta of its lending and borrowing platform alongside the token launch. Offering immediate utility from day one will likely attract a broader user base, fostering even greater demand for MUTM and reinforcing future growth prospects. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) merges tangible DeFi value with a well-crafted economic plan, backed by a community of engaged investors. Its strong short-term upside—paired with the potential for ongoing expansion—places it at the forefront for those seeking both immediate gains and lasting returns. With rising demand, a committed development team, and a transparent approach, MUTM stands out as one of the most promising cryptocurrencies in the market today.

Bitcoin (BTC) price recovered from a $76K low to reach $84K right ahead of the U.S. FOMC next week. Whereas, major-league altcoins also mimicked price gains. The global cryptocurrency market cap again embarked upon a trajectory towards the $3 trillion mark as the week comes to an end. Mentioned below are some of the top crypto market updates reported by CoinGape Media over the past week. Crypto Market: Bitcoin Advancements This Week The flagship crypto has witnessed significant developments over the past seven days, keeping investors optimistic despite price turbulence. Notably, global financial services firm Cantor Fitzgerald launched a $2 billion Bitcoin financing business, partnering with Anchorage Digital and Copper for secure institutional access. On the other hand, Cathie Wood’s Ark Invest expanded its Bitcoin holdings, accumulating 997 BTC worth $80 million via Coinbase this week. Also, despite the recent market turmoil, 95% of investors in the U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs continue to hold onto their holdings. As a result, market watchers continue weighing optimism over long-term price prospects. It’s also noteworthy that the Singapore Exchange (SGX) is planning to launch Bitcoin futures contracts shortly ahead. Moreover, Deutsche Boerse’s post-trade unit Clearstream plans to launch Bitcoin & Ethereum custody services by the end of this year. Mentioned above are the top crypto market updates orbiting Bitcoin over the past week. Are Prices Bracing For Macro Events? Meanwhile, the broader market shows a recovery-like trend ahead of the U.S. FOMC next week . Set to occur on March 19, the monetary policymaking decision remains much eyed by investors globally. Market-wide expectations of unchanged interest rates by the U.S. Fed prevail at the moment. Also, the latest U.S. CPI data indicated cooling inflation, offering some support to risk assets. In turn, traders and investors speculate whether a price recovery is possible after the turmoil caused by Donald Trump’s tariff saga. Global markets, including crypto, took severe heat previously, although recent price actions signal that a recovery and bull cycle continuation might be on the horizon.

On March 15, Toncoin ( TON ) OI — a metric tracking the total number of unsettled Toncoin derivative contracts such as options and futures — reached $169 million, representing a 67% increase from the previous day when the reports of Durov’s departure first surfaced, according to CoinGlass data.

Trading resource account Crypto Billion said in a March 15 X post that Toncoin is “showing signs of a potential long-term accumulation phase as it stabilizes near key support levels.” However, if this rally is short-lived , around $18.8 million in long positions could be liquidated if TON’s price falls back toward the $3 level it was trading at on March 14. Toncoin open interest also surged after arrest in 2024 The court reportedly allowed Durov to travel to Dubai , a city with no extradition agreements with many countries. The market’s reaction hints at the potential significance of this case for the crypto industry.

However, now its momentum has slowed, and investors are looking for what will be the next big winner after that – DuragDoge ($DURAG). With steady growth, strong demand, and a projected 1000% surge, DuragDoge is quickly emerging as the biggest player in the meme coin space. This article explains why DuragDoge could be the next big winner, and highlights its strong growth and unique features. Pepe (PEPE): From Record-Breaking Growth to a Sudden Crash Pepe was one of the best-performing meme coins of the current market cycle, having risen by nearly 30,000% since it was launched. It peaked in December of 2022 with an all-time high price, but the rally stalled, and PEPE dropped 70% from it’s all-time high. The price of PEPE has declined substantially since it hit its all-time high of $0.0000284 in December 2024. The downward trend continued up to Feb. 3, 2025, when it reached a low point, which was 70% lower than the all-time high. This downward movement created a high level of uncertainty and fear among investors as they try to identify which projects are likely to be more successful in the market. DuragDoge ($DURAG): A Community-Driven Meme Coin with Huge Growth Potential Attention has moved to DuragDoge after Pepe declined significantly from a high point. It has set a new standard for meme coins by performing remarkably well, despite the bearish market. The presale opens the event to professionals and those learning how to trade cryptocurrency with a discount of $0.0009 and other benefits, including high potential returns, lock-in profit, and reward access. With this new cryptocurrency ICO structured into ten phases and still in the early phase, investors have a high chance of hitting it big by participating now. The next phase will see a price surge to $0.0023, meaning more returns. Analysts added that upon launch, this value will increase to $0.010, offering early adopters 1000% returns and paving its way to challenge top players to Pepe. The project is based on a community-driven ecosystem that functions beyond a just meme coin. It promotes the use of stake, governance, and rewards to encourage people’s participation and prosper both the project and the investors. The combined system functions to advance project success and deliver benefits for all stakeholders. DuragDoge ($DURAG): A Deflationary Token with Strong Growth and Passive Rewards As a deflationary token, DuragDoge uses a burn mechanism and a buyback program to decrease the total supply. The scarcity that is realized by reducing the circulating supply benefits $DURAG and its holders. This deflationary model positions it among high potential altcoins since it guarantees that the value of the token increases with time, and anyone who holds it for the long run is in for a great profit. Another interesting feature contributing to the growth of DuragDoge is the staking system, which enables one to earn up to 20% APY by just locking in your $DURAG tokens. This is a real passive reward for investors, especially those who are still learning how to trade cryptocurrency. These unique features, coupled with the impressive performance, make it difficult to ignore $DURAG as the next potential meme coin in the market, while also challenging the results of popular players like Pepe. Final Thoughts Experts rank $DURAG among high potential altcoins due to its presale that is running fast, cheap, and secure, community-driven ecosystem, and a staking system that provides users with 20% APY.

Among the top cryptos to invest in today, Qubetics, Monero, and Solana are leading the charge, each offering unique opportunities for community members and early buyers. With the digital economy continuing to evolve, blockchain technology has positioned itself as a reliable alternative investment instrument to traditional assets. For many, top cryptos to invest in today are driven by the promise of future growth, innovative tech, and long-term stability. Qubetics has quickly become a standout in the market, especially with its presale events and real-world solutions. Let’s dive into the details of these three powerful projects that have earned their place at the top of the crypto charts. Qubetics: The Web3 Aggregator Revolution Qubetics, the world’s first web3 aggregator, has been steadily climbing the ranks of the top cryptos to invest in today, gaining significant attention from the crypto community. Qubetics is in its 25th crypto presale stage, with over $15 million raised 23,000 token holders, and over 499 $TICS million tokens sold. The project has sold more than 499 million $TICS tokens, with the current price set at $0.1074 per token. For community members who got in early, the potential returns are staggering: with a predicted price of $0.25 after the presale, that’s a 133% ROI. Analysts are even forecasting prices as high as $6 after the mainnet launch, resulting in a jaw-dropping 5,484% ROI. Qubetics is not just about numbers; it’s about delivering practical solutions to the digital world. One of its standout features is the Non-Custodial Multi-Chain Wallet, designed to streamline the crypto experience. Imagine being able to manage all your assets—across multiple chains—without relying on third-party services. For businesses, professionals, and individuals alike, this means greater autonomy and control over your assets. For example, a freelance digital artist can store their earnings from different blockchain networks securely in a single wallet, simplifying the process and reducing the need for multiple accounts. Monero: The Privacy Champion Monero has long been known for its focus on privacy, making it one of the top cryptos to invest in today for anyone looking to maintain anonymity in their transactions. As a privacy-centric cryptocurrency, Monero stands out by using advanced cryptographic techniques like ring signatures and stealth addresses to ensure that transactions are completely untraceable. Over the years, Monero has built a reputation as the go-to coin for users who prioritize privacy above all else. Monero’s robust security features make it appealing to those wary of traditional financial systems and surveillance. It’s often seen as the ultimate alternative for anyone looking for financial independence while maintaining their anonymity. With a market cap consistently placing it among the top 20 cryptocurrencies, Monero has established itself as a trusted and reliable choice for those who want to stay out of the public eye. Solana: Speed and Scalability for the Future Solana has quickly positioned itself as one of the top cryptos to invest in today due to its speed, scalability, and low transaction costs. Unlike many other blockchains that struggle with congestion and slow processing times, Solana’s high throughput enables it to process thousands of transactions per second without compromising on security. This makes Solana an ideal platform for decentralized applications (dApps) and decentralized finance (DeFi) projects. In addition to its technical advantages, Solana has garnered significant institutional interest, helping it break into the ranks of the top cryptocurrencies. Its fast-growing ecosystem of dApps, DeFi platforms, and NFT projects continues to attract community members, developers, and early buyers who see the potential for Solana to become a dominant force in the blockchain space. Conclusion: The Future of Crypto Investments Whether you’re looking at Monero’s privacy features, Solana’s scalability, or Qubetics’ innovative approach to Web3, it’s clear that these are among the top cryptos to invest in today . As the world shifts towards decentralized finance and digital assets, each of these projects offers something unique that appeals to both new and seasoned community members. With the market continuing to evolve, the time to get involved is now. For those considering adding new tokens to their portfolio, Qubetics, Monero, and Solana are leading the charge. Stay informed, act fast, and be part of the next wave of crypto adoption. The future of digital finance is bright, and these projects are paving the way forward.

His remarks, shared on X by crypto influencer Amelie (@_Crypto_Barbie), have excited the XRP community. Garlinghouse stated, “What Amazon was to books, Ripple is to cross-border payments.” The CEO’s statement suggests that Ripple aims to redefine global payments, much like how Amazon revolutionized online book sales and later expanded into multiple industries. BRAD GARLINGHOUSE: „WHAT AMAZON WAS TO BOOKS, RIPPLE IS TO CROSS BORDER PAYMENTS!“ #XRP pic.twitter.com/cL9z8T8xAn — 𝓐𝓶𝓮𝓵𝓲𝓮 (@_Crypto_Barbie) March 14, 2025 This comparison shows Ripple’s ambition to become a dominant force in the financial sector, leveraging XRP as a bridge asset for efficient, low-cost transactions. Why XRP Is Suited for the Role Garlinghouse’s confidence in XRP stems from its technical advantages. The asset enables near-instant transactions, with fast settlement times compared to the days traditional banking systems require. It also reduces costs, making it an attractive alternative for financial institutions handling high volumes of cross-border payments. Additionally, Ripple’s On-Demand Liquidity (ODL) solution eliminates the need for pre-funded accounts in different countries, improving capital efficiency for businesses. This gives XRP a competitive edge over legacy systems. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Can XRP Dominate the Global Payment System? XRP has been positioned as a solution to the inefficiencies of traditional cross-border transactions. Unlike existing systems that rely on intermediaries and incur high fees, Ripple’s technology allows for near-instant settlement with significantly lower costs. Many supporters have compared it to SWIFT, propping up the digital asset as a potential replacement . One commenter on X expressed enthusiasm for broader use of XRP beyond cross-border payments, suggesting its integration into corporate transactions, government refunds, and consumer payments. This reflects a growing belief that Ripple’s infrastructure could extend beyond its initial focus. The Market’s Perspective Many in the XRP community support Garlinghouse’s vision, with some comparing Ripple’s potential influence to that of Microsoft in the technology sector. A user noted that once financial institutions integrate with Ripple’s systems, they may become reliant on them in a way similar to how corporations continue using Windows despite its drawbacks. This highlights the perceived long-term staying power of Ripple’s technology. However, not all reactions were entirely optimistic. Some commenters pointed out that XRP’s success ultimately hinges on regulatory clarity and wider market adoption. While Ripple has made significant progress in securing partnerships with financial institutions, its legal battle with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission has held down XRP for years. However, recent reports revealed that both parties are negotiating and a settlement could be made public soon, freeing up Ripple and XRP to dominate the cross-border payments industry.

Ever since Trump won the US elections and promised a more favorable future for the crypto industry in the States, as well as to fire former SEC Chair Gary Gensler, the speculations about a potential resolution in the SEC vs. Ripple lawsuit have gone rampant. The rumors intensified as the US regulator dropped numerous cases against other crypto companies such as Coinbase , Consensys, Kraken, and more. Popular attorneys have also weighed in on whether Ripple will see a similar faith. Although some claim that the Ripple case is much more complicated due to its four-year long history and the penalty the company was slammed with last year, there are other experts who think the lawsuit has already been closed or will be in the near future. Should such a conclusion be around the corner, it is expected to massively impact the price of Ripple’s native token, which already surged by triple-digits after the favorable political and regulatory changes in the US. XRP whales have been particularly active in the past several months, and their behavior often results in an immediate impact on the asset’s price. Most recently, at the end of February, they were disposing of their XRP holdings, which led to a price drop to $2. However, Ali Martinez outlined a significant change in their strategy as they bought over 150 million XRP within a 2-day period alone. This begs the question whether they are positioning for the end of the lawsuit that started in December 2020.

Since the start of March, ADA has lost over 44% of its value, reflecting the broader negative sentiment surrounding altcoins as investors remain uncertain about the market’s next move. Related Reading: Ethereum Consolidates Since ‘The Big Dump’ – Local Trend Reversal Or Continuation? The entire crypto market has been under heavy selling pressure, and altcoins like Cardano have been hit the hardest. With fear gripping traders, ADA has failed to reclaim key levels, leaving many wondering if further downside is ahead. However, some analysts believe that a recovery rally could be on the horizon. Crypto analyst Ali Martinez recently shared a technical analysis on X, revealing that Cardano is about to break free from a bullish pattern. If confirmed, this technical setup could trigger a strong move to the upside, providing much-needed relief for ADA holders. The next few days will be crucial, as ADA must hold its current range and confirm a breakout to shift market sentiment. If bulls take control, Cardano could see a swift recovery, but failure to do so may result in continued downward pressure. Traders are watching closely for signs of strength or further weakness. Cardano Holds Strong Amid Market Weakness Cardano has been overperforming compared to the broader market over the past week, showing relative stability despite ongoing selling pressure. While most altcoins have struggled to find support, ADA has held its ground, maintaining a stronger structure than many of its peers. Related Reading: Solana Forms Classic Cup-And-Handle Pattern – Analyst Predicts A Breakout To $3,800 However, price action remains range-bound, with Cardano trading within a pattern that began forming in November 2024. The lack of a decisive breakout has left investors cautious, as sentiment across the market remains fearful. With altcoins underperforming against Bitcoin, traders are waiting for confirmation before committing to long positions. Martinez’s technical analysis highlights that Cardano is approaching a key moment. His analysis suggests that ADA is on the verge of breaking out of a bullish triangle pattern, a setup that has been developing for months. If confirmed, this breakout could trigger a 15% price move, pushing ADA toward higher resistance zones. For now, bulls must hold current levels to sustain positive momentum. If ADA breaks out of this triangle pattern, it could mark the start of a strong recovery, potentially sending prices toward multi-year highs. However, failure to hold support could result in further downside pressure, making the next few days critical for ADA’s direction. ADA Bulls Must Reclaim $0.80 For A Recovery Cardano is currently trading at $0.73, with bulls attempting to hold the 200-day moving average (MA) and the exponential moving average (EMA) as support. The market remains under pressure, and ADA must stay above this level to prevent a deeper correction. For a confirmed recovery rally, ADA needs to break above the $0.80 mark, which would indicate renewed bullish momentum and potentially open the door for higher price targets. A successful reclaim of this level could shift sentiment, allowing bulls to build strength for a larger move upward. However, failure to hold above current levels could trigger increased selling pressure. If ADA loses the key $0.69 support, a strong drop toward the $0.58 level is likely. This would extend the current downtrend, making a short-term recovery more difficult. Related Reading: Ethereum Net Taker Volume Signals Huge Selling Pressure – Can Bulls Hold Key Levels?

Murphy posted statistical data on social media, revealing that the average cost basis for ETH positions created between January and February 2025 ranged from $3,200 to $3,500. A significant cluster of addresses significantly increased their holdings to $3,475 by accumulating approximately 1.66 million ETH. This group did not buy the dip when ETH dropped to $1,900 and currently hold 1.94 million ETH, reducing their average cost to $3,150. Meanwhile, addresses that opened positions in mid-February 2025 had entry costs ranging from $2,600 to $2,800. As the price of ETH fell below $2,300, this group began to offload their holdings. Currently, only positions at $2,800 (1 million ETH) and $2,630 (850,000 ETH) remain unchanged. Related News: BREAKING: Donald Trump's Cryptocurrency Project Makes Weekend Strike - Starts Buying a New Altcoin As ETH continues its downward trend, new demand has weakened significantly, especially as the price has dropped below $2,000. Data suggests that buying interest has almost disappeared at these levels. Murphy explained that investors who accumulated ETH at higher price points have now exhausted their purchasing power after a series of attempts to reduce their costs on average. The $1,850 price level represents the cost basis for a large group of investors who established positions two years ago. When ETH approaches this level, they tend to buy back previously sold portions to reduce their overall costs, potentially creating a support zone. However, if $1,850 cannot hold, ETH could slide toward $1,600 or even $1,250, where the accumulation from three years ago could provide the last major support, according to the analyst. According to Murphy, the market recovery depends on rebuilding investor confidence in the long-term value of ETH. Without a renewed consensus, large accumulations at $2,630, $2,800, and $3,150 could act as significant resistance and limit any potential recovery. *This is not investment advice.

In a new video, pseudonymous analyst Credible tells his 69,000 YouTube subscribers that he’s looking at Bitcoin’s immediate resistance at $94,000. According to the analyst, Bitcoin’s downside momentum will likely persist as long as BTC trades below what he believes is a “local supply” zone. “We’re looking for some sort of a bottoming structure to form here, some sort of a shift in market structure for a potential reversal to the upside. And that gets confirmed once we clear this local supply here (at $94,000). And most importantly is seeing an impulsive move to the upside. And yes, sometimes they can be tricky to spot or identify… So we’re looking for again [an] impulsive move to the upside, ideally breaking local supply, and that is our indication that we’ve started the next leg to the upside.” Source: Credible/YouTube An impulsive rally in this case is based on Elliott Wave theory, which states that a bullish asset tends to witness a five-wave surge where waves one, three and five are upside moves and waves two and four are corrective periods. Looking at the trader’s chart, he seems to predict that BTC will soar close to $104,000 if it takes out resistance at $94,000. While Credible believes it is within the realm of possibility for BTC to end its downtrend after bouncing from a low of $76,000, he notes that Bitcoin’s heatmap indicates thick sell orders at around $86,000 with heavy demand below $84,000.

The cryptocurrency industry is going through a gauntlet due to the recent dip in the value of Bitcoin, which has dragged down many altcoins with it. This volatility and uncertainty seem to have created the perfect breeding ground for bad actors. Rather than wait out the storm, some are growing desperate enough to orchestrate scandals just to turn a profit. These types of schemes are not uncommon in the industry. In late 2024, the Cardano Foundation’s official X account was hacked.

Several incidents have taken place in the cryptocurrency industry. On February 26, Pump.fun’s X account was hacked, and the attackers used the account to promote fraudulent tokens. State-sponsored hacker groups have also been impersonating venture capitalists in virtual meetings to deceive and exploit stakeholders in the crypto space. In the cryptocurrency market, the word “compromised” can quickly tank a project as investors are typically wary of scams and shady projects. So, it’s no surprise that the Kaito AI team moved swiftly to contain the situation. Upon identifying the unauthorized activity, the Kaito AI team quickly regained control of the compromised accounts. They promptly deleted the misleading posts and issued statements reassuring users that the token wallets remained secure and uncompromised. The team emphasized that they had existing high-standard security measures in place to prevent such incidents, suggesting that the security breach was part of a broader trend of sophisticated social media account hacks targeting the crypto industry. The official Kaito AI account wrote; “This account and @Punk9277 (the founder Yu Hu’s account) were just compromised. The KAITO wallets were NOT and are NOT compromised. We now have regained access to the twitter accounts. Please bare with us as we investigate how this happened.” Yu Hu also made a post on his account after regaining access saying “nothing related to KAITO was compromised, no wallets or supply. My X account and the Kaito one were both compromised – with the hacker then posting false tweets. Once I was made aware, I checked the accounts and saw I was still logged into both so deleted the tweets, and changed the password.” Despite the swift response, the incident unfortunately had an immediate effect on the KAITO token’s market performance. The spread of false information led to a temporary dip in the token’s price, just as the perpetrators intended. However, the Kaito AI team’s quick action and transparent communication helped stabilize the situation putting an end to any further potential damage from the breach.

Price of Cardano (ADA) faces resistance on the path to $1.14 while Pepe Coin (PEPE) sees increased whale accumulation. Yet interest is building around Mutuum Finance (MUTM), currently in Phase 3 of its presale, with a $0.02 entry capable of delivering multichain returns after launch. Cardano’s (ADA) Important Resistance Level Test Cardano (ADA) continues to trade within a descending broadening wedge, a pattern that is traditionally associated with bullish reversals. Analysts point to $1.14 as the key resistance level, which, when surpassed, would see the altcoin target $2 before $4.50. But if it fails, it risks additional consolidation. Of note, skepticism remains over Cardano’s (ADA) ability to deliver new levels of momentum despite a 300% rally since last late 2024, amid slumping on-chain activity. whale transaction indicating confidence, but with a long, volatile road ahead toward the elusive $4.50, investors are keeping their optimism in check. Pepe’s (PEPE) Increasing Whale Power Pepe Coin (PEPE) is up 15% on the day as three whales collect the equivalent of 689 billion tokens worth $4.3 million. Technical indicators showing the TD Sequential flash buy signals that suggest a potential jump of 50% towards $0.00001085 for Pepe Coin (PEPE). However, Pepe Coin (PEPE) meme-driven hype stands in stark contrast to utility driven projects. Analysts see falling big transactions since February and raise questions about long term growth. The recent Pepe Coin (PEPE) surge to $0.0001 is believable, though Pepe’s long-run future would be a matter of speculative trading and not intrinsic worth. Presale Momentum of Mutuum Finance Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is the talking point as presale phase 3 heats up ($3.4M raised, 5,700 holders) On sale for $0.02, the token represents a 25% pump for those who invest before Phase 4, when the price rises to $0.025. Tokenomics incidentally unveil an obvious direction: launch at $0.06; 200% returns, post-launch target at $6; 30,000%, analysts confident on lending model. The Mutuum Finance (MUTM) decentralized borrow mechanism along with the dynamic interest rates on the platform, and its mtTokens (interest accruing deposit certificates) generate a natural buy pressure. Tokenomics with a revenue-sharing mechanism to stabilize growth and redistribute purchased tokens back to stakers of Mutuum Finance (MUTM). Mutuum Finance (MUTM) presale Phase 3 is filling fast with the last opportunity to invest at a low price before exchange quotes. Ahead of the launch, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is undergoing a smart contract audit by Certik, increasing confidence in its underlying infrastructure. Results will be announced through social channels balancing transparency with investor expectations. With a structured token allocation plan that prioritizes liquidity, development and partnerships, the Mutuum Finance (MUTM) project is well positioned for scalable adoption. An Intentionally Timed Opportunity in The Crypto Market Some trends are left and others right, but only one has a real roadmap: Mutuum Finance, which exceeds the vague semantics of Cardano and Pepe. The Mutuum Finance (MUTM) early participants not only get some near-term payback but a piece of a platform that is fusing DeFi innovation with real world useappe. Phase 3 fills fast, and the moment to scale for Mutuum Finance (MUTM) at $0.02 closes—these are a crossroads for holders interested in growth rather than speculation.

However, XRP is an exception, experiencing a notable decline despite the broader uptrend. XRP’s Recent Decline and Key Support Level In the past 24 hours, XRP has dropped 1.89%, but support at the 200 EMA on the 15-minute chart prevented further losses. This suggests sellers are active, yet buyers are defending key levels. XRP Price Action Short-Term Technical Outlook On the daily chart, XRP closed bullish on March 15, signaling resilience. The current 4-hour candle also appears set to close bullish, reinforcing short-term optimism. However, for a sustained rally , buyers must build momentum to clear major resistance. The $2.45 level, which previously acted as a turning point, remains a major hurdle. Until buyers show stronger conviction, XRP will likely stay in consolidation. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Expected Price Range and Potential Breakout In the short term, XRP is expected to trade between $2.30 and $2.60. A break above $2.45 could push prices toward $2.90 before another retracement. However, if selling pressure rises, a drop below $2.30 could trigger further losses. Market Sentiment and Midterm Outlook In the broader view, XRP remains range-bound, with neither bulls nor bears in full control. Low trading volume reflects weak buying interest, reducing the likelihood of sharp moves soon. For traders and investors, this phase may present an accumulation opportunity before a stronger trend develops. Currently, XRP trades at $2.3760, reflecting a neutral stance as bulls and bears struggle for control. The next decisive move depends on trading volume and overall market sentiment.

Here’s What Is Next,https://timestabloid.com/xrp-dominance-exhibiting-tremendous-strength-heres-what-is-next/,"XRP’s market dominance is showing strong momentum, with its percentage share of the total cryptocurrency market on the verge of surpassing key historical levels. Crypto analyst EGRAG CRYPTO (@egragcrypto) recently highlighted this trend, emphasizing that XRP is close to closing above the 6% dominance mark, a level last seen in 2021. This threshold aligns with the Fibonacci 0.5 retracement level, which the analyst describes as a critical indicator of a bullish breakout. He suggests that if XRP successfully secures a close above this level, it could lead to an aggressive upward movement toward the Fibonacci 0.888 level, which ranges between 15% and 20% dominance. This potential surge aligns with historical highs from 2015, reinforcing the argument that XRP could enter a phase of significant strength. #XRP Dominance – Exhibiting Tremendous Strength: 1⃣ #XRP dominance is on the verge of closing above the 2021 high of 6%, surpassing Fib 0.5, which I consider a critical level and super #Bullish sign once ti happens. 2⃣ If #XRP dominance successfully closes above Fib 0.5, we… pic.twitter.com/OHvzYjH7dt — EGRAG CRYPTO (@egragcrypto) March 15, 2025 Historical Patterns and Future Targets EGRAG CRYPTO’s analysis highlights historical XRP dominance levels, marking key moments in 2015, 2017, and 2021 as reference points. Each of these years saw significant spikes in market dominance, followed by corrections. The spikes in 2017 and 2021 occurred close to notable price surges, and the current trajectory suggests that the digital asset is exhibiting similar strength, potentially setting up for another rally. A successful close above the 6% mark would signify a departure from previous consolidation phases and could validate XRP’s ability to regain substantial market share. The long-term projection suggests a potential dominance of 31.35%, a figure that would position XRP as a dominant force in the cryptocurrency market. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Can XRP Dominate the Crypto Ecosystem? Beyond technical analysis, XRP’s fundamental role in digital asset transactions and cross-border payments remains a crucial factor in its dominance. As one of the leading protocols for transferring value over the internet, XRP’s utility continues to attract institutional and retail investors. EGRAG CRYPTO reinforced this perspective, stating that achieving “31% dominance is only the beginning,” Ripple is rapidly expanding its global partnerships to improve XRP’s growth and adoption. The Road Ahead While the analysis presents a bullish outlook, market conditions remain a determining factor in XRP’s trajectory. Regulatory developments, overall crypto market trends, and investor sentiment will help shape the asset’s dominance. However, the technical indicators presented in the chart suggest a strong foundation for growth if XRP successfully closes above the 6% threshold. Ripple and the SEC are currently negotiating a settlement to their legal battle, suggesting regulatory hurdles may soon disappear. Major Ripple partners like Bank of America have the infrastructure ready to use crypto payments , and XRP is on the verge of something big.

Conflicting market signals created bearish pressure, preventing traders from setting a clear directional trend. As a result, major altcoins like Ethereum and XRP dropped below crucial price points. However, following hints from US CPI and PPI data that inflation may be easing, the market rallied, setting the stage for a potentially bullish week ahead. Interest Rate Decision Could Revive Crypto Amid a 2% drop last week, Bitcoin continues to face significant downside risks due to multiple bearish macroeconomic pressures. On a brighter note, analysts in the crypto prediction markets, such as Polymarket, are optimistic about a potential pause in Federal Reserve rate hikes next week. Additionally, there is growing hope that geopolitical tensions between Russia and Ukraine might ease. Bettors on Polymarket are pricing in a 99% likelihood of the Fed pausing rate hikes in March, with the odds of a Russia-Ukraine ceasefire reaching nearly 80%. Should these developments occur, a surge in risk appetite could lead to increased investments in Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, potentially triggering further upward momentum next week. Bitcoin Price Prediction Bitcoin bulls are attempting a recovery, though they are likely to encounter significant resistance between the EMA20 trend line and the $86.7K mark. Currently, the BTC price stands at $84,262, having risen by 0.09% in the past 24 hours. If the price remains above the 20-day EMA, it could suggest that the recent dip below $84K was merely a bear trap. Under such circumstances, the BTC/USDT pair might climb to the critical $86.7K level and potentially extend to $93,000. On the other hand, if the price sharply declines from this resistance zone, it would suggest that bears have the upper hand. This could increase the likelihood of a drop to the crucial support level at $79,974. Ethereum Price Prediction Ether has been facing rising volatility around the descending resistance line, suggesting increasing domination among buyers and sellers. ETH price has been consolidating below the crucial $2K mark. As of writing, ETH price trades at $1,923, surging over 0.2% in the last 24 hours. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) is beginning to exhibit early signs of a positive divergence. Should the price breach the EMA50 trend line, the ETH/USDT pair might ascend to the breakdown level of $2,109. At this level, bears might intensify their selling efforts; however, if the bulls manage to sustain their momentum, the pair could advance towards the 50-day SMA at $2,530. This positive outlook would be invalidated if the price fails to hold at $2,109 and subsequently falls below $1,772. Such a move would indicate a bearish dominance. XRP Price Prediction XRP bounced off the $2 support level and broke above the EMA20 trend line on the 1-hour chart. Bears are attempting to stop the recovery at this EMA, but continued buying pressure from bulls suggests a potential breakout above it. If successful, the XRP/USDT pair could climb to $2.65. Surpassing this level might set the stage for a rally to $2.97. Conversely, a sharp decline from the current level would indicate that sentiment remains bearish. In such a case, the pair might revisit the critical $2 support.",Price Analysis|Altcoins|Bitcoin|Bitcoin ETF|Ethereum|Ripple (XRP),EN,0,0,TRADING|BTC|ETH|XRP|MARKET,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-03-16 07:54:36

Wells Fargo is suing JPMorgan Chase, the largest back in the US, over accusations it greenlighted a real estate loan even though it allegedly knew that the financial statements were fraudulent, reports Reuters. In 2019, JPMorgan issued a loan to real estate development and investment firm Chetrit Group to finance the purchase of 43 multi-family buildings with 8,671 apartments across 10 states. Acting as the investors’ trustee, Wells Fargo alleges that JPMorgan and Chetrit knew that the sellers had fraudulently inflated the buildings’ historical net operating income by 25% even before closing the deal at $522 million. A property’s historical net income is a financial metric that measures the income generated by a building over a specific time frame. A property’s past earnings are typically used to assess its potential value. Wells Fargo claims that JPMorgan approved the overvalued property deal to reap millions of dollars in fees, thinking that the assets would eventually be dumped on investors who wouldn’t realize the buildings were not as profitable as declared on paper. Chetrit’s loan turned sour in 2022 and, in the process, Wells Fargo says investors in the trust have lost tens of millions of dollars. “[JPMorgan] had an obligation to engage in due inquiry to determine the scope of the fraudulent reporting. Instead, [JPMorgan] plowed ahead as if nothing unusual had happened without even bothering to correct known errors in the numbers.” Wells Fargo is asking the court to order JPMorgan to either pay for damages or repurchase the loan and make the investors whole. JPMorgan and Chetrit have not yet issued a statement regarding the case.

Solana and Dogecoin have witnessed their prices skyrocketing, with investors hanging in suspense as uncertainty looms over their immediate future. Simultaneously, a potentially powerful new token is generating buzz with its innovative approach to seamless international payments. Its practical utility and solid DeFi foundation position it among the leaders, drawing in early adopters who are keen to capitalize on its present discounted value. Solana: A Look at the Recent Price Change The latest Solana news has seen the token at about $135.34 today , up by 6% within the past 24 hours. SOL had been performing poorly in the last few weeks, as per some reports, and the recent upsurge is the beginning of potential recovery. Experts have attributed market pressure and technical issues as the causes of the recent dip. Other forecasters predict Solana to recover by 10.39% and be worth $146.93 as of April 14 , as long as upgrades to the network work as planned. Investors are closely watching Solana prices so they can invest when it is appropriate. The network also supports thousands of applications with minimal fees for transactions but current stress is causing owners to question short-term gains. Dogecoin: A Popular Token Facing a Downturn Dogecoin has a strong brand and loyal community. Recent updates show that Dogecoin price has fallen by roughly 10% over the past week and currently sits at $0.1768. The token has, however, also begun a recovery that many experts believe is sustainable. Dogecoin still finds support among fans and technical signals and market data point to a bullish trend. DOGE is expected to rise by 233.88% and reach $0.5777 by April 14. Many investors check the latest Dogecoin price to see if the prediction still holds true. The decline of the past week has also led some holders to rethink their strategies and search for alternatives with real-world use. Remittix: A New DeFi Project with Real-World Impact Remittix stands out with its one-point mission to rectify a significant evil in cross-border remittances. Standard international remittances are slow, days to process, and very expensive because of excessive charges. Remittix offers the option of sending money quickly at an affordable cost. Its PayFi platform bridges crypto with traditional finance without sacrificing user privacy. It keeps total control with individuals over their own funds but allows them to deposit funds for pick-up at the local point of cash pick-up nearest to them. Many people with an estimated 1.4 billion globally do not have a bank account. They may get crypto into a wallet, send it to a cash transfer agent like Western Union, and then get cash to spend on daily expenses.

Gamers result to alternatives,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/playstation-subscriptions-even-worth-it/,"Paying $160 for a year of PlayStation Plus Premium should be enough to keep you in the house for at least six months. A few seconds of scrolling through the catalog, and you realize… wait, is this it? A handful of decent titles, some good retro classics, and a multiplayer mode you’ll never touch because you’d rather not hear a 12-year-old screaming his lungs out of how you “suck at Fortnite.” So, PS Plus, what gives? For the first time in 15yrs I am ending my PlayStation Plus subscription. The cost has gotten to be too much and we don’t see anything in return for the increase. I remember making fun of Xbox owners for having to pay to play online. This is overdue. @PlayStation #goodbye pic.twitter.com/38345p6kwQ — American made (@Glizzy_Guice) February 17, 2025 Your Xbox-owning friend is locked into several day-one releases from Bethesda games on Game Pass, and your PC gamer buddy is cackling over a $5 Steam sale haul. Are PlayStation’s subscription services even worth it, or are gamers better off looking elsewhere? I have dabbled in both console and PC worlds, and I could tell you that PS Plus is not bad, but it’s passable. What does PS Plus include? PlayStation Plus, Sony’s flagship subscription service, comes in threes: Essential, Extra, and Premium, with prices ranging from $80 to $160 annually. The sub has features like online multiplayer, monthly “free” games, and, for the higher tiers, a catalog of titles to stream or download, including some games from PlayStation 1, 2, 3, and 4. On paper, it sounds like a good deal, especially given how new games now cost $69 to $89 a pop. But in all reality, after a few weeks of 8-hour-a-day gaming sessions on the daily, you would get bored. PS Plus doesn’t really offer much when stacked against competitors like Xbox Game Pass or “free-for-all” PC gaming. Let’s try out PS Plus (The good) I’m not completely dismissing Sony’s service. Even a broken clock is right twice a day, no? For certain classes of gamers, like streamers and trophy hunters, PS Plus is a solid deal. If you’re new to the PlayStation ecosystem, $89 for AAA titles, compared to paying $135–$160 a year for access to hundreds of games, is an absolute no-brainer. Then there are the Extra and Premium tiers, which offer a catalog of games to download or stream. For the trophy hunters out there, PS Plus makes it so much easier to stack up the records, regardless of how rage-inducing the experience is on some games ( You might want to steer clear of Wolfenstein 2’s Mein Leben if you are always low on patience. ) In short, PS Plus was made for competitive multiplayer fiends, trophy hunters, indie game die-hards, and newcomers looking to save a buck. What about the rest of us? Maybe it’s not that good (The bad) Let’s talk about the elephant in the room: the PS Plus game catalog. If you’re paying for the Extra or Premium tiers, you’re expecting Baldur’s Gate 3 or God of War titles, right? Well, you’ll get the 2018 God of War at least. The first 45 games on PlayStation Plus $159.99 premium package. An absolute joke. Last year was not this bad, it wasn’t great but it wasn’t bad at all. This has been a SHIT year for PlayStation Plus. Get yourself an Xbox and Game Pass if you’re thinking of going PlayStation pic.twitter.com/JrA714B1Qf — HonkeyKong (@JalapenoHogz) March 8, 2025 Xbox Game Pass offers hundreds of games, including day-one releases like Starfield, but PS Plus feels like the clearance rack at a thrift store. Sure, you might find a gem or ten, but you’re mostly sifting through titles you might have never thought existed because of how boring they are. We could take the Extra tier, which has “up to 400 PS4 and PS5 games,” but a quick scroll reveals a lot of never heard of indie titles, older AAA games you’ve already played umpteen times, and the occasional “discount of the month” that’s on sale for $10 almost everywhere. All you are left with is to just replay The Last of Us for the 17th time. PC looks like a better alternative (The better?) I get it. Building a good gaming PC tower is nowhere cheap; $1,500 or more on a rig with an RTX 3090 or better will do, three times more than a PS5 slim. But once it’s on your table, the performance is unreal. Steam sales can snag you AAA titles for as little as $5. I’ve lost count of how many times my friends have walked away from a sale with five games for the price of Spiderman 2 on the PlayStation store. I fucking HATE capitalism Even the highest playstation plus subscription doesn't get you alot of critically acclaimed games and the games themselves are expensive as fuck https://t.co/Ace3A3WmKL — Toranaga-sama (@natakapesa) March 2, 2025 Then there’s the performance factor. With a high-end PC, you’re not playing 1440p video quality upscaled by AMD’s technology to 4K; it’s a clean native 4K at 120 frames per second (FPS), with ray tracing and path tracing. Graphics so realistic you’d swear you could smell the rain on CyberPunk 2077. Don’t get me wrong, what the PS5 can do in terms of visuals is impressive, but on most games, it is locked at 60 FPS. And let’s not forget the modding community. PC gamers can breathe new life into old titles, make graphical overhauls to entirely new or old campaigns. See what modders did in the Grand Theft Auto Vice City Nextgen Edition , building VC on GTA IV’s engine. Looks like a whole new game. PS5 gamers are stuck with whatever Sony deems worthy of the PS Plus catalog. PS Plus needs to do better So, what’s the fix? If Xbox Game Pass can launch Halo Infinite or Starfield on day one, why can’t PS Plus do the same with God of War or Horizon ? Second, please beef up the catalog with more titles that we can have fun playing. We’re not asking for the moon, just a few more recent AAA titles and fewer obscure indies that feel like padding. Third, make the Premium tier actually worth it; we all know that PS5 can play PS3 titles because it’s arguably backward compatible (YouTubers have done a lot of research on this). Please include every PS3 game; some of us will be extremely happy to play Smackdown Vs Raw 2011 once again, the WWE2K era isn’t cutting it for us anymore. And while we’re at it, how about a loyalty program? If I’ve been subscribed to PS Plus for a decade, throw me a bone, maybe a discount on new releases or exclusive content. Here’s a wild idea: why not let PS Plus subscribers vote on which games get added to the catalog each month? It’d give us a sense of being “part of a community” and might prevent the inevitable groans when the latest “free” game is something nobody asked for. PS Plus isn’t entirely terrible; it’s just not great. For those of us who game for fun, not for multiplayer glory, it’s just not enough. Time for Sony to step up their game, pun-absolutely intended.",OP-ED|PlayStation 5|Sony|Xbox,EN,0,0,MARKET|RESEARCH|TECHNOLOGY|TRADING,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-03-16 08:23:24

The quick price moves make people ask if ADA will stay steady or if the market will soon change. While ADA fights to keep a steady pace, FXGuys works well and raised over $4.5 million in its presale without market trouble. The Top PropFi Project shows investors trust strong basics rather than wild price shifts. >>>JOIN FXGUYS HERE Cardano’s Price Swings Leave Investors on Edge ADA’s price moves unpredictably as significant changes cause traders to ask if this stage is one of buying or a sign of unreliability. The asset shows high unpredictability, which makes it hard for investors to gain small profits quickly. Some people say ADA’s shifting pattern may come before a price increase, while others watch carefully noting that promising altcoins with clear uses receive more focus. Although Cardano was once seen as a good blockchain project, its price still faces regular market ups and downs. As traders look for top defi coins that offer steadiness with everyday uses, FXGuys appears as a less risky and more satisfying choice. FXGuys’ Presale Climbs Steadily, Raising Over $4.5 Million! In comparison to ADA, whose price moves remain unclear, FXGuys records solid, constant growth. Investors join Stage 3 of the FXGuys presale, where the $FXG token sells at $0.05. With more than $4.5 million collected, the project proves that a reliable business plan plus investor trust count more than short-lived price guesses. Traders now use the FXGuys BETA platform to test the prop trading site free of charge before the complete launch. This clear approach draws skilled traders who see the lasting value of the FXGuys prop trading fund program along with Trade2Earn rewards. Why FXGuys Is Outpacing Market Uncertainty The FX Guys change how proprietary trading firms work by giving traders and investors different advantages. FXGuys does not depend on unpredictable digital coins; it is based on actual trading methods. Traders who put up $FXG get a 20% part of profits from broker trading volume, which forms a steady extra income. The Trader Funding Program also lets traders use up to $500,000 in funds, with profits split 80/20 in favor of successful traders after their tests. FXGuys keeps its system simple and easy to use. The service does not charge fees for buying or selling and there is no need for KYC, which protects privacy and stays away from centralized control. It also lets users quickly take out money in both cash and crypto in more than 100 local currencies making FXGuys one of the more adaptable and trader-friendly setups available. FXGuys vs. ADA: The Clear Winner for Investors With ADA facing erratic price movements, investors are looking for a smart prop trader solution that offers stability and profitability. Unlike ADA, which depends on speculative price growth, FXGuys offers an active and rewarding ecosystem through its Trade2Earn model. Every trade made on the platform earns traders $FXG tokens, increasing trading activity while rewarding users for their engagement. Another advantage FXGuys has over ADA is its custom trading infrastructure. The FXGuys Trader platform is optimized for proprietary trading and gives users the option to choose from MT5, Match-Trader, cTrader, and DXtrade, depending on their location and trading style. >>>JOIN FXGUYS HERE Final Thoughts While Cardano’s volatility raises concerns, FXGuys shows that strong fundamentals and investor trust lead to sustainable growth. The project’s presale has already crossed $4.5 million, proving that traders prioritise projects with real earning potential over speculative assets. FXGuys is leading the charge in the crypto prop trading space, offering traders a risk-free way to access large trading accounts, stake for passive income, and trade without unnecessary taxes or KYC barriers. With its presale still ongoing, investors can secure $FXG tokens before they hit the open market.

This 24-hour price recovery is part of a 15% recovery after Shiba Inu reached a low of $0.00001102 on March 11, which is its lowest point in over a year. In spite of the modest increase in price, a slowdown in a key Shiba Inu metric might threaten this price recovery that’s just beginning. This threat is revealed in the Shiba Inu burn rate, which has taken a massive 99.44% nosedive in the past 24 hours. Related Reading: 200 Million XRP On The Move—Is Ripple Preparing For A Big Play? Shiba Inu Burn Rate Plummets 99% In A Day Shiba Inu’s burn mechanism has long been considered a vital factor in its tokenomics, reducing the supply to create scarcity and, in turn, drive up value. However, in the last 24 hours, on-chain data shows that SHIB’s burn rate has dropped by an alarming 99.44%, which is a sharp change to the relatively high burn numbers recorded in previous days. According to data from the Shiba Inu burn tracker Shibburn, a total of 2,811,819 SHIB tokens have been sent to burn addresses in the past 24 hours. Although this might look like a lot of tokens at first glance, it actually falls short of the volume required to make an impact in the current market conditions. It also marks a 99.44% decline from the over 500 million SHIB tokens burned in the previous 24-hour timeframe. Shiba Inu Burn Crash Could Spell Trouble With Weak Market Sentiment The burn rate’s volatility has often coincided with fluctuations in trading volume and overall market sentiment, and this latest crash raises doubts about whether investors are still committed to the long-term burn initiative. The idea behind the Shiba Inu burn process, where SHIB tokens are sent to any of three dead wallets, is that the available supply diminishes by continuously removing SHIB tokens from circulation. This, in turn, makes the remaining tokens more valuable and helps prevent further price declines during market crashes. Related Reading: TRUMP Token Takedown—Did Insiders Plan The Crash? At the time of writing, Shiba Inu is trading at $0.00001285, up by about 3% in the past 24 hours. A resurgence in the burn rate would be an important factor for Shiba Inu to maintain its recent gains and push for further recovery. A consistent and substantial burn rate would contribute to the notion that Shiba Inu has already established a local bottom at $0.00001102 and pave the way for a stronger uptrend. On the other hand, if the burn rate continues to decline over the next 24 hours, it could weaken this recovery effort and increase the likelihood of a retracement back toward its March 11 low.

As expected, his comments have stirred excitement among many XRP holders. According to Geraci, a Solana ETF filing could happen at any moment. This is expected to aid the approval of many waiting XRP ETF applications. BREAKING: ETFStore President says: “BlackRock will file for both Solana and #XRP ETFs.” pic.twitter.com/lwkqEQGLq2 — JackTheRippler © (@RippleXrpie) March 14, 2025 BlackRock’s Growing Presence in Crypto ETFs BlackRock is the world’s largest asset manager and has already established a strong foothold in the crypto market through Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs. Given its dominance in this space, analysts believe BlackRock may want to enter the market quickly to establish a strong foothold with the new digital assets. Other asset managers, such as Grayscale and VanEck, have already submitted applications for Solana and XRP ETFs, further intensifying competition. Increasing Excitement for XRP and SOL ETFs There is increasing institutional interest in ETFs tied to alternative cryptocurrencies beyond Bitcoin and Ethereum. Solana has received significant attention from firms looking to launch ETFs in the U.S. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 In late 2024, the SEC, under former Chair Gary Gensler, refused to approve Solana ETF applications . However, the new leadership has exhibited a favorable stance toward cryptocurrencies, and the regulator may finally approve Solana ETFs. BlackRock has also previously shown some knowledge of XRP’s status, as the form referenced the Ripple lawsuit when applying for its Bitcoin ETF. This supports Geraci’s idea that the asset manager will apply for an XRP ETF once the lawsuit ends. Regulatory Challenges and Timing for XRP ETF The primary factor delaying an XRP ETF filing is the ongoing SEC lawsuit against Ripple. Geraci emphasized that BlackRock is likely waiting for the lawsuit’s conclusion before moving forward with an XRP ETF, as the legal outcome will influence the SEC’s stance on XRP’s classification as a security or a commodity. With Ripple and the SEC negotiating a settlement , this hurdle may disappear soon. The end of this lawsuit could give XRP a major push, and a BlackRock ETF application shortly after a settlement could send the asset to heights never seen before.

Bitcoin Price Analysis: Bulls Target $86K Breakout Bitcoin (BTC/USD) is consolidating around $84,250, struggling to break above a key resistance zone near $84,500-$86,000. The 50-period EMA at $83,550 is providing support, reinforcing the uptrend from $79,900. A breakout above $86,000 could trigger a bullish move toward $89,600, followed by $92,700 if momentum sustains. However, failure to clear resistance may result in a pullback to $83,500, with stronger support at $79,900. The ascending trendline suggests buyers remain in control, but a higher volume breakout is needed to confirm a rally. Traders should watch for a clear move above $86,000 for further upside confirmation, while a drop below $83,500 could shift momentum bearish.

A few hours ago, WLFI invested $2 million USDT to purchase 103,911 AVAX tokens and an additional $2 million USDT to acquire 2.45 million MNT tokens. The company stated that the tokens would reduce loss and stabilize finances. Despite these measures, WLFI has had considerable financial difficulty over the last few years. The company’s crypto investments in 11 cryptocurrencies total around $340 million. Notable assets include but are not limited to, Ethereum (ETH), Wrapped Bitcoin (WBTC), TRON (TRX), Chainlink (LINK), Aave (AAVE), Ethena (ENA), Movement Network (MOVE), Ondo Finance (ONDO), Sei Network (SEI), AVAX, and MNT. As it stands, though, the portfolio shows an overall unrealized loss of over $115 million, with Ethereum (ETH) alone contributing to an $88 million shortfall. Controversies disrupt WLFI and TRON partnerships World Liberty Financial’s relationship with the TRON blockchain is one of the more controversial aspects of WLFI’s operations. Critics object to partnering with TRON because of connections to illegal finance operations. WLFI has not yet sold its holdings, but they are showing less value than what it initially paid for its investments. Ethereum (ETH) saw its biggest loss of around $88 million. That makes up more than half of WLFI’s total losses. But WLFI has not been unscathed, like most cryptocurrencies, and its large holding of ETH has proved to be a huge drag on its financials as ETH has tanked. Other poor-performing investments have included Wrapped Bitcoin (WBTC) and TRON (TRX). Although the company’s investments in AVAX and MNT as a hedge arrived later than it would have preferred, they could prove beneficial in the long run. However, the mounting losses remain a pressing concern. WLFI was also recognized as a top content provider for its crypto project. In October 2024, it received $300 million from WLFI token sales. Interest from other investors, however, trailed well below expectations. Its new target was a paltry $30 million. By October 31, 2024, WLFI had only managed to garner $14 million — putting its prospects in jeopardy. Another layer of pressure comes from ethical and political criticism WLFI’s connection to the Trump family has sparked attention and scrutiny. Trump’s name has been a promotional tool for investors, but he insists it gives the project credibility. A key question emerging from this situation is whether a sitting president can regulate an industry in which he or his family have a direct financial stake. Trump has already stated his disdain for former SEC Chair Gary Gensler and is already taking a more lenient approach to crypto regulation. The fact that Trump’s sons, who are actively promoting WLFI while holding central roles in his administration, only deepens concerns about the potential for self-dealing. According to Bloomberg’s Zeke Faux in an MSNBC segment on The 11th Hour with Stephanie Ruhle, one of the business partners who is working with Trump in WLFI is Chase Herro, a self-described “ dirtbag of the internet” famous for selling suspect financial products. These details imply serious questions about WLFI’s legitimacy because Herro was highly engaged with the project. His dubious past — selling get-rich-quick schemes, colon cleanses, and online marketing businesses — raises the ethical bar on the crypto venture.

More recently, HUT 8 was able to grow total revenue by 69% for the full year 2024. Gross margins improved, but the company still lost money during the year. The reported $338 million in positive net income for 2024 was entirely due to a $509 million unrealized gain in the company's Bitcoin holdings. Given the company's stock is getting close to its book value at the end of 2024, I suspect further downside in HUT is somewhat limited. But I'd wager BTC outperforms. Four months ago, I reiterated a 'hold ' on Hut 8 ( HUT ) (HUT:CA) after what, I felt, was a half decent third quarter report for the company. At that time, my biggest issue with the buying HUT shares was what, I felt, was an inflated valuation. With another quarter of performance and two months of mining production to assess, I felt it was worth providing readers with an update on Hut 8. This may not come as much of a surprise to those who have followed my work on public Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) miners over the last few years, but I see significant problems in Hut's underlying business. 2024 Full-Year Performance For the quarter ended December, Hut reported $31.7 million in top line revenue. This was a 27% decline sequentially and a 23% decline year over year. The good news is the full-year picture is noticeably better than what was reported for the fourth quarter: Revenue 000s Year Ended 2024 Year Ended 2023 YOY Power $56,602 $22,794 148.3% Digital Infrastructure $17,482 $8,291 110.9% Compute $80,701 $64,851 24.4% Other $7,600 $110 6809.1% Total Revenue $162,385 $96,046 69.1% Source: Hut 8, 10-K Full-year revenue came in at $162.4 million. Which was a 69% increase year over year against a COGS increase of about 60%. COGS 000s Year Ended 2024 Year Ended 2023 YOY Power $21,538 $7,263 196.5% Digital Infrastructure $15,556 $4,321 260.0% Compute $44,977 $42,592 5.6% Other $4,584 $18 25366.7% Total COGS $86,655 $54,194 59.9% Source: Hut 8 Compute - which now includes both revenue from Bitcoin mining and Data Center cloud services - finished the year at just under 50% of total revenue. The reliance from this segment was 67% in 2023. Compute also happened to exhibit the best year-over-year growth in gross margin, having moved from 34.3% in 2023 to 44.3% in 2024. This segment reporting structure is new for Hut 8: Q4 Deck, Slide 11 (Hut 8) Prior to this report, mining and HPC were broken out as their own segments. Going forward, they'll be included together under 'compute.' One of the stated reasons for this change is for better transparency, but I find that to be open for debate. Mining margins face clear long-term headwinds, and I would suspect Hut 8's data center cloud and GPU-as-a-service solutions offer far better long-term prospects. But I digress. Net Income from Operations 000s Year Ended 2024 Year Ended 2023 YOY Depreciation & Amortization $47,773 $17,537 172.41% G&A $72,917 $49,133 48.41% Operating income $460,539 $9,396 4801.44% Other expenses $8,629 -$12,567 -168.66% Net income from Operations $338,453 $21,773 1454.46% Gain on Digital Assets $509,337 $32,626 1461.14% Net Income sans Paper Gain -$170,884 -$10,853 1474.53% Source: Hut 8 Full-year net income from operations is reported as $338 million, though it bears mentioning that this net income performance is entirely reliant on unrealized gains in the company's Bitcoin holdings. So for all of the revenue diversification efforts, HUT shares will likely continue to go as Bitcoin goes until there is a larger share of top-line coming from non-Bitcoin-correlated business lines. Balance Sheet At the end of December, Hut 8 held over $85 million in cash and held $256.8 million in current assets: Hut 8 10-K Notably, Hut's Bitcoin stack was more encumbered at the end of 2024 than it was at the end of 2023. In the era of 'BTC yield,' it's likely of some importance that shareholder dilution is accretive to 'sats per share' for companies that stack Bitcoins the way Hut 8 has been able to. But Sats per share growth has generally not been the case for HUT: Author's Chart, HUT & Seeking Alpha data The chart above is showing the sat-backing of each HUT share going back to the last three years. While the metric was quite stable through most of 2024, the year-end figure was down 36.8% from December 2023. Nonetheless, HUT's share price grew by nearly 40% between the end of 2023 through 2024. Given Bitcoin's price more than doubled over this same time frame, I think anyone who has held HUT as a long-term proxy investment for BTC has justifiably been disappointed. Shifting to liabilities: Hut 8, 10-K With $538.2 million in total liabilities against $1.5 billion in total assets, stockholder equity at the end of the year came in at $980.5 million. With 99.5 million shares outstanding, HUT's book value per share was roughly $9.85 at the end of the year. Which I think likely limits the stock's downside as long as the price of Bitcoin holds long term supports. Looking Ahead A poor relative return in 2024 is history. Do HUT investors have reason to be optimistic for 2025? That likely depends on what shareholders are looking for out of the underlying business. As a mining company, the stock faces challenges. Though the coin price has indeed rebounded from sub-$80k levels earlier in March, the economics of mining Bitcoin remain tough. Data by YCharts Global hash rate continues to make new highs year after year. Compounded by lower BTC prices relative to December and January highs, Hashprice remains near all-time lows: 3mo Hash Price Trend (HashRateIndex) At $48, March 14th is the 7th consecutive day Bitcoin's dollar denominated revenue per PHS/day has been under $50. Again, this is part of a broader trend down over time as BTC emissions from block rewards continue to erode every four years. That said, this PHS/day figure reconciles higher if global hash declines or if BTC prices increase. Typically, when the latter happens, it's unlikely to see the former happen as well. This problem can be alleviated by an increase in transaction fees, but with usage down and BTC exposure increasingly coming through ETFs, that outcome seems to be a long shot at this point in time. Closing Summary I get it, a lot of these issues that I bring up in this article pertaining to mining economics are the same issues that I've mentioned in previous coverage of HUT and other mining stocks. But these are still very real headwinds. For a company that remains entirely reliant on paper Bitcoin gains for positive operating income numbers, I find it somewhat troubling that mining revenue is now being rolled into a segment with HPC. I might feel differently if the mining business was being sunset, but the company is planning to scale exahash capacity. Mining and Data Center Cloud are very different businesses, and I'd imagine keeping them separate offers analysts better insight into the company's true fundamentals. But more broadly, I'm of the view that 2025 is going to be a challenging year for the stock market and risk assets generally speaking. While I'm encouraged by Hut 8's ability to transform the business over the last year or two, the equity still goes as Bitcoin goes. And if given a choice between the two, investors will likely do much better just buying Bitcoin.",BTC-USD|HUT|HUT:CA,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|BTC|MINING|TRADING|MARKET,"{'name': 'Seeking Alpha', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/seekingalpha.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",seekingalpha,2025-03-16 09:04:50

The malicious actors falsely claimed that Kaito wallets had been compromised, urging users to sell their holdings or withdraw funds, a strategy designed to create panic in the market. According to blockchain investigator DeFi Warhol, the attackers opened short positions on KAITO tokens before making the false claims, intending to crash the price and profit from the decline. This form of market manipulation has become increasingly common in the crypto industry, where bad actors leverage social media exploits to trigger mass sell-offs. Following the breach, the Kaito AI team swiftly regained control of their account and reassured users that no wallets had been compromised. In an official statement, the team said: “We had high-standard security measures in place to prevent [the hack]—so it seems to be similar or the same as other recent Twitter account hacks.” Rising Wave of X Account Hack Cases The Kaito AI hack is just the latest in a string of high-profile social media breaches targeting crypto projects, influencers, and even public figures. Attackers frequently exploit social engineering tactics to gain access to accounts and manipulate market sentiment. On February 26, the X account of Pump.fun, a fair-launch token platform, was hijacked by a hacker promoting fraudulent tokens, including a fake governance token named “Pump.” Blockchain investigator ZackXBT later linked this attack to the Jupiter DAO and DogWifCoin X account compromises, suggesting an organized campaign targeting crypto-related profiles. Even celebrities have fallen victim to these tactics. In January, Dean Norris had his X account hacked to promote a scam memecoin called DEAN. Fake News and Phishing Scams Beyond direct account takeovers, scammers are now resorting to fake news campaigns to lure victims. On March 7, the Alberta Securities Commission warned the public about a crypto scam called CanCap, which used fake endorsements from Canadian politicians, including Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, to mislead investors. With social media becoming a battleground for crypto fraud, industry players and investors are urged to exercise extreme caution, double-check announcements, and verify sources before reacting to market-moving news.

According to United States prosecutors, the defendant, 30-year-old Kevin Segal, is facing about 141 and half years in prison after he scammed businesses in Wyoming out of approximately $212,000. According to United States police, Segal pretended to be a wealthy businessman trying to purchase real estate worth millions of dollars in the Jackson Hole area. United States authorities have now declared Segal wanted after he borrowed $50,000 from another individual, Jason Irvine, to pay his bond last month but failed to show up in court this week. According to reports, Irvine mentioned that Segal had promised to refund him with Bitcoin worth about $500K if he agreed to post the bond on his behalf. “He explained the situation and was denying all the charges written in the newspaper. He said it was libel and slander, and he didn’t intend to defraud anybody. He was locked up in jail, and said that’s why he couldn’t pay anybody off,” Irvine said. United States authorities declare California native wanted According to Irvine’s statement, he established that both of them were friends, noting that one of his family members had vouched for him. He added that he maxed out three of his credit cards to pay for the bond. After his bond was posted, Segal was released from prison in February, with the United States court giving a strict order for him to turn in his passport. A mugshot of the wanted Kevin Segal. Source: Daily Mail. However, Segal never turned in his passport, according to Park County District Court Judge Bill Simpson. The judge had to go on with a hearing on Wednesday because Segal failed to show up. The judge forfeited the $50,000 bond. His next bond has been placed at $750,000 cash only if he is eventually captured, with a bench warrant issued in over 50 states for his arrest because of his absence. In his statement, Irvine mentioned that he is now looking for options for filing for bankruptcy, hoping that the United States authorities will apprehend Segal soon. “You screwed me over, and now I don’t believe anything you say anymore. You’re a sociopath and a con man, and you’re going to get what you deserve,” Irvine said to him in a text. Authorities to intensify efforts to apprehend Segal United States authorities have confirmed that Segal’s whereabouts remain unknown, but they are intensifying efforts to apprehend him. “We don’t know his exact whereabouts right now. We want to bring him back here so we can have some type of restitution for all of our local victims. There were a lot of people, besides bigger companies, that have been affected,” Teton County Sheriff’s Sgt. John Fiacco said. During his trial in January, detective Adam Rainey testified, mentioning that he lied to people just to live a good life. “I believe that Mr. Segal just posed to be a Bitcoin billionaire and said this to everybody just to live the high life,” he said. The Teton County Sheriff’s Office started to look into Segal in May 2024, after a report from a car dealership in Jackson known as Rocky Mountain Yeti. The company claimed that Segal promised to wire $159,427 for a brand new 2024 Dodge Ram 3500 pickup truck, but the funds didn’t go through. It was discovered that Segal had been staying at the five-star hotel Caldera House but checked out six days before he took possession of the vehicle. According to an affidavit, Segal secretly left the hotel without paying $14,870 in several bills. Investigations also revealed that he was also a guest at the luxurious Amangani resort, where he stayed with his mother and friend. The hotel said he left without paying his outstanding $2,725 bill. Segal also went to Mangy Moose Saloon where he also racked up a bill worth $3,055 that went unpaid. He was also accused of deceiving several parties, including a man who was asked to pick up a drone. According to court documents, he had also been involved in a civil lawsuit after he lied to a family that he sold stocks worth $340 million and had a successful company in order to lease a property in Los Angeles. The lawsuit accused him of reversing wire transfers and paying for the leased property with phony checks. The case was finalized in September 2023 after a settlement between all parties.

Of the unlocked tokens, Ember CN says $205 million worth of LINK was sent directly to Binance, the world’s largest crypto exchange by trading volume. An additional $57 million worth of LINK was transferred to a separate multi-signature address. Says Ember CN, “Every three months, Chainlink’s non-circulating supply address will unlock about 10 to 20 million LINK. Most of them will be transferred directly to Binance, and a small part will be transferred to the 0xD50…8Af address (the LINK transferred to this address enters the LINK staking reward distribution contract and is used to distribute rewards to LINK staking users).

On the other hand, the presale sale of Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is progressing steadily, with Phase 3 closing fast and Phase 4 generating plenty of excitement. Over 5,700 holders and $3.4 million raised; Mutuum Finance is set to be a unique player in the DeFi sector. Mutuum Finance (MUTM): The New Face of DeFi Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is currently in Phase 3 of its presale, with tokens priced at $0.02. Additional benefits will allow investors to accrue a 25% jump in value once the price increases to $0.025, Phase 4. Such a pricing mechanism both rewards early participants in the project and makes sure that participants will be more qualified over time. MUTM is projected to have an opening price of 0.06 at launch, a 200% profit for current phase buyers. Tokenomics are structured in favour of long-term value generation. After launch, analysts forecast that MUTM could soar to $1.50, providing early adopters with a potential 7,400% return on investment (ROI). This forecast is enabled through Mutuum Finance’s pioneering lending approach, which integrates a buy-and-distribute model to establish continuous demand for the token. What Makes Mutuum Finance Unique Mutuum Finance devotes its efforts toward real-world application as an alternative to the many speculative token projects. By deploying mtTokens users obtain passive income through the decentralized lending and borrowing platform which accommodates ETH and DAI assets and other deposited assets. The collection of mtTokens generates continuous interest accumulation which creates supplementary earnings for those who hold them. Overcollateralized loans on the platform create stability for lenders and maintain high levels of liquidity through risk reduction. Mutuum Finance is bringing P2P (peer-to-peer) lending features to allow users direct loans terms negotiation. The platform offers flexibility through its lending model which encourages borrowers to obtain assets that traditional lending markets do not currently provide. Security and Transparency Lending platform Mutuum Finance has a smart contract audit ongoing by CertiK, an industry leader in Blockchain security. The results will be published on the project’s social media channels once they become available, enhancing the investor confidence. Such commitment to the security ensures that the team is serious in creating a reliable and trustworthy platform. Outlook on Solana (SOL): Bullish As all eyes fall on Mutuum Finance in the DeFi space, Solana (SOL) is also generating headlines. SOL has been experiencing lower lows for the last couple of weeks and a descending channel formed until recently when it dipped below $200 to reach some long-term price support and a significant and rare bullish pattern was formed. Thanks to scalability, less congestion and more daps being adopted, analysts forecast Solana will be worth $293.76 by the end of 2025. But with it’s innovative infrastructure and resilience have made Solana (SOL) a key player in the crypto market despite strong competition from other blockchain platforms. Much will depend on its price action over the next few weeks, with investors closely monitoring its movements. A Chance for Investors That is Rare The preorder for Mutuum Finance tokens through the presale reaches its completion point very soon as Phase 3 nears an end. Solana investors looking to spread their portfolio can find rare value during this period since MUTM tokens sell at $0.02. Early investors will enjoy the Phase 4 price rise and the projected market increase that follows the product launch. Mutuum Finance brings revolutionary decentralized finance to crypto space together with Solana’s growing upswing to create an exciting future. Investors need to move quickly because both Solana’s potential growth and Mutuum Finance’s practical use remain compelling options. Don’t Miss Out The presale event of Mutuum Finance provides investors with a rare opportunity to participate early in a project having sound basic structure together with enormous market potential. Phase 3 is filling up quickly and it brings forth potential substantial token returns but for only a brief period. The team will provide continuous information about the smart contract audit while anticipating the upcoming exciting developments.

Unlike decentralized cryptocurrencies, XRP is backed by a single company and aims to be a bridge currency for global transactions rather than an alternative to fiat. I’ve seen XRP price go through wild swings, often driven more by court rulings than market trends. While some investors wait for the next big decision, others are looking for a smarter way to invest - and that’s where Dawgz AI comes in. With AI-powered trade bots, Dawgz AI ensures you’re not just betting on legal outcomes - you’re making profitable moves 24/7. XRP Current Market Overview XRP, introduced by Ripple Labs in 2012, is a digital currency designed to facilitate quick and affordable cross-border payments. Unlike many cryptocurrencies, XRP isn't decentralized; it's managed by a single company. Its primary goal is to act as a bridge currency, enabling seamless transactions between different forms of value, such as converting Bitcoin to euros or other fiat currencies. XRP operates on the XRP Ledger, which uses the Ripple Protocol Consensus Algorithm to validate transactions efficiently without relying on mining. Current XRP price: $2.23 Market Capitalization: $129.87 billion on CoinMarketCap XRP Ledger adoption continues to grow, increasing transaction volume and liquidity** These figures highlight XRP’s significant presence in the entire crypto market, proving its staying power despite legal battles. Fun Fact: The Ripple Network can process transactions in 3-5 seconds, making it significantly faster than Bitcoin or Ethereum, which can take minutes or even hours. XRP Price Prediction for 2025 Predicting XRP price in 2025 involves considering various factors, including regulatory developments, adoption rates, and technological advancements. So what is XRP price prediction 2025? Factors Influencing XRP’s 2025 Price Regulatory Environment – The outcome of Ripple’s legal challenges, particularly with the SEC, will significantly impact investor confidence and XRP adoption. Adoption by Financial Institutions – Ripple Labs’ success in partnering with banks and financial entities can drive demand for XRP, potentially boosting its value. Technological Developments – Enhancements to the XRP Ledger that improve transaction speed, security, and scalability could make XRP more attractive to users and investors. Price Prediction Table for 2025 Scenario Price Prediction Bearish Case $1.50 - $2.00 Neutral Case $2.00 - $3.00 Bullish Case $3.00 - $5.00 For a better visual understanding of XRP’s past performance, analyzing a price chart can help investors track historical trends and potential future movements in the market. While XRP predictions vary, long-term investors are hopeful about Ripple Labs’ ongoing expansion and legal clarity. XRP Price Prediction for 2026-2030 Looking beyond 2025 , Ripple XRP price prediction will depend on its integration into the global financial system and its ability to adapt to evolving market needs. Key Factors for 2026-2030 Global Economic Conditions – Economic stability and growth can influence investment in cryptocurrencies, including XRP. Competition – Emerging digital payment solutions and central bank digital currencies (CBDCs) could impact XRP’s market share. Technological Innovation – Continuous improvements and new features in the XRP Ledger could enhance XRP’s utility and appeal. XRP Price Prediction Table for 2026-2030 Year Price Prediction 2026 $3.50 - $5.50 2027 $4.00 - $6.00 2028 $4.50 - $7.00 2029 $5.00 - $8.00 2030 $5.50 - $10.00 The average price during this period will likely be influenced by how well Ripple Labs expands XRP’s use cases and integrates it into global financial markets. XRP Price Prediction Beyond 2030 In the long term , XRP’s value will be influenced by its ability to maintain relevance and adapt to future financial ecosystems. Long-Term Influencing Factors Mainstream Adoption – If XRP becomes widely used for everyday transactions, its price prediction could see massive growth. Technological Resilience – The XRP Ledger must continue to evolve to remain competitive with emerging blockchain solutions. Regulatory Landscape – A clearer global regulatory framework for crypto assets will play a major role in XRP’s long-term success. The Ripple Network will play a crucial role in shaping XRP’s future, as its infrastructure improvements and global banking integrations could lead to wider adoption and increased demand for the token. Long-Term XRP Crypto Price Prediction Table Scenario Price Prediction Bearish Case $5.00 - $7.00 Neutral Case $7.00 - $10.00 Bullish Case $10.00 - $15.00 Some analysts wonder, ""Could XRP hit $20?"" While it’s not impossible, it would require massive adoption, widespread institutional use, and regulatory clarity. Dawgz AI vs. XRP: Is $DAGZ a Better Alternative? While XRP focuses on revolutionizing cross-border payments, Dawgz AI introduces a novel approach by integrating artificial intelligence with cryptocurrency trading. Why Dawgz AI Stands Out AI-Powered Trading Bots – $DAGZ operates 24/7, scanning the market and executing high-probability trades, ensuring consistent returns instead of waiting for price swings. Staking Rewards – Unlike XRP, which depends on market appreciation, Dawgz AI lets ETH holders earn passive income through staking rewards with competitive APY. Strong Tokenomics – Dawgz AI’s 8.888 billion token supply follows a structured distribution model, ensuring long-term stability. Presale Momentum – Over $2.6 million raised, with the next target at $3.08 million, signaling strong investor demand and an impending price increase. For those seeking real returns and a hedge against crypto market volatility , Dawgz AI offers a more dynamic and profitable investment. It combines the excitement of meme coins with advanced trading technology, making it a top choice for forward-thinking investors. The key question is: Will Dawgz AI outperform XRP as an investment in 2025? Which Coin Will Boom in the Future? The next crypto boom will depend on market trends, adoption, and real-world utility. While many investors are drawn to XRP due to its banking partnerships and cross-border payment solutions, its future remains uncertain because of regulatory hurdles. On the other hand, Dawgz AI is emerging as a strong contender. Unlike XRP, which relies on institutional adoption, $DAGZ is built for everyday investors, offering AI-powered trading bots, passive income through staking, and strong tokenomics. With over $2.6 million raised and growing investor interest, Dawgz AI is positioned for long-term growth, making it a high-potential project for the future crypto boom. Conclusion XRP price predictions remain a hot topic, especially with Ripple Labs’ ongoing legal battles and institutional partnerships. Its future valuation depends on regulatory clarity, adoption, and technological improvements to the XRP Ledger. I’ve followed crypto trends for years, and I’ve seen how regulatory uncertainty can stall a coin’s growth. However, Dawgz AI provides a different kind of investment opportunity - one that doesn’t rely on banking adoption or legal outcomes. With AI-powered trading, staking rewards, and strong tokenomics, Dawgz AI stands out as a profitable and innovative investment choice. For those looking beyond traditional crypto speculation , Dawgz AI’s combination of AI and trading strategies makes it a standout contender for the future. Frequently Asked Questions What is the price prediction of XRP in 2025? XRP’s price prediction for 2025 depends on regulatory clarity, adoption by financial institutions, and technological developments in the XRP Ledger. Based on price history, analysts estimate that XRP could trade between $1.50 and $5.00. The average price is expected to range between $2.00 and $3.00, depending on market trends and investor confidence. How much will 1 XRP be worth in 2030? By 2030, if XRP adoption continues and international transactions increase, XRP could reach $10-$15, with some projections suggesting a bullish case of $20. Its market cap will be a key factor, as greater demand and financial partnerships could push its valuation higher. The average price during this period will depend on global economic conditions and competition from other blockchain solutions. Is XRP expected to skyrocket? XRP has the potential for significant price increases, but whether it will skyrocket depends on factors like legal victories, mainstream adoption, and XRP Ledger advancements. However, investors should monitor its price history and global regulations before making predictions. Can XRP reach $50? For XRP to hit $50, its market cap would need to grow exponentially, surpassing many of the largest cryptocurrencies. While possible in an extremely bullish scenario, it would require massive adoption for international transactions, institutional backing, and a drastic reduction in circulating supply. Based on current projections, XRP is more likely to stay in the $10-$15 range by 2030 unless unexpected catalysts drive its price higher.

And with the US Securities and Exchange Commission vs Ripple case nearing its resolution, the market can expect more price volatility for this digital asset. Related Reading: 200 Million XRP On The Move—Is Ripple Preparing For A Big Play? Within this context, market analyst Ali Martinez boldly claims that Ripple’s native coin still have the legs to hit a two-digit figure this cycle, using an extensive symmetrical triangle formation as a solid basis. Martinez’s view runs opposite the bearish statements from other commentators. XRP has been on a slide lately, affected by the broader crypto fall, dipping by around 25% from its $3.40 high achieved mid-January. XRP Gradually Builds Its Symmetrical Triangle Like most cryptos, XRP continues to have a highly volatile market performance. The token attempted a recovery early this month but met resistance, leading to a steep decline on March 11th. Interestingly, a few commentators remain bullish on the altcoin, including Martinez, who sees the token on track to reach $15. This is why $XRP can still reach $15! pic.twitter.com/vkIiR0rnpU — Ali (@ali_charts) March 14, 2025 In his latest commentary, shared via a Twitter/X posting, Martinez highlighted the seven-year symmetrical triangle formed by this asset, which dates back to January 2018, when it dropped from its $3.80 high. Even before Martinez shared this observation, several commentators reported the triangle’s formation, suggesting that a breakout could lead to a price run. The Ascending Trendline According to Martinez, XRP formed its lower highs in January 2018, extending the descending trendline on top. As the crypto witnessed higher lows during this time frame, it extended its ascending trendline below, creating a symmetrical triangle. Interestingly, XRP exited the symmetrical triangle structure following the November US elections. Ripple’s native token surged by 280% for the month, marking the biggest 30-day increase for the asset in seven years. Along with surprising traders, this breakout inspired fresh hope among XRP enthusiasts. While some experts noted that past breakouts do not automatically ensure continuous rallies, many saw this spike as evidence of possible long-term strength. Still, the dramatic price fluctuation sparked conversations on XRP’s future, particularly in light of further government changes and more general market movements. Ripple’s XRP is currently trading at $2.37, which is 2% up in the last seven days. Related Reading: TRUMP Token Takedown—Did Insiders Plan The Crash?

He also suggested that even if XRP slips below $2, it’s still on track for a breakout, as long as it stays above $1. Armed with the charts, Martinez believes that XRP hitting $15 is not a far-out idea.

Although it managed to defend that level at first and bounced off to $84,000, the bears kept the pressure on and it lost it on Tuesday. At the time, the cryptocurrency plunged to a four-month low of under $77,000. The bulls finally intercepted the move and didn’t allow another price breakdown. In fact, BTC jumped above $80,000 and spiked to $84,000 on Thursday. It was first stopped there despite the favorable US CPI data for February. Nevertheless, it shot up on Friday and jumped past $85,000 for the first time since the previous weekend. It has lost some ground since then, and it trades at around $84,000 for most of the weekend.

The operational volatility from new emerging interest declines, along with competing blockchain projects and fierce competition, places SHIB's holders at risk. Meanwhile, smart investors are eyeing Rexas Finance (RXS), a next-gen crypto business that will change tokenization. Rexas Finance's real-world asset (RWA) tokenization model and DeFi integration offer a 21,670% ROI, surpassing SHIB's speculative gains. Given the shift toward utility-driven initiatives, could RXS be a game-changer? The future of Shiba Inu (SHIB) is uncertain. The Shiba Inu (SHIB) token's meme-centric appeal attracts crypto consumers, but hitting $0.000081 is difficult. SHIB has a solid token community and experiences price spikes but is still plagued by the volatility of the market, the over-circulation of tokens, and the increasing adoption of utility tokens. As investors doubt SHIB can yield exponential profits, they are looking to emerging projects with real-world applications, such as Rexas Finance. Rexas Finance (RXS): Blockchain's Next Frontier Rexas Finance (RXS) is leading the blockchain revolution with a comprehensive RWA tokenization platform. This novel technology allows investors to fractionalize real estate, commodities, and art into digital tokens, expanding their financial options. Rexas Finance uses blockchain and traditional asset classes to make asset management and trading transparent, efficient, and decentralized. The Token Builder and QuickMint Bot in Rexas Finance's advanced ecosystem simplify tokenization. These features let non-technical users develop, manage, and exchange tokenized assets. Additionally, the platform's AI-driven security solutions, such as the Rexas AI Shield, protect transactions from fraud and boost investor confidence. Decentralized Finance (DeFi) Power in Rexas Finance Rexas Finance pioneered RWA tokenization and integrated Decentralized Finance (DeFi) techniques to improve yield farming and staking. DeFi methods allow investors to create passive income, increasing their returns. This multi-faceted strategy makes Rexas Finance a more sustainable and enticing investment than speculative meme coins like SHIB. Rexas Finance's Unmatched Growth & Presale Success TSince its commencement in September, theRexas Finance presale has been a success It has become one of the most crypto-valued presales. The initiative raised $46.6 million in Stage 12 by selling 453 million tokens at rising prices. Investor confidence and increasing demand have driven RXS' 600% rise from $0.03 to $0.20. Unlike many cryptocurrency projects that use venture finance, Rexas Finance used a public presale. This deliberate choice prevents venture capitalist-led token dumping and ensures price stability and distribution. This honest and community-focused approach has earned Rexas Finance the trust of retail and institutional investors. Rexas Finance (RXS) Gains Market Credibility Rexas Finance's early listings on CoinMarketCap and CoinGecko let worldwide investors monitor its progress. The project has passed a Certik audit, demonstrating its security and openness. These accomplishments distinguish Rexas Finance from meme coins by making it a reliable and high-potential investment. Scarcity and deflation fuel long-term price appreciation Rexas Finance’s tokenomics promotes long-term price appreciation through deflation. The project's revolutionary scarcity mechanism gradually reduces the token supply, raising its value. The ongoing $1 million raffle campaign, where 20 winners will receive $50,000 in Rexas Finance, has also increased community engagement and enthusiasm. This approach rewards early adopters and expands the project's reach, enticing new funders. Major Exchange Listings and Price Forecasts After the presale, at least three of the top ten cryptocurrency exchanges will list RXS at $0.25. These listings will increase market liquidity and expose RXS to more investors. Analysts expect Rexas Finance to rise 21670% because of its rapid adoption and strong market fundamentals, making it one of the most attractive crypto investments. Growing RWA Tokenization Market: $16 Trillion Opportunity Real-world asset (RWA) tokenization is expected to expand from $50 billion in 2025 to $16 trillion by 2030. Rexas Finance might gain a lot of market share from this exponential growth. Rexas Finance leads this high-growth market as traditional investors seek blockchain-based asset ownership and trading solutions. Why Investors Are Leaving Shiba Inu for Rexas Finance SHIB is a popular meme coin, but its lack of inherent value and utility makes it a risky long-term investment. In contrast, Rexas Finance has a strong blockchain infrastructure, new DeFi solutions, and a growing RWA tokenization market. Rexas Finance has huge potential, thus investors seeking 21670% ROI are strategically moving their portfolios. Key Reasons RXS Outperforms SHIB: Rexas Finance offers real-world investing opportunities through RWA tokenization, unlike SHIB, which relies on speculation. Rexas Finance has grown 600% since debut, indicating significant demand and investor trust. Rexas Finance is a trustworthy investment after passing a Certik assessment and incorporating AI-driven security solutions. Rexas Finance allows staking and yield farming, allowing investors numerous revenue streams. Rexas Finance scarcity model promotes long-term price appreciation, unlike SHIB's oversupply. High-profile listings may boost Rexas Finance prices by increasing liquidity and market visibility. Utility-driven crypto is the future As meme coins struggle with market saturation and utility concerns, Shiba Inu's (SHIB) rise to $0.000081 remains uncertain and uphill. Rexas Finance (RXS), a blockchain technology powerhouse, transforms finance with a real-world asset tokenization platform. Due to its great presale record, investor trust, and expanding acceptance, Rexas Finance offers an unmatched chance for 21670% ROI.

Investor Sparks BTC Backlash: Details,https://thecoinrise.com/better-bitcoin-investor-sparks-btc-backlash-details/,"Jason Calacanis, a well-known angel investor who was an early backer of Uber, has ignited a heated debate in the Bitcoin community by suggesting that the world’s largest cryptocurrency is destined to be replaced. On March 14, Calacanis told his nearly one million followers on X that Bitcoin’s dominance will not last forever, stating : “Bitcoin has been a wonderful game, but with a couple of giant players cornering the market, the timing is right to ‘build a better Bitcoin’—restarting the game.” His remarks were met with immediate resistance from Bitcoin advocates , who argued that Bitcoin is not just another technology to be discarded and replaced. While Calacanis, an early investor in Robinhood and Bitcoin startup Keza, insisted that all technology eventually becomes obsolete, industry leaders pushed back, highlighting Bitcoin’s unique position in the financial ecosystem. The Future Lies in BTC Layer-2 Solutions Prominent voices within the Bitcoin community responded forcefully, explaining that while Bitcoin itself is irreplaceable, innovation can still happen on top of it. “Winning protocols don’t get replaced; they are built upon,” said Brady Swenson, co-founder of Swan Bitcoin, arguing that the race is still open for a dominant layer-2 protocol to take Bitcoin to the next level. Similarly, Cory Klippsten, another Swan Bitcoin co-founder, dismissed the idea of a “better Bitcoin,” calling it a technological revolution that transcends traditional innovation cycles. Lightspark CEO David Marcus echoed this view, stating : “Trying to build a better Bitcoin is a fool’s errand. What it lacks in functionality can be built on L2s.” Others, like ShapeShift CEO Eric Voorhees, suggested that Bitcoin’s limitations can be addressed by other blockchains, rather than requiring a full replacement. No Better Bitcoin? Bitcoin’s longevity and security are what make it increasingly difficult to replace, according to several analysts. Wayne Vaughan, a strong advocate for BTC, explained that many misunderstand Bitcoin’s true nature: “People wrongly assume Bitcoin is just an asset, application, or platform. I think of Bitcoin as a network. The larger the network gets, the less likely it is for something else to replace it.” Similarly, Matt Cole, CEO of Strive Funds, stated bluntly: “There will not be a better Bitcoin.” Despite the controversy, this is not Calacanis’ first run-in with the crypto industry . In 2020, he criticized the space by claiming that most crypto projects were run by “unqualified idiots” and “grifters.” The post Better Bitcoin?

Meanwhile, XRP struggled to surpass its 2017 all-time highs of $3.84 despite market optimism. Fast-forward to 2025, and Rexas Finance (RXS) is generating similar excitement. Surging 580% from its initial presale price of $0.03 to $0.20 in its final stage, RXS is dominating conversations as a real-world asset tokenization pioneer. With $46.8 million raised and a confirmed $0.25 listing price, analysts project a climb to $10+ post-launch. This positions RXS as a potential giant-killer, ready to eclipse underperformers like XRP through its revolutionary blockchain solutions. Rexas Finance Bridges Real-World Assets and Blockchain Rexas Finance is redefining ownership by tokenizing real estate, gold, and other physical assets. The global real estate market alone exceeds $300 trillion, while gold and commodities add trillions more. By converting these assets into tokens, Rexas lets anyone own a fraction of a Paris apartment or a Dubai skyscraper with a single click. A farmer in Kenya can now earn passive income from a Tokyo office building, while a student in Brazil invests in Swiss gold bars. This system eliminates geographical barriers, democratizing access to high-value opportunities once reserved for the wealthy. The platform’s ERC-20 token, RXS, powers this ecosystem. Users tokenize assets through the Rexas Token Builder, a tool simplifying the conversion of physical holdings into tradeable digital tokens. Creators then list these tokens on the Rexas Launchpad, attracting global investors to fund projects ranging from vineyards to solar farms. With the Quickmint Bot streamlining token creation and AI Shield securing transactions, Rexas is erasing the line between traditional finance and blockchain innovation. RXS Presale Dominance and Strategic Tokenomics Rexas Finance has opted for a community-centric approach, bypassing venture capital to let everyday investors lead its presale. Stages 1-11 sold out rapidly, raising $41 million as demand outpaced supply. The current Stage 12 has already sold 90.8% of its 500 million RXS allocation, pushing the price to $0.20, a 6.6x leap from Stage 1. With the presale nearing its $56 million target, the clock is ticking for latecomers. Token distribution emphasizes sustainability: 50% for presale backers, 22.5% for staking rewards, and 15% locked as liquidity. This structure balances immediate accessibility with long-term growth, backed by a CertiK audit ensuring airtight security. Rexas further cements trust through listings on CoinMarketCap and CoinGecko, platforms frequented by 100 million monthly users. Plans to debut on three top-tier exchanges post-launch will amplify visibility, driving liquidity and adoption. Rexas Millionaire Giveaway and Market Momentum To celebrate its ascent, Rexas is distributing $1 million to 20 winners via its ongoing giveaway. Participants submit ERC-20 wallet addresses, complete tasks, and refer friends to boost entries. This campaign has drawn 1.2 million entries, widening Rexas’ reach while rewarding early supporters. Combined with AI-driven tools like GenAI for market predictions, the project is crafting a loyal community poised to fuel its post-launch surge. Market analysts highlight RXS’s $0.25 launch price as a springboard. Conservative estimates suggest a rise to $7, while bullish forecasts see $10+ as adoption accelerates. Early investors buying at $0.20 could see 50x returns, mirroring Solana’s historic run. With real-world asset tokenization projected to grow 1,000% by 2030, Rexas sits at the intersection of blockchain utility and trillion-dollar markets. Conclusion Solana’s 2021 rally and XRP’s stagnation highlight crypto’s unpredictable nature. Rexas Finance (RXS) is emerging as a 2025 standout, merging real-world value with blockchain efficiency. Its presale dominance, $1 million giveaway, and CertiK-audited framework make it a magnet for investors seeking the next explosive opportunity. As the final presale stage closes, the window to join this revolution is narrowing. For those eyeing Solana-level gains, RXS offers a compelling proposition: transform modest investments into generational wealth by bridging the physical and digital worlds.

Experts believe that by 2025, Ripple (XRP) will outperform Ethereum (ETH). From an SEC litigation almost under resolution to a possible XRP spot ETF, multiple elements are pointing to XRP as the better option this year. Here’s why. XRP vs. Ethereum: Current Market Position The recent announcement of Donald Trump’s strategic crypto reserve resparked market momentum. Ethereum is worth $2,130, about $256.84 billion, and XRP is worth $2.33, about $135.42 billion. XRP's price has increased 316% in the last four months. Ethereum has dropped 25% in the same period. Multiple positive catalysts—including regulatory clarity, ETF potential, and rising financial industry adoption—drive XRP's explosive climb. XRP’s SEC Case is Finally Ending: A Regulatory Green Light Ripple's long legal struggle with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is finally ending. The lawsuit, which started in 2020, kept institutional investors away. As regulatory uncertainty fades, XRP is primed for a surge in institutional investment. Gary Gensler's exit is regarded as a win for XRP. The crypto sector is keenly anticipating the announcement of Paul Atkins as the crypto-friendly Gensler’s successor. Analysts such as Javon Marks foresee a massive post-case breakout, which may propel XRP over $10 in the coming weeks. 2. XRP ETF Approval: Institutional Demand Set to Skyrocket The world of cryptocurrency ETFs is rapidly evolving. While Ethereum's ETF struggled with inflows, experts predict XRP ETFs will follow Bitcoin's lead, resulting in a big rise. Bitwise, WisdomTree, and 21Shares have already filed applications for XRP ETFs. Polymarket predicts a 70% chance of an XRP ETF approval in 2025, while BlackRock and Fidelity are said to be looking into XRP-based ETFs. Unlike Ethereum, which has scalability and gas tax difficulties, XRP's quick, low-cost transactions make it a great candidate for institutional adoption. If XRP ETFs become allowed, billions in institutional capital will be anticipated to stream in, pushing prices substantially higher. 3. XRP’s Growing Utility and Banking Adoption Another reason XRP is distinct from Ethereum is its real-world acceptance. Bank of America currently uses XRP to handle all internal transactions. Ripple’s new RLUSD stablecoin, running on the XRP Ledger, extends application cases. Standard Chartered is integrating XRP into its digital asset programs. While Ethereum rules DeFi and NFTs, XRP shines in institutional finance and cross-border transactions. Thanks to its strong banking support, XRP has a long-term edge over Ethereum's ecosystem. Rexas Finance (RXS): The Next Big Crypto Investment XRP rules institutional finance; another major revolution in real-world asset (RWA) tokenization is underway under Rexas Finance (RXS) . Historically, traditional high-value assets, including fine art, commodities, and real estate, have been illiquid and reserved for the wealthy. Rexas Finance removes this barrier by tokenizing assets, which allows individual investors to own fractions of properties, gold reserves, and other assets. For instance, an investor may pay just $100 for a slice of a $10 million real estate portfolio—unfeasible in conventional markets. Through AI-powered tokenization, cross-chain DeFi staking, and rapid liquidity pools, Rexas creates a whole new investment paradigm. Wall Street behemoths such as BlackRock, JPMorgan, and Goldman Sachs are extensively investing in RWA tokenization. Analysts predict that the RWA sector, one of the fastest-growing blockchain subjects, will reach a valuation of $30 trillion by 2030. With its innovative DeFi tools and AI-driven security checks, Rexas Finance will likely take a sizable market share and become the most well-known name in tokenized RWAs. Rexas Finance has shown an astounding presale increase since its September 2024 launch. As of this writing, the presale started at $0.03 and has already increased to $0.20, a 567% increase—sales of 455 million tokens brought in $47.1 million. With 91% sold out in the last presale level (level 12), investor interest is substantial. Rexas Finance (RXS) is slated to make its debut on at least three of the world's top ten exchanges on June 19, 2025. The listing price has been verified at $0.25, with post-launch increases of 100,000% expected due to significant liquidity inflows and a listing surge. Exchange listings provide greater reach, price stability, and institutional demand, positioning RXS for a solid start. Rexas Finance rewards early investors with a $1 million prize, with the top 20 participants receiving $50,000 in RXS. The incentive increases investor trust and promotes FOMO, making Rexas Finance one of the hottest investment options in 2025. Conclusion: XRP and RXS Are Investments to Watch in 2025 XRP is clearly a better investment than Ethereum since it is expected to expand significantly depending on the settlement of an SEC case, possible ETF clearance, and banking acceptance. Rexas Finance is transforming RWA tokenization and simultaneously presenting investors with a once-in-a-lifetime chance. Rexas Finance recently reached 50,000 active holders, and investors rush to get RXS before the final stage sells out. Don't miss out on this historic presale—invest in Rexas Finance today before it makes its spectacular exchange debut on June 19!

Speaking to The Sunday Times , Luis said, “We need to consider the uncertainty of the current environment, which is even higher than it was during the pandemic.” Luis made it clear that the new U.S. administration is not interested in multilateralism—the global cooperation that kept economies somewhat stable during the last crisis. “What we’re seeing is that the new US administration isn’t very open to continuing with multilateralism, which is about cooperation across jurisdictions and finding common solutions for common problems. This is a very important change, and a big source of uncertainty.” Trade war threats disrupt global markets With Trump refusing to work with international partners, central banks are struggling to predict inflation, growth, and interest rate movements. ECB President Christine Lagarde warned last Wednesday that a trade war with China, Canada, and the European Union will definitely hurt the global economy, but did she even have to? Meanwhile, Jose Luis Escriva, speaking to Bloomberg TV , said inflation and economic growth are now impossible to predict because of the volatile policies coming from Washington. ECB forecasts show the eurozone’s growth at just 0.9% this year, reflecting widespread economic stagnation. Consumer confidence is dropping. Luis said, “Real wages have increased, inflation is declining, interest rates are coming down and financing conditions are better. But still, the reality is that consumption is not picking up.” People are holding back on spending, worried about what’s coming next. “They also consider what might happen with the economy over the medium term, which is clouded in uncertainty. The possibility of a trade war or wider geopolitical conflict has an impact on consumer confidence.” ECB vice-president Luis de Guindos addresses the audience during the ECB Governing Council Press Conference on 11 April, 2024, Frankfurt, Germany. Photo by: Angela Morant/ECB. Source: ECB. Meanwhile, European governments are spending more on defense, but the long-term effects are unclear. Luis acknowledged that the spending might boost economic growth, but added, “It will likely be positive for growth and have a limited impact on inflation.” Central banks hold rates as uncertainty dominates Central banks worldwide are on edge, waiting to see the full impact of Trump’s policies. The Federal Reserve is expected to keep rates steady at its next meeting, but markets are looking for signals from Chair Jerome Powell. Investors predict two rate cuts this year, starting in September, but Powell has said, “The Fed doesn’t need to be in a hurry to cut rates.” At the same time, Wall Street market volatility, weak growth, and declining consumer confidence are raising concerns about a possible recession. Trump’s trade war is making things worse, and the Fed is unsure if it should step in. The Bank of Japan is also expected to hold rates steady as it assesses the impact of its January rate hike. Inflation and yen weakness are still major concerns, and economists are split on whether a rate increase will come in May or July. Other central banks are taking a cautious approach. Indonesia is expected to keep interest rates unchanged as it tries to prevent capital outflows. In China, banks are likely to hold the 1-year and 5-year loan prime rates steady, as authorities wait for more economic data. Taiwan’s central bank is also set to keep rates at 2% for a fourth straight meeting. The Bank of England is another institution playing it safe. Rates are likely to stay at 4.5%, even after a surprise GDP contraction. With geopolitical tensions, inflation concerns, and uncertainty over the Labour government’s budget, policymakers are hesitant to cut rates too soon. Some members of the Monetary Policy Committee support immediate cuts, but others want to wait. The Bank of Russia is also feeling the effects. Inflation surged past 10% in February, and interest rates remain at a record 21%. Officials are expected to keep rates high for now. In Argentina, Trump’s policies are complicating things further. Since taking office in December 2023, President Javier Milei has cut interest rates 10 times, with another cut likely this week. His aggressive strategy is aimed at slowing inflation, but the long-term effects are still quite unclear. Cryptopolitan Academy: Want to grow your money in 2025?

Toncoin ( TON ) rose to a high of $3.6240 on Saturday, its highest level since Feb. 24, bringing its market cap to over $8.4 billion. Pavel Durov leaves France The surge happened in part because of the ongoing crypto prices rebound and after French authorities gave Durov his passport, allowing him the freedom to leave the country. https://twitter.com/ton_blockchain/status/1900923518281543959?s=46 Durov was arrested in 2024 in France and was accused of several crimes, including complicity in managing an online platform that enabled illegal transactions. Allegations include refusal to cooperate with authorities, drug trafficking and money laundering. Following Durov’s arrest, many in the crypto community rallied in his defense. You might also like: Telegram founder Pavel Durov temporarily leaves France amid legal troubles, Toncoin surges Still, there are risks that the Toncoin price surge may be short-lived because of its fairly weak on-chain metrics. Data compiled by TonStat shows that the TON inflation has continued rising and currently stands at 0.40%, up from 0.33% in October. This inflation has jumped as the total supply has surged to over 5.124 billion. More data shows that the number of transactions per day crashed to 2.15 million from almost 20 million in September last year. TON transactions per day | Source: Tonstat The number of active wallets in the TON Blockchain has continued to drop. Also, the total value locked in its DeFi ecosystem has dropped to $180 million from almost $800 million a few months ago. STON.fi, its biggest DEX network, has a small market share, handling $7.1 million in the last 24 hours. One reason for this performance is that most tokens in the TON Blockchain, like Hamster Kombat ( HMSTR ), Catizen ( CATI ) and Tapswap, have crashed — erasing billions of dollars in value. The Toncoin price may also drop as investors sell the Durov release news. Historically, traders initially overreact to major news and then sell after a while. Recall when Cardano’s price rose after being named one of the tokens included in President Trump’s stockpile (the coin tumbled by double digits a few days later). Toncoin price analysis TON price chart | Source: crypto.news The daily chart shows that the TON price has bounced back after bottoming at $2.3650 this month. It rose to a high of $3.50, which coincided with the 50-day moving average, a sign that it has found substantial resistance. Toncoin price also found resistance at the weak, stop and reverse point of the Murrey Math Lines. Therefore, the token will likely resume the downtrend and move below $3 as the Durov news starts to fade.

While gold has risen to $3,000 an ounce, Bitcoin has been more volatile than tech stocks, falling along with the Nasdaq. But BitMEX founder and Maelstrom CIO Arthur Hayes seems unimpressed. He sees the current Bitcoin correction as a temporary liquidity crunch and expects a sharp recovery when market conditions change. Hayes predicts that Bitcoin could hit $250,000 by the end of the year. “We are experiencing a period of low liquidity fiat money production,” Hayes said in a recent interview with Bitcoin News’ David Sencil, suggesting that Trump-affiliated interests may be stoking recession fears in order to pressure the Fed into taking action. Related News: Trader Who Bought the Altcoin Mentioned by Binance Founder CZ Two Days Ago Made an Enormous Profit! The end result, Hayes said, will be a return to aggressive quantitative easing. “They’re going to print more money than anyone has ever printed before and they’re going to re-inflate it,” he predicted. Despite the recent volatility, Hayes expects Bitcoin to bottom before stocks, citing historical liquidity cycles. “We had a big rally from $20,000 to $110,000 and now we’re in a 30% correction. That’s pretty normal for a bull market,” he said. He believes the Fed will eventually step in to stabilize markets and trigger Bitcoin’s next big rally. “When there’s financial distress, they always print money. It doesn’t matter what the political leanings are,” he said. The key metric to watch, Hayes said, is not Bitcoin’s price but the return of liquidity. “When the floodgates open, it’s time to act,” he said. *This is not investment advice.

Trump accused South Korea of imposing “4x higher tariffs” than the United States. Trade Minister Cheong In-kyo met U.S. Trade Representative Jamieson Greer during his visit to Washington this week and emphasized that South Korea should not receive unfavorable treatment. South Korea’s acting president, Choi Sang-mok, ordered the government to communicate more actively with the U.S. administration to resolve any misunderstanding over tariffs. He had earlier said Trump’s America-first policies targeted Seoul. South Korea seeks U.S. tariff exemption Earlier this month, President Trump singled out South Korea for allegedly applying tariffs up to four times higher than those of the United States. However, the South Korean government rebutted Trump’s claim that Korea imposed “4x higher tariffs” than the United States. South Korea’s Trade Ministry stressed that “facts differed” and that under the 2007 FTA, most goods traded duty-free with an average tariff on U.S. imports of just 0.79%, dropping to 0% for industrial products. According to a statement released by the Korean Trade Ministry, South Korea’ s effective tariff rate on U.S. imports stood at 0.79% as the two countries have a free trade pact. Reportedly, what was 4x higher was Korea’s general WTO (most-favored-nation) tariff rate (13.4%) compared to America’s (3.3%). Trump’s claim overlooked that South Korea has FTAs with most trading nations, meaning that the higher general rate is rarely applied in practice. “Both sides shared the view that they will continue discussions to seek constructive and mutually beneficial progress on tariff and non-tariff measures in the future.” ~ South Korea Trade Ministry The Trade Ministry explained that South Korea imposed “virtually no tariffs on the US” and dispelled any misunderstandings through various channels, including the local embassy, recently established working-level consultative bodies, and high-level contacts, such as the Trade Minister’s recent US visit. Lutnick says tariffs on vehicles from all countries are fair On March 14, U.S. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick hinted that next month’s U.S. tariffs could be imposed on cars from all countries, including Korea, Japan and Germany. He added that this was fair, saying, “If you’re going to tariff cars from anywhere, it’s got to be tariffing cars from everywhere.” Last week, the Trump administration delayed new tariffs on automobiles imported from Mexico and Canada for one month. However, during his visit, Trade Minister Jeong also met with Senator Andy Kim (D-NJ)–the first Korean American to serve in the U.S. Senate–to discuss ways to deepen bilateral cooperation. He also engaged with experts from the Hudson Institute and law firms to gather insights on the Trump administration’s trade policies and potential strategies for strengthening industrial collaboration. Jeong further held talks with South Korean steel industry representatives operating in the U.S. to discuss response strategies and ways to minimize the impact of the 25% tariffs on steel and aluminum that took effect on March 12. Jeong said the meetings he attended during his visit were “a crucial first step.” He added that both countries will jointly build on the trust established through these discussions to ensure that Korea’s interests are fully reflected in upcoming trade decisions, prioritizing the maximization of national interests. Korea’s Industry Minister Ahn Duk-Geun also convened a meeting with business leaders On March 13 and discussed ways to beef up their joint response to U.S. tariffs. He urged companies to actively reach out to U.S. stakeholders and share details of their discussions with the government in real time. The Ministry of Trade also said in a statement that, based on the successful meetings, South Korea’s government will develop a plan to counter unfair imports.

Backed by solid fundamentals and a well-defined DeFi strategy, one emerging token is capturing investor interest by promising a 42x boost from its presale price. As its ecosystem expands and market demand accelerates, this crypto offers both stability and a compelling path to strong returns. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Mutuum Finance (MUTM) stands out as a major contender for those looking for both immediate gains and long-term value. Priced at only $0.02 during its presale, the project has already raised more than $3.35 million from 5,700+ investors—all before the next price jump. One of the most appealing aspects for early participants is a guaranteed 3x return at launch. With a listing price set at $0.06, anyone who joins now automatically secures a triple on their investment. However, many analysts predict the price could climb even higher once MUTM appears on exchanges, potentially soaring by up to 42x as mainstream adoption increases. A DeFi Platform with Real Utility Mutuum Finance revolves around a decentralized lending and borrowing mechanism, letting users lend out crypto assets for passive income while also providing borrowers with liquidity—without forcing them to sell their holdings. This model caters to various user needs, from generating regular returns on idle funds to facilitating quick, collateral-backed loans. The team is undergoing a Certik audit of its smart contracts, underscoring its commitment to safety and transparency. Known for its in-depth blockchain audits, Certik helps bolster investor trust by identifying potential vulnerabilities and reinforcing the contract’s integrity. Buy-and-Distribute Mechanism Mutuum Finance uses platform fees to buy back MUTM tokens, then redistributes them to mtToken holders. This system effectively maintains steady demand and incentivizes ongoing participation—important qualities for any project hoping to outlast market volatility. Another highlight is Mutuum Finance’s overcollateralized stablecoin, pegged to the U.S. dollar and backed by on-chain assets. Users can borrow against their crypto collateral without relinquishing ownership, while the stablecoin supply self-adjusts based on borrowing and repayment activities, offering a more sustainable model than typical shared liquidity pools. Thanks to a well-articulated development plan, Mutuum Finance appears set to outpace its initial targets. On top of that, the project is running a $100,000 giveaway for early supporters, awarding $10,000 in MUTM tokens to 10 participants—an initiative designed to promote engagement and reward early believers. What’s Fueling the 42x Projection? The drive behind this ambitious forecast includes: Robust Fundamentals: A clear DeFi solution addressing real market needs Certik Audit: Heightened trust via professional code review Tight Supply: Limited presale tokens, generating scarcity Rising Demand: Growing user base seeking the platform’s stablecoin and lending functionalities Buy-and-Distribute Program: Steady token buybacks help offset selling pressure Upcoming Exchange Listings: Exposure to new markets can push prices upward With a balanced combination of near-term incentives and long-range potential, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is positioning itself as a promising option for both short-term speculators and dedicated holders alike.

That is a sign that the coin may be on the cusp of a bullish breakout.

Data shows that the network incinerated over 280 million tokens in the last seven days, bringing the total tokens burned to 406 billion. Over 336.2 billion LUNC tokens have moved to the burn wallet, while almost 70 billion of these coins have been burned on-chain. Most of these burns were from Terraform Labs, which a U.S. bankruptcy court ordered. Binance, the biggest crypto exchange, has also been the most active LUNC burner in the industry. It has burned over 71 billion tokens in the past three years, and has consistently supported all of its upgrades. Meanwhile, more LUNC holders are staking them. That’s an optimistic sign that, perhaps, the token will bounce back. The LUNC staking ratio has risen to 15.85%. That’s its highest level since Nov. 10, 2024. A high staking ratio, especially when a coin is falling, is a highly bullish sign.

This was a notable level as the coin failed to drop below it in July and September last year. It also failed to move below the price in 2024. The last time LUNC’s price dropped below this level was in June 2022, when it dropped to a low of $0.00003440. This drop turned out to be a false breakdown, too. Therefore, there is a likelihood that the Terra Luna Classic price has formed a quadruple bottom — a popular bullish reversal sign. A bullish breakout may see it jump to the next key resistance at $0.0001797, the highest swing in November last year. This price is about 180% above the current level. A drop below that support level will signal more downside to $0.000034. LUNC’s history The LUNC token, originally known as the Luna token, was created by Do Kwon and Daniel Shin, co-founders of Terraform Labs. Terraform Labs was based in South Korea, and they launched the Luna token as part of the Terra blockchain ecosystem. The project aimed to create a stablecoin (TerraUSD, or UST) through an algorithmic mechanism tied to Luna. After the UST stablecoin de-pegged from the U.S. dollar in May 2022, the value of Luna (now LUNC after a rebranding) crashed. This led to a massive loss in value and the collapse of the Terra ecosystem. Afterward, a hard fork was created, leading to the introduction of Terra 2.0, and a new token was issued to replace the old one.

This bypasses Western sanctions and establishes a more independent way to conduct cross-border transactions. Anton Siluanov, Finance Minister, said the changes started to take effect after the legal framework was amended in August 2024, allowing mining companies to transact with cryptocurrency. This was done to overcome trade disruptions caused by Western sanctions and the US war in Ukraine. A Chinese buyer, for example, pays a banker offshore in exchange for Russian oil. The banker then converts the money into crypto and sends it to Russia, where it is finally converted into roubles. An anonymous source for Reuters claims that transactions like this occur every month for tens of millions in dollars. The source claims to be familiar with the process and has seen it take place. Fiat currency, however, remains the main medium for Russian oil trade despite numerous sanctions from Western countries. Russia, meanwhile, has been using multiple methods to bias sanctions, including using other currencies, such as the United Arab Emirates dirham, to make large-scale cross-border payments. China has remained cautious of cryptocurrencies despite Russia using stablecoins for cross-border payments. In 2021, the country essentially banned digital assets from the mainland. However, Hong Kong has embraced the new technology and even become a global hub for digital asset innovation. Russia has embraced crypto cautiously. This week, it created an Experimental Legal Regime (ELR), allowing a limited group of wealthy investors to trade cryptocurrencies for three years. Crypto-based cross-border payments in Russia only constitute a small fraction of the $192 billion oil trade; however, this shows the practicable use of crypto in avoiding large-scale sanctions. Other countries like Iran and Venezuela, have also used similar strategies to avoid external sanctions. Bitcoin, and cryptocurrency in general, was designed from the start to resist censorship, and thus proved to be quite an effective technology in facilitating payments. The Ukraine conflict was a catalyst for this change in global payment processes, revealing a lack of consistency regarding sanctions and providing a new use case for the digital assets market. America will most likely monitor these blockchain transactions to see whether they continue to challenge traditional forms of finance and hegemony. Russia may emerge from this conflict as a major contributor to digital asset technology, inspiring other nations to use similar means and regaining economic stability in uncertain times. Regulatory barriers continue to block cryptocurrency despite a strong case for Blockchain technology and a noticeable weakness regarding traditional reserves as a method to enable cross-border trade in a safe, reliable, and timely manner. Russia has made efforts to adopt the BRICS payment system and has attempted to adopt the currencies of trading partners, but alas, it has continued to fall back on using dollars, euros, and the SWIFT standard for transactions. Trading partners, like China, are therefore exposed to the secondary effects of Western sanctions, limiting trade opportunities for the two countries. In August 2024, Russia expanded its mining regulation, requiring industrial miners to register with a government database, comply with consumption restrictions, and report ongoing operations. The regulation also included the use of Russian-mined cryptocurrency to facilitate foreign transactions, cross-border operations, and international settlements. One of BRICS’ strategies is for member states to build sovereign technological infrastructure so that they are less reliant on Western technology. BRICS stipulates that members should retain technology control to limit Western hegemony from dominating supply chains. Russia has started embracing sovereign technologies, such as Sberbank launching a digital assets project in 2022, forming part of a larger trade and global independence project. In December 2024, a Russian lawmaker suggested that Bitcoin, due to its decentralized design, should be used to reduce reliance on western international finance systems. He further indicated that a Bitcoin reserve should be created, despite the ongoing criticism of such a reserve. The recent mining legislation, which included a section on cryptocurrency, may be a vital step for Russia to adopt digital asset technology, and it may continue to develop over the coming months and years. After all, Bitcoin may be a useful transition technology, from the preferred American standards, to a new and developing BRICS way of handling transactions. The case for Bitcoin as a Russian reserve currency appeared good in December 2024, as the digital asset continued to see market highs exceeding $100,000. Many see the asset as a tool to provide an extra layer of economic resilience during uncertain times and under the constant threat of global sanctions. Russia may continue to invest in digital asset technology, and more so as Bitcoin adoption rises in popularity.",Cryptocurrency|News|stablecoin|Tether|USDT,EN,0,0,TECHNOLOGY|USDT|COMMODITY|ASIA|BTC,"{'name': 'ZyCrypto', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/zycrypto.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",zycrypto,2025-03-16 11:10:33

This marks the highest level of open interest in 42 days, according to CoinGlass data . Highest Toncoin OI Levels in Over a Month On March 15, reports surfaced that Durov had left France, where he had been detained for six months following his August 2024 arrest. Shortly after, Toncoin (TON) saw a significant uptick in trading activity, with its price jumping 17% to $3.45, per CoinMarketCap data . Toncoin serves as the native cryptocurrency of The Open Network (TON), which powers Telegram’s Mini App ecosystem. The recent surge in open interest signals increased market engagement, particularly among derivative traders who are betting on further volatility. Crypto analysts have taken note of Toncoin’s price action, with Crypto Billion, a popular trading resource, suggesting that TON is stabilizing near key support levels and could be entering a long-term accumulation phase. However, if this rally loses steam, a return to the $3 level could lead to $18.8 million in long positions being liquidated. Market Response Mirrors August 2024 Arrest This is not the first time Toncoin’s open interest has reacted to news surrounding Pavel Durov. When he was arrested in August 2024 , TON’s open interest spiked by 32% within a day, while its price dropped nearly 12%. Durov’s legal troubles have been closely watched by the crypto community, particularly given concerns that his arrest could set a precedent for crackdowns on privacy-focused services. He was accused of operating a platform that facilitated illicit transactions, a charge that sparked widespread debate over the role of decentralization and regulatory oversight in the digital economy. His reported move to Dubai, a jurisdiction with no extradition agreements with several countries, could have long-term implications for Telegram and the broader TON ecosystem. Just two months ago, Telegram announced it would discontinue support for all blockchains except The Open Network, reinforcing its commitment to the TON ecosystem.

41750304,https://zycrypto.com/?p=103727,1742124237,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/zycrypto.png,XRP Lawsuit: SEC Legal Battle with Ripple Likely Ending Soon — Here’s What to Expect,https://zycrypto.com/xrp-lawsuit-sec-legal-battle-with-ripple-likely-ending-soon-heres-what-to-expect/,"The legal battle between the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and Ripple could be coming to an end, according to rumours that Ripple has been negotiating for better terms in the background and that the SEC wants to reset its relationship with the crypto industry. Fox News reporter Eleanor Terrett revealed the news based on her anonymous sources. She detailed that the SEC and Ripple aimed to resolve the legal dispute and were finalizing a few details of the previous agreement, particularly surrounding the $125 million fine. “My understanding”, wrote Terrett, “is that the delay in reaching an agreement is due to Ripple’s legal team negotiating more favorable terms regarding the August district court ruling, which imposed a $125M fine on the company and included a permanent injunction preventing the company from selling XRP to institutional investors”. The legal battle between the SEC and Ripple has been one of the most closely watched disputes in the crypto world. The SEC alleges that Ripple sold unlicensed securities when they held a sale of XRP tokens. In August 2024, the Federal Court ordered Ripple to pay a $125 million fee and banned it from selling XRP tokens to institutional investors. The impact on Ripple cannot be overstated because its business model was disrupted. The recent news of a possible end to the legal disputes is inspiring for the Ripple team. “The argument, I’m told”, wrote Terrett, “is that if the new SEC leadership is wiping the enforcement slate clean for all previously-targeted crypto firms because it believes regulatory clarity will resolve the underlying issue, why should Ripple still be penalized”? “Accepting the Torres ruling as it stands would mean that Ripple is essentially agreeing to admit to wrongdoing – but now the SEC itself is seemingly unsure whether any wrongdoing occurred. There’s no real playbook for this kind of thing, which could explain why this case is taking longer to resolve than the rest. Stay tuned”. Gary Gensler, former SEC head, disputed the August 2024 ruling, presided over by Judge Torres, because the fee was reduced from $1.95 billion to $125 million. However, many analysts watching the Ripple saga unfold, believe that a settlement is underway, and given the new Trump administration, may drop the case entirely. The delay, with a final settlement, comes as Ripple’s legal team negotiates more reductions in Judge Torres’ ruling. The team remains optimistic as the SEC winds down its ‘war on crypto’ and numerous lawsuits against crypto businesses. Therefore, the original ruling by Judge Torres may be wholly dropped given the radical changes in regulatory policies. The Ripple team initially saw Torres’ ruling as a success because the court ruled that the automated sales of tokens to retail traders did not constitute a securities transaction regarding the XRP sale. The SEC is completely reversing its ‘war on crypto’, cancelling its many legal battles with Coinbase, Kraken, and Cumberland. Ripple investors have patiently waited for their token to benefit from the new changes. Mark Uyeda, the new SEC chairman, has upended the department’s focus, reversing previous cases and even changing the entire perspective of operations. Ripple Labs, notably its legal team, sees this seismic change as indicating a complete removal of the legal case. Ripple’s legal team sees any compromise with the SEC, such as making a settlement, as an admission of guilt on their part. The SEC itself disagreed with Torres’ ruling because it disputed the findings that XRP sales did not constitute a securities transaction. The SEC, under previous leadership, challenged the court ruling in January and would prefer the original fee of around $1.95 billion.",Cryptocurrency|News|Ripple|XRP News,EN,0,0,REGULATION|XRP|BUSINESS|EXCHANGE,"{'name': 'ZyCrypto', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/zycrypto.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",zycrypto,2025-03-16 11:23:57

Although it rebounded 2.8% to $1.70, DOGE has a long way to go before it can challenge this year’s all-time high of $1.48. As Mutuum Finance (MUTM), a decentralized lending platform, approaches take-off with its Phase 3 presale, predictions of a price surge to over $5 post-launch are on the table. Even though Dogecoin’s future is ultimately dependent upon speculative ETF approvals, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) offers real-world utility to cater to investors who want returns now. DOGE’s Technical Momentum Meets Resistance The recent rebound of Dogecoin follows a hold above key support at $1.60, leading to analyst projections for a rally to $3. History shows surges of 88% and 187% in 2023 and 2024, respectively, can happen when the RSI follows the same track, provided the bullish patterns remain. But the meme coin’s dependence on ETF speculation and whale accumulation — 1.7 billion DOGE acquired within 72 hours — prompted volatility worries. Analysts like Ali Martinez believe Dogecoin can achieve as high as $0.50 in the coming times, however, unlike Dogecoin, which has no intrinsic utility, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) follows a structured growth model. Mutuum Finance: Presale Approaching Phase 4 Mutuum Finance presale Phase 3 raised $3.4 million at a token price of $0.02 to more than 5700 holders. Phase 4 will increase the price to $0.025, equating to a 25% increase for current investors ahead of the next stage. The project’s tokenomics ensure a 200% return at its $0.06 exchange listing, but post-launch projections are far more aggressive. Analysts attribute Mutuum Finance (MUTM)’s lending infrastructure and buy-pressure mechanics to a possible run to $3.50—a 17,400% increase from the presale rate. Meme-based volatility is not the case for Mutuum Finance (MUTM), which is built on the premise of decentralized lending. These interest-bearing mtTokens grow in value over time and can be traded across platforms. Platform fees can be paid for in different forms, however 10% of those fees collected are used to repurchase MUTM Tokens, forming a way to redistribute to the people staking and effectively providing a use case that has strong continual demand. This model, along with overcollateralized loans and peer-to-peer lending options can make Mutuum Finance (MUTM) a liquidity hub for both stablecoins and volatile assets such as Dogecoin. Security Improvements Gradually Increase Investor Confidence Certik audit of mutuum finance is aimed at transparency, as they are on their way to finalize a Certik audit of their smart contracts. Results will be announced via official channels when the vote is completed, further adding to the platform’s credibility. Deadline Draws Near for $0.02 token levels as Phase 3 Sells Out! Not only do early participants secure pre-listing gains, but they also qualify for a $100,000 giveaway, adding a sense of urgency for both retail and institutional buyers. An Opportunity Both Dual And in a Dynamic Market While Dogecoin aims for $1, Mutuum Finance off balance sheet demand Its presale initiatives and structured token mechanics provide a tangible growth roadmap, unlike meme coins that depend solely on hype. Mutuum Finance (MUTM): Ecosystem Over Speculation For Investors Seeking Real Value In DeFi’s Next Evolution With the Certik audit ticking down and Phase 3 now sold out, the $5 target for the project is looking more and more achievable. Keep following Mutuum Finance’s official channels for presale updates and audit announcements. Phase 3 is close to filling up and delaying will miss out on the last chance to buy MUTM under $0.025.

Specifically, the Chainlink price has declined by more than 50% in the last three months, underscoring the dwindling climate of the crypto market. However, the future might not be all bleak, as the latest price outlook suggests a promising future for the LINK token. Is Chainlink Price Gearing For A 100% Move? In a recent post on the X platform, a crypto analyst with the pseudonym Satoshi Flipper shared an exciting analysis of the Chainlink price. Referencing the current layout of its daily price chart, the crypto pundit projected LINK to go as high as $31 over the next few weeks. Related Reading: Ethereum Struggles Below $2K as Bitcoin Recovers—Will ETH Catch Up? This bullish analysis is based on the appearance of the falling wedge pattern on the Chainlink price chart. The falling wedge pattern is a technical analysis formation characterized by two descending and converging trendlines; an upper line connecting the lower highs and the lower line connecting the lower lows. Wedge formations — which could be rising or falling — are considered continuation or reversal patterns, depending on whether the price breaks down or breaks out. In the falling wedge, if the price breaks above the upper boundary as it narrows into the descending lines, a trend reversal is identified. This scenario appears to be playing out on the daily Chainlink price chart, as the altcoin continues to persist in the current downtrend. However, a break above the upper trendline would indicate a shift to an upward trend. As shown in the chart above, the price of LINK seems to be testing the upper boundary line already. Satoshi Flipper expects the altcoin to surge to as high as $31 if a successful close occurs outside the falling wedge. As of this writing, the value of LINK is hovering around the $14 mark, reflecting an over 2% leap in the past 24 hours. A Chainlink price move to $31 would represent a more than 100% surge from the current point. 640,000 LINK Tokens Flow Out Of Centralized Exchanges According to crypto pundit Ali Martinez, most LINK investors have been moving their tokens off centralized exchanges. Recent data from Santiment shows that more than 640,000 LINK have made their way off crypto exchanges in the past 24 hours. This magnitude of exchange outflow supports the current bullish prognosis for Chainlink price, as it implies that the token supply on exchanges (which offer trading services) contracts. With fewer tokens available for sale in the open market, the altcoin’s price would face less selling pressure. However, it is worth mentioning that this significant exchange outflow could be connected to Chainlink’s quarterly token unlock, which saw the release of 19 million LINK tokens on Friday, March 15.

On-chain analysts at Bubblemaps uncovered evidence of insider manipulation, showing that 82% of the total supply was controlled by a small group of wallets, raising rug pull concerns. On-chain data exposes Hayden’s connection to $WOLF Hayden has a history of failed meme coins, including $LIBRA and $MELANIA, both of which ended in massive losses for investors. His latest project, $WOLF, follows the same pattern. Bubblemaps says Hayden has been concealing his identity but left a trail of on-chain transactions that links him directly to yet another multi-million-dollar crypto disaster. The WallStreetBets account promoted the $WOLF meme coin before its crash. Source: Bubblemaps (X/Twitter) Bubblemaps, alongside crypto investigator Coffeezilla, traced $WOLF’s transaction history and identified Hayden as the mastermind. Bubblemaps detailed how they followed 17 addresses and five cross-chain transfers, all leading to one address: OxcEAe, which they confirmed belongs to Hayden. In a post on X, Bubblemaps said, “Starting with the $WOLF creator 6MsuHd, we followed funding transfers back across 17 addresses and 5 cross-chain transfers. All led to a single address: OxcEAe. The same one owned by Hayden Davis!” Bubblemaps tracked 17 addresses and five cross-chain transfers to one OxcEAe address, which they claim belongs to Hayden. Source: Bubblemaps (X/Twitter) Hayden’s $ LIBRA remains one of the largest rug pulls in recent crypto history. The meme coin was heavily promoted by Argentine President Javier Milei, who said it could be a solution to Argentina’s economic crisis in a post on X. Investors rushed in, pushing $LIBRA’s market cap past $1 billion, before it crashed overnight, erasing $99 million in liquidity. More than 10,000 investors lost a combined $250 million, while Hayden allegedly cashed out nearly $100 million before the crash. Following the $LIBRA collapse, Argentine attorney Gregorio Dalbon called for Hayden’s immediate arrest and requested an Interpol Red Notice for fraud and financial crimes. Regulators worldwide are now closely monitoring his movements, but as you can see, he has so far evaded law enforcement and continues to launch new meme coins under fake identities. Hayden’s rise from small-time hustler to global fugitive Hayden’s background is far from ordinary. He was a college dropout who sold energy drinks and Oreos to pay his bills as a teenager. On LinkedIn, he once listed “hustling expert” as one of his key skills. He’s currently 28 years old. His venture capital firm, Kelsier Ventures, is run by his father, Tom Davis, a convicted felon who previously ran a controversial Christian adoption nonprofit before switching to entrepreneurship and business coaching. In 2023, Kelsier moved its operations from America to Dubai, where it invested in crypto startups and provided marketing services for NFTs, exchanges, and meme coins. At the time, Tom Davis was far from a cryptocurrency expert. Earlier, he had gotten into trouble forging checks, he told the Christian Broadcasting Network, and pleaded guilty to burglary, according to law-enforcement records. He went to Bible school and became an entrepreneur, investing in bricks-and-mortar businesses such as Skrimp Shack, a chain of seafood restaurants in the U.S. and the Middle East. Though Tom Davis was Kelsier’s founder, Hayden was its face. Industry peers who worked with Hayden said he’s a smooth talker and a natural dealmaker. Cryptopolitan Academy: Tired of market swings?

The Dynamics of Ethereum Ethereum lost more than 44% of its value in the first quarter. The cryptocurrency network has also seen record sales in the past three months. CryptoQuant CEO Ki Young Ju explains this to an unprecedented wave of sales. Due to massive sell-offs, Ethereum's market dominance level has dropped significantly. According to CoinMarketCap, at the time of writing it stands at 8.5% - the lowest level since 2020. This situation has sparked active discussions on social network X (formerly Twitter), where analysts are trying to explain the reasons for the fall of Ethereum. ”What happened to Ethereum?” - asked Tron founder and Huobi Global advisor Justin Sun in his post . The Impact of Layer 2 Blockchains Analyst Camila Russo believes that Ethereum's decline is due to the rise of Layer 2 (L2) blockchains. These scaling solutions improve network performance and reduce the load on the main Ethereum network. However, the listed pros have no effect on the price of ETH. ”There's a path to fix Ethereum L2 fragmentation and horrible UX. superchain interop, intents etc. It's gonna happen, eth community is galvanized around unifying Ethereum and they'll fix it,” Rousseau explained. Technical Basis In addition to problems with scaling L2 blockchains, some Ethereum developers are concerned about the blockchain's technical foundation, which calls into question its long-term viability. Uncle Rockstar Developer has called Ethereum an ”absolute cesspit”. He says the network has strayed far from its promise of becoming the world's premier decentralized blockchain. ”To cover up major flaws, needless complexity kept increasing... This occasionally leads to hacker attacks like the one that cost Bybit 400,000 ETH (about $1.5 billion),” he declared. The developer also criticized Ethereum's governance, arguing that it has become a centralized startup that mainly benefits its co-founder Vitalik Buterin. Lack of a Compelling Narrative Blockstream advisor Tür Demeester said the lack of a compelling narrative was another major factor in Ethereum's decline. ”It has run out of stories,” joked Demeester. He was referring to a tweet from 2017 that warned that cryptocurrencies that depend on interest rather than utility will face challenges. This view is based on the assumption that the market is creating new narratives faster than Ethereum can support them. Regulatory uncertainty and institutional indecision Regulatory issues also cloud Ethereum's future. Unlike bitcoin, which is already recognized as a commodity, staking and revenue-generating features leave room for Ethereum to be classified as a security. Francisco Quartin de Macedo noted that Ethereum's monetary policy has become less transparent since The Merge update. This update reduced activity on the network, leading to inflationary pressures instead of the expected deflation. Macedo also emphasized that Ethereum lacks the institutional support that the endorsement of the BTC-ETF has given bitcoin. In addition, bitcoin's positioning as digital gold strengthens its credibility. ”Frankly, Ethereum still seems like an institutional choice, but it's unclear how this will affect its price,” noted Macedo. He pointed out that Ethereum's fragmented l2 ecosystem and regulatory uncertainty have scared some investors away from long-term investments in ETH. How ETH feels At the time of writing, ETH traded at $1,897. Over the last month and year, the asset has fallen in price by 28% and 52%, respectively. The altcoin has a market capitalization of nearly $229 billion, with daily trading volume sitting at over $17 billion.",News|Ethereum,EN,0,0,ETH|TRADING|BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|MARKET,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-03-16 11:45:21

According to a White House memo issued by Presidential Counsel David A. Warrington, Sacks and his investment firm Craft Ventures liquidated their crypto holdings, including Bitcoin ( BTC ), Ethereum ( ETH ) and Solana ( SOL ), before Trump started his second term on January 20th. Sacks also sold his position in the Bitwise 10 Crypto Index Fund (BITW) and unloaded his shares in Coinbase (COIN), Robinhood (HOOD) and private digital asset companies as well as limited partner interests in crypto-focused investment funds, including Multicoin Capital and Blockchain Capital. The White House adds that Sacks started to sell his limited partner interests in roughly 90 venture capital funds “out of an abundance of caution” as the firms may choose to invest in the digital asset industry. Warrington says Sacks and Craft Ventures disposed of over $200 million worth of investments in the digital asset industry, including at least $85 million personally held by Sacks, in a bid to protect the integrity of his position as special advisor for crypto. “Crucially, you have already taken significant steps to minimize potential conflicts of interest due to digital asset holdings – divesting from hundreds of millions of dollars in digital assets or digital asset-related industry entities.” While Sacks has either liquidated or is in the process of unloading his remaining exposure to the digital asset industry, the memo notes that Craft Ventures still has interests in crypto-related firms, including the token management platform BitGo, proof-of-space and proof-of-time blockchain Chia Network and blockchain-based gaming developer Dapper Labs.

Stablecoins have become an integral part of the digital asset ecosystem, reaching $15.6 trn in annualized transaction volume in 2024 (119% and 200% of VISA and Mastercard, according to ARK Invest) and now seamlessly bridge traditional finance with blockchain-based transactions. However, concerns over transparency, security, and regulatory oversight have long surrounded the industry. You might also like: US leadership in crypto: The focus is on stablecoins | Opinion To address these concerns, the European Union has introduced the Markets in Crypto-Assets Regulation (MiCA), establishing clear guidelines for stablecoin issuance. This regulatory framework is designed to protect consumers, ensure financial stability, and create a level playing field for digital (aka crypto) assets. This means businesses and institutions can work with trusted, transparent, and compliant stablecoin providers. MiCA, which came into effect in 2024, is a landmark step in shaping the future of digital assets in Europe. It provides a clear framework for stablecoin issuers, mandating strict financial and operational requirements. It requires stablecoin issuers to fulfill a number of important regulatory demands, starting with, first and foremost, seeking regulatory approval, whereby issuers of electronic money tokens must hold an Electronic Money Institution license or be a financial institution. Next, they must have full one-to-one reserves, meaning every token must be fully backed by high-quality, highly liquid financial reserves. Custody of the assets must be independent, so reserves must be held separately from the issuer’s own assets, ensuring full redeemability. The issuers must provide regular reports and transparency to regulators and undergo independent financial audits. Lastly, there can be no interest payments or yield on MiCA compliant stablecoins, ensuring they are used as a means of payment rather than an investment vehicle. The role of regulation Regulation really matters as these measures are critical for building trust in the stablecoin market, ensuring that only regulated and responsible issuers remain operational in Europe. But it isn’t just about compliance; it’s about building a foundation of trust, stability, and long-term viability. Many digital assets have operated in an unregulated environment, which has led to uncertainty, lack of transparency, and potential risks for businesses and investors. However, with MiCA in place, unregulated stablecoins will no longer be allowed to operate in the European market. Businesses should choose to use the stablecoins of regulated issuers as this provides them with a number of safety measures, such as legal security, whereby businesses can transact confidently, knowing that their stablecoin provider is a regulated entity, following strict financial and operational requirements. As they are fully backed and audited, stablecoins provide market stability that minimizes risk and provides a predictable, stable digital asset for transactions. Since compliance with European financial regulations reassures institutions, regulators, and corporate clients, institutional confidence has become the norm. It is also very important to consider the jurisdiction that the stablecoin issuer is based in. For example, The Netherlands is one of the few AAA-rated banking countries in Europe, recognized for its financial strength, stability, and regulatory rigor. Using stablecoins issued by EMIs that maintain Tier 1 banking relationships is critical to ensure that the euro reserves backing the stablecoins in circulation are held in accounts with trusted financial institutions. Tier 1 financial institutions have large balance sheets, ensuring that stablecoin reserves are well diversified and not subject to high concentration risk. There are many benefits of banking in an AAA jurisdiction, in particular, funds are safeguarded in highly liquid, top-tier financial institutions, leading to stronger reserve management. It provides greater institutional trust, and, of course, businesses prefer stablecoins backed by regulated, well-capitalized banks. Then there’s the fact that a strong banking framework ensures seamless fiat on/off ramps and mitigates de-pegging risks, providing scalability and liquidity. Stablecoin issuers can even take this a step further by holding reserves in an independently structured and governed foundation, ensuring full asset protection in the unlikely event of an issuer’s financial difficulty. The future of stablecoins in Europe is clear. Only regulated, transparent, and fully backed digital assets will survive under MiCA.

According to authorities, the Bitcoin heist remains, to this day, one of the biggest in the history of the country. According to reports , Malone Lam Yu Xuan went from being a student in a secondary school in Choa Chu Kang, Singapore to being seen as a crypto whizz-kid by some in the United States in 2023. In that period, he had a mansion, a fleet of expensive cars, luxury clothes, and other assets that rivaled some of the top celebrities globally. According to investigators, the Singapore student was living off the millions stolen from several investors. The statement to investigators was before August 2024, when Lam was said to have joined some co-conspirators to commit one of the biggest thefts in the history of the United States. Singapore student to face trial for crypto theft According to court documents, Lam had been living in the United States on an expired visa, with the student turning 20 last year. The documents mentioned that Lam, a teenager at the time, pocketed millions from the theft, splashing some on himself and some of his friends. The filing mentioned that he purchased and gifted one Jeandiel Serrano a 2023 Ferrari FS and a 2024 Mercedes SL. A picture of Lam with insets showing him partying and an influencer he gifted a luxury bag. Source: Mothership (Twitter/X). A year after he bought the luxury vehicles, Lam and Serrano were accused of a Bitcoin theft that involved a single victim between August 18 and 19. The pair stole about 4,100 Bitcoins from their victim. Presently, Lam is facing two counts of indictment in the District of Columbia for conspiracy to commit wire fraud, and conspiracy to launder monetary instruments. Each of the charges he’s accused carries a maximum term of 20 years. According to checks carried out by authorities, Lam started attending Unity Secondary School in 2017 but left after a while. He told United States authorities that he had dropped out of school when he was around 13 years old. Lam was an active member of the gaming community, using the moniker ‘Greavys’ in Minecraft. He also used other monikers like ‘Anne Hathaway’ and ‘Malone’ on other gaming platforms, including Discord. United States authorities’ investigation uncovers atrocities According to reports, Lam moved to the United States in October 2023 but had already forged a friendship with Serrano, an American citizen, before then. The pair were notorious in the online gaming community, with users accusing them of looting or stealing players’ accounts to sell for cash. United States authorities mentioned that Lam entered the country through a visa waiver program, which allows individuals from about 42 countries, including Singapore to enter the US for 90 days for business or leisure. His visa expired in January 2024, but he continued to live in the country illegally. Authorities mentioned that he spent time in Texas and Los Angeles, and also traveled to Canada at some point. While he was in the US, the Singapore native developed an interest in the flashy lifestyle, flaunting expensive cars, clothes, mansions, and even holding big parties where they spent recklessly. He told the court he was into crypto, but documents showed he got rich by hacking and stealing digital assets. During his first hearing in September 2024 at the district court in South Florida, United States prosecutor Jonathan Stratton said Lam was a “sophisticated crypto fraudster.” He argued against granting him bail, noting that the Singaporean presented two dangers. Stratton mentioned that he was a very sophisticated crypto fraudster, telling the court that he orchestrated one of the biggest crypto hacks in the country. “He can do those kinds of hacking from anywhere, and there is no reasonable combination of conditions that pre-trial services can implement that will prevent his ability to further exploit crypto investors throughout the country,” Stratton said. He added that Lam can hide electronic evidence, noting that he obstructed justice by deleting his Telegram account after he was tipped off by the co-conspirator’s girlfriend. According to investigators, the case started to come together when they identified Serrano. He was arrested at the Los Angeles airport in September 2024 after returning from a holiday in the company of his girlfriend. After she was interviewed by the authorities, the girlfriend tipped off Lam. Authorities apprehended the Singaporean as he was trying to flee. He has been held in detention since his arrest, with the prosecutors noting that Lam is a flight risk. Investigators tracked Lam’s affluent lifestyle After his arrest, Lam told United States investigators that he was involved in several crypto scams, making millions from his activities. He said he used the stolen money to fund his affluent lifestyle. In his statement, the Singaporean said he, Serrano, and other accomplices hit the jackpot in August 2024, dividing the proceeds from the crime among themselves. Using his portion of the loot, Lam amassed 31 luxury vehicles, including a Pagani Huayra worth $3.8 million, a Lamborghini Revuelto worth $1 million, and custom Porsches and Ferraris. United States authorities confirmed that 22 luxury vehicles belonging to Lam are yet to be located, including a white Lamborghini that had his name on it. Aside from luxury cars, the Singapore national rented multiple mansions, with one in Miami where he paid $68,000 monthly on one residence. He also acquired luxury watches, purchasing one of the watches for about $1.8 million. Prosecutors mentioned that the Singapore national was very popular in the Los Angeles nightlife scenes because of the bottle services he demanded. He also gave out handbags to strangers, with several influencers creating videos to detail how he had given them bags from French fashion company Hermes. In September 2024, social media influencer Skylar Harrison posted a video on TikTok detailing how she was invited into Lam’s entourage after she ran into him at a club called Keys. She mentioned that she was offered a Hermes bag just to join him at the section he was in. She added that he purchased $100,000 worth of alcoholic drinks in about 10 minutes after he met her. She mentioned that he told her he was the son of a Chinese billionaire. According to investigations, he spent over $500,000 at nightclubs every night for a week and tried to pay in cryptocurrency in some instances. The flashy lifestyle contributed to his downfall, as investigators were looking for him and found his name on a banner at a club where he splurged hundreds of thousands of dollars. The Singaporean’s spending spree was so rife that social media platforms had many videos of him in designer clothes partying. The Singaporean national is presently being held in Virginia, with his lawyer Scott Armstrong noting that his trial will take place in October 2025. The lawyer said Lam wants to file other legal attacks, with most of them being suppressive motions that require the US government to provide meaningful discovery in the case against him. He also said Lam is calling for the search warrant affidavits and reports relevant to the searches that were carried out in his case. Prosecutors have mentioned that Lam may be looking at between 168 and 210 months in jail because of the gravity of the theft, with about $100 million in stolen Bitcoin still missing.

The content and materials featured on this page are for educational purposes only. As Bitcoin and Solana dominate headlines with ETF buzz, Bitlemons (BLEM) is quietly gaining massive investor interest. Table of Contents Are investors sleeping on BLEM’s massive potential? Can institutional money keep BTC’s rally alive? Could ETF approval send SOL soaring? Could BLEM surprise the market? Bitcoin (BTC) is securing its place as a favorite among institutional investors, with ETFs driving massive demand. Meanwhile, Solana (SOL) is inching closer to an ETF milestone that could send its price soaring. But as big players dominate the headlines, a new contender, Bitlemons (BLEM), is quietly making its move — and fast. With its Stage 2 presale nearly sold out, BLEM is on the verge of a major price shift. Could this rapidly growing Web3 gaming token be the sleeper hit of the year? Are investors sleeping on BLEM’s massive potential? Bitlemons is quickly establishing itself as a force to watch, with its presale nearly reaching full capacity. As of the time of writing, 98.07% of Stage 2 has sold out, raising over $1.93 million. With 860,940 BLEM tokens remaining before Stage 3 launches at a higher price, investors are moving fast to secure their holdings at the current $0.02 rate. The appeal of Bitlemons goes beyond presale momentum. The project has already rolled out its exclusive Web3 gaming platform, featuring original titles like BLEM Keno, Crash by Bitlemons, and Wheel of Bitlemons. Unlike many gaming projects reliant on third-party providers, Bitlemons’ in-house games generate higher revenue margins, benefiting token holders through a 30% revenue share model. Half of these funds go toward staking rewards, while the other half is allocated for buybacks and burns, ensuring long-term value appreciation. Adding to the excitement, rumors of strategic celebrity partnerships are fueling speculation about mainstream adoption. With top influencers and sports personalities reportedly in discussions, Bitlemons could see an influx of new investors once these collaborations go public.

Bitcoin continues to hold the spotlight with institutional adoption ramping up. Its price has been finding some upside momentum, with analysts closely watching previous resistance levels $82,500 and $84,000. A breakout could push BTC beyond $91,000, driven by increasing demand from institutional investors leveraging newly approved ETFs. The growing correlation between Bitcoin and traditional financial markets further cements its position as a premier asset. With risk-on sentiment rising across global markets, BTC remains a key focus for both retail and institutional players looking to diversify their portfolios. Could ETF approval send SOL soaring? Solana is also making headlines following Cboe’s ETF filing on behalf of Franklin Templeton. If approved, this could lead to a surge in institutional investment, potentially driving SOL’s price toward the $1,000 mark. However, the market remains cautious due to recent sell-offs linked to FTX and Alameda Research liquidations. Despite the short-term selling pressure, whale activity is making a strong return. Large investors are accumulating SOL, signaling confidence in the asset’s long-term potential. Coupled with a bullish RSI divergence, Solana could be on the verge of a reversal. Could BLEM surprise the market? While Bitcoin and Solana cater to institutional traders, Bitlemons is carving out a niche in Web3 gaming. The project’s roadmap includes continuous game releases, expanding its ecosystem to keep users engaged and drive further adoption. Moreover, the community-driven nature of Bitlemons is setting it apart. A growing base of passionate investors, combined with incentives and reward programs, is fueling excitement around the token. With Stage 2 nearly sold out and Stage 3 introducing a price hike to $0.03, more investors are joining. Bitlemons’ 1,000,000 USDT giveaway is turning heads. By purchasing BLEM tokens, users stand a chance to win up to 50,000 USDT. This incentive, coupled with the project’s revenue-generating model, makes Bitlemons an intriguing prospect in the crypto landscape. For more information on BitLemons, visit the website or socials .

TON is eyeing a 100% rally in 2025 As Crypto Patel notes, TON’s price has “perfectly bounced” from its support level of around $2.50. Furthermore, the support falls inside the $2.40-3.00 area that served as resistance in December 2022-April 2023 and September 2023-April 2024 periods. The analyst argues that the area now served as a “great entry zone,” citing TON’s ongoing rebound from the same range. TON/USDT weekly price chart.

Limited Tokens Left Before the Next Phase | Apu Apustaja and Degen Gain Attention,https://thecoinrise.com/arctic-pablos-deflationary-burns-are-reducing-supply-fast-limited-tokens-left-before-the-next-phase-apu-apustaja-and-degen-gain-attention/,"Have you ever wondered what it would be like to invest in a meme coin before it takes off? The crypto world is buzzing with new opportunities, and Arctic Pablo Coin (APC) is emerging as the frontrunner. While Apu Apustaja and Degen continue making headlines, one project is capturing the spotlight with its groundbreaking approach. Arctic Pablo Coin (APC) is redefining meme coin economics with its unique presale strategy and aggressive token burn mechanism. With its journey reaching Frosty Falls, early investors are witnessing unprecedented growth. This article will cover the latest developments in Arctic Pablo Coin, Apu Apustaja, and Degen. Arctic Pablo Coin’s Deflationary Strategy – Token Burns Fuel Scarcity Scarcity drives value, and Arctic Pablo Coin ($APC), the best meme coin to buy , is proving this with its game-changing burn mechanism. By eliminating unsold tokens weekly during the presale, the project ensures a constantly decreasing supply, amplifying demand and potential price appreciation. Once the presale ends, all remaining tokens will be burned, creating a deflationary effect that benefits holders. The burn transactions are publicly recorded on Binance Smart Chain (BSC), adding transparency and trust to the process. Unlike traditional meme coins that flood the market with excessive supply, Arctic Pablo Coin is setting a new standard in crypto economics. With its current presale price at just $0.000074 and a projected launch price of $0.008, the upside potential is staggering. Presale Surge: Arctic Pablo’s Journey Reaches Frosty Falls Arctic Pablo’s adventure has reached its 14th phase, Frosty Falls, and momentum is stronger than ever. With over $1.88 million raised and a price of just $0.000074 per APC, early adopters are sitting on a potential ROI of 10,694.59%. This journey-based Arctic Palo Meme Coin presale model, where each new location marks a price increase, has created an electrifying buying frenzy. Investors have a limited window to secure APC at this low price before Arctic Pablo moves to its next destination. The opportunity to enter before the next price jump is dwindling, making this phase one of the most critical moments for those looking to maximize gains. Arctic Pablo Coin’s Staking & Rewards – Passive Income for Investors Holding Arctic Pablo Coin isn’t just about potential price appreciation—it’s also about earning passive income. The project offers a 66% APY during the presale, allowing investors to stake their tokens and earn rewards before the coin even launches. Additionally, Arctic Pablo Coin incentivizes community participation through referral bonuses and competitions. Those who spread the word about the project can earn APC tokens or USD rewards. With such lucrative incentives, it’s no surprise that Arctic Pablo is rapidly gaining traction among crypto enthusiasts. Apu Apustaja’s Latest Breakthrough – New Utility Unveiled Apu Apustaja, another prominent meme coin, has introduced a new utility feature designed to enhance its ecosystem. The latest update includes a governance mechanism that allows token holders to vote on community-driven initiatives. This move positions Apu Apustaja as more than just a meme token, adding long-term value for investors. While Apu Apustaja’s roadmap is evolving, its growth trajectory is still being tested. Meanwhile, Arctic Pablo Coin’s presale remains the most talked-about opportunity in the meme coin space. Degen’s Rapid Expansion – Major Exchange Listing Confirmed Degen, a favorite among risk-taking investors, has secured a major exchange listing, boosting its liquidity and accessibility. The listing is expected to drive new interest and trading volume, increasing the coin’s visibility in the crypto market. However, while Degen’s listing news is exciting, Arctic Pablo Coin continues to steal the show with its explosive presale and imminent price surge. Investors looking for the best meme coin to buy are closely watching Arctic Pablo’s next move. Conclusion – Arctic Pablo Coin’s Unstoppable Momentum As the Arctic Pablo Coin presale nears its next phase, investors have a limited chance to lock in at the lowest possible price. With its aggressive token burn strategy, staking rewards, and strategic presale structure, Arctic Pablo is shaping up to be the best meme coin to buy right now. Meanwhile, Apu Apustaja’s governance updates and Degen’s exchange listing add intrigue to the meme coin sector, but neither matches the sheer potential of Arctic Pablo Coin’s ROI projections. With prices set to rise again soon, those looking for the next big crypto opportunity should act now. The journey doesn’t stop at Frosty Falls—Arctic Pablo’s adventure is just getting started!

That November, he tweeted that he was “not a fan of Bitcoin.” He criticized cryptocurrencies for their famously “highly volatile” exchange rates. Furthermore, the former New York City real estate developer claimed their value is “based on thin air.” Well, he wasn’t technically wrong. Bitcoin’s value is based on the work electrons do in highly specialized computer chips to keep a reliable record tracking all BTC wallets on its network. The design behind it is so powerful, and the number of global participants in Web3 is so vast that Bitcoin has become a consistently class-leading financial investment of the century. Alpha ROI, Light Work for Bitcoin From Mar. 1, 2015, ten years ago, until Mar. 1, 2025, earlier this month, Bitcoin’s exchange rate delivered crypto investors a return on investment of 32,146%. Bitcoin’s average daily trading price ten years ago was $261.66, according to data compiled by Yahoo Finance. A decade later that same Bitcoin sold for $84,373.87. That represents an average annualized ROI of 3,214%. Meanwhile, from 2015 to 2025, the broad US stock benchmark S&P 500 Index delivered 182% returns from the 2,105 level to the 5,968. So, by comparison, that’s an average annualized ROI of 18%. The stock returns were enough to keep Boomer dads from touching their savings for decades until their retirement. The crypto returns are life-changing. CNBC reported last August that the Bitcoin price rally had minted 84,000 new cryptocurrency millionaires. While campaigning for reelection in 2024, Trump started to come around on cryptocurrencies. “You probably have to do some regulation,” Trump said in an interview on Fox News. “But many people are embracing it,” he added. “I’m seeing people wanting to pay bitcoin. And you’re seeing something that’s interesting. So, I can live with it one way or the other.” By the time he spoke at the Nashville Bitcoin Conference in July, Trump had completely reversed course on crypto. He promised to fire hostile SEC Chair Gary Gensler on day one, support Bitcoin miners in the United States, and establish a crypto national reserve. Now that Trump has made regulating Bitcoin as a high-priority national resource a signature second-term agenda item, he has become a president of world-historical importance. Bitcoin has rallied for over a year now, and its market cap has risen by over a trillion dollars since 2022. Experts say it could ride as high as $130,000 or even all the way to $700,000, as BlackRock’s Larry Fink mentioned in January. Here are five ways the 45th and 47th president of the United States is unleashing Bitcoin’s hitherto trillion-dollar bull run for more price support in 2025. 1. Digital Asset Stockpile Trump and some Republicans like Wyoming Senator Cynthia Lummis (R) have been talking about a national Bitcoin reserve for months now. The president promised he would deliver one on the campaign trail. Then, after taking office, he pivoted to calling it a digital asset stockpile, hinting that he would include other cryptos in the reserve. Then, in the first week of March, he announced that the US would stockpile XRP, ETH, SOL, and ADA in addition to Bitcoin. After that, he signed an executive order establishing a federal digital asset stockpile on Mar. 6. The next day, he held the first-ever White House crypto summit. TIME Magazine said the crypto industry “is in charge” now. Sergey Nazarov, co-founder of Chainlink, a firm that provides blockchain data, attended the summit and said , “The government representatives expressed that there has been a negative regime towards the crypto industry and that regime is now coming to an end.” “There’s a significant shift and huge amounts of support,” Nazarov said. 2. Ft. Knox Audit Big on Trump’s itinerary this year is a highly anticipated visit with Elon Musk to Fort Knox to inspect the nation’s gold reserves. Washington has reportedly not checked in for decades to count up a $400 billion gold stockpile. According to the US Mint, there are about 147.3 million ounces of gold in the ultra-secure facility there. Interestingly, Trump and Musk continue to repeat the line that they are going there to check if the gold is even there in the first place or if it has been stolen in the years since the government last checked in. Speaking on the Joe Rogan program on Feb. 28, Musk said, “A live tour of Fort Knox would be awesome … is the gold there or not? They say it is — is it real? Or did somebody spray paint some lead?” He previously tweeted , “Looking for the gold at Ft. Knox … Annnnd it’s gone. This gold is the property of the American people. I sure hope it’s still there!” Trump said , “We’re actually going to Fort Knox to see if the gold is there, because maybe somebody stole the gold. Tonnes of gold.” It’s a strong talking point in favor of Bitcoin as digital gold, because unlike gold, Web3 keeps track of digital assets on the blockchain 24 hours a day in real time. 3. Federal Reserve Audit A Federal Reserve audit would be the holy grail of the sound money movement in the United States. 12-term congressman Ron Paul (R-TX) and his army of Internet supporters have advocated for it for years. Musk is reportedly pushing Paul for Federal Reserve chair. In February, the DOGE officer said , “All aspects of the government must be fully transparent and accountable to the people. No exceptions, including, if not especially, the Federal Reserve.” Fed Chairman Jerome Powell says such an audit would be designed “to be a step on the way to eliminating the Fed.” While that would be an unlikely scenario, the chair’s concern shows the seriousness of the blockchain industry’s ascendancy with the support of the Trump Administration. The blockchain ethos of transparency and accountability is putting pressure like never before on the central banking system in the United States. Meanwhile, the Fed is stuck on pause with interest rates. The establishment now understands that every time it lowers rates, Bitcoin’s price soars, and the blockchain soaks up more capital on a macro scale. The US Federal Reserve 4. White House AI Crypto ‘Czar’ When he was still opposed to crypto, Trump cited concerns about “unlawful behavior” and “other illegal activity.” While he was still president, Barack Obama compared Bitcoin to a “Swiss bank account in your pocket.” However, US and global law enforcement agencies have found that the openness and transparency of the blockchain make it far easier to investigate financial crimes and frauds using cryptocurrency than working with corporate banks. The evidence of crimes leaves a trail on the blockchain, and police experts can obtain it and use it in court to secure verdicts for criminals who are guilty. Trump’s pick of David Sacks for White House AI and crypto czar shows how seriously he talks about financial crimes using blockchain. Sacks has strong connections to US deep state policing agencies as the COO at PayPal under Peter Thiel, who also founded Palantir, one of the Department of Homeland Security’s key contractors in the digital era. 5. Crypto Friendly SEC So far, in the federal scrum to regulate cryptocurrencies, there has been no bigger threat than the SEC under Chairman Gary Gensler and his predecessor, Jay Clayton. Clayton started over 80 cryptocurrency cases as SEC chair, and Gensler brought over 100 cases against Web3 companies. Under Donald Trump, the SEC is closing out its cases against crypto companies like Coinbase and Consensys . A final ruling in the years-long SEC case against Ripple Labs is slated for April 16th. That could be an important date for XRP price markets and for the whole ecosystem, including BTC.

With so many options out there, choosing the right cryptocurrency can feel like finding a needle in a haystack. Among the crypto giants, Cardano and Solana have made waves with their revolutionary technologies and consistent performance. However, there’s a new player in town—Qubetics ($TICS)—and it might just be the next big thing that surpasses all expectations. Let’s dive into the latest advancements of these coins and discover what sets Qubetics apart, especially in its presale phase. Cardano and Solana have been praised for their scalability and energy-efficient protocols, creating decentralized systems that promise fast and secure transactions. But here’s the catch: while they have accomplished much, their systems still face limitations when it comes to seamless integration and supporting a wide range of real-world applications. That’s where Qubetics ($TICS) comes in. With its revolutionary Non-Custodial Multi-Chain Wallet and real-world tokenization features, Qubetics aims to solve issues that Cardano and Solana can’t. Plus, its exciting presale is already creating major buzz, and early buyers are in for a potentially life-changing opportunity. If you’re looking to invest in the best crypto presale, Qubetics should definitely be on your radar. Qubetics: The Top Rated Crypto with Real-World Applications Qubetics isn’t just another crypto project—it’s a world-first Web3 aggregator that connects multiple blockchains to make digital transactions seamless, secure, and scalable, solidifying its place as one of the top rated crypto options. One of its most powerful applications is its Non-Custodial Multi-Chain Wallet, designed to allow users and businesses alike to manage their assets effortlessly across various blockchain networks. Imagine being able to use different cryptocurrencies and digital assets in one unified wallet, without the hassle of switching between wallets or platforms. This could change everything for businesses in e-commerce, finance, and even real estate, making Qubetics an exciting contender in the race for the best crypto presale. For example, a small business owner in the U.S. could use Qubetics to streamline payments across multiple blockchain networks, cutting down on transaction fees and delays. A real estate agency could tokenize properties, allowing buyers and sellers to transact in a way that’s transparent, secure, and accessible to anyone, anywhere in the world. The ability to integrate both fiat and cryptocurrency payments within the same platform is a game-changer. Furthermore, as a non-custodial wallet, Qubetics ensures that users retain control over their funds, minimizing the risk of hacks or fraudulent activities—a problem that has plagued many other platforms. Qubetics offers a real-world solution to a problem that many people and businesses face today. Whether you’re an individual trying to manage your crypto assets efficiently or a business looking for more flexible payment solutions, Qubetics has your back. And, as the presale continues to heat up, it’s clear that this top rated crypto is set to change the way we think about digital asset management. Qubetics Presale ROI and Investment Potential: Why It’s a Must for Early Adopters As the Qubetics presale continues, the ROI projections are looking more promising than ever. If you’re searching for the best crypto presale to get into, the $TICS token might be exactly what you’ve been waiting for. At the current 25th presale stage price of $0.1074, early buyers are already seeing significant gains. Let’s break it down: if you buy $TICS now, you could see a return of over 130% if the price reaches $0.25, which is within reach by the end of the presale. But it doesn’t stop there—should $TICS hit $1, early adopters could be looking at a whopping 830% ROI. Those with the foresight to hold onto their tokens post-mainnet launch could see returns as high as 13,859% at $15. This is why Qubetics is fast becoming one of the top rated crypto projects to watch, and why its presale is generating so much buzz in the crypto community. Don’t miss out on the chance to join this crypto presale while the prices are still low! Take an example: if you decide to invest $25,000 at today’s price of $0.1074, you would receive 232,843 $TICS tokens. If the price increases to $1 at the end of the presale, your investment would be worth $232,843—an ROI of over 830%. With a projected price of $5, that same $25,000 investment would balloon to over $1.16 million, making the potential upside of Qubetics hard to ignore. This is the kind of opportunity that savvy early adopters don’t want to miss out on, especially when considering the price hikes every Sunday at midnight. And the clock is ticking. The Qubetics presale only lasts for 7 days at each stage, with a 10% price increase every time a new stage begins. Currently in Stage 25, Qubetics has raised over $15 million, with more than 23,000 token holders and over 499 million $TICS tokens sold. It’s a presale that’s building momentum fast, and for those looking to join the best crypto presale out there, this could be the chance of a lifetime. Cardano: A Blockchain for the Future of Finance Cardano has long been recognized as one of the top rated crypto projects, with its commitment to creating a decentralized and sustainable blockchain platform. Its recent developments have focused on enhancing smart contract capabilities and integrating decentralized applications (dApps). With the launch of its Alonzo upgrade, Cardano introduced smart contracts to its platform, allowing developers to build dApps that are secure, scalable, and efficient. This move placed Cardano in direct competition with Ethereum as a go-to blockchain for decentralized finance (DeFi). Despite these advancements, Cardano’s main drawback is its slower development pace. While Ethereum and Solana continue to push the envelope with faster transaction speeds, Cardano has often been criticized for being too conservative in its approach. However, its unique Ouroboros proof-of-stake algorithm sets it apart from other blockchain platforms, offering a more eco-friendly alternative. This could be a major selling point for environmentally conscious community members who are looking for a blockchain that minimizes energy consumption. Cardano’s focus on academic research and peer-reviewed protocols makes it one of the most secure blockchain platforms in the world. However, as more and more competitors enter the space, it will be interesting to see how Cardano adapts to the evolving demands of the cryptocurrency market. For now, it remains one of the top rated crypto options for those who prioritize security and sustainability. Solana: Speed and Scalability at Its Core Solana is another top rated crypto that has been making waves due to its speed and scalability. With a transaction speed of over 65,000 transactions per second (TPS), Solana is one of the fastest blockchains in existence today. Its ability to scale efficiently without compromising speed has attracted numerous DeFi projects, NFT creators, and developers. Solana’s consensus mechanism, Proof of History (PoH), allows for faster and more secure transactions, making it a popular choice among developers looking to build decentralized applications. However, despite its impressive speed, Solana has faced challenges with network stability. The blockchain has experienced several outages in the past, leading to concerns about its long-term reliability. While the Solana team has been working hard to address these issues, network downtime remains a potential risk for community members who rely on the blockchain for mission-critical applications. Solana’s rapid growth has led to increased competition among other blockchains, with many projects looking to replicate its high-speed capabilities. But as Solana continues to scale and improve its infrastructure, it remains one of the top rated crypto coins for anyone looking for high-performance blockchain solutions. Conclusion: Which Crypto Is the Top Rated Crypto for You? When it comes to choosing the top rated crypto, each project offers something unique. Cardano’s secure and eco-friendly blockchain has established it as a leader in decentralized finance, while Solana’s lightning-fast transactions and scalability make it an attractive option for developers. But Qubetics ($TICS) is emerging as the one to watch, thanks to its innovative non-custodial wallet and seamless integration across multiple blockchains. With its upcoming mainnet launch and the current presale offering incredible returns, Qubetics has the potential to redefine the crypto landscape. If you’re looking to get in on a project that solves real-world problems and promises massive returns, now is the time to consider Qubetics. Don’t miss out on the chance to join this crypto presale and become part of the next big thing in crypto. The presale is in full swing, and with every stage bringing higher prices, it’s clear that Qubetics is on track to deliver incredible value to early participants.

According to SoSoValue data, cumulative inflows now stand at $35.20 billion, only $200 million higher than on January 2, reflecting a significant cooling of investor enthusiasm. The decline is largely attributed to five days of net positive inflows in February and only a single day of gains in March, suggesting that the initial wave of capital allocation into these funds may have reached its peak. Bitcoin ETF Inflows Nearly Wiped Out As Bitcoin’s price struggled through February, the total value of Bitcoin ETF assets under management (AUM) has dropped nearly 25% from its all-time high at the end of January. “Many of the investors who were eager to gain exposure to digital assets through ETFs have already entered the market,” explained BRN analyst Valentin Fournier. He added that for inflows to pick up again, either fresh demand must emerge or a broader market catalyst is needed. Interestingly, while Bitcoin’s price has gained about 10% since Tuesday, boosting ETF valuations slightly, the funds themselves continue to log net-negative outflows, indicating that existing investors may still be taking profits or reallocating capital elsewhere. Altcoin ETFs Race for Regulatory Approval As Bitcoin ETF funds struggle to maintain momentum, asset managers are now shifting focus toward launching altcoin ETFs, hoping to attract fresh capital into the crypto investment space. Firms have also proposed funds tracking Polkadot (DOT), Axelar (AXL), Avalanche (AVAX), and other altcoins, aiming to capture interest in the broader digital asset market. Among the contenders, Litecoin, XRP, Solana, and Dogecoin ETFs are viewed as the most likely to receive regulatory approval, given their relatively higher market adoption and liquidity. This push for altcoin ETFs reflects a broader diversification trend in the crypto investment landscape, as institutional and retail investors alike look beyond Bitcoin for new opportunities. However, approval from regulators remains a hurdle, with no clear timeline on when—or if—these funds will get the green light.

Durov had been required to remain in the country since his arrest seven months ago. According to CoinGlass data , Toncoin’s OI—a measure of unsettled derivative contracts such as futures and options—climbed to $169 million on March 15, marking its highest level since February 1, when it stood at $171.49 million. Durov’s Departure Sparks Speculation on Toncoin’s Future The spike followed reports of Durov’s departure, fueling speculation about its impact on the Toncoin ecosystem. Toncoin (TON) serves as the native cryptocurrency of The Open Network, which underpins Telegram’s Mini App ecosystem. The token’s price also responded positively, gaining 17% within the same period to trade at $3.45, according to CoinMarketCap data. Market analysts are closely watching the rally, with trading resource Crypto Billion suggesting that TON is entering a long-term accumulation phase near key support levels. However, concerns remain over potential volatility. If the price dips back to the $3 mark, nearly $18.8 million in long positions could be liquidated. Durov’s reported relocation to Dubai—a jurisdiction with no extradition agreements with several countries—has sparked discussions about regulatory scrutiny in the crypto space. TON Foundation Celebrates Pavel Durov's Passport Return TON Foundation is delighted to learn that Pavel Durov's passport has been returned to him by French authorities, granting him the freedom to leave the country at his discretion. This news marks a significant moment of… pic.twitter.com/KkNG7UnJBg — TON (@ton_blockchain) March 15, 2025 His arrest in France in August 2024 raised concerns about increased enforcement against privacy-focused platforms, with authorities alleging that Telegram facilitated illicit transactions. Historical data suggests a pattern of market reaction linked to Durov’s legal troubles. Following his arrest on August 24, 2024, Toncoin’s OI surged by 32%, though its price dropped by almost 12%. Meanwhile, Telegram has recently tightened its blockchain strategy. In January, the company announced it would discontinue support for all blockchains except The Open Network, reinforcing its commitment to the TON ecosystem. Telegram Complies with More US Requests for User Data Following CEO’s Arrest in France As reported, Telegram fulfilled 900 requests from U.S. authorities for user information in 2024, with a significant increase in inquiries following the arrest of its CEO, Pavel Durov, in France. The platform provided information such as IP addresses and phone numbers for 14 requests between January and September. However, the total number of requests for the year reached 900, affecting 2,253 users, indicating a sharp rise after October. Durov was arrested on August 24 by French authorities on allegations that Telegram had been used to facilitate criminal activity. In October, he acknowledged that the platform has been sharing user data with authorities upon request since 2018, a practice outlined in Telegram’s privacy policy. Notably, the encrypted messaging platform’s latest update allows users to upgrade gifts into non-fungible tokens (NFTs), enabling trading and ownership on blockchain platforms. As reported, the new feature transforms digital gifts into unique collectible items with customizable attributes, which can be exchanged or sold on NFT marketplaces . The gift custom attributes include background colors and icons, ensuring each item is distinct. Upgrading requires Telegram Stars, the platform’s digital currency, to cover blockchain fees.

Hackers took control of the account and falsely claimed that Kaito AI’s wallets had been compromised, warning users that their funds were at risk. The misleading posts, which have since been deleted, aimed to incite panic among investors. Hackers Allegedly Shorted KAITO Before Spreading False Alerts According to blockchain investigator DeFi Warhol, the attackers allegedly opened a short position on KAITO tokens before posting the misleading messages. Their goal was to trigger a sell-off, causing the token’s price to plummet and allowing them to profit from the artificial downturn. Shortly after the breach, the Kaito AI team regained control of the compromised account and reassured users that their wallets remained secure. In a statement, the team emphasized that they had implemented strong security measures to prevent such incidents, adding that the attack appeared similar to other recent social media breaches affecting crypto-related accounts. Hackers are getting smarter. They didn't tweet a stupid CA and closed the replies like the majority do. Instead, they shorted before tweeting a seemingly legit tweet concerning the $KAITO supply. Perhaps also longed when they lost access. https://t.co/qRYmCQNWQK pic.twitter.com/R7kaMr09fy — DeFi Warhol (@Defi_Warhol) March 15, 2025 The incident is part of a growing trend of cyberattacks targeting the crypto industry. On February 26, the X account of Pump.fun, a fair-launch platform, was hijacked by a hacker who used it to promote fraudulent tokens, including a fake governance token. Blockchain researcher ZackXBT later linked the attack to similar breaches involving the Jupiter DAO and DogWifCoin X accounts. Cybercriminals Ramp Up Sophisticated Scams to Target Investors Cybercriminals are also employing more sophisticated scams to deceive investors. On March 7, the Alberta Securities Commission warned the public about a fraudulent crypto scheme called CanCap, which used fabricated news articles and fake endorsements from Canadian politicians, including Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, to lure victims. The scam played on concerns about a potential trade war between Canada and the U.S. Meanwhile, security experts are warning of a new threat linked to the North Korean state-sponsored Lazarus Group. Hackers posing as venture capitalists are reportedly luring targets into Zoom meetings, where they claim to have technical issues and redirect victims to a malicious chatroom. There, they encourage users to download a so-called “patch,” which contains malware designed to steal crypto private keys and other sensitive data. In February 2025, losses in the crypto ecosystem increased by 20x month-over-month compared with January 2025, according to the latest report by major blockchain security platform Immunefi . In January, registered losses stood at $73,915,700. Just a month later, this figure jumped to $1,528,342,400. The latter was the result of nine hacks. Additionally, the February number is an 18x increase from the same time a year prior. In February 2024, registered losses were $81,603,400.

The leading cryptocurrency has not traded above $90,000 for over a week, raising concerns among traders about whether the bull market has lost momentum and how long selling pressure will persist. Bitcoin’s Basis Rate Signals Stability Despite Price Decline Despite a 30% drop from its all-time high of $109,354 on January 20, Bitcoin’s derivatives market suggests resilience. The Bitcoin basis rate, which measures the premium of monthly contracts over spot markets, has rebounded after briefly signaling bearish sentiment on March 13. Traders typically demand a 5% to 10% annualized premium to compensate for longer settlement periods, and while Bitcoin’s current 5% basis rate is below the 8% recorded two weeks ago, it remains within neutral territory. This suggests that leveraged buyers are still engaged in the market, though with reduced confidence. Bitcoin’s price movement has closely tracked the S&P 500 , challenging the long-held notion that the asset is non-correlated with traditional markets. As global economic uncertainties persist, investors appear to be reducing exposure to risk-on assets like Bitcoin and moving into safer investments, such as short-term bonds. However, central banks are expected to implement stimulus measures to prevent a recession, a move that could favor Bitcoin as a scarce asset. According to the CME FedWatch tool, markets currently see a less than 40% probability of U.S. interest rates falling below 3.75% from the current 4.25% baseline ahead of the July 30 Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting. Bitcoin is the new digital gold right? pic.twitter.com/nXkoVMxiJy — Ted (@TedPillows) March 15, 2025 If economic concerns ease and the stock market stabilizes, Bitcoin could reclaim the $90,000 level. However, if panic selling continues, risk assets may face further pressure, and Bitcoin could struggle in the coming months—especially if spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) experience continued net outflows. Bitcoin Derivatives Show No Signs of Bearish Stress Despite recent market fluctuations, Bitcoin derivatives remain stable. The 25% delta skew, a key metric for options traders, indicates that professional traders are not actively hedging against further downside. This suggests that the market does not anticipate Bitcoin falling to $76,900 in the near future. During bullish periods, put (sell) options typically trade at a 6% or higher discount, while bearish conditions push this metric to a 6% premium. While brief spikes in bearish sentiment were observed on March 10 and March 12, the delta skew has remained within a neutral range, signaling a healthy derivatives market. Bitcoin’s margin market further reflects investor confidence. At OKX, the long-to-short margin ratio currently stands at 18:1 , indicating strong bullish positioning. Historically, extreme confidence pushes this ratio above 40:1, while levels below 5:1 are seen as bearish. The current ratio mirrors sentiment from January 30, when Bitcoin was trading above $100,000. Over $920 million in leveraged long futures contracts were liquidated in the seven days leading up to March 13, adding to short-term volatility. However, Bitcoin’s derivatives and margin markets show no significant signs of stress, suggesting that investor sentiment remains strong.

He argued that the U.S.’ support of cryptocurrencies and non-bank finance would lead to another financial crisis. In an interview with the French weekly La Tribune Dimanche, Villeroy said that “the United States risks sinning through negligence.” The French senior civil servant also highlighted that European supervision was better secured and argued that there was no risk of a banking crisis in the EU. Villeroy believes the U.S. will bring the next financial crisis European Central Bank Governing Council member Francois Villeroy de Galhau believes that the U.S. risks bringing about the next financial collapse. The ECB member said that the state’s backing of virtual currencies and non-bank finance will cause a financial emergency. Financial crises often originate in the United States and spread to the rest of the world. By encouraging crypto-assets and non-bank finance, the American administration is sowing the seeds of future upheavals.” -Francois Villeroy de Galhau, European Central Bank Governing Council member. The banker also maintained that the euro should be more important internationally. Villeroy believes that Europe needs to “build a powerful savings and investment union, capable of attracting international investors to our currency.” The Governor of the Banque de France said that digital assets could generate even greater savings for the financial industry and end-users. U.S. President Donald Trump championed digital assets during last year’s campaign, and he has kept part of his promises. Trump signed an executive order calling for the establishment of a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve and a separate stockpile of other digital currencies. Since former Gary Gensler resigned when Trump took office, the Securities and Exchange Commission has dropped around a dozen legal actions against digital asset firms. Translated post about European Central Bank Governing Council member Francois Villeroy de Galhau’s interview with the French weekly La Tribune Dimanche. Source: La Tribune Dimanche (X/Twitter) Villeroy champions digital assets in Europe In January, the European banker said that asset tokenization is another groundswell movement that could enhance trade and post-trade activities. Villeroy argued that asset tokenization paved the way for another acceleration with the widespread implementation of T+0 (ensuring settlement within the same day of transaction execution). The European Securities and Market Authority (ESMA) proposed in May last year that the European Commission and the co-legislators assess the opportunity for a European-wide supervision of digital asset service providers. The French civil servant argued that a direct supervision mechanism would enable more effective oversight of the crypto industry and provide better protection for European investors in the long run. Villeroy noted that Europe had made the right step by adopting the MiCA regulation. He argued that “failing to regulate crypto-assets and non-banks today would merely sow the seeds for tomorrow’s financial crisis.” The Banque de France’s governor said on May 6, 2024, that central banks would need both wholesale and retail digital currencies. He maintained that central banks needed to take risks rather than wait for “absolute certainty” on new technology. Villeroy told an event at the Bank for International Settlement (BIS) that central banks in Europe shouldn’t “lag behind” on technology such as tokenization. Villeroy added that a central bank digital currency would ensure convertibility between tokenized assets and serve as a reliable basis of trust for the new technologies to realize their full potential. A research from the European Central Bank found that most consumers would not take up the digital euro if they were given the choice. ECB said that the key motivation for setting up a digital euro regarded the declining use and acceptance of cash in day-to-day payments and increasing digitalisation of the payment landscape. Panelists at the ECB and Its Watchers conference also agreed on March 12 that the European Central Bank’s policy framework did not need altering despite changes in external circumstances.

Hayden Davis, the co-creator of the Official Melania Meme (MELANIA) and the Libra token, has launched a new Solana-based memecoin, with an over 80% insider supply. Davis launched the Wolf (WOLF) memecoin on March 8, banking on rumors of Jordan Belfort, known as the Wolf of Wall Street, launching his own token. The token reached a peak $42 million market cap, however, 82% of the WOLF token’s supply was bundled under the same entity, according to a March 15 X post by Bubblemaps , which wrote: “The bubble map revealed something strange — $WOLF had the same pattern as $HOOD, a token launched by Hayden Davis. Was he behind this one too?” Source: Bubblemaps The blockchain analytics platform revealed transfers across 17 different addresses stemming back to address ‘OxcEAe’ owned by Davis. “He funded these wallets months before $LIBRA and $WOLF launched, moving money through 17 addresses and 2 chains,” Bubblemaps added.

WOLF/SOL, market cap, 1-hour chart. Source: Dexscreener Davies’ latest token launch comes weeks after the Libra token’s collapse where eight insider wallets cashed out $107 million in liquidity , leading to a $4 billion market cap wipeout within hours. The Libra token turned into a political issue, with Argentinian President Javier Milei risking impeachment after his endorsement of the Libra coin. Argentine lawyer Gregorio Dalbon has asked for an Interpol Red Notice to be issued for Davis citing a “procedural risk” if Davis remained free as he could have access to vast amounts of money that would allow him to either flee the US or go into hiding. Related: Milei-endorsed Libra token was ‘open secret’ in memecoin circles — Jupiter Memecoins are turning into “retail value extraction tools” Memecoins are turning against crypto’s fundamental ethos of decentralization, becoming increasingly used to exploit retail investors amid the growing number of rug pulls, according to Anastasija Plotnikova, co-founder and CEO of blockchain regulatory firm Fideum. “Memecoins have evolved from community-driven social experiments into a chaotic landscape dominated by value extraction from retail investors,” Plotnikova told Cointelegraph, adding: “Insider rings, pump-and-dump schemes, and sniper groups have replaced the organic, collectible nature of original memecoins, creating an unhealthy playing field.” Related: TRUMP, DOGE, BONK ETF approvals ‘more likely’ under new SEC leadership Investors will also need to distinguish between memecoins that can be seen as genuine “collectibles” and “outright fraudulent activities” like rug pulls which are “not only unethical but also clearly illegal, with case law to support enforcement.” “In my view, these activities should fall firmly within the jurisdiction of law enforcement agencies,” she added. United States regulators are becoming increasingly aware of the growing memecoin scams. A New York lawmaker introduced a bill that would establish criminal penalties specifically aimed at preventing cryptocurrency fraud and protecting investors from rug pulls, Cointelegraph reported on March 6. Under the proposal, new criminal charges would be created for offenses involving “virtual token fraud,” explicitly targeting deceptive practices associated with cryptocurrencies.

Michael Saylor’s Strategy has also accumulated more Bitcoins in the past few months, a sign that it expects the price to rebound.

This is possible, but it will depend on two key catalysts. First, the market needs to adjust to President Donald Trump’s tariffs . This explains why U.S. equities jumped on Friday, with the Dow Jones and Nasdaq 100 indices rising by 674 and 450 points, respectively. Historically, the stock market overreacts when there is a black swan event and rebounds afterward. A good example was during the COVID-19 pandemic when they crashed and bounced back. Second, the Federal Reserve needs to embrace a dovish tone now that the odds of the U.S. economy contracting in the first quarter have risen. The Atlanta FedNow tool estimates that the U.S. GDP will contract by 2.4% in Q1. A dovish Fed will likely lead to a risk-on sentiment and push Bitcoin and altcoin prices higher.

The flagship cryptocurrency dipped below $80,000 earlier in the week, falling to a low of $76,985. It rebounded from this level to retake $85,000 as markets bounced on Friday before declining to its current level. BTC has been marginally down over the past 24 hours as macroeconomic factors weigh on investor sentiment. New Bill To Build Bitcoin Reserve A new House bill introduced by Trump ally Rep. Byron Donalds (R-FL) would enshrine into law President Donald Trump’s proposed Strategic Bitcoin Reserve. However, the bill has one critical difference from the legislation introduced in the Senate earlier this week. Unlike the Bitcoin Act proposed by Senator Cynthia Lummis, which would commit the US government to buy Bitcoin, Donald’s Reserve and Stockpile Act does not call for the purchase of Bitcoin. Instead, the proposed legislation would codify into federal law Trump’s recent executive order calling for a strategic Bitcoin reserve and Digital Asset Stockpile. Donalds said in a statement, “For years, the Democrats waged war on crypto. Now is the time for Congressional Republicans to decisively end this war.” The legislation also mirrors the language in Trump’s executive order, which states the Bitcoin Reserve and Digital Asset Stockpile be seeded by assets seized during criminal and civil proceedings. Similarly, the bill authorizes the Treasury Secretary and Commerce Secretary to look for “budget neutral” ways of acquiring Bitcoin and other assets. White House officials have used similar language when discussing potential purchases of BTC by the federal government. The government possesses nearly 200,000 BTC from civil and criminal forfeiture. The proposal by Donalds gives the White House a less contentious avenue to codify its Bitcoin Reserve into law without compelling the government from buying up billions worth of BTC . Is The Bull Run Over? Bitcoin (BTC) is struggling to break above the $84,000-$85,000 level. The flagship cryptocurrency is down over 10% year-to-date, down from around $94,000 on January 1 to its current level. One analyst shared an analysis that showed BTC is beginning to break below a critical support that has held strong for over a decade. If BTC stays below this level for weeks or months, it could signal the end of the current bull run. The flagship crypto’s underperformance is evident in significantly lower capital inflows into Bitcoin exchange-traded funds. Data from SoSoValue revealed that spot Bitcoin ETFs experienced almost $1.5 billion in net outflows year-to-date. BTC’s underperformance compared to gold casts doubt on the longevity of the bull market, with the crypto market cap declining over $600 billion to $2.74 trillion since the beginning of the year. Bitcoin (BTC) Still The Market’s Best Bet Fundstrat co-founder and managing partner Tom Lee remains optimistic about Bitcoin’s price trajectory this year. He also maintained a positive outlook on Donald Trump’s economic policies, stating that from a “shorter lens,” Trump’s actions look “very disruptive at the moment.” However, he argued that the structural impact of these decisions would be very positive. Lee also stated that despite market volatility, there are tangible drivers of productivity at play. He also reaffirmed his belief that BTC will be the top-performing asset in 2025. “Bitcoin is still our favorite idea for this year. So we think it’ll be the best-performing asset class, even better than gold.” Bitcoin (BTC) Price Analysis Bitcoin (BTC) has struggled in recent sessions, as it remains pinned below $85,000 despite a jump on Friday that briefly took the price above $85,000. However, analysts still believe the flagship asset can retrace its way back to $100,000, with a reversal likely in the near future. According to one analyst, BTC was eying a rally above $100,000, with $91,700, $102,700, and $109,356 the potential levels it could hit when it pivots toward $100,000. A rally to $109,356 would mark a new all-time high for the asset. BTC made a strong recovery after dropping to a low of $81,500 last Tuesday, rising nearly 4% on Wednesday to reclaim $90,000 and settle at $90,639. However, it lost momentum after reaching this level and registered a marginal decline on Wednesday, slipping below $90,000 and settling at $89,957. Bearish sentiment intensified on Thursday as the price dropped nearly 4% to $86,781, but not before hitting an intraday low of $84,722. Price action remained bearish over the weekend as BTC registered a marginal decline on Saturday and settled at $85,267. Selling pressure intensified on Sunday as BTC plunged below the 200-day SMA and $80,000 on its way to an intraday low of $79,987 before recovering to settle at $80,736. Source: TradingView Buyers attempted a recovery on Monday as BTC surged to an intraday high of $84,075. However, it lost momentum after reaching this level and dropped nearly 3%, slipping below $80,000 and settling at $77,414. BTC fell to an intraday low of $76,642 on Tuesday as selling pressure intensified. It rebounded from this level to reclaim $80,000 and settle at $82,943, ultimately registering an increase of 5.50%. Buyers retained control on Wednesday despite selling pressure, rising almost 1% to $83,709. However, BTC fell back into the red on Thursday, dropping over 3% and settling at $81,136. The crypto markets registered a sharp bounce on Friday as bullish sentiment returned. As a result, BTC rose nearly 4% to move past the 200-day SMA, reaching an intraday high of $85,363 before settling at $84,002. Buyers retained control on Saturday as BTC registered a marginal increase and settled at $84,398. However, the price is back in the red during the current session, down over 2% and trading below the 200-day SMA at $82,652. If BTC continues to decline and slips below $80,000, it could drop towards $75,000. On the other hand, buyers will look to retake control and push the price back above the moving averages and the $90,000 price level. The MACD has turned bearish, indicating BTC could see an uptick in the near term. However, BTC has seen a substantial fall during the current session, with the price dipping below $83,000.

Historically, the firstborn crypto experienced a deep correction in 2011 when the BTC declined to 92% from its high at that time. Has The Crash Begun? In an X post, McGlone suggested Bitcoin’s crash to $10,000 may have already started, citing that risk markets are showing signs of overheating while gold rises. The analyst explained that gold has increased by 1% while Bitcoin went down, saying, “But with Bitcoin at about $80,000, what stops those trajectories?” “About a 6% decline in the S&P 500 could suggest what matters. The biggest #ETF launch in history, President Donald Trump’s shift to highly volatile and speculative #cryptos, and reelection could prove [a] peak-bubble akin to about 25 years ago,” he added in a post, suggesting that BTC might have reached the peak of a dot-com-style bubble. Rebuttal Of The Analysis Many Bitcoin proponents and analysts disagree with McGlone’s analysis, with one crypto analyst, David Weisberger countering the evaluation of the Bloomberg analyst, saying his assessment was flawed.

Table of Contents Solana struggles to hold above $140 Rexas Finance presale dominates crypto talk with $47m raised Conclusion Strong resistance at important price points has prevented Solana (SOL) from achieving a continuous climb. The token has been battling to recapture its optimistic momentum. With slow on-chain activity and diminishing whale accumulation, observers wonder if Solana can overcome its present challenges — or if further downside lies ahead. Amid SOL’s difficulties, another altcoin has been capturing the spotlight: Rexas Finance (RXS). This trending token is joining the real-world asset (RWA) tokenization niche as experts tag it the next big thing in the crypto space. Solana struggles to hold above $140 Solana’s price has been under pressure, plunging from $180 in February to current levels below $140. Data shows that Solana’s network fees have dropped 73% in the last month, indicating fewer on-chain activities. The futures market presents a similar picture. SOL perpetual futures funding rates have been negative for three days, showing that short sellers are paying to keep their positions — a sign of low demand for leveraged longs. Worryingly, whale accumulation has stalled. The number of Solana wallets with at least 10,000 SOL decreased from 5,053 to 5,023, indicating that some major investors may be taking profits or lowering exposure. While some traders anticipate the introduction of a Solana spot ETF in the United States will act as a catalyst for a significant surge, Solana’s ability to overcome its $155 resistance level remains uncertain.

As of this report, the RXS presale is in its final stage (Stage 12), with 91% of the allocated tokens already sold. As the launch approaches, investors are hurrying to secure their share. The presale momentum shows investor trust in Rexas Finance’s tokenized real-world asset (RWA) ecosystem. This ecosystem lets users invest in high-value assets like real estate, commodities, and art, fractionalizing them for affordability. Thanks to its accessibility, Rexas Finance has surpassed 50,000 active users, a crucial step toward RWA tokenization market dominance. Rexas Finance use cases extend beyond tokenization. The project incorporates a range of DeFi services, including staking, yield farming, and liquidity pooling. This ensures users can earn passively from their holdings. Startup founders also have a fundraising platform in Rexas Launchpad. This tool connects founders, removing the traditional seeding hassles. Rexas Finance has completed a Certik audit, ensuring its smart contracts are secure, durable, and fault-free, attracting long-term investors. To increase interaction, Rexas Finance is conducting a $1 million giveaway, with the top 20 participants receiving $50,000 in RXS. For holders, this offer allows for early profits and strengthens the Rexas Finance community, ensuring long-term ecosystem stability. Rexas Finance’s next milestone is the formal exchange debut on June 19, 2025. The project plans to list on at least three of the top ten global cryptocurrency exchanges, which will improve liquidity, reach, and demand, potentially resulting in RXS token appreciation. The official listing price is $0.25, which positions early presale buyers for immediate gains. Experts foresee a 100,000% post-launch rise, spurred by improved liquidity and new market investors. This makes Rexas Finance one of the most anticipated listings.

The new launch is despite being the subject of an Interpol notice, according to blockchain analytics firm Bubblemaps. In a detailed investigation conducted in collaboration with YouTube investigator Coffeezilla, Bubblemaps traced fund transfers revealing Davis as the creator of WOLF. This is a token that appeared to be associated with Jordan Belfort, a former stockbroker who inspired the Martin Scorsese film “The Wolf of Wall Street.” “In collaboration with Coffeezilla, we exposed Hayden Davis as the mind behind LIBRA, MELANIA, and other tokens. We thought his days of launching tokens were over. But we were wrong,” Bubblemaps stated in their report. Coffeezilla, whose real name is Stephen Findeisen, is a YouTuber known for his exposé videos on the crypto industry. You might also like: Telegram founder Pavel Durov temporarily leaves France amid legal troubles, Toncoin surges Bubblemaps identifies Davis through on-chain analysis WOLF gained popularity after being promoted by a WallStreetBets social media account on March 8. The token quickly reached a $40 million market capitalization before experiencing a price collapse in what appears to be another “rug pull” scheme. Blockchain analysis showed 82% of the token’s supply was controlled in a single bundle, a characteristic pattern in fraudulent token launches. Bubblemaps found out that Davis was behind it through on-chain analysis, tracing several transactions. “Starting with the $WOLF creator 6MsuHd, we followed funding transfers back across 17 addresses and 5 cross-chain transfers. All led to a single address: OxcEAe. The same one owned by Hayden Davis,” the report detailed. The investigation revealed that Davis had prepared for the launch months in advance. “He funded these wallets months before $LIBRA and $WOLF launched, moving money through 17 addresses and 2 chains,” Bubblemaps explained. Davis’s activities have been under international legal scrutiny following his involvement with the LIBRA meme coin. After Milei’s endorsement, LIBRA’s market capitalization briefly surged to over $4.5 billion before collapsing by more than 99% to approximately $18 million. Blockchain analysts subsequently revealed that certain insiders, including Davis, had sold large amounts of the token shortly after Milei’s endorsement. Argentine prosecutor Gregorio Dalbón has requested a judge issue an Interpol “Red Notice” for Davis. The prosecutor cited concerns that his financial resources might allow him to evade justice. The Red Notice would effectively make Davis wanted internationally. For Coffeezilla’s hour-long interview with Davis, see below.

In 2016, 24-year-old Charlie Javice founded a financial aid assistance company called “Frank” and ultimately convinced JPMorgan Chase to buy it for $175 million in 2021. JPMorgan also appointed her as a managing director of the bank after the deal – but Javice only lasted about a year at her new job before accusations of fraud got her fired. In 2022, JPMorgan accused Javice of lying about how many users were on her app, and alleged that she had paid a friend $18,000 – double his hourly rate – to fabricate data in order to convince the bank to make its big investment, according to a Bloomberg report . That friend, data scientist and Queens College professor Adam Kapelner, testified at Javice’s fraud trial in Manhattan federal court this week. The two had met while both were studying at the University of Pennsylvania’s Wharton School. Kapelner told the court that Javice sent him a computer file showing Frank had less than 300,000 real users; he subsequently spent about 22 hours on the project adding 4,265,085 lines of code representing fake users. Kapelner said he never knew what the data was being used for. Said Kapelner, “I asked the purpose of the project, and she said she couldn’t talk about it.” Once she was working at JPMorgan, Javice then hired Kapelner to integrate customer data she’d procured from another marketing company into Frank’s database. According to prosecutors, this move was to cover up her tracks with new data. Javice – now 32 – is being charged securities fraud, wire fraud, bank fraud, and conspiracy, and faces a maximum sentence of 20 years in prison.

A large crypto investor, or whale, has opened a 40x leveraged short position for over 4,442 Bitcoin ( BTC ) worth over $368 million, which functions as a de facto bet on Bitcoin’s price fall. Leveraged positions use borrowed money to increase the size of an investment, which can boost the size of both gains and losses, making leveraged trading riskier compared to regular investment positions.

Earlier in March, a savvy trader gained $68 million on a 50x leveraged short position , banking on Ether’s ( ETH ) 11% price decline.

This announcement comes just days after rumors spread that Jordan Belfort, known as the “Wolf of Wall Street,” was preparing to launch a token of the same name. Bubblemaps teamed up with YouTuber Coffeezilla to investigate the origins of WOLF and found striking similarities to HOOD, another token previously released by Davis. The firm’s analysis suggests that the designer of the WOLF token has direct links to Davis’ known addresses. On March 8, the well-known online community WallStreetBets introduced a WOLF token that quickly gained traction in the market. Bubblemaps identified the following key events: The developer of WOLF purchased the token before other investors using multiple wallets. The token's market value skyrocketed to $40 million before an alleged rugpull scam. 82% of WOLF’s supply was controlled in a packaged structure, raising red flags regarding its legitimacy. The WOLF founder, identified by the address 6MsuHd, was connected via 17 intermediary addresses and 5 cross-chain transfers. All transfers were ultimately routed to a single address named OxcEAe, which was previously attributed to Hayden Davis. Related News: Bitcoin Prophecies from BitMEX Founder Arthur Hayes: ""The FED Will Print More Money Than Anyone Has Ever Printed,"" Predicts BTC Price The transactions suggest that Davis was moving funds around months before the LIBRA and WOLF launches, likely in an attempt to conceal his involvement.

The total token supply is capped at 100 billion. Out of this, 20% of the tokens (20 billion) were made available for sale in October at a price of just $0.015. The initial sale experienced slow demand. However, after the launch of $TRUMP and $MELANIA, the Trump family’s in-house meme coins, the $WLFI token sale also took off. The first round raised around $300M. Another 5 billion tokens were then opened for sale at $0.05 per token, raising $250M. In addition to this $550M, Tron founder Justin Sun has invested $30M in the project, while Web3Port invested $10M. This investment made Justin an advisor of the project. Zak Folkman, the co-founder of WLFI, has said that the project intends to put 63% of the total supply for sale. Right now, only 25% of the tokens have been sold. This suggests that more rounds of token sales are coming at a possibly higher price. The Growing Stablecoin Supply You might be wondering why the WLFI token sale is crucial to the crypto markets. Well, there are a couple of reasons. Firstly, the fund is backed by Trump himself, who has gone all pro-crypto since his appointment as the president. A more technical second reason is that World Liberty Financial is a big promoter of US-backed stablecoins and DeFi applications. It wants to strengthen the US dollar. This is also evident with WLF’s current portfolio. Out of a total investment of $98M, $19.83M is held in stablecoins ($13.58 in USDT and $6.25M in USDC). That’s around 20% of the total portfolio value. The total market stablecoin supply is now around $219B, which suggests that the current cycle has still not exhausted its potential and that we’ve only reached midway. If you look at past data, the supply during April 2022 was $187B before the markets went bearish. We’re already past that, and the supply is still increasing. This increase is also propelled by declining crypto conditions, where institutional investors are adding crypto assets to their portfolio at throw-away prices. These attractive prices have meant that the supply isn’t declining. $ETH has seen more than a 50% decline in the last 3 months. In fact, WLFI holds $41M worth of ETH (40% of its portfolio). Everyone’s ravenous for a piece of the crypto pie, and this is bound to translate to higher price points for the best altcoins and a potential rally. If you’re looking to maximize your gains, consider investing in the best crypto presales , which are high-potential tokens at their cheapest ever rates. 1. BTC Bull Token ($BTCBULL) – Best Presale to Rally Behind Bitcoin’s Success Story The POTUS himself being a participant in the crypto hype is undoubtedly one of the biggest positives for the industry. And given that Bitcoin is at the helm of the crypto market – other coins follow the larger $BTC trend, after all – a new and innovative Bitcoin-based meme coin like BTC Bull Token ($BTCBULL) is possibly the best crypto to invest in right now. $BTCBULL separates itself from other tokens by being the only project that gives out free Bitcoins to its token holders. Yep, you read that right. You will receive an airdrop of $BTC as a token of appreciation for your loyalty if you purchase and hold $BTCBULL in Best Wallet . Another masterstroke by the BTC Bull Token team is that they’ve tied the Bitcoin airdrops to $BTC’s price. There will be $BTCBULL airdrops every time Bitcoin surges past a new milestone, like $150K, $200K, and $250K. Combined with regular token burns (after every $25K jump in Bitcoin’s price, to be precise), BTC Bull Token has ensured the price of its token continues to rise. As anticipation for an airdrop rises, so will $BTCBULL’s price. Luckily for you, $BTCBULL is currently in presale, meaning it’s the cheapest it could ever be. Just $0.002415 at the time of writing. Here’s how you can buy BTC Bull Token and join the $3.6M+ club. 2. Best Wallet Token ($BEST) – Top New Presale Belonging to the Best Crypto Wallet Quite naturally, the increased investor attraction towards crypto means folks are hungry for privacy-conscious crypto wallets that can store their prized possessions with utmost security. This is where the Best Wallet Token ($BEST) becomes a crypto worth buying . It is, after all, the native token of the highly secure and user-friendly crypto wallet, Best Wallet . Best Wallet is a non-custodial and multi-chain crypto wallet that leverages Fireblock’s MPC-CMP wallet technology, along with state-of-the-art 2FA/MFA, to ensure none other than you can access your funds. Buying $BEST tokens not only gives you a piece of the Best Wallet’s success, but it also comes with a handful of unique benefits, such as: No gas fees on Best Wallet Handsome airdrop and staking rewards Early-bird access to the best meme coins Regular market updates and access to real-time charts The $BEST presale has already raised over $11M and still shows no signs of slowing down. Each token is currently available for just $0.02435. Here’s how to buy $BEST . 3. Lightchain AI ($LCAI) – Aims to Build Secure Blockchains Lightchain AI ($LCAI) is proof that the crypto-AI relationship can bear sweet fruits. It’s a project that combines blockchain (Proof of Intelligence) and AI (Artificial Intelligence Virtual Machine) technologies to build new blockchains that are the epitome of security. Lightchain AI will work by rewarding users who make meaningful contributions to AI development. However, the contributions must me made in a way that they don’t hamper the network’s security. The token is in Stage 15 of its presale, which has so far amassed nearly $18M. 1 $LCAI is currently selling for only $0.007125. However, interested investors shouldn’t delay their purchase because there will be a price increase as the token enters the next presale stage. Final Verdict – DYOR Trump is undoubtedly pro-crypto, as evident by his own participation and push for crypto-friendly regulations in the US. However, some of the decisions he takes for the larger US economy – the tariffs, for instance – stand to have a major impact on crypto’s health. So, while the long-term outlook for crypto screams bullishness, the journey to the top could be one filled with choppiness and heavy volatility. That’s why it’s important to be smart about your crypto investments and only pour in an amount you’re comfortable sidelining. Lastly, you must always do your own research before investing – or perhaps even consult a professional for advice. None of the above is meant to be financial advice, by the way, as we merely put out our honest insights.",Cryptocurrency Market News,EN,0,0,TRADING|TOKEN SALE|BTC|MARKET|AIRDROP,"{'name': 'NewsBTC', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/newsbtc.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",newsbtc,2025-03-16 14:06:38

With the rapid growth of blockchain technology and decentralized finance (DeFi), many projects have emerged that promise quick gains for early participants. But when it comes to the best cryptos to join for short term profits this month, there are a few projects that are standing out from the rest. Qubetics, Cosmos, and Cardano have all made significant strides in their respective niches, offering unique features that appeal to community members looking to capitalize on short-term opportunities. Qubetics is quickly gaining traction with its successful presale, while Cosmos and Cardano continue to build strong ecosystems in the blockchain space. Let’s dive into what makes each of these projects a top contender for the best cryptos to join for short term profits this month. Qubetics: A Top Crypto to Join for Short Term Profits Qubetics is generating significant buzz right now, especially with its ongoing presale that’s raising millions and attracting thousands of backers. The presale has already sold over 499 million $TICS tokens to more than 23,000 community members, raising over $15 million. As the project continues to gain momentum, it’s becoming one of the best cryptos to join for short term profits. One of Qubetics’ standout features is its QubeQode Integrated Development Environment (IDE). This platform allows developers to create decentralized applications (dApps) on the Qubetics blockchain with ease. Imagine a business that needs to create a custom solution for its supply chain management. With QubeQode IDE, that business can quickly develop a decentralized app to track and manage its products in a secure, transparent way. This capability is game-changing for companies that want to adopt blockchain technology but don’t have the time or resources to build complex systems from scratch. QubeQode IDE also makes it easier for individual developers to create blockchain solutions, allowing anyone from independent contractors to large-scale enterprises to participate in the ecosystem. Whether you’re a freelancer working on a crypto-related project or a tech startup aiming to disrupt an industry, QubeQode provides the tools you need to bring your vision to life. The result is an expanding ecosystem that’s attracting more participants every day, which drives demand for $TICS tokens and helps elevate the project’s value. The crypto presale in the current stage offers a great entry point for early buyers. With $TICS tokens priced at $0.1074, there’s a significant upside if the price increases, as analysts predict. For example, if you invest $1,000 at the current presale price, you would receive around 9,300 $TICS tokens. When $TICS reaches $1 after the presale, your $1,000 investment would turn into $9,300. This potential for high returns in a short amount of time makes Qubetics one of the best cryptos to join for short term profits this month. Cosmos: Revolutionizing Blockchain Interoperability Cosmos has firmly established itself as one of the leading projects in the blockchain space by focusing on interoperability. The Cosmos network enables different blockchains to communicate and share data with each other, creating an ecosystem where various blockchain projects can operate seamlessly. This focus on interoperability is crucial for the future of decentralized finance (DeFi) and blockchain adoption as a whole. What makes Cosmos stand out is its ability to connect multiple blockchains, allowing them to work together in a decentralized and scalable manner. For instance, a company that operates on Ethereum might want to integrate with a supply chain management system built on Cosmos. Thanks to Cosmos’ Inter-Blockchain Communication (IBC) protocol, this is possible without the need for a centralized intermediary. This kind of cross-chain communication is a big deal for businesses, as it opens up new possibilities for collaboration and data sharing across different blockchain ecosystems. Cosmos has also made strides in scalability with its Tendermint consensus algorithm, which ensures faster transaction processing times without sacrificing security. For developers, this means they can build applications that scale effectively without the bottlenecks often seen on congested blockchains like Ethereum. This scalability makes Cosmos an attractive solution for projects looking to expand quickly, giving it a solid market position among top blockchain platforms. As one of the best cryptos to join for short term profits, Cosmos is worth considering for those looking to capitalize on its growing ecosystem. As more projects integrate with Cosmos, the demand for its native token, ATOM, is likely to increase, driving value for community members who get involved early. Cardano: A Blockchain Platform Focused on Sustainability and Innovation Cardano is one of the most well-known blockchain platforms, widely regarded for its scientific approach to blockchain development. Unlike many other blockchain projects, Cardano prioritizes sustainability, security, and scalability through rigorous academic research and peer-reviewed development. As a result, Cardano has attracted a dedicated following of backers who believe in its long-term potential. One of Cardano’s key features is its focus on smart contracts and decentralized applications. With the launch of the Alonzo upgrade, Cardano introduced smart contract functionality, enabling developers to build decentralized applications (dApps) on the platform. The project’s ecosystem is steadily growing, with Cardano’s unique approach to governance and sustainability appealing to a diverse range of participants. What sets Cardano apart is its commitment to creating a more inclusive financial system. Through partnerships and collaborations with governments and institutions, Cardano is working to bring blockchain technology to the masses, particularly in developing countries. By focusing on real-world use cases, Cardano is positioning itself as a go-to platform for those looking to adopt blockchain technology for social good. As one of the best cryptos to join for short term profits, Cardano’s strong market position and innovative approach to blockchain technology make it a solid choice for participants. With its growing ecosystem and focus on long-term sustainability, Cardano has the potential for both short-term and long-term success. Conclusion Qubetics, Cosmos, and Cardano all stand out as top contenders for the best cryptos to join for short term profits this month. Whether you’re drawn to Qubetics’ presale momentum and its innovative QubeQode IDE, Cosmos’ game-changing interoperability, or Cardano’s sustainable and scalable blockchain ecosystem, each of these projects offers unique opportunities for growth. For those looking to get involved in the fast-moving world of blockchain, these three projects are worth considering as part of a diversified portfolio. Qubetics, in particular, stands out for its explosive presale growth and high ROI potential. With analysts predicting major returns for early adopters, the opportunity to get involved at this stage is one that shouldn’t be missed.

Ranked #34 in the crypto market, Mantle boasts a market capitalization of $2.69 billion, with 3.36 billion MNT in circulation. MNT has been riding a strong uptrend within an ascending channel, holding support at $0.7892, while the 50-period EMA at $0.7415 reinforces the bullish structure. If momentum holds, MNT could challenge its next key resistance at $0.8368, followed by $0.8857 and $0.9371. What Makes Mantle (MNT) a Game-Changer? Mantle is building the future of on-chain finance with a focus on scalability, low fees, and deep liquidity. The project is backed by Mantle Treasury, a $4.3 billion community-owned fund, ensuring financial stability and ecosystem growth. Core Features of Mantle: Modular Layer-2 Scaling: Enables faster transactions with lower fees while maintaining Ethereum’s security. Key Protocols: Mantle Network, mETH Protocol, and FBTC drive adoption and innovation. Strategic Partnerships: Collaborations with Agora AUSD, Ethena USDe, and Ondo USDY expand Mantle’s DeFi reach. Governance by MNT Holders: Mantle operates as a DAO, where key decisions are community-driven. With Mantle Grants Program and a $200M EcoFund, the network is attracting developers and investors seeking long-term, sustainable growth. Technical Outlook: Can MNT Sustain Its Uptrend? MNT is riding an upward channel, with support at $0.7892 reinforcing the bullish structure. The 50-period EMA at $0.7415 is also providing dynamic support, strengthening the case for continued gains. Immediate resistance stands at $0.8368, with the next upside targets at $0.8857 and $0.9371, should momentum persist. A break above $0.8368 could accelerate bullish momentum, pushing MNT toward multi-week highs. However, a failure to hold the $0.7892 support level may trigger a correction toward $0.7545 and $0.7031, which align with previous demand zones. Conclusion: Is MNT Ready for Another Leg Up? MNT’s bullish structure remains intact, but traders should watch for a decisive break above $0.8368 for confirmation of further upside. With a strong backing from the Mantle Treasury and increasing adoption, MNT’s long-term outlook remains promising. However, if sellers gain control, a retest of support at $0.7892 could provide a new buying opportunity. As Mantle continues its bullish trajectory, another project gaining momentum in the crypto space is BTC Bull—a presale token offering real Bitcoin rewards. BTC Bull: Earn Bitcoin Rewards with the Hottest Crypto Presale BTC Bull ($BTCBULL) is making waves as a community-driven token that automatically rewards holders with real Bitcoin when BTC hits key price milestones. Unlike traditional meme tokens, BTCBULL is built for long-term investors, offering real incentives through airdropped BTC rewards and staking opportunities. Staking & Passive Income Opportunities BTC Bull offers a high-yield staking program with an impressive 119% APY, allowing users to generate passive income. The staking pool has already attracted 882.5 million BTCBULL tokens, highlighting strong community participation. Latest Presale Updates: Current Presale Price: $0.002415per BTCBULL Total Raised: $3.6M / $4.1M target With demand surging, this presale provides an opportunity to acquire BTCBULL at early-stage pricing before the next price increase.

Prosecutors accuse Segal of swindling Wyoming businesses out of more than $212,000. The 30-year-old California resident faces up to 141 years in prison if convicted. According to a report by The Daily Mail , Segal posed as a wealthy businessman attempting to purchase millions in real estate in the Jackson Hole area while leaving a trail of unpaid bills at luxury resorts and businesses. Judge Bill Simpson issued a bench warrant across all 50 states after Segal skipped his Wednesday court appearance and allegedly failed to surrender his passport as ordered.

Irvine claims Segal had promised him “a large Bitcoin payout that equated to half a million dollars” in exchange for posting the bond but disappeared after being released from jail on Feb. 14. “He explained the situation and was basically denying all the charges written in the newspaper,” Irvine said. “[He] said it was libel and slander; and he didn’t intend to defraud anybody. He was locked up in jail, and [said] that’s why he couldn’t pay anybody off.” After feeling betrayed, Irvine sent Segal a text message: “You screwed me over, and now I really don’t believe anything you say anymore. Irvine is now considering bankruptcy due to the financial damage. Investigators discovered a pattern of fraudulent activities throughout Wyoming. Segal reportedly stayed at the luxurious Amangani resort with his mother and a friend, allegedly leaving a $2,725.76 bill unpaid. At Spring Creek Ranch, three cards he used for bills totaling over $22,000 were reported to be fraudulent. It was also reported that he left the Mangy Moose Saloon with an unpaid $3,055.28 tab. The alleged scams extended to individuals as well. Prosecutors say Segal hired a man to purchase a DJI drone in Colorado with a promise of reimbursement, then wrote a check for $3,281.46 that failed to clear. In another instance, he sent a delivery man to drive a Dodge back to Los Angeles, promising to pay for return flights that were allegedly never purchased. The men were stranded and forced to buy their own tickets home, with Segal later sending a fake wire transfer screenshot to cover their $3,101 in expenses. This isn’t Segal’s first legal trouble. Court documents obtained by the Daily Mail show he previously faced a civil lawsuit claiming he falsely claimed to have stocks exceeding $340 million and a successful company to lease a Los Angeles property. If caught, Segal will face a substantially increased bond of $750,000 cash-only.

In a new interview on CNBC Television, Eric Johnston, a macro strategist at Cantor Fitzgerald, says that he expects a short-term bounce in the stock market during the next couple of weeks even though he says the equity environment looks “fairly poor.” “You have an economy that is clearly slowing. Uncertainty is quite high… But within that view, we think we’re going to get a tactical rally here, probably somewhere in the range of 3% to 5% in the next couple of weeks. We think things line up very well from a technical perspective.” Johnston uses many technical indicators, such as the Relative Strength Index (RSI) – a momentum indicator used to indicate overbought or oversold levels – to support his stance that a tactical rally is in sight. “The RSI has gone below 32. We’ve backtested that [and it] backtests very consistent, very strong. The VIX curve (volatility index) has gone inverted. That is showing fear. That is also backtested very well. Seasonality is turning. Systematic funds have likely already sold what they needed to sell. And hedge funds have also brought down their net exposure. So you add that to the Fed next week, which is where we think they’re going to be dovish. And we think this sets up for a nice rally over the course of the next one to two weeks into month-end.” Recently, it was reported that the US stock market lost a staggering $5 trillion in value during the last three weeks.

This possibility comes as XRP consolidates just above the crucial $2 spot, with the $2.5 zone as the next immediate resistance to watch. According to prominent cryptocurrency analyst Ali Martinez, XRP could potentially hit a $15 valuation because the digital asset has broken out of a symmetrical triangle pattern on the monthly chart, as noted in an X post on March 16. XRP price analysis chart. Source: TradingView/Ali_charts This symmetrical triangle pattern, which has formed since 2018, has historically preceded major price surges. As price action tightened, XRP recently broke above the upper trendline, signaling a potential uptrend. If the breakout holds, XRP could enter a price discovery phase, with a projected target of $15, potentially pushing its market cap to $870 billion. However, key resistance levels remain, and any pullbacks toward the breakout zone could test investor confidence. XRP’s key support to watch Meanwhile, an analysis by Egrag Crypto on March 16 stressed that for XRP to push toward $3, the $2.2 support needs to hold firm. As per the analysis, XRP is trading within an ascending channel, with $3 as the next key area of focus. XRP price analysis chart. Source: TradingView/Egrag Crypto If $3 is breached, the next major target aligns with the upper trendline, estimated at around $4.80 to $5. The broader formation suggests XRP is in an extended accumulation phase, with a breakout potentially leading to a 510% upside, targeting $14.84 as a long-term projection. However, a failure to hold $2.22 could see XRP retesting lower support near $2.17 before resuming its uptrend. As reported by Finbold, on-chain metrics support the possibility of an XRP rally, given that the asset has recorded an all-time high in the number of addresses near the seven million mark. However, the asset could be volatile, given that Ripple is set to release significant XRP from its escrow holdings . It is worth noting that the XRP community aims for sustained price growth after the asset broke out of a prolonged consolidation below the $1 spot. One catalyst for this growth could stem from reports suggesting that the case between Ripple and the Securities and Exchange Commission ( SEC ) might be moving toward a resolution. Indeed, the case has long been cited as a factor suppressing XRP’s growth. On the other hand, XRP may see strong capital inflows as several spot ETFs await SEC approval, with analysts estimating a 65% approval chance by October.

This price spike was triggered by the news of a French court approving the departure of Telegram founder Pavel Durov from France. Telegram Founder Reportedly Cleared To Leave France According to a report on Saturday, Durov was granted permission by a French court to depart the country, where he faces several charges of enabling organized crime. One of AFP’s sources said that the Telegram founder had been authorized to leave France for “several weeks.” Durov’s legal troubles began on August 24, 2024, after he was detained at the Le Bourget airport in Paris. A few days later, France’s Prosecutor’s Office brought several charges against the Telegram founder centered around running a messaging platform that allegedly enabled illegal activities. Related Reading: Stablecoins Supply Up By $20 Billion – The Key To Bitcoin’s Next Move? On August 28, Durov was released on a $6 million bail, albeit with restrictions on his movement and travels. The French prosecutors demanded that the Telegram founder remain in the country until the conclusion of their investigation. While the current condition of Durov’s case remains unclear, a source close to the case stated the Telegram founder was allowed to leave France temporarily after the investigating judge approved his request to modify the conditions of his supervision. “A third source said Durov had departed for Dubai,” AFP reported. Durov’s arrest led to an uproar within the crypto community at the time, as experts assessed the implications of such a move on the future of technology and encryption. Moreover, it marked another incident in the worrying trend of holding founders and developers accountable for the use of their platforms. It is worth mentioning that, as of press time, there has been no official word from Telegram and Durov confirming the report. TON Price Up 20% Following the report of Durov’s departure from France, TON (native cryptocurrency of The Open Network) reacted with a more than 20% price spike. As with the general crypto market, the altcoin has struggled to build any momentum in the past few months. After reaching the local high of $6 in early December, the TON price has since been on a steady decline. On Tuesday, March 11, the cryptocurrency dropped beneath the $2.5 mark for the first time in over a year. As of this writing, the TON price stands at around $3.4, reflecting an almost 18% surge in the past 24 hours. According to CoinGecko, the token’s performance has improved to a positive 17% gain in the past seven days.

Bold 2025 ATH Price Predictions for XRP & ADA,https://bitzo.com/2025/03/will-xrp-reach-7-and-cardano-hit-5-bold-2025-ath-price-predictions-for-xrp-ada,"Some believe XRP and Cardano could see unprecedented price surges by 2025. Predictions hint at new all-time highs, with XRP potentially reaching $7 and Cardano hitting $5. Such forecasts spark curiosity and debate among investors and crypto enthusiasts. Explore the factors driving these bold predictions and which coins are poised for significant growth. XRP Surge Amid Short-Term Fluctuations XRP experienced a modest decline of about 6.77% in the past month while achieving a remarkable surge of roughly 307.17% over the past six months. Recent price movements reveal a mix of volatile short-term dips counterpoised by strong long-term growth. The significant half-year gain highlights a powerful upward momentum that has been limited in the short term. Current trading shows XRP priced between $1.60 and $2.88. Key levels include support at $1.06 and resistance at $3.61, with a secondary resistance at $4.89. Price behavior suggests a balance between buyers and sellers with no clear trend emerging, indicating potential opportunities for trades within these key zones. Cardano Experiences Fluctuations as Market Conditions Shift Cardano experienced an 8.49% drop over the last month while surging 124.77% over the past six months, indicating a mix of short-term weakness and long-term strength. A recent one-week decline of 7.58% adds to the short-term volatility, reflecting rapid price adjustments during fluctuating market sentiment. These moves highlight a dynamic price evolution as Cardano adjusts to shifts in investor behavior and broader market conditions. ADA currently trades between $0.44 and $0.88, with support at $0.26 and resistance near $1.15. The additional resistance at $1.59 presents an upper hurdle, while the lack of a clear trend and an RSI at 47.65 keep bulls and bears in cautious balance. Trading within these levels may present opportunities for buying near support and selling near resistance. Conclusion XRP and ADA have shown strong potential for growth. Market dynamics and evolving use cases will play pivotal roles. XRP's drive toward $7 hinges on regulatory outcomes and increased institutional adoption. ADA's path to $5 depends on continuous development and successful network upgrades. Both coins are positioned well, but achieving these price points will require favorable market conditions and investor confidence. Steady progress and clear roadmaps will be key factors.

The surge has propelled A8 to rank #428 in the crypto market, with a market cap of $65.32 million and 266.07 million A8 tokens in circulation. However, the rally has met resistance at $0.4240, triggering a profit-taking correction that has brought A8 down to $0.2388. The price is now hovering around the 50% Fibonacci retracement at $0.2618, indicating a critical support zone. Ancient8: The Future of Blockchain Gaming?

The token has climbed to rank #428, boasting a market capitalization of $65.32 million, with 266.07 million A8 coins in circulation. However, profit-taking has triggered a bearish correction, with A8 retreating from its $0.4240 high. The token has now completed a 50% Fibonacci retracement, stabilizing near $0.2618, though further downside remains possible. Technical Analysis & Market Sentiment A8 remains above the 50-period EMA at $0.1516, suggesting underlying bullish strength, but momentum has slowed. The bearish correction is deepening, and if the token fails to hold $0.2233, it could slide further toward $0.1848 or even $0.1514. If bulls can push past $0.3002, A8 could test $0.3478 in the short term, with a potential breakout toward $0.3948. Conversely, if $0.2233 support fails, expect a retest of $0.1848-$0.1514, where stronger demand could emerge. Traders should monitor trading volume and RSI levels to gauge momentum shifts. Conclusion: Will A8 Hold or Drop Further? A8’s recent pullback is part of a natural price cycle after its rapid surge. If support holds at $0.2233, a rebound toward $0.3002 remains possible. Investors should watch for volume confirmation and Bitcoin’s broader market trend, which could influence A8’s next leg up.

According to authorities, the suspects were running a gambling ring worth about $3.8 billion, allowing users to bet with several digital assets, including USDT, ETH, and Naga tokens. Aside from providing a platform for users to bet, the group also allowed them to earn commissions by inviting new participants. The Vietnamese police have also said that they are expanding their investigations into the gambling ring led by 32-year-old Huynh Long Nhu, alongside his brothers Huynh Long Tu and Huynh Long Bach. The authorities mentioned that at the request of the prosecutors in charge of the case, they are also investigating their sister Huynh Thi Ha Tay. According to the Vietnamese police, they have recommended a charge of organizing gambling and gambling for Nhu, Tu, Tay, and about nine other defendants. Vietnamese police want brothers to face gambling charges According to the Vietnamese police, Bach and 20 others should face only charges of organizing gambling, while 10 other members of the ring would be charged for gambling. Authorities mentioned that the brain behind the whole operation, Indian national 32-year-old Bhatia Mohit, is currently at large, with the police also in coordinated efforts to apprehend other members of the ring. Huynh Long Bach arrested in connection to the crime. Source: VNExpress. The police mentioned that the gambling ring ran a full-scale operation, with the network running from early 2020 before their operation was dismantled at the end of 2021. According to investigators, Nhu and Bach were in charge of a website that had 25,000 registered accounts, with about $3.8 billion in bets facilitated. Huynh Long Nhu arrested in connection to the crime. Source: VNExpress. Authorities mentioned that the siblings hired foreign IT experts to help develop and maintain the websites. The gambling ring used Swiftonline.live and Nagaclubs.com websites, which authorities said were linked to the international betting website Evolution.com. The group also rented online card game portals to support its gambling operations. Nhu was in charge of Swift online.live, while Bach controlled Naga clubs.com, which alone had more than 5,000 registered accounts. Authorities bust fake multi-level marketing investment scheme According to the police, the group lured players to their website by promoting it as a financial investment in cryptocurrencies, running a multi-level marketing model. The website, under this model, promised users daily profits of about 1% to 1.5%. The group urged users to register to insure their bets, which would guarantee them a reward if they lost. In addition, players were also rewarded with commissions if they recruited players into the investment scheme. To carry out activities on the platform, users were asked to create an account on Switfonline.live website and purchase USDT using Vietnamese currency from exchanges like Binance and Remitano or from other players. The digital assets were then moved to the platform’s wallet, where users could gamble. The minimum deposit on the platform was $20, which was often paid in USDT. The platform allowed users to withdraw their winnings only if they hit the $20 threshold. Users could withdraw through Remitano or Binance or sell their winnings to another platform member to be converted to cash. The modus operandi was the same for other platforms run by the group, with the USDT deposits made on Nagaclubs.com converted to Naga tokens before being used on the platform. Nagaclubs.com ran its special multi-level commission structure, ranking players on the platform from VIP 1 to VIP 10, basing these ranks on the number of recruits a user brings to the platform or how much they used to gamble. The system automatically distributes rewards according to the ranks of the users’ accounts. Members also created telegram groups to monitor gambling activities and schedule bets. Cars purchased with proceeds from the crime. Source: VNExpress. According to investigations, the gambling ring made a lot of profit from the venture, with reports claiming that Nhu and his accomplices saw gains of about $2.2 million from their website, while Bach and his accomplices also saw gains of about $2.5 million from their website. The illicit funds were used to purchase several luxury items, including cars, real estate, and land. The gang members also sent some of the funds abroad, raising concerns about money laundering. Authorities are pursuing legal actions against the members apprehended while still tracking down other fugitives. Cryptopolitan Academy: Tired of market swings?

Analysts point out Ethereum (ETH) parallels historic oversold conditions including the 2021 Terra collapse and 2016 DAO hack — periods that followed with explosive recoveries. Alliance DAO founder Qiao Wang notes Ethereum (ETH) present-day valuation now recalls panic-driven bottoms of yore, and considers that a potential entry point for institutions which have eyes toward eventual adoption on a multi-decade time frame. Ethereum (ETH) 3-year Stochastic RSI is now in oversold territory according to technical analyst Merlijn The Trader, a signal which has preceded 300% plus rallies. As Morgan Stanley sticks to a target of $15,000 for ETH by 2025, a challenger token—Mutuum Finance (MUTM)—is catching the eye with predictions it could soar 8,900% above its current $0.02 presale price. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Presale on Fire Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Further Engages Investors with $3.4M Raised and Over 5,700 Holders. During Phase 3 of Its Presale It is priced at $0.02 — Mutuum Finance (MUTM) will jump 25% to $0.025 when Phase 4 starts, which means all current participants bag immediate paper profits. Excitedly, it will be listing on exchanges at $0.06, a guarantee of a 200% return for Mutuum Finance (MUTM) presale purchasers. Further down the line, analysts estimate that Mutuum Finance (MUTM) could peak as high as $1.80 in the first few months, made possible by its unique lending protocols and deflationary tokenomics. That would turn a $500 investment into $9,000, eclipsing long-term projections for Ethereum. Tokenomics—Strategic for Fueling Trust Mutuum Finance’s ecosystem features mtTokens, interest-bearing assets representing user deposits, and a buy-and-distribute model that directs platform revenue toward purchasing MUTM tokens. These tokens are then redistributed back to stakers, establishing a continual incentive to buy while significantly reducing the sell pressure. The Mutuum Finance (MUTM) presale framework is designed to heighten urgency: the price step up for each phase reduces the latitudes of discounted entry, while Phase 3 allocations are starting to run low. There are also early access to $100,000 giveaway, encouraging earlier action before the next Mutuum Finance (MUTM) price increase. Improvements on a Security and Roadmap Level Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is undergoing a Certik audit of its smart contracts, when this goes final it will be showing up on exchanges. Results will be declared through official channels for increased transparency. The Mutuum Finance (MUTM) platform’s upcoming P2P lending feature and overcollateralized stablecoin further separate it from speculative peers, The core principles of DeFi, utility and stability – are perfectly reflected in the Mutuum Finance (MUTM) model of the platform. While Ethereum (ETH) recovery now relies on changes in macroeconomic conditions, including ETF approvals, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) promises quantifiable paths to exponential gains with sound tokenomics and increasing presale demand. Phase 3 is ongoing at $0.02, but time is running tight — once filled, we slide up to the next price tier. For investors focused on agility rather than legacy assets, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) 200%-presale-return and $1.80-price-prediction is therefore such an appealing opportunity. Join The Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Presale Before Phase 4 Begins Ethereum (ETH) following that $15,000 path might take time – Mutuum Finance’s is just around the corner. With Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Phase 3 approaching full and Certik verification in process, the project’s token infrastructure and investor momentum have it positioned for immediate revaluation.

41758671,https://cointelegraph.com/news/web3-has-a-metadata-problem,1742137200,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cointelegraph.png,"Web3 has a metadata problem, and it’s not going away",https://cointelegraph.com/news/web3-has-a-metadata-problem?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound,"Opinion by: Casey Ford, PhD, researcher at Nym Technologies Web3 rolled in on the wave of decentralization. Decentralized applications (DApps) grew by 74% in 2024 and individual wallets by 485%, with total value locked (TVL) in decentralized finance (DeFi) closing at a near-record high of $214 billion. The industry is also, however, heading straight for a state of capture if it does not wake up. As Elon Musk has teased of placing the US Treasury on blockchain, however poorly thought out, the tides are turning as crypto is deregulated . But when they do, is Web3 ready to “protect [user] data,” as Musk surrogates pledge? If not, we’re all on the brink of a global data security crisis. The crisis boils down to a vulnerability at the heart of the digital world: the metadata surveillance of all existing networks, even the decentralized ones of Web3 . AI technologies are now at the foundation of surveillance systems and serve as accelerants. Anonymity networks offer a way out of this state of capture. But this must begin with metadata protections across the board. Metadata is the new frontier of surveillance Metadata is the overlooked raw material of AI surveillance. Compared to payload data, metadata is lightweight and thus easy to process en masse. Here, AI systems excel best. Aggregated metadata can reveal much more than encrypted contents: patterns of behaviors, networks of contacts, personal desires and, ultimately, predictability. And legally, it is unprotected in the way end-to-end (E2E) encrypted communications are now in some regions. While metadata is a part of all digital assets, the metadata that leaks from E2E encrypted traffic exposes us and what we do: IPs, timing signatures, packet sizes, encryption formats and even wallet specifications. All of this is fully legible to adversaries surveilling a network. Blockchain transactions are no exception. From piles of digital junk can emerge a goldmine of detailed records of everything we do. Metadata is our digital unconscious, and it is up for grabs for whatever machines can harvest it for profit. The limits of blockchain Protecting the metadata of transactions was an afterthought of blockchain technology. Crypto does not offer anonymity despite the reactionary association of the industry with illicit trade. It offers pseudonymity , the ability to hold tokens in a wallet with a chosen name. Recent: How to tokenize real-world assets on Bitcoin Harry Halpin and Ania Piotrowska have diagnosed the situation: “[T]he public nature of Bitcoin’s ledger of transactions [...] means anyone can observe the flow of coins. [P]seudonymous addresses do not provide any meaningful level of anonymity, since anyone can harvest the counterparty addresses of any given transaction and reconstruct the chain of transactions.” As all chain transactions are public, anyone running a full node can have a panoptic view of chain activity. Further, metadata like IP addresses attached to pseudonymous wallets can be used to identify people’s locations and identities if tracking technologies are sophisticated enough. This is the core problem of metadata surveillance in blockchain economics: Surveillance systems can effectively de-anonymize our financial traffic by any capable party. Knowledge is also an insecurity Knowledge is not just power, as the adage goes. It’s also the basis on which we are exploited and disempowered. There are at least three general metadata risks across Web3. Fraud: Financial insecurity and surveillance are intrinsically linked. The most serious hacks, thefts or scams depend on accumulated knowledge about a target: their assets, transaction histories and who they are. DappRadar estimates a $1.3-billion loss due to “hacks and exploits” like phishing attacks in 2024 alone. Leaks: The wallets that permit access to decentralized tokenomics rely on leaky centralized infrastructures. Studies of DApps and wallets have shown the prevalence of IP leaks: “The existing wallet infrastructure is not in favor of users’ privacy. Websites abuse wallets to fingerprint users online, and DApps and wallets leak the user’s wallet address to third parties.” Pseudonymity is pointless if people’s identities and patterns of transactions can be easily revealed through metadata. Chain consensus: Chain consensus is a potential point of attack. One example is a recent initiative by Celestia to add an anonymity layer to obscure the metadata of validators against particular attacks seeking to disrupt chain consensus in Celestia’s Data Availability Sampling (DAS) process. Securing Web3 through anonymity As Web3 continues to grow, so does the amount of metadata about people’s activities being offered up to newly empowered surveillance systems. Beyond VPNs Virtual private network (VPN) technology is decades old at this point. The lack of advancement is shocking, with most VPNs remaining in the same centralized and proprietary infrastructures. Networks like Tor and Dandelion stepped in as decentralized solutions. Yet they are still vulnerable to surveillance by global adversaries capable of “timing analysis” via the control of entry and exit nodes. Even more advanced tools are needed. Noise networks All surveillance looks for patterns in a network full of noise. By further obscuring patterns of communication and de-linking metadata like IPs from metadata generated by traffic, the possible attack vectors can be significantly reduced, and metadata patterns can be scrambled into nonsense. Anonymizing networks have emerged to anonymize sensitive traffic like communications or crypto transactions via noise: cover traffic, timing obfuscations and data mixing. In the same spirit, other VPNs like Mullvad have introduced programs like DAITA (Defense Against AI-guided Traffic Analysis), which seeks to add “distortion” to its VPN network. Scrambling the codes Whether it’s defending people against the assassinations in tomorrow’s drone wars or securing their onchain transactions, new anonymity networks are needed to scramble the codes of what makes all of us targetable: the metadata our online lives leave in their wake. The state of capture is already here. Machine learning is feeding off our data. Instead of leaving people’s data there unprotected, Web3 and anonymity systems can make sure that what ends up in the teeth of AI is effectively garbage.

33767162,[object Object],1742137242,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/33767162.jpeg,Telegram’s Pavel Durov Allowed To Temporarily Leave France Amid Lawsuit – Details,https://bitcoinist.com/telegrams-pavel-durov-grant-temporary-leave-france/,"Pavel Durov, founder and CEO of social media app Telegram, has been allowed to leave France amid an ongoing court case with French authorities. The Russian-born billionaire has reportedly traveled to Dubai leaving the French territory for the first time since his indictment last year. Telegram Founder Tastes Freedom – Case Resolved? In August 2024, French law enforcement officers arrested Pavel Durov at Le Bourget Airport near Paris, citing a lack of control measures on Telegram. Within four days, the renowned tech entrepreneur was formally charged with failing to curb illegal activities on Telegram, including terrorism-related content and child pornography materials, despite the platform’s vast user base of over 900 million. Durov’s arrest sparked a widespread debate among internet users, raising concerns over free speech and the extent to which social media platform owners should be held accountable for user activities. Shortly after his detention, the Telegram CEO was released on a €5 million ($5.6 million) bail but was prohibited from leaving France.According to a recent report by AFP, a French court has now approved a temporary leave for Durov allowing the defendant to travel to Dubai on March 15. It remains unknown if the Telegram founder has resolved the charges by the Paris’s Prosecutor office but an unnamed source says Durov is allowed to spend some weeks outside of France. TON Foundation Lauds Pavel’s Freedom The “temporary” release of the highly revered tech figure has been well-received by the digital community including many crypto enthusiasts. Notably, the Telegram messaging app has ventured boldly into the blockchain space over the past few years. In 2018, Telegram developed The Open Network (TON) blockchain, which it intended to use in launching its own cryptocurrency Gram.Following regulatory issues with the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), Telegram’s leadership transferred ownership of TON to an independent community of developers. However, the social media app remains integrated with TON and allows the use of Toncoin for payments as well as hosts several web3 applications. Commenting on Pavel’s release, the TON Foundation released a statement saying: This news marks a significant moment of resolution. With nearly a billion users worldwide, Telegram represents a global movement committed to the freedom of communication and the inalienable right to privacy. As part of the decentralized TON community, we have stood in solidarity with Pavel, supporting his unwavering dedication to defending the right to free speech and privacy online. They further added: We extend our deepest gratitude to our community, the broader tech industry, and all advocates of free speech who have been vocal in their support of Pavel. Following news of Durov’s departure from France, Toncoin (TON) surged by 20%, and reached a peak of $3.47 before trading at around $3.46.

The attackers gained control of the account and falsely claimed that Kaito AI’s wallets had been compromised, warning users that their funds were at risk. According to blockchain investigator Defi Warhol, the attackers also reportedly opened a short position on Kaito tokens before posting the false alerts. Their goal appeared to be manipulating the token’s price downward so they could profit from the artificial decline. However, Kaito AI’s team quickly regained control of the compromised account and reassured users that their wallets remained secure. The team also said that they had implemented robust security measures to prevent such incidents in the future, noting that the attack seemed similar to other recent breaches targeting crypto-related accounts. The company wrote, “This account and @Punk9277 were just compromised. The KAITO wallets were NOT and are NOT compromised. We now have regained access to the twitter accounts. Please bare with us as we investigate how this happened. We had high standard security measures in place to prevent it – so it seems to be similar or the same to other recent Twitter account hacks. We’ll update as soon as we can. To reiterate – KAITO token wallets have not been compromised.” The rise in such cyberattacks has led to an alarming increase in losses within the crypto ecosystem. According to a report by blockchain security platform Immunefi, losses in February 2025 were 20 times higher than in January 2025, with a sharp increase in scams targeting investors.",News|Crypto news,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|BUSINESS|MARKET|TRADING,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-03-16 15:06:30

As of March 16, 2025, BTC is trading at $83,147, reflecting a 1.55% decrease from its previous close. While short-term price action remains uncertain, key support and resistance levels are shaping Bitcoin’s next move. February 2025: Market Correction and Declining Demand February was a challenging month for Bitcoin (BTC), as macroeconomic factors and investor sentiment led to a substantial 12% drop in its value. The cryptocurrency struggled to hold its position above the $100,000 mark, and selling pressure intensified due to external factors, including global economic concerns and shifting market dynamics. BTC Price Action One of the key developments in February was the decline in Bitcoin’s apparent demand, which reached its lowest level of 2025. This decline coincided with a broader cryptocurrency market downturn, as traders and institutions reevaluated their risk exposure. Despite the pullback, historical trends indicate that Bitcoin has often rebounded strongly after periods of correction. March 2025: Signs of Recovery and Reduced Volatility In March, Bitcoin (BTC) has shown early signs of stabilization. The cryptocurrency has traded between $84,506 (high) and $82,421 (low), maintaining a tighter range than in previous months. Additionally, Bitcoin’s (BTC) one-year realized volatility is now in its lowest fifth percentile since 2010, indicating reduced price fluctuations and a potential phase of market consolidation. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Although BTC is currently down 1.55% for the day, it has gained around 5% from its early March lows, suggesting a possible shift in sentiment. If this trend continues, Bitcoin (BTC) could establish a stronger support base, paving the way for future bullish momentum. Market Projections and Key Levels to Watch Despite short-term setbacks, market analysts remain optimistic about Bitcoin’s (BTC) long-term trajectory. Some forecasts predict BTC could reach $150,000 in the first half of 2025, with a potential push toward $185,000 by the end of the year, driven by growing institutional interest and improving regulatory conditions. For now, Bitcoin’s (BTC) key support level sits at $80,000, while $85,000 serves as an immediate resistance level. A break above resistance could signal renewed buying momentum, whereas a drop below support may lead to further declines. Navigating Bitcoin’s Next Move As Bitcoin (BTC) moves through this critical phase, traders and investors should closely monitor market signals and macroeconomic developments. While February’s decline tested investor confidence, March’s price stability suggests a possible shift in momentum. Whether BTC can regain its bullish trend will depend on broader market conditions and its ability to maintain key price levels.

Here’s What It Means,https://timestabloid.com/amina-bank-introduces-cardano-ada-staking-heres-what-it-means/,"AMINA Bank has officially launched Cardano (ADA) staking services for its customers, signaling a significant milestone in the broader adoption of ADA within institutional finance. This move not only enhances the accessibility of staking for retail and institutional investors but also reinforces Cardano’s growing influence in the blockchain ecosystem. With AMINA Bank’s backing, ADA staking is now more accessible, secure, and integrated into traditional financial services. Institutional Embrace of Cardano Staking Staking has been a fundamental feature of Cardano’s blockchain, allowing holders to participate in network security and consensus while earning passive rewards. Until recently, staking was primarily conducted through decentralized wallets and platforms within the crypto space. AMINA Bank’s entry into ADA staking bridges traditional banking and decentralized finance, allowing mainstream investors to engage with Cardano without navigating complex DeFi protocols. AMINA Bank legitimizes ADA as an asset class within the institutional landscape by offering staking services. Customers can now stake ADA directly through a regulated banking institution, reducing risks associated with self-custody and smart contract interactions. This development is expected to attract more conservative investors who prefer the security of a banking partner over independent staking solutions. JUST IN: AMINA Bank is now offering Cardano $ADA staking services to its customers, bringing more institutional adoption to the ecosystem. pic.twitter.com/Qqod9Oe71j — TapTools (@TapTools) March 15, 2025 The Impact on Cardano’s Ecosystem AMINA Bank’s decision to support ADA staking is a testament to Cardano’s increasing recognition in the financial sector. As more institutions integrate ADA into their offerings, the network’s staking participation rate is likely to rise, strengthening its security and decentralization. Higher staking engagement also translates to reduced circulating supply, as more ADA is locked up for rewards rather than being actively traded. This could contribute to a more stable price environment and potentially drive long-term appreciation as demand continues to grow. Moreover, the integration of ADA staking into a regulated banking system reinforces confidence in the broader cryptocurrency industry. It demonstrates that blockchain-based financial services can coexist with traditional banking, paving the way for future collaborations and further adoption of decentralized technologies. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Institutional Interest in Cardano Grows Cardano’s unique proof-of-stake (PoS) mechanism and emphasis on sustainability make it an attractive option for institutions exploring blockchain-based investments. Unlike energy-intensive proof-of-work (PoW) networks, Cardano’s staking model offers efficiency, scalability, and environmental friendliness, aligning with the growing demand for sustainable financial products. AMINA Bank’s adoption of ADA staking may encourage other financial institutions to explore similar offerings, accelerating institutional interest in Cardano’s ecosystem. If more banks and investment firms integrate ADA staking into their services, it could solidify Cardano’s position as a leading blockchain platform for institutional-grade staking solutions. A Defining Moment for Cardano and Institutional Crypto Adoption AMINA Bank’s move to offer Cardano (ADA) staking services represents a pivotal moment for both the Cardano ecosystem and the broader institutional adoption of cryptocurrency. By bridging the gap between traditional finance and blockchain technology, this development highlights ADA’s growing credibility as a stakable asset. As institutional involvement in crypto continues to expand, Cardano stands to benefit from increased staking participation, enhanced security, and greater market stability. AMINA Bank’s initiative sets a precedent for other financial institutions to follow, further integrating ADA into mainstream finance and reinforcing its long-term value proposition.

Crypto whales look to profit from the stretched market dip ahead of an expected rebound. Ethereum holds its $1,893 position, an attractive point for whales after several retail sales. ETH Whales Accumulate Huge Assets In the last seven days, crypto whales bought over 400,000 ETH and moved about 600,000 off centralized exchanges. This comes after a week of sideways trading and low buying momentum. Movement off exchanges remains a strong bullish signal highlighting long-term hodling. These transfers are often linked to a purchase, just as inflows to exchanges point to a potential sale. Digital asset enthusiasts say reduced exchange reserves can spark a price turnaround. With the price range at the 2024 support mark, whale inflows could set the pace. In January, crypto bulls projected a $4k price for Ethereum citing the altcoin season and a surging crypto market. Recent weeks have seen the reverse marked with huge sales from several quarters. With plunging crypto prices, asset repositioning is taking shape. The altcoin season will record improved prices as BTC dominance declines, which is why investors are backing ETH. During the bull peak, these buyers look to a near $2,500 and a higher $4k price. This means an almost 100% asset price from present levels. Such a jump requires a higher institutional appetite than 2024 levels. In Q4 2024, ETH institutional volume jumped 14.5% amid low retail numbers. Digital asset investor Ted Pillows backed the asset as the best layer for banks and other commercial institutions. “ Ethereum is the best layer for institutions like commercial banks, central banks, credit unions, insurers, and government-linked entities. Global adoption is on the rise, and the USA’s pro-crypto stance is a big catalyst. With plans to bring the US Treasury on-chain, $ETH is positioned for a strong comeback and widespread use.” Crypto Whales Are Back Apart from Ethereum, digital asset whales also purchased large assets on the White House Crypto Summit wave . Last week, BTC whales added 5,000 assets to their holdings, leading to slight gains. The top crypto trades at $83k, down 27% from previous highs. However, trader sentiments are surging as bulls gauge a rebound above $95k and subsequently to an all-time high. Solana, Cardano, and XRP also recorded whale accumulations within the week. Altcoin bulls remain fixed on possible ETF approvals to fuel a price run. Meanwhile, Litecoin whales amassed 430,000 assets in 48 hours.",Ethereum|News|Ethereum News,EN,0,0,ETH|TRADING|MARKET|ALTCOIN|BUSINESS,"{'name': 'ZyCrypto', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/zycrypto.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",zycrypto,2025-03-16 15:14:42

Among the top contenders, Arctic Pablo Coin (APC), GALA, and Internet Computer Protocol (ICP) stand out for their innovation and growth potential. APC’s presale is closing soon, offering an exclusive chance to buy before prices rise. GALA leads in blockchain gaming, while ICP is reshaping the internet with decentralized technology. Each project presents unique opportunities, making them prime investment options for those looking to capitalize on the next big wave in crypto. Don’t miss out! Arctic Pablo Coin: The Best Crypto to Invest in for High-Yield Potential Arctic Pablo Coin (APC) isn’t just another meme coin presale ; it’s an exhilarating journey that melds storytelling with investment opportunities. At its core, APC follows the daring explorer Arctic Pablo as he ventures into uncharted territories, uncovering hidden treasures symbolized by $APC tokens. This narrative-driven approach transforms the investment experience into an adventurous saga, captivating investors seeking both engagement and potential returns. With its unique approach and lucrative potential, APC is emerging as the best crypto to invest in for those looking for early entry into a high-growth project. The presale structure of APC is uniquely designed around Arctic Pablo’s expeditions, with each phase representing a new location brimming with mysteries and rewards. Currently, APC is in its 14th phase, known as Frosty Falls, with tokens priced at $0.000074. Investors have a limited window to acquire tokens at this rate before the next phase ushers in a price increase. This dynamic pricing model not only incentivizes early participation but also fosters a sense of urgency among potential investors. One of the standout features of APC is its deflationary mechanism. Unsold tokens are burned at the end of each presale phase, effectively reducing the total supply and potentially increasing the value of remaining tokens. This strategy creates a deflationary environment, enhancing the scarcity and desirability of APC. Investors who commit $200 in Arctic Pablo Coin today will receive approximately $2,702,608 $APC tokens. If the token lists at $0.008, this stake could soar to $21,620.86, representing a substantial return on investment. This potential for massive gains makes APC one of the best crypto to invest in before its listing. Moreover, APC offers a staking program with an impressive 66% Annual Percentage Yield (APY). By staking their tokens, investors can watch their holdings grow, further enhancing the appeal of this adventurous meme coin. The combination of a compelling narrative, strategic tokenomics, and attractive staking rewards positions Arctic Pablo Coin as the best crypto to invest in for those seeking both excitement and high returns in the crypto market. GALA: Pioneering Blockchain Gaming GALA is at the forefront of integrating blockchain technology with gaming, offering a decentralized platform where players have control over their in-game assets. This approach challenges traditional gaming models by empowering players and creators alike. As of today, GALA is trading at $0.01547, reflecting a 3.62% decline over the past 24 hours. Despite this recent dip, GALA maintains a market capitalization of approximately $586.6 million, underscoring its significant presence in the crypto space.​ GALA’s price trajectory has seen notable fluctuations. It reached an all-time high of $0.8248 in November 2021 but has since experienced a significant correction, currently trading 98.2% below that peak. Conversely, from its all-time low of $0.0001347 in December 2020, GALA has surged by an astounding 11,187.7%, showcasing its potential for substantial returns. The token’s circulating supply stands at approximately 43 billion GALA, with a total supply of 50 billion, indicating a relatively high supply that could influence its price dynamics.​ Internet Computer Protocol (ICP): Redefining the Internet Internet Computer Protocol (ICP) aims to revolutionize the internet by creating a decentralized platform that allows developers to build, host, and serve applications in a secure and scalable manner. This ambitious project seeks to transform the public internet into a global computing platform, challenging the dominance of centralized tech giants. As of today, ICP is trading at $5.10, reflecting a 5.82% decrease over the last 24 hours. The token’s market capitalization is approximately $2.47 billion, placing it among the top 50 cryptocurrencies by market cap.​ Since its launch, ICP has experienced significant price volatility. It reached an all-time high of $630.00 but has since corrected sharply, currently trading 99.19% below that peak. This dramatic decline highlights the inherent risks and volatility associated with emerging technologies in the crypto space. However, from its all-time low, ICP has shown resilience, indicating ongoing investor interest and confidence in its long-term vision.​ Final Thoughts: The Best Crypto to Invest Today Based on our research and market trends, Arctic Pablo Coin (APC), GALA, and Internet Computer Protocol (ICP) present three distinct investment opportunities. While GALA leads in blockchain gaming and ICP is a long-term bet on Web3, APC stands out as the most exciting investment right now due to its presale pricing, high staking rewards, and deflationary mechanism.

Investors who act today could see massive returns once the coin lists. Don’t wait—join the Arctic Pablo Coin presale now before this opportunity melts away!

Dogecoin , PEPE , and BONK have seen volatile trends, raising questions about their future. Could these popular tokens see a revival or further drops? This article explores recent market movements and potential price shifts, keeping investors on the edge of their seats for what comes next. Dogecoin's 6-Month Rally Amid Short-Term Setbacks DOGE dropped about 33% over the last month, with a 9% decline in a single week, while achieving a 75% rise over the past six months. Recent performance shows volatility, indicated by short-term indicators like the Awesome Oscillator and Momentum in the negative range, and an RSI close to 38.37. The historical data reflects a turbulent short-term cycle contrasted by impressive long-term growth. The coin now trades between $0.1446 and $0.2962, with immediate resistance near $0.39 and a backup level at $0.542, while support sits around $0.0872. Bears dominate the near-term market. Traders may look to buy near support and set targets around resistance for a possible bounce amid range-bound conditions. Pepe's Volatile Journey: Shifts and Key Levels in Focus Pepe dropped nearly 27% in the past month, while the six-month decline was modest at around 1.4%. A one-week gain of 6.31% indicates brief recoveries amidst the overall volatility. Price swings have been notable, with sharp short-term dips often met by occasional bounces. This behavior reflects a market that struggles between bursts of momentum and significant sell-offs. The current price range is between $0.00000534 and $0.00001239. Resistance is near $0.00001686, with support around $0.00000278. Technical signals, such as an RSI of 43.31, suggest a lack of clear trend. Traders may consider a break above resistance as a potential buying opportunity or use the lower support level for cautious entry. Bonk Altcoin Faces Steep Declines in Recent Months Bonk dropped nearly 37% in the past month and lost about 32% over the last six months. A one-week fall of roughly 6% adds to the overall downward trend observed during these periods. Price behavior reflects persistent weakness with minimal signs of reversal based on historical performance. Current price action sees resistance near $0.00003 and secondary resistance around $0.000044, while support rests at approximately $0.00000347. Bearish pressure dominates the market with no clear uptrend. Trading ideas include watching for a bounce near support before entering long positions or seeking consolidation breakouts above resistance. The RSI at 36.68 further warns of cautious moves in the current environment. Conclusion DOGE , PEPE , and BONK face a challenging market ahead. DOGE's popularity may not be enough to sustain its value. PEPE shows inconsistent trends, making its future unclear. BONK's recent slow growth raises concerns about its potential. Therefore, investors should watch these coins closely as changes could happen quickly. Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

The Nasdaq 100 has plunged 11% from its February peak, and the S&P 500 has dropped 10% from recent highs. The so-called Magnificent Seven—Apple, Microsoft, Nvidia, Alphabet, Amazon, Meta, and Tesla—are now trading at 26 times forward earnings, the lowest since September. But even after the decline, valuations still haven’t touched the lows of 2018 and 2022, when tech giants faced profit pressure. Some analysts believe this slide is far from over. Violeta Todorova, a senior research analyst at Leverage Shares, said : “While I acknowledge that valuations look a lot better than they did in December, I don’t think this is the bottom. I have been tempted to buy this dip, but there’s still so much uncertainty out there, and I think things will get worse before they get better.” Despite a small rally on Friday, Apple suffered its worst weekly decline in more than two years, dragging the Nasdaq 100 down 2.5% for the week. Big Tech’s Valuation Are Well Off Bottoms of Past Slumps | Source: Bloomberg Tech stocks sink as Trump’s policies shake investor confidence Big Tech stocks were hitting record highs just a month ago. Investors had bet that Trump’s economic policies would fuel growth and provide regulatory relief. Those expectations have collapsed. Trump and his officials have signaled that stock market losses and economic pain are acceptable in pursuit of a long-term restructuring of the U.S. economy. With that shift, investors have pulled back from risky assets. Big Tech, which has been the biggest winner since the bull market began in October 2022, is now taking the hardest losses. The selloff has sent Meta, Amazon, and Tesla tumbling. Tesla, which has been in a freefall for months, is still trading at 82 times forward earnings—far above its peers. Not all tech stocks are equally expensive. Apple, the second-most expensive, now trades at 29 times forward earnings, while Alphabet is the cheapest at 18 times. Even at that level, Alphabet’s valuation is still higher than the lows it hit in 2022. The broader selloff has also forced analysts to revise earnings estimates. Wall Street now projects Big Tech profits will grow 22% in 2025, down from 24% in January. In comparison, Big Tech earnings surged 34% in 2024. The S&P 500 is expected to post 12% profit growth in 2025, slightly up from 10% last year. Market liquidity concerns deepen as Big Tech struggles The Nasdaq 100 has tried to recover six times in 17 trading sessions, but each attempt has failed. Art Hogan, chief strategist at B. Riley Wealth, explained why traders aren’t stepping in: “No one is willing to step in and catch the falling knife. There’s so much uncertainty. That’s why we haven’t had a durable bounce.” The 14-day relative strength index for the Magnificent Seven fell below 24, the lowest since 2019. Even after rebounding to 36, it remains well below 70, the threshold for an overbought market. Nasdaq Rout Erases Nearly $4 Trillion in Market Value | Source: Bloomberg Another major issue is market liquidity. Historically, market crashes—from Black Monday in 1987 to the 2020 COVID-19 meltdown—have been worsened by liquidity drying up. Right now, the warning signs are flashing. The Cboe Volatility Index (VIX) nearly hit 30 before pulling back, but stocks have continued to fall. Options traders are adding to the chaos. More than $2 trillion in S&P 500 options trade daily, and a growing chunk of that is in zero-day contracts—short-term options expiring on the same day. These contracts now account for 56% of S&P 500 option volume, a level that’s high enough to move entire indexes. Stefano Amato, a senior fund manager at M&G Investments, said : “This activity is now sizable enough to materially affect the movement of major equity indexes such as the S&P 500 or the Nasdaq.” Derivatives trading is fueling stock volatility The biggest impact of derivatives trading isn’t being felt in indexes—it’s hitting individual stocks. Tesla, Nvidia, and Apple, all major players in options trading, have been dropping faster than the broader market. This isn’t new. The GameStop short squeeze in 2021 showed how options trading can drive wild price swings. Another event adding to the pressure is triple witching, when stock options, index options, and futures contracts expire at the same time. Trillions of dollars in contracts expired last week. While that usually triggers brief volatility, this time, it added to the broader selling pressure. GME US Equity | Source: Bloomberg Market makers have managed to keep liquidity relatively stable for now. But if they start pulling back, stocks could drop even further. Benedicte Lowe and Georges Debbas, equity strategists at BNP Paribas, explained why that matters: “Liquidity is clearly key for underlying spot markets to absorb the flow generated from the option Greeks.” If market makers withdraw liquidity, stocks could overshoot downward before finding a real bottom. For now, investors are watching the Federal Reserve’s next move, the broader economic picture, and whether Big Tech’s AI-driven profit boom can hold up. Violeta Todorova summed up what’s driving investor hesitation: “This is really less about fundamentals and more about the macro and geopolitical picture.” Big Tech isn’t out of the woods yet.

According to a CryptoQuant report , bitcoin’s correction is not unusual in terms of magnitude because such dips have been witnessed in past bull runs. However, the state of all valuation metrics suggests the leading cryptocurrency is either at deep value levels or in a deeper correction phase than typically seen during bull seasons. BTC in Bearish Territory? CryptoQuant said all Bitcoin valuation metrics indicate that the market is in bearish territory. The Bitcoin Bull-Bear Market Cycle Indicator is at its most bearish level in this cycle, while the Market Value to Realized Value (MVRV) Ratio Z-score has plunged below its 365-day moving average. The MVRV Ratio Z-score’s fall below its 365-day moving average indicates that bitcoin’s upward price momentum has become weak. Historical data reveals that when the MVRV Ratio and the Bull-Bear Market Cycle Indicator fall to their current levels, then BTC is either in a sharp correction or at the brink of a bear market. Bitcoin demand is not left out. This metric is still in contraction territory, and whales have reduced their accumulation pace. Last week, Bitcoin’s apparent demand contracted at its fastest pace since July 2024, plummeting swiftly by 103,000 BTC. Besides whales, other large investors are seeing their annual rate of BTC accumulation fall significantly—from 368,000 BTC in January to 268,000 BTC today. BTC Could Fall to $63K With the growth of large investors’ holdings falling, U.S.-based spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) have become net BTC sellers – a trend that sharply contrasts their purchases in the same period last year. CryptoQuant found that spot Bitcoin ETFs have cumulatively bought BTC worth $0.7 billion so far this year, a far cry from the $8.7 billion purchases seen this time in 2024. This indicates that these funds have been net sellers this year, putting additional downward pressure on bitcoin’s price. Additionally, the volume of BTC flowing into the American crypto exchange Coinbase from other trading platforms has fallen below the 90-day moving average. This is evident in CryptoQuant’s Inter-exchange Flow Pulse, which has been in a period of price correction since February 13 while BTC was trading around $96,000. Coins often flow into Coinbase when demand is high. Meanwhile, CryptoQuant analysts think BTC could plummet to $63,000 if it fails to hold the support level between $75,000 and $78,000. The asset was worth $82,000 at press time, and $63,000 represents the Trader’s minimum On-chain Realized Price minimum band.

According to analysts, the expansion of stablecoin supply indicates that the current crypto market pullback is only the middle of the bull cycle. Booming Stablecoin Supply A Bullish Sign For Crypto Bull Cycle Just when some were ready to declare the crypto bull cycle over, a key indicator has flashed green. According to crypto analytics firm IntoTheBlock, historical data shows that stablecoin supply peaks typically align with market cycle tops. The previous peak, at $187 billion, was recorded in April 2022, just before the bear market started. “Now it’s at $219B and still rising, suggesting we’re likely still mid-cycle,” IntoTheBlock wrote in a recent X post. Stablecoins are types of cryptocurrencies designed to hold a steady price, predominantly anchored to the U.S. dollar. They are a popular source of liquidity for crypto trading, acting as “dry powder” to trade assets on exchanges and transfer value on blockchain rails. Notably, European regulations have pushed crypto firms to delist USDT from their platforms. Specifically, the European Union’s Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA) framework requires European crypto asset providers to delist USDT and other non-MiCA-compliant tokens. Despite the delisting hurdle, USDT remains the world’s largest stablecoin and the third-biggest digital asset, with a $143.4 billion market cap. Meanwhile, the rising stablecoin supply can suggest imminent buying pressure and increasing investor demand. CoinGecko data shows that Bitcoin sunk to $77,000 earlier this week—its lowest point since early November—before a minor recovery took the asset back to $83,294 at the time of writing . The soaring stablecoin circulation could act as dry powder to fuel a massive crypto market rally in the foreseeable future. Despite the possibility for short-term volatility, investors remain hopeful for the rest of 2025. Analysts at VanEck have predicted that the foremost crypto could hit $180,000 in this cycle.",Cryptocurrency|News|stablecoin,EN,0,0,TRADING|MARKET|USDT|BUSINESS|BLOCKCHAIN,"{'name': 'ZyCrypto', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/zycrypto.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",zycrypto,2025-03-16 15:21:38

Altcoins suffered over the weekend, extending long-term losses above double-digits. While the bear phase tightens its grip on traders, bulls expect a reversal by April. Total assets outflows hit 4.5% in the last 24 hours, while the market cap plunged to $2.7 trillion. XRP To 10x In Projected Rebound Crypto trader Egrag Crypto wrote on X that XRP price is expected to bounce 10X alongside other altcoins. According to this view, a wider market upswing would be characterized by heightened whale volumes to hit such levels. At press time, XRP price stands at $2.21, falling 1% today. A 10X upward swing will spur the asset over $20, taking its market cap to unprecedented highs. This projection is a far stretch to many, as the asset has yet to break $4 this cycle. Last year, XRP became an institutional favorite, breaking the $3 mark for the first time in two years. The asset plunged below $1 for months after the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) filed a lawsuit against Ripple and its two executives for allegedly offering unregistered securities. Massive institutional interest sparked the rebound as bulls cited clear rules and global partnerships. At the moment, similar sentiments are at play with the formulation of the crypto task force in the United States. The group, among others, will help usher in clear rules setting the tone for more investment. Following Donald Trump’s inauguration, XRP bulls maintained a greedy approach before the market dip. Analysts Marzell say XRP could pick up gains before the next bull run. “XRP has formed a descending channel pattern on the daily timeframe after consolidating between $2.00-$3.00. This continuation pattern suggests accumulation before the next leg up. A bounce from the current support at $2.12 could drive the price toward targets at $2.32, $2.61, $2.90, and $3.35.” What’s Next For Altcoins? Egrag Crypto also pointed to altcoin inflows as traders find more confidence. This can be seen in recent whale holdings with large holders buying the dip. Last week, Ethereum whales added over 400,000 assets, transferring a larger number off exchanges. XRP and Solana dropped 14% and 17% in the past seven days before recent inflows. While altcoins are yet to record Q4 2024 successes , traders are keen on a recovery ahead of a rebound.",Cryptocurrency|News|Ripple|XRP News,EN,0,0,XRP|ALTCOIN|ZRX|TRADING|MARKET,"{'name': 'ZyCrypto', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/zycrypto.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",zycrypto,2025-03-16 15:41:28

Carney, a former central banker, immediately addressed the growing tensions with President Donald Trump, telling reporters that discussions with the U.S. administration had made “progress” despite the economic standoff. “I respect what he is looking to accomplish,” Carney said. “We’ll both be looking out for our countries. He knows, and I know from long experience, that we can find mutual solutions that win for both.” Carney builds smaller cabinet ahead of looming election Carney moved quickly to restructure Canada’s government, rolling out a cabinet smaller than Trudeau’s and designed for short-term governance. An election is expected in weeks, and Carney is assembling a team built for the moment. Francois-Philippe Champagne is now finance minister, Dominic LeBlanc moves to international trade, Melanie Joly remains in charge of foreign affairs, and David McGuinty continues as public safety minister. The new prime minister wasted no time setting the tone for his administration. “Canada’s new government will be action-oriented, driven by a smaller but highly experienced team made to meet the moment we are in,” Carney said . His immediate focus: “Protecting Canadian workers and their families in the face of unjustified foreign trade actions. And second, growing this great country by putting more money in Canadians’ pockets.” Carney’s arrival in politics is unlike anything seen before. He is the first Canadian prime minister in over 150 years to take office without ever holding a House of Commons or Senate seat. The last person to do so was in 1867. His first challenge? Handling Trump’s economic aggression. The U.S. has imposed harsh tariffs on Canadian goods, and Canada has retaliated. Trump has also suggested that Canada should join the U.S., an idea Secretary of State Marco Rubio recently backed by making an economic case for it. Carney dismissed the suggestion outright. “It’s crazy,” he said. “Before we get to the economics of it, we won’t be part of it. And when we get to the economics, and the president is a successful businessperson and dealmaker—we’re his largest client in so many industries.” He added, “Clients expect respect and working together in a proper commercial way. So the nature of Canada means we won’t, the economics means we shouldn’t.” The economic fight is already affecting business confidence. Consumer spending is slowing, and with more tariffs set to hit next month, some economists warn that Canada could fall into a recession before the year ends. Carney has no immediate plans to visit the U.S., saying he would speak with Trump at the “appropriate moment.” Carney scraps carbon tax, faces political battle with Poilievre Carney’s first major policy move was to eliminate the consumer carbon tax, a controversial policy under Trudeau’s government that had become a political burden. Conservative leader Pierre Poilievre had long blamed the tax for making life more expensive, and with inflation still high, Carney removed it immediately. The upcoming election will be a direct contest between Carney and Poilievre, but the Conservatives’ once-massive lead in the polls has shrunk. Poilievre has attacked Carney’s new cabinet, arguing that it’s just the same group of politicians from Trudeau’s administration with minor changes. “Mark Carney thinks Canadians are stupid,” Poilievre said. “He thinks that a little bit of cosmetic surgery will allow the Liberals to disguise who they are and make people forget what they did for 10 years.” Carney’s first cabinet meeting took place on Friday afternoon. He reduced the number of ministers from 37 to 24 to create a leaner team. He moved Steven Guilbeault from environment to a new Canadian culture and identity role, put Rachel Bendayan in charge of immigration, and named Anita Anand as industry minister. Chrystia Freeland, Carney’s rival in the Liberal leadership race, was given the transport and internal trade portfolio. Jonathan Wilkinson remains as energy minister. Carney is no stranger to handling economic crises. During his time as Bank of Canada governor, he navigated the country through the 2008 financial crisis, slashing interest rates to nearly zero. As Bank of England governor, he managed the UK’s economy through Brexit turmoil. But this time, it’s different. Politics is an entirely new arena, and he knows he needs a mandate from voters. He told reporters an election announcement is coming “in the coming days.” While Carney focuses on domestic issues, he is also turning to foreign relations. He plans to travel to France and the UK next week to strengthen alliances with European partners, who are also caught in Trump’s trade war. Meanwhile, his office is preparing a phone call with Ukraine’s President Volodymyr Zelenskiy, signaling that Canada will continue to support Ukraine amid ongoing tensions.

As market volatility continues, traders are closely watching key support and resistance levels to determine Ethereum’s (ETH) next move. ETH Price Action Support and Resistance Levels Ethereum’s immediate support stands at $1,864.54. Holding above this level could stabilize the price and prevent further declines. However, if ETH falls below it, the next support at $1,802.98 may come into play, signaling further weakness and increased selling pressure. On the upside, Ethereum faces resistance at $1,965.43. A breakout above this level could trigger bullish momentum, with the next key target at $2,004.78. Sustained buying pressure beyond this point could reinforce a long-term uptrend and attract more investors. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Technical Indicators: RSI and MACD Analysis Ethereum’s RSI remains neutral, indicating neither overbought nor oversold conditions, suggesting price consolidation with no clear trend. Meanwhile, the MACD remains negative, reflecting bearish sentiment. However, if the MACD line crosses above the signal line, it could signal rising buying momentum and a potential bullish reversal. Ethereum’s Short-Term Outlook Ethereum’s movement depends on whether it holds support at $1,864.54 or declines toward $1,802.98. A drop below this level could lead to further losses, while a breakout above $1,965.43 may push ETH toward $2,004.78, signaling renewed bullish strength. Traders should monitor market volume, investor sentiment, and macroeconomic factors to assess Ethereum’s potential directio n. A strong breakout above resistance could drive demand, while persistent selling pressure may limit upside potential and keep ETH in a bearish phase.

If it manages to reclaim this level, the next target will likely be the $90K region. Technical Analysis By Shayan The Daily Chart BTC’s recent price action has seen a slight rebound from the ascending wedge’s lower boundary, which aligns with the 0.618 Fibonacci retracement level at $78K. This confluence of support levels strengthens the likelihood of buyers defending this area in the mid-term. However, Bitcoin has now headed toward a key resistance zone at $85K, which coincides with the 0.5 Fibonacci retracement level and the 200-day moving average. While a breakout above this region could trigger a surge toward the $90K threshold, the presence of sellers at this level suggests that further consolidation is the more probable short-term scenario. The 4-Hour Chart On the lower timeframe, Bitcoin’s recent upward movement has brought it close to the upper boundary of the descending wedge at $85K. This pattern often signals a bullish market rebound if the price breaches the upper trendline. If Bitcoin sustains its momentum and successfully breaks above this resistance, a rally toward the $90K level will likely follow. However, given the current market conditions and the lack of strong buying demand, further consolidation within the wedge remains the more likely short-term outcome. On-chain Analysis By Shayan The Realized Cap UTXO Age Bands (%) is a valuable on-chain metric that illustrates the distribution percentage of Bitcoin based on the duration they have been held. According to the latest data, the percentage of coins held for 3 to 6 months has been rising rapidly, mirroring the accumulation patterns observed during the prolonged correction in the summer of 2024. This trend highlights a holding sentiment, where investors refrain from selling their Bitcoin despite the current market correction. Historically, this type of resilience among Bitcoin holders has played a crucial role in forming market bottoms and igniting new uptrends. As long-term holders continue accumulating, the available supply in circulation decreases, making Bitcoin more scarce. When demand eventually picks up, this supply squeeze often leads to price surges, pushing Bitcoin toward new record highs. Given this behavior, the data suggests that Bitcoin’s current market phase is more of a healthy correction rather than the start of a prolonged bear market. Many market participants still view Bitcoin as a long-term valuable investment, reinforcing the potential for an eventual bullish continuation.

Bitcoin ( BTC ) held steady above $84,000, while the market cap of all coins rose to over $2.8 trillion. The crypto market will have two main catalysts this week: President Donald Trump’s tariffs and the Federal Reserve’s interest rate decisions. A sign of Trump easing his stand on tariffs and a more dovish Fed will be bullish for cryptocurrencies and other risky assets. The top cryptocurrencies to watch this week will be Binance Coin ( BNB ), Cronos ( CRO ), and ZetaChain ( ZETA ). BNB BNB price chart | Source: crypto.news BNB price will be in the spotlight this week as the developers activate the Pascal hard fork on March 20. This is one of the three upgrades scheduled for the year’s first half. It is set to introduce newer features, including more Ethereum compatibility, native smart contract wallets, and more security. The other two upgrades will improve BNB Chain’s speed and security. This is happening as the BSC Chain becomes one of the best alternatives to Ethereum ( ETH ) and Solana ( SOL ). Ethereum has higher fees and is slow, while the Solana network is highly associated with meme coins.

This crucial vote seeks to determine the creation of the Cronos Strategic Reserve . It aims to do that by undoing a 70 billion token burn that happened in 2021. If the vote passes, Cronos will create 70 billion tokens and use them to create a reserve that will be used to support the ecosystem. Critics argue that creating these new tokens will dilute existing investors by adding to the supply. Voting data shows that 45.8% of users have voted in support of the proposal, while 44.4% have rejected it. 9.27% have abstained. If the vote ends like this, the proposal will be rejected as the turnout is less than the quorum. ZetaChain Zetachain price chart | Source: crypto.news ZetaChain is another top cryptocurrency to watch after its price crashed to a record low of $0.2070. It has dropped by over 92% from its all-time high, bringing its market cap to $151 million. One reason for the ZETA price crash is that the total value locked in its ecosystem has crashed to $13 million from its all-time high of near $20 million. The other reason is that Zetachain is highly dilutive as it has a circulating supply of 731 million against a total supply of 2.1 billion. The network will unlock tokens worth over $6.6 million, representing 4.29% of the float this week. Cryptocurrencies are often highly volatile when there is a major unlock.

This development marks a major milestone for ADA, further integrating the asset into the global derivatives market and expanding its appeal to both institutional and retail traders. With this addition, ADA joins the ranks of other major cryptocurrencies with futures markets, solidifying its position as a leading digital asset. As the cryptocurrency market continues to mature, this move is expected to drive increased liquidity, price discovery, and institutional interest in Cardano. Why Coinbase’s ADA Futures Launch Is a Game-Changer The introduction of ADA futures on Coinbase provides traders with a new way to gain exposure to Cardano, offering both long and short positions to capitalize on price movements. Futures contracts allow traders to speculate on ADA’s future price without directly holding the asset, giving them more flexibility in their trading strategies. This move enhances market efficiency by providing more avenues for price discovery, reducing volatility, and improving liquidity. JUST IN: Coinbase is launching Cardano $ADA futures to its 100M+ users. pic.twitter.com/V6BoyIVdKo — TapTools (@TapTools) March 14, 2025 Coinbase’s influence in the cryptocurrency industry cannot be overstated. As one of the most trusted and regulated exchanges, its decision to launch ADA futures signals confidence in Cardano’s long-term potential. This also aligns with the broader trend of institutional adoption, as major financial players increasingly seek regulated venues to trade crypto derivatives. Institutional Demand and Market Impact The launch of ADA futures comes at a time when institutional demand for cryptocurrency derivatives is on the rise. Futures contracts provide institutions with hedging tools and risk management options, allowing them to take more structured positions in the crypto market. The presence of ADA futures on Coinbase could attract hedge funds, asset managers, and proprietary trading firms looking to incorporate Cardano into their portfolios. Increased institutional participation often leads to deeper liquidity, tighter spreads, and reduced market manipulation, benefiting both retail and professional traders. Moreover, with Cardano being a proof-of-stake (PoS) blockchain, futures trading will provide an additional layer of engagement for traders who might not be interested in direct staking but still want exposure to ADA’s price action. This could result in increased speculative activity around Cardano, influencing market dynamics in the coming months. Cardano’s Growing Institutional Recognition Cardano has long been regarded as one of the most fundamentally strong blockchain networks, known for its scalability, sustainability, and peer-reviewed research-driven development. However, its lack of widespread derivatives trading options has limited its accessibility compared to other major cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 With Coinbase adding ADA futures, Cardano gains a stronger foothold in the institutional market, reinforcing its credibility among serious investors. This also follows a broader trend of regulated exchanges expanding their futures offerings, as demand for alternative blockchain projects grows beyond just Bitcoin and Ethereum. Additionally, this move could attract more institutional capital into the Cardano ecosystem, potentially leading to greater adoption of its smart contract platform and decentralized applications (dApps). Increased trading volume in futures markets often leads to higher spot market activity, further strengthening ADA’s price stability and market depth. The Future of ADA Futures Trading Coinbase’s decision to introduce ADA futures underscores the growing recognition of Cardano as a major player in the crypto space. As derivatives trading expands, ADA could see increased price action, driven by both speculative interest and genuine institutional adoption. The availability of futures contracts also sets the stage for more sophisticated trading strategies, allowing users to hedge against volatility, leverage positions, and engage in advanced market-making activities. With Cardano’s strong fundamentals, ongoing technological upgrades , and increasing adoption, the launch of ADA futures on Coinbase could catalyze the next phase of growth, attracting more investors and reinforcing its position in the evolving cryptocurrency landscape.

Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is riding strong bullish momentum, positioning itself as top performers for explosive growth in the coming months. The project is in phase 3 of its presale priced at $0.02. Mutuum Finance’s presale surges past $3.4 million with over 5500 investors already onboard. As Mutuum Finance enters Phase 4, the price will jump 25% to $0.025. MUTM could be the next big winner for those who seek greater gains and long term investment. Experts have set an ambitious target for MUTM, forecasting a staggering 15540% increase, which would propel its value to $9.3, potentially outpacing DOGE and SHIB. Transforming DeFi Lending with a Hybrid Model Mutuum Finance is revolutionizing decentralized lending by merging both Peer-to-Contract (P2C) and Peer-to-Peer (P2P) models. The P2C model allows users to lock stablecoins like USDT in liquidity pools backed by smart contracts, receiving passive income while making it easy for borrowers to borrow money easily. Meanwhile, the P2P model eliminates middlemen, allowing lenders and borrowers to directly negotiate with each other. This two-pronged approach maximizes security, efficiency, and decentralization and positions Mutuum Finance at the forefront of the DeFi universe. By giving users full control over their lending decisions, the platform is appealing to conservative and high-yield investors, and facilitates a more open and flexible financial system. A DeFi Disruptor Drawing Massive Investor Interest Mutuum Finance is rapidly generating buzz in the DeFi community with its game-changing lending solutions. Despite being in presale, it has already surpassed more than $3.2 million in funding and has amassed nearly 5700 investors, making it a solid altcoin ready to experience a major breakthrough. With the Phase 3 price at $0.02 and with an impending 33.33% price boost in the next phase, early investors stand to gain good returns in terms of bagging their highest returns. At launch, with an anticipated price of $0.06, profits could be 200%, and for the next bull cycle, projections see the leap over $9.3. Mutuum Finance establishes its security foundation through the launch of an entirely collateralized stablecoin on the Ethereum blockchain. The over-collateralization requirement in this model eliminates volatility risks that break algorithmic stablecoins due to their instability. The platform establishes investor confidence by employing multiple auditing activities on smart contracts together with financially transparent systems to repair DeFi lending platform vulnerabilities. Mutuum Finance emphasizes sustainability and security thus establishing itself as an excellent option for investors making long-term decisions. Exclusive Rewards and Community Incentives The initial supporters of Mutuum Finance can benefit from multiple enticing rewards which offer both generous giveaways of $100,000 awarded through $10,000 MUTM token distributions to ten winners alongside a referral program that rewards its users for new investor acquisitions. The referral system of Mutuum Finance motivates users to recruit new investors while providing rewards to these referrals. Users who join early receive privileged access to future staking pools and they obtain governance privileges while receiving first access to platform upgrade updates. The incentives provided by Mutuum Finance motivate users to join initially while developing better long-term retention of token holders. A Strategic Vision for Sustainable Growth Mutuum Finance created its tokenomics framework to promote sustainable value through proper management of liquidity and strategic partnerships and security features with anti-inflation measures. The basis for enduring token price appreciation comes from a controlled distribution process during the presale phase alongside proper management techniques. The payout system for token staking pumps out steady passive revenue which retains both investors’ commitment and protects token sustainability levels. The deflationary mechanisms function over time to reduce network supply which leads to increased scarcity thereby strengthening price growth potential for the long term. The platform MUTM is changing the shape of DeFi by attracting key whale investors and raising its funds beyond $3.4 million. Early investors who participate in Phase 3 at $0.02 will see substantial financial growth until the price reaches $9.3 while a forthcoming 25% price increase is projected. Purchase MUTM tokens during the current presale stage to obtain your position in DeFi’s upcoming developments.

This growing momentum has sparked interest from market enthusiasts, with prominent crypto analyst Ali Martinez projecting the XLM token to soon experience a sustained price rise. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Breaking Out Of This Pattern — Can BTC Reclaim $90,000? XLM Primed For 40% Price Gain In an X post on March 15, Martinez shared an intriguing projection for Stellar price after rebounding off a crucial level. Martinez noted that the altcoin could be on its way to a new local high over the coming weeks. This bullish projection is based on the formation of a descending channel pattern on the XLM daily chart. For context, a descending channel is a common pattern in technical analysis characterized by two major (downward-sloping) trendlines. The upper boundary line connects a series of lower highs and the lower channel line connects the lower lows. The asset’s price typically persists within the channel; with the upper boundary line acting as resistance and the lower channel line considered a support floor. The descending channel formation is usually a bearish pattern, indicating the persistence of a downward trend. When the price breaks down the lower channel line, it signals the continuation of the downtrend. Conversely, a break out of the descending channel can be used to identify trend reversal points — usually from a bearish trend to an upward trend. XLM’s price has been in this descending channel since November 2024, recently bouncing back from the lower boundary line. As observed in the chart above, the altcoin fell to support around the $0.23 level in early March, but it has since turned around toward the channel’s midline. According to Martinez, the next price target for XLM is $0.30 at the channel’s midline. However, the analyst believes Stellar could make a play for as high as $0.38 at the upper boundary line i.e. representing a potential 40% surge from the current market price. The last time the Stellar traded around the $0.38 region was in early February and has since plummeted as low as $0.23 since then. Stellar Price Overview As of this writing, the XLM token is valued at around $0.27, reflecting a 0.83% gain in the past 24 hours. According to data from CoinMarketCap, the Stellar price is down by 0.76% in the last seven days despite the woeful start to the week. Meanwhile, the altcoin’s value has declined by 17.25% in the past month. Related Reading: XRP Price To $110?

We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Market Indicators Signal Uncertainty Currently, the MACD (Moving Average Convergence Divergence) indicator is near zero, reflecting market indecision. A bullish crossover above the signal line could trigger renewed buying momentum, pushing XRP toward higher resistance levels. Meanwhile, the RSI (Relative Strength Index) stands at 51.37, indicating a mild bullish sentiment. While not signaling an extreme buying or selling condition, it suggests XRP is in a consolidation phase, where neither bulls nor bears hold a clear advantage. Awaiting a Clear Trend With both MACD and RSI reflecting a state of uncertainty, XRP’s next major move will depend on whether buyers or sellers gain control. If a strong catalyst emerges, it could break out of consolidation and establish a definitive trend. Traders should closely monitor the $2.25 support and $2.42 resistance zones, as price action around these levels will likely determine XRP’s next significant move. Whether it rebounds or dips further, the market is primed for a shift, making this a pivotal moment for XRP holders and investors.

The rise of digital thieves,https://cointelegraph.com/explained/can-ai-bots-steal-your-crypto-the-rise-of-digital-thieves?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound,"What are AI bots? AI bots are self-learning software that automates and continuously refines crypto cyberattacks, making them more dangerous than traditional hacking methods. At the heart of today’s AI-driven cybercrime are AI bots — self-learning software programs designed to process vast amounts of data, make independent decisions, and execute complex tasks without human intervention. While these bots have been a game-changer in industries like finance, healthcare and customer service, they have also become a weapon for cybercriminals, particularly in the world of cryptocurrency. Unlike traditional hacking methods, which require manual effort and technical expertise, AI bots can fully automate attacks, adapt to new cryptocurrency security measures, and even refine their tactics over time. This makes them far more effective than human hackers, who are limited by time, resources and error-prone processes. Why are AI bots so dangerous? The biggest threat posed by AI-driven cybercrime is scale. A single hacker attempting to breach a crypto exchange or trick users into handing over their private keys can only do so much. AI bots, however, can launch thousands of attacks simultaneously, refining their techniques as they go. Speed: AI bots can scan millions of blockchain transactions, smart contracts and websites within minutes, identifying weaknesses in wallets (leading to crypto wallet hacks), decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols and exchanges. Scalability: A human scammer may send phishing emails to a few hundred people. An AI bot can send personalized, perfectly crafted phishing emails to millions in the same time frame. Adaptability: Machine learning allows these bots to improve with every failed attack, making them harder to detect and block. This ability to automate, adapt and attack at scale has led to a surge in AI-driven crypto fraud, making crypto fraud prevention more critical than ever. ​In October 2024, the X account of Andy Ayrey, developer of the AI bot Truth Terminal , was compromised by hackers. The attackers used Ayrey’s account to promote a fraudulent memecoin named Infinite Backrooms (IB). The malicious campaign led to a rapid surge in IB’s market capitalization, reaching $25 million. Within 45 minutes, the perpetrators liquidated their holdings, securing over $600,000. How AI-powered bots can steal cryptocurrency assets AI-powered bots aren’t just automating crypto scams — they’re becoming smarter, more targeted and increasingly hard to spot. Here are some of the most dangerous types of AI-driven scams currently being used to steal cryptocurrency assets: 1. AI-powered phishing bots Phishing attacks are nothing new in crypto, but AI has turned them into a far bigger threat. Instead of sloppy emails full of mistakes, today’s AI bots create personalized messages that look exactly like real communications from platforms such as Coinbase or MetaMask. They gather personal information from leaked databases, social media and even blockchain records, making their scams extremely convincing. For instance, in early 2024, an AI-driven phishing attack targeted Coinbase users by sending emails about fake cryptocurrency security alerts, ultimately tricking users out of nearly $65 million. Also, after OpenAI launched GPT-4 , scammers created a fake OpenAI token airdrop site to exploit the hype. They sent emails and X posts luring users to “claim” a bogus token — the phishing page closely mirrored OpenAI’s real site ​. Victims who took the bait and connected their wallets had all their crypto assets drained automatically. Unlike old-school phishing, these AI-enhanced scams are polished and targeted, often free of the typos or clumsy wording that is used to give away a phishing scam. Some even deploy AI chatbots posing as customer support representatives for exchanges or wallets , tricking users into divulging private keys or two-factor authentication (2FA) codes under the guise of “verification.” In 2022, some malware specifically targeted browser-based wallets like MetaMask: a strain called Mars Stealer could sniff out private keys for over 40 different wallet browser extensions and 2FA apps, draining any funds it found. Such malware often spreads via phishing links, fake software downloads or pirated crypto tools. Once inside your system, it might monitor your clipboard (to swap in the attacker’s address when you copy-paste a wallet address), log your keystrokes, or export your seed phrase files — all without obvious signs. 2. AI-powered exploit-scanning bots Smart contract vulnerabilities are a hacker’s goldmine, and AI bots are taking advantage faster than ever. These bots continuously scan platforms like Ethereum or BNB Smart Chain, hunting for flaws in newly deployed DeFi projects. As soon as they detect an issue, they exploit it automatically, often within minutes. Researchers have demonstrated that AI chatbots, such as those powered by GPT-3, can analyze smart contract code to identify exploitable weaknesses. For instance, Stephen Tong, co-founder of Zellic, showcased an AI chatbot detecting a vulnerability in a smart contract’s “withdraw” function, similar to the flaw exploited in the Fei Protocol attack, which resulted in an $80-million loss. 3. AI-enhanced brute-force attacks Brute-force attacks used to take forever, but AI bots have made them dangerously efficient. By analyzing previous password breaches, these bots quickly identify patterns to crack passwords and seed phrases in record time. A 2024 study on desktop cryptocurrency wallets, including Sparrow, Etherwall and Bither, found that weak passwords drastically lower resistance to brute-force attacks, emphasizing that strong, complex passwords are crucial to safeguarding digital assets. 4. Deepfake impersonation bots Imagine watching a video of a trusted crypto influencer or CEO asking you to invest — but it’s entirely fake. That’s the reality of deepfake scams powered by AI. These bots create ultra-realistic videos and voice recordings, tricking even savvy crypto holders into transferring funds. 5. Social media botnets On platforms like X and Telegram, swarms of AI bots push crypto scams at scale. Botnets such as “Fox8” used ChatGPT to generate hundreds of persuasive posts hyping scam tokens and replying to users in real-time. In one case, scammers abused the names of Elon Musk and ChatGPT to promote a fake crypto giveaway — complete with a deepfaked video of Musk — duping people into sending funds to scammers. In 2023, Sophos researchers found crypto romance scammers using ChatGPT to chat with multiple victims at once, making their affectionate messages more convincing and scalable.​ Similarly, Meta reported a sharp uptick in malware and phishing links disguised as ChatGPT or AI tools, often tied to crypto fraud schemes. And in the realm of romance scams, AI is boosting so-called pig butchering operations — long-con scams where fraudsters cultivate relationships and then lure victims into fake crypto investments. A striking case occurred in Hong Kong in 2024: Police busted a criminal ring that defrauded men across Asia of $46 million via an AI-assisted romance scam​. Automated trading bot scams and exploits AI is being invoked in the arena of cryptocurrency trading bots — often as a buzzword to con investors and occasionally as a tool for technical exploits. A notable example is YieldTrust.ai, which in 2023 marketed an AI bot supposedly yielding 2.2% returns per day — an astronomical, implausible profit. Regulators from several states investigated and found no evidence the “AI bot” even existed; it appeared to be a classic Ponzi, using AI as a tech buzzword to suck in victims​. YieldTrust.ai was ultimately shut down by authorities, but not before investors were duped by the slick marketing. Even when an automated trading bot is real, it’s often not the money-printing machine scammers claim. For instance, blockchain analysis firm Arkham Intelligence highlighted a case where a so-called arbitrage trading bot (likely touted as AI-driven) executed an incredibly complex series of trades, including a $200-million flash loan — and ended up netting a measly $3.24 in profit​. In fact, many “AI trading” scams will take your deposit and, at best, run it through some random trades (or not trade at all), then make excuses when you try to withdraw. Some shady operators also use social media AI bots to fabricate a track record (e.g., fake testimonials or X bots that constantly post “winning trades”) to create an illusion of success. It’s all part of the ruse. On the more technical side, criminals do use automated bots (not necessarily AI, but sometimes labeled as such) to exploit the crypto markets and infrastructure. Front-running bots in DeFi, for example, automatically insert themselves into pending transactions to steal a bit of value (a sandwich attack ), and flash loan bots execute lightning-fast trades to exploit price discrepancies or vulnerable smart contracts. These require coding skills and aren’t typically marketed to victims; instead, they’re direct theft tools used by hackers. AI could enhance these by optimizing strategies faster than a human. However, as mentioned, even highly sophisticated bots don’t guarantee big gains — the markets are competitive and unpredictable, something even the fanciest AI can’t reliably foresee​. Meanwhile, the risk to victims is real: If a trading algorithm malfunctions or is maliciously coded, it can wipe out your funds in seconds. There have been cases of rogue bots on exchanges triggering flash crashes or draining liquidity pools, causing users to incur huge slippage losses. How AI-powered malware fuels cybercrime against crypto users AI is teaching cybercriminals how to hack crypto platforms, enabling a wave of less-skilled attackers to launch credible attacks. This helps explain why crypto phishing and malware campaigns have scaled up so dramatically — AI tools let bad actors automate their scams and continuously refine them based on what works​. AI is also supercharging malware threats and hacking tactics aimed at crypto users. One concern is AI-generated malware, malicious programs that use AI to adapt and evade detection. In 2023, researchers demonstrated a proof-of-concept called BlackMamba, a polymorphic keylogger that uses an AI language model (like the tech behind ChatGPT) to rewrite its code with every execution. This means each time BlackMamba runs, it produces a new variant of itself in memory, helping it slip past antivirus and endpoint security tools​. ​In tests, this AI-crafted malware went undetected by an industry-leading endpoint detection and response system​. Once active, it could stealthily capture everything the user types — including crypto exchange passwords or wallet seed phrases — and send that data to attackers​. While BlackMamba was just a lab demo, it highlights a real threat: Criminals can harness AI to create shape-shifting malware that targets cryptocurrency accounts and is much harder to catch than traditional viruses​. Even without exotic AI malware, threat actors abuse the popularity of AI to spread classic trojans. Scammers commonly set up fake “ChatGPT” or AI-related apps that contain malware, knowing users might drop their guard due to the AI branding. For instance, security analysts observed fraudulent websites impersonating the ChatGPT site with a “Download for Windows” button; if clicked, it silently installs a crypto-stealing Trojan on the victim’s machine​. Beyond the malware itself, AI is lowering the skill barrier for would-be hackers. Previously, a criminal needed some coding know-how to craft phishing pages or viruses. Now, underground “AI-as-a-service” tools do much of the work. Illicit AI chatbots like WormGPT and FraudGPT have appeared on dark web forums, offering to generate phishing emails, malware code and hacking tips on demand​. For a fee, even non-technical criminals can use these AI bots to churn out convincing scam sites, create new malware variants, and scan for software vulnerabilities​. How to protect your crypto from AI-driven attacks AI-driven threats are becoming more advanced, making strong security measures essential to protect digital assets from automated scams and hacks. Below are the most effective ways on how to protect crypto from hackers and defend against AI-powered phishing, deepfake scams and exploit bots: Use a hardware wallet: AI-driven malware and phishing attacks primarily target online (hot) wallets. By using hardware wallets — like Ledger or Trezor — you keep private keys completely offline, making them virtually impossible for hackers or malicious AI bots to access remotely. For instance, during the 2022 FTX collapse, those using hardware wallets avoided the massive losses suffered by users with funds stored on exchanges. Enable multifactor authentication (MFA) and strong passwords: AI bots can crack weak passwords using deep learning in cybercrime, leveraging machine learning algorithms trained on leaked data breaches to predict and exploit vulnerable credentials. To counter this, always enable MFA via authenticator apps like Google Authenticator or Authy rather than SMS-based codes — hackers have been known to exploit SIM swap vulnerabilities , making SMS verification less secure. Beware of AI-powered phishing scams: AI-generated phishing emails, messages and fake support requests have become nearly indistinguishable from real ones. Avoid clicking on links in emails or direct messages, always verify website URLs manually, and never share private keys or seed phrases, regardless of how convincing the request may seem. Verify identities carefully to avoid deepfake scams: AI-powered deepfake videos and voice recordings can convincingly impersonate crypto influencers, executives or even people you personally know. If someone is asking for funds or promoting an urgent investment opportunity via video or audio, verify their identity through multiple channels before taking action. Stay informed about the latest blockchain security threats: Regularly following trusted blockchain security sources such as CertiK, Chainalysis or SlowMist will keep you informed about the latest AI-powered threats and the tools available to protect yourself. The future of AI in cybercrime and crypto security As AI-driven crypto threats evolve rapidly, proactive and AI-powered security solutions become crucial to protecting your digital assets. Looking ahead, AI’s role in cybercrime is likely to escalate, becoming increasingly sophisticated and harder to detect. Advanced AI systems will automate complex cyberattacks like deepfake-based impersonations, exploit smart-contract vulnerabilities instantly upon detection, and execute precision-targeted phishing scams. To counter these evolving threats, blockchain security will increasingly rely on real-time AI threat detection. Platforms like CertiK already leverage advanced machine learning models to scan millions of blockchain transactions daily, spotting anomalies instantly. As cyber threats grow smarter, these proactive AI systems will become essential in preventing major breaches, reducing financial losses, and combating AI and financial fraud to maintain trust in crypto markets. Ultimately, the future of crypto security will depend heavily on industry-wide cooperation and shared AI-driven defense systems. Exchanges, blockchain platforms, cybersecurity providers and regulators must collaborate closely, using AI to predict threats before they materialize. While AI-powered cyberattacks will continue to evolve, the crypto community’s best defense is staying informed, proactive and adaptive — turning artificial intelligence from a threat into its strongest ally.",Ai|bots|crypto|steal,EN,0,0,TRADING|BLOCKCHAIN|MARKET|AIRDROP|EXCHANGE,"{'name': 'CoinTelegraph', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cointelegraph.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cointelegraph,2025-03-16 16:05:00

Tron historic price sentiment TRON price history Tron, founded by Justin Sun in 2017, raised $70 million through an ICO the same year; it launched its mainnet in May 2018 and migrated TRX from Ethereum to Tron in June, which temporarily boosted TRX’s price to $0.09. TRX reached an all-time high of $0.3004 in January 2018 before dropping below $0.05 a month later; it consistently traded under $0.05 until late 2020, when it began to rise again. In 2021, it reached a high of $0.16. Tron was also reorganized as a DAO as Justin stepped down as CEO of Tron Foundation. TRX was in a bear trend for the best part of 2022. In 2023, TRX maintained a consistent bull run, rising from a low of $0.05. In March 2023, the SEC sued Justin for allegedly selling unregistered securities and promoting Tron and Bittorent tokens. In February 2024, Circle’s announcement to cease USDC on Tron led TRX to correct from $0.1429. TRX held above $0.1234 until mid-May, then dropped to $0.1113. The price rebounded to $0.1398 in July but fell again to $0.1213 in early August. By late September, TRX recovered to $0.166, reaching $0.1691 in October and touching $0.2130 in late November. TRX ended 2024 with a price tag of $0.255. Tron was priced at $0.255 at the start of January 2025 and it was trading in a range of $0.204 to $0.257 in February. In March 2025, Tron (TRX) is trading near $0.24.",Crypto Price Predictions|TRON,EN,0,0,MARKET|BLOCKCHAIN|BUSINESS|TRADING|TRX|ICO|EXCHANGE|BNB|LINK|ASIA|USDT|USDD,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-03-16 16:07:42

It appears that Maximilian Staudinger wrote the five-page document and submitted it to the newly established SEC Crypto Task Force. According to the proposal , the US could see massive financial benefits if it makes XRP a payment asset. The proposal, which presupposes an integration of Ripple XRP into the US financial system, claims that it could unlock up to $1.5 trillion from Nostro accounts. Comprehensive Proposal to Make XRP a Strategic Financial Asset (Source: SEC) The Nostro accounts describe accounts held by banks with foreign banks and denominated in foreign currency to facilitate cross-border transactions. According to the document, $27 trillion is stored in these accounts worldwide, with the US holding $5 trillion of the funds. However, it believes that XRP can become the replacement liquidity for 30% of the fund. It added that XRP could also become the payment rail for financial transactions, saving the US up to $7.5 billion annually. While there are no clear details on how this will happen, it expects the government to use XRP for state-level payments, including Social Security. Meanwhile, the proposal also mentioned the Bitcoin reserve, noting that the $1.5 trillion from the Nostro accounts will go towards acquiring Bitcoin for the strategic reserve. However, it incorrectly claimed that the US could buy up to 25 million BTC for $60,000 per BTC with the fund, far above the maximum supply cap of 21 million BTC. The proposal calls for a regulatory overhaul to make XRP payment network Unsurprisingly, the ambitious proposal also contained recommendations necessary for integrating XRP into the US financial system. The first recommendation is an executive order from the President directing the SEC, the Treasury, and the Department of Justice (DOJ) to classify XRP as a payment asset. The administration believes that this order will resolve the pending lawsuit against Ripple regarding the status of the SEC. Beyond the executive order, the multiphase plan includes other recommendations calling for legislation that will mandate banks to adopt XRP and require the Federal Reserve and Office of the Comptroller of Currency to make using XRP compulsory for banks as a replacement for Nostro. The proposal emphasized the SEC and Ripple lawsuit, noting that legal clarity is needed. It noted that implementation could happen within 12 to 24 months, depending on whether the stakeholders follow the regular or accelerated plan. Crypto community reacts Meanwhile, the proposal has attracted criticism from many in the crypto community, who consider it a completely unrealistic plan that should be ignored. Bitcoin Magazine political correspondent Frank Corva described it as illogical in an opinion piece. Corva wrote: “Given how faulty the logic behind this proposal is, it’s difficult to consider XRP a strategic asset. Plus, why would the U.S. government do so when two thirds of the supply is still in the hands of the organization that issued the asset?” Although the proposal’s appearance on the SEC website has generated publicity, some users have clarified that the regulator allows individuals to submit proposals and public comments, which it publishes on its website. Thus, this is not the SEC’s official position. Staudinger himself has confirmed this, noting that he wrote it to show the potential of XRP. Cryptopolitan Academy: Want to grow your money in 2025?

According to Lookonchain data, CZ purchased one BNB each of two memecoins, Mubarak and Test (TST), via a decentralized exchange (DEX). CZ has been posting a lot of posts recently promoting the development of memecoins on the Binance Smart Chain (BSC) network, and the recent purchases are likely made with this in mind. The memecoin called Mubarak was recently launched and has climbed to a significant level of $66 million in market value. The token’s price has increased by 69% in the last 24 hours.

Here’s Why,https://timestabloid.com/bitcoin-shorts-face-1-5-billion-liquidation-risk-heres-why/,"Bitcoin’s relentless rally has put bearish traders in a precarious position, with $1.5 billion in short positions at risk of liquidation if BTC reclaims the $90,000 level. As bullish momentum continues to build, market dynamics suggest that a short squeeze could trigger even more upside volatility, pushing Bitcoin into uncharted territory. With liquidity imbalances growing and institutional demand surging, the next move for Bitcoin could have far-reaching implications for traders and the broader cryptocurrency market. Short positions in Bitcoin represent leveraged bets against the price, with traders borrowing BTC to sell at current levels in hopes of buying back at a lower price for a profit. However, if Bitcoin’s price moves against them, these traders must either add collateral to maintain their positions or face forced liquidations, where their holdings are automatically closed to prevent further losses. ALERT: $1.5 BILLION worth of #Bitcoin shorts face liquidation if $BTC reclaims $90,000. pic.twitter.com/6RmwxCGw9S — Cointelegraph (@Cointelegraph) March 13, 2025 At $90,000, a critical threshold has been identified where a significant number of short positions will be wiped out. If Bitcoin’s price reaches this level, the forced liquidation of these positions would lead to a cascade of buy orders, fueling a short squeeze—a rapid upward price movement as sellers are forced to buy back BTC to cover their losses. This liquidation event could further intensify Bitcoin’s rally, potentially sending it to new all-time highs as traders scramble to exit their losing positions. Bitcoin’s Bullish Momentum and Institutional Demand Bitcoin’s upward trajectory has been largely fueled by institutional accumulation, growing spot ETF inflows, and increasing confidence in its long-term value proposition. As traditional finance continues to integrate Bitcoin into investment portfolios, liquidity is tightening, leaving short sellers vulnerable to sudden price surges. The demand for Bitcoin is also being amplified by macro factors, including central bank monetary policies, and the growing recognition of Bitcoin as a hedge against inflation. These conditions create an environment where Bitcoin’s supply shock—exacerbated by the upcoming 2025 halving—could push prices even higher, further squeezing short positions. Short Squeeze Potential: How High Could Bitcoin Go? If Bitcoin reclaims $90,000 and triggers a wave of liquidations, market conditions could rapidly shift in favor of bulls. Short squeezes historically result in explosive upward moves, as seen during previous bull cycles when cascading liquidations accelerated price gains. In 2021, a similar liquidation event contributed to Bitcoin’s rapid ascent past $60,000, and in 2019, a short squeeze propelled BTC from $7,000 to over $10,000 within days. Given Bitcoin’s current liquidity structure and leverage ratios, a break above $90,000 could see BTC surge toward $95,000 or even $100,000 in a short period. Additionally, as Bitcoin’s dominance in the crypto market strengthens, its movements will likely influence broader market trends, impacting altcoins, leverage ratios, and overall market sentiment. A successful breach of $90,000 would not only force shorts out of the market but could also trigger renewed retail FOMO, adding further fuel to the rally. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Market Uncertainty: Risks and Potential Reversals While Bitcoin’s bullish setup suggests a high probability of a short squeeze, market volatility remains a key factor. Resistance at $90,000 may lead to temporary pullbacks, with large players attempting to manipulate price action to shake out overleveraged long positions before another leg up. Additionally, macroeconomic factors such as regulatory developments, central bank interest rate decisions, or unexpected market shocks could introduce temporary downside risks. However, as long as Bitcoin maintains strong institutional support and growing adoption, any corrections may present buying opportunities rather than trend reversals. The Road to $90,000 and Beyond Bitcoin’s approach to the $90,000 mark is shaping up to be one of the most crucial price battles in recent history. With $1.5 billion in shorts on the line, the market is poised for heightened volatility, and the potential for a massive short squeeze could send Bitcoin to unprecedented levels. As liquidity conditions tighten and demand continues to rise, Bitcoin’s next move could set the stage for the final leg of this bull cycle, with $100,000 becoming an increasingly realistic target. Whether shorts can hold the line or are forced into liquidation remains to be seen, but one thing is certain—Bitcoin’s next price move will be a defining moment for the market.

Experts say Solana price a raft of on-chain data will affect Solana’s price including bridged assets and positive SMA and EMA indicators. Solana Receives $315 Million Assets Bridged From Ethereum Solana’s ecosystem is buzzing with optimism following a surge in the volume of bridged assets to the network. According to the latest data , Solana received $314 million worth of tokens from the Ethereum network in the last 30 days. The metric is a record high for Solana with the volume dwarfing the total bridged assets to Ethereum’s layer 2 projects. According to on-chain data, the value received by Solana from Ethereum is 463% more than the volume transferred to ETH’s layer 2 platforms. Pundits say the spike in bridged assets over the last 30 days is a bullish indicator for Solana’s price. Right out of the bat, the assets will increase the total value locked (TVL) and liquidity for SOL while increasing user activity. Others are construing the metric as confirmation of Solana’s dominance over Ethereum , stirring anticipation of a potential flippening. Solana Price Eyes $178 In The Short-Term There is increased investor confidence that Solana price can clinch $178 in the short term. On-analysts say if SOL breaks through its 20-day exponential moving average (EMA), investors can expect the easing of current selling pressure. The easing will fuel a push toward the 50-day simple moving average (SMA) that will see the price face bearish resistance at around $178. However, a price break below $120 could trigger a steeper correction toward $110 and a potential $90. In the long term, a forming cup-and-handle pattern could send SOL to $3,800 if a break out occurs. Currently, Solana is trading at $129, down by nearly 4% over the last 24 hours. The network is agog with a slew of activity as Solana marks its fifth anniversary. The failure of the SIMD-0228 proposal still offers a silver lining for Solana given the speed of voting processes.

In an update , Bubblemaps, a blockchain analytics firm, highlighted how Davis tried to conceal the move from the authorities. Ties to Jordan Belfort and WallStreetBets Promotions Bubblemaps, working in collaboration with Coffeezilla, a renowned crypto scam investigator, identified Davis as the creator behind LIBRA and MELANIA . The duo noticed fund transfers in their investigation, which proved that Davis created WOLF. On the surface, the token has been associated with Jordan Belfort , a notable stockbroker who inspired the famous Hollywood film, “The Wolf of Wall Street.” Notably, there were rumors that Belfort would launch a token in the crypto market. Interestingly, while WOLF tokens flooded the market, one stood out. A WallStreetBets promoted WOLF token had its developer buy large amounts very early, using multiple wallets. The developer orchestrated a rug pull as soon as it reached a market capitalization of $40 million. That is, pulled liquidity, leaving investors holding worthless tokens. Bubblemaps Exposes Davis’ Hidden Role Blockchain analysis highlighted the obvious giveaway sign that it was a fraudulent token launch. A staggering 82% of the token supply was controlled in a single bundle. This implies that a few wallets had most of it, which is a typical scam move. According to Bubblemaps, on-chain data revealed that the WOLF token followed HOOD’s transaction pattern. The token HOOD has also been linked to Davis. Interestingly, a trace done on 17 wallet addresses and five cross-chain transfers associated the WOLF token’s creator, 6MsuHd, with a single address, 0xcEAe. Not surprisingly, this address belongs to Hayden Davis. Interpol Hunt Continues For LIBRA Founder Davis and his activities have been investigated after his involvement with LIBRA memecoin. The scale of the deception was so huge that Javier Milei, Argentina’s president, endorsed the token. This caused a remarkable but brief surge in LIBRA’s market capitalization to over $4.5 billion . However, not long after, LIBRA suffered a collapse, and its value plummeted to about $18 million. This represents an over 99% decline in value.

Here’s The Implication,https://timestabloid.com/michael-saylor-eyes-21-billion-bitcoin-purchase-heres-the-implication/,"Michael Saylor, the executive chairman of MicroStrategy and one of Bitcoin’s most vocal advocates, is reportedly preparing to purchase $21 billion worth of Bitcoin , a move that could have profound implications for the cryptocurrency market. According to Ash Crypto, if Saylor executes this purchase at $84,000 per BTC, it would add approximately 250,000 BTC to MicroStrategy’s already massive holdings. This potential acquisition is unprecedented, as it would exceed the total Bitcoin mined in one and a half years. Given Bitcoin’s current issuance rate of approximately 164,000 BTC per year, Saylor’s planned purchase would significantly tighten available supply, further fueling Bitcoin’s scarcity-driven value proposition. MICHAEL SAYLOR PLANS TO PURCHASE $21 BILLION WORTH OF BITCOIN. IF HE BUYS AT $84,000 BTC, THIS WOULD ADD APPROXIMATELY 250,000 BTC AROUND 164,000 BITCOIN MINED ANNUALLY. THIS MEANS HE IS BUYING 1.5 YEARS' WORTH OF NEW BITCOIN ISSUANCE. THIS WILL BE THE LAST TIME WE CAN SEE… pic.twitter.com/oMXGt1QhYd — Ash Crypto (@Ashcryptoreal) March 16, 2025 MicroStrategy’s Bitcoin Strategy Since adopting Bitcoin as its primary treasury reserve asset in 2020, MicroStrategy has relentlessly accumulated BTC , positioning itself as the largest corporate holder of the asset. Saylor has consistently emphasized Bitcoin’s superiority over traditional fiat currencies and other store-of-value assets, arguing that Bitcoin is the ultimate hedge against inflation and economic instability. If MicroStrategy proceeds with this massive purchase, its Bitcoin holdings will likely surpass 500,000 BTC, further solidifying its position as one of the most influential entities in the Bitcoin ecosystem. This level of accumulation represents not only a corporate bet on Bitcoin’s long-term viability but also a strategic move that could impact liquidity, institutional sentiment, and market dynamics. What Happens When Bitcoin Becomes Scarcer? Bitcoin’s supply dynamics are well understood, with a hard cap of 21 million BTC and a programmed issuance schedule that reduces the number of new coins entering circulation every four years through the halving. The next Bitcoin halving, expected in April 2025, will further cut block rewards from 6.25 BTC to 3.125 BTC per block, reducing the annual issuance to just 82,000 BTC. Saylor’s planned purchase would absorb more than 1.5 years’ worth of new Bitcoin issuance, effectively accelerating Bitcoin’s scarcity timeline. This move could push Bitcoin’s price significantly higher, as it would intensify competition for available BTC, driving demand among both retail and institutional investors. If history is any indicator, past supply shocks have resulted in exponential price surges, particularly when demand outpaces new supply. With institutional adoption growing and spot Bitcoin ETFs now providing mainstream investors with easier access to BTC, Saylor’s move could set the stage for another parabolic rally. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Institutional Adoption and the Role of MicroStrategy MicroStrategy’s aggressive Bitcoin strategy has already inspired other corporations, hedge funds, and institutional investors to consider BTC as a treasury asset. With Saylor planning to acquire an additional 250,000 BTC, this could serve as a catalyst for more institutional players to enter the market, fearing that future Bitcoin acquisitions will become increasingly difficult. Beyond direct corporate adoption, Saylor’s actions could also influence regulatory discussions surrounding Bitcoin’s role in global finance. As more institutions accumulate BTC, the narrative around Bitcoin as a legitimate asset class gains further validation, making it harder for governments or regulators to ignore its significance. Bitcoin’s Next Milestone If Saylor’s plan materializes, the market could witness a rapid repricing of Bitcoin, potentially pushing it toward the $100,000 milestone . The combination of institutional accumulation, supply constraints, and increasing mainstream adoption creates a perfect storm for Bitcoin’s value to appreciate significantly. Moreover, as MicroStrategy’s holdings cross 500,000 BTC, it raises an important question—will this be the last opportunity for major players to accumulate Bitcoin at current levels before the supply crunch intensifies? With Ash Crypto’s report shedding light on Saylor’s ambitious plans, the crypto market is now closely watching for confirmation. If this purchase comes to fruition, it will mark a historic moment in Bitcoin’s evolution, further cementing its status as the most sought-after digital asset in the world.

An Argentinian prosecutor has filed a request with a judge to issue an Interpol “Red Notice” – or an international arrest warrant – for Davis because of his involvement with Argentinian president Javier Milei-inspired LIBRA and US First Lady Melania Trump-backed MELANIA , Forbes reports . Hayden admitted to backing the launch of LIBRA and, according to on-chain analysts, was also involved in launching MELANIA – both of which crashed mere hours after launch and are down 92% and 94% from their highs, respectively. Says prosecutor Gregorio Dalbón, “I’m here to request the immediate detention of Hayden Mark Davis, a citizen of the United States, who is accused of being one of the principal actors behind the launch of the cryptocurrency LIBRA… The possibility that Davis will abandon his country of residence or hide to avoid answering for his alleged acts appears to be aggravated by the economic resources he possesses, which he can use to move or remain in hiding, hindering our investigation.” President Milei quickly disavowed LIBRA, claiming that he was essentially deceived into backing its launch. Said Milei in Spanish, “ I was not aware of the details of the project and after having become aware of it I decided not to continue spreading the word (that is why I deleted the tweet). To the filthy rats of the political caste who want to take advantage of this situation to do harm, I want to say that every day they confirm how vile politicians are, and they increase our conviction to kick them in the a**.” Forbes says that Davis, his brother Gideon and his father Charles didn’t respond to a request for comments.

Whales are accumulating, with a rise in USDT holdings indicating fresh capital is entering the market. Meanwhile, a rise in Bitcoin supply on exchanges signals caution. The Bitcoin market is sending mixed signals, leaving investors wondering whether to expect a rebound or further decline. On the Thinking Crypto podcast , Tony Edward and Brian Quinlivan from Santiment recently discussed the current, complex landscape. Bullish Signs: Whale Accumulation and Stablecoin Inflows While Quinlivan acknowledged that the past few months have been challenging for Bitcoin and altcoins, he noted the last couple of days have shown signs of optimism. However, with sentiment shifting back toward bullishness, there is a risk of a bull trap, where prices may stagnate or even dip before finding more stability. Quinlivan advised market participants to exercise caution to avoid getting it wrong while whales and sharks drive the market’s true direction.

This article dives into the digital assets primed for significant gains. Discover which cryptocurrencies show the most promise and why they could be the next big thing in the market. Stay ahead of the curve and uncover potential profit opportunities. Ethereum Price Trends and Key Level Outlook Ethereum declined by almost 28% over the past month with a weekly drop of about 12%. The six-month performance shows a reduction of 16% from earlier highs. The price history reflects sustained bearish pressure with no sharp reversals over this period. This ongoing selling trend has created a challenging environment for investors, leading to a cautious market outlook for traders. The current trading range sits between roughly $1766 and $3021, with strong support near $1294 and resistance around $3804. Negative momentum, highlighted by an oscillator reading of -461, indicates bearish control, while the RSI of 35 suggests oversold conditions. Traders might consider buying near support and selling close to resistance, with a break above $3804 potentially signaling bullish strength. Shiba Inu: Price Movements and Key Levels Shiba Inu shows a one-month decline of about 20.83% with a six-month dip of roughly 1.97%. A weekly gain of 2.13% hints at brief recoveries amid the overall downward trend. Price volatility has led to mixed performance, with sharper monthly drops contrasting against relatively stable half-year figures. This indicates a period of correction and uncertainty. The current price lies between $0.0000106 and $0.0000182. A key resistance at $0.0000226 and a secondary barrier at $0.0000302 sit above a support level of $0.00000728. Bears hold more influence as momentum indicators edge lower, resulting in a sideways range. Traders might explore cautious long entries near support or short-term plays on small rebounds with tight controls. SOL Price Movement Reflects Mixed Market Signals Solana experienced a 30.51% drop over the past month and a 2.81% gain over the last six months. The price fluctuated within a range from 104 to 213 dollars, showing significant volatility recently while maintaining modest strength over the half-year period. This behavior highlights a trend of rapid adjustments despite overall sideways movement in recent times. Current price sits between $104 and $213 with resistance at $277.85 and a second barrier near $386.39, while support is seen at 60.77. Bears currently dominate with negative momentum and a low oscillation reading, yet the RSI at 42.98 suggests potential trading opportunities. Buyers may consider positions near support, while sellers could look to target resistance for strategic entry points. Conclusion The market is preparing for a major recovery with key altcoins in focus. Ethereum (ETH) remains a strong contender due to its widespread use and upcoming upgrades. Shiba Inu (SHIB) continues to draw interest for its community-driven approach. Solana (SOL) attracts attention with its performance improvements and growing ecosystem. Keeping an eye on these coins may provide opportunities as the market gains momentum. Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

As digital assets gain widespread adoption, top rated crypto projects like Qubetics, while Monero, and Polkadot are leading the charge, each addressing unique market needs. From real-world asset tokenization to privacy-focused transactions and blockchain interoperability, these projects have redefined what cryptocurrencies can offer beyond conventional digital payments. Among them, Qubetics has captured attention with its successful presale and groundbreaking approach to real-world asset tokenization. Monero remains the foremost privacy-centric cryptocurrency, ensuring complete anonymity for transactions. Meanwhile, Polkadot continues to revolutionize blockchain connectivity by enabling seamless communication between networks. Whether security, scalability, or innovative investment opportunities are the priority, these three crypto projects are at the forefront of blockchain development. Qubetics: Pioneering Real-World Asset Tokenization As the world’s first Web3 aggregator, Qubetics is revolutionizing the industry by bridging the gap between real-world assets and blockchain technology. Its real-world asset tokenization Marketplace enables businesses, professionals, and individuals to tokenize tangible assets, enhancing accessibility, security, and efficiency. For example, a real estate developer can digitize property ownership through blockchain, allowing fractional purchases, increased liquidity, and broader market access. Similarly, independent artists can tokenize their work, securing authenticity and enabling transparent revenue generation. The Qubetics crypto presale has experienced exceptional growth, reaching the 25th stage with each $TICS token priced at $0.1074. The project has raised over $15 million, surpassing 499 million $TICS tokens sold and attracting more than 23,000 token holders. Market analysts forecast significant potential for $TICS, with projections suggesting a post-presale value $15, translating into up to 13,860% ROI. The increasing demand for Qubetics reflects the growing confidence in its innovative approach, further solidifying its position as a top rated crypto with long-term growth potential. TICSScan: Bringing Transparency to Tokenized Assets To further strengthen its tokenization framework, Qubetics has introduced TICSScan, a revolutionary tool designed for verifying and tracking digital assets on the blockchain. Users can monitor transactions, confirm ownership, and ensure regulatory compliance—all within a decentralized, trustless environment. This advanced feature enhances the credibility of tokenized assets and simplifies historically complex verification processes, making asset ownership more transparent. Monero: Championing Privacy in the Crypto World Among privacy-focused cryptocurrencies, Monero (XMR) has maintained its dominance by ensuring untraceable transactions through cutting-edge cryptographic techniques. Utilizing ring signatures and stealth addresses, Monero guarantees that transaction details remain private, making it a preferred choice for users prioritizing confidentiality. Despite regulatory scrutiny surrounding privacy coins, Monero has remained resilient, demonstrating stable market performance and continued adoption. Its commitment to decentralization and security makes it one of the most trusted top rated crypto projects in the digital asset space. As decentralized finance (DeFi) grows, Monero’s focus on untraceable transactions continues to attract those concerned about financial privacy. This steadfast commitment to anonymity ensures its relevance in an expanding regulatory market. Polkadot: Facilitating Blockchain Interoperability One of the most pressing challenges in blockchain technology is fragmentation—the inability of different networks to communicate efficiently. Polkadot (DOT) addresses this issue by enabling seamless interoperability between blockchains, allowing them to share data and execute transactions across multiple ecosystems. By fostering a more connected and scalable infrastructure, Polkadot has positioned itself as a top rated crypto, attracting numerous projects to build on its framework. In 2024, Polkadot introduced version 2.0, implementing multiple upgrades to improve network performance and scalability. These advancements have further strengthened its position as a leading blockchain solution. Conclusion Can cryptocurrency provide a sustainable alternative to traditional financial systems? The continued success of crypto projects like Qubetics, Monero, and Polkadot suggests that blockchain-based investments are becoming increasingly viable. Qubetics stands out with its real-world asset tokenization model, offering innovative financial solutions through blockchain technology. Monero remains a dominant force in privacy-focused transactions, ensuring security and anonymity. Meanwhile, Polkadot is redefining how blockchains interact, enabling a more interconnected digital ecosystem. Before engaging with any cryptocurrency, careful research and risk assessment are essential. However, the distinct strengths of Qubetics, Monero, and Polkadot highlight the transformative potential of top rated crypto projects, reinforcing their growing significance as alternative investment opportunities.

MUTM has already raised $3.4 million and has 5,700 holders, and is currently available for $0.02 in its 3rd presale round. With Phase 3 close to full, and with a price increase to $0.025 imminent, early purchasers can secure a 25% profit before the stage closes. Analysts emphasise the uniqueness of the tokenomics of MUTM, which secure an automatic 200% return when it lists at $0.06 on an exchange, with forecasts for after the launch reaching as high as $3.50 — a possible 17,400% increase on the current price. Tron (TRX): Vanishing Faith in Legacy Networks Tron (TRX), once hailed as the high-throughput blockchain, is struggling with low investor interest. The market dominance it once enjoyed has been diminished by regulatory scrutiny, market saturation, and the need for stakeholders to move to platforms with true utility. Although TRX still enjoys a loyal following, it’s failure to innovate upon transactional speed has relegated it to the background behind emerging DeFi platforms. Network upgrades haven’t sparked a revival, with trading volumes drying up as capital flees to ecosystems that combine lending, borrowing and yield-generating activity. Shiba Inu (SHIB): Meme Coin Fatigue Begins Skeptics are increasingly growing for Shiba Inu (SHIB), the dog-themed token that sparked retail traders’ interest during the bull run of 2021. However, futures’ volatility and lack of real-world application have shown it to be reliant on hype, leading institutional players to leave speculative assets. This exodus is highlighted by SHIB’s 30% drop over the past quarter, as investors flee to projects with structured revenue models. While Mutuum Finance (MUTM) integrates buy pressure mechanics + passive income streams, positively progressive features — SHIB has little to offer beyond momentum, elucidatively driven by the community; a vulnerability — as market players /brokers become more strategically incentivized. Mutuum Finance (MUTM): Building Sustainable Demand Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is unique in its self-reinforcing ecosystem for sustainable growth. Through its decentralized lending platform, users can deposit assets including ETH or stablecoins, receiving interest-earning mtTokens that increase in value over time. Lenders secure their position by providing overcollateralized loans to borrowers, reducing the risk of default. A “peer to peer” functionality takes this a step further, allowing direct negotiation for niche assets such as meme coins, and is a million miles away from SHIB’s one-dimensional attraction. Platform fee income powers a buy-and-distribute program that continuously buys MUTM tokens from the market place and distributes them to stakers. This ensures quasi-constant demand, shielding the token from volatility and rewarding commitment over time. Phase 3 investors currently enter at $0.02, paving the way for 200% profit at launch and exponential potential going forward. Emphasis on Security and Scalability The smart contracts of Mutuum Finance are covered by increasing audits through Certik, which will enhance investor confidence more once completed. There will be transparent updates following this across official communication channels — signalling the project’s commitment to security. Together with a plan for an overcollateralized stablecoin, these moves help secure MUTM’s status as a DeFi innovator and not just another fad. Amidst the existential crises facing Tron (TRX) and Shiba Inu (SHIB), Mutuum Finance (MUTM) shines as a strategic capital magnet. Phase 3 is filling up fast, and now that the price target has reached $3.50, the chance to secure tokens for $0.02 is closing fast. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) welcomes early participants to seize the opportunity and the most significant benefit from the unique platform as its launch within the decentralized finance market fast approaches.

Although XRP has managed to push up in the past five days after reaching a low of $1.93 on March 11, it has yet to fully recoup its losses in the first week of the month. Related Reading: 200 Million XRP On The Move—Is Ripple Preparing For A Big Play? The altcoin’s long-term prospects are still on bullish speculation, but its short-term price action has frustrated traders looking for signs of a breakout. Amid this stagnation, crypto analyst Egrag Crypto has outlined specific price levels that could determine whether XRP finally reverses its course. Analyst Identifies $2.65 As Key Level Before XRP Can Challenge $3.00 Egrag Crypto, a long-time bullish advocate for XRP, recently took to social media platform X to outline key price levels that could determine the cryptocurrency’s next significant move. He identified $2.65 as the first critical threshold the coin must reclaim to sustain meaningful bullish momentum. However, the analyst expressed concern over XRP’s repeated tests of lower boundaries, which is in reference to the recent bottom at $1.93. According to the analyst, the frequent retests of this support level are a double-edged sword. While multiple touches on resistance can eventually trigger a breakout, repeated tests of support weaken its integrity, increasing the likelihood of a breakdown. He likened this pattern to knocking on a door that would eventually open or break. He highlighted six instances of XRP retesting this zone since December 2024 on a 12-hour candlestick chart, warning that prolonged weakness could pave the way for further downside. For the crypto to escape this cycle and shift into bullish territory, Egrag emphasized the importance of a strong close above $3.00, not just a brief move past it. This level has served as the upper resistance trendline for the past two weeks and has been a barrier to any sustained uptrend. Failure to break and hold above $3.00 could cause continued correction in the short term and keep XRP trapped in its current range. However, the analyst believes XRP’s chances of reaching $3.00, considering the current price action, are slim without securing a close above $2.65. Image From X: EGRAG CRYPTO What’s Next For XRP After $3? March has been particularly bearish for XRP, with sellers maintaining control as it failed to reclaim lost ground. However, if XRP bulls manage to close above $3 before the end of the month, it will open up the door for the resumption of a price rally.

While studying at Saint Petersburg State University, Durov became inspired by the success of the Facebook social media site and its founder, Mark Zuckerberg — eventually starting the social media platform VKontakte (VK) in 2006. VK is a platform similar to Facebook but geared toward Russian speakers, and it is one of the largest social media platforms in the world. A picture of Pavel Durov as a teenager. Source: Cointelegraph The meteoric growth of the platform eventually attracted the attention of state regulators, who pressured the company to censor the platform and comply with government requests to provide user information. Durov refused to comply with these requests out of a principled stance on freedom of speech, online expression, and user privacy, which caused the tech founder to be ousted from the company he started in 2014. However, the tech founder was already hard at work on his next venture before departing VK, a messaging platform that has become a household name in crypto — Telegram.

Since then, the platform has garnered over 950 million users worldwide due to its privacy-enhancing technology, which encrypts messages end to end. Telegram also has robust features that include decentralized web surfing, a torrent of mini-apps and games. The platform also has a symbiotic relationship with The Open Network (TON) — a separate blockchain network that has become a staple for users of the messaging application.

Source: TechCrunch According to Forbes , the Telegram founder has a net worth of $17.1 billion as of March 16, 2025 — mainly through his ownership of Telegram. In March 2024, the entrepreneur announced that Telegram was nearing profitability and was considering an initial public offering to become a publicly traded company. Pavel Durov is known for advocating individual freedoms, which is reflected in Telegram’s approach. In a January 2025 post, Durov wrote : ""I am proud that Telegram has supported freedom of speech long before it became politically safe to do so. Our values don’t depend on US electoral cycles."" The Telegram founder’s libertarian ethos, commitment to free speech, and privacy eventually put the entrepreneur in the crosshairs of the French government. Pavel Durov arrested in France amid cries of politically-motivated censorship Pavel Durov was arrested in France on Aug. 24, 2024, due to a lack of content moderation on Telegram, and subsequently charged by French prosecutors with complicity with illegal activities and refusal to communicate with authorities. Durov speaks with independent news host Tucker Carlson about free speech and privacy shortly before his arrest in August 2024. Source: Tucker Carlson Shortly after his arrest, the Telegram founder posted bail and was released from custody on the condition that he remain in France during the legal proceedings. The arrest drew strong reactions from the crypto community and free speech advocates worldwide, who criticized the French government for its actions, expressing concerns about potential pressure on Pavel Durov to modify Telegram’s policies or provide access to its encryption keys. French President Emmanuel Macron was accused of orchestrating a politically motivated arrest, a claim the French leader denied , which only prompted more backlash from the crypto community. On March 15, Pavel Durov reportedly left France and headed to Dubai, where Telegram is headquartered, after receiving permission from French law enforcement officials to leave the country. However, it is unclear how long Durov will remain in Dubai as the global fight for freedom of speech, privacy, and autonomy continues. Magazine: Did Telegram’s Pavel Durov commit a crime?

The coin has managed an average price of between $82,000 and $83,000 in the cryptocurrency market. Josh Mandell’s Bold Forecast on BTC Despite the price fluctuation, Josh Mandell , a crypto millionaire and analyst, has made a bold prediction. Mandell has opined the possible price expectation within the next 15 days, projecting a rebound to the psychological $100,000 by the end of March. According to Mandell, performance is a critical factor that could determine the price trajectory of BTC and its rally. He identifies $84,000 as a key level and the coin’s ability to stabilize at range as a critical launchpad for future gains. “If it closes at 84K exactly, we run the table … HISTORIC moves,” Mandell wrote. This means a massive historic rally would likely occur if BTC stabilized at $84,000. However, the crypto millionaire noted that if the price of BTC closes way above $84,000, this could trigger a pullback in the market. Such a scenario might cause the anticipated rally to fail. This suggests that exceeding the critical mark too quickly could trigger a technical reversal . It might also lead to exhaustion and profit-taking among market participants, causing a slip. Market Uncertainty and Diverging Views Notably, due to the volatility in the crypto market and other liquidity dynamics, analysts maintain that these factors could result in different price actions for the leading digital asset. Some market participants have expressed optimism that, given the market signals, a rally could begin this week with the prediction of it retesting its ATH by June . However, others have called for patience, noting that the broader financial market dynamics could impact projections. Market observers believe a major shock to the crypto and financial space could help ignite a price shift and awaken Bitcoin from its stagnation. Bitcoin’s Current Position and Outlook As of this writing, Bitcoin traded at $84,296.40, representing a 0.03% increase in the last 24 hours. The coin had climbed from a low of $82,393.57 to a high of $85,051.60 before settling at the current price. Investors, however, have not rekindled their enthusiasm for the coin as trading volume has dipped by a significant 14.65% to $15.95 billion within the same time frame.

According to Aave Labs’ CEO, the DAO is not currently looking to invest in tokens other than AAVE. The unanimous decision came via a consensus among members of the DAO. A decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) runs on “decentralized” authority, such that decisions are usually never made by one person. More details about the consensus Aave Labs’ CEO, Stani Kulechov announced that the consensus will be respected, as Aave DAO operates a DAO not just in name only. According to Stani, this means the team won’t try to push any agenda other than the DAO’s decision. Aave Labs’ CEO, Stani Kulechov shares a message with the AAVE DAO after they reached a consensus about token investment. Source: Stani Kulechov (X/Twitter) As for its pledge to take RWA exploration more seriously, Stanis’ post assures it will continue, but only once they find the right approach. “There is only $AAVE,” he wrote as he ended his post. The DAO’s decision to circle back and return to the whiteboard regarding RWA exploration is not only a smart one but also proof of Aave DAO’s strategic (or cautious) interest in the budding crypto sector. Focusing on AAVE alone also means the Aave DAO doesn’t have to manage the risks that come with portfolio diversification. Under the comment section of Stani’s post announcing the consensus and the team’s plan to honor it, interested parties weighed in with their opinions. While many praised the DAO’s decision to focus on only Aave, there was a smattering of more critical comments. One of them wondered why the RWA exploration was being put on a back burner and also pointed out that adding value to the AAVEe token should not be something they are just agreeing on. Another user stated that it made no sense to create another token and implied that “extracting value from Aave” would be the ultimate accomplishment. Overall, the community agrees with the consensus and is glad RWA exploration is still on the table, even if it is not a priority right now. The news comes shortly after Aave Labs announced the launch of Horizon One reason many may have been surprised that RWA exploration is currently not the priority of the DAO is that only days before, Aave Labs launched a new initiative named Horizon, and its purpose is to enhance the integration of institutional real-world assets (RWAs) into DeFi. Aave made the announcement on March 13, and according to reports, the project aims to bridge DeFi’s open financial ecosystem with the structured needs of institutional asset issuers, thereby creating infrastructure that encourages broader participation in on-chain finance. Project Horizon will align with institutional compliance requirements while staying true to DeFi’s efficiency and transparency. It essentially introduces a structured pathway for institutions and tokenization platforms to leverage decentralized finance without concern. One of Horizon’s core features is that it will allow institutions to use tokenized money market funds (MMFs) as collateral when borrowing stablecoins. It also has future plans to expand to other forms of RWAs and enhance institutional access to DeFi liquidity. Aave Labs’ CEO, Stani Kulechov, in the past, has pointed out that DeFi lacks the necessary infrastructure to handle large-scale institutional participation even though that is the end game. Two-year chart of tokenized US Treasuries. Source: RWA.xyz According to him, Project Horizon, wise from lessons from Aave Arc, is capable of improving institutional access to permissionless stablecoin liquidity. To back the initiative, Aave has proposed launching a licensed instance of the Aave Protocol via the Aave DAO and it will be the foundation for all projects under the Horizon initiative. Horizon’s RWA solution will start out as an operation under Aave V3 as a licensed instance but will eventually transition to a custom Aave V4 deployment when available. Horizon will also implement a profit-sharing mechanism for long-term sustainability, allocating 50% of its first-year revenue to the Aave DAO. Additional incentives will also be introduced to encourage broader ecosystem adoption. Aave Labs’ interest in RWAs is happening amid significant growth in the sector. According to RWA.xyz , the total value of on-chain RWAs has increased by more than 17% over the past month, reaching $18.13 billion. The number of unique asset holders has also surged by 5%, surpassing 89,818. One critical expansion area has been on-chain treasuries, which now account for a TVL of $4.22 billion, reflecting a 400% year-over-year increase. Despite all that growth, experts still see a lot of potential in RWAs. Many predict the RWA sector could scale to $16 trillion over the next decade, which highlights its growing presence in global finance. The trend has been spotted by major institutions like BlackRock, who have already issued substantial tokenized assets through its BUIDL product. Other institutions like BlackRock that have shown significant interest in the RWA sector include JPMorgan, Citigroup, UBS, Franklin Templeton and Goldman Sachs. These organizations are doing it for their own respective reasons. JPMorgan, for instance, has pioneered RWA tokenization through its Onyx platform and has processed over $900 billion in tokenized assets, while Franklin Templeton is embracing RWAs by launching tokenized money market funds and exploring blockchain-based asset management.

One of those included establishing a strategic Bitcoin reserve. Earlier this month, he kept his word and signed an executive order to create such an initiative. He also ordered the formation of a Digital Asset Stockpile. The strategic Bitcoin reserve is designed to hold BTC as a reserve asset and will be comprised of holdings acquired through criminal or civil asset forfeiture proceedings. The US Digital Asset Stockpile will serve the same purpose and consist of altcoins obtained through similar seizure efforts. Reactions From the Community The development became the talk of the town, and many industry leaders gave their two cents. One of them, Arthur Beitman, co-founder of the blockchain platform Tezos, recently told CryptoPotato that the strategic reserve is “an interesting concept” but suggested that only time will tell whether it will succeed. “Usually strategic reserves are meant to match potential liabilities, e.g. oil. Foreign reserves play the dual role of matching potential liabilities from international trade and helping stabilize the domestic currency. But perhaps it’s meant as reparations from the government to the industry for past lawfare? Who knows,” he added. Alex Shevchenko – CEO and co-founder of Aurora – said establishing a BTC reserve is a “turning point, ” marking the recognition of the primary cryptocurrency as “a strategic financial instrument, not just by some businesses but by governments themselves.” “US is positioning itself ahead of the curve. Other nations will have no choice but to respond. I believe we’re going to see many countries follow US innovation at this point. This isn’t just about the US leading in crypto , it’s about Bitcoin becoming a core asset in geopolitical finance,” the exec stated. Additional Opinions Other well-known people who weighed in on the initiative include Anthony Scaramucci and Michael Saylor. The former White House official said he believes in the BTC reserve “not because it will help Bitcoin, but because it will help the United States.” It is important to note that Scaramucci was part of the US government during Trump’s first presidency. He was once a firm proponent of the Republican , but in 2019, he withdrew that support, citing concerns over the president’s behavior and rhetoric. For his part, Strategy’s Executive Chairman described the creation of a strategic BTC reserve in America as a historical moment and “a turning point in the financial and geopolitical landscape of the 21st century.” Despite the overall positivism, the ultimate crypto bear, Peter Schiff, will always find a way to criticize a major crypto development. Not long ago, the economist known for his affection toward gold claimed that political and financial interests drove the decision. “Under pressure from his donors and conflicted cabinet members, Trump just signed a bogus executive order to create a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve using the Bitcoin the government already owns,” he maintained.

Kevin O’Leary champions Trump’s vision, but skeptics remain",https://crypto.news/cryptos-new-era-kevin-oleary-champions-trumps-vision-but-skeptics-remain/,"As President Donald Trump stakes his claim on the future of cryptocurrency in America, investors and industry insiders are divided on whether his administration truly marks a turning point for digital assets. Kevin O’Leary, chairman of O’Leary Ventures and a longtime cryptocurrency advocate, recently lauded Trump’s stance on digital assets, arguing that this administration is ushering in a “new phase” for the industry. Speaking on “My View with Lara Trump,” O’Leary asserted that the so-called “cowboy era of crypto” — marked by high-profile fraud cases and regulatory uncertainty — was over. Recall that O’Leary was indeed affected by perhaps the biggest crypto fraud case of all — FTX . As an investor and spokesperson for the exchange, O’Leary lost a significant amount of money when Sam Bankman-Fried’s startup went bankrupt in late 2022. “All the crypto cowboys are in jail or out of business. So now we’re in a new phase. There’s a new tone with the government. Trump has put it forward,” O’Leary said. But rug pulls and devastating hacks are still commonplace. Meanwhile, crypto “whales” and influencers are making a killing by pumping up coins with fake “insider knowledge,” inflating prices before cashing out, and leaving everyday investors holding the bag. It’s the Wild West out there, and the scammers are riding high. O’Leary’s optimism comes as Trump embarks on one new crypto initiative after another. After speaking at the Bitcoin 2024 Conference in Nashville, the then-GOP nominee launched World Liberty Financial . Two days before his inauguration, he unveiled the Official Trump ( TRUMP ) meme coin. And all of those SEC-led investigations into cryptocurrency-related companies (i.e., Binance and Coinbase )? They’re disappearing. Earlier this month, Trump signed an executive order establishing a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve. The move, which designated certain digital assets like XRP, SOL, and ADA as part of a government-backed strategic reserve, has been touted by Trump and his allies as a major step toward integrating crypto into traditional finance. While O’Leary hails these developments as proof of a regulatory turning point, not everyone in the crypto world is convinced. You might also like: Six of Trump’s cabinet members disclose Bitcoin assets worth a total of millions ‘This ain’t it’ Critics argue that Trump’s newfound embrace of digital assets hurts the industry’s credibility and paves the way for crony capitalism. “Crypto is at an existential moment,” Zack Guzmán, a crypto journalist and founder of the Web3 media company Trustless Media, warned on Jan. 18. “I understand the desire to make quick money; I understand the excitement of thinking short-term; I understand stand [sic] why Trump, a man who has grifted in every way to make money for himself would so easily win the industry. But this ain’t it.” Only politically favored crypto firms will thrive under government protection, Guzmán said. The same day Trump decided to launch a memecoin, which skyrocketed 10,000% in value, crypto elitists dressed up in tuxedos and gowns, ready to hobnob at a gala in Washington, D.C. They were completely unaware that Official Trump would soon become a digital dumpster fire (it’s currently down over 84% from its peak). “I’m not saying Trump just used everyone in crypto by throwing a black tie event in DC while simultaneously launching a memecoin without them, but that’s exactly what he did,” Guzmán wrote on Jan. 18. “This industry is his industry now, whether they are aware of it or not. Frankly, that’s extremely sad.” ‘Stupid and embarrassing’ After Trump launched Official Trump, Balaji Srinivasan, a cryptocurrency investor, called meme coins a “zero sum game.” “There is no wealth creation,” he tweeted the day before Trump’s inauguration. “Every buy order is simply matched by a sell order. And after an initial spike, the price eventually crashes and the last buyers lose everything.” Crypto entrepreneur Erik Voorhees wrote on X: Trumpcoin is stupid and embarrassing. Trumpcoin is a signal of sea change in US fintech policy towards much more permissive innovation. Both are true. SkyBridge founder and former White House Communications Director Anthony Scaramucci called it “Idi Amin-level corruption”, referring to the military officer whose Ugandan rule in the 1970s was defined by corruption. And that Bitcoin reserve — the one David Sacks , Trump’s crypto czar, says will be filled with seized digital assets — seems far-fetched, too. Crypto analyst Dessislava Aubert told the Agence France-Presse that the U.S. government must return seized Bitcoin to all victims identified as suffering from a hack. Despite the skepticism, O’Leary remains steadfast in his belief that Trump’s policies will legitimize crypto in ways no previous administration has. “The big news is that this will be the first administration that’s going to say this sector belongs in America. The development should be here. The technology should be mastered here. We should lead the world in it,” O’Leary added. Whether Trump’s promises translate into lasting regulatory clarity—or are merely political grandstanding—remains an open question. For now, the crypto world watches closely, caught between hope and deep-seated doubt. Read more: Sacks purges crypto, but Trump’s digital empire?

Despite the suppressed price movement, several digital assets are exhibiting increased buying pressure that has elevated them into overbought territory, historically serving as a precursor to price corrections. While short-term traders might still find opportunities in such an environment, the risk of a downturn from the overbought conditions outweighs the potential rewards, hence the need to avoid the following two cryptocurrencies next week. BinaryX (BNX) BinaryX (BNX) has recently gained popularity in the cryptocurrency market, recording massive capital inflows. The token, trading at $1.49 as of press time, has seen a 37.49% rise over the past 24 hours. Although these short-term gains might be tempting to investors , the token’s 15-minute relative strength index ( RSI ) of 74.78, coupled with 1-hour, 4-hour, and 12-hour RSI values of 82.13, 83.32, and 70.53, respectively, indicate that BNX is in overbought territory. BNX price and RSI reading. Source: Coinglass Generally, an RSI above 70 suggests an asset may be overvalued and due for a pullback. Indeed, given the platform’s increased on-chain initiatives, there is growing activity around BNX that is making it too hot to make purchases at the moment. In particular, the GameFi token is set to rebrand to Four (FORM), with leading exchanges like Bitget and Binance supporting the transition. The rebranding and a 1:1 token swap aim to refresh the project’s identity. Although the short term might present increased volatility for BNX, the token’s long-term outlook remains strong, given that it has notable investment backing from entities such as Binance Labs. Cosmos (ATOM) Cosmos ( ATOM ) has been among the standout movers amid the suppressed market conditions. For context, ATOM’s price has risen for five consecutive days, coinciding with sustainable demand as its futures open interest increased. ATOM was trading at $4.702 as of press time, gaining 2.66% over the past 24 hours. ATOM price and RSI reading. Source: Coinglass Despite this steady growth, the RSI metrics, 68.75 (15 minutes), 62.51 (1 hour), 71.14 (4 hours), and 62.62 (12 hours), suggest that ATOM is approaching overbought conditions, hinting at the possibility that the asset’s upward momentum might be overstretched. Notably, as of March 15, ATOM’s futures open interest surged to $93 million, the highest since February 2021. This metric tracks unfilled put and call orders, and rising open interest often signals a crypto rebound. However, the current overbought conditions call for caution. ATOM open interest chart.

By decentralizing ownership and incentivizing network participation through blockchain-based rewards, DePIN networks create resilient, community-driven connectivity ecosystems. World Mobile’s implementation of DePIN on Base offers several advantages, including lower costs, greater security, and increased network resilience. Base’s Layer 2 scaling solutions enable seamless blockchain transactions, making it easier for users to participate in and benefit from the network. The collaboration with 51nodes is expected to accelerate the growth of the DePIN model in Europe, fostering innovation in decentralized connectivity solutions and paving the way for similar initiatives in other regions. With DePIN technology gaining traction worldwide, the partnership between World Mobile and 51nodes represents a significant milestone in the evolution of decentralized telecommunications. As blockchain and decentralized networks continue to disrupt traditional industries, initiatives like this underscore the potential of DePIN to reshape the future of global connectivity.
