Speaking on Friday, Vance acknowledged that while the job cuts were a key part of Trump’s plan to slash government spending, not every decision was handled correctly. “Elon himself has said that sometimes you do something, you make a mistake, and then you undo the mistake. I’m accepting of mistakes,” Vance said in an interview with NBC News. He emphasized that errors must be corrected quickly and noted that not all federal employees deserve to be fired. “There are a lot of good people who work in the government—a lot of people who are doing a very good job,” he said. “We want to try to preserve as much of what works in government as possible while eliminating what doesn’t work.” Musk’s mass firings cause legal and political battles For the past seven weeks, Musk has led an aggressive push to cut thousands of federal jobs, implementing Trump’s plan to overhaul the government. The mass layoffs have triggered lawsuits, resistance from judges, and outrage from workers who suddenly found themselves unemployed. Musk, who has been overseeing the effort, has repeatedly dismissed government employees as “fraudsters” who aren’t doing their jobs. Republican vice presidential nominee Sen. JD Vance, R-Ohio, speaks during a vice presidential debate hosted by CBS News, Tuesday, Oct. 1, 2024, in New York. AP Photo/Matt Rourke – ABC7 Vance distanced himself from those sweeping accusations. “I think some people clearly are collecting a check and not doing a job,” he said . “Now, how many people is that? I don’t know, in a 3 million-strong federal workforce, whether it’s a few thousand or much larger than that.” Despite supporting the firings, Vance made it clear that not everyone deserved to lose their job. “However big the problem is, it is a problem when people are living off the generosity of the American taxpayer in a civil service job and not doing the people’s business,” he said. But he also defended those who actually show up and do their work. “You do have a lot of great civil servants who are doing important work,” he said. “I think most of those great civil servants would say we want to be empowered to do our job. We don’t want the person who doesn’t show up five days a week to make it harder for us to do what we need to do.” Vance faces public backlash and protests While Vance toured a plastics factory in Bay City, Michigan, his arrival was met with middle fingers and vulgar signs from protesters. Some held up signs with messages like “Go home, scumbag” as his motorcade passed through. The night before, he was booed at the Kennedy Center in Washington. Even in his own neighborhood in Ohio, he was confronted by pro-Ukraine demonstrators while walking with his 3-year-old daughter. “The thing at the Kennedy Center I thought was funny,” Vance said. “The thing by my house I thought was kind of annoying. I think you just kind of take the good with the bad.” Inside the factory, Vance was welcomed by a pro-Trump crowd filled with local Republicans. He spoke about Trump’s plans to rebuild American manufacturing and boost the economy. But he also warned that the process wouldn’t be immediate. “Now I have to be honest with you,” Vance said. “The road ahead of us is long, but we are already, in just seven short weeks, starting to see early indications of the president’s vision becoming our shared American reality.” Recent polls paint a different picture. A CNN poll showed that 56% of adults disapprove of how Trump is handling the economy. A Quinnipiac University poll found that 54% of registered voters share that disapproval. At the same time, Trump’s push for tariffs on foreign goods has sparked fears of a trade war that could drive up prices for consumers. Foreign policy fights and future ambitions Vance has played a major role in shaping Trump’s foreign policy, delivering a fiery speech last month at the Munich Security Conference where he criticized European leaders over free speech and mass migration. In the Oval Office, he clashed with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, accusing him of being ungrateful for U.S. financial and military aid. “I just try not to be overly scripted,” Vance said. “The classic thing to do in Munich would have been to show up and give a speech about NATO or give a speech about where the Ukraine-Russia thing was at that moment in time, and just sort of thought to myself, like, ‘What is it that I think is really important to say?’” Meanwhile, Trump stirred speculation about Vance’s political future. In a recent Fox News interview, Trump said it was “too early” to talk about Vance as a possible successor in 2028. Asked if he had plans to run for president, Vance dismissed the idea, saying his only focus is doing his job now. “Wow, I’m the vice president-elect of the United States,” Vance recalled thinking on Election Night. “And, you know, if I never go further in politics, I’m totally fine with that, but we get a really good opportunity to do a lot of really good s— the next four years.” But he didn’t rule anything out. “If I do really well for the next four years, everything else will take care of itself,” Vance said.

Some experts think DOGE could hit as high as $50 if asset manager BlackRock files for a DOGE ETF this year. This projection is not unexpected, considering the firm’s precedence in the crypto industry. DOGE Price Catalysts to Watch Dogecoin is facing intense selloff pressure in the crypto market at the moment. Notably, the Elon Musk-led Department of Government Efficiency (D.O.G.E) that was supposed to fuel a DOGE price rally has not achieved this. This has created new conversation points for a potential Dogecoin price trigger. With limited smart contract functionalities, analysts believe the prospect of a Dogecoin ETF can revive DOGE’s price outlook in the mid to long term. As a memecoin, the token has seen intense fluctuations in the past few weeks, down 45.66% in the year-to-date period per data from CoinMarketCap. While the $1 price target feels elusive, more ambitious targets are on the horizon should top asset managers like BlackRock push for direct support of the coin. How Soon Can a Dogecoin ETF Launch Notably, BlackRock already dominates the spot Bitcoin and Ethereum ETF markets. To reiterate its dominance, there is a new Bitcoin ETF allocation to the BlackRock $150 billion model portfolio. With this, proponents believe the asset manager could replicate this strong adoption for a DOGE ETF. Grayscale Investments has already launched its Dogecoin Trust for institutional investors. Many see this move as a step towards the future asset manager filing for a DOGE ETF. Grayscale said the fund is opened for daily subscription to eligible individual and institutional accredited investors. As CoinGape reported earlier, the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has formally acknowledged Grayscale’s spot ETF application for Dogecoin. This acknowledgment departs from the SEC’s historically rigid stance on altcoin ETFs. Bloomberg analysts James Seyffart and Eric Balchunas estimate a 75% chance of a Dogecoin ETF approval. Their prediction quickly sparked excitement about DOGE’s possible price movements. Current Dogecoin Price Projection DOGE price hit a daily high of $0.175 on Friday, following a broader market uptick. Dogecoin is traded at $0.1741, demonstrating a 2.8% increase in the last 24 hours. However, the daily trading volume has decreased by 13.6% to $1.02 billion, suggesting a reduction in investor activity. Still, market participants are projecting an optimistic outlook for the memecoin. Doge Lord, a Dogecoin enthusiast, forecasted the memecoin could rise to $1 during this cycle. Others have forecasted that the Dogecoin price could hit $50 in the long term on the heels of a DOGE filing from BlackRock. While this appears economically impossible, the BlackRock influence might fuel a significant DOGE price rally. Per the current outlook, the possibility of BlackRock filing an XRP ETF application, let alone DOGE ETF this year is very slim. The asset manager has not filed any other ETFs besides BTC and ETH. The asset manager is likely cautious about altcoin ETFs, which were previously under fire from the SEC. However, with the SEC now under a new pro-crypto administration, BlackRock may change its stance on altcoin ETFs. This could eventually lead to DOGE ETF acceptance.

XRP Overtakes Ethereum In Terms of FDV According to Token Terminal, XRP's FDV has exceeded $240 billion. Ethereum's figure is $231.5 billion. However, the Ripple project cryptocurrency is still inferior to ETH in terms of capitalization. The market value of XRP is $140 billion, while Ethereum is about $231 billion. Nevertheless, XRP's rapid growth indicates a significant change in market dynamics. The price of ETH has been falling steadily in recent months. This has been affected by management problems at the Ethereum Foundation, as well as the not-so-successful implementation of the Pectra update. Earlier in the hardfork rollout, there were several failures in the Sepolia and Holesky test networks. Initially, Pectra's introduction into the mainstream was scheduled for late March. However, the developers recently pushed that date back to April. XRP Successes Meanwhile, XRP is experiencing a sharp rise. This is due to greater clarity in the regulation of the crypto industry in the US, as well as support from institutionalizers. Since Donald Trump's re-election, the asset's price has risen more than 300%, peaking at $3.38 in January. Recently, the American president mentioned XRP among the key assets to be included in the US cryptocurrency reserve. This has further boosted investor confidence in this coin. The XRP Ledger (XPRL) blockchain, which has been adopted by financial institutions such as Societe Generale, has also gained widespread adoption. Large asset managers are increasingly applying to launch spot exchange-traded funds (ETFs) based on the Ripple cryptocurrency. Now the crypto community is discussing rumors that BlackRock may soon take this step. ”BlackRock will file ETFs for Solana and XRP. An announcement regarding Solana could come any day now. And regarding XRP, most likely after the conflict with the SEC is over,” predicted Nate Geraci, president of ETF Store. It was reported earlier that the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) plans to close its case against Ripple. There is a possibility that XRP may be recognized as a commodity rather than a security. Such events will have an extremely positive impact on the market dynamics of the asset.",News|Ripple,EN,0,0,XRP|ETH|MARKET|REGULATION|BUSINESS,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-03-15 20:43:14

The shift in liquidity suggests traders are favoring platform-native assets for their utility and stability in uncertain macroeconomic conditions. Exchange Tokens Standout as Crypto markets recover Crypto markets saw a mild recovery of 0.13% on Friday, signaling that recent gains in top-performing assets are largely driven by traders rotating funds across different sectors rather than fresh capital inflows. This reflects a cautious sentiment among investors as global macroeconomic uncertainties—particularly escalating trade war tensions—overshadow easing U.S. inflation data published earlier this week. With broader market sentiment still leaning bearish, traders are reallocating capital between different crypto sectors, either to capitalize on niche media narratives or to exploit arbitrage opportunities. This shift has inadvertently boosted demand within the exchange token sector, led by Binance Coin ( BNB ), OKX (OKB), and Bitget (BGB). According to Coingecko, the Exchange-based tokens’ aggregate valuation grew by $1.9 billion in the last 24 hours, reaching the $122 billion mark at the time of writing. Exchange tokens sector performance, March 14 | Source: Coingecko BNB currently trades at $578.51, posting 0.2% gains intraday, while OKB has climbed to $45.05, reflecting a 7.5% increase in 24 hours. Meanwhile, Bitget’s BGB token trading at $4.18 has also surged 3.7% over the same period. Crypto Market Outlook: Altcoins to Watch ahead of US Fed Rate Decision Exchange token sector outperforming the broader market, affirms the narrative that crypto traders are moving liquidity into exchange-native assets. These tokens typically offer fee discounts, staking rewards, and governance benefits—enhancing their attractiveness in high-volatility market phases as observed this week. If this dynamic persists, BNB, OKB, and BGB could see further upside, particularly if volatility drives more trading activity. However, strategic traders may be unwilling to deploy large leverage positions to drive aggressive rallies. Without fresh bullish catalysts, buyer fatigue could set in, leading to potential liquidations across the board.” BNB Price Forecast: Breakout Momentum Builds as Bulls Target $650 Resistance BNB price has surged 21.6% over the past four days, reclaiming key technical levels as bullish momentum strengthens. The price has decisively broken above the middle Bollinger Band (20-day moving average), currently at $590, signaling a shift in market structure. The upper Bollinger Band at $637 now serves as the next resistance, and a successful breakout could drive BNB toward the $650 level. BNB Price Outlook The MACD histogram has flipped green for the first time in nearly three weeks, confirming a bullish crossover as the MACD line trends above the signal line. This momentum shift suggests increasing buying pressure, reinforcing the probability of continued upside. The recent price expansion has also been accompanied by rising volume, with the last four daily candles showing higher trading activity—typically a strong indicator of trend continuation. However, if resistance at $637 proves too strong, a rejection could lead to a retest of the $590 support level. A failure to hold above this range would expose BNB to a potential pullback toward the lower Bollinger Band at $542. Despite this risk, the overall market structure remains bullish, and a sustained close above $637 could trigger a fresh rally targeting $680 and beyond. Bitget (BGB) Price Forecast: Bulls Could Consolidate above $6 as if Market Demand Persists BGB price is showing signs of stabilization after a multi-week pullback, with buyers stepping in to defend key support levels. Despite recent bearish pressure, the price remains well above the 50-week and 200-week moving averages, signaling the broader uptrend is intact. The Parabolic SAR dots remain positioned above the price, indicating the ongoing correction phase, but a shift below could confirm a bullish reversal. Bitget (BGB) Price Forecast Currently trading at $4.455, BGB finds itself in a crucial zone where demand is beginning to resurface. The Bollinger Band Percentile (BBP) indicator has dipped into negative territory, reflecting the recent selling pressure, but this often signals an oversold condition that could pave the way for a recovery. If bulls can reclaim momentum, a breakout above $5 would open the door for a rally toward $6, aligning with prior resistance and the upper SAR targets. Conversely, failure to sustain the current level may lead to further downside risk. A break below $4 would expose lower supports, with the next major cushion near $3 OKB Price Forecast: Bulls Targeting $50 Retest OKB price is showing strong bullish momentum, rebounding sharply from its recent lows with a decisive green candle. The breakout above prior resistance suggests growing buying pressure, confirmed by the positive shift in the BBP (Bollinger Band Percentile) indicator, which has flipped green for the first time in weeks. This shift signals increasing bullish momentum after a prolonged downtrend. OKB Price Forecast The price is currently trading at $46.60, with the next significant resistance levels at the 50-day and 200-day moving averages, sitting at $47.95 and $49.78, respectively. A successful break above these levels could fuel a rally toward the psychological $50 mark and beyond. Additionally, the Parabolic SAR dots have shifted below the price action, indicating a trend reversal and reinforcing the bullish outlook. However, failure to maintain momentum could see OKB price face resistance at these key moving averages, potentially leading to a rejection and pullback. A break back below $44 would invalidate the bullish setup, with the next downside support resting near $38.48.

The goal? Reshaping the U.S. economy and forcing other nations to negotiate on his terms. But while some American businesses are thriving, others are drowning under skyrocketing costs. The biggest winners right now are U.S. steel and aluminum manufacturers. Trump slapped a 25% tariff on imported steel and aluminum, instantly making domestic production more competitive. U.S. Steel and Cleveland-Cliffs are now in high demand, and Century Aluminum, the nation’s largest primary aluminum producer, says these tariffs will drive a “resurgence” in American aluminum production. The results are clear: hot-rolled steel prices jumped to $945 per ton, the highest since February 2024, and aluminum prices surged 45 cents per pound, passing $990 per metric ton in a single day. Companies cashing in on Trump’s trade war Anheuser-Busch, the company behind Bud Light and Michelob, is one of the biggest winners. The company doesn’t have to worry about import tariffs because 99% of its beer is brewed in the U.S. and 99% of its ingredients come from American farmers. That insulation from global trade wars has helped Anheuser-Busch’s stock jump 24% this year while competitors struggle with rising costs. Another group raking in profits? Warehouse owners. American companies are stockpiling raw materials and goods, preparing for even worse tariffs. All of that extra inventory needs storage, driving up demand for warehouse space. The gold and silver markets are also thriving. Investors see precious metals as a safe bet during economic uncertainty, and that’s exactly what’s happening now. Since the start of the year, gold prices have soared 13% to over $3,000 per ounce, while silver has climbed 14% to $34 per ounce. XAUUSD 1-hour price chart. Source/TradingView Then there’s the tech sector—at least, the software and AI side of it. Palantir, Oracle, Microsoft, and Salesforce are dodging the worst of the trade war because they don’t rely on Chinese factories. Wedbush analyst Dan Ives said Palantir is in a particularly strong position, thanks to its U.S. government contracts and AI technology investments. Industries getting crushed by tariffs The stock market is bleeding. The Nasdaq has lost 2,300 points in just 30 days, a 12% drop, and the S&P 500 has crashed more than 10% from its recent highs. Investors are dumping tech stocks that depend on Chinese supply chains. No company is feeling it worse than Apple. Trump hit Chinese imports with a 20% tariff, and Apple relies on China for manufacturing. The company’s stock is down 13% since January, and analysts say moving production back to the U.S. would take at least five years and cost over $20 billion. The automakers aren’t doing much better. Ford, GM, and Tesla are scrambling as raw material costs surge. Barclays analysts estimate that Trump’s tariffs will add $400 to the cost of every car built in the U.S. That’s not good news for Tesla, which has already seen its stock plunge 36% this year. The alcohol industry is taking massive losses. Trump just announced a 200% tariff on European wine and champagne, responding to the EU’s 50% tariff on American whiskey. Retailers are scrambling to stockpile bottles, knowing prices will soon skyrocket. A $109 bottle of Chateau Rauzan Segla Margaux will cost $375 once the new tariffs kick in. It’s not just luxury goods suffering. California’s almond industry is in trouble. One-third of California’s almonds are shipped to Europe, and now they’re facing retaliatory tariffs. Farmers are bracing for major revenue losses, and industry experts say it could take years to recover. Retaliation from other countries Other nations aren’t backing down. Canada just hit back with $21 billion in retaliatory tariffs, slamming American farm products, whiskey, and other goods. Some Canadian retailers have even pulled Tennessee whiskey from their shelves entirely, refusing to sell American-made liquor in protest of Trump’s trade war. Mexico and China are also pushing back. China’s 20% tariff on American imports is a direct response to Trump’s policies, and it’s putting serious pressure on Tesla, Apple, and automakers. One company pleading for help is Tesla. In a letter to the U.S. Trade Representative’s office, Tesla warned that it faces “disproportionate impacts” from retaliatory tariffs. The electric vehicle company is already struggling with supply chain issues, and now it’s being hit from multiple directions. The stock market is reacting badly. The Dow Jones just dropped 1,000 points in the last 30 days, marking a 2.4% decline. Investors are on edge, but the Trump administration isn’t worried. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent shrugged off concerns, saying , “We’re focused on the real economy. I’m not concerned about a little bit of volatility over three weeks.” Cryptopolitan Academy: Want to grow your money in 2025? Learn how to do it with DeFi in our upcoming webclass.

The crypto exchange filed Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) requests to uncover details about U.S. regulator’s actions against crypto companies. Coinbase alleged that the Federal Deposit Insurance Commission (FDIC) and the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) have responded slowly. The trading platform said the agencies are either holding back key details or releasing documents with many important details left out. Coinbase is frustrated by the lack of clarity as it intensifies its fight to expose what it sees as unfair targeting of the crypto industry. Coinbase Fights Against Operation Chokepoint 2.0 The crypto exchange filed a Freedom of Information Act request to obtain documents from the Federal Deposit Insurance Commission. The documents were supposed to shed light on the agency’s involvement in Operation Chokepoint 2.0. This operation is an alleged effort by regulators to restrict crypto companies from accessing banking services. However, when the FDIC finally responded, Coinbase was not satisfied. In a recent X post , Coinbase’s Chief Legal Officer, Paul Grewal, accused the FDIC of being slow and unhelpful. He believes the agency is deliberately withholding key details about its actions. Coinbase wants to see proof that the FDIC properly documented its role in banking restrictions against crypto companies. However, the agency has not provided clear answers so far. Although the FDIC has promised to search for more records, Coinbase is not convinced it will get the full truth. The Demand for SEC’s Legal Spending Records The FDIC is not the only regulator Coinbase is challenging. The company has also filed a FOIA request against the SEC. This time, Coinbase wants to know how much money the agency has spent on legal battles against crypto companies. For years, the SEC has aggressively targeted crypto firms with lawsuits, but many of these cases have ended in dismissal. Recently, the SEC dropped its case against Kraken and OpenSea. The agency’s legal actions against Coinbase were widely criticized, but they eventually ended. The crypto firm believes that the SEC wasted public resources by going after crypto businesses instead of providing clear rules for the industry. The exchange is especially concerned about the costs of these legal actions. The SEC often hires expensive third-party contractors to assist in its cases, which likely increases the financial burden on taxpayers. Coinbase Calls for Transparency in Crypto Regulation Coinbase’s fight with regulators shows the ongoing problem between the crypto industry and the U.S. government. Under the previous administration, regulators made it harder for crypto businesses instead of giving them clear rules to follow. The exchange wants the FDIC and SEC to be open about their actions, calling for transparency. Coinbase is determined to uncover the truth and the result could change the future of the crypto industry.

The issuer is eyeing March 28 as a tentative date for the liquidation of both ETFs amid a wave of new filings in the US. 21Shares Set To Liquidate Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs According to an announcement, crypto ETF issuer 21Shares has disclosed plans to ditch its Bitcoin and Ethereum futures ETFs. Per the announcement, the affected ETFs are the ARK 21Shares Active Bitcoin Ethereum Strategy ETF and the ARK 21Shares Active On-Chain Bitcoin Strategy ETF. While the press release did not give clear reasons for the liquidations, it hinged its decision on a periodic review of its offerings. The statement cited a need to align existing product lineups with market dynamics and clients’ needs in a changing landscape. However, pundits say the liquidations are a result of jarring ETF outflows in recent months. Shareholders can sell their holdings up until March 27, a date touted as the last trading day for both ETFs. 21Shares plans to put the final nail in the coffin for both ETFs on March 28, liquidating all remaining assets. “Shareholders who continue to hold shares of a Fund on the Fund’s Liquidation Date will receive a liquidating distribution with a value equal to their proportionate ownership interest in the Fund,” read the press release. Increased ETF Activity In The Cryptoverse Despite the wave of outflows, the ETF space is sizzling with frenetic activity. Buoyed by impressive returns, 21Shares slashed fees to 0.49% for its Bitcoin Ethereum Core ETPs. Bitwise has rolled out its OWNB ETF to track companies holding Bitcoin on their balance sheets. Bitcoin ETF investors continue to put their faith in offerings in the face of price amid Rex Shares launching the first Bitcoin Corporate Bond Convertible ETF Outside of Bitcoin, several issuers have filed for XRP, HBAR, DOGE, and AVAX ETFs with the US SEC.

AAVE was one of those golden opportunities—ignored by many at its launch, only to explode in value, making early buyers incredibly wealthy. While some took the leap and secured life-changing returns, others hesitated, waiting for a “better time” to buy. The pain of missing out on massive gains is something every crypto trader knows too well, but history always presents a second chance. Right now, that second chance is Qubetics ($TICS)—and the window to get in early is closing fast. Unlike hype-driven projects, Qubetics is built for real-world utility, tackling blockchain development barriers with its QubeQode IDE and creating a seamless multi-chain ecosystem. It’s not just another token—it’s a fully-fledged blockchain platform with strong fundamentals and high adoption potential. With its Qubetics presale attracting serious attention, early adopters are securing their positions before prices climb higher. Opportunities like this don’t wait. If you missed AAVE’s early days, don’t make the same mistake again—Qubetics could be one of the best cryptos to buy this month. Qubetics: The Best Crypto to Buy This Month Before It’s Too Late Qubetics’ early supporters had a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity—whitelist members secured $TICS at just $0.01 with zero upfront investment. Since its launch on September 29, 2024, the presale has progressed through multiple stages, with prices increasing by 10% every seven days. Now, Qubetics is in its 25th presale stage, priced at just $0.1074, and it’s still one of the best cryptos to buy this month before it hits exchanges. With over $15 million raised, more than 23,000 token holders, and 499 million $TICS tokens sold, Qubetics is proving it’s a force to be reckoned with. But what really makes it one of the best cryptos to buy this month is the potential ROI for those who invest early. If you put in $1,000 today: If $TICS reaches $0.25, your investment becomes $2,326 (132.66% ROI) If $TICS hits $1, your portfolio grows to $9,206 (830.65% ROI) If $TICS reaches $5, you’d be sitting on $46,500 (4,553.26% ROI) If $TICS hits $10, that $1,000 turns into $92,065 (9,206.51% ROI) At $15, you’d have $138,597 (13,859.77% ROI) It’s no wonder why early investors are calling Qubetics one of the best cryptos to buy this month. Beyond its financial upside, Qubetics is reshaping blockchain development with its QubeQode IDE. Right now, creating blockchain applications requires extensive coding knowledge, making it inaccessible for many businesses. QubeQode IDE eliminates this barrier by offering a drag-and-drop interface, form-based configuration, and a code snippet library, allowing even non-developers to create blockchain-powered applications effortlessly. Imagine a small business wanting to build a secure tokenized rewards program for its customers. Instead of hiring a team of blockchain developers, they can use QubeQode IDE to set up their system in minutes—no coding required. Or think about a gaming studio that wants to integrate NFTs and in-game assets on multiple blockchains. With QubeQode, they can do it seamlessly, without writing complex smart contracts from scratch. This kind of accessibility is what makes Qubetics more than just another crypto—it’s a game-changing blockchain ecosystem. But time is running out. With each stage lasting just seven days, the price is about to increase again. If you’re serious about crypto, this is the best crypto presale to get into before it’s too late. AAVE: The Crypto That Left Many Watching From the Sidelines AAVE’s story is a painful reminder that the best investment opportunities don’t wait. When AAVE first launched, many dismissed it as just another DeFi lending protocol, failing to see the groundbreaking potential behind its liquidity pools and decentralized borrowing system. Those who ignored it at its early stages missed out on one of the biggest success stories in DeFi. During its ICO phase, AAVE was trading for mere cents, but once its ecosystem gained traction, the price skyrocketed. AAVE’s all-time high left many regretting their hesitation, as early investors saw unbelievable returns while skeptics could only watch from the sidelines. Today, AAVE remains one of the most recognized DeFi platforms, proving that early adoption is the key to making life-changing gains in crypto. Right now, Qubetics is in the same position AAVE was before its breakout. It has strong fundamentals, a real-world use case, and a fast-moving presale that’s attracting serious attention. The difference? You still have time to act before Qubetics goes mainstream. The question is, will you take this opportunity, or will you let history repeat itself? Final Thoughts: Don’t Watch From the Sidelines—Join This Crypto Presale Now You saw what happened with AAVE—early adopters won big, while those who hesitated missed out. Qubetics is now in that same early-stage window, and with over $15 million raised, the momentum is undeniable. Among the best cryptos to buy this month, Qubetics stands out with its real-world applications, strong fundamentals, and massive ROI potential. But time is running out. Each presale stage lasts only seven days, meaning the price will rise again soon. The best move? Join this crypto presale now before it’s too late. The best cryptos to buy this month aren’t just about speculation—they’re about recognizing the future before everyone else does. Will you be the one who takes action, or will you watch another opportunity slip away?

The G7 foreign ministers issued the warning through a joint statement after their meeting in Canada, as President Donald Trump, who is pushing for a truce, tries to get President Vladimir Putin to sign on. Ukraine had already agreed to a 30-day ceasefire, but Russia hesitated. Marco Rubio, Trump’s Secretary of State, told the G7 that Washington was still trying to figure out if Putin was delaying negotiations on purpose. “The question is, are we actually moving towards a ceasefire, or is this a delay tactic?” Rubio said. While the G7 is threatening economic retaliation, Trump has held back from immediate US sanctions, hoping diplomacy can work first. US President Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin in 2016. Photograph: Chris McGrath/Getty Images – The Guardian The €300 billion in Russian central bank assets, mainly cash and government bonds, have been frozen since 2022, and there is increasing momentum to use it against Moscow. Rubio indicated that any ceasefire deal would require both sides to make concessions. “I’ve never heard Trump say that Russia has a right to take all of Ukraine and do whatever they want there,” Rubio said on Friday. Meanwhile, Trump’s national security team is set to meet after Steve Witkoff, the president’s envoy, returns from Moscow with updates on where Putin stands. For months, Washington focused on pressuring Kyiv to agree to an end to the war, but now that Putin has stalled, the attention has turned to Russia. Trump, in a Truth Social post, described his recent talks with Putin as “good and productive,” but there is still no official agreement from Moscow. Canada’s Foreign Minister Mélanie Joly made it clear that the next move is on Russia. “The ball is now in Russia’s court when it comes to Ukraine,” she said . She added that the G7 was unified in its approach. The joint statement from the G7 meeting was not easy to finalize, as one official said that the Ukraine section was a subject of tense discussions overnight and the US argued that strong language could disrupt talks with Russia, so the wording was softened to avoid pissing Putin off. Britain and France, though, wanted a harsher tone, pushing for stronger economic pressure on Moscow, which makes sense as those guys have made it pretty clear how much they do not like Putin. Putin hesitates as Russian forces gain ground in Kursk While ceasefire negotiations stall, Russia’s military has advanced in Kursk, where Ukraine had previously reclaimed over 1,000 square kilometers. Despite claiming to support a ceasefire, Putin insists that “issues” need to be resolved first, while President Volodymyr Zelenskyy called it an excuse to stall negotiations some more. Trump, in another Truth Social post, claimed that the Russian military had surrounded thousands of Ukrainian troops and that he personally urged Putin to “spare their lives.” Ukraine’s General Staff denied the claim, saying that fighting in Kursk was ongoing and that no Ukrainian soldiers were surrounded. The Russian leader cut his teeth as a KGB spy in the 1980s in Dresden, an experience that left him with an enduring fascination for all things German. | POOL photo by Artyom Geodakyan/EPA-EFE – Politico In response, Putin publicly urged Ukrainian troops to surrender on Friday, saying it would align with Trump’s request. The US had temporarily cut off military aid and intelligence-sharing with Kyiv, pushing them to accept the ceasefire deal. But now that Putin is stalling, the Trump administration has resumed military assistance. “The devil is in the details, and they will start offering you details to drag you into a dialogue, delay certain processes, and postpone the end of the war,” Zelenskyy said. He is expecting a “strong reaction” from Trump in response to Putin’s lack of commitment. The biggest challenge in the negotiations remains territorial control. Zelenskyy admitted that this would be the hardest part of any peace agreement. “Ceasefire and territories are the most difficult moments [of a negotiation],” Zelenskyy said on Friday. “The first is difficult because it requires courage and political will, the second because it requires a difficult dialogue.” Cryptopolitan Academy: Want to grow your money in 2025?

Key levels to watch include $2,600, $2,500, and short-term ranges from $2,000 to $2,320, with a stop placed below $1,500. The main risk is the equities market; a relief bounce could trigger a similar reaction in crypto, particularly ETH. Bitcoin remains dominant, but a short-term bounce in ETH/BTC could see altcoins gain market share temporarily. Summary Crypto has had a crazy start to 2025, to say the least. Altcoins have been bleeding for the past few months, with Bitcoin slowly following behind—along with equities. Today, I want to discuss a potential trade idea for Ethereum ( ETH-USD ), as the market has dropped nearly 50% from its December 2024 highs of $4,000 per coin and now sitting at 1850s. I'm seeing potential for a 30% bounce on Ethereum based on the levels I'm watching. However, this is not a guarantee—nothing in the markets is (no free lunch). I'll have to play this level by level. Monthly Chart Let's start by analyzing the monthly chart. In 2022, while the market was in a bearish phase, from its all-time high the market sold off approximately 55% , bounced back, and again started its downward move creating a lower high. Now if we look at the recent data and mark the local high down to the recent low, the market has fallen approximately the same number, around 57% -which is basically the same major drop that happened in 2022. TradingView (ETH) We are also seeing a retest of the prior consolidation zone that preceded the rally in October 2023, when the overall markets bottomed and began their next leg up. This is a level where I would expect a potential reaction. Does that mean we'll bounce here and head toward all-time highs? Very unlikely. However, the point of this trading level is that there is potential for some kind of bounce. Weekly Chart Zooming into the weekly chart, I've annotated the overall trend that has been respected since the COVID low in 2020. This marks the fourth touch of this trendline, coinciding with the monthly consolidation zone I highlighted in the chart above. TradingView (ETH) The first orange-shaded area outlines the move from the low after the 55% correction from the 2022 top. This pattern is one that I'm paying attention to currently. Will I expect it to be replicated? No. Still, I'm using it to frame a potential bounce at this key area. It could be a 20% bounce, a 25% bounce, or even a 50% bounce. Or maybe not a bounce at all: this is where matters of risk management come into play, which is to be discussed later. Daily Chart Now lets take a look at the current daily chart. I've marked out the current trading range, from the high of 4,109 and the low of 1,752. The 50% level of this range is at 2,931 , which is just around a 50% move from current levels. This level would be my strong bull case short term level as in the final level I'd look to close this potential trade idea. TradingView (ETH) Below this level, we have clear areas where price previously rejected and formed resistance. The $2,600 range was a consolidation zone before the market moved lower. This will be a crucial level to watch, as any signs of weakness here would require trade management. Below that, we have the recent rejection that occurred on the Monday following the news about the Crypto Reserve. This level sits around the low $2,500s . Below these levels I am watching short term ranges from: 2000s (Would like to see a reclaim) 2150s 2320s H4 Chart The overall trend on the lower timeframes has remained bearish, so this is something I would need to see shift. We’ve started to see the potential for a short-term bottom here in the $1,700s. TradingView (ETH) In terms of market structure, I would want to see the H4 chart start forming higher highs and higher lows, signaling the potential daily/weekly retracement I'm looking for. Current Trade (Risk Management) I've provided my current trade thesis below. I will not be holding this trade all the way to the $2,900s. At the end of the day, I have no idea if ETH will have the momentum in the current environment to make a move that high, which is why I have significant levels before then within my analysis. TradingView (ETH) The stop placement here is important. This is not a random stop placed in the $1,500s because I don't want to lose a certain amount. Within my system, this is where I have to place it, as it's below a key weekly low from October 2023, where price retested the weekly trendline I discussed. This is ultimately where I would believe the bull-case bounce is unlikely. Seasonality Talk Like I discussed in my recent bull case for Bitcoin , the main risk here is equities. Based on the seasonality trend from the last 20 years, the markets typically see a potential bottom around February and March and then start to trend higher. I'm not taking this as a potential bottom signaling the continuation of the ultimate bull run we've been in, but I think this data can help frame the situation. If we do see a decent bounce before continuing lower in equities, that would, in my view, be enough to trigger a bounce in BTC/ALTs. EquityClock ETH/BTC I'm sure there are no surprises here, as I constantly preach that Bitcoin is the crypto market. BTC has outpaced ETH since 2022. The ETH/BTC pair is currently trading at the lows from December 2020! TradingView (ETH/BTC) Again, do I think this is the ultimate bottom here? Not really. I still believe Bitcoin is the dominant long-term market. But with how things are aligning, it makes sense to me that we could see the start of a potential bounce, where Bitcoin might lose some of its market share in the short term, giving altcoins a squeeze higher. Conclusion & Risks As I've stated, the main risk here is the equities market and whether we can finally see some sort of relief bounce. I believe that the macro view is still a bit shaky, and I doubt we’ll see a move straight back up toward ATHs in any risk-on markets, but that isn’t what I'm looking for here. I've started a position and outlined my key levels that I'll be watching, along with potentially locking in profits depending on how the market reacts around these price points. I hope this analysis helps and gives you another perspective on the crypto markets, especially the potential short term price action on ETH.",ETH-USD,EN,0,0,MARKET|TRADING|ETH|BTC|ALTCOIN,"{'name': 'Seeking Alpha', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/seekingalpha.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",seekingalpha,2025-03-15 21:27:53

Notably, recent market movements and mixed fundamentals have divided analysts. While some remain optimistic about Bitcoin’s potential to recover , others are sounding the alarm, with one prominent strategist warning of a potential collapse to $10,000. Mike McGlone, senior commodity strategist at Bloomberg Intelligence, warned about Bitcoin’s downside risks, citing macroeconomic factors and market trends that could lead to a severe decline. In a tweet on Friday, McGlone questioned whether Bitcoin could revisit $10,000, drawing attention to the rising price of gold and potential market headwinds. “Gold is up about the same amount in 2025 to March 13—about 15%—that Bitcoin is down. But with Bitcoin at about $80,000, what stops those trajectories?” he wrote . McGlone also pointed to a potential 6% decline in the S&P 500 as a key risk factor, adding that the current market cycle could mirror the speculative bubble seen 25 years ago. In an interview with Yahoo Finance, McGlone emphasized the appeal of traditional safe-haven assets amid economic uncertainty. “ Treasuries and gold are still the primary safe-haven plays ,” he explained , highlighting gold’s recent rally to $3,000 an ounce as evidence of growing investor caution. He also suggested that a broader market downturn could accelerate Bitcoin’s decline, stating, “ The riskiest assets are cryptos… I can point out that Bitcoin’s peak looks to be around $100,000, which is why gold continues to go up.” McGlone is not alone in predicting further downside for Bitcoin. Earlier this week, Arthur Hayes, former CEO of BitMEX, suggested that Bitcoin could drop to $70,000 before staging a recovery. According to Hayes, a 36% correction from Bitcoin’s peak of $110,000 would be “normal for a bull market.” He argued that Bitcoin’s next major rally would likely depend on worsening macroeconomic conditions and potential monetary policy shifts from major central banks, including the U.S. Federal Reserve and the European Central Bank. Elsewhere, Markus Thielen, head of research at 10x Research, suggested that Bitcoin may enter a prolonged consolidation phase after reaching its recent all-time high. He noted that Bitcoin’s current technical structure resembles a “high flag” pattern, a formation that typically signals bullish continuation. However, he warned that signs of weakness within the pattern indicate market uncertainty, making it unclear whether Bitcoin will sustain its uptrend or face further corrections. However, not all analysts foresee a steep drop. On-chain data from CryptoQuant suggests that Bitcoin is nearing an “oversold” zone, with its MVRV ratio falling to 1.8, close to the 2024 correction low of 1.71. According to the firm, if Bitcoin fell to $70,000, it could present a favorable entry point for investors and spark a rebound.

In a statement on Friday, Coinbase Institutional confirmed that its derivatives arm has filed with the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) to self-certify futures contracts for both Natural Gas (NGS) and Cardano (ADA). “We’re excited to announce that Coinbase Derivatives has filed with the CFTC to self-certify Natural Gas (NGS) futures and Cardano ($ADA) futures… We anticipate going live with these products on Monday, March 31 .,” read the tweet from Coinbase Institutional. For context, futures allow investors to bet on the future price direction of an underlying asset like ADA without needing to own the asset outright. Coinbase Institutional, a division of the global cryptocurrency exchange, was established to cater to large-scale investors, including hedge funds, asset managers, and corporations. Over the years, it has expanded its product offerings to include prime brokerage services, staking, and a range of derivative instruments designed to meet the needs of institutional clients. Notably, in the last quarter of 2024, Coinbase Institutional reported a trading volume of $345 billion, accounting for 78% of the platform’s total trades during that period. One of the most notable milestones for Coinbase Institutional was the launch of the Coinbase Derivatives Exchange, formerly known as FairX, which the company acquired in 2022. This strategic acquisition allowed Coinbase to expand its regulated derivatives offerings, addressing the growing demand for crypto futures and options among institutional investors. As of 2025, Coinbase Institutional serves thousands of institutional clients and manages billions of dollars in assets. The introduction of ADA futures signals a broader commitment to diversifying its portfolio and reinforcing its position as a leader in institutional crypto adoption. That said, including ADA futures could catalyze price appreciation, providing institutional investors with a regulated avenue to gain exposure to Cardano. Historically, the introduction of futures contracts for major cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum has led to increased liquidity and price discovery. Moreover, ADA’s potential for growth has been bolstered by its recent inclusion in a policy directive from former U.S. President Donald Trump. The executive order reportedly acknowledged ADA’s role in decentralized finance (DeFi) and blockchain innovation, positioning it favorably for regulatory clarity and institutional adoption. On the regulatory front, confidence in ADA’s standing has strengthened following key legal victories. Charges against Coinbase were dismissed in February 2025, followed by a similar outcome for Kraken in March 2025. Meanwhile, the Binance case, where ADA was also targeted, has been put on hold. This comes after the SEC initially classified ADA as an unregistered security in its 2023 lawsuits against Coinbase and Binance. That said, the launch of ADA futures on Coinbase Derivatives could mark a turning point for Cardano’s institutional adoption positioning ADA for further institutional adoption and price growth in the coming months.",Cryptocurrency|News|ADA|Cardano|Coinbase,EN,0,0,ADA|EXCHANGE|TRADING|BUSINESS|REGULATION,"{'name': 'ZyCrypto', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/zycrypto.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",zycrypto,2025-03-15 21:53:38

Ripple-affiliated cryptocurrency XRP has managed to overtake Ether (ETH) in valuation, but this only applies to their fully diluted market caps. This flipping comes amid bullish developments in the XRP ecosystem, while the Ethereum network deals with stiff competition from rivals such as Solana. XRP Surpasses Ethereum In FDV According to CoinGecko, Ethereum ranks as the second-biggest crypto, boasting a market capitalization of $231.2 billion. This is considerably bigger than XRP’s market cap of $135.7 billion. However, there seems to be a reversal of fortunes for these two top cryptocurrencies. As of press time, XRP’s fully diluted valuation stood at $234 billion. Despite the higher market cap, Ether’s FDV is lower at $232 billion. The FDV is a metric that measures the cumulative value of all existing tokens by current market price, whilst market cap only considers the tokens already in circulation. Simply put, this suggests that if all XRP tokens were in circulation, including those currently locked in Ripple’s escrow accounts, the token’s market capitalization would have usurped Ether’s. Notably, all the Ethereum tokens are already in circulation. Whether or not this FDV flipping translates into an actual market cap shift remains to be seen. At Ether’s current price of $1,923, XRP will close the market cap gap between the two assets and overthrow ETH’s reign as the second largest crypto if its price hits $4 — a roughly 67% increase from its current price of $2.35. XRP surpassed Tether’s USDT to become the industry’s third largest crypto earlier in January. If the Ripple-promoted token topples Ether, it would signal a monumental shift in the cryptosphere. All Eyes On XRP The recent XRP optimism has been fueled by Franklin Templeton’s spot XRP ETF filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The $1.5 trillion investment giant has joined other asset managers, including Bitwise, 21Shares, and WisdomTree in the race to introduce such an XRP fund in the U.S. market. Recent reports have revealed that the protracted legal spat between Ripple and the SEC is finally wrapping up. The blockchain payments firm is apparently negotiating more favorable terms after being slapped with a $125 million fine and injunction last year. Meanwhile, the SEC reportedly considers XRP a commodity rather than an unregistered security.",Cryptocurrency|News|Ethereum News|Ripple|XRP News,EN,0,0,XRP|MARKET|ETH|TRADING|REGULATION,"{'name': 'ZyCrypto', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/zycrypto.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",zycrypto,2025-03-15 21:56:32

Market signals show bearishness as Litecoin (LTC) continues its attempt to recover $150 despite maintaining its $89 price point. Before Mutuum Finance enters Phase 3 of its presale series purchasers have committed $3.4 million and secured more than 5,700 token holders thus indicating growing support for the forthcoming $0.06 exchange listing price. Presale Energy for Mutuum Finance Those participating during Mutuum Finance Presale Phase 3 can seize $0.02 tokens while preparing for a 25% growth to $0.025 which experts predict will happen within days. Project tokenomics establishes a specific financial pathway where Phase 3 investors receive 3-fold returns when they purchase at the $0.06 value. Analysts forecast that MUTM tokens will rise to $3 as people start using the lending protocol and this growth would represent a staggering 14,900% increase from their current price. The specific characteristics of this system drive positive expectations. Mutuum Finance maintains a platform model which spends fees on purchasing MUTM tokens to stimulate continuous token demand through this mechanism. The mtToken system alongside user deposits create a permanent long-term holding environment that drives users to retain tokens in their portfolio. Liquidity mining and staking initiatives which consume 74% of the supply basis make it unlikely for sell pressure to emerge after launch. Litecoin’s Uphill Battle The rising attention towards Mutuum Finance generates challenging circumstances for Litecoin. LTC trades at $89 but its momentum indicators manifest strong bearish control as traders attempt to push prices past $93.17. Presently Litecoin faces bearish conditions because the 50-day SMA stands at $118.94 above current prices and RSI-14 shows weak momentum at 32. The 14,900% growth potential of MUTM dwarfs the max $201 all-time high projection for Litecoin which reflects only a 125% increase from current levels. Market dynamics separate these two cryptocurrencies from each other. The declining daily trading volume of Litecoin at $88.6 million demonstrates that investors are losing their interest in this cryptocurrency. During the recent weeks of its presale Mutuum Finance managed to accumulate $3.4 million from intense investor interest. The Shiba Inu millionaire bets that DeFi utility within MUTM will surpass Litecoin’s store-of-value functions. Secure strategic Growth The Mutuum Finance team is completing a Certik audit of its smart contracts, a move to increase trust from investors. Once the results have been tabulated, they will be announced via official channels, further demonstrating the project’s dedication to transparency. Until then, this one is in line with its orderly growth strategy that values ecosystem stability over hype-induced peaking. Buyers are taking advantage of the last presale phase under $0.025, driving down the limited inventory for Phase 3. The window to get coins at this level is closing with exchange listings around the corner. Early participants secure a 200% gain at launch and are poised for a 500%+ growth spurt when lending pools are made live. Timing the Market Shift Litecoin has until 150 — a target the backers of Mutuum Finance say MUTM will hit first. As LTC fights resistance zones and low volatility, the swift presale of MUTM and its structured tokenomics offer a dichotomy of asymmetry. For investors looking for assets that aren’t moored to the cycles of Bitcoin, Mutuum Finance is a measured way of engaging with a burgeoning frontier of decentralized lending. Phase 3 ends soon, get your MUTM tokens for $0.02. Head over to the Mutuum Finance official site to get involved with the presale and keep up to date with the audit. The market tides shifts for the prep – act fast before the liquidity events change everything.

Beyond the well-known Bitcoin, various options present distinct technology and growth prospects. This exploration focuses on four currencies, each offering unique features that appeal to a range of participants. These four can be considered the best altcoins for different kinds of people, offering opportunities for gains. Identifying projects with practical uses, active development, and strong communities is crucial. BlockDAG (BDAG), Solana (SOL), Dogecoin (DOGE), and Cardano (ADA) have recently captured attention due to their performance. 1. BlockDAG (BDAG) BlockDAG (BDAG) aims to enhance blockchain efficiency through a directed acyclic graph (DAG) structure. This design allows for parallel transaction processing, reducing network congestion and lowering fees, thus maintaining speed and affordability. The BlockDAG presale has garnered notable interest, securing over $202.5 million with the sale of more than 18.8 billion coins. Currently priced at $0.0248 in batch 27, early participants have observed a 2380% increase. The central concept of the original article’s BlockDAG section centered on the project’s technological approach to transaction processing. Many consider BDAG one of the best altcoins, given its rapid presale expansion and advanced technology. Developers emphasize scalability, highlighting that BlockDAG’s parallel processing eliminates bottlenecks common in traditional blockchain systems. The community shows considerable enthusiasm for the potential impact of this design on decentralized applications. If BlockDAG meets its objectives, it could capture a substantial portion of the market from slower competitors. The combination of strong funding, an engaged community, and advanced architecture positions BDAG as a promising option for those interested in long-term digital currency participation. 2. Solana (SOL) Solana (SOL) remains a top choice among the best altcoins due to its high-speed blockchain, which can handle thousands of transactions per second with minimal fees. It has established itself as a leading platform for decentralized finance, non-fungible tokens, and decentralized application development, attracting both developers and users. Solana’s expanding ecosystem makes it a viable alternative to other major blockchain platforms. Despite its capabilities, Solana has experienced network disruptions, raising concerns about reliability. Developers continue to work on improvements, although some users remain cautious. Nonetheless, with a solid history in decentralized applications and prominent partnerships, Solana maintains a strong presence in the digital currency space. Currently trading around $151, Solana is a suitable option for those seeking a fast, efficient blockchain with practical applications. 3. Dogecoin (DOGE) Dogecoin (DOGE), initially conceived as a lighthearted project, has become one of the best altcoins due to its dedicated community and increasing real-world applications. Once viewed as a simple meme coin, Dogecoin has gained acceptance as a legitimate payment method, with numerous brands and merchants adopting it. Its low transaction fees and quick processing make it ideal for small transactions and tipping. Support from figures like Elon Musk has contributed to Dogecoin’s continued relevance, with speculation often driving price increases. However, critics point out that its unlimited supply could limit long-term value appreciation. Priced at $0.2105, DOGE remains popular among retail users who appreciate its accessibility, humor, and strong community. Whether for entertainment or potential gains, Dogecoin continues to demonstrate its resilience. 4. Cardano (ADA) Cardano (ADA), currently priced at $0.9538, adopts a scientific approach to blockchain development, prioritizing security, scalability, and sustainability. Its Ouroboros proof-of-stake consensus is recognized for its energy efficiency and network security. Many see Cardano as one of the best altcoins because of its systematic upgrades and commitment to decentralization. A key feature of Cardano is its focus on smart contracts and decentralized finance applications. However, some critics suggest that its development pace is slow, with upgrades taking longer than anticipated. Despite this, Cardano continues to advance with innovations like zero-knowledge smart contracts, which could significantly enhance privacy and scalability. For those seeking a secure, research-driven blockchain, ADA remains a reliable option. Wrapping Up Participants have numerous choices. BlockDAG appeals to those seeking speed, scalability, and substantial growth potential. Solana attracts developers requiring fast transactions with low fees. Dogecoin thrives on community and microtransactions, while Cardano emphasizes a methodical, research-based approach. Each has its strengths, but BlockDAG presents a particularly compelling opportunity. With significant presale gains, an accessible entry price, and an ambitious development plan, it meets many key criteria. For those pursuing advanced features, profitability, or long-term potential, BDAG could be a prime choice among the best altcoins .

While BTC’s price has often floundered towards the end of the week in 2025, the premier cryptocurrency would be hoping to have a different journey over the next few days. Is $90,000 The Next Stop For Bitcoin Price? Fortunately, the future seems bright for the world’s largest cryptocurrency after crypto analyst Ali Martinez took to the X platform to share an exciting bullish prognosis for the Bitcoin price. According to the trader, the price of BTC could be on its way to the psychological $90,000 level. Related Reading: Ethereum Consolidates Since ‘The Big Dump’ – Local Trend Reversal Or Continuation? The rationale behind this positive prediction is the appearance of an ascending triangle pattern on the 1-hour timeframe of the Bitcoin chart. The ascending triangle is a pattern in technical price analysis featuring an inverse right-angled triangle with a horizontal upper boundary (connecting a series of lower highs) and a diagonal rising lower trendline (connecting the swing lows). An ascending triangle formation is usually considered a bullish chart pattern, indicating the continuation of the original upward trend. However, an ascending triangle formation can also serve as a trend reversal pattern and a bearish signal — when the asset’s price breaks down the lower trendline and in the opposite direction of the initial uptrend. As observed in the highlighted chart, the Bitcoin price seems to be breaking out of the triangle pattern through the horizontal upper trendline around $84,000. In his post, Martinez noted that a convincing and sustained close above this level the premier cryptocurrency could make a play for the psychological $90,000 level. The price target for an ascending triangle pattern is determined by adding the vertical distance between the horizontal and rising trendlines to the breakout point. A Bitcoin price leap to $90,000 would represent an almost 7% move from the current price point. As of this writing, the flagship cryptocurrency is valued at around $84,400, reflecting an almost 5% price surge in the past 24 hours. Can Rising Whale Activity Push BTC Price Up? If the Bitcoin price is going to reclaim the $90,000 level, it’s going to need all the buying pressure it can get from investors. Interestingly, the largest class of BTC investors (whales) seem to already be in the party, continuously loading their bags over the past few days. In a separate post on X, Martinez disclosed that whales that own between 1,000 and 10,000 coins have added to their holdings in recent days. Data from Santiment shows this class of whales has acquired 20,000 BTC in the last 24 hours. This high buying activity from Bitcoin whales could offer BTC’s price the necessary bullish impetus to move to $90,000.

The services will be provided through its majority-owned subsidiary, Crypto Finance, which will act as a sub-custodian. Clearstream’s Offering According to a Bloomberg report , Clearstream will offer custody services for Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) to its 2,500 clients starting next month. The company also plans to introduce support for other cryptocurrencies and expand its offerings to include staking, lending, and brokerage capabilities. “With this offering, we are creating a one-stop shop around custody, brokerage, and settlement,” said Jens Hachmeister, head of issuer services and new digital markets at the firm. He also stated that the move would allow it to provide services for assets such as stablecoins and tokenized securities in the future. According to Crypto Finance CEO Stijn Vander Straeten, the organization began planning this service roughly a year ago. The executive added that the strategy would enable banks and large institutions to adopt digital assets more quickly by using familiar technology and compliance tools. Clearstream is one of Europe’s largest clearing houses, with approximately $21.7 billion in assets under management (AUM) as of January this year. Clients of the company’s central securities depository will be able to access crypto custody and settlement services using their existing accounts with Clearstream Banking SA. Growing Demand Under MiCA Traditional financial institutions have been increasing their presence in digital assets in response to regulatory clarity in regions such as the European Union (EU), Singapore, and the United Arab Emirates (UAE). Vander Straeten stated that demand from international banking clients has been “very high” since the Markets in Crypto-Assets Regulation (MiCA) took effect on December 30, 2024. He noted that management firms at these institutions often spend as much as €5 million to build and maintain internal crypto teams. “Here is a chance to have that at zero additional cost,” he said. The latest offering follows a recent milestone in Germany, where Boerse Stuttgart Digital Custody became the first crypto asset service provider in the country to obtain a full MiCA authorization. Under the Europe-wide license, the organization is now a regulated infrastructure provider for banks, brokers, and asset managers. Meanwhile, Spanish bank BBVA SA received regulatory approval on Monday to launch crypto trading services for retail clients. The financial institution plans to initially provide trading services for BTC and ETH through its mobile banking app, with a phased rollout starting with a select group of customers before expanding nationwide.

The leading crypto asset, Bitcoin (BTC), has dropped to $84,423, and Ethereum (ETH) has also slipped to $1,942. This bearish downturn has caused the overall crypto market value to shrink to $2.73 trillion, down from $2.83 trillion last week. NFT sales have also taken a hit , falling to $109.2 million, a 7.84% decline. However, while sales are down, more people are joining the market. Buyers have jumped by almost 700%, and sellers have increased by over 400%. This means more activity is happening, even though the total money spent on NFTs is lower. NFT Sales Drop, But More People Are Buying Ethereum NFT sales dropped 11.28% to $32.7 million. Even so, the number of buyers has more than doubled, showing that interest in NFTs is still strong. Wash trading, where people trade NFTs to fake demand, has also decreased by almost 29%, which suggests that the market is becoming more genuine. Bitcoin NFTs performed better , rising 4.63% to $22.8 million, while other blockchain NFTs had mixed results. Mythos Chain stayed steady at $15 million, and Polygon (POL) grew slightly to $13.8 million. Solana struggled, with sales falling 43.44% to $10.1 million. Courtyard led Solana collections with $12.2 million in sales despite a 33% transaction drop. Top NFT Collections Saw Big Changes Several popular NFT collections also lost value while new ones are gaining attention. DMarket remained strong with $9.8 million in sales. BRC-20 NFTs struggled, dropping by 23.41% to $5.6 million. One of the biggest surprises was Quantum Cats, a new Bitcoin-based NFT collection, which surged by 349.19% to reach $3.9 million in sales. CryptoPunks lost 55.55% of its value and brought in only $3.1 million. The Paradise collection had an even worse week, crashing by 72.58%. Despite declining overall sales, some NFT collectibles still sold for high prices. Two Beeple NFTs were among the most expensive, selling for $464,480 and $441,000. Another NFT from Known Origin went for $390,000. CryptoPunks still had some big sales , with two collections selling for $251,307 and $246,449. What’s Next for NFTs? The Non-Fungible Token market is changing. Even though sales are decreasing, more people still buy and sell digital collectibles. This shows that people are still interested but spending less money. The future of NFTs will depend on the future actions of both Bitcoin and Ethereum. If their prices keep dropping, NFT sales might fall even more. However, the growing number of buyers and sellers could help NFTs recover if the crypto market becomes stable.

Analysts like Egrag Crypto have also alluded to the coin’s historical performance in 2017 as the reason it could enjoy massive gains in this bull run. Insight Into The Crypto’s Current Price Action In an X post, Dark Defender stated that the XRP price is forming Wave 1 on the daily chart. He remarked that he expects the crypto to move towards $2.42 first. The analyst affirmed that the real momentum will start after XRP stands above the Ichimoku clouds. The analyst then highlighted $2.22 and $2.04 as the support levels to watch out for while the targets are $4.2932 and $5.8563. As CoinGape reported, crypto analyst Rose Premium also predicted that XRP could soon reach $5 as BlackRock gears up for ETF filing. Egrag Crypto stated that XRP’s dominance is showing tremendous strength. He noted that the dominance is on the verge of closing above the 2021 high of 6%, surpassing Fib 0.6, which he considers a critical level and a super bullish sign once this close happens. The analyst further remarked that if the dominance successfully closes above Fib 0.5, it could surge straight to Fib 0.888, which is his target of 15 to 20%. He added that this would align with the highs from 2015. It is worth mentioning that the Egrag Crypto previously asserted that XRP will flip Ethereum to become the second-largest crypto by market cap. In another X post, the analyst stated that XRP’s Relative Strength Index (RSI) is steadily ticking upwards and that it is just a matter of time before market participants witness a celestial move. Egrag Crypto also highlighted key RSI targets. He stated that 70 is for bullish confirmation, 77 is for bullish momentum, 85 is for bullish continuation, and 89 is for a parabolic rally for the XRP price.

The maiden cryptocurrency currently trades above $84,000 following its minor recovery in the latter part of last week. However, the continuity of the current bull run remains uncertain barring a sustained uptrend. Related Reading: Bitcoin’s MVRV Ratio Nears Key Level—Will This Trigger a Major Reversal? Bitcoin’s Bullish Chart Pattern Hints At Major Price Surge In an X post on March 14, Egrag Crypto states the BTC market may be preparing for a major price breakout. According to the technical analysis shared by the trading expert, Bitcoin has formed a Cup and Handle pattern hinting a major bullish move is on the horizon. For context, the Cup and Handle pattern represents a textbook bullish formation that occurs when an asset experiences a rounded bottom i.e. the cup followed by a slight pullback i.e. the handle before a breakout to new highs. This is well illustrated in the weekly chart below following BTC’s price action in the past two years. According to Egrag Crypto, the premier cryptocurrency is on the verge of a breakout with multiple potential price targets in sight. The non-logarithmic target presents a conservative possible price peak of $113,000. Meanwhile, the logarithmic scale which accounts for historical exponential gains points to a price target of $260,000. Taking an average of both methods, Egrag Crypto has picked a personal target of $186,000. The analyst also favors a potential price peak at $175,000 as indicated by the Fibonacci extension level of 1.618 which has historically acted as a reliable cycle top indicator. However, while this analysis presents a robust bullish prediction, Bitcoin must first experience a pullback to around $65,000 to initiate this price surge.

Amidst Bitcoin’s larger struggles, IntoTheBlock also reports that exchange inflows grew by $840 million suggesting a weakening market confidence as investors move to sell their assets. At press time, the crypto market leader is valued at $84,545 reflecting a 3.12% gain in the past day. However, reported losses of 1.76% and 13.11% in the past seven and 30 days indicate a dominant bearish influence in recent weeks.

The DOGE token has only been trading at $0.17 so far, even as investors continue to cash out their holdings. The token dropped from its peak in February and could fall even further if selling pressure persists. Miners offloaded over 65 million #Dogecoin $DOGE in just 48 hours! pic.twitter.com/h6zvgAn3W4 — Ali (@ali_charts) March 15, 2025 DOGE miners dump 65 million tokens in two days When miners sell off large amounts of tokens, it’s usually driven by profitability concerns or market pressure from price instability. The Dogecoin token has seen its miners dump 65 million tokens in just two days. Some analysts have even hinted that the token could fall below the $0.15 mark if the selling pressure continues to rise. However, some believe that the token could soon overcome its decline and surge thereafter. For instance, Trader Tardigrade thinks the token could surge if the trend keeps up. He commented, “Dogecoin HUGE Surge is coming.” He added that in previous years, whenever a breakout led to a correction phase, the token would experience a price rise soon after. He insisted that if investors continue to sell their tokens, Dogecoin could hit $1 or even more over the long term. Additionally, analyst ByllifyX believes the token could hit $3 soon. Some even stated that if more buyers come in, the token could spring back above $0.17 in the short term. Historically, when Bitcoin declines, the entire crypto ecosystem is affected, and altcoins like DOGE typically see increased volatility. Bitcoin is trading slightly below $85000, falling from its high of $90000 earlier this month. Some analysts have thus attributed DOGE’s current price action and market state to Bitcoin’s downturn and inflation fears. Musk’s involvement with the Department of Government Efficiency called for investor attention to the DOGE token When Donald Trump announced plans to create a digital asset stockpile, DOGE jumped nearly 20% to $0.24 despite not being listed among the altcoins featured in the stockpile. On Monday, whales purchased 140 million DOGE in just 24 hours. Martinez had even posted that investors had bought up 910 million tokens over the weekend. Some analysts tied the renewed interest in the token to Elon Musk’s involvement with the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE). They argued that the government agency’s use of the same acronyms as the token contributed to the surge in the token. On the Joe Rogan Experience last week, Musk acknowledged the connection between the token and the agency. He claimed that he was going to name the agency the Government Efficiency Commission, which was “very boring.” However, he stated that he followed people’s advice online on the Department of Government Efficiency, which fit perfectly. However, with more miners offloading their holdings, the future of the Dogecoin remains unclear. Cryptopolitan Academy: Want to grow your money in 2025?

According to the latest assessment, XRP is once again approaching key resistance levels and testing critical trend lines. According to the analytics firm, XRP is struggling against the descending trendline and the $2.48 resistance. A successful break above this level could be an early bullish signal. It is crucial to maintain the support range between $2.19 and $2.23 to continue the short-term bullish momentum. Here are the critical areas in the XRP price according to company analysts: $2.48 – $2.65: This is a key resistance zone. A confirmed break above $2.65 could attract more buyers and strengthen the bullish sentiment. $2.80-$3.06: A key resistance area where XRP could face selling pressure. However, if XRP manages to break out sustainably, it would suggest a strong bullish reversal. $2.03: A key support level, if XRP drops back to this price it could signal weakness and a bearish outlook. $1.54 – $1.40: This “Golden Pocket” could act as a target in case of strong selling pressure.

The Hedera (HBAR) price surge has grabbed attention, jumping 10% in a day as speculation over an ETF listing builds momentum. Meanwhile, the Chainlink (LINK) price drop is adding pressure, with the token hovering near the critical $10 mark, raising concerns about further losses. Amid these contrasting moves, BlockDAG (BDAG) stands out. Its successful Halborn audit and an ongoing CertiK review have strengthened its position as one of the most secure projects among popular crypto coins. With a presale that has already raised $202 million and delivered a 2380% price surge, BlockDAG continues to defy expectations. Hedera (HBAR) Price Surge Continues as ETF Speculation Builds The Hedera (HBAR) price surge shows no sign of slowing, climbing 10% in one day to hit $0.2487. This increase comes as talk intensifies over a potential Grayscale Hedera ETF. Some believe this could bring in institutional investors, especially as the SEC evaluates a 19b-4 application for the ETF’s NASDAQ listing. With optimism rising, HBAR’s market cap has surpassed $10.42 billion. The Hedera (HBAR) price surge has been in motion since February 25, delivering a 28% gain so far. If the ETF receives approval, it may give investors a way to gain HBAR exposure without directly holding the token. Chainlink (LINK) Price Drop Raises Concerns Over Falling Below $10 The Chainlink (LINK) price drop has deepened, with LINK slipping under $15 and drawing increased scrutiny. Traders are watching closely as LINK continues its downward trend from previous highs above $30. The token has been forming lower highs and struggling to hold onto key support zones. Attention is now on the $12-$13 range, an area that has historically prevented steeper declines. However, if selling continues, the Chainlink (LINK) price drop could test the $10 psychological barrier. While the Relative Strength Index suggests LINK is nearing oversold territory, it remains uncertain whether a reversal is imminent or if further losses are ahead. BlockDAG’s Halborn Audit Success Sparks Momentum in Presale BlockDAG just checked a major box that many crypto projects overlook—a clean bill of health from Halborn audit . In a space where hacks and exploits are almost expected, this independent validation isn’t just impressive; it’s a game-changer. It confirms what early supporters hoped for: BlockDAG’s infrastructure is built to withstand the kind of vulnerabilities that have toppled other platforms. With the CertiK audit still underway, BlockDAG is doubling down on security, separating itself from the pack. In a market where trust is rare and security failures are common, BlockDAG’s commitment to safeguarding assets is turning heads. Among popular crypto coins, it’s starting to look like one of the few you might actually be able to count on. Security isn’t just a feature—it’s survival. The history of smart contract hacks and data breaches makes it clear: without rock-solid defenses, no project lasts. BlockDAG seems to get that. Its focus on verified security is creating something rare in crypto: stability. And with stability comes growth. That’s why BlockDAG is being talked about as one of the most popular crypto coins to watch. It’s no coincidence that BlockDAG’s Halborn and CertiK audits are fueling a presale that’s smashing through milestones. Over $201 million has already been raised, and more than 18.7 billion BDAG coins have been sold. Since batch 1, when prices were $0.001, BDAG has soared to $0.0248 by batch 27—an eye-watering 2380% increase. Now, the presale’s $600 million target feels less like a long shot and more like the next logical step. Each new batch brings a higher price tag, and the early days of cheap BDAG are fading fast. The pace is relentless, and the hype isn’t slowing down. BlockDAG’s moment is here—and it’s turning into one of those rare opportunities that traders later say they wish they’d jumped on sooner. Key Highlights! The Hedera (HBAR) price surge remains a key focus, with ETF approval potentially unlocking new levels of institutional interest. Meanwhile, the Chainlink (LINK) price drop has placed investors on edge, though there is cautious optimism that support levels may hold. BlockDAG, however, continues to stand apart. Its Halborn audit success and ongoing CertiK review are driving trust, helping it rank high among popular crypto coins . With $202 million raised and prices steadily climbing, BlockDAG’s presale shows no signs of slowing. For traders and buyers, it’s becoming harder to ignore the impact of these developments—and missing out now could prove costly later.

The Ethereum ( ETH )-based virtual reality platform Decentraland ( MANA ) ranks second, clocking 168.93 events, and the Ethereum layer-2 protocol Skale Network ( SKL ) is a distant third with 41.07.

Source: Santiment/X Santiment notes that it doesn’t count routine updates and uses a “better methodology” to collect data for GitHub events based on a “backtested process.” The analytics firm has previously said that heavy development activity centered around a crypto project is a positive indication that could mean that the developers believe the protocol will be successful. It also indicates that the project is less likely to be an exit scam. MultiversX is a distributed, proof-of-stake blockchain network that is decentralized via more than 3,500 nodes. The project aims to help developers build next-gen applications. The project’s native token, EGLD, is trading at $18.10 at time of writing.

Although Shiba Inu (SHIB) loyalists are already dreaming of some 9x in the future, experts are now talking about other coins that can beat such growth up to 2025. Two of the most commonly cited rivals are Toncoin (TON) and Remittix (RTX) with each of them offering something different that has the potential to beat the performance of SHIB. Shiba Inu’s 9x Potential Shiba Inu is still a heavyweight in meme token spheres with approximately 9x growth potential based on various expectations. A changelly analysis of the SHIB future bull run places it at over $0.000032 if the hype never fades and massive burns are maintained. These are expectations founded on the community’s dedication, in addition to improvements such as Shibarium that will continue to lower transaction costs and drive DeFi adoption. Despite such positive signals, some experts are worried about the sheer supply of SHIB. Although over 410 trillion have been burnt out of circulation, 100x potential may be constrained by market limitations. In order for Shiba Inu to double-digitize in the upcoming cycle, it must solidify meaningful utility beyond meme mania. If whales start worrying about diminishing returns, they are going to rotate into more practical altcoins making it easier for coins like Toncoin and Remittix to outpace it. Toncoin Utility Advantage Toncoin stands out for robust tech previously associated with Telegram. TON was constructed as a fast and secure blockchain of the layer-1 variety, optimized for making global-scale transactions with minimal fees. A Benzinga analysis of Toncoin price forecasts puts the token’s price at $10 - $48 in 2025, indicating upside beyond the realm of typical altcoin growth. That excitement is based on TON’s thriving network of dApps linking Telegram groups and broader crypto adoption. TON/USDT Chart. Source: TradingView Since it is a chain with tangible throughput, TON is capable of processing several thousand transactions per second that can be addressed for DeFi and NFT markets. If greater adoption is achieved through mainstream adoption, toncoin’s comparatively minimal market cap can multiply manifold. Even the lower-end projections are around 5x returns, which can outdo the best-case scenario of SHIB if hype for the latter’s meme coin wears off. Toncoin has to stand out in the deluge of smart contract platforms with some special developer tools or bridging Telegram users seamlessly. Remittix Puts Up Remittix has introduced a totally different thinking with emphasis on cross-border finance and applied finance. At $0.0734 price at presale 518 million sold it has raised $13.8 million, indicating confidence of the investors. A cover story of finbold on Remittix for making global remittances explains that diaspora groups would be using Remittix for near-instant and feeless currency exchange. A Philippine farming supplier receiving stablecoins from an Australian importer and exchanging them directly into pesos through a local agent is one of the applications. This simple solution is relief for functional users who are fed up with high bank charges. If pilot transactions in Africa and Southeast Asia ever get off the ground, Remittix may fly past established tokens in terms of growth. Conclusion Optimists are expecting up to 50x within 2025 if the platform is capable of securing major finance deals. PayFi's narrative for the token incorporating crypto into everyday transactions resonates with those searching for practical uses rather than speculation. Their investors appreciate that real-world utility can protect RTX from the volatility that is so typical of meme coins. Presale hype suggests that Remittix would attract significant liquidity once listed. Gains would be on the strength of gaining ties with major remittance operators or e-wallets, which would boost volumes and token demand. If the diaspora adoption continues to build momentum, the rise of the coin may even surpass the 9x potential of SHIB and Remittix would be one of the leaders for huge returns. Shiba Inu targets niche groups for memes, TON bets on blockchain superiority and RTX attacks cross-border inefficiencies directly. Shiba Inu may even have the potential to provide 9x while TON's forays into DeFi and Remittix's PayFi drives can provide such returns more safely especially as mainstream adoption begins to pick up speed. Ultimately, the best fit depends on risk appetite as well as faith in practical applications vs brand-fueled mania. Interested in learning about this remittance-based altcoin that could outgrow SHIB's development? Take a look at Remittix and find out how connecting crypto and day-to-day payments can bring higher returns than meme or brand-based hype.

Mixed Signals From Key Indicators Raise Questions!,https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2025/03/can-ethereum-eth-still-shine-in-2025-mixed-signals-from-key-indicators-raise-questions,"Deeper into 2025, the attitude toward ETH is mixed; vital facts point to both good and negative possibilities. Although some experts believe Ethereum is primed for a recovery, others argue on whether the asset may still show significant increases this year since technical indicators point to a likely decline. Meanwhile, Remittix , is poised to completely reimagine modern cross-border transactions with its exclusive crypto-to-fiat conversion technology. Read on to learn more. Ethereum’s Technical Indicators Show Warning Signs Ethereum fell below the critical $2,000 psychological level for the first time since December 2023, raising concerns amongst investors. ETH has subsequently risen above this level, however the most recent pricing action signals to still strong bearish pressure. Early 2025 performance of the asset has been particularly concerning as ETH revealed negative monthly closures in January and February a pattern not seen in its history. Analyst Ali Martinez said Ethereum would potentially collapse to lower levels, falling to $1,600 or perhaps $1,200. Based on Ethereum dropping below the bottom limit of a parallel channel, his analysis suggests that additional downside could be set to hit. This aligns with certain traders' concerns, like those who believe Ethereum won't show a noteworthy return until it gathers major momentum. While some experts have a negative opinion, others believe Ethereum could have already peaked. Based on what he believes to be the most important point of interest for a price reversal, crypto analyst Titan of Crypto recently informed that ETH has reached a notable level of support. Based on ETH's daily chart, which shows that the low for 2024 has been wiped, his analysis indicates that an upward trend might be created. As of now, Ethereum is trading at around about $1,928 ; over 24 hours, it has increased over 1.46%. Though the future is unclear, institutional adoption and more broad market movements will decide the long-term prospects of the asset. Remittix is attracting interest for its optimistic future whereas Ethereum's is unknown. Remittix Is Poised For A Massive Rally Providing rapid and competitively priced cross-border solutions, Remittix (RTX) is reinventing global payments by combining FIAT transactions with blockchain technology. Remitix is the superior substitute for traditional payment companies like Stripe and Wise. By supporting over 50 crypto pairings and 30+ FIAT currencies, both crypto-exclusive platforms like Coinbase Wallet and Remittix offer accessibility and inclusiveness for enterprises and consumers, thereby simplifying global commerce. Notable also is the open flat-fee strategy of the platform, which provides savings and openness over ridiculous rates of exchange of traditional banks. Remittix is groundbreaking in the payments sector as it ensures that the whole amount sent reaches the receiver. Why $RTX Is A Good Investment The RTX currency has a good investment potential at $0.0734 at the presale stage. Forecasts show an intriguing surge; demand for creative cross-border payment solutions is creating a 25x multiplier in the presale period and over 1,500% rises post launch.

Elsewhere, Shiba Inu (SHIB) investors are gearing up for potential losses as investor sentiment takes a hit. While XRP remains the sector leader, some traders are discovering their way to another viral token that is gaining momentum fast. One such project that is attracting tremendous eyeballs is Remittix (RTX) . XRP and SHIB are bankrolled on institutional adoption and meme coin momentum. RTX, on the other hand, is trying to address practical financial problems. With crypto transactions gaining mainstream acceptance like never before, investors are wondering if and when RTX might surpass XRP and SHIB in the long term. XRP Gains Strength as Market Confidence Grows XRP has risen around 2.78% in the last 24 hours to trade at around $2.44. Even as the price has been increasing, the volume of XRP is down 3.76% at $4.63 billion as traders remain indecisive. With XRP making more financial deals, it is likely to grow according to most investors. There are some traders who are less confident, nevertheless, as the long-term fate of XRP relies so significantly on regulatory progress and whether it can become more mainstream into existing banks. Even as XRP’s payment network remains solid, some investors are looking for options such as RTX that offer quicker and more accessible financial services for consumers and enterprises. Shiba Inu (SHIB) Faces Growing Uncertainty Shiba Inu has risen around 1% in the past 24 hours and is now trading at around $0.00001283. Its volume decreased by 15.80% to $155.19 million as the hype for SHIB is fading away. While the development of SHIB’s ecosystem, like Shibarium and DeFi integrations, has helped sustain investor interest, the challenge from newer projects is growing. Meme coins find long-term viability difficult and SHIB will need more than community hype in order to remain relevant. SHIB investors looking for diversification are finding their way into RTX as it stands as a payment-centric crypto with stronger long-term growth fundamentals than meme coins. Remittix (RTX): The Payments Token Gaining Momentum Remittix (RTX) is gaining momentum as one of the major players in the blockchain payment market with zero-fee crypto-to-fiat transfers. At $0.0734, more than $13.8 million has been raised and 518 million tokens have been sold as of now, reflecting strong early investor demand. Unlike XRP for banks and institutions and SHIB as token -based on meme currencies, RTX is for individuals, freelancers and businesses that need frictionless payment. A businessman in Asia accepting payment from America can settle crypto into fiat immediately with the help of RTX and eliminate high bank fees and exchange rates. By means of PayFi platform, RTX is positioning itself as one of the most practical cryptocurrencies in the payment industry with genuine financial solutions and not speculation. Which Crypto Holds the Most Long-Term Potential? Traders are pitting XRP, SHIB and RTX against one another with one question in mind: which token holds the most long-term investment potential? XRP dominates bank transactions but remains uncertain until regulatory clarification. It has bank and other institution allies behind it for its use case but regulatory risk may smother adoption. SHIB is dependent on popular sentiment and meme strength, but it cannot be sustained in the long term. With no continued ecosystem growth and practical uses in the real world, SHIB’s price cannot be supported beyond speculation. RTX, meanwhile, is emerging as a serious rival with a workable financial thesis. Unlike XRP, which relies on institutional support, and SHIB, which rides on hype, RTX is providing fee-less, frictionless crypto-to-fiat payments that businesses, freelancers and cross-border traders find attractive. Invest in the Future of Blockchain Payments with Remittix (RTX) While XRP is seeing capital inflows and SHIB is languishing due to market uncertainty, RTX is emerging as a high-growth option. Its real-world use case, inexpensive transaction costs and seamless payment model make it a great pick in blockchain finance. Consider investing in one with practical uses in everyday life Go to the Remittix presale and learn why RTX can surpass XRP and SHIB in 2025.

Hedera and Mantra are pushing boundaries, aiming for top billing. Both have unique offerings and growing communities. Insights into their strategies and potential growth are poised to captivate readers eager to discover the leading contenders. Who has the upper hand? Dig in to find out. Hedera HBAR: Strong 6-Month Rise Contrasts with Recent Decline Hedera ’s price dropped by 16.48% over the past month, while a 294.50% rise over the last six months highlights a dramatic long-term gain. The coin has experienced a notable short-term contraction against a strong upward backdrop seen in its half-year performance. This mix of swift declines and robust rallies presents a dynamic history that calls attention to potential reversion opportunities. Current prices range between $0.1551 and $0.2923, with immediate resistance at $0.37 and support near $0.0967. Bears dominate the near term as momentum and oscillator indicators trend negative, suggesting trades focused on buying dips with a watchful eye on the initial resistance levels. MANTRA Market Pulse: Key Levels and Price Action The coin's price rose by nearly 10% over the past month, while the impressive six-month gain reached almost 494%. This substantial long-term increase highlights strong interest, despite a minor pullback of over 3% in recent weeks. The price history demonstrates consistent upward movement interspersed with short-term corrections, reflecting healthy fluctuations and investor engagement. Currently, the price fluctuates between $4.90 and $9.67, with support located around$ 2.26 and resistance at approximately $11.81. Bearish sentiment is present, along with a neutral RSI of 44.23, indicating a market lacking a definitive trend. Traders may find value in buying near support and exercising caution with exits near resistance during this active altcoin season. Conclusion Hedera (HBAR) and Mantra (OM) are competing for RWA crypto leadership in Q2. HBAR stands out with its innovative technology and governance model. OM attracts interest with its focus on decentralized finance services. Both coins have strong points and unique advantages. The market will decide which one gains the upper hand. For now, they both present compelling opportunities. Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

41726900,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=712832,1742086822,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/21/41726900.jpeg,Ethereum Price Nears Critical 100-Day SMA – Will It Break Through?,https://www.newsbtc.com/news/ethereum/ethereum-nears-100-day-sma/,"Ethereum (ETH) has been on a slow and steady upward trajectory, inching closer to a crucial technical indicator: the 100-day Simple Moving Average (SMA). This level is more than just a line on a chart—it’s a key battleground for bulls and bears, often dictating the next major move. As ETH approaches this critical resistance, speculations on whether this could catalyze a sustained rally or a stumbling block that triggers a pullback arise. The 100-day SMA is a widely followed indicator that reflects the medium-term trend, and its significance cannot be overstated. For Ethereum, breaking above this level could reignite bullish sentiment, paving the way for higher price targets. On the flip side, a rejection might lead to further consolidation or even a retest of lower support levels Ethereum Price Struggles: Can Bulls Gain Momentum? Ethereum has been facing a tough battle as it slowly climbs toward the 100-day SMA. Despite attempts at recovery, the price has struggled to gain strong upside movement, with resistance levels capping its moves. Buyers have shown interest at key support zones, preventing further declines, but a lack of sustained volume and conviction has kept ETH from breaking higher. Related Reading: Ethereum Price Recovery Capped—Bulls Struggle Near Resistance The MACD indicator hints at a potential momentum shift in Ethereum’s price action. While the MACD and signal lines have crossed and are approaching the zero line, a confirmed bullish crossover is still lacking. Additionally, the narrowing histogram suggests a transition from bearish to neutral or bullish, but further confirmation is needed for a sustained upward move. For Ethereum to sustain a bullish move, the MACD line and signal line need to rise above average, accompanied by expanding histogram bars in the positive zone. If this occurs, it could strengthen upward momentum. However, failure to achieve a breakout leaves Ethereum vulnerable to consolidation or a downside move. What A Successful Breakout Means A breakout above the 100-day SMA would serve as a strong bullish confirmation for Ethereum, signaling renewed upward momentum and shifting market sentiment in favor of buyers. This move would suggest that Ethereum has overcome a key technical barrier, potentially attracting more investors and traders looking to capitalize on the uptrend. Related Reading: Ethereum Gained 160% The Last Time This On-Chain Indicator Flashed – Will ETH Soar Again? Ethereum could set its sights on the $2,160 resistance level if the breakout is sustained with increased volume and strong follow-through. A successful push above this level may increase the likelihood of more price appreciation toward other resistance levels, such as $2,858 and $3,360. However, if Ethereum fails to achieve a breakout above the key resistance level, it could face renewed selling pressure, leading to a fresh decline toward the $1,523 support zone. This level has historically acted as a key demand area, where buyers might attempt to prevent further downside.

Polymarket reported that Carney’s odds of winning the next federal election scheduled for October 20, 2025, had increased by 23% up to 49% from 26% last month. On the other hand, the odds of the current leader of the official opposition and the leader of the Conservative Party, Pierre Poilievre, had decreased by 21% from 72% in February to 51%. Carney’s expertise in business qualifies him to navigate Canada’s economic challenges Recently, Carney was elected leader of the Liberal Party, replacing Justin Trudeau, during ongoing historical tension and growing fears of a trade war with the U.S. under Trump’s administration. This is his first time getting involved in Canadian politics at the highest level, and a federal election is coming. On Sunday, after securing 85.9% of the vote on the first ballot, he said, “I will work day and night with one purpose, which is to build a stronger Canada for everyone.” Concerning the U.S.-Canada trade war, President Donald Trump imposed tariffs on Canada’s imports, potentially sparking a trade war. Based on Ontario, Canada, placing a 25% Tariff on ‘Electricity’ coming into the United States, Trump instructed his Secretary of Commerce to add an additional 25% tariff, to 50%, on all steel and aluminium coming into the United States from Canada, one of the highest tariffing nations anywhere in the world. Ontario’s premier, Doug Ford, threatened to shut off the US electricity supply entirely. Mark Carney said he would continue to pressure America in response to Trump’s tariff actions. “My government will keep our tariffs on until the Americans show us respect and make credible, reliable commitments to free and fair trade,” he said in a post on X. White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt said on Tuesday that Trump has yet to speak with Carney but that “his phone is always open to leaders who wish to speak with him.” Following these developments, Canadians preferred Carney over Poilievre due to his business expertise and being a former central banker. Poilievre’s support for Bitcoin and ownership of a Canadian-issued Bitcoin ETF had not been a major focus of the Canadian campaign. The Canadian federal election scheduled for October 20, 2025, could be called sooner The next federal election is scheduled for 20 October 2025. However, it might occur earlier due to certain circumstances, including when the government general accepts the prime minister’s resignation after the government is defeated in a confidence vote in parliament or when it accepts his advice to dissolve the government. Pierre Poilievre and the leader of the New Democratic Party, Jagmeet Singh, have already declared they will call for a vote of no confidence after parliament resumes. With Carney’s record still fresh and tensions with the U.S. rising, the next election—whenever it happens—will be a test of whether his economic acumen and aspirations for Canada can earn him a long-term mandate. At the same time, Poilievre and Singh’s pressure for an early election indicates the opposition believes it has a window of opportunity to challenge Carney before he settles into the role.

For PI to triple by the end of March 2025, it would need to reach around $5.55, within a two-week timeframe. Here are key potential PI market catalysts and insights to watch as the month unfolds. Current Pi Network Price Trends Recent analysis reveals that PI has undergone significant volatility. After reaching a high of $3.01 last week, the price has dropped by over 40%, reflecting a typical boom-and-bust cycle common in emerging cryptocurrencies. However, recent bullish momentum across the broader crypto market, following favourable U.S. CPI and PPI reports, has reignited interest in digital assets, including PI. Volume analysis further supports the possibility of a price rebound. Over the past 72 hours, trading volume has steadily increased, signalling renewed market interest. Rising volume typically indicates strong buying pressure, reinforcing the probability of a short-term price breakout. Why is PI Network Price Going Up? One of the biggest driving factors behind PI’s price action is speculation regarding a potential Binance listing. Over the past few months, PI has secured listings on CoinGecko, CoinMarketCap, and other major price-tracking platforms. These listings have boosted awareness, leading to increased demand. PI Network Price Action, March 15 | CoinMarketCap As depicted above, PI currently ranks 11 largest cryptocurrency network by market cap, surpassing $10.5 billion at the time of writing. Many traders and analysts believe that PI remains undervalued due to its absence from Binance, the world’s largest crypto exchange. If PI listing on Binance materialises in March, it could trigger substantial inflows from institutional and retail investors. PI Network Price Projections 2025 According to CoinMarketCap insights, PI has the potential to cross the $50 mark in 2025. Meanwhile, CoinCodex offers a more conservative projection, forecasting a 101.79% increase, which would push PI to $5.64. While these forecasts highlight PI’s upside potential, strategic traders remain aware of the broader market risks. PI Network Price Prediction, 2025 | CoinMarketCap With altcoin ETFs dominating crypto market discourse, there’s a real possibility that an approval verdict from the U.S. SEC could divert investor attention and liquidity away from PI. Assets like XRP, SOL, and ADA—each with ongoing ETF filings —could see increased institutional inflows, potentially draining PI spot demand. Binance Listing Could Spark a Parabolic Rally Having already secured listings on major crypto exchanges Bitget and OKX , the potential Binance listing would place PI in the spotlight, dramatically increasing demand. If the listing materializes in March 2025, A confirmed Binance listing could act as a game-changer for PI. Several key factors could contribute to a parabolic rally: Exchange Liquidity: Binance’s deep liquidity and global reach could significantly enhance PI’s trading volume, increasing price stability and reducing volatility during rallies. Ecosystem Expansion: Exchange listings often attract new partnerships, institutional investors, and developers, leading to broader adoption. In essence, if PI Network’s listing on Binance materialises, PI’s chances of reaching $5.55 would increase significantly. PI Network Technical Analysis: $4.5 Breakout Could Validate Triple Gains Forecast For PI to triple from $1.49 to $4.47-$5.55, it must first clear several key resistance levels: $1.58 (Middle Bollinger Band): A move above this level signals a bullish trend shift. $1.91 (Upper Bollinger Band): Breaking this resistance confirms upward momentum. $2.50 (Historical Resistance): Historically significant level that has posed a major barrier to previous rallies. $3.00 (Psychological Resistance): A surge past $3.00 milestone price level would reinforce a move toward $4.50-$5.55. PI Network Price Forecast However, failure to hold $1.25 (Lower Bollinger Band) or a breakdown below $1.00 could delay or invalidate bullish projections.

Due to this, most altcoins in the market recorded major declines, with some registering yearly lows. However, trade-war tensions and inflation in the US plunges, there’s a renewed buying interest in the altcoin market. As a result, we might see a strong recovery rally in altcoin prices next week, specifically Pi coin, Pepe meme coin and Binance coin (BNB). Altcoins Gain Spotlight Amid Bitcoin’s $85K Struggle Over the past week, the crypto market experienced significant volatility due to geopolitical tensions. As the market began to rebound, attention shifted towards altcoins. Additionally, Bitcoin’s recent difficulties in surpassing the $85K threshold have resulted in a decrease in its market dominance. This has attracted whale investors, who have been actively accumulating altcoins such as Pi, Pepe, and Binance Coin (BNB) during this period. Pi Coin Price Analysis The Pi coin price is currently facing resistance at the critical $1.5 threshold, with sellers exerting increasing pressure. As a result, the price is consolidating just below the EMA20 trend line. At present, Pi coin is trading at $1.45, having declined by over 4.5% in the last 24 hours. The PI/USDT pair is finding it challenging to reach the immediate resistance at $1.5, a level that could prove strong as short-term holders may choose to liquidate their positions at this point. Nevertheless, there is potential for buyers to overcome this barrier if demand strengthens. Should the price remain under the EMA20 trend line on the 1-hour chart, it is likely that sellers will attempt to drive it down to $1.38. A further decline from there could cement the sellers’ control, potentially lowering the price to $1.26. Conversely, with the Relative Strength Index (RSI) persisting below the midline at 40, there could be an opportunity for a retest of the resistance channel. Should the price sustain above $1.5, it would signal a shift in favor of the buyers, potentially leading to an increase up to $1.8. Pepecoin Price Analysis Pepe’s price has been edging upwards, targeting a breakthrough above the 23.6% Fibonacci retracement level, despite strong resistance from bears on the price chart. Currently, the PEPE/USDT pair encounters resistance near $0.0000075, a level where bearish sentiments tend to intensify. Yet, with the Relative Strength Index (RSI) at 57 and residing within the buying territory, there is potential for Pepe to achieve a breakout. The coin is approaching a critical test at the $0.0000075 mark, and surpassing this resistance could pave the way towards $0.000009. Conversely, increased selling pressure at these resistance points could halt any potential gains. If Pepe is unable to overcome the $0.0000075 hurdle, there’s a possibility that its price could retreat to approximately $0.000006. Binance Coin (BNB) Price Analysis Binance Coin (BNB) is currently seeing a surge in buying activity, pushing its price above the crucial $610 resistance. Currently, BNB is trading at $614, reflecting a 5% gain over the last 24 hours. On the trading charts, the BNB/USDT pair is rising exponentially above the EMA trend lines, which might lead to a break above another resistance. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) is at 78, which places BNB within the overbought region, indicating an upcoming correction. However, if BNB holds its current momentum, we might see a skyrocketing trend toward $676. On the downside, if sellers gain the upper hand, BNB could retreat to the important support level at EMA20. Should it break below this level, it may trigger a steep drop to $563, marking a significant move from the current bullish momentum.",Price Analysis|Altcoins|Bitcoin|Ethereum|Ripple (XRP),EN,0,0,BNB|TRADING|MARKET|ALTCOIN|EXCHANGE,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-03-16 01:30:00

Despite this price recovery, the heavy market corrections in recent weeks have drawn intense doubts about the viability of the current bull run. Interestingly, on-chain analytics firm IntoTheBlock believes the market peak may have yet to occur based on historical data. Related Reading: Bitcoin Funding Rate Turns Negative For The 7th Time in a Year – Every Previous Drop Led To Gains Bitcoin Halving Cycles Reveal Diminishing Returns But Market Could Peak By 150% In its most recent weekly newsletter , IntoTheBlock analysts have explored historical metrics to evaluate the current status of the Bitcoin market. Notably, this insightful report indicates that BTC is still far from its projected returns based on previous cycles, suggesting the crypto bull run is potentially active.According to IntoTheBlock, Bitcoin has continuously experienced a decline in post-halving returns with each subsequent cycle yielding lower peak gains compared to its predecessors. The halving is a crucial blockchain event during the block reward for Bitcoin miners is reduced by half, thereby slowing the release of new tokens to maintain scarcity. The halving occurs every four years and is a major checkpoint in the market cycle. Following the first halving in November 2012, the Bitcoin market recorded staggering market gains peaking at around 6,000% – 8,000% before finding stability at around 1,600% – 4,000%.The market surge post-second halving was notably still strong reaching around 2,000% and settling at 600%. After the third halving in May 2020, BTC experienced some modest gains not more than 600%. Clearly, the BTC market displays a diminishing returns pattern following successive halving, which suggests the premier cryptocurrency’s growth potential tends to reduce alongside price growth. This trend is characteristic of a market reaching maturation as Bitcoin now ranks as the eighth largest asset in the world. Presently, the current Bitcoin cycle has only reached peak gains of 60% post-halving. While this fourth cycle is expected to maintain the pattern of diminishing returns, IntoTheBlock analysts are projecting maximum market gains between 50%-150%, indicating more room for price growth at the moment. BTC Price Peak To Come In H2 2025? According to more analysis from IntoTheBlock, Bitcoin is shown to typically attain its market peak 12-18 months post-halving. Following this pattern, the premier cryptocurrency is expected to experience some significant appreciation between mid-2025 to late 2025. However, it is worth noting that market conditions are currently different especially considering the growth of institutional interest and the recent tariff policies of the US government. At the time of writing, Bitcoin trades at $84,391, reflecting a decline of 1.64% in the past seven days.",Bitcoin|bitcoin|Bitcoin bullish predictions|Bitcoin Halving|btcusd|BTCUSDT|IntoTheBlock,EN,0,0,INJ|ETH|ASIA|ALTCOIN|HNT|MARKET|SHIB|BNB|EXCHANGE|BTC|REGULATION|TRADING|OTHER|DOGE|SOL|BLOCKCHAIN|XRP|TON|BUSINESS|FIAT|BONK|PYUSD|COMMODITY|ADA|ZRX|MINING|FTT|DOT|USDT|RESEARCH|FORKS|IMX|ICP|TRX|TECHNOLOGY|ARB|WLD|SPONSORED|RAY|SUI|PEPE|WALLET|UNI|XMR|LINK|NEAR|SEI|MATIC|ARKM|USDC|LTC|LUNA|AIRDROP|BTG|MX|TOKEN SALE|BSV|FLOKI|TOKEN LISTING AND DELISTING|BITTENSOR|HBAR|CRO|WIF|ZEC|MEME|MOG|APE|JUP|AAVE|ONDO|XTZ|BGB|LUNC|XLM|APT|ZK|MANA|AR|AGX|FET|AXS|ADMINISTRATIVE EVENTS|XDC|BCH|MNT|FIL|AVAX|LDO|SSV|ETHFI|ETC|RUNE|FDUSD,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-03-16 01:30:17

The presale has raised more than 3.4 million USD from 5,700 holders attracted to its structured lending model and growth-incentive mechanisms in underwrites. Analysts believe MUTM is uniquely positioned for huge gains, due to these factors coming together at once: rising buy pressure, smart tokenomics and real-world usage. Current participants can guarantee a 25% gain as compared to the projected $0.025 token price from Phase 4, which closes before any exchange listings would begin. Presale Momentum Builds Phase 3 is well ahead of where it should have been, as time is running out for investors to get on board with the final opportunity to purchase MUTM at $0.02. Early backers are already looking at a guaranteed 200% return at launch, with the 25% price increase for the next stage a sign of urgency ahead of a listing price of $0.06. This boom is not some kind of speculation: Mutuum Finance (MUTM) integrates purchase pressure straight into its ecosystem. A part of platform revenue is swapped for MUTM on the market automatically and redistributed to stakers and liquidity providers. This system keeps demand inflows flowing while also acting as a deterrent to sell-offs, creating a self-perpetuating cycle that analysts expect to send prices far beyond projected initial targets. ROI Projections Spark Interest Outside of the presale, predictions for Mutuum Finance (MUTM) become increasingly removed. Even in the most conservative estimates, a post-launch valuation of $3.50/token gives a 17,400% increase compared to the latest Phase 3 price. Such predictions are based on its hybrid DeFi solution, incorporating overcollateralized loans, peer-to-peer lending w/ yield generating mtTokens. Unlike meme coins or speculative assets, MUTM is a utility token that derives its value from platform usage. With increasing borrowing activity comes increasing revenue allocated to token buybacks, which forms a feedback loop further rewarding long-term holders. Mechanics of Innovation Further Prosper Another aspect that sets Mutuum Finance (MUTM) apart is the introduction of mtTokens, deposit certificates that accumulate interest over time. Users who provide assets, such as ETH or USDC, into the protocol receive mtTokens which accrue value over time, and can be redeemed for the amount equivalent of the underlying collateral + profit. These tokens can also move across DeFi platforms, increasing their utility use case outside of Mutuum’s environment. In addition to this, a $100,000 presale giveaway encouraging early involvement means the project marries short-term incentives with long-term sustainability. Security Improvements in Progress With excitement brewing, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is preparing a smart contract audit by Certik, one of the leading blockchain security companies. Results are anticipated in the coming hours/days and will confirm that a protocol is robust while safeguarding protocol investor assets. Such advances — which are uncommon among presale projects — indicate the team’s dedication to transparency and reliability, thereby setting MUTM even further apart in a competitive crypto marketplace. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is not simply following market trends, it’s creating them. As Phase 3 quickly fills and exchange listings are drawing near, the window to get your tokens at $0.02 is closing. In addition, strong presale projects leveraging similar mechanics have previously exceeded conservative targets by wide margins, and the tangible utility of MUTM serves to compound this potential. For those investors looking for bankable assets based on real world utility and not simply on hype, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) emerges as a unicorn. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) awake to the ticking of the clock on Phase 3. New entrants crystallize a 25% gain as Phase 4 fires up, plus will gain mega-multiples in gains after launch. Presale details and audit updates will be available on Mutuum Finance’s official channels..

Each year, select digital assets emerge prominently, demonstrating their resilience and potential. Currently, several names are drawing notable attention: BlockDAG (BDAG), Arbitrum (ARB), Filecoin (FIL), and Hedera (HBAR). These aren’t mere trends; they are supported by solid foundations, increasing use, and significant forthcoming events. If you’re scouting for the most popular crypto with substantial momentum, these four are worth a detailed look. With significant developments expected soon, the real question is not if they will rise, but rather how high they will soar. 1. BlockDAG (BDAG): Poised for Major Growth This Year! BlockDAG (BDAG) is on track to be one of the biggest, most popular cryptos of the year, bolstered by significant forthcoming events. Anticipated for a mainnet launch in 2025 and slated for listing on 10 major exchanges, BDAG is poised for substantial market visibility. The initiative has already amassed over $202.5 million in its presale phase, with early participants experiencing a 2380% return on their initial commitment—a testament to its potential. Unlike many cryptos that diminish post-launch, BDAG is crafted for practical application, featuring rapid, scalable transactions that position it as a preferred Layer 1 blockchain. Analysts predict a potential $1 price target for the BDAG coin in 2025, a dramatic increase from its current Batch 27 price of just $0.0248. With rising demand, imminent listings, and increasing momentum, BDAG stands out as a prudent choice in the crypto sphere right now. 2. Arbitrum (ARB): Enhancing Ethereum’s DeFi Capabilities Arbitrum (ARB) boosts Ethereum’s performance by offering a more rapid and cost-effective Layer 2 solution. By implementing optimistic rollups, it handles transactions off-chain before finalizing them on Ethereum, greatly reducing congestion and fees. This has led to its adoption by prominent DeFi platforms, enhancing their scalability smoothly. ARB is presently priced at $0.42, indicating consistent market activity. With ongoing enhancements to Ethereum and growing interest from institutions, this most popular crypto is poised for sustained growth and is becoming integral to decentralized finance. 3. Filecoin (FIL): Pioneering Decentralized Data Storage Filecoin (FIL) is transforming digital storage by offering a decentralized alternative to conventional cloud services. It enables users to offer unused storage space, thereby creating a secure and efficient marketplace for data storage and retrieval. This model reduces dependence on centralized entities, boosting privacy and accessibility. Currently, FIL’s price stands at $2.98, marking a 6.40% drop over the past day. Nevertheless, with increasing adoption of Web3 and rising demand for decentralized services, this most popular crypto is set to become a key player in future data storage solutions. 4. Hedera (HBAR): Streamlining Blockchain for Enterprises Hedera (HBAR) tackles the challenges of speed and scalability using its Hashgraph consensus mechanism, which allows for parallel transaction processing, thus enhancing speed and security. This capability has attracted major corporations like Google, IBM, and Boeing to adopt Hedera’s technology. As of March 6, 2025, HBAR’s trading price is approximately $0.249, down by 2.75% in the last 24 hours. With its strong performance and increasing corporate use, Hedera is establishing itself as one of the most popular cryptos in the blockchain industry. Final Thoughts on Most Popular Cryptos The crypto market is crowded, and standing out requires more than hype. Arbitrum is streamlining Ethereum’s efficiency, Filecoin is revolutionizing decentralized storage, and Hedera is integrating blockchain into large enterprises. Yet, BlockDAG leads the pack for compelling reasons: its growth trajectory is remarkable. Anticipated for a mainnet launch and slated for listing on 10 major exchanges, along with a presale already showing 2380% growth, BDAG is demonstrating substantial potential. With a price target of $1 from a current price of just $0.0248, BDAG is set to be the leading most popular crypto of the year!

Yakovenko argues that failing fast will do more for Solana than a slew of proposal approvals. Solana Governance Has To Prioritize Speed And Incisiveness Solana co-founder Anatoly Yakovenko has moved on from the community’s rejection of the Solana Improvement Document (SIMD)-0228. Yakovenko noted that despite the failed proposal, the speed of governance proceedings for Solana left an impressive mark. The SIMD-0228 sought to change Solana’s tokenomics by introducing a dynamic inflation model, moving away from the network’s fixed inflation schedule. While the proposal split the network over centralization fears and disadvantages to smaller validators, Yakovenko highlighted the silver lining in its rejection. Learning from the proposal, the Solana cofounder disclosed that the network’s governance must be “fast and decisive.” For Yakovenko, the quick resolution of the proposal frees up resources for the network to explore a better approach. “How fast the ecosystem iterates is a thousand times more important than making sure that every proposal passes,” said Yakovenko. Over 74% of validators participated in the vote with Yakovenko declaring support for the proposal. Big ecosystem players including VanEck supported the proposal amid speculation that Solana price will spike following the approval. Bulls Eye Upward Movement For SOL Price Despite the rejection of the proposal, bulls are still clinging to hope that SOL can go on a parabolic rally. The network has faced significant downward pressure in recent weeks, complicated by Alameda’s SOL unstaking . A steep drop in Solana DEX volume darkens the cloud for the future of the asset’s price. However, analysts are keeping their eyes on the potential repeat of a 2021 pattern that can send SOL price to $4,000. There is speculation that Solana is on course to surpass Ethereum’s market capitalization. Optimist are hinging their prediction on on-chain metrics and the soaring number of projects building on the network.

Every week, new projects emerge, promising the next big breakthrough in the space. For 2025, three coins are really standing out: Qubetics ($TICS), Cosmos (ATOM), and Ondo (ONDO). Each one is bringing something unique to the table, but which one should grab your attention this week? Well, keep reading to find out which one could be the best crypto to buy this week and why. The latest buzz in the crypto market has centered around Qubetics, especially with its presale reaching an impressive milestone. At the same time, Cosmos continues to prove itself as a heavy hitter in the blockchain world, providing scalability and interconnectivity that could potentially change how decentralized networks communicate. Ondo, on the other hand, is drawing interest for its focus on privacy and security in the DeFi sector. With all these exciting developments, it’s tough to pick just one—but that’s what this guide is for: helping make the best choice for this week’s best crypto to buy. Qubetics, however, might just be the project to watch. It’s tackling cross-border transactions like no other, helping businesses and individuals simplify international payments and financial transfers. With its unique features, it’s positioning itself to fill gaps that others have left wide open. Now, let’s dive into each of these projects and explore what makes them stand out in 2025. Qubetics ($TICS) – The New Era of Cross-Border Transactions Qubetics is shaking things up, and for a good reason. It’s in the 25th stage of its crypto presale , and the buzz around its potential is palpable. With over 499 million tokens sold to more than 23,000 holders, raising an impressive $15 million, $TICS is gaining traction. But what’s even more exciting is how Qubetics is positioning itself as the go-to crypto for easier cross-border transactions. This is especially important as the world becomes increasingly globalized, and businesses and individuals alike need to move money faster, cheaper, and more securely across borders. The way Qubetics approaches cross-border transactions is a game-changer. Traditional systems for transferring money across borders are often slow, expensive, and can be filled with hidden fees. With Qubetics, all of that changes. Thanks to the blockchain’s inherent transparency and security, businesses, professionals, and individuals can send and receive payments across borders with ease. Imagine not having to wait days for a wire transfer or dealing with sky-high fees just to move money between countries. With $TICS, these transactions become seamless, faster, and much more affordable. Qubetics Presale: Massive ROI Potential for Early Buyers Current $TICS token price: $0.1074 during presale Analysts predict a rise to $0.25 after presale, offering a 132% ROI If $TICS hits $1 post-presale, that’s an 830% ROI Predictions of $5 to $15 per token after mainnet launch, equating to up to 15,255% ROI Significant growth potential with the ongoing presale! Qubetics isn’t just another crypto—it’s a potential solution to one of the biggest pain points in finance today. As cross-border transactions continue to become more and more essential, Qubetics is positioning itself as the solution businesses and individuals have been waiting for. The ongoing presale is an exciting opportunity, and this could very well be the best crypto to buy this week for those looking for both growth and practicality in the crypto space. Cosmos (ATOM) – The Internet of Blockchains Cosmos is like the glue that holds the blockchain world together. While many projects are focused on building individual, isolated networks, Cosmos is taking a different approach. It’s creating an ecosystem where different blockchains can communicate and work together, which is a big deal in a space that often feels fragmented. By using the Cosmos SDK, developers can build their own blockchain while also tapping into the wider Cosmos ecosystem, making it easier for various decentralized networks to share data and value. What makes Cosmos stand out this week as one of the best cryptos to buy is its focus on scalability and interoperability. As more and more projects come online, the ability for these projects to talk to each other becomes increasingly important. Cosmos has set itself up to be the connector for these different chains, solving one of the biggest issues that’s been holding back blockchain adoption: communication between networks. This opens up a whole new world of possibilities for decentralized finance (DeFi), supply chain management, healthcare data sharing, and so much more. Since its launch, Cosmos has had its fair share of ups and downs, but with recent updates and a growing ecosystem, it’s showing signs of maturity. The Cosmos Hub, which is at the heart of the ecosystem, continues to see strong growth, and the network’s governance features have made it more decentralized and community-driven. In a world where transparency and security are paramount, Cosmos checks all the boxes. Ondo (ONDO) – Privacy Meets DeFi If privacy is your top priority, Ondo is the crypto project to pay attention to. In a world where data breaches and surveillance are on the rise, Ondo offers a refreshing focus on privacy and security. It’s designed to provide privacy features in the decentralized finance (DeFi) space, which has often been criticized for its lack of protection against bad actors. Ondo’s privacy features are built using advanced cryptographic techniques that ensure transactions are not only secure but anonymous. It’s the kind of solution that could make a massive difference for users who are concerned about the security of their financial data. But Ondo isn’t just about privacy—it’s about providing a seamless experience for users who want the benefits of DeFi without compromising on their privacy. While Ondo is still in its early stages, its unique approach to privacy and DeFi has generated interest from those who see the value in a more secure and private financial ecosystem. It’s the kind of project that could help bring more mainstream adoption to decentralized finance by addressing the concerns that many have about security and privacy. For anyone looking for a crypto with long-term potential, Ondo is definitely one to watch. Cross-Border Transactions and Why They Matter Cross-border transactions are more important now than ever before. Whether it’s businesses looking to expand internationally or individuals sending money to family overseas, the need for fast, secure, and low-cost transactions is undeniable. Traditional financial systems have struggled to meet these needs, often taking days to process payments and charging high fees along the way. This is where projects like Qubetics come in, offering a faster and cheaper alternative to traditional systems. With Qubetics, the focus is on making cross-border transactions as easy as possible. Through its use of blockchain technology, Qubetics eliminates many of the pain points associated with international payments. Transactions are faster, more secure, and much more cost-effective than with traditional systems. And with the ongoing presale, it’s clear that Qubetics is gaining traction in the crypto community. As the world becomes more interconnected, the importance of cross-border transactions will only continue to grow, and Qubetics is in a prime position to capitalize on this trend. Conclusion: In 2025, the best crypto to buy this week is one that addresses real-world problems, whether it’s cross-border payments, scalability, or privacy in DeFi. Qubetics, Cosmos, and Ondo are each doing something unique, but Qubetics stands out for its focus on cross-border transactions, which are essential in today’s globalized world. With its impressive presale progress, there’s no telling how high $TICS could go once the mainnet launches. If you’re looking to jump into a promising project that solves real-life problems, Qubetics should be on your radar. Don’t miss out on the opportunity to get in early—$TICS is ready to revolutionize how cross-border transactions are done.

Despite this price gain, the prominent altcoin remains in a downtrend as indicated by its 11.17% loss in the past week. However, prominent analytics platform Glassnode has discovered an important price level that could offer some short-term support. Related Reading: Ethereum Consolidates Since ‘The Big Dump’ – Local Trend Reversal Or Continuation? Investors Boost Accumulation By 300,000 ETH At This Price Region – What Could It Mean? In an X post on March 14, Glassnode provided an intriguing analysis of the ETH market highlighting a potential strong support level. Based on the Cost Basis Distribution (CBD) metric, these analysts believe ETH is likely to hit a major support zone at the $1,886 price level in the case of a further price decline. In the crypto market, CBD represents a crucial on-chain metric that tracks the price levels at which tokens were last sold or bought. When a significant number of coins is acquired within a specific price range, that zone often serves as a support or resistance level. According to Glassnode, Ethereum’s CBD data shows that investors’ supply at $1,886 has grown from 1.6 million ETH to 1.9 million ETH indicating the acquisition of an additional 300,000 ETH when price last reached this level. This development postulates that a significant portion of investors view $1,886 as a crucial price point and are likely to increase their holdings in this region to prevent any further decline thus creating a viable support zone. Glassnode notes that this postulation aligns with insights from its custom capitulation metric design to capture price capitulation events leveraging the use of weighted sell volumes and non-linear economic pain experienced by investors. However, it’s worth noting that the $1,886 price level can only offer short-term support suggesting a likely price capitulation in the presence of overwhelming selling pressure.

Ethereum Price Overview At the time of writing, Ethereum trades at $1,924 following a 5% gain on the last day as previously stated. Meanwhile, the market’s daily trading volume is down by 29.29% and valued at $12.91 billion. Interestingly, the Relative Strength Index metric suggests Ethereum could soon enter the oversold region and potentially experience a price reversal. However, ETH bulls are confronted with multiple resistance zones at $2,249, $2,539, and $2,829 if they are to pull off any significant rebound and halt the current downtrend. On the other hand, any decisive price fall below $1,886 could lead to lower levels Such as $1,650 and $1,132.

Amid this recovery, ADA, the native token of the Cardano blockchain, appears bullish and is poised for a significant rally in the coming days. Cardano (ADA) Technical Analysis and Upcoming Levels According to expert technical analysis, ADA has formed a bullish inverted head and shoulders pattern and is now on the verge of a breakout. Based on recent price momentum, if the asset breaches the pattern’s neckline and closes a four-hour candle above the $0.76 level, there is a strong possibility it could initially soar by 10% to reach $0.85 in the coming days. Source: Trading View However, amid this rally, ADA may face resistance from the 200 Exponential Moving Average (EMA), which currently indicates that the asset is in a downtrend. This bullish thesis will hold only if ADA breaches the $0.76 level, otherwise, the bullish outlook may fail. However, on a longer time frame, ADA appears to be consolidating within a tight range between $0.73 and $0.757 over the past five trading days and is now attempting to break out. If the asset breaches this consolidation and closes a daily candle above the $0.76 level, it could soar significantly by 50% to reach $1.15 in the coming days.
