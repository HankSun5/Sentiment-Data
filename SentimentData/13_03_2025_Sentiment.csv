According to a post shared on X, the company has bought 188 Bitcoin for $17.1 million at an average of $91,000 per Bitcoin. This investment is part of Rumble‚Äôs new treasury strategy, with plans to allocate up to $20 million toward Bitcoin acquisitions. Rumble Strengthens Ties with the Crypto Community The Canada-based gaming and streaming company has built a reputation as a platform that supports decentralized technology. The company‚Äôs decision to add Bitcoin to its balance sheets shows its support for the crypto sector while diversifying its investments beyond traditional markets. Rumble‚Äôs CEO, Chris Pavlovski, explained that Bitcoin can help protect finance against inflation. He pointed out that, unlike regular money governments can print endlessly, Bitcoin has a fixed supply, making it a valuable alternative. The company also mentioned that it may buy more Bitcoin in the future, depending on market conditions, Bitcoin‚Äôs price, and its financial situation. The investment aligns with its broader push into cloud services and alternative media, where blockchain and digital assets are becoming increasingly relevant. Rumble‚Äôs latest Bitcoin comes after Senator Cynthia Lummis reintroduced the national Bitcoin reserves bill days after President Donald Trump signed an executive order to establish a digital asset stockpile. Rumble‚Äôs Stock Increases Amid Financial Implications After the announcement, Rumble‚Äôs stock (RUM) rose 2.7% in Nasdaq‚Äôs pre-market trading. However, some financial experts worry that Rumble bought Bitcoin when the price was too high. Right now, Bitcoin is trading at $82,664, which means Rumble‚Äôs investment is down by 10.33%, losing about $1.77 million in paper value. Despite this short-term, the company seems confident that Bitcoin will grow in value over time. A Growing Presence in Corporate Bitcoin Holdings With this purchase, Rumble is now the 40th largest company holding Bitcoin, according to the Bitcoin Treasuries tracker. Its Bitcoin now makes up 0.60% of its total market value, showing its strong interest in digital money. This move comes after Rumble received a $775 million investment from Tether , the company behind the USDT stablecoin, in December 2024. As Bitcoin and stablecoins become more important to its business, Rumble balances media, cloud technology, and crypto adoption.

This move allows the company to introduce regulated derivative products and services for institutional clients across the European Economic Area (EEA), pending Malta Financial Services Authority (MFSA) approval. The regulation news was made during an exclusive event on Manoel Island, Malta, as part of OKX‚Äôs strategy to strengthen its presence in the European market. OKX Acquires MiFID II License To Expand In Europe According to a recent announcement , OKX secured a MiFID II license through the acquisition of a Malta-based firm that holds the regulatory approval. The entity will become operational later this year after receiving clearance from the Malta Financial Services Authority (MFSA). The MiFID II license will allow OKX to introduce regulated derivatives and investment solutions for institutional clients across the EEA. This move will enhance institutional market access while maintaining compliance with European financial regulations. Previously, OKX received a full Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA) license, enabling the exchange to provide localized crypto trading services across 30 EU member states. The MiCA license supports various offerings, including spot trading, over-the-counter (OTC) trading, and automated trading solutions. Amid these regulation news, earlier this month, top crypto exchange Binance announced that it would be delisting all non-MiCA-compliant stablecoin trading pairs for users in the EEA. Institutional Offerings With Regulatory Compliance OKX‚Äôs expansion under MiFID II aims to align digital assets with traditional financial markets. The company intends to provide institutional-grade services that meet European compliance standards. The newly acquired license will help OKX partner with tier-one financial institutions and introduce new regulated investment products. With the MiFID II approval, OKX plans to integrate additional risk management features and trading solutions tailored for institutional investors. The exchange seeks to offer advanced derivatives products while ensuring security in line with European regulations. Additionally, OKX‚Äôs institutional clients will gain access to new derivatives trading services under the MiFID II license. The platform currently supports trading for over 240 cryptocurrency tokens, 300 trading pairs, and 60 euro-based trading pairs. Concurrently, the top crypto exchange plans to expand its fiat on-ramp options. The company allows users to deposit and withdraw euros at no cost through bank transfers while supporting card payments and other local payment methods. More so, the exchange‚Äôs website and mobile app are designed to support local languages, currency displays, and customer service tailored to each European market. The company is set to introduce more localized services, including streamlined Know Your Customer (KYC) processes. Reacting to the regulation news, Erald Ghoos, OKX Europe CEO added, ‚ÄúWith this license, we are set to deliver institutional-grade services, partner with tier 1 financial institutions, and offer regulated investment solutions that enhance market access and empower investors across the continent.‚Äù The post OKX Expands Institutional Offerings In Europe With MiFID II License appeared first on CoinGape .",24/7 Cryptocurrency News|Regulation News,EN,0,0,TRADING|EXCHANGE|MARKET|REGULATION|BUSINESS,"{'name': 'CoinGape', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coingape.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coingape,2025-03-12 22:34:13

With that move, OKX will be able to offer a wider selection of derivative products to traders from the Euro Area. OKX Europe will gain a MiFID II license for operating in the Euro Area, after acquiring a company already registered with Malta‚Äôs financial authorities. Acquisitions have been the main approach of exchange operators in becoming compliant with EU financial regulations. The Markets in Financial Instruments Directive regulation is one of the key documents setting up the requirements for crypto exchanges.

Learn more: https://t.co/xswBXeyCSF pic.twitter.com/Z7p7tcOuMe ‚Äî OKX (@okx) March 12, 2025 OKX announced the acquisition during an official event in Malta. OKX aims to expand during the current market cycle, by reaching traders of all levels. The exchange has already become the first market operator to become compliant with the Markets in Crypto-Asset (MiCA) Regulation, receiving a pre-authorization status. Currently, OKX is working toward becoming fully MiCA compliant. OKX aims to reach all 28 countries in the European Union, bringing OTC, spot trading, automated, and copy-trading for over 240 tokens in 300 trading pairs. OKX also offers fiat-based pairs against the Euro. The main effect of the MiFID license will be the introduction of advanced derivatives and futures markets. OKX will be able to serve institutional clients with sophisticated trading tools. The exchange is also working toward localization in multiple European languages. The customers of OKX will also be able to deposit and withdraw Euro at no cost through a Euro Area bank transfer. The exchange will offer crypto purchases using cards and other localized payment methods. As a MiFID platform, OKX will offer easier KYC verification, with access to more diverse payment gateways. OKX will continue to announce the new features as they become active. Exchanges target Euro Area for growth OKX is one of the leading exchanges based on trust score. The market operator carried volumes of $3.7B and lined up among the most active centralized markets. Most of the traffic for OKX comes from outside the Euro Area. Visitors from Brazil are the most active, followed by US traders making up 8.2% of site visits. OKX also services crypto-friendly regions and countries, including Vietnam, the Philippines, and Turkey. The recent acquisition aims to expand the services of OKX to a new and highly active crypto market. While smaller, the European market is well-regulated. During the latest bull cycle, investors from Germany, France, and the UK joined some of the latest trends, including memes and prediction markets on Polymarket. EU countries have a lower rank in terms of crypto adoption, lagging behind the USA, as revealed by Chainalysis data . Despite this, OKX aims to tap Europe as a growth market, with increasing crypto adoption. Up to 30.7M European traders have some contact with the crypto market, or non-zero holdings. Major exchanges aim to bring reliable services and a fully regulated market with compliant stablecoin pairings. OKX investigated for the laundering of the Bybit hack funds OKX has been scrutinized for its decentralized services, especially its Web3 wallet. During the Bybit hack, the decentralized service was used to launder a part of the funds, which OKX did not block or freeze. Decentralized services and wallets are still a gray area for regulators, but may be one of the new areas to include under the MiCA compliance requirements. The OKX Web3 wallet is borderless and permissionless, serving as an aggregator and access point to decentralized trading. The ability to scrutinize and freeze transactions remains limited. OKX has only partnered by freezing and blacklisting funds through its centralized exchange. OKX claims its decentralized service is not a part of the exchange‚Äôs main product package. Currently, the service is under investigation in the EU. While OKX Europe is allowed to offer basic services from its Malta headquarters, the investigation of its DEX and Web3 unit may lead to a loss of permission for some operations in the Euro Area.

After reaching a three-day high of $84,437, BTC/USD quickly reversed course as bearish pressure emerged. The U.S. Consumer Price Index (CPI) for January came in below expectations at 2.8%, signaling a slowdown in inflation. Core CPI, which excludes volatile food and energy prices, fell to 3.1%‚Äîalso lower than expected. ‚ÄúThis marks the first decline in both Headline and Core CPI since July 2024. Inflation is cooling down in the US,‚Äù noted The Kobeissi Letter, a trading analysis firm. Despite this seemingly positive data, Wall Street‚Äôs opening saw renewed selling pressure across the cryptocurrency market. Bitcoin fell to $82,400 before stabilizing around its daily opening price. Technical Indicators and Market Trends Popular crypto analyst Rekt Capital pointed out that Bitcoin has started to exit a previously filled CME Gap‚Äîan important price zone linked to Bitcoin futures trading on CME Group. ‚ÄúAny dips into the top of the CME Gap would constitute a post-breakout retest attempt to fully confirm the exit from this CME Gap. Initial signs of that retest occurring already,‚Äù he explained. Other analysts focused on key technical indicators such as the 200-day Simple and Exponential Moving Averages (SMA/EMA), which serve as crucial support levels in bull markets. ‚ÄúBulls got work to do here to get back above the Daily 200MA/EMA. Last year we had the same thing and price chopped around these levels for 3+ months,‚Äù noted trader Daan Crypto Trades. Currently, these levels sit at $83,550 and $85,650, respectively. Bitcoin ETF Outflows Indicate Institutional Caution On the macroeconomic front, trading firm QCP Capital suggested that the CPI data could influence the Federal Reserve‚Äôs upcoming decision on interest rates. ‚ÄúWith inflation concerns lingering and macro risks mounting, the CPI print will be a key determinant of whether the disinflationary trend will hold, or volatility intensifies in the near term,‚Äù QCP stated in its latest market update. Institutional investors are also showing signs of caution. Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) experienced a significant net outflow of $153.87 million, largely driven by Grayscale‚Äôs Bitcoin Trust (GBTC). GBTC offloaded 641 BTC worth $56.45 million, bringing its total holdings down to 195,746 BTC, valued at approximately $17.24 billion. ‚ÄúThis signals growing caution among institutional investors,‚Äù QCP concluded. Looking Ahead: Market Uncertainty Persists With inflation concerns still present and institutional investors adopting a more cautious approach, Bitcoin‚Äôs short-term price action remains uncertain. However, key support levels around $82,000 appear to be holding for now. As traders and investors navigate these developments, all eyes remain on the Federal Reserve‚Äôs upcoming policy decisions and how they might impact broader market sentiment.",Bitcoin|Crypto News Today|Crypto Intelligence,EN,0,0,BTC|TRADING|MARKET|BUSINESS|FIAT,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2025-03-12 22:45:38

While some market participants see President Donald Trump‚Äôs latest executive order as overshadowed by economic uncertainty, K33 analysts insist the initiative is far from insignificant. K33 Head of Research Vetle Lunde and Senior Analyst David Zimmerman noted in a report that the ETH/BTC ratio has also reached its lowest point since December 2020, highlighting Ethereum‚Äôs relative underperformance. Analysts noted that Trump appeared unconcerned about recession risks, instead focusing on lowering U.S. 10-year Treasury yields to help the government refinancing efforts. That, combined with uncertainty about the administration‚Äôs changing stance on tariffs, led to declines in the S&P 500 and Nasdaq, both of which reached their lowest levels since mid-September. Despite these challenges, Bitcoin has gained about 13% since the presidential election, outperforming the Nasdaq and S&P 500, which have both returned negative over the same period. Lunde and Zimmerman attribute this resilience to Trump‚Äôs steadfast stance on crypto, including the creation of a dedicated crypto working group and the announcement of the U.S. Strategic Bitcoin Reserve last week. Related News: Bitcoin Bull Cathie Wood's Company Speaks About BTC For The First Time After The Fall - Still Bullish? ‚ÄúWe fundamentally disagree with experts who attribute the recent sell-off to the inadequacy of the U.S. Bitcoin reserve,‚Äù the analysts wrote, adding: ‚ÄúThis reserve represents a turning point for Bitcoin. It is an important step in legitimizing BTC as a global store of value despite widespread market volatility. While macroeconomic uncertainties persist, we see the current price environment as a strong opportunity for long-term accumulation.‚Äù Trump‚Äôs executive order signed on March 6 officially established the US Strategic Bitcoin Reserve. The reserve will consist of approximately 200,000 BTC ($17 billion) currently under federal surveillance due to asset seizures related to criminal and civil cases. However, some of these funds must be returned to crime victims, leaving an estimated 103,500 BTC in the reserve at its official launch. In particular, the 94,636 BTC seized in the Bitfinex attack is expected to be returned to the exchange rather than kept in the reserve. ‚ÄúThe most influential global superpower has signaled an end to the Bitcoin seizure sales; neither current nor future seizures will be liquidated,‚Äù the analysts wrote, adding: ‚ÄúFurthermore, the administration is actively exploring ways to accumulate more. This could set a precedent for other countries and signal the beginning of a new era for Bitcoin. Given these developments, we believe the current landscape is extremely favorable for long-term Bitcoin accumulation, while short-term uncertainties remain.‚Äù *This is not investment advice.

Imagine a world where developing sophisticated AI agents becomes significantly easier, thanks to a powerful runtime environment designed from the ground up for distributed systems. That vision is now closer to reality with the latest advancements in Dapr. What is Dapr and Why Does it Matter for AI Agents? Back in 2019, tech giant Microsoft open-sourced Dapr (Distributed Application Runtime), a groundbreaking runtime environment aimed at simplifying the development of distributed, microservice-based applications. While AI agents weren‚Äôt the primary buzzword then, Dapr‚Äôs foundational architecture inherently contained key elements perfectly suited for supporting them. At its core, Dapr features ‚Äòvirtual actors‚Äô ‚Äì independent units that can process messages autonomously. This actor model turns out to be exceptionally well-aligned with the needs of modern AI agents . Now, the Dapr team is taking this a step further with the launch of Dapr Agents . This new initiative is specifically designed to provide developers with the essential building blocks for creating and deploying AI agents effectively. Yaron Schneider, co-creator and maintainer of Dapr, highlights the natural synergy: ‚Äú AI Agents are a very good use case for Dapr . From a technical standpoint, actors offer a lightweight and scalable way to run these agents with state management and resource efficiency. While frameworks and workflow engines exist, they often lack the orchestration and statefulness that Dapr inherently provides.‚Äù Key Benefits of Dapr for AI Agents: Scalability and Efficiency: Dapr‚Äôs actor model enables the creation of highly scalable AI agents that can be efficiently managed and run, optimizing resource utilization. State Management: Built-in state management capabilities ensure AI agents can maintain context and data across interactions, crucial for complex tasks and long-running processes. Orchestration: Dapr provides robust orchestration features to coordinate interactions between AI agents and other components of a distributed system, simplifying complex workflows. Simplified Development: By abstracting away the complexities of distributed systems, Dapr allows developers to focus on the core logic of their AI agents , accelerating development cycles. From Floki to Dapr Agents: An Open Source Evolution The genesis of Dapr Agents lies in Floki, a popular open-source project that extended Dapr to specifically cater to AI agent use cases. Recognizing the potential and community interest, the Dapr and Floki teams, including Microsoft AI researcher Roberto Rodriguez, joined forces to bring Floki under the official Dapr umbrella. This collaboration ensures the continued development and support of this powerful new framework for AI agents . Mark Fussell, another co-creator and maintainer of Dapr, aptly describes the shift in perspective: ‚ÄúIn many ways, we see agentic systems and the terminology around them as another term for ‚Äò distributed systems .‚Äô Rather than calling them microservices, you can now call them agents, especially with the integration of large language models.‚Äù The core principle remains the same: efficient coordination and statefulness are paramount, whether you‚Äôre building microservices or sophisticated AI agents . This is precisely where Dapr excels. How Dapr Empowers Distributed AI Systems Dapr ‚Äòs architecture is ideally suited for the demands of distributed systems , particularly those involving AI agents . Its actor model is designed for extreme efficiency, enabling agents to spin up in milliseconds when a message arrives and gracefully shut down once their task is complete, all while preserving their state. This ephemeral and stateful nature is critical for building responsive and resource-conscious AI applications. Connectivity and Tooling: Broad Model Support: Dapr Agents offer out-of-the-box compatibility with leading model providers, including AWS Bedrock, OpenAI, Anthropic, Mistral, and Hugging Face. Support for local LLMs is also on the horizon. Tool Integration: Extending the existing Dapr framework, Dapr Agents allow developers to define a suite of tools that agents can leverage to accomplish specific tasks. This modularity and extensibility are key to building versatile AI agents . Language Support: Currently, Dapr Agents supports Python, with .NET support launching imminently. Java, JavaScript, and Go support are planned to follow, ensuring broad accessibility for developers across different ecosystems. Unlocking the Potential of Open Source AI with Dapr The introduction of Dapr Agents marks a significant step forward in making open source AI development more accessible and manageable. By providing a robust and scalable runtime environment, Dapr empowers developers to build complex, distributed AI agent applications with greater ease and efficiency. As the AI landscape continues to evolve, tools like Dapr will be instrumental in democratizing access to advanced AI technologies and fostering innovation within the open source AI community. Key Takeaways: Feature Benefit for AI Agents Virtual Actors Scalable and efficient agent execution State Management Persistent agent context and data Orchestration Engine Simplified coordination of complex AI workflows Broad Model Support Integration with leading AI model providers Tool Integration Extensible agent capabilities Embrace the Future of AI with Dapr Dapr ‚Äòs embrace of AI agents signifies a pivotal moment in the evolution of both microservices and artificial intelligence. By leveraging the power of Dapr ‚Äòs runtime, developers can now confidently build and deploy sophisticated AI agent applications that are scalable, resilient, and easier to manage than ever before. This move not only simplifies the development process but also opens up exciting new possibilities for the future of AI in distributed environments.

Kevin points to several convergent technical indicators, including a back test of the macro 0.5 Fibonacci retracement near $0.158, a retest of descending multi‚Äêyear trend lines, a convergence with both the 200‚Äêweek Simple Moving Average (SMA) and Exponential Moving Average (EMA), and an historically low 3‚ÄêDay RSI reading. Buy Dogecoin Now? The DOGE/USD weekly chart reveals several Fibonacci retracement lines that may serve as support or potential downside targets. Around $0.158, Dogecoin is testing the 0.5 Fib level, while deeper areas include 0.618 near $0.1157, 0.65 near $0.1092, 0.70 around $0.097, 0.786 near $0.080, and a more distant 1.0 Fib labeled around $0.0942. Historically, these Fib zones have been areas where price action may stabilize if a downtrend continues. Kevin also highlights resistance near $0.28 (the 0.236 Fib) and an upper boundary around $0.47‚Äì$0.48 that marks a major swing high from previous rallies. From a trend perspective, the price is hovering in the $0.16‚Äì$0.17 region, where it is retesting the broken descending trend line drawn from Dogecoin‚Äôs 2021 peaks. Kevin‚Äôs analysis suggests that if Dogecoin can hold this line as support, it would reinforce the bullish scenario. Related Reading: Dogecoin‚Äôs Darkest Hour? Sentiment Tanks, Whales Accumulate In tandem, the 200‚Äêweek SMA and EMA‚Äîoften regarded as markers of long‚Äêterm market health‚Äîare situated in the approximate $0.13‚Äì$0.17 corridor. The overlap between these critical moving averages and the Fib levels underscores what Kevin sees as a strong risk‚Äêto‚Äêreward setup for long‚Äêterm positioning. He also points out that the 3‚ÄêDay RSI has reached territory he considers ‚Äúhistorically low,‚Äù hinting at a possible oversold condition. Beyond technical considerations, Kevin expresses a broader macroeconomic viewpoint: ‚ÄúIf BTC holds up and Macro Economic Data and Monetary policy adjust then you just got your last opportunity to buy Dogecoin relatively cheap. A lot of factors at play and lots of work to do But the risk reward at this level is superb given the circumstances.‚Äù He suggests that despite strong employment numbers and moderating inflation (supported by Truflation data and falling energy costs), the market is ‚Äúwiping out trillions of dollars of wealth everyday on pure speculation of what imaginary Tariffs are gonna do that they knew were coming.‚Äù Related Reading: Dogecoin Crash? Analyst Predicts Drop To $0.12 Before Rebound He adds: ‚ÄúEmployment numbers are phenomenal, growth is still strong, inflation is coming down rapidly per Truflation data and energy costs falling are the reason, the Fed is about to start easing again, wars are getting ready to end soon.‚Äù He argues that the Federal Reserve may soon pivot to more accommodative policies and that ongoing geopolitical tensions may be waning.

Simultaneously, analysts are highlighting an AI token that appears poised to deliver astronomical returns of 5,437% before June 2025: FloppyPepe (FPPE). Ethereum Price Surge: A Prelude To Bullish Trends The current market indicators suggest that the Ethereum price is poised for a dramatic surge. Analysts report that the huge amounts of Ethereum (ETH) purchased in the last 72 hours, along with the fallout from the Bybit hack, could boost the price. With each progressive update and strategic network upgrade, Ethereum (ETH) is drawing closer to its next significant milestone. Additional market research reveals that a stabilized Ethereum price is likely to attract even more participation from both seasoned and emerging market players. A comprehensive analysis of recent trends indicates that an upward shift in the Ethereum price signifies market recovery and serves as an indicator of broader altcoin momentum. FloppyPepe (FPPE): From Iconic Art To AI Token King FloppyPepe (FPPE) has rapidly positioned itself as a premier AI token, garnering attention from both market aficionados and crypto newbies alike. Conceived by the genius mind of Matt Furie, the creator of Pepe the Frog, whose cultural imprint spans far beyond his original canvas, FloppyPepe (FPPE) not only cements his legacy as a visionary in the crypto space but also redefines the capabilities of an AI token in the digital asset arena. The token‚Äôs robust security is reinforced by its smart contract, which blockchain security expert SolidProof rigorously audited. This diligence has fortified FloppyPepe‚Äôs (FPPE) position as one of the most reliable AI tokens available today. Further bolstering its appeal, FloppyPepe (FPPE) is collaborating with a top-leading artist to produce regular, hand-drawn pieces of FloppyPepe (FPPE) art, a creative endeavor. This creative endeavor, visual identity, and cultural cachet. At the core of FloppyPepe‚Äôs (FPPE) design is a deflationary tokenomics model. Each transaction involving this AI token burns 1% of tokens to increase scarcity while redistributing 3% to the community. This mechanism rewards long-term holders and contributes to a gradual reduction in the circulating supply, which could drive up the token‚Äôs value over time. Complementing this, the ecosystem introduces FloppyX , a cutting-edge AI agent that generates videos through text interactions, delivering consistent characters and incorporating real-time polls, feedback, and sentiment analysis. Alongside FloppyX is Meme-o-Matic , an AI agent designed to generate witty memes from submitted texts, video clips, and images, further amplifying community engagement. The newly integrated FloppyAI within this AI token also handles diverse inputs ranging from user queries to real-time market data. By applying advanced techniques such as natural language processing, pattern recognition, and predictive modeling, the system generates outputs in textual and visual formats while executing automated operational actions within the FloppyPepe (FPPE) ecosystem. This continuous feedback loop refines the AI token‚Äôs responses and adapts to shifting market dynamics. Recent developments include an AI video agent that produces high-quality videos and an AI text-to-image agent that was recently introduced to the Telegram community. Both are designed to expand the token‚Äôs utility and broaden its appeal. Notably, the ongoing presale for this AI token is attractively priced at $0.0000002 . The private round sold out within 24 hours and raised $907,200 . Act Now: Join The Presale For A Historic Crypto Leap With the rise of the Ethereum price, the ascent of a formidable AI token creates a market scenario that is truly beneficial for crypto enthusiasts who want to cash in and become wealthy. As the rising Ethereum price continues to fuel market optimism, and the unique features behind FloppyPepe (FPPE) are setting the stage for a paradigm shift in the digital asset realm. Early momentum is unmistakable. The private round of this AI token sold out within 24 hours to raise $907,200, a clear signal of the market‚Äôs confidence in its ability to transform lives and create unimaginable wealth.

This urgent development, first reported by Cointelegraph, signals a significant escalation in the global crackdown on illicit activities within the digital asset space. But who exactly is Aleksej Be≈°ciokov, and what does this Garantex founder arrest mean for the future of crypto exchanges? Who is Aleksej Be≈°ciokov and What is Garantex? Before diving into the specifics of the arrest, it‚Äôs crucial to understand who Aleksej Be≈°ciokov is and the nature of Garantex. Garantex is a cryptocurrency exchange that has come under intense scrutiny, particularly from the United States, due to concerns about its role in facilitating illicit financial flows. Here‚Äôs a quick rundown: Aleksej Be≈°ciokov: The founder of Garantex, now in the custody of Indian authorities. He is facing serious charges in the U.S., painting a picture of a key figure in the controversial world of crypto exchanges. Garantex: A Russian cryptocurrency exchange sanctioned by the U.S. Department of the Treasury‚Äôs Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC). The exchange has been flagged for allegedly enabling money laundering and facilitating transactions for illicit actors. The U.S. authorities have been keeping a close watch on Garantex, and Be≈°ciokov‚Äôs arrest underscores the international reach of law enforcement in targeting individuals associated with exchanges deemed to be operating outside the bounds of regulatory compliance. Unpacking the Money Laundering Charges: Why Was Be≈°ciokov Arrested? The arrest isn‚Äôt just about regulatory breaches; it‚Äôs about serious criminal allegations. Aleksej Be≈°ciokov is facing significant charges in the United States, including: Conspiracy to Launder Money: This is a grave charge indicating that Be≈°ciokov is accused of being involved in schemes to conceal the origins of illegally obtained funds, using Garantex as a conduit. Conspiracy to Operate an Unlicensed Money Transmitter: This charge suggests that Garantex allegedly functioned as a money transmitting business without the necessary licenses and in violation of U.S. laws. These money laundering charges highlight the severity of the situation. The U.S. sees these actions as a threat to financial integrity and national security. The accusations paint a picture of Garantex as more than just a platform for trading crypto; it‚Äôs portrayed as a potential tool for criminal activities. The extradition request from the U.S. further emphasizes the seriousness with which American authorities are treating this case. India‚Äôs Role and the Extradition Process: What Happens Next? India‚Äôs involvement in this arrest is pivotal. Be≈°ciokov was apprehended by the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI), India‚Äôs premier investigative agency. This signifies international cooperation in tackling crypto-related crime. But what does this mean for Be≈°ciokov and the extradition process? Arrest in India: Be≈°ciokov‚Äôs arrest in India demonstrates the global reach of international law enforcement and the willingness of nations to collaborate on such cases. Extradition to the U.S.: He is expected to be extradited to the United States in accordance with India‚Äôs Extradition Act. This legal process could involve hearings and appeals, but the initial signs point towards cooperation between India and the U.S. Legal Framework: India‚Äôs Extradition Act provides the legal basis for sending individuals accused of crimes in other countries back to face justice. This case will test and highlight the effectiveness of this framework in the context of cryptocurrency-related offenses. The India extradition process is now set to begin, and it will be closely watched by the crypto community and legal experts alike. It underscores the increasing legal ramifications for individuals operating in the crypto space, regardless of their geographical location. Is This Part of a Broader Crypto Exchange Crackdown? Be≈°ciokov‚Äôs arrest isn‚Äôt an isolated incident. It‚Äôs happening amidst a global push for stricter regulation and enforcement within the cryptocurrency sector. Governments worldwide are becoming increasingly concerned about the potential for crypto exchanges to be used for illicit activities. Is this the start of a larger crypto exchange crackdown ? Global Regulatory Scrutiny: Regulators across the globe are tightening their grip on crypto exchanges. Concerns about money laundering, terrorist financing, and sanctions evasion are driving this increased scrutiny. Increased Enforcement Actions: We‚Äôre seeing a rise in enforcement actions against crypto platforms that are perceived to be non-compliant or facilitating illegal activities. Garantex is just one example, but many other exchanges are under the microscope. International Cooperation: The Be≈°ciokov arrest highlights the growing collaboration between international law enforcement agencies. Countries are working together to share information and coordinate actions against crypto crime. This trend suggests that the era of loosely regulated crypto exchanges might be coming to an end. Exchanges operating internationally need to be more vigilant about compliance and anti-money laundering (AML) measures. The arrest sends a clear message: there are real-world consequences for failing to adhere to global financial regulations. What Does This Arrest Mean for the Crypto Industry? The arrest of Aleksej Be≈°ciokov is more than just about one individual or one exchange. It has broader implications for the entire cryptocurrency industry. What lessons can be learned, and what impact will this have on the future of crypto? Heightened Compliance Demands: Crypto exchanges worldwide will likely face even greater pressure to enhance their compliance frameworks. This includes robust KYC (Know Your Customer) and AML procedures. Increased User Scrutiny: Users of crypto exchanges may become more cautious and discerning, opting for platforms with a proven track record of regulatory compliance and transparency. Potential for Market Consolidation: Stricter regulations and enforcement actions could lead to market consolidation, with smaller, less compliant exchanges struggling to survive, while larger, more regulated platforms gain dominance. Focus on Decentralization vs. Regulation: This situation reignites the ongoing debate about decentralization in crypto versus the need for regulation. Finding the right balance remains a critical challenge for the industry. The case of Aleksej Be≈°ciokov and Garantex serves as a stark reminder that the crypto industry is not immune to traditional financial regulations and law enforcement. It underscores the necessity for crypto businesses to operate within legal frameworks and prioritize compliance to avoid severe repercussions. Conclusion: A Watershed Moment for Crypto Regulation The arrest of Garantex founder Aleksej Be≈°ciokov in India marks a significant moment in the ongoing evolution of cryptocurrency regulation. It demonstrates the increasing global cooperation in tackling crypto-related crime and sends a clear message to exchanges operating in the grey areas of compliance. As the extradition process unfolds and more details emerge, the crypto industry will be closely watching, understanding that this case could set precedents for future enforcement actions. The era of unchecked crypto operations is swiftly closing, paving the way for a more regulated and, hopefully, more secure digital asset ecosystem.

Changing enforcement approaches are emerging within the US crypto sector. Ripple‚Äôs legal strategy reflects a broader industry adjustment in oversight. The resolution may shape how future digital asset disputes are handled. The United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has moved closer to ending its prolonged legal battle against Ripple, according to Fox Business reporter Eleanor Terrett in a March 12 X post. Ripple, SEC Allegedly Nearing Agreement According to Terrett‚Äôs post on Wednesday, two sources familiar with the matter claim the SEC is considering ending its legal dispute with Ripple once final terms are agreed upon. SCOOP: Two well-placed sources tell me that the @SECGov vs. @Ripple case is in the process of wrapping up and could be over soon. My understanding is that the delay in reaching an agreement is due to Ripple's legal team negotiating more favorable terms regarding the August‚Ä¶ ‚Äî Eleanor Terrett (@EleanorTerrett) March 12, 2025 Negotiations have reportedly stalled due to Ripple‚Äôs legal team seeking a more favorable outcome concerning a July 2023 ruling by District Court Judge Analisa Torres , which required the company to pay a $125 million fine. The ruling was viewed as a partial win for Ripple, as the imposed fine was substantially lower than the nearly $2 billion originally sought by the SEC. In October 2024, the SEC appealed Torres‚Äô ruling, a move Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse criticized for damaging the regulator‚Äôs credibility and reputation. If Gensler and the SEC were rational, they would have moved on from this case long ago. It certainly hasn‚Äôt protected investors and instead has damaged the credibility and reputation of the SEC.

Crypto Sector Sees Regulatory Changes In The U.S. News of the potential deal comes amid broader regulatory shifts in the SEC‚Äôs approach to the blockchain industry following the resignation of former chair Gary Gensler. During Gensler‚Äôs tenure, the agency pursued multiple lawsuits against major crypto firms, including Kraken, Coinbase, and Consensys. Recently, the SEC has dropped several digital asset-related lawsuits, though cases against major firms like Coinbase and Robinhood remain ongoing. Former U.S. President Donald Trump has voiced support for cryptocurrency regulations but has received mixed reactions from the crypto community regarding his stance. If the SEC settles with Ripple, the company would be among a growing list of crypto firms no longer facing regulatory penalties. Ripple‚Äôs Fate and the Bigger Picture A resolution to the SEC‚Äôs case against Ripple would be a victory for the company, but the broader fight over crypto regulation remains far from settled. While some firms have seen enforcement actions dropped, others continue to face legal challenges, highlighting the fragmented approach that has left the industry in limbo. A shift away from aggressive lawsuits may signal a more measured strategy, but without a defined regulatory framework, digital asset firms remain in a state of uncertainty. The question now is whether policymakers will seize the moment to provide clarity or leave the industry guessing once again. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) How might a resolution in the SEC-Ripple case influence US crypto regulations? Resolving this legal dispute may prompt regulators to recalibrate their enforcement strategies, fostering a clearer framework for digital asset operations. Such a shift might influence oversight in similar future cases. What could this settlement mean for Ripple‚Äôs market outlook? A resolution might boost investor confidence and refine market perceptions about Ripple‚Äôs operational stance. This could also encourage a steadier regulatory environment for other digital asset ventures. How does this development affect future crypto legal challenges? This outcome may set a precedent, prompting clearer legal interpretations in crypto disputes. A defined resolution could reshape judicial reviews and strategies for regulators and digital asset firms in future challenges.

41560527,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=139600,1741821041,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Altcoin ETF Approval Halted: Uncertainty Grips Crypto Market as SEC Chairman Wait Continues,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/altcoin-etf-approval-halted/,"Excitement around Altcoin ETFs has hit a snag, leaving investors in suspense. The much-anticipated approval of exchange-traded funds (ETFs) for cryptocurrencies beyond Bitcoin and Ethereum is now facing significant delays. Why? The crypto community is pointing towards the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and the ongoing wait for a new chairman. Let‚Äôs dive into what this means for the future of Altcoin ETF and the broader crypto market. Why is the SEC Chairman Appointment Crucial for ETF Approval? The leadership at the SEC plays a pivotal role in shaping regulatory decisions, especially concerning innovative financial products like cryptocurrency ETFs. Currently, the SEC is awaiting the confirmation of a new chairman nominated by former U.S. President Donald Trump, Paul Atkins. Until this appointment is finalized and the new chairman takes office, major policy decisions, including the green light for ETF Approval for altcoins, are likely to remain in limbo. Here‚Äôs why the chairman‚Äôs role is so critical: Policy Direction: The chairman sets the overall agenda and regulatory tone for the SEC. A chairman with a more favorable or understanding stance towards crypto could expedite the review and approval process for crypto-related investment products. Decision-Making Authority: While decisions are often made collectively by the commissioners, the chairman‚Äôs influence is substantial. They can steer discussions, prioritize agendas, and influence the direction of investigations and approvals. Regulatory Clarity: A new chairman can bring fresh perspectives and potentially push for clearer regulatory frameworks for digital assets. This clarity is essential for the SEC to confidently approve complex financial instruments like Cryptocurrency ETF s. Altcoin ETF Approval: What‚Äôs the Current Status? Recent developments indicate a continued cautious approach from the SEC towards expanding crypto investment options. According to a CoinDesk report, the SEC has recently extended the review deadlines for several spot Altcoin ETF applications. These include ETFs focused on popular cryptocurrencies like: XRP (XRP ETF) Solana (SOL ETF) Dogecoin (DOGE ETF) Litecoin (LTC ETF) This extension of deadlines suggests that the SEC is not yet ready to give the nod to these products. The reasons for delay are multifaceted and likely include ongoing concerns about market manipulation, investor protection, and the overall maturity of the altcoin market. Paul Atkins: Potential New SEC Chairman ‚Äì What Does It Mean for Crypto? The nomination of Paul Atkins as the potential new SEC Chairman has sparked discussions within the crypto community. Atkins, a former SEC commissioner himself, is known for his pro-market stance and has previously expressed concerns about over-regulation. His potential appointment could signal a shift in the SEC‚Äôs approach to digital assets. However, it‚Äôs important to note: Nomination vs. Confirmation: While nominated by former President Trump, Atkins still needs to undergo a confirmation hearing. The date for this hearing remains unset, introducing further uncertainty. Potential Policy Shift: If confirmed, Atkins could bring a more industry-friendly perspective to the SEC. This might lead to a more streamlined process for reviewing and potentially approving Cryptocurrency ETF s, including those for altcoins. No Guarantees: Even with a potentially favorable chairman, the approval of Altcoin ETF s is not guaranteed. The SEC will still need to address its concerns regarding market risks and ensure investor protection. The Ripple Effect: Impact of Delayed ETF Approval on the Crypto Market The delay in ETF Approval for altcoins has several implications for the cryptocurrency market: Investor Sentiment: The prolonged wait can dampen investor enthusiasm, especially among institutional investors who are keen to access crypto markets through regulated and familiar investment vehicles like ETFs. Market Access: ETFs provide broader market access, particularly for retail investors who may find it challenging to directly hold and manage cryptocurrencies. Delays restrict this access and potentially slow down mainstream adoption. Price Volatility: Uncertainty surrounding regulatory approvals can contribute to price volatility in the altcoin market. Positive news about potential ETF approvals often leads to price surges, while delays can trigger dips. Competitive Landscape: Other regions, like Europe and Canada, have already approved Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs. The US lagging behind in Cryptocurrency ETF approvals could impact its competitive position in the global crypto landscape. Navigating the Uncertainty: What Can Crypto Investors Do? In the face of this regulatory uncertainty, what steps can crypto investors take? Stay Informed: Keep abreast of regulatory developments, SEC announcements, and news regarding the chairman appointment. Reliable sources like CoinDesk and other reputable crypto news outlets are crucial. Diversify Investments: Diversification remains a key strategy in volatile markets. Don‚Äôt put all your eggs in one basket, especially when it comes to speculative assets like altcoins. Long-Term Perspective: Regulatory processes can be lengthy. Maintain a long-term investment perspective and avoid making impulsive decisions based on short-term news cycles. Engage with the Community: Participate in discussions and forums to understand the broader market sentiment and share insights with fellow investors. Conclusion: The Waiting Game for Altcoin ETFs Continues The path to Altcoin ETF approval in the US remains uncertain, largely dependent on the appointment and approach of the new SEC chairman. While the nomination of Paul Atkins offers a glimmer of hope for a potentially more crypto-friendly regulatory environment, the confirmation process and subsequent policy shifts are not guaranteed. For now, the crypto market must continue to navigate this period of regulatory ambiguity, with investors closely watching for any signals that might indicate a change in direction from the SEC. The dream of easily accessible and regulated Cryptocurrency ETF s for a wider range of digital assets is still alive, but patience remains the name of the game.

Despite a surprise softening of US consumer price inflation that gives the Fed room to ease rates later in 2025, per data released on Wednesday, has failed to substantially lift the Ethereum price, which continues to languish well below $2,000. That‚Äôs despite a solid recovery from lows of other major cryptos like Bitcoin , XRP and BNB . Indeed, the ETH/BTC ration just hit its lowest level in nearly 5 years under 0.023. Ethereum‚Äôs accelerating downwards spiral versus Bitcoin is of major concern to its investors. At this rate, a retest of its 2019 lows around 0.016 could come imminently. And with the Ethereum price chart sending strong bearish signals, more downside is very likely. Here‚Äôs Where the Ethereum Price is Headed Next The Ethereum price has seen a break below, then rejection of the key long-term $2,140 resistance level in recent days. That sends a strong bearish signal that the 2024- early 2024 $2,000-$4,000 range is a thing of the past, and that Ethereum is likely to find a new range at lower levels. Bears will be eyeing a retest of the next major support zone around $1,500. A retest of these levels seems very likely in the context of an uncertain macro backdrop. Yes, softening US inflation gives the Fed more room to signal a slightly more dovish stance in 2025. But the markets main concern will remain growing US recession risk as D.O.G.E austerity and Trump trade war uncertainty start to take their toll economic growth. Mohamed El-Erian, a Bloomberg Opinion columnist, says the chance of a US recession is now at 25%-30%. El-Erian had the probability of a recession at 10% at the beginning of the year https://t.co/uM8FjGPhCZ pic.twitter.com/aT7P39i72f ‚Äî Bloomberg TV (@BloombergTV) March 12, 2025 If recession signals keep piling up in the coming weeks, and the market isn‚Äôt sufficiently satisfied that the Fed will be there to ‚Äúsave the day‚Äù, risk appetite is likely to continue to deteriorate. And while Bitcoin could hold up well thanks to strengthening narratives around it as a safe-haven, store of wealth asset, which have been emboldened since the Trump administration announced the creation of a strategic Bitcoin reserve , Ethereum is unlikely to receive much of a bid. Fundamentals thus suggest a retest of $1,500 is looking very likely. Buy the Ethereum Dip? So if the Ethereum price is destined to collapse to lower levels, would this be a good time for investors to buy the dip. Yes, for investors willing to hold through significant near-term turbulence, buying any ETH dip would likely be a good move. Macro uncertainties will not last forever. And, at some point, US financial conditions are likely to to substantially ease, meaning a surge of liquidity in the market. Prior periods of strong Ethereum price performance have come at times of increased/increasing liquidity from the Fed. So a strong rebound is to be expected as the Fed juices the market. Meanwhile, over the longer term, tailwinds from the Trump administration‚Äôs pro-crypto policy stance should also aid Ethereum. Eric Trump likes Ethereum. pic.twitter.com/Bl0s1zeygF ‚Äî Altcoin Daily (@AltcoinDailyio) February 3, 2025 The Trump administration is full of ETH HODLers. And regulatory clarity will give the Ethereum ecosystem a lot of room to grow over the coming years. Traders must also remember that Ethereum remains the dominant DeFi chain, and the most trusted smart contract blockchain in crypto, hence its backing from BlackRock. As ugly as things look right now, and as much FUD as there is in the market, Ethereum‚Äôs long-term outlook remains strong. Its biggest problem into the future is likely to remain a deteriorating market share as nimbler rivals attract new users at a faster rather than Ethereum does. That said, Ethereum is still far and away the best candidate for major institutions looking to take part in DeFi, thanks to its status as the most trusted and decentralized of the smart contract blockchains. Accumulating ETH as it approaches $1,500 with a view to hold for at least a few years could be a great strategy. Investors should not rule out the possibility that ETH reaches $10,000 by the end of Trump‚Äôs four year term.

The law regulates cryptocurrency automatic teller machines (ATMs). It establishes conditions for operating crypto ATMs and provides consumer protections for ATM users. The bill passed the state‚Äôs 49-member nonpartisan, unicameral legislature on March 6 with 48 votes in favor and one legislator excused from voting. Governor Jim Pillen signed the bill on March 11. The act makes ATM operators liable for some fraud Under the new law , crypto ATM operators must have a money transmitter license. They are required to make their fees known in advance and post clear warnings about potential scams and other risks associated with cryptocurrency. New customers will be limited to $2,000 a day in transactions, and established customers will be allowed $10,500 a day. Operators will also have to have a refund policy for customers who report fraud within 30 days. New customers are eligible for a full refund on funds lost to fraud while existing customers would get fees returned. Operators will be required to have a full-time compliance officer and an anti-fraud policy backed up by the use of blockchain analytics software. They will provide live customer service on weekdays from 7:00 a.m. to 9:00 p.m. and a ‚Äúdedicated communication method‚Äù with law enforcement. The governor spun the new law as support for the crypto industry. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôve been working hard to build Nebraska into a cryptocurrency leader. An important part of these efforts is to make sure that we have guardrails to prevent criminals from taking advantage of Nebraskans,‚Äù Pillen said in a statement announcing the bill‚Äôs signing. According to the American Association of Retired Persons (AARP), Nebraskans reported 239 scams with cryptocurrency in 2023. They lost a cumulative $14.6 million in those scams. Real losses were probably much higher but unreported, the AARP added. Nebraska has passed several acts affecting crypto The bill was introduced by Eliot Bostar in January. The law will go into effect three months after the legislature adjourns for Spring. According to Bitcoinlaws.io, there is no other Bitcoin-related legislation¬†currently being considered in the state. There is, however, a bill introduced at the request of the governor that would¬†impose¬†a 2.5-cent per kWh excise tax on cryptocurrency mining operations consuming over 1,000 kWh annually and allow public power districts to require financial assurances from these operations, among other things. That bill is currently in hearings. Bostar introduced the Adopt the Blockchain Basics Act, which would have regulated cryptocurrency mining, custody, and trading, in 2023. That bill was carried over into 2024, but its¬†status¬†since April has been ‚Äúindefinitely postponed.‚Äù Nebraska hosts Telcoin Bank, an issuer of the eUSD stablecoin. Telcoin was chartered as the state‚Äôs first Digital Asset Depository Institution in February, after applying in December. Telcoin founder and CEO Paul Neuner said, ‚ÄúThe Nebraska charter creates an actual bank charter and the first that is explicitly authorized to connect consumers to DeFi [decentralized finance].‚Äù The concept of Digital Asset Depository Institution was introduced in the Nebraska Financial Innovation Act of 2021. That law established a regulatory framework for digital asset depositories and allowed existing state-chartered banks to operate digital asset divisions. It also brought state legislation in line with the Uniform Commercial Code. Nebraska was also one of the 18 states that sued the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and its then-chair Gary Gensler in November, alleging the agency and its head had shown ‚Äúgross government overreach.‚Äù Cryptopolitan Academy: Tired of market swings?

Among the notable players are Qubetics, Bittensor TAO, and Bitcoin Cash, all of which have demonstrated significant potential for exponential returns. With the market‚Äôs volatility and fluctuating sentiment, these cryptocurrencies stand out for their resilience, innovation, and underlying technologies. For those looking for high-reward opportunities, these cryptos have captured the attention of the broader community. Bitcoin Cash (BCH) is proving its strength, managing to hold steady above critical support levels while offering participants a glimpse of growth potential. Meanwhile, Bittensor TAO is showing promising signs of recovery, poised to break key resistance levels with the backing of Bitcoin‚Äôs recent rally. As market conditions shift in favor of bullish movements, these two projects offer a solid foundation for those seeking best cryptos for exponential returns. Now, a new contender has entered the stage: Qubetics. Unlike its predecessors, Qubetics is focused on solving real-world problems that have plagued the blockchain and digital finance sectors. With its Real World Asset Tokenisation Marketplace, Qubetics aims to provide businesses, professionals, and individuals with the tools they need to navigate the ever-evolving world of digital assets. Qubetics: A New Era in Blockchain and Digital Finance Qubetics is making waves with its innovative approach to tokenizing real-world assets. The Real World Asset Tokenisation Marketplace aims to bridge the gap between traditional assets and the digital world. By allowing businesses and individuals to tokenize physical and digital assets, Qubetics will facilitate faster, more secure, and more transparent transactions. This platform is set to revolutionize how assets are traded and exchanged. For professionals and businesses, the ability to tokenize real-world assets provides opportunities to unlock liquidity, reduce barriers to entry, and create a more dynamic market for assets that were previously illiquid. Participants in the Qubetics presale have already witnessed significant momentum, with the $TICS token currently priced at $0.1074. As the presale progresses, experts predict substantial returns, with potential for 830% to 9,206% ROI after the mainnet launch, making Qubetics a prime candidate for those seeking best cryptos for exponential returns. The crypto presale is currently in its 25th stage, having sold over 499 million tokens to more than 22,900 holders. As the project continues to build momentum, early adopters are positioning themselves for significant gains. With a projected $TICS price increase to $1 after the presale, and potential for $5 to $15 following the mainnet launch, the community is buzzing with excitement over Qubetics‚Äô potential to solve long-standing issues in the blockchain space as one of the best cryptos for exponential returns. Bittensor TAO: A Rising Star in Blockchain Bittensor (TAO) is making a comeback after a rough period, and its prospects are looking bright. Following a 30% decline, TAO has rebounded by 13.93% in the last 24 hours, signaling strong upward momentum. Analysts are closely watching as TAO is testing a falling wedge breakout, a historically bullish pattern that could propel the price toward a $400 target. The recent market recovery, led by Bitcoin, has provided TAO with the support it needs to push toward new highs. TAO‚Äôs technical analysis suggests that if it can clear key resistance levels, it could potentially reach its target price of $400, offering participants a solid opportunity for exponential returns. The market‚Äôs current bullish sentiment is favoring altcoins like TAO, making it an ideal time for those looking to capitalize on the recovery. TAO‚Äôs blockchain network is particularly attractive due to its focus on artificial intelligence (AI), offering decentralized machine learning models. This innovative technology is drawing attention from the crypto community, with expectations that it will drive future growth and adoption. For those seeking exposure to the AI sector through blockchain, TAO provides an enticing entry point. Bitcoin Cash (BCH): Resilience Amidst Volatility Bitcoin Cash (BCH) has demonstrated resilience during periods of market turbulence, managing to stabilize above the $345 support level after a 5% drop. Despite the broader market downturn, BCH has shown more strength compared to Bitcoin, which posted losses of over 8%. BCH‚Äôs ability to hold key support levels is a positive sign for backers looking for stability in a volatile market. However, the derivatives markets reveal some downside risks. BCH could face significant sell-offs if the price falls below the $339 level, as many bear traders have already placed short positions, potentially triggering liquidations. Yet, BCH has shown that it can recover from such pullbacks, making it an attractive option for those looking for a more stable crypto asset that has the potential for exponential returns if it regains upward momentum. With increasing network activity and the potential for positive catalysts in the market, Bitcoin Cash remains a strong contender for those interested in capturing long-term gains. While the risk of downside exists, BCH‚Äôs robust infrastructure and backing by a loyal community position it as a resilient cryptocurrency in times of market uncertainty. Final Thoughts As the crypto market continues to evolve, community members and participants are presented with unique opportunities to generate exponential returns. Qubetics, Bittensor TAO, and Bitcoin Cash are all showing significant potential for growth, each offering a unique value proposition. Whether it‚Äôs Qubetics‚Äô innovative approach to tokenizing real-world assets, TAO‚Äôs cutting-edge AI-driven blockchain, or BCH‚Äôs resilience in the face of volatility, these cryptos are primed for exponential growth. Qubetics, in particular, is set to be a game-changer in the blockchain and digital finance sectors. Its Real World Asset Tokenisation Marketplace addresses the pressing need for liquidity and accessibility in the asset market, making it an exciting project for future gains. As the presale continues to gather momentum, those seeking best cryptos for exponential returns should keep an eye on Qubetics and its groundbreaking solutions.

On the technicals, Solana is inching toward a death cross for the third time in its history. Alameda Unstakes 177,000 SOL Amid Distribution Spree According to an Arkham post , an Alameda Research-associated address has unstaked $23 million SOL, distributing the funds to several addresses. On-chain data indicates that the Alameda staking address received $22.9 million SOL following a staking address unlock. Upon receipt of the tokens, the funds were distributed to 37 addresses associated with FTX and Alameda. Cumulatively, the 37 recipient addresses hold $178.82 million SOL, sparking fears of a selloff. Typically, unstaking large amounts of SOL triggers selling pressure for Solana price. In the event of a sale, excess SOL floods the market and if demands fall to match supply, prices take a massive hit. A move to exchanges will confirm speculation of a selloff with similar moves historically triggering corrections for Solana price. At the start of March, Solana whales unstaked nearly $1 billion SOL as prices tumbled to multiple-month lows. Solana Price Marches Toward Death Cross Onchain indicators say Solana is approaching a death cross for the third time in its history. The death cross is a bearish signal, occurring when the 50-day moving average crosses below the 200-day moving average. Achieving a death cross could send Solana price to new lows with previous occurrences proving extremely bearish. The first death cross in 2022 saw prices fall by over 90%, exacerbated by FTX‚Äôs implosion. The second death cross in 2022 saw prices take a nose dive before staging a recovery during the ‚ÄúTrump pump.‚Äù Experts say projections for SOL to reach $200 are unlikely as it trades at a six-month low. At the moment, Solana price is trading at $126.53 down by nearly 15% over the last week. For now, traders are proceeding with caution with the biggest indicator being a steep drop in daily trading volume. Over the last 24 hours, trading volume has fallen by 22.71% to settle at $4.1 billion.

OKX Europe is making significant strides in the regulated digital asset space. The exchange has strategically acquired a MiFID II-licensed firm in Malta, signaling a bold move towards offering regulated crypto derivatives to its European users. This development underscores OKX‚Äôs commitment to compliance and expansion within the European market, but what does this mean for the future of crypto trading in the region? Let‚Äôs dive into the details. OKX Europe‚Äôs Strategic Acquisition: A Game Changer? OKX Europe‚Äôs recent acquisition of a MiFID II-licensed firm in Malta is more than just a business deal; it‚Äôs a strategic maneuver designed to solidify its position in the European cryptocurrency market. This move is specifically aimed at enabling OKX to offer regulated crypto derivatives to its European customer base. Why is this significant? Regulatory Compliance: Operating under a MiFID II license demonstrates OKX‚Äôs commitment to adhering to European regulatory standards. This is crucial for building trust and legitimacy in the eyes of both users and regulators. Expansion of Services: The acquisition paves the way for OKX Europe to broaden its service offerings beyond spot trading, venturing into the lucrative and complex world of crypto derivatives. Market Access: A MiFID II license provides a robust framework for operating within the European financial market, opening doors to a wider audience of institutional and retail investors. However, it‚Äôs important to note that while the acquisition is a major step, OKX still needs to secure final approval from the Malta Financial Services Authority (MFSA). This regulatory nod is essential before OKX can officially commence operations under the MiFID II license later this year. Decoding the MiFID II License: What Does It Mean? MiFID II, or the Markets in Financial Instruments Directive II, is a cornerstone of the European Union‚Äôs financial regulation. But what exactly does a MiFID II License entail, and why is it so valuable for a cryptocurrency exchange like OKX? Essentially, MiFID II is designed to: Increase Transparency: It aims to make financial markets more transparent by imposing stricter reporting requirements and trading rules. Enhance Investor Protection: A core objective is to protect investors by ensuring firms act in their clients‚Äô best interests and provide appropriate levels of information and safeguards. Promote Fair Competition: MiFID II seeks to foster fair and efficient markets by regulating trading venues and investment firms across the EU. For OKX Europe, holding a MiFID II license means operating under a well-established regulatory framework that is recognized and respected across Europe. This license is not just a piece of paper; it‚Äôs a testament to OKX‚Äôs commitment to operating at a high standard of regulatory compliance, which is particularly important when dealing with complex financial products like crypto derivatives . Why Malta? The Allure of a Crypto-Friendly Nation Malta has long been recognized as a progressive jurisdiction in the cryptocurrency and blockchain space. Why did OKX choose Malta for this strategic expansion? Malta offers several key advantages that make it an attractive location for crypto businesses: Pro-Innovation Regulatory Environment: Malta was one of the first EU member states to establish a comprehensive legal framework for blockchain and cryptocurrencies, earning it the moniker ‚ÄúBlockchain Island.‚Äù EU Membership: Being part of the European Union allows companies based in Malta to benefit from EU-wide market access and regulatory harmonization. Talent Pool: Malta has cultivated a growing ecosystem of professionals with expertise in blockchain, fintech, and regulatory compliance. Favorable Tax Regime: Malta offers a competitive tax system that can be advantageous for international businesses. By acquiring a firm in Malta, OKX Europe is strategically positioning itself within a jurisdiction that is both crypto-friendly and compliant with European standards. This move leverages Malta‚Äôs supportive environment to facilitate its expansion into regulated crypto derivatives offerings. The Future of Crypto Derivatives in Europe: What to Expect? OKX Europe‚Äôs move comes at a pivotal time for the European cryptocurrency market. With the upcoming Markets in Crypto Assets (MiCA) regulation, the landscape is rapidly evolving. How will this acquisition and the focus on regulatory approval impact the availability and accessibility of crypto derivatives in Europe? Here‚Äôs what we can anticipate: Aspect Potential Impact Increased Regulatory Clarity MiCA and national licenses like MiFID II will provide clearer guidelines for crypto firms, fostering a more stable and predictable operating environment. Enhanced Investor Confidence Regulation can boost investor confidence by providing a level of protection and oversight that is currently lacking in many parts of the crypto market. Growth of Institutional Participation Regulatory frameworks can encourage institutional investors to enter the crypto derivatives market, bringing in greater liquidity and maturity. Product Innovation As regulatory clarity increases, we may see more innovative and sophisticated crypto derivative products tailored to the European market. However, challenges remain. Navigating the complex web of European and national regulations, ensuring compliance, and educating users about the risks and complexities of crypto derivatives will be ongoing tasks for OKX and other players in the space. Navigating Regulatory Hurdles: The Path to Approval While the acquisition of a MiFID II-licensed firm is a significant achievement, the journey isn‚Äôt over yet for OKX Europe. Securing regulatory approval from the MFSA is the next crucial step. What does this process typically involve, and what are the potential hurdles? The MFSA approval process will likely involve: Due Diligence: The MFSA will conduct thorough due diligence on OKX Europe, assessing its financial stability, operational capabilities, and compliance frameworks. Compliance Checks: Rigorous checks will be carried out to ensure OKX‚Äôs operations align with MiFID II requirements and Maltese regulations. Risk Management Assessment: The MFSA will evaluate OKX‚Äôs risk management systems and controls, particularly in relation to the offering of crypto derivatives. Ongoing Supervision: Even after approval, OKX will be subject to ongoing supervision by the MFSA to ensure continued compliance. The successful completion of this regulatory approval process is paramount for OKX to realize its ambitions of offering regulated crypto derivatives in Europe. The industry will be watching closely to see how this progresses, as it could set a precedent for other exchanges seeking to expand their regulated offerings in the region. Conclusion: A Strategic Win for OKX and European Crypto? OKX Europe‚Äôs acquisition of a MiFID II-licensed firm in Malta is undoubtedly a strategic win for the exchange, positioning it favorably to tap into the growing European market for regulated crypto derivatives . This move, coupled with its earlier MiCA registration, signals a clear commitment to operating within the bounds of European regulation and providing a compliant platform for its users. While final regulatory approval is still pending, this development represents a significant step forward for OKX Europe and potentially for the broader adoption of regulated crypto derivatives in Europe. As the regulatory landscape continues to evolve, OKX‚Äôs proactive approach could pave the way for a more mature and accessible crypto market in the region.

The Bolivian media outlet Urgente reported that President Luis Arce‚Äôs cabinet has also given YPFB the go-ahead to purchase US dollars from domestic financial institutions, including the state-run bank Banco Uni√≥n. Bolivia: Crypto Move The Cabinet noted that YPFB was free to use USD or crypto to conduct fuel import-related deals with overseas vendors. YPFB engineers at a facility in Bolivia. (Source: YPFB/Facebook) The government issued a special decree permitting the firm to use crypto and USD specifically to buy ‚Äúcrude oil and diesel.‚Äù The firm can also use crypto to buy related products that can be used to refine gasoline. Arce‚Äôs crisis-hit government has been locked in a standoff with Bolivia‚Äôs Former President Evo Morales since last year. Clashes between groups loyal to Arce and those who support Morales have led to armed takeovers of military posts and road blockades. Arce‚Äôs government has also been best with problems in the Bolivian parliament, the Plurinational Legislative Assembly. La Paz says this has ‚Äúimpeded the entry of foreign currency‚Äù by ‚Äúblocking the approval of loans totaling over $1.667 billion.‚Äù This has left YPFB short of the foreign currency it needs to pay for fuel imports. In turn, this has led to a drop in supplies of both diesel and gasoline.

Experts think countries fighting sanctions regimes are now turning to crypto as a payments tool. The government of Iran approved the use of crypto for imports in 2022, with some in Moscow calling Tehran a ‚Äúpioneer‚Äù in crypto-powered trade. Venezuela has also used crypto in fossil fuel trade deals. This, at one stage, led to the Nicol√°s Maduro-led government reportedly amassing a huge ‚Äústash‚Äù of Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) coins.

Many believe that Russian oil firms have made extensive use of crypto. Moscow has also openly spoken about using crypto to bypass US, EU, and UK sanctions for both imports and exports. Last year, the Bolivian lawmaker Mariela Baldivieso said farmers in the country could soon start using crypto as a remittance tool .

Coinbase, one of the world‚Äôs leading cryptocurrency exchanges, has just dropped a bombshell announcement. Buckle up, because they‚Äôre listing Aethir (ATH)! This news, revealed on X, has sent ripples of excitement throughout the crypto community. Mark your calendars for March 13th at 9:00 a.m. (PT) ‚Äì that‚Äôs when the Coinbase listing ATH goes live. But what exactly is Aethir, and why is this listing such a big deal? Let‚Äôs dive into the details. What is Aethir and the Buzz Around ATH? Aethir is not just another cryptocurrency project; it‚Äôs a platform focused on something truly groundbreaking: decentralized GPU usage. In a world increasingly reliant on processing power for everything from AI to gaming, Aethir is stepping in to democratize access to GPUs. Imagine a future where GPU resources are readily available and distributed, rather than concentrated in the hands of a few. That‚Äôs the vision Aethir is working towards. The ATH token is the lifeblood of this ecosystem. Think of it as the fuel that powers the Aethir network. It serves as the primary medium of exchange within the Aethir ecosystem, facilitating transactions and incentivizing participation. As the platform grows, the utility of the ATH token is expected to increase, making this Coinbase listing ATH announcement even more significant. Why is the Coinbase Listing ATH a Game Changer? Coinbase listing ATH is more than just adding another token to a crypto exchange. It‚Äôs a validation and a massive leap forward for Aethir and the concept of decentralized GPUs. Here‚Äôs why this listing is generating so much excitement: Increased Visibility and Accessibility: Coinbase is a giant in the crypto world, known for its user-friendly platform and broad reach. Listing ATH on Coinbase instantly exposes Aethir to millions of potential users and investors who may not have been aware of the project before. This increased visibility is crucial for adoption and growth. Enhanced Liquidity: A listing on a major exchange like Coinbase typically leads to a significant boost in liquidity. This means it will be easier to buy and sell ATH tokens, making it more attractive for traders and investors. Higher liquidity can also contribute to price stability and reduce volatility. Credibility and Trust: Coinbase has a rigorous vetting process for listing new tokens. Their decision to list ATH signals a level of confidence in the project‚Äôs legitimacy, technology, and potential. This endorsement can significantly enhance Aethir‚Äôs credibility within the often skeptical crypto space. Mainstream Adoption of Decentralized GPUs: By listing ATH, Coinbase is indirectly promoting the concept of decentralized GPUs to a mainstream audience. This can accelerate the adoption of this innovative technology and pave the way for a more distributed and accessible computing future. Decentralized GPUs: Unlocking the Power of Distributed Computing The concept of decentralized GPUs might sound technical, but its implications are far-reaching. Here‚Äôs a simplified look at why decentralized GPUs are so important: Democratizing Access to Computing Power: Currently, access to high-performance GPUs is often limited and expensive. Decentralized GPU networks aim to break down these barriers, making powerful computing resources available to anyone, anywhere.

Security researchers have discovered over the last few months that the group has been sabotaging malicious npm packages that steal credentials, exfiltrate cryptocurrency wallet data, and create a persistent backdoor in development environments. It marks a major escalation in their years-long cyberwar, which has already witnessed some of the biggest crypto heists in history. According to a new investigation by the Socket Research Team , a branch of Lazarus Group has penetrated the npm repository, one of the most popular package managers for JavaScript developers. The hackers then used typosquatting techniques to publish malicious versions of popular npm packages, deceiving unsuspecting developers into downloading the programs. The packages include is-buffer-validator, yoojae-validator, event-handle-package, array-empty-validator, react-event-dependency, and auth-validator. When executed, the compromised packages install BeaverTail malware. This ‚Äúadvanced‚Äù tool can steal login credentials, search through browser files for saved passwords and dump files from cryptocurrency wallets, such as Solana and Exodus. Security researchers noted that the stolen data were sent to the hardcoded command-and-control (C2) server, a common modus operandi employed by the Lazarus Group to relay confidential data back to their actors. Its purpose is to steal and transmit compromised data without being detected, and it was particularly threatening in the world of developers building financial and blockchain applications, says Kirill Boychenko, a threat intelligence analyst at Socket Security. Lazarus launched an offensive against Bybit, stealing nearly $1.46 billion In addition to these supply chain attacks, Lazarus Group has also been tied to one of the biggest cryptocurrency thefts on record. Its first action is suspected to have occurred on February 21, 2025, when group-linked hackers breached Bybit, one of the world‚Äôs biggest crypto exchanges, making off with an estimated $1.46 billion in crypto assets. The attack was extremely sophisticated and was allegedly launched from a compromised device of a Safe{Wallet} employee, a Bybit technology partner. Hackers leveraged a vulnerability in the infrastructure of Bybit‚Äôs Ethereum wallet and altered smart contract logic to redirect funds to their wallets. Although Bybit addressed the problem immediately, a statement from CEO Ben Zhou revealed that 20% of the stolen money had already been laundered via mixing services and was untraceable. This latest series of attacks is part of North Korea‚Äôs broader effort to evade international sanctions against it by stealing and laundering cryptocurrency. According to a 2024 United Nations report, North Korean cybercriminals were responsible for over 35% of global cryptocurrency thefts over the past year, accumulating over $1 billion in stolen assets. Lazarus Group is not just a cybercrime syndicate but also a geopolitics threat since stolen money is reportedly directly funnelled into the nation‚Äôs nuclear weapons and ballistic missile programs. Such Lazarus Group attacks have also progressed over the years, from direct exchange hacks to supply chain attacks and even developer and software repository attacks. By adding backdoors to open-source platforms like npm, PyPI, and GitHub, the group expands its potential attack range to many systems, eliminating the need to hack directly into cryptocurrency exchanges. Security experts are calling for stricter protections for crypto developers Noting these growing risks, cyber specialists are pushing for stricter security for developers and crypto users and protection from hackers. One such best practice is verifying the realness of npm packages before installation because typosquatting continues to be one of the most common methods cyber criminals use. Socket AI Scanner also tracks anomalies in your software dependencies or npm audit, which informs you whether any compromised packages are in use and allows you to remove them from your application before they can do any real damage. The guide recommends that users and developers take the initiative to protect themselves by enabling multi-factor authentication (MFA) for exchange wallets, developer platforms like GitHub, and other accounts. Network monitoring is now regarded as the first line of defence as the compromised system will usually send messages back to an external command and control (C2) server, which then uploads the malicious updates on the infected computer. Blocking illegitimate outbound traffic can cut hackers‚Äô access to this stolen data. Bybit launches recovery bounty as crypto security battle heats up Following the Bybit hack, the exchange also initiated a Recovery Bounty Program, rewarding anyone who helps find the stolen assets. The program allows for rewards of up to 10% of the money recovered. At the same time, the larger crypto ecosystem is busy ramping up security practices and alerting developers to protect against the same practices that can lead down this threatening path. But as Lazarus Group‚Äôs tactics advance ever more quickly, network defenders say the war on crypto has only just begun.

This shortage is due to the dwindling exports of natural gases over the years. Up until June 2024, Bolivia‚Äôs central bank, Banco Central de Bolivia had a ban placed on Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. At the time, the bank cited Bolivia‚Äôs struggling economy as the reason for the ban. It also stated that the ban would align the country with Latin American crypto regulations. The ban was lifted for a simpler reason ‚Äî the global acceptance of cryptocurrencies. Other Latin American countries such as El Salvador, Argentina, Brazil, and Mexico had adopted the use of cryptocurrencies before Bolivia jumped on the wagon. With its economy still struggling and the reduction in exports, the country is again turning to cryptocurrency as a way out. Cryptocurrency for energy According to Reuters , a spokesperson for the state-run energy firm YPFB revealed that a system to use cryptocurrency to purchase fuel imports has been put in place. The energy firm also said that it had received government approval to use digital assets to help meet demand. Despite the government‚Äôs approval, YPFB has not yet used digital currency to purchase energy imports, but it intends to do so, according to a government spokesperson. Bolivia is catching up to other countries within South America with its increased acceptance and adoption of cryptocurrency and digital assets. Countries such as El Salvador and Argentina are integrating digital assets into their financial systems. Argentina‚Äôs state-owned energy firm, YPF, ventured into crypto mining operations in 2022 and has been supplying power for mining activities while making plans to further expand its crypto mining operations. Brazil established a law regulating digital assets in December 2022, and it came into effect in June 2023. The aim of the regulation was to legalize crypto as a payment method. Bolivia fuel shortages Bolivia‚Äôs economy is largely dependent on its vast natural resources. The country‚Äôs primary export is natural gas, but it also exports gold, zinc, and silver among other commodities. Bolivia‚Äôs natural gas exports were valued at $2.05B in 2023 and while this might sound like an impressive amount, those figures are a whopping 31% less than the value of Bolivia‚Äôs natural gas exports from the previous year which was valued at approximately $2.97B. Following the descending trend, the value of natural gas exports from Bolivia in 2021 was also higher than that of 2022. The exports of natural gas from Bolivia are typically imported by Argentina and Brazil. Over the years, the country has been experiencing a significant decline in its exports of natural gas, and as a result, has witnessed a decrease in its foreign currency reserves. This shortage of dollars has rendered the country incapable of regular function as it uses the US dollar to import goods, fuel included. The lack of dollars led to a fuel crisis in the country, and now, long lines at gas stations and scattered protests are becoming a norm. Bolivia functioned as a net energy exporter due to its large reserves of gas. The country also utilized its natural resources domestically. However, with the diminishing production, it has become reliant on imports to meet the country‚Äôs energy consumption needs. Cryptopolitan Academy: Tired of market swings?

National regulatory bodies across the European Union deliberated on the issue during a meeting led by the European Securities and Markets Authority‚Äôs (ESMA) Digital Finance Standing Committee on March 6. OKX Faces Intense Scrutiny The focus of the inquiry is OKX‚Äôs Web3 service, which happens to be a decentralized finance (DeFi) platform and self-custodial wallet that facilitates access to multiple blockchains and exchanges. Reports indicate that hackers, allegedly tied to North Korea, funneled approximately $100 million in stolen cryptocurrency through this platform. Bloomberg report suggests that authorities are now assessing whether OKX‚Äôs Web3 service falls under the jurisdiction of the EU‚Äôs newly implemented Markets in Cryptoassets (MiCA) regulation, which aims to oversee digital asset providers and ensure compliance with financial security measures. Some regulators, particularly from Austria and Croatia, argued that OKX‚Äôs Web3 service should be subject to MiCA‚Äôs regulatory framework despite fully decentralized platforms being exempt under the rules that came into force in late 2024. A key point of discussion at the meeting was whether the platform‚Äôs integration into OKX‚Äôs main website and its connection to an OKX Singapore entity constituted grounds for enforcement under MiCA. A regulatory presentation at the meeting reportedly outlined how OKX‚Äôs user interface enables token swaps and wallet connections directly through its website, suggesting centralized oversight rather than a purely decentralized model. Additionally, officials raised concerns about potential violations of sanctions against North Korea, given the laundering activities linked to the attack. The outcome of this regulatory scrutiny could lead to penalties for the crypto and further discussions on the application of EU financial laws to similar platforms. OKX Responds OKX has firmly rejected claims, calling the Bloomberg report misleading. The exchange clarified that its Web3 wallet and swap features function similarly to those of other major crypto platforms, and serve as aggregators to improve user efficiency rather than facilitating illicit transactions. According to OKX, its immediate response to the Bybit breach included freezing related funds on its centralized exchange and introducing a new tool to detect and block hacker-linked addresses from accessing its decentralized exchange or wallet services. The company expressed disappointment over Bybit‚Äôs statements and argued that they contributed to misinformation by wrongly implying an investigation into OKX. It even went on to emphasize that regulatory scrutiny is not directed at its operations but rather stems from broader industry discussions on decentralized finance regulations. Additionally, OKX suggested that the real issue lies in Bybit‚Äôs security shortcomings, rather than any wrongdoing on its part. The exchange strongly refuted what it described as false claims that misrepresented its role in the aftermath of the cyberattack.

Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong has stated that more government institutions are showing interest in digital assets, with a growing number engaging in trading, custody, and blockchain applications. Coinbase CEO: US Bitcoin Reserve Sparks More Government Crypto Adoption In a recent post on X platform, Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong announced that the company now collaborates with 145 government entities in the United States and 29 internationally. The company provides services such as custody, trading, and blockchain infrastructure to these institutions. Cobase CEO Armstrong noted that the launch of the U.S. Strategic Bitcoin Reserve has accelerated interest from government bodies. More institutions are looking to integrate digital assets into their financial frameworks. The top crypto exchange has positioned itself as a primary partner for public-sector organizations seeking to engage with crypto securely. More so, just days ago, the exchange secured its registration with the Financial Intelligence Unit (FIU), marking a key step toward resuming operations in India . Coinbase‚Äôs return follows a period of regulatory adjustments in the country. India‚Äôs crypto market, with its growing adoption, presents an opportunity for the exchange‚Äôs expansion. Government Partnerships for Crypto Services Coinbase has built relationships with multiple government entities at the federal, state, and local levels. The company provides custody solutions, trading infrastructure, and blockchain integration services to these institutions. As a publicly traded company, Coinbase adheres to strict regulatory standards. The firm emphasizes compliance and security, which has contributed to its role as a trusted crypto partner for governments worldwide. Notably, Coinbase has safeguarded digital assets for over 13 years without experiencing a security breach. The company employs advanced encryption methods, multi-factor authentication, and physical security measures to protect digital holdings. Governments are not only interested in Bitcoin as a store of value but also in blockchain technology for operational improvements. Public institutions are exploring the use of blockchain for secure transactions, record-keeping, and financial management. Coinbase CEO revealed the Exchange offers, portfolio management, due diligence, and technical solutions to support government entities in their crypto adoption. Additionally, most recently, Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong shared that the top crypto exchange plans to accelerate its U.S. expansion by hiring 1,000 employees in 2025. This decision comes as regulatory clarity improves, allowing Coinbase to focus on growth rather than legal uncertainties.

This came as he revealed a critical technical indicator, which has turned bearish for the flagship crypto, although he noted that BTC bulls can still invalidate this current bearish setup. Bitcoin Price At Risk Of Further Crash As S&P Monthly LMACD Turns Bearish In an X post, Severino indicated that the Bitcoin price could crash further as the S&P 500 monthly LMACD has begun to cross bearish and the histogram has turned red. This development is significant as IntoTheBlock data shows that BTC and the stock market still have a strong positive price correlation. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Action Says Bottom Is In, Analyst Reveals What‚Äôs Coming The crypto analyst stated that BTC bulls can turn this bearish setup for the Bitcoin price in the next 20 days, as diverging would lead to a bullish setup instead. However, the Bulls‚Äô failure to turn this around for Bitcoin could lead to a massive decline for the flagship crypto, worse than it has already witnessed. Severino stated that a confirmation of this bearish setup at the end of the month could kick off a bear market or Black Swan type event similar to what happened when the last two crossovers occurred. It is worth mentioning that BTC has already crashed to as low as $76,000 recently, sparking concerns that the bear market might already be here. However, crypto experts such as BitMEX co-founder Arthur Hayes have suggested that the bull market is still well in play for the Bitcoin price. Hayes noted that BTC has corrected around 30% from its current all-time high (ATH), which he remarked is normal in a bull run. The BitMEX founder predicts that the flagship crypto will rebound once the US Federal Reserve begins to ease its monetary policies. BTC Still Looking Good Despite Recent Crash Crypto analyst Kevin Capital has suggested that the Bitcoin price still looks good despite the recent crash. In his latest market update, he stated that BTC remains the best-looking chart and that everything is going according to plan for the flagship crypto. The analyst predicts that Bitcoin could still come down and test the range between $70,000 and $75,000, which he claims would still be completely fine. Related Reading: Bitcoin 77% Correction To $25,000, Will History Repeat Itself Kevin Capital remarked that the Bitcoin price could remain afloat if it holds a key market structure and the 3-day MACD resets. He added that some decent macro data could help the flagship crypto stay above key support levels. The US CPI data will be released today, which could provide some relief for the market if it shows that inflation is slowing. The analyst is confident that one good inflation report and the FOMC can help turn the tides. At the time of writing, the Bitcoin price is trading at around $81,860, up over 2% in the last 24 hours, according to data from CoinMarketCap.

Data from Ethereum block explorer shows the MEV attack occurred on decentralized exchange Uniswap v3‚Äôs USDC-USDT liquidity pool, where $19.8 million worth of value is locked. Details of the sandwich attack transaction. Source: Etherscan The MEV bot front-ran the transaction by swapping all the USDC liquidity out of the Uniswap v3 USDC-USDT pool and then put it back in after the transaction was executed, according to founder of The DeFi Report Michael Nadeau. The attacker tipped Ethereum block builder ‚Äúbob-the-builder.eth‚Äù $200,000 from the $220,764 swap and profited $8,000 themselves, Nadeau said. DeFi researcher ‚ÄúDeFiac‚Äù speculates the same trader using different wallets has fallen victim to a total of six sandwich attacks, citing ‚Äúinternal tools.‚Äù They pointed out that all funds traveled from borrowing and lending protocol Aave before being deposited on Uniswap. Two of the wallets fell victim to an MEV bot sandwich attack on March 12 at around 9:00 am UTC. Ethereum wallet addresses ‚Äú0xDDe‚Ä¶42a6D‚Äù and ‚Äú0x999‚Ä¶1D215‚Äù were sandwich attacked for $138,838 and $128,003 in transactions that occurred three to four minutes earlier. Both transactors made the same swap in the Uniswap v3 liquidity pool as the trader who made the $220,762 transfer. Others speculate the trades could be attempts at money laundering . ‚ÄúIf you have NK illicit funds you could construct a very mev-able tx, then privately send it to a mev bot and have them arb it in a bundle,‚Äù said founder of crypto data dashboard DefiLlama, 0xngmi. ‚ÄúThat way you wash all the money with close to 0 losses.‚Äù Related: THORChain at crossroads: Decentralization clashes with illicit activity While initially criticizing Uniswap, Nadeau later acknowledged that the transactions didn‚Äôt come from Uniswap's front end, which has MEV protection and default slippage settings.
