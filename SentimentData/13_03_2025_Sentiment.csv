According to a post shared on X, the company has bought 188 Bitcoin for $17.1 million at an average of $91,000 per Bitcoin. This investment is part of Rumble‚Äôs new treasury strategy, with plans to allocate up to $20 million toward Bitcoin acquisitions. Rumble Strengthens Ties with the Crypto Community The Canada-based gaming and streaming company has built a reputation as a platform that supports decentralized technology. The company‚Äôs decision to add Bitcoin to its balance sheets shows its support for the crypto sector while diversifying its investments beyond traditional markets. Rumble‚Äôs CEO, Chris Pavlovski, explained that Bitcoin can help protect finance against inflation. He pointed out that, unlike regular money governments can print endlessly, Bitcoin has a fixed supply, making it a valuable alternative. The company also mentioned that it may buy more Bitcoin in the future, depending on market conditions, Bitcoin‚Äôs price, and its financial situation. The investment aligns with its broader push into cloud services and alternative media, where blockchain and digital assets are becoming increasingly relevant. Rumble‚Äôs latest Bitcoin comes after Senator Cynthia Lummis reintroduced the national Bitcoin reserves bill days after President Donald Trump signed an executive order to establish a digital asset stockpile. Rumble‚Äôs Stock Increases Amid Financial Implications After the announcement, Rumble‚Äôs stock (RUM) rose 2.7% in Nasdaq‚Äôs pre-market trading. However, some financial experts worry that Rumble bought Bitcoin when the price was too high. Right now, Bitcoin is trading at $82,664, which means Rumble‚Äôs investment is down by 10.33%, losing about $1.77 million in paper value. Despite this short-term, the company seems confident that Bitcoin will grow in value over time. A Growing Presence in Corporate Bitcoin Holdings With this purchase, Rumble is now the 40th largest company holding Bitcoin, according to the Bitcoin Treasuries tracker. Its Bitcoin now makes up 0.60% of its total market value, showing its strong interest in digital money. This move comes after Rumble received a $775 million investment from Tether , the company behind the USDT stablecoin, in December 2024. As Bitcoin and stablecoins become more important to its business, Rumble balances media, cloud technology, and crypto adoption.

This move allows the company to introduce regulated derivative products and services for institutional clients across the European Economic Area (EEA), pending Malta Financial Services Authority (MFSA) approval. The regulation news was made during an exclusive event on Manoel Island, Malta, as part of OKX‚Äôs strategy to strengthen its presence in the European market. OKX Acquires MiFID II License To Expand In Europe According to a recent announcement , OKX secured a MiFID II license through the acquisition of a Malta-based firm that holds the regulatory approval. The entity will become operational later this year after receiving clearance from the Malta Financial Services Authority (MFSA). The MiFID II license will allow OKX to introduce regulated derivatives and investment solutions for institutional clients across the EEA. This move will enhance institutional market access while maintaining compliance with European financial regulations. Previously, OKX received a full Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA) license, enabling the exchange to provide localized crypto trading services across 30 EU member states. The MiCA license supports various offerings, including spot trading, over-the-counter (OTC) trading, and automated trading solutions. Amid these regulation news, earlier this month, top crypto exchange Binance announced that it would be delisting all non-MiCA-compliant stablecoin trading pairs for users in the EEA. Institutional Offerings With Regulatory Compliance OKX‚Äôs expansion under MiFID II aims to align digital assets with traditional financial markets. The company intends to provide institutional-grade services that meet European compliance standards. The newly acquired license will help OKX partner with tier-one financial institutions and introduce new regulated investment products. With the MiFID II approval, OKX plans to integrate additional risk management features and trading solutions tailored for institutional investors. The exchange seeks to offer advanced derivatives products while ensuring security in line with European regulations. Additionally, OKX‚Äôs institutional clients will gain access to new derivatives trading services under the MiFID II license. The platform currently supports trading for over 240 cryptocurrency tokens, 300 trading pairs, and 60 euro-based trading pairs. Concurrently, the top crypto exchange plans to expand its fiat on-ramp options. The company allows users to deposit and withdraw euros at no cost through bank transfers while supporting card payments and other local payment methods. More so, the exchange‚Äôs website and mobile app are designed to support local languages, currency displays, and customer service tailored to each European market. The company is set to introduce more localized services, including streamlined Know Your Customer (KYC) processes. Reacting to the regulation news, Erald Ghoos, OKX Europe CEO added, ‚ÄúWith this license, we are set to deliver institutional-grade services, partner with tier 1 financial institutions, and offer regulated investment solutions that enhance market access and empower investors across the continent.‚Äù The post OKX Expands Institutional Offerings In Europe With MiFID II License appeared first on CoinGape .",24/7 Cryptocurrency News|Regulation News,EN,0,0,TRADING|EXCHANGE|MARKET|REGULATION|BUSINESS,"{'name': 'CoinGape', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coingape.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coingape,2025-03-12 22:34:13

With that move, OKX will be able to offer a wider selection of derivative products to traders from the Euro Area. OKX Europe will gain a MiFID II license for operating in the Euro Area, after acquiring a company already registered with Malta‚Äôs financial authorities. Acquisitions have been the main approach of exchange operators in becoming compliant with EU financial regulations. The Markets in Financial Instruments Directive regulation is one of the key documents setting up the requirements for crypto exchanges.

Learn more: https://t.co/xswBXeyCSF pic.twitter.com/Z7p7tcOuMe ‚Äî OKX (@okx) March 12, 2025 OKX announced the acquisition during an official event in Malta. OKX aims to expand during the current market cycle, by reaching traders of all levels. The exchange has already become the first market operator to become compliant with the Markets in Crypto-Asset (MiCA) Regulation, receiving a pre-authorization status. Currently, OKX is working toward becoming fully MiCA compliant. OKX aims to reach all 28 countries in the European Union, bringing OTC, spot trading, automated, and copy-trading for over 240 tokens in 300 trading pairs. OKX also offers fiat-based pairs against the Euro. The main effect of the MiFID license will be the introduction of advanced derivatives and futures markets. OKX will be able to serve institutional clients with sophisticated trading tools. The exchange is also working toward localization in multiple European languages. The customers of OKX will also be able to deposit and withdraw Euro at no cost through a Euro Area bank transfer. The exchange will offer crypto purchases using cards and other localized payment methods. As a MiFID platform, OKX will offer easier KYC verification, with access to more diverse payment gateways. OKX will continue to announce the new features as they become active. Exchanges target Euro Area for growth OKX is one of the leading exchanges based on trust score. The market operator carried volumes of $3.7B and lined up among the most active centralized markets. Most of the traffic for OKX comes from outside the Euro Area. Visitors from Brazil are the most active, followed by US traders making up 8.2% of site visits. OKX also services crypto-friendly regions and countries, including Vietnam, the Philippines, and Turkey. The recent acquisition aims to expand the services of OKX to a new and highly active crypto market. While smaller, the European market is well-regulated. During the latest bull cycle, investors from Germany, France, and the UK joined some of the latest trends, including memes and prediction markets on Polymarket. EU countries have a lower rank in terms of crypto adoption, lagging behind the USA, as revealed by Chainalysis data . Despite this, OKX aims to tap Europe as a growth market, with increasing crypto adoption. Up to 30.7M European traders have some contact with the crypto market, or non-zero holdings. Major exchanges aim to bring reliable services and a fully regulated market with compliant stablecoin pairings. OKX investigated for the laundering of the Bybit hack funds OKX has been scrutinized for its decentralized services, especially its Web3 wallet. During the Bybit hack, the decentralized service was used to launder a part of the funds, which OKX did not block or freeze. Decentralized services and wallets are still a gray area for regulators, but may be one of the new areas to include under the MiCA compliance requirements. The OKX Web3 wallet is borderless and permissionless, serving as an aggregator and access point to decentralized trading. The ability to scrutinize and freeze transactions remains limited. OKX has only partnered by freezing and blacklisting funds through its centralized exchange. OKX claims its decentralized service is not a part of the exchange‚Äôs main product package. Currently, the service is under investigation in the EU. While OKX Europe is allowed to offer basic services from its Malta headquarters, the investigation of its DEX and Web3 unit may lead to a loss of permission for some operations in the Euro Area.

After reaching a three-day high of $84,437, BTC/USD quickly reversed course as bearish pressure emerged. The U.S. Consumer Price Index (CPI) for January came in below expectations at 2.8%, signaling a slowdown in inflation. Core CPI, which excludes volatile food and energy prices, fell to 3.1%‚Äîalso lower than expected. ‚ÄúThis marks the first decline in both Headline and Core CPI since July 2024. Inflation is cooling down in the US,‚Äù noted The Kobeissi Letter, a trading analysis firm. Despite this seemingly positive data, Wall Street‚Äôs opening saw renewed selling pressure across the cryptocurrency market. Bitcoin fell to $82,400 before stabilizing around its daily opening price. Technical Indicators and Market Trends Popular crypto analyst Rekt Capital pointed out that Bitcoin has started to exit a previously filled CME Gap‚Äîan important price zone linked to Bitcoin futures trading on CME Group. ‚ÄúAny dips into the top of the CME Gap would constitute a post-breakout retest attempt to fully confirm the exit from this CME Gap. Initial signs of that retest occurring already,‚Äù he explained. Other analysts focused on key technical indicators such as the 200-day Simple and Exponential Moving Averages (SMA/EMA), which serve as crucial support levels in bull markets. ‚ÄúBulls got work to do here to get back above the Daily 200MA/EMA. Last year we had the same thing and price chopped around these levels for 3+ months,‚Äù noted trader Daan Crypto Trades. Currently, these levels sit at $83,550 and $85,650, respectively. Bitcoin ETF Outflows Indicate Institutional Caution On the macroeconomic front, trading firm QCP Capital suggested that the CPI data could influence the Federal Reserve‚Äôs upcoming decision on interest rates. ‚ÄúWith inflation concerns lingering and macro risks mounting, the CPI print will be a key determinant of whether the disinflationary trend will hold, or volatility intensifies in the near term,‚Äù QCP stated in its latest market update. Institutional investors are also showing signs of caution. Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) experienced a significant net outflow of $153.87 million, largely driven by Grayscale‚Äôs Bitcoin Trust (GBTC). GBTC offloaded 641 BTC worth $56.45 million, bringing its total holdings down to 195,746 BTC, valued at approximately $17.24 billion. ‚ÄúThis signals growing caution among institutional investors,‚Äù QCP concluded. Looking Ahead: Market Uncertainty Persists With inflation concerns still present and institutional investors adopting a more cautious approach, Bitcoin‚Äôs short-term price action remains uncertain. However, key support levels around $82,000 appear to be holding for now. As traders and investors navigate these developments, all eyes remain on the Federal Reserve‚Äôs upcoming policy decisions and how they might impact broader market sentiment.",Bitcoin|Crypto News Today|Crypto Intelligence,EN,0,0,BTC|TRADING|MARKET|BUSINESS|FIAT,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2025-03-12 22:45:38

While some market participants see President Donald Trump‚Äôs latest executive order as overshadowed by economic uncertainty, K33 analysts insist the initiative is far from insignificant. K33 Head of Research Vetle Lunde and Senior Analyst David Zimmerman noted in a report that the ETH/BTC ratio has also reached its lowest point since December 2020, highlighting Ethereum‚Äôs relative underperformance. Analysts noted that Trump appeared unconcerned about recession risks, instead focusing on lowering U.S. 10-year Treasury yields to help the government refinancing efforts. That, combined with uncertainty about the administration‚Äôs changing stance on tariffs, led to declines in the S&P 500 and Nasdaq, both of which reached their lowest levels since mid-September. Despite these challenges, Bitcoin has gained about 13% since the presidential election, outperforming the Nasdaq and S&P 500, which have both returned negative over the same period. Lunde and Zimmerman attribute this resilience to Trump‚Äôs steadfast stance on crypto, including the creation of a dedicated crypto working group and the announcement of the U.S. Strategic Bitcoin Reserve last week. Related News: Bitcoin Bull Cathie Wood's Company Speaks About BTC For The First Time After The Fall - Still Bullish? ‚ÄúWe fundamentally disagree with experts who attribute the recent sell-off to the inadequacy of the U.S. Bitcoin reserve,‚Äù the analysts wrote, adding: ‚ÄúThis reserve represents a turning point for Bitcoin. It is an important step in legitimizing BTC as a global store of value despite widespread market volatility. While macroeconomic uncertainties persist, we see the current price environment as a strong opportunity for long-term accumulation.‚Äù Trump‚Äôs executive order signed on March 6 officially established the US Strategic Bitcoin Reserve. The reserve will consist of approximately 200,000 BTC ($17 billion) currently under federal surveillance due to asset seizures related to criminal and civil cases. However, some of these funds must be returned to crime victims, leaving an estimated 103,500 BTC in the reserve at its official launch. In particular, the 94,636 BTC seized in the Bitfinex attack is expected to be returned to the exchange rather than kept in the reserve. ‚ÄúThe most influential global superpower has signaled an end to the Bitcoin seizure sales; neither current nor future seizures will be liquidated,‚Äù the analysts wrote, adding: ‚ÄúFurthermore, the administration is actively exploring ways to accumulate more. This could set a precedent for other countries and signal the beginning of a new era for Bitcoin. Given these developments, we believe the current landscape is extremely favorable for long-term Bitcoin accumulation, while short-term uncertainties remain.‚Äù *This is not investment advice.

Imagine a world where developing sophisticated AI agents becomes significantly easier, thanks to a powerful runtime environment designed from the ground up for distributed systems. That vision is now closer to reality with the latest advancements in Dapr. What is Dapr and Why Does it Matter for AI Agents? Back in 2019, tech giant Microsoft open-sourced Dapr (Distributed Application Runtime), a groundbreaking runtime environment aimed at simplifying the development of distributed, microservice-based applications. While AI agents weren‚Äôt the primary buzzword then, Dapr‚Äôs foundational architecture inherently contained key elements perfectly suited for supporting them. At its core, Dapr features ‚Äòvirtual actors‚Äô ‚Äì independent units that can process messages autonomously. This actor model turns out to be exceptionally well-aligned with the needs of modern AI agents . Now, the Dapr team is taking this a step further with the launch of Dapr Agents . This new initiative is specifically designed to provide developers with the essential building blocks for creating and deploying AI agents effectively. Yaron Schneider, co-creator and maintainer of Dapr, highlights the natural synergy: ‚Äú AI Agents are a very good use case for Dapr . From a technical standpoint, actors offer a lightweight and scalable way to run these agents with state management and resource efficiency. While frameworks and workflow engines exist, they often lack the orchestration and statefulness that Dapr inherently provides.‚Äù Key Benefits of Dapr for AI Agents: Scalability and Efficiency: Dapr‚Äôs actor model enables the creation of highly scalable AI agents that can be efficiently managed and run, optimizing resource utilization. State Management: Built-in state management capabilities ensure AI agents can maintain context and data across interactions, crucial for complex tasks and long-running processes. Orchestration: Dapr provides robust orchestration features to coordinate interactions between AI agents and other components of a distributed system, simplifying complex workflows. Simplified Development: By abstracting away the complexities of distributed systems, Dapr allows developers to focus on the core logic of their AI agents , accelerating development cycles. From Floki to Dapr Agents: An Open Source Evolution The genesis of Dapr Agents lies in Floki, a popular open-source project that extended Dapr to specifically cater to AI agent use cases. Recognizing the potential and community interest, the Dapr and Floki teams, including Microsoft AI researcher Roberto Rodriguez, joined forces to bring Floki under the official Dapr umbrella. This collaboration ensures the continued development and support of this powerful new framework for AI agents . Mark Fussell, another co-creator and maintainer of Dapr, aptly describes the shift in perspective: ‚ÄúIn many ways, we see agentic systems and the terminology around them as another term for ‚Äò distributed systems .‚Äô Rather than calling them microservices, you can now call them agents, especially with the integration of large language models.‚Äù The core principle remains the same: efficient coordination and statefulness are paramount, whether you‚Äôre building microservices or sophisticated AI agents . This is precisely where Dapr excels. How Dapr Empowers Distributed AI Systems Dapr ‚Äòs architecture is ideally suited for the demands of distributed systems , particularly those involving AI agents . Its actor model is designed for extreme efficiency, enabling agents to spin up in milliseconds when a message arrives and gracefully shut down once their task is complete, all while preserving their state. This ephemeral and stateful nature is critical for building responsive and resource-conscious AI applications. Connectivity and Tooling: Broad Model Support: Dapr Agents offer out-of-the-box compatibility with leading model providers, including AWS Bedrock, OpenAI, Anthropic, Mistral, and Hugging Face. Support for local LLMs is also on the horizon. Tool Integration: Extending the existing Dapr framework, Dapr Agents allow developers to define a suite of tools that agents can leverage to accomplish specific tasks. This modularity and extensibility are key to building versatile AI agents . Language Support: Currently, Dapr Agents supports Python, with .NET support launching imminently. Java, JavaScript, and Go support are planned to follow, ensuring broad accessibility for developers across different ecosystems. Unlocking the Potential of Open Source AI with Dapr The introduction of Dapr Agents marks a significant step forward in making open source AI development more accessible and manageable. By providing a robust and scalable runtime environment, Dapr empowers developers to build complex, distributed AI agent applications with greater ease and efficiency. As the AI landscape continues to evolve, tools like Dapr will be instrumental in democratizing access to advanced AI technologies and fostering innovation within the open source AI community. Key Takeaways: Feature Benefit for AI Agents Virtual Actors Scalable and efficient agent execution State Management Persistent agent context and data Orchestration Engine Simplified coordination of complex AI workflows Broad Model Support Integration with leading AI model providers Tool Integration Extensible agent capabilities Embrace the Future of AI with Dapr Dapr ‚Äòs embrace of AI agents signifies a pivotal moment in the evolution of both microservices and artificial intelligence. By leveraging the power of Dapr ‚Äòs runtime, developers can now confidently build and deploy sophisticated AI agent applications that are scalable, resilient, and easier to manage than ever before. This move not only simplifies the development process but also opens up exciting new possibilities for the future of AI in distributed environments.

Kevin points to several convergent technical indicators, including a back test of the macro 0.5 Fibonacci retracement near $0.158, a retest of descending multi‚Äêyear trend lines, a convergence with both the 200‚Äêweek Simple Moving Average (SMA) and Exponential Moving Average (EMA), and an historically low 3‚ÄêDay RSI reading. Buy Dogecoin Now? The DOGE/USD weekly chart reveals several Fibonacci retracement lines that may serve as support or potential downside targets. Around $0.158, Dogecoin is testing the 0.5 Fib level, while deeper areas include 0.618 near $0.1157, 0.65 near $0.1092, 0.70 around $0.097, 0.786 near $0.080, and a more distant 1.0 Fib labeled around $0.0942. Historically, these Fib zones have been areas where price action may stabilize if a downtrend continues. Kevin also highlights resistance near $0.28 (the 0.236 Fib) and an upper boundary around $0.47‚Äì$0.48 that marks a major swing high from previous rallies. From a trend perspective, the price is hovering in the $0.16‚Äì$0.17 region, where it is retesting the broken descending trend line drawn from Dogecoin‚Äôs 2021 peaks. Kevin‚Äôs analysis suggests that if Dogecoin can hold this line as support, it would reinforce the bullish scenario. Related Reading: Dogecoin‚Äôs Darkest Hour? Sentiment Tanks, Whales Accumulate In tandem, the 200‚Äêweek SMA and EMA‚Äîoften regarded as markers of long‚Äêterm market health‚Äîare situated in the approximate $0.13‚Äì$0.17 corridor. The overlap between these critical moving averages and the Fib levels underscores what Kevin sees as a strong risk‚Äêto‚Äêreward setup for long‚Äêterm positioning. He also points out that the 3‚ÄêDay RSI has reached territory he considers ‚Äúhistorically low,‚Äù hinting at a possible oversold condition. Beyond technical considerations, Kevin expresses a broader macroeconomic viewpoint: ‚ÄúIf BTC holds up and Macro Economic Data and Monetary policy adjust then you just got your last opportunity to buy Dogecoin relatively cheap. A lot of factors at play and lots of work to do But the risk reward at this level is superb given the circumstances.‚Äù He suggests that despite strong employment numbers and moderating inflation (supported by Truflation data and falling energy costs), the market is ‚Äúwiping out trillions of dollars of wealth everyday on pure speculation of what imaginary Tariffs are gonna do that they knew were coming.‚Äù Related Reading: Dogecoin Crash? Analyst Predicts Drop To $0.12 Before Rebound He adds: ‚ÄúEmployment numbers are phenomenal, growth is still strong, inflation is coming down rapidly per Truflation data and energy costs falling are the reason, the Fed is about to start easing again, wars are getting ready to end soon.‚Äù He argues that the Federal Reserve may soon pivot to more accommodative policies and that ongoing geopolitical tensions may be waning.

Simultaneously, analysts are highlighting an AI token that appears poised to deliver astronomical returns of 5,437% before June 2025: FloppyPepe (FPPE). Ethereum Price Surge: A Prelude To Bullish Trends The current market indicators suggest that the Ethereum price is poised for a dramatic surge. Analysts report that the huge amounts of Ethereum (ETH) purchased in the last 72 hours, along with the fallout from the Bybit hack, could boost the price. With each progressive update and strategic network upgrade, Ethereum (ETH) is drawing closer to its next significant milestone. Additional market research reveals that a stabilized Ethereum price is likely to attract even more participation from both seasoned and emerging market players. A comprehensive analysis of recent trends indicates that an upward shift in the Ethereum price signifies market recovery and serves as an indicator of broader altcoin momentum. FloppyPepe (FPPE): From Iconic Art To AI Token King FloppyPepe (FPPE) has rapidly positioned itself as a premier AI token, garnering attention from both market aficionados and crypto newbies alike. Conceived by the genius mind of Matt Furie, the creator of Pepe the Frog, whose cultural imprint spans far beyond his original canvas, FloppyPepe (FPPE) not only cements his legacy as a visionary in the crypto space but also redefines the capabilities of an AI token in the digital asset arena. The token‚Äôs robust security is reinforced by its smart contract, which blockchain security expert SolidProof rigorously audited. This diligence has fortified FloppyPepe‚Äôs (FPPE) position as one of the most reliable AI tokens available today. Further bolstering its appeal, FloppyPepe (FPPE) is collaborating with a top-leading artist to produce regular, hand-drawn pieces of FloppyPepe (FPPE) art, a creative endeavor. This creative endeavor, visual identity, and cultural cachet. At the core of FloppyPepe‚Äôs (FPPE) design is a deflationary tokenomics model. Each transaction involving this AI token burns 1% of tokens to increase scarcity while redistributing 3% to the community. This mechanism rewards long-term holders and contributes to a gradual reduction in the circulating supply, which could drive up the token‚Äôs value over time. Complementing this, the ecosystem introduces FloppyX , a cutting-edge AI agent that generates videos through text interactions, delivering consistent characters and incorporating real-time polls, feedback, and sentiment analysis. Alongside FloppyX is Meme-o-Matic , an AI agent designed to generate witty memes from submitted texts, video clips, and images, further amplifying community engagement. The newly integrated FloppyAI within this AI token also handles diverse inputs ranging from user queries to real-time market data. By applying advanced techniques such as natural language processing, pattern recognition, and predictive modeling, the system generates outputs in textual and visual formats while executing automated operational actions within the FloppyPepe (FPPE) ecosystem. This continuous feedback loop refines the AI token‚Äôs responses and adapts to shifting market dynamics. Recent developments include an AI video agent that produces high-quality videos and an AI text-to-image agent that was recently introduced to the Telegram community. Both are designed to expand the token‚Äôs utility and broaden its appeal. Notably, the ongoing presale for this AI token is attractively priced at $0.0000002 . The private round sold out within 24 hours and raised $907,200 . Act Now: Join The Presale For A Historic Crypto Leap With the rise of the Ethereum price, the ascent of a formidable AI token creates a market scenario that is truly beneficial for crypto enthusiasts who want to cash in and become wealthy. As the rising Ethereum price continues to fuel market optimism, and the unique features behind FloppyPepe (FPPE) are setting the stage for a paradigm shift in the digital asset realm. Early momentum is unmistakable. The private round of this AI token sold out within 24 hours to raise $907,200, a clear signal of the market‚Äôs confidence in its ability to transform lives and create unimaginable wealth.

This urgent development, first reported by Cointelegraph, signals a significant escalation in the global crackdown on illicit activities within the digital asset space. But who exactly is Aleksej Be≈°ciokov, and what does this Garantex founder arrest mean for the future of crypto exchanges? Who is Aleksej Be≈°ciokov and What is Garantex? Before diving into the specifics of the arrest, it‚Äôs crucial to understand who Aleksej Be≈°ciokov is and the nature of Garantex. Garantex is a cryptocurrency exchange that has come under intense scrutiny, particularly from the United States, due to concerns about its role in facilitating illicit financial flows. Here‚Äôs a quick rundown: Aleksej Be≈°ciokov: The founder of Garantex, now in the custody of Indian authorities. He is facing serious charges in the U.S., painting a picture of a key figure in the controversial world of crypto exchanges. Garantex: A Russian cryptocurrency exchange sanctioned by the U.S. Department of the Treasury‚Äôs Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC). The exchange has been flagged for allegedly enabling money laundering and facilitating transactions for illicit actors. The U.S. authorities have been keeping a close watch on Garantex, and Be≈°ciokov‚Äôs arrest underscores the international reach of law enforcement in targeting individuals associated with exchanges deemed to be operating outside the bounds of regulatory compliance. Unpacking the Money Laundering Charges: Why Was Be≈°ciokov Arrested? The arrest isn‚Äôt just about regulatory breaches; it‚Äôs about serious criminal allegations. Aleksej Be≈°ciokov is facing significant charges in the United States, including: Conspiracy to Launder Money: This is a grave charge indicating that Be≈°ciokov is accused of being involved in schemes to conceal the origins of illegally obtained funds, using Garantex as a conduit. Conspiracy to Operate an Unlicensed Money Transmitter: This charge suggests that Garantex allegedly functioned as a money transmitting business without the necessary licenses and in violation of U.S. laws. These money laundering charges highlight the severity of the situation. The U.S. sees these actions as a threat to financial integrity and national security. The accusations paint a picture of Garantex as more than just a platform for trading crypto; it‚Äôs portrayed as a potential tool for criminal activities. The extradition request from the U.S. further emphasizes the seriousness with which American authorities are treating this case. India‚Äôs Role and the Extradition Process: What Happens Next? India‚Äôs involvement in this arrest is pivotal. Be≈°ciokov was apprehended by the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI), India‚Äôs premier investigative agency. This signifies international cooperation in tackling crypto-related crime. But what does this mean for Be≈°ciokov and the extradition process? Arrest in India: Be≈°ciokov‚Äôs arrest in India demonstrates the global reach of international law enforcement and the willingness of nations to collaborate on such cases. Extradition to the U.S.: He is expected to be extradited to the United States in accordance with India‚Äôs Extradition Act. This legal process could involve hearings and appeals, but the initial signs point towards cooperation between India and the U.S. Legal Framework: India‚Äôs Extradition Act provides the legal basis for sending individuals accused of crimes in other countries back to face justice. This case will test and highlight the effectiveness of this framework in the context of cryptocurrency-related offenses. The India extradition process is now set to begin, and it will be closely watched by the crypto community and legal experts alike. It underscores the increasing legal ramifications for individuals operating in the crypto space, regardless of their geographical location. Is This Part of a Broader Crypto Exchange Crackdown? Be≈°ciokov‚Äôs arrest isn‚Äôt an isolated incident. It‚Äôs happening amidst a global push for stricter regulation and enforcement within the cryptocurrency sector. Governments worldwide are becoming increasingly concerned about the potential for crypto exchanges to be used for illicit activities. Is this the start of a larger crypto exchange crackdown ? Global Regulatory Scrutiny: Regulators across the globe are tightening their grip on crypto exchanges. Concerns about money laundering, terrorist financing, and sanctions evasion are driving this increased scrutiny. Increased Enforcement Actions: We‚Äôre seeing a rise in enforcement actions against crypto platforms that are perceived to be non-compliant or facilitating illegal activities. Garantex is just one example, but many other exchanges are under the microscope. International Cooperation: The Be≈°ciokov arrest highlights the growing collaboration between international law enforcement agencies. Countries are working together to share information and coordinate actions against crypto crime. This trend suggests that the era of loosely regulated crypto exchanges might be coming to an end. Exchanges operating internationally need to be more vigilant about compliance and anti-money laundering (AML) measures. The arrest sends a clear message: there are real-world consequences for failing to adhere to global financial regulations. What Does This Arrest Mean for the Crypto Industry? The arrest of Aleksej Be≈°ciokov is more than just about one individual or one exchange. It has broader implications for the entire cryptocurrency industry. What lessons can be learned, and what impact will this have on the future of crypto? Heightened Compliance Demands: Crypto exchanges worldwide will likely face even greater pressure to enhance their compliance frameworks. This includes robust KYC (Know Your Customer) and AML procedures. Increased User Scrutiny: Users of crypto exchanges may become more cautious and discerning, opting for platforms with a proven track record of regulatory compliance and transparency. Potential for Market Consolidation: Stricter regulations and enforcement actions could lead to market consolidation, with smaller, less compliant exchanges struggling to survive, while larger, more regulated platforms gain dominance. Focus on Decentralization vs. Regulation: This situation reignites the ongoing debate about decentralization in crypto versus the need for regulation. Finding the right balance remains a critical challenge for the industry. The case of Aleksej Be≈°ciokov and Garantex serves as a stark reminder that the crypto industry is not immune to traditional financial regulations and law enforcement. It underscores the necessity for crypto businesses to operate within legal frameworks and prioritize compliance to avoid severe repercussions. Conclusion: A Watershed Moment for Crypto Regulation The arrest of Garantex founder Aleksej Be≈°ciokov in India marks a significant moment in the ongoing evolution of cryptocurrency regulation. It demonstrates the increasing global cooperation in tackling crypto-related crime and sends a clear message to exchanges operating in the grey areas of compliance. As the extradition process unfolds and more details emerge, the crypto industry will be closely watching, understanding that this case could set precedents for future enforcement actions. The era of unchecked crypto operations is swiftly closing, paving the way for a more regulated and, hopefully, more secure digital asset ecosystem.

Changing enforcement approaches are emerging within the US crypto sector. Ripple‚Äôs legal strategy reflects a broader industry adjustment in oversight. The resolution may shape how future digital asset disputes are handled. The United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has moved closer to ending its prolonged legal battle against Ripple, according to Fox Business reporter Eleanor Terrett in a March 12 X post. Ripple, SEC Allegedly Nearing Agreement According to Terrett‚Äôs post on Wednesday, two sources familiar with the matter claim the SEC is considering ending its legal dispute with Ripple once final terms are agreed upon. SCOOP: Two well-placed sources tell me that the @SECGov vs. @Ripple case is in the process of wrapping up and could be over soon. My understanding is that the delay in reaching an agreement is due to Ripple's legal team negotiating more favorable terms regarding the August‚Ä¶ ‚Äî Eleanor Terrett (@EleanorTerrett) March 12, 2025 Negotiations have reportedly stalled due to Ripple‚Äôs legal team seeking a more favorable outcome concerning a July 2023 ruling by District Court Judge Analisa Torres , which required the company to pay a $125 million fine. The ruling was viewed as a partial win for Ripple, as the imposed fine was substantially lower than the nearly $2 billion originally sought by the SEC. In October 2024, the SEC appealed Torres‚Äô ruling, a move Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse criticized for damaging the regulator‚Äôs credibility and reputation. If Gensler and the SEC were rational, they would have moved on from this case long ago. It certainly hasn‚Äôt protected investors and instead has damaged the credibility and reputation of the SEC.

Crypto Sector Sees Regulatory Changes In The U.S. News of the potential deal comes amid broader regulatory shifts in the SEC‚Äôs approach to the blockchain industry following the resignation of former chair Gary Gensler. During Gensler‚Äôs tenure, the agency pursued multiple lawsuits against major crypto firms, including Kraken, Coinbase, and Consensys. Recently, the SEC has dropped several digital asset-related lawsuits, though cases against major firms like Coinbase and Robinhood remain ongoing. Former U.S. President Donald Trump has voiced support for cryptocurrency regulations but has received mixed reactions from the crypto community regarding his stance. If the SEC settles with Ripple, the company would be among a growing list of crypto firms no longer facing regulatory penalties. Ripple‚Äôs Fate and the Bigger Picture A resolution to the SEC‚Äôs case against Ripple would be a victory for the company, but the broader fight over crypto regulation remains far from settled. While some firms have seen enforcement actions dropped, others continue to face legal challenges, highlighting the fragmented approach that has left the industry in limbo. A shift away from aggressive lawsuits may signal a more measured strategy, but without a defined regulatory framework, digital asset firms remain in a state of uncertainty. The question now is whether policymakers will seize the moment to provide clarity or leave the industry guessing once again. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) How might a resolution in the SEC-Ripple case influence US crypto regulations? Resolving this legal dispute may prompt regulators to recalibrate their enforcement strategies, fostering a clearer framework for digital asset operations. Such a shift might influence oversight in similar future cases. What could this settlement mean for Ripple‚Äôs market outlook? A resolution might boost investor confidence and refine market perceptions about Ripple‚Äôs operational stance. This could also encourage a steadier regulatory environment for other digital asset ventures. How does this development affect future crypto legal challenges? This outcome may set a precedent, prompting clearer legal interpretations in crypto disputes. A defined resolution could reshape judicial reviews and strategies for regulators and digital asset firms in future challenges.

41560527,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=139600,1741821041,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Altcoin ETF Approval Halted: Uncertainty Grips Crypto Market as SEC Chairman Wait Continues,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/altcoin-etf-approval-halted/,"Excitement around Altcoin ETFs has hit a snag, leaving investors in suspense. The much-anticipated approval of exchange-traded funds (ETFs) for cryptocurrencies beyond Bitcoin and Ethereum is now facing significant delays. Why? The crypto community is pointing towards the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and the ongoing wait for a new chairman. Let‚Äôs dive into what this means for the future of Altcoin ETF and the broader crypto market. Why is the SEC Chairman Appointment Crucial for ETF Approval? The leadership at the SEC plays a pivotal role in shaping regulatory decisions, especially concerning innovative financial products like cryptocurrency ETFs. Currently, the SEC is awaiting the confirmation of a new chairman nominated by former U.S. President Donald Trump, Paul Atkins. Until this appointment is finalized and the new chairman takes office, major policy decisions, including the green light for ETF Approval for altcoins, are likely to remain in limbo. Here‚Äôs why the chairman‚Äôs role is so critical: Policy Direction: The chairman sets the overall agenda and regulatory tone for the SEC. A chairman with a more favorable or understanding stance towards crypto could expedite the review and approval process for crypto-related investment products. Decision-Making Authority: While decisions are often made collectively by the commissioners, the chairman‚Äôs influence is substantial. They can steer discussions, prioritize agendas, and influence the direction of investigations and approvals. Regulatory Clarity: A new chairman can bring fresh perspectives and potentially push for clearer regulatory frameworks for digital assets. This clarity is essential for the SEC to confidently approve complex financial instruments like Cryptocurrency ETF s. Altcoin ETF Approval: What‚Äôs the Current Status? Recent developments indicate a continued cautious approach from the SEC towards expanding crypto investment options. According to a CoinDesk report, the SEC has recently extended the review deadlines for several spot Altcoin ETF applications. These include ETFs focused on popular cryptocurrencies like: XRP (XRP ETF) Solana (SOL ETF) Dogecoin (DOGE ETF) Litecoin (LTC ETF) This extension of deadlines suggests that the SEC is not yet ready to give the nod to these products. The reasons for delay are multifaceted and likely include ongoing concerns about market manipulation, investor protection, and the overall maturity of the altcoin market. Paul Atkins: Potential New SEC Chairman ‚Äì What Does It Mean for Crypto? The nomination of Paul Atkins as the potential new SEC Chairman has sparked discussions within the crypto community. Atkins, a former SEC commissioner himself, is known for his pro-market stance and has previously expressed concerns about over-regulation. His potential appointment could signal a shift in the SEC‚Äôs approach to digital assets. However, it‚Äôs important to note: Nomination vs. Confirmation: While nominated by former President Trump, Atkins still needs to undergo a confirmation hearing. The date for this hearing remains unset, introducing further uncertainty. Potential Policy Shift: If confirmed, Atkins could bring a more industry-friendly perspective to the SEC. This might lead to a more streamlined process for reviewing and potentially approving Cryptocurrency ETF s, including those for altcoins. No Guarantees: Even with a potentially favorable chairman, the approval of Altcoin ETF s is not guaranteed. The SEC will still need to address its concerns regarding market risks and ensure investor protection. The Ripple Effect: Impact of Delayed ETF Approval on the Crypto Market The delay in ETF Approval for altcoins has several implications for the cryptocurrency market: Investor Sentiment: The prolonged wait can dampen investor enthusiasm, especially among institutional investors who are keen to access crypto markets through regulated and familiar investment vehicles like ETFs. Market Access: ETFs provide broader market access, particularly for retail investors who may find it challenging to directly hold and manage cryptocurrencies. Delays restrict this access and potentially slow down mainstream adoption. Price Volatility: Uncertainty surrounding regulatory approvals can contribute to price volatility in the altcoin market. Positive news about potential ETF approvals often leads to price surges, while delays can trigger dips. Competitive Landscape: Other regions, like Europe and Canada, have already approved Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs. The US lagging behind in Cryptocurrency ETF approvals could impact its competitive position in the global crypto landscape. Navigating the Uncertainty: What Can Crypto Investors Do? In the face of this regulatory uncertainty, what steps can crypto investors take? Stay Informed: Keep abreast of regulatory developments, SEC announcements, and news regarding the chairman appointment. Reliable sources like CoinDesk and other reputable crypto news outlets are crucial. Diversify Investments: Diversification remains a key strategy in volatile markets. Don‚Äôt put all your eggs in one basket, especially when it comes to speculative assets like altcoins. Long-Term Perspective: Regulatory processes can be lengthy. Maintain a long-term investment perspective and avoid making impulsive decisions based on short-term news cycles. Engage with the Community: Participate in discussions and forums to understand the broader market sentiment and share insights with fellow investors. Conclusion: The Waiting Game for Altcoin ETFs Continues The path to Altcoin ETF approval in the US remains uncertain, largely dependent on the appointment and approach of the new SEC chairman. While the nomination of Paul Atkins offers a glimmer of hope for a potentially more crypto-friendly regulatory environment, the confirmation process and subsequent policy shifts are not guaranteed. For now, the crypto market must continue to navigate this period of regulatory ambiguity, with investors closely watching for any signals that might indicate a change in direction from the SEC. The dream of easily accessible and regulated Cryptocurrency ETF s for a wider range of digital assets is still alive, but patience remains the name of the game.

Despite a surprise softening of US consumer price inflation that gives the Fed room to ease rates later in 2025, per data released on Wednesday, has failed to substantially lift the Ethereum price, which continues to languish well below $2,000. That‚Äôs despite a solid recovery from lows of other major cryptos like Bitcoin , XRP and BNB . Indeed, the ETH/BTC ration just hit its lowest level in nearly 5 years under 0.023. Ethereum‚Äôs accelerating downwards spiral versus Bitcoin is of major concern to its investors. At this rate, a retest of its 2019 lows around 0.016 could come imminently. And with the Ethereum price chart sending strong bearish signals, more downside is very likely. Here‚Äôs Where the Ethereum Price is Headed Next The Ethereum price has seen a break below, then rejection of the key long-term $2,140 resistance level in recent days. That sends a strong bearish signal that the 2024- early 2024 $2,000-$4,000 range is a thing of the past, and that Ethereum is likely to find a new range at lower levels. Bears will be eyeing a retest of the next major support zone around $1,500. A retest of these levels seems very likely in the context of an uncertain macro backdrop. Yes, softening US inflation gives the Fed more room to signal a slightly more dovish stance in 2025. But the markets main concern will remain growing US recession risk as D.O.G.E austerity and Trump trade war uncertainty start to take their toll economic growth. Mohamed El-Erian, a Bloomberg Opinion columnist, says the chance of a US recession is now at 25%-30%. El-Erian had the probability of a recession at 10% at the beginning of the year https://t.co/uM8FjGPhCZ pic.twitter.com/aT7P39i72f ‚Äî Bloomberg TV (@BloombergTV) March 12, 2025 If recession signals keep piling up in the coming weeks, and the market isn‚Äôt sufficiently satisfied that the Fed will be there to ‚Äúsave the day‚Äù, risk appetite is likely to continue to deteriorate. And while Bitcoin could hold up well thanks to strengthening narratives around it as a safe-haven, store of wealth asset, which have been emboldened since the Trump administration announced the creation of a strategic Bitcoin reserve , Ethereum is unlikely to receive much of a bid. Fundamentals thus suggest a retest of $1,500 is looking very likely. Buy the Ethereum Dip? So if the Ethereum price is destined to collapse to lower levels, would this be a good time for investors to buy the dip. Yes, for investors willing to hold through significant near-term turbulence, buying any ETH dip would likely be a good move. Macro uncertainties will not last forever. And, at some point, US financial conditions are likely to to substantially ease, meaning a surge of liquidity in the market. Prior periods of strong Ethereum price performance have come at times of increased/increasing liquidity from the Fed. So a strong rebound is to be expected as the Fed juices the market. Meanwhile, over the longer term, tailwinds from the Trump administration‚Äôs pro-crypto policy stance should also aid Ethereum. Eric Trump likes Ethereum. pic.twitter.com/Bl0s1zeygF ‚Äî Altcoin Daily (@AltcoinDailyio) February 3, 2025 The Trump administration is full of ETH HODLers. And regulatory clarity will give the Ethereum ecosystem a lot of room to grow over the coming years. Traders must also remember that Ethereum remains the dominant DeFi chain, and the most trusted smart contract blockchain in crypto, hence its backing from BlackRock. As ugly as things look right now, and as much FUD as there is in the market, Ethereum‚Äôs long-term outlook remains strong. Its biggest problem into the future is likely to remain a deteriorating market share as nimbler rivals attract new users at a faster rather than Ethereum does. That said, Ethereum is still far and away the best candidate for major institutions looking to take part in DeFi, thanks to its status as the most trusted and decentralized of the smart contract blockchains. Accumulating ETH as it approaches $1,500 with a view to hold for at least a few years could be a great strategy. Investors should not rule out the possibility that ETH reaches $10,000 by the end of Trump‚Äôs four year term.

The law regulates cryptocurrency automatic teller machines (ATMs). It establishes conditions for operating crypto ATMs and provides consumer protections for ATM users. The bill passed the state‚Äôs 49-member nonpartisan, unicameral legislature on March 6 with 48 votes in favor and one legislator excused from voting. Governor Jim Pillen signed the bill on March 11. The act makes ATM operators liable for some fraud Under the new law , crypto ATM operators must have a money transmitter license. They are required to make their fees known in advance and post clear warnings about potential scams and other risks associated with cryptocurrency. New customers will be limited to $2,000 a day in transactions, and established customers will be allowed $10,500 a day. Operators will also have to have a refund policy for customers who report fraud within 30 days. New customers are eligible for a full refund on funds lost to fraud while existing customers would get fees returned. Operators will be required to have a full-time compliance officer and an anti-fraud policy backed up by the use of blockchain analytics software. They will provide live customer service on weekdays from 7:00 a.m. to 9:00 p.m. and a ‚Äúdedicated communication method‚Äù with law enforcement. The governor spun the new law as support for the crypto industry. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôve been working hard to build Nebraska into a cryptocurrency leader. An important part of these efforts is to make sure that we have guardrails to prevent criminals from taking advantage of Nebraskans,‚Äù Pillen said in a statement announcing the bill‚Äôs signing. According to the American Association of Retired Persons (AARP), Nebraskans reported 239 scams with cryptocurrency in 2023. They lost a cumulative $14.6 million in those scams. Real losses were probably much higher but unreported, the AARP added. Nebraska has passed several acts affecting crypto The bill was introduced by Eliot Bostar in January. The law will go into effect three months after the legislature adjourns for Spring. According to Bitcoinlaws.io, there is no other Bitcoin-related legislation¬†currently being considered in the state. There is, however, a bill introduced at the request of the governor that would¬†impose¬†a 2.5-cent per kWh excise tax on cryptocurrency mining operations consuming over 1,000 kWh annually and allow public power districts to require financial assurances from these operations, among other things. That bill is currently in hearings. Bostar introduced the Adopt the Blockchain Basics Act, which would have regulated cryptocurrency mining, custody, and trading, in 2023. That bill was carried over into 2024, but its¬†status¬†since April has been ‚Äúindefinitely postponed.‚Äù Nebraska hosts Telcoin Bank, an issuer of the eUSD stablecoin. Telcoin was chartered as the state‚Äôs first Digital Asset Depository Institution in February, after applying in December. Telcoin founder and CEO Paul Neuner said, ‚ÄúThe Nebraska charter creates an actual bank charter and the first that is explicitly authorized to connect consumers to DeFi [decentralized finance].‚Äù The concept of Digital Asset Depository Institution was introduced in the Nebraska Financial Innovation Act of 2021. That law established a regulatory framework for digital asset depositories and allowed existing state-chartered banks to operate digital asset divisions. It also brought state legislation in line with the Uniform Commercial Code. Nebraska was also one of the 18 states that sued the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and its then-chair Gary Gensler in November, alleging the agency and its head had shown ‚Äúgross government overreach.‚Äù Cryptopolitan Academy: Tired of market swings?

Among the notable players are Qubetics, Bittensor TAO, and Bitcoin Cash, all of which have demonstrated significant potential for exponential returns. With the market‚Äôs volatility and fluctuating sentiment, these cryptocurrencies stand out for their resilience, innovation, and underlying technologies. For those looking for high-reward opportunities, these cryptos have captured the attention of the broader community. Bitcoin Cash (BCH) is proving its strength, managing to hold steady above critical support levels while offering participants a glimpse of growth potential. Meanwhile, Bittensor TAO is showing promising signs of recovery, poised to break key resistance levels with the backing of Bitcoin‚Äôs recent rally. As market conditions shift in favor of bullish movements, these two projects offer a solid foundation for those seeking best cryptos for exponential returns. Now, a new contender has entered the stage: Qubetics. Unlike its predecessors, Qubetics is focused on solving real-world problems that have plagued the blockchain and digital finance sectors. With its Real World Asset Tokenisation Marketplace, Qubetics aims to provide businesses, professionals, and individuals with the tools they need to navigate the ever-evolving world of digital assets. Qubetics: A New Era in Blockchain and Digital Finance Qubetics is making waves with its innovative approach to tokenizing real-world assets. The Real World Asset Tokenisation Marketplace aims to bridge the gap between traditional assets and the digital world. By allowing businesses and individuals to tokenize physical and digital assets, Qubetics will facilitate faster, more secure, and more transparent transactions. This platform is set to revolutionize how assets are traded and exchanged. For professionals and businesses, the ability to tokenize real-world assets provides opportunities to unlock liquidity, reduce barriers to entry, and create a more dynamic market for assets that were previously illiquid. Participants in the Qubetics presale have already witnessed significant momentum, with the $TICS token currently priced at $0.1074. As the presale progresses, experts predict substantial returns, with potential for 830% to 9,206% ROI after the mainnet launch, making Qubetics a prime candidate for those seeking best cryptos for exponential returns. The crypto presale is currently in its 25th stage, having sold over 499 million tokens to more than 22,900 holders. As the project continues to build momentum, early adopters are positioning themselves for significant gains. With a projected $TICS price increase to $1 after the presale, and potential for $5 to $15 following the mainnet launch, the community is buzzing with excitement over Qubetics‚Äô potential to solve long-standing issues in the blockchain space as one of the best cryptos for exponential returns. Bittensor TAO: A Rising Star in Blockchain Bittensor (TAO) is making a comeback after a rough period, and its prospects are looking bright. Following a 30% decline, TAO has rebounded by 13.93% in the last 24 hours, signaling strong upward momentum. Analysts are closely watching as TAO is testing a falling wedge breakout, a historically bullish pattern that could propel the price toward a $400 target. The recent market recovery, led by Bitcoin, has provided TAO with the support it needs to push toward new highs. TAO‚Äôs technical analysis suggests that if it can clear key resistance levels, it could potentially reach its target price of $400, offering participants a solid opportunity for exponential returns. The market‚Äôs current bullish sentiment is favoring altcoins like TAO, making it an ideal time for those looking to capitalize on the recovery. TAO‚Äôs blockchain network is particularly attractive due to its focus on artificial intelligence (AI), offering decentralized machine learning models. This innovative technology is drawing attention from the crypto community, with expectations that it will drive future growth and adoption. For those seeking exposure to the AI sector through blockchain, TAO provides an enticing entry point. Bitcoin Cash (BCH): Resilience Amidst Volatility Bitcoin Cash (BCH) has demonstrated resilience during periods of market turbulence, managing to stabilize above the $345 support level after a 5% drop. Despite the broader market downturn, BCH has shown more strength compared to Bitcoin, which posted losses of over 8%. BCH‚Äôs ability to hold key support levels is a positive sign for backers looking for stability in a volatile market. However, the derivatives markets reveal some downside risks. BCH could face significant sell-offs if the price falls below the $339 level, as many bear traders have already placed short positions, potentially triggering liquidations. Yet, BCH has shown that it can recover from such pullbacks, making it an attractive option for those looking for a more stable crypto asset that has the potential for exponential returns if it regains upward momentum. With increasing network activity and the potential for positive catalysts in the market, Bitcoin Cash remains a strong contender for those interested in capturing long-term gains. While the risk of downside exists, BCH‚Äôs robust infrastructure and backing by a loyal community position it as a resilient cryptocurrency in times of market uncertainty. Final Thoughts As the crypto market continues to evolve, community members and participants are presented with unique opportunities to generate exponential returns. Qubetics, Bittensor TAO, and Bitcoin Cash are all showing significant potential for growth, each offering a unique value proposition. Whether it‚Äôs Qubetics‚Äô innovative approach to tokenizing real-world assets, TAO‚Äôs cutting-edge AI-driven blockchain, or BCH‚Äôs resilience in the face of volatility, these cryptos are primed for exponential growth. Qubetics, in particular, is set to be a game-changer in the blockchain and digital finance sectors. Its Real World Asset Tokenisation Marketplace addresses the pressing need for liquidity and accessibility in the asset market, making it an exciting project for future gains. As the presale continues to gather momentum, those seeking best cryptos for exponential returns should keep an eye on Qubetics and its groundbreaking solutions.

On the technicals, Solana is inching toward a death cross for the third time in its history. Alameda Unstakes 177,000 SOL Amid Distribution Spree According to an Arkham post , an Alameda Research-associated address has unstaked $23 million SOL, distributing the funds to several addresses. On-chain data indicates that the Alameda staking address received $22.9 million SOL following a staking address unlock. Upon receipt of the tokens, the funds were distributed to 37 addresses associated with FTX and Alameda. Cumulatively, the 37 recipient addresses hold $178.82 million SOL, sparking fears of a selloff. Typically, unstaking large amounts of SOL triggers selling pressure for Solana price. In the event of a sale, excess SOL floods the market and if demands fall to match supply, prices take a massive hit. A move to exchanges will confirm speculation of a selloff with similar moves historically triggering corrections for Solana price. At the start of March, Solana whales unstaked nearly $1 billion SOL as prices tumbled to multiple-month lows. Solana Price Marches Toward Death Cross Onchain indicators say Solana is approaching a death cross for the third time in its history. The death cross is a bearish signal, occurring when the 50-day moving average crosses below the 200-day moving average. Achieving a death cross could send Solana price to new lows with previous occurrences proving extremely bearish. The first death cross in 2022 saw prices fall by over 90%, exacerbated by FTX‚Äôs implosion. The second death cross in 2022 saw prices take a nose dive before staging a recovery during the ‚ÄúTrump pump.‚Äù Experts say projections for SOL to reach $200 are unlikely as it trades at a six-month low. At the moment, Solana price is trading at $126.53 down by nearly 15% over the last week. For now, traders are proceeding with caution with the biggest indicator being a steep drop in daily trading volume. Over the last 24 hours, trading volume has fallen by 22.71% to settle at $4.1 billion.

OKX Europe is making significant strides in the regulated digital asset space. The exchange has strategically acquired a MiFID II-licensed firm in Malta, signaling a bold move towards offering regulated crypto derivatives to its European users. This development underscores OKX‚Äôs commitment to compliance and expansion within the European market, but what does this mean for the future of crypto trading in the region? Let‚Äôs dive into the details. OKX Europe‚Äôs Strategic Acquisition: A Game Changer? OKX Europe‚Äôs recent acquisition of a MiFID II-licensed firm in Malta is more than just a business deal; it‚Äôs a strategic maneuver designed to solidify its position in the European cryptocurrency market. This move is specifically aimed at enabling OKX to offer regulated crypto derivatives to its European customer base. Why is this significant? Regulatory Compliance: Operating under a MiFID II license demonstrates OKX‚Äôs commitment to adhering to European regulatory standards. This is crucial for building trust and legitimacy in the eyes of both users and regulators. Expansion of Services: The acquisition paves the way for OKX Europe to broaden its service offerings beyond spot trading, venturing into the lucrative and complex world of crypto derivatives. Market Access: A MiFID II license provides a robust framework for operating within the European financial market, opening doors to a wider audience of institutional and retail investors. However, it‚Äôs important to note that while the acquisition is a major step, OKX still needs to secure final approval from the Malta Financial Services Authority (MFSA). This regulatory nod is essential before OKX can officially commence operations under the MiFID II license later this year. Decoding the MiFID II License: What Does It Mean? MiFID II, or the Markets in Financial Instruments Directive II, is a cornerstone of the European Union‚Äôs financial regulation. But what exactly does a MiFID II License entail, and why is it so valuable for a cryptocurrency exchange like OKX? Essentially, MiFID II is designed to: Increase Transparency: It aims to make financial markets more transparent by imposing stricter reporting requirements and trading rules. Enhance Investor Protection: A core objective is to protect investors by ensuring firms act in their clients‚Äô best interests and provide appropriate levels of information and safeguards. Promote Fair Competition: MiFID II seeks to foster fair and efficient markets by regulating trading venues and investment firms across the EU. For OKX Europe, holding a MiFID II license means operating under a well-established regulatory framework that is recognized and respected across Europe. This license is not just a piece of paper; it‚Äôs a testament to OKX‚Äôs commitment to operating at a high standard of regulatory compliance, which is particularly important when dealing with complex financial products like crypto derivatives . Why Malta? The Allure of a Crypto-Friendly Nation Malta has long been recognized as a progressive jurisdiction in the cryptocurrency and blockchain space. Why did OKX choose Malta for this strategic expansion? Malta offers several key advantages that make it an attractive location for crypto businesses: Pro-Innovation Regulatory Environment: Malta was one of the first EU member states to establish a comprehensive legal framework for blockchain and cryptocurrencies, earning it the moniker ‚ÄúBlockchain Island.‚Äù EU Membership: Being part of the European Union allows companies based in Malta to benefit from EU-wide market access and regulatory harmonization. Talent Pool: Malta has cultivated a growing ecosystem of professionals with expertise in blockchain, fintech, and regulatory compliance. Favorable Tax Regime: Malta offers a competitive tax system that can be advantageous for international businesses. By acquiring a firm in Malta, OKX Europe is strategically positioning itself within a jurisdiction that is both crypto-friendly and compliant with European standards. This move leverages Malta‚Äôs supportive environment to facilitate its expansion into regulated crypto derivatives offerings. The Future of Crypto Derivatives in Europe: What to Expect? OKX Europe‚Äôs move comes at a pivotal time for the European cryptocurrency market. With the upcoming Markets in Crypto Assets (MiCA) regulation, the landscape is rapidly evolving. How will this acquisition and the focus on regulatory approval impact the availability and accessibility of crypto derivatives in Europe? Here‚Äôs what we can anticipate: Aspect Potential Impact Increased Regulatory Clarity MiCA and national licenses like MiFID II will provide clearer guidelines for crypto firms, fostering a more stable and predictable operating environment. Enhanced Investor Confidence Regulation can boost investor confidence by providing a level of protection and oversight that is currently lacking in many parts of the crypto market. Growth of Institutional Participation Regulatory frameworks can encourage institutional investors to enter the crypto derivatives market, bringing in greater liquidity and maturity. Product Innovation As regulatory clarity increases, we may see more innovative and sophisticated crypto derivative products tailored to the European market. However, challenges remain. Navigating the complex web of European and national regulations, ensuring compliance, and educating users about the risks and complexities of crypto derivatives will be ongoing tasks for OKX and other players in the space. Navigating Regulatory Hurdles: The Path to Approval While the acquisition of a MiFID II-licensed firm is a significant achievement, the journey isn‚Äôt over yet for OKX Europe. Securing regulatory approval from the MFSA is the next crucial step. What does this process typically involve, and what are the potential hurdles? The MFSA approval process will likely involve: Due Diligence: The MFSA will conduct thorough due diligence on OKX Europe, assessing its financial stability, operational capabilities, and compliance frameworks. Compliance Checks: Rigorous checks will be carried out to ensure OKX‚Äôs operations align with MiFID II requirements and Maltese regulations. Risk Management Assessment: The MFSA will evaluate OKX‚Äôs risk management systems and controls, particularly in relation to the offering of crypto derivatives. Ongoing Supervision: Even after approval, OKX will be subject to ongoing supervision by the MFSA to ensure continued compliance. The successful completion of this regulatory approval process is paramount for OKX to realize its ambitions of offering regulated crypto derivatives in Europe. The industry will be watching closely to see how this progresses, as it could set a precedent for other exchanges seeking to expand their regulated offerings in the region. Conclusion: A Strategic Win for OKX and European Crypto? OKX Europe‚Äôs acquisition of a MiFID II-licensed firm in Malta is undoubtedly a strategic win for the exchange, positioning it favorably to tap into the growing European market for regulated crypto derivatives . This move, coupled with its earlier MiCA registration, signals a clear commitment to operating within the bounds of European regulation and providing a compliant platform for its users. While final regulatory approval is still pending, this development represents a significant step forward for OKX Europe and potentially for the broader adoption of regulated crypto derivatives in Europe. As the regulatory landscape continues to evolve, OKX‚Äôs proactive approach could pave the way for a more mature and accessible crypto market in the region.

The Bolivian media outlet Urgente reported that President Luis Arce‚Äôs cabinet has also given YPFB the go-ahead to purchase US dollars from domestic financial institutions, including the state-run bank Banco Uni√≥n. Bolivia: Crypto Move The Cabinet noted that YPFB was free to use USD or crypto to conduct fuel import-related deals with overseas vendors. YPFB engineers at a facility in Bolivia. (Source: YPFB/Facebook) The government issued a special decree permitting the firm to use crypto and USD specifically to buy ‚Äúcrude oil and diesel.‚Äù The firm can also use crypto to buy related products that can be used to refine gasoline. Arce‚Äôs crisis-hit government has been locked in a standoff with Bolivia‚Äôs Former President Evo Morales since last year. Clashes between groups loyal to Arce and those who support Morales have led to armed takeovers of military posts and road blockades. Arce‚Äôs government has also been best with problems in the Bolivian parliament, the Plurinational Legislative Assembly. La Paz says this has ‚Äúimpeded the entry of foreign currency‚Äù by ‚Äúblocking the approval of loans totaling over $1.667 billion.‚Äù This has left YPFB short of the foreign currency it needs to pay for fuel imports. In turn, this has led to a drop in supplies of both diesel and gasoline.

Experts think countries fighting sanctions regimes are now turning to crypto as a payments tool. The government of Iran approved the use of crypto for imports in 2022, with some in Moscow calling Tehran a ‚Äúpioneer‚Äù in crypto-powered trade. Venezuela has also used crypto in fossil fuel trade deals. This, at one stage, led to the Nicol√°s Maduro-led government reportedly amassing a huge ‚Äústash‚Äù of Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) coins.

Many believe that Russian oil firms have made extensive use of crypto. Moscow has also openly spoken about using crypto to bypass US, EU, and UK sanctions for both imports and exports. Last year, the Bolivian lawmaker Mariela Baldivieso said farmers in the country could soon start using crypto as a remittance tool .

Coinbase, one of the world‚Äôs leading cryptocurrency exchanges, has just dropped a bombshell announcement. Buckle up, because they‚Äôre listing Aethir (ATH)! This news, revealed on X, has sent ripples of excitement throughout the crypto community. Mark your calendars for March 13th at 9:00 a.m. (PT) ‚Äì that‚Äôs when the Coinbase listing ATH goes live. But what exactly is Aethir, and why is this listing such a big deal? Let‚Äôs dive into the details. What is Aethir and the Buzz Around ATH? Aethir is not just another cryptocurrency project; it‚Äôs a platform focused on something truly groundbreaking: decentralized GPU usage. In a world increasingly reliant on processing power for everything from AI to gaming, Aethir is stepping in to democratize access to GPUs. Imagine a future where GPU resources are readily available and distributed, rather than concentrated in the hands of a few. That‚Äôs the vision Aethir is working towards. The ATH token is the lifeblood of this ecosystem. Think of it as the fuel that powers the Aethir network. It serves as the primary medium of exchange within the Aethir ecosystem, facilitating transactions and incentivizing participation. As the platform grows, the utility of the ATH token is expected to increase, making this Coinbase listing ATH announcement even more significant. Why is the Coinbase Listing ATH a Game Changer? Coinbase listing ATH is more than just adding another token to a crypto exchange. It‚Äôs a validation and a massive leap forward for Aethir and the concept of decentralized GPUs. Here‚Äôs why this listing is generating so much excitement: Increased Visibility and Accessibility: Coinbase is a giant in the crypto world, known for its user-friendly platform and broad reach. Listing ATH on Coinbase instantly exposes Aethir to millions of potential users and investors who may not have been aware of the project before. This increased visibility is crucial for adoption and growth. Enhanced Liquidity: A listing on a major exchange like Coinbase typically leads to a significant boost in liquidity. This means it will be easier to buy and sell ATH tokens, making it more attractive for traders and investors. Higher liquidity can also contribute to price stability and reduce volatility. Credibility and Trust: Coinbase has a rigorous vetting process for listing new tokens. Their decision to list ATH signals a level of confidence in the project‚Äôs legitimacy, technology, and potential. This endorsement can significantly enhance Aethir‚Äôs credibility within the often skeptical crypto space. Mainstream Adoption of Decentralized GPUs: By listing ATH, Coinbase is indirectly promoting the concept of decentralized GPUs to a mainstream audience. This can accelerate the adoption of this innovative technology and pave the way for a more distributed and accessible computing future. Decentralized GPUs: Unlocking the Power of Distributed Computing The concept of decentralized GPUs might sound technical, but its implications are far-reaching. Here‚Äôs a simplified look at why decentralized GPUs are so important: Democratizing Access to Computing Power: Currently, access to high-performance GPUs is often limited and expensive. Decentralized GPU networks aim to break down these barriers, making powerful computing resources available to anyone, anywhere.

Security researchers have discovered over the last few months that the group has been sabotaging malicious npm packages that steal credentials, exfiltrate cryptocurrency wallet data, and create a persistent backdoor in development environments. It marks a major escalation in their years-long cyberwar, which has already witnessed some of the biggest crypto heists in history. According to a new investigation by the Socket Research Team , a branch of Lazarus Group has penetrated the npm repository, one of the most popular package managers for JavaScript developers. The hackers then used typosquatting techniques to publish malicious versions of popular npm packages, deceiving unsuspecting developers into downloading the programs. The packages include is-buffer-validator, yoojae-validator, event-handle-package, array-empty-validator, react-event-dependency, and auth-validator. When executed, the compromised packages install BeaverTail malware. This ‚Äúadvanced‚Äù tool can steal login credentials, search through browser files for saved passwords and dump files from cryptocurrency wallets, such as Solana and Exodus. Security researchers noted that the stolen data were sent to the hardcoded command-and-control (C2) server, a common modus operandi employed by the Lazarus Group to relay confidential data back to their actors. Its purpose is to steal and transmit compromised data without being detected, and it was particularly threatening in the world of developers building financial and blockchain applications, says Kirill Boychenko, a threat intelligence analyst at Socket Security. Lazarus launched an offensive against Bybit, stealing nearly $1.46 billion In addition to these supply chain attacks, Lazarus Group has also been tied to one of the biggest cryptocurrency thefts on record. Its first action is suspected to have occurred on February 21, 2025, when group-linked hackers breached Bybit, one of the world‚Äôs biggest crypto exchanges, making off with an estimated $1.46 billion in crypto assets. The attack was extremely sophisticated and was allegedly launched from a compromised device of a Safe{Wallet} employee, a Bybit technology partner. Hackers leveraged a vulnerability in the infrastructure of Bybit‚Äôs Ethereum wallet and altered smart contract logic to redirect funds to their wallets. Although Bybit addressed the problem immediately, a statement from CEO Ben Zhou revealed that 20% of the stolen money had already been laundered via mixing services and was untraceable. This latest series of attacks is part of North Korea‚Äôs broader effort to evade international sanctions against it by stealing and laundering cryptocurrency. According to a 2024 United Nations report, North Korean cybercriminals were responsible for over 35% of global cryptocurrency thefts over the past year, accumulating over $1 billion in stolen assets. Lazarus Group is not just a cybercrime syndicate but also a geopolitics threat since stolen money is reportedly directly funnelled into the nation‚Äôs nuclear weapons and ballistic missile programs. Such Lazarus Group attacks have also progressed over the years, from direct exchange hacks to supply chain attacks and even developer and software repository attacks. By adding backdoors to open-source platforms like npm, PyPI, and GitHub, the group expands its potential attack range to many systems, eliminating the need to hack directly into cryptocurrency exchanges. Security experts are calling for stricter protections for crypto developers Noting these growing risks, cyber specialists are pushing for stricter security for developers and crypto users and protection from hackers. One such best practice is verifying the realness of npm packages before installation because typosquatting continues to be one of the most common methods cyber criminals use. Socket AI Scanner also tracks anomalies in your software dependencies or npm audit, which informs you whether any compromised packages are in use and allows you to remove them from your application before they can do any real damage. The guide recommends that users and developers take the initiative to protect themselves by enabling multi-factor authentication (MFA) for exchange wallets, developer platforms like GitHub, and other accounts. Network monitoring is now regarded as the first line of defence as the compromised system will usually send messages back to an external command and control (C2) server, which then uploads the malicious updates on the infected computer. Blocking illegitimate outbound traffic can cut hackers‚Äô access to this stolen data. Bybit launches recovery bounty as crypto security battle heats up Following the Bybit hack, the exchange also initiated a Recovery Bounty Program, rewarding anyone who helps find the stolen assets. The program allows for rewards of up to 10% of the money recovered. At the same time, the larger crypto ecosystem is busy ramping up security practices and alerting developers to protect against the same practices that can lead down this threatening path. But as Lazarus Group‚Äôs tactics advance ever more quickly, network defenders say the war on crypto has only just begun. Cryptopolitan Academy: Tired of market swings?

41561678,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=691882,1741822557,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/41561678.jpeg,State-backed Bolivian energy firm YPFB turns to crypto amid painful dollar shortage,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/bolivian-energy-firm-ypfb-turns-to-crypto/,"The Bolivian state energy company, Yacimientos Petrol√≠feros Fiscales Bolivianos (YPFB) has announced plans to make energy imports into the country with cryptocurrency as there is a current shortage of dollars within the country. This shortage is due to the dwindling exports of natural gases over the years. Up until June 2024, Bolivia‚Äôs central bank, Banco Central de Bolivia had a ban placed on Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. At the time, the bank cited Bolivia‚Äôs struggling economy as the reason for the ban. It also stated that the ban would align the country with Latin American crypto regulations. The ban was lifted for a simpler reason ‚Äî the global acceptance of cryptocurrencies. Other Latin American countries such as El Salvador, Argentina, Brazil, and Mexico had adopted the use of cryptocurrencies before Bolivia jumped on the wagon. With its economy still struggling and the reduction in exports, the country is again turning to cryptocurrency as a way out. Cryptocurrency for energy According to Reuters , a spokesperson for the state-run energy firm YPFB revealed that a system to use cryptocurrency to purchase fuel imports has been put in place. The energy firm also said that it had received government approval to use digital assets to help meet demand. Despite the government‚Äôs approval, YPFB has not yet used digital currency to purchase energy imports, but it intends to do so, according to a government spokesperson. Bolivia is catching up to other countries within South America with its increased acceptance and adoption of cryptocurrency and digital assets. Countries such as El Salvador and Argentina are integrating digital assets into their financial systems. Argentina‚Äôs state-owned energy firm, YPF, ventured into crypto mining operations in 2022 and has been supplying power for mining activities while making plans to further expand its crypto mining operations. Brazil established a law regulating digital assets in December 2022, and it came into effect in June 2023. The aim of the regulation was to legalize crypto as a payment method. Bolivia fuel shortages Bolivia‚Äôs economy is largely dependent on its vast natural resources. The country‚Äôs primary export is natural gas, but it also exports gold, zinc, and silver among other commodities. Bolivia‚Äôs natural gas exports were valued at $2.05B in 2023 and while this might sound like an impressive amount, those figures are a whopping 31% less than the value of Bolivia‚Äôs natural gas exports from the previous year which was valued at approximately $2.97B. Following the descending trend, the value of natural gas exports from Bolivia in 2021 was also higher than that of 2022. The exports of natural gas from Bolivia are typically imported by Argentina and Brazil. Over the years, the country has been experiencing a significant decline in its exports of natural gas, and as a result, has witnessed a decrease in its foreign currency reserves. This shortage of dollars has rendered the country incapable of regular function as it uses the US dollar to import goods, fuel included. The lack of dollars led to a fuel crisis in the country, and now, long lines at gas stations and scattered protests are becoming a norm. Bolivia functioned as a net energy exporter due to its large reserves of gas. The country also utilized its natural resources domestically. However, with the diminishing production, it has become reliant on imports to meet the country‚Äôs energy consumption needs.

National regulatory bodies across the European Union deliberated on the issue during a meeting led by the European Securities and Markets Authority‚Äôs (ESMA) Digital Finance Standing Committee on March 6. OKX Faces Intense Scrutiny The focus of the inquiry is OKX‚Äôs Web3 service, which happens to be a decentralized finance (DeFi) platform and self-custodial wallet that facilitates access to multiple blockchains and exchanges. Reports indicate that hackers, allegedly tied to North Korea, funneled approximately $100 million in stolen cryptocurrency through this platform. Bloomberg report suggests that authorities are now assessing whether OKX‚Äôs Web3 service falls under the jurisdiction of the EU‚Äôs newly implemented Markets in Cryptoassets (MiCA) regulation, which aims to oversee digital asset providers and ensure compliance with financial security measures. Some regulators, particularly from Austria and Croatia, argued that OKX‚Äôs Web3 service should be subject to MiCA‚Äôs regulatory framework despite fully decentralized platforms being exempt under the rules that came into force in late 2024. A key point of discussion at the meeting was whether the platform‚Äôs integration into OKX‚Äôs main website and its connection to an OKX Singapore entity constituted grounds for enforcement under MiCA. A regulatory presentation at the meeting reportedly outlined how OKX‚Äôs user interface enables token swaps and wallet connections directly through its website, suggesting centralized oversight rather than a purely decentralized model. Additionally, officials raised concerns about potential violations of sanctions against North Korea, given the laundering activities linked to the attack. The outcome of this regulatory scrutiny could lead to penalties for the crypto and further discussions on the application of EU financial laws to similar platforms. OKX Responds OKX has firmly rejected claims, calling the Bloomberg report misleading. The exchange clarified that its Web3 wallet and swap features function similarly to those of other major crypto platforms, and serve as aggregators to improve user efficiency rather than facilitating illicit transactions. According to OKX, its immediate response to the Bybit breach included freezing related funds on its centralized exchange and introducing a new tool to detect and block hacker-linked addresses from accessing its decentralized exchange or wallet services. The company expressed disappointment over Bybit‚Äôs statements and argued that they contributed to misinformation by wrongly implying an investigation into OKX. It even went on to emphasize that regulatory scrutiny is not directed at its operations but rather stems from broader industry discussions on decentralized finance regulations. Additionally, OKX suggested that the real issue lies in Bybit‚Äôs security shortcomings, rather than any wrongdoing on its part. The exchange strongly refuted what it described as false claims that misrepresented its role in the aftermath of the cyberattack.

Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong has stated that more government institutions are showing interest in digital assets, with a growing number engaging in trading, custody, and blockchain applications. Coinbase CEO: US Bitcoin Reserve Sparks More Government Crypto Adoption In a recent post on X platform, Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong announced that the company now collaborates with 145 government entities in the United States and 29 internationally. The company provides services such as custody, trading, and blockchain infrastructure to these institutions. Cobase CEO Armstrong noted that the launch of the U.S. Strategic Bitcoin Reserve has accelerated interest from government bodies. More institutions are looking to integrate digital assets into their financial frameworks. The top crypto exchange has positioned itself as a primary partner for public-sector organizations seeking to engage with crypto securely. More so, just days ago, the exchange secured its registration with the Financial Intelligence Unit (FIU), marking a key step toward resuming operations in India . Coinbase‚Äôs return follows a period of regulatory adjustments in the country. India‚Äôs crypto market, with its growing adoption, presents an opportunity for the exchange‚Äôs expansion. Government Partnerships for Crypto Services Coinbase has built relationships with multiple government entities at the federal, state, and local levels. The company provides custody solutions, trading infrastructure, and blockchain integration services to these institutions. As a publicly traded company, Coinbase adheres to strict regulatory standards. The firm emphasizes compliance and security, which has contributed to its role as a trusted crypto partner for governments worldwide. Notably, Coinbase has safeguarded digital assets for over 13 years without experiencing a security breach. The company employs advanced encryption methods, multi-factor authentication, and physical security measures to protect digital holdings. Governments are not only interested in Bitcoin as a store of value but also in blockchain technology for operational improvements. Public institutions are exploring the use of blockchain for secure transactions, record-keeping, and financial management. Coinbase CEO revealed the Exchange offers, portfolio management, due diligence, and technical solutions to support government entities in their crypto adoption. Additionally, most recently, Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong shared that the top crypto exchange plans to accelerate its U.S. expansion by hiring 1,000 employees in 2025. This decision comes as regulatory clarity improves, allowing Coinbase to focus on growth rather than legal uncertainties.

This came as he revealed a critical technical indicator, which has turned bearish for the flagship crypto, although he noted that BTC bulls can still invalidate this current bearish setup. Bitcoin Price At Risk Of Further Crash As S&P Monthly LMACD Turns Bearish In an X post, Severino indicated that the Bitcoin price could crash further as the S&P 500 monthly LMACD has begun to cross bearish and the histogram has turned red. This development is significant as IntoTheBlock data shows that BTC and the stock market still have a strong positive price correlation. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Action Says Bottom Is In, Analyst Reveals What‚Äôs Coming The crypto analyst stated that BTC bulls can turn this bearish setup for the Bitcoin price in the next 20 days, as diverging would lead to a bullish setup instead. However, the Bulls‚Äô failure to turn this around for Bitcoin could lead to a massive decline for the flagship crypto, worse than it has already witnessed. Severino stated that a confirmation of this bearish setup at the end of the month could kick off a bear market or Black Swan type event similar to what happened when the last two crossovers occurred. It is worth mentioning that BTC has already crashed to as low as $76,000 recently, sparking concerns that the bear market might already be here. However, crypto experts such as BitMEX co-founder Arthur Hayes have suggested that the bull market is still well in play for the Bitcoin price. Hayes noted that BTC has corrected around 30% from its current all-time high (ATH), which he remarked is normal in a bull run. The BitMEX founder predicts that the flagship crypto will rebound once the US Federal Reserve begins to ease its monetary policies. BTC Still Looking Good Despite Recent Crash Crypto analyst Kevin Capital has suggested that the Bitcoin price still looks good despite the recent crash. In his latest market update, he stated that BTC remains the best-looking chart and that everything is going according to plan for the flagship crypto. The analyst predicts that Bitcoin could still come down and test the range between $70,000 and $75,000, which he claims would still be completely fine. Related Reading: Bitcoin 77% Correction To $25,000, Will History Repeat Itself Kevin Capital remarked that the Bitcoin price could remain afloat if it holds a key market structure and the 3-day MACD resets. He added that some decent macro data could help the flagship crypto stay above key support levels. The US CPI data will be released today, which could provide some relief for the market if it shows that inflation is slowing. The analyst is confident that one good inflation report and the FOMC can help turn the tides. At the time of writing, the Bitcoin price is trading at around $81,860, up over 2% in the last 24 hours, according to data from CoinMarketCap.

Data from Ethereum block explorer shows the MEV attack occurred on decentralized exchange Uniswap v3‚Äôs USDC-USDT liquidity pool, where $19.8 million worth of value is locked. Details of the sandwich attack transaction. Source: Etherscan The MEV bot front-ran the transaction by swapping all the USDC liquidity out of the Uniswap v3 USDC-USDT pool and then put it back in after the transaction was executed, according to founder of The DeFi Report Michael Nadeau. The attacker tipped Ethereum block builder ‚Äúbob-the-builder.eth‚Äù $200,000 from the $220,764 swap and profited $8,000 themselves, Nadeau said. DeFi researcher ‚ÄúDeFiac‚Äù speculates the same trader using different wallets has fallen victim to a total of six sandwich attacks, citing ‚Äúinternal tools.‚Äù They pointed out that all funds traveled from borrowing and lending protocol Aave before being deposited on Uniswap. Two of the wallets fell victim to an MEV bot sandwich attack on March 12 at around 9:00 am UTC.

Both transactors made the same swap in the Uniswap v3 liquidity pool as the trader who made the $220,762 transfer. Others speculate the trades could be attempts at money laundering . ‚ÄúIf you have NK illicit funds you could construct a very mev-able tx, then privately send it to a mev bot and have them arb it in a bundle,‚Äù said founder of crypto data dashboard DefiLlama, 0xngmi. ‚ÄúThat way you wash all the money with close to 0 losses.‚Äù Related: THORChain at crossroads: Decentralization clashes with illicit activity While initially criticizing Uniswap, Nadeau later acknowledged that the transactions didn‚Äôt come from Uniswap's front end, which has MEV protection and default slippage settings.

The Nasdaq Composite jumped by 1.2%, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell by 0.2%, extending its own three-day slide, according to data from CNBC. Futures for major indexes ticked up after the closing bell. S&P 500 futures rose 0.2%, Nasdaq 100 futures climbed by 0.2%, and Dow futures added 45 points, or 0.1%. In extended trading, Intel surged 10% after appointing Lip-Bu Tan as its new CEO, while Adobe dropped 4% after projecting weaker-than-expected earnings for its second fiscal quarter. Tech stocks drive market rebound, the Dow lags behind Tech stocks were the biggest winners. The technology sector gained 1.6%, leading the entire market as investors rushed to scoop up shares of companies that had been battered in recent sessions. Nvidia and Palantir Technologies were among the biggest gainers, helping the Nasdaq Composite outperform other indexes. But not every part of the market joined the rally. The Dow Jones Industrial Average struggled, slipping another 0.2% to mark its third straight decline. Investors avoided traditional blue-chip stocks, focusing instead on high-growth tech names. Meanwhile, the Consumer Price Index (CPI) report for February showed inflation cooling, with prices rising 0.2% from the previous month and 2.8% over the past year, which calmed some fears about the economy, but trade concerns kept investors on edge. The Federal Reserve‚Äôs next move remains uncertain. ‚ÄúWe still believe the next Fed rate move is lower, but it is hard to have high confidence with the impact of tariffs still uncertain,‚Äù said Scott Helfstein, head of investment strategy at Global X. Trump‚Äôs tariffs and inflation fears loom over markets Donald Trump‚Äôs new tariffs on steel and aluminum officially went into effect on Wednesday, adding 25% duties on steel imports and 10% on aluminum, regardless of the country of origin. That sent shockwaves through the global economy. In response, Canada fired back with a 25% retaliatory tariff on more than $20 billion worth of U.S. goods. Traders had already been expecting some kind of technical bounce after recent sell-offs, but concerns over Trump‚Äôs trade policies kept the rally in check. The S&P 500 briefly fell into correction territory on Tuesday, slipping 10% below its February record high. The Nasdaq Composite and S&P 500 are both down 3% for the week, while the Dow has dropped 3.4%, making this its worst week since March 2023. More economic reports are due Thursday, including the latest weekly jobless claims and the February producer price index (PPI), a key measure of wholesale inflation. Investors will also be watching earnings from Dollar General and Ulta Beauty to gauge consumer spending trends. Some investors are moving their money away from U.S. markets. ‚ÄúRather than an outright sell-off, what we‚Äôve seen is largely rotation,‚Äù said Michael Green, chief strategist at Simplify Asset Management. ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs been a combination of money rotating out of the United States and into Europe, Japan, and Canada. To a certain extent, that‚Äôs contributed to the weakness in the dollar.‚Äù Green also warned that inflation might not be as contained as some think. ‚ÄúThat likely puts additional pressure on forward inflation trends and offsets some of the benefits of a weaker economy,‚Äù he said. If inflation continues to slow, it could give the Federal Reserve room to cut interest rates if the economy weakens. Volatility traders profit as market swings intensify While most investors have taken losses in recent weeks, volatility traders are cashing in. Since February 18, the S&P 500 has dropped 8.4%, and the Nasdaq Composite has fallen 11.9%. That sharp downturn has sent the Cboe Volatility Index (VIX) soaring. The VIX, often called the ‚Äúfear gauge‚Äù, has spiked 52% over the past month as uncertainty rattles the stock market. ‚ÄúWe make money when markets are in dispossession,‚Äù said Kris Sidial, co-chief investment officer at Ambrus Group, a hedge fund specializing in volatility trading. ‚ÄúMany investors increased their exposure to stocks when Trump was elected, thinking the second term would be like the first. They‚Äôre now seeing they‚Äôre offsides and have to rebalance.‚Äù Sidial and other traders use options strategies to profit from market swings. Michael Nauss, a trader at StatsEdgeTrading, described one approach: ‚ÄúYou buy puts and calls for the same strike price at the same expiration date. It‚Äôs called bracketing and allows traders to make money in both directions.‚Äù Traders are also taking advantage of higher premiums in the options market. ‚ÄúPut buying is expensive right now as investors rush to protect their positions,‚Äù Nauss added. Options trading has exploded in popularity. Robinhood, a major trading platform, reported last week as its biggest week ever for options volume. With stock market uncertainty growing, more investors are turning to derivatives to hedge their bets or speculate on wild price swings. While most analysts still don‚Äôt expect a recession, the odds of an economic downturn have increased since last year. Alec Kersman, a senior executive at Pimco, noted at CNBC‚Äôs CONVERGE LIVE event in Singapore that the chances of a U.S. recession are now higher than in 2024. Meanwhile, Trump‚Äôs tariffs could reshape the global economy, pushing trade partners to find alternatives to U.S. imports. If the trend continues, the U.S. may no longer be the dominant force in global trade. Markets remain in flux, with investors trying to navigate the uncertainty. With the Federal Reserve, inflation, and trade policies all in play, traders are expecting more volatility in the weeks ahead. Cryptopolitan Academy: Tired of market swings?

The 270% increase in Dogecoin network active addresses fails to support its present $0.17 value because the currency decreased 9% since the previous week. The price decline of DOGE has prompted numerous investors who are DOGE millionaires to explore alternative lucrative opportunities. The emerging decentralized finance token Mutuum Finance (MUTM) continues to get noticed through its $3.1 million presale because it shows excellent potential to transform users‚Äô financial returns. Mutuum Finance (MUTM): A DeFi Powerhouse in the Making Mutuum Finance (MUTM) represents something far more than a regular token because it has built a decentralized lending platform with genuine financial value. MUTM functions differently than the speculative cryptocurrency Dogecoin because it enables users to both loan and borrow funds while generating passive revenue using its mtTokens system. User deposits within the MUTM platform are represented by mtTokens that earn sustained interest as the tokens accumulate value for holders. The successful presale shows that the project represents strong potential going forward. Wall Street investors seek rapid participation before the upcoming price jump to $0.025 in Phase 3 where $3.1 million dollars have already been raised. The value of early-phase participation exceeds 25% since early participants maintain their tokens until the following phase completes. The token‚Äôs upcoming listing value that buyers secured today will generate a 400% return on investment because it is priced at $0.06. DOGE Faces Significant Market Challenges Dogecoin faces current difficulties as part of the overall tumultuous behavior within the meme coin market. The token has not surpassed its important resistance zones even though network activity jumped 270% and whales brought in 1.7 billion DOGE during a 72-hour period. The analysis of $0.16 support shows that analysts believe the price may fall to $0.13 in case this area gives way. The speculative nature of DOGE along with its absence of useful applications makes it a dangerous investment option during the current market period. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) delivers a practical value model through its decentralized lending system linked to a buy-and-distribute process which provides sustained price consistency as well as expansion. Mutuum Finance Unique Features The presale structure of Mutuum Finance (MUTM) provides rewards for its initial purchasers. The present price of MUTM at $0.02 enables investors to acquire significant value as the anticipated launch price stands at $0.06. Research analysts see Mutuum Finance (MUTM) reaching $1.50 by 2025 which represents a 7,400 percent increase from its present market value. DogsCoin millionaires currently show strong interest in MUTM tokens because they present a new opportunity for portfolio expansion. As an overcollateralized lending system MUTM ensures stability through its P2P lending feature which offers flexible solutions to borrowers. Through its buy-and-distribute process MUTM maintains steady token demand that both raises prices and bestows market value upon long-term token holders. A Golden Opportunity for Early Investors In its fight to establish dominance Dogecoin is seeing Mutuum Finance (MUTM) take leadership in decentralised financial sector. Phase 3 approach of the presale is ending soon which means investors only have limited time to acquire MUTM tokens at $0.02. Present investors buy early because their holdings will proliferate predominantly when MUTM gains popularity before its stock trading begins on essential exchanges. The cryptocurrency market shows extreme rigors however it provides lucrative chances to early market participants. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) delivers a complete package of novel features and valuable functions along with substantial growth potentials that stand out in the market. The time to act is now. Dogecoin faces a vulnerable future as Mutuum Finance (MUTM) shows potential for strong expansion which is drawing experienced investors to act immediately. Secure MUTM tokens now to benefit from lifelong gains through the market. The next phase is just around the corner, and prices won‚Äôt stay this low for long.

41566531,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=710967,1741831239,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/newsbtc.png,XRP Faces Bearish MVRV Crossover‚ÄîPrice Plunge To Continue?,https://www.newsbtc.com/xrp-news/xrp-faces-bearish-mvrv-crossover-price-plunge/,"On-chain data shows the XRP Market Value to Realized Value (MVRV) Ratio has just gone through a crossover that may not be positive for the asset‚Äôs price. XRP MVRV Ratio Has Dropped Under Its 200-Day MA As pointed out by analyst Ali Martinez in a new post on X, the MVRV Ratio‚Äôs latest crossover may signal a macro trend shift for XRP. The ‚ÄúMVRV Ratio‚Äù refers to an on-chain indicator that keeps track of the ratio between a given asset‚Äôs market cap and its realized cap. Related Reading: Bitcoin Bear Market Is Below This Level, Analyst Reveals The realized cap is a capitalization model that calculates the cryptocurrency‚Äôs ‚Äòtrue‚Äô value by assuming that the real value of any token in circulation is the spot price at which it was last transacted on the network. The previous transaction price of any coin can be considered the value at which its investor purchased it, so the realized cap represents the total amount of capital that the asset‚Äôs holders as a whole spent to purchase their holdings. In contrast, the market cap just tells us what value the investors are holding in the present. Since the MVRV Ratio takes the ratio between these two metrics, it basically signifies the profit-loss status of the market as a whole. The indicator being greater than 1 suggests investors are holding more than they invested, while it being under the mark implies a dominance of underwater tokens. Now, here is the chart shared by the analyst that shows the trend in the XRP MVRV Ratio, as well as its 200-day moving average (MA), over the last few months: As displayed in the above graph, the XRP MVRV Ratio has witnessed a plunge recently as a result of the drawdown that the cryptocurrency‚Äôs price has gone through. Though, despite the price crash, the indicator‚Äôs value continues to be well above the 1 level, meaning that the investors of the asset are still largely in the green. That said, there is one important level that the metric has indeed dipped below due to the downtrend: the 200-day MA. Related Reading: Solana Falls Under Realized Price: Here‚Äôs What Happened Last Time The MVRV Ratio broke above the level in the last few months of 2024 and remained above it until this breakdown. From the chart, it‚Äôs apparent that the previous crossover proved to be a bullish signal for XRP. Now that the reverse crossover has occurred, the analyst has noted that another potential macro trend shift could be ahead for the cryptocurrency‚Äôs price. It only remains to be seen whether the asset will continue to decline in the coming days and confirm the pattern or not. XRP Price At the time of writing, XRP is floating around 2.23, up more than 5% over the last seven days.

While Elon Musk, Jeff Bezos, Mark Zuckerberg, Larry Page, Bill Gates, Larry Ellison, Bernard Arnault, and Michael Dell are seeing billions wiped from their portfolios, Warren is sitting on a $334 billion cash pile that is untouched by the stock market collapse. Warren has spent the past nine quarters selling stocks instead of buying, including massive exits from Apple, Bank of America, and Citigroup. The decision was confusing at first, but now, as Wall Street tanks and tech stocks crumble due to fears that president Donald Trump‚Äôs tariff policies and trade war threats would send the economy into a recession, Warren was clearly one step ahead‚Äîagain. Warren dumped Apple and banks before the collapse As per usual, Warren saw what others didn‚Äôt. While investors were still riding the highs of a Trump-driven market rally, he was cashing out. Apple had just topped, Wall Street was setting records, and everyone thought stocks would keep climbing, but Warren wasn‚Äôt convinced. He sold billions in Apple shares and cut his stakes in Bank of America and Citigroup right before Trump took office again. His cash reserves surged to $334 billion, making up one-third of Berkshire Hathaway‚Äôs portfolio . Warren Buffett with late best friend Charlie Munger, who was the vice chairman of Berkshire Hathaway. Source: Robyn Twomey/Redux/laif To put that into perspective, that‚Äôs more than the entire value of every single company on the FTSE 100 combined together. Then came the crash on Monday when the Nasdaq dropped by 4% in a single day, its biggest decline in three years. Tech stocks tumbled, and the investors who had doubled down on the AI boom got crushed, but oh not Warren. Wall Street panics, but Warren waits Warren has been in the game long enough to know when to bet big and when to hold back. His strategy is simple: ‚ÄúBe fearful when others are greedy and greedy when others are fearful,‚Äù he has said. In the 90s, when LTCM, a major hedge fund, collapsed, Warren tried to bail it out with a $250 million rescue offer. In the 2008 financial crisis, when Goldman Sachs was on the verge of collapse, Warren stepped in with $5 billion, securing a deal that earned him a $3 billion profit. Warren also partnered with 3G Capital to buy Kraft Heinz, a decision he justified with one word: ‚ÄúKetchup.‚Äù In 2017, Warren tried to acquire Unilever for $143 billion, but the company‚Äôs board shut him down. This time, though, he‚Äôs not looking to save anyone. While other investors are scrambling for cover, Warren is sitting back and waiting for better opportunities. His greatness is truly unfathomable. Berkshire‚Äôs next moves and Warren‚Äôs latest bets But Warren hasn‚Äôt completely walked away from stocks. In Q4 2024, he opened a position in Constellation Brands (STZ), the parent company of Corona beer, while dumping Ulta Beauty (ULTA) just a few quarters after buying it. Warren held onto Apple and Chevron after making major cuts earlier in the year. But he reduced more of his holdings in Bank of America, Nu Holdings, and Citigroup, showing that he‚Äôs still wary of the financial sector. And then there‚Äôs crypto. Warren has made it very clear that he hates crypto, but through Nu Holdings, a major crypto-friendly bank, he technically has exposure to it. The irony? Trump, the only pro-crypto president the U.S. has ever had, is back in office‚Äîbut Warren doesn‚Äôt like him either. Source: Warren Buffett Twitter/X One thing Warren isn‚Äôt doing? Buying back Berkshire Hathaway shares. Despite record earnings, Berkshire has halted stock buybacks for two straight quarters. Warren seems to believe there are better places to put his money, and right now, that doesn‚Äôt include his own company. Instead, he‚Äôs increasing his stake in five Japanese trading houses, a move he started nearly six years ago. He‚Äôs not saying how much he‚Äôll buy, but in his words, ‚ÄúOver time, you will likely see Berkshire‚Äôs ownership of all five increase somewhat.‚Äù Warren‚Äôs instincts have made him a key player in some of Wall Street‚Äôs biggest deals as well as the greatest investor of all time. The market is falling apart, but Warren? He‚Äôs just waiting. Cryptopolitan Academy: Coming Soon - A New Way to Earn Passive Income with DeFi in 2025.

Crypto-wide trading volume has been dropping since it peaked in February amid dip-buying opportunities. According to CoinGecko data , daily trading volume hit its highest level this year in early February when it reached $440 billion. It has since sunk by 63% to $163 billion on March 12. Market data firm CoinMarketCap has slightly lower figures but they show the same trend ‚Äî that volume peaked in 2025 in early March before falling back 52% to current levels. Analytics firm Santiment said on X on March 13 that this decline in volume suggests that trader enthusiasm for the asset class is diminishing. ‚ÄúWhen trading volume for major cryptocurrencies consistently drops, even during slight price recoveries, it typically points toward diminishing trader enthusiasm.‚Äù Santiment added that trader behavior ‚Äúindicates a mix of exhaustion, hopelessness, and capitulation‚Äù following further market capitalization declines over the past fortnight. Declining crypto trading volume. Source: Santiment Total market capitalization has declined almost 25% since the beginning of February, shrinking by $900 billion as the crypto market correction deepens. Those declines have accelerated over the past 10 days when markets have lost 15% as fears of a recession in the United States increased amid escalating global trade tensions . Santiment stated that traders are becoming cautious, suggesting they might not believe that the current upward price movements will last. ‚ÄúEssentially, reduced trading activity reflects uncertainty, as fewer traders are convinced that buying at current levels will yield profitable outcomes,‚Äù the analysts added. Weakening trading volume amid minor price bounces can serve as an ‚Äúearly warning sign of weakening market momentum,‚Äù Santiment reported, adding that without robust buying participation, price gains can quickly lose steam, ‚Äúas there simply isn‚Äôt enough underlying support to sustain the upward trend.‚Äù ‚ÄúThis leads to the possibility that any rebound could be temporary, with prices vulnerable to another downturn.‚Äù Related: Bitcoin high-entry buyers are driving sell pressure, price may ‚Äòfloor‚Äô at $70K However, shrinking volume during minor rebounds isn‚Äôt necessarily a direct bearish signal, it said, adding that volume is a metric that measures participation from both retail and institutional traders and it needs to start rising before prices do. ‚ÄúTo signal a healthier and more sustainable recovery, bulls generally will want to see both rising prices and rising volumes simultaneously.‚Äù Crypto market capitalization is currently around $2.8 trillion, which is where it was this time last year before seven months of consolidation followed. Meanwhile, the Crypto Fear & Greed Index remains in ‚Äúfear‚Äù territory, below 50, where it has been since Feb. 21.

Among the top meme coins for exponential returns, Arctic Pablo Coin ($APC) and Dogwifhat ($WIF) have emerged as notable contenders. While Dogwifhat has experienced significant volatility, Arctic Pablo Coin presents a fresh opportunity with its innovative presale structure and compelling narrative. Arctic Pablo Coin: A New Frontier in Meme Coins Enter Arctic Pablo Coin ($APC), a meme coin that intertwines storytelling with investment opportunities. The narrative follows Arctic Pablo, an intrepid explorer navigating icy terrains and uncovering mystical $APC coins. This imaginative storyline engages potential investors and sets the stage for a unique presale experience. Unlike traditional presales divided into stages, Arctic Pablo Coin‚Äôs presale is conceptualized as a journey through various locations, each representing a presale phase. As Arctic Pablo traverses these enchanted realms, the price of $APC increases at each location, irrespective of the number of tokens sold. This innovative approach creates a sense of urgency and adventure, encouraging investors to join the expedition early to maximize potential returns. Currently, Arctic Pablo has arrived at Frosty Falls, the 14th location in this journey, with $APC priced at $0.000074. The presale has raised over $1.86 million, reflecting strong community interest and investor confidence. With a launch price set at $0.008, early investors have the potential to realize returns exceeding 10,694.59% from the Frosty Falls phase to the listing price. Arctic Pablo Coin employs a deflationary mechanism to enhance scarcity and value by permanently burning unsold tokens weekly during the presale. Tokens remaining after the presale will also be burned, fostering a deflationary environment that benefits investors by potentially increasing the value of the remaining tokens. Beyond the presale, Arctic Pablo Coin offers a staking program with an impressive 66% Annual Percentage Yield (APY). Investors can stake their $APC tokens and enjoy generous rewards, promoting long-term engagement and network security. All staked coins will be vested for two months after the launch, ensuring a stable and committed staking environment. It stands among the Top New Meme Coins for Exponential Returns . Dogwifhat: The Rise and Volatility of a Meme Coin Dogwifhat burst onto the crypto scene with the charm of its canine mascot donning a whimsical hat, quickly capturing the attention of meme coin enthusiasts. Built on the Solana blockchain, $WIF capitalized on the popularity of dog-themed cryptocurrencies, drawing parallels to predecessors like Dogecoin and Shiba Inu. Its community-driven approach and viral appeal contributed to a meteoric rise, with $WIF reaching an all-time high of $4.83 in March 2024, delivering substantial gains to early investors. However, the volatile nature of meme coins became evident as Dogwifhat‚Äôs price experienced significant fluctuations. As of March 12, 2025, $WIF is trading at approximately $0.436, reflecting a sharp decline from its peak. This downturn has been attributed to factors such as market corrections and challenges within the broader crypto ecosystem. Despite these setbacks, Dogwifhat maintains a dedicated community and continues to be a topic of interest among meme coin investors. Conclusion: Seize the Opportunity with Arctic Pablo Coin Based on our research and market trends, Arctic Pablo Coin stands out among the top new meme coins for exponential returns. Its innovative presale structure, compelling narrative, and strategic tokenomics create a unique investment opportunity. As Arctic Pablo‚Äôs journey progresses, each new location signifies not just a phase in the presale but also an invitation for investors to embark on this adventure.

The token surged from less than $10 on January 18th to a high of $74.59 on January 20th before quickly surrendering some gains within hours. Although the token remained competitive days after the president‚Äôs inauguration, by trading above $30, it quickly faded under pressure.

While most traders lost billions of dollars during its crash, a sizeable number of early investors cashed in for huge profits. Early Investors Cash Out Before Listing In Major Exchanges According to 10x Research, most early investors cashed in just before major exchanges listed the coin, as its value moved past $60 and briefly hit $70. The coin‚Äôs rapid surge in price was welcomed by everyone, with the early investors getting the best seats in the house. After its quick rise, TRUMP suffered a massive drop.

With the TRUMP token, the value significantly dropped within the week. By looking at the bigger picture, TRUMP token shed more than 80% since its peak last January. And on-chain data suggests that early investors quickly liquidated their positions, with retail and small traders used as pawns. Solana Chain Takes A Hit The Solana ecosystem is one of the biggest losers in the token‚Äôs crash. Aside from TRUMP, a few other Solana-based tokens faced selling pressure, including Raydium‚Äôs RAY token, which dropped by 60% in the last month. Even Solana‚Äôs native token, SOL, dropped by over 40% over the same period. The drop in value for SOL-based tokens suggests that the interest in meme coins or speculative tokens is waning.

Data shared by the blockchain data platform Santiment in a March 12 X post shows Tether‚Äôs ( USDT ) onchain activity has been on the rise, peaking with over 143,000 wallets making transfers on March 11, the highest in six months. ‚ÄúWhen USDT & other stablecoin activity spikes during price drops, traders are preparing to buy. Added buy pressure aids in crypto prices recovering,‚Äù Santiment said. Onchain activity for Tethers USDT has spiked, reaching a sixth-month high. Source: Santiment It comes as Bitcoin ( BTC ) dropped to a four-month low of $76,700 on March 11 , as the wider crypto market shed even more of the gains made post-US election amid macroeconomic uncertainty and an escalating tariff war. Speaking to Cointelegraph, Vincent Liu, chief investment officer at Kronos Research, said traders often accumulate Tether during dips to position themselves for buying opportunities, adding buy pressure that can help crypto prices recover. He speculates the uptick in USDT wallet activity likely reflects traders capitalizing on recent market volatility . ‚ÄúPossible causes include broader economic uncertainties, crypto-specific events like regulatory developments or post-election sentiment shifts, and Tether‚Äôs role as a stable haven, making it an ideal holding for investors preparing to deploy capital strategically,‚Äù Liu said. Related: Bitcoin, crypto ‚Äòdip buy hype‚Äô is now at its highest level in 7 months Liu says the surge in USDT activity is a bullish indicator, suggesting significant buying power on the sidelines, but the crypto market‚Äôs recovery will likely depend on factors like macroeconomic conditions, regulatory clarity, and investor confidence. ‚ÄúHowever, with the inflation rate easing to 2.8% in February, lower than expected in recent CPI data, this could reduce pressure on crypto prices and signal a more favorable environment,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúAdditionally, the upcoming Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) on March 18th may provide further indications on interest rates and monetary policy, potentially influencing market development and recovery,‚Äù Liu added. A key Bitcoin and crypto sentiment tracker, the Crypto Fear & Greed Index, hit its lowest score in over two years on Feb. 26 as it slipped deeper into ‚ÄúExtreme Fear,‚Äù reaching a score of 10. Crypto sentiment has staged a recovery since, but the index has still registered a score of 45 on March 13, still in fear territory.

While blockchain networks like Ethereum ( ETH ) have made significant strides in their adoption, they still face challenges surrounding these core aspects. Enter ZKPs (zero-knowledge proofs) ‚Äì a cryptographic breakthrough that is quickly becoming a game-changer in the blockchain world. In this article, we will explore how ZKPs are improving blockchain ecosystems by offering privacy-preserving features, enhancing scalability and enabling new use cases across industries. Understanding ZKPs At its core, a ZKP is a cryptographic protocol that allows one party to prove to another that a statement is true without revealing any additional information about the statement itself. In the context of blockchain, ZKPs can be used to verify transactions or other data on a network while keeping sensitive information private. For instance, a user could prove that they have enough funds to complete a transaction on a blockchain without disclosing the actual amount in their wallet or the details of the transaction. This concept of privacy ‚Äì coupled with the ability to verify data without exposing it ‚Äì is what makes ZKPs such a powerful tool for blockchain scalability and security. There are two primary types of ZKPs in the blockchain space. ZK-SNARKs (zero-knowledge succinct non-interactive argument of knowledge) ‚Äì A powerful cryptographic technique that enables fast, non-interactive proofs. They are particularly useful for applications requiring scalability, such as Ethereum‚Äôs ZK-rollups. ZK-STARKs (zero-knowledge scalable transparent argument of knowledge) ‚Äì These offer stronger security guarantees and are designed to be more scalable, as they don‚Äôt require a trusted setup, unlike ZK-SNARKs. ZKPs in action ‚Äì b lockchain privacy and security As blockchain adoption grows, privacy concerns have become one of the most pressing issues for users and regulators alike. ZKPs offer an elegant solution to this problem. By allowing users to prove the validity of transactions without revealing any sensitive data, ZKPs help maintain privacy while still ensuring that the transaction is valid. A good example of ZKPs in action is Zcash ( ZEC ), a privacy-focused cryptocurrency that leverages ZK-SNARKs to allow private transactions. Zcash users can send funds without revealing the transaction amounts or addresses involved, making it one of the most secure and privacy-preserving blockchains in the crypto space. In addition to privacy, ZKPs provide an extra layer of security. By ensuring that data is only validated through cryptographic proofs, they significantly reduce the risk of fraudulent or malicious activity on the network. For enterprises and individuals looking to use blockchain technology for confidential applications, this is a huge advantage. Scalability ‚Äì h ow ZKPs are enhancing blockchain networks While privacy and security are crucial, scalability remains a critical bottleneck for blockchain networks. As DApps (decentralized applications) and transactions grow in volume, traditional blockchain networks ‚Äì especially those using PoW (Proof-of-Work) ‚Äì struggle to keep up with demand due to network congestion and high fees. This is where ZK-rollups ‚Äì a layer-two scaling solution based on ZKPs ‚Äì come into play. ZK-rollups aggregate large numbers of transactions into a single proof, allowing the main chain to process them more efficiently. Since only a single proof needs to be posted on-chain, the scalability of the entire network improves dramatically, resulting in lower fees and faster transaction speeds. Ethereum, for example, has integrated ZK-rollups as part of its broader scalability solutions through the Ethereum 2.0 upgrade. Platforms like Loopring and zkSync have already begun utilizing ZK-rollups, significantly improving transaction throughput while maintaining the security of the Ethereum network. The real-world adoption of ZKPs The potential of ZKPs extends beyond just privacy and scalability. Several industry leaders and blockchain projects are already integrating ZKPs to solve real-world problems. Polygon ‚Äì One of the most prominent layer-two solutions for Ethereum, Polygon is working on integrating ZK-rollups into its ecosystem to further improve scalability and reduce costs for DeFi users. StarkWare ‚Äì By utilizing ZK-STARKs, StarkWare is enhancing scalability solutions for DApps and enterprise solutions. Optimism ‚Äì While Optimism focuses on optimistic rollups, there is increasing exploration of how ZKPs can work in conjunction with optimistic rollups to improve overall system efficiency. As these examples show, ZKPs are not just theoretical ‚Äì they are actively being used to address blockchain‚Äôs most pressing challenges. ZKPs ‚Äì The future of blockchain privacy, scalability and innovation The continued development and adoption of ZKPs will play a pivotal role in shaping the future of blockchain technology. As more blockchain networks adopt ZKPs, we can expect to see increased privacy protections, reduced network congestion and greater scalability. This will unlock new opportunities for DeFi (decentralized finance), gaming and enterprise applications. Moreover, the ability to preserve privacy while maintaining full transparency will likely become a standard expectation in blockchain protocols. ZKPs are not only advancing the usability of blockchain networks but also paving the way for a future where blockchain is used for a wide range of applications ‚Äì from secure voting systems and confidential data sharing to scalable financial services. Conclusion ZKPs are fast becoming a cornerstone of blockchain innovation. With their ability to enhance privacy, security and scalability, ZKPs will enable the next wave of growth and adoption for blockchain technology. As ZKPs continue to evolve, we are likely to see a transformation in the way blockchain networks operate ‚Äì ushering in a more private, efficient and secure decentralized future. For developers, investors and blockchain enthusiasts, understanding ZKPs and their applications will be key to staying ahead in the rapidly advancing world of crypto innovation.

According to the economic latest data released on Mar. 12, February‚Äôs Consumer Price Index rose 2.8%, below the 2.9% forecast. Core CPI, which excludes food and energy, dropped to 3.1%, slightly better than the expected 3.2%. Markets responded by increasing bets on Federal Reserve rate cuts. Traders now price in a 31.4% chance of a cut in May, up from just 9% last month. The probability of three cuts by year-end jumped to 32.5%, while expectations for four cuts surged from 1% to 21%. Bitcoin ( BTC ) briefly surpassed $84,000 before falling back to $83,000, wiping off the majority of its post-CPI gains, despite the softer inflation data. Equities were unable to sustain early gains, and other financial markets also suffered. Analysts point to ongoing trade tensions as a key factor limiting risk appetite. Canada recently responded to U.S. steel and aluminum tariffs with $21 billion in tariffs on U.S. exports. The European Union then imposed additional tariffs on American goods valued at $28 billion. There is growing concern that rising trade disputes may raise inflationary pressures and complicate the Federal Reserve‚Äôs decision-making.

Market uncertainty remains high, with investors closely watching developments in both monetary policy and global trade. On-chain data, meanwhile, indicates that cryptocurrency traders are losing confidence. Crypto-wide trading activity has been declining since its peak in late February, according to Santiment.

According to data from Dune Analytics, 701 out of the 1327 active Solana ( SOL ) validators have voted. 1.2% have abstained, 17.2% are against the proposal, and 37.5% are in favor. If SIMD-228 were approved, it would drastically cut staking rewards, reducing the amount of fresh SOL tokens entering circulation. There have been some concerns about how this would affect the network‚Äôs decentralization, even though it might lessen selling pressure. Currently, Solana‚Äôs inflation models depend on striking a balance between transaction fee burning and staking rewards. More fees are burnt during periods of heavy network traffic, which helps to counter inflation. However as transaction costs have decreased, fewer tokens are being removed from circulation. Staking incentives keep adding fresh SOL supply at a 6.8% inflation rate, which may drive down its price. SIMD-228 would lower staking rewards, reducing supply, and possibly increasing the value of SOL. However, smaller validators with low or no commission rates would find it difficult to remain profitable and might even be forced out. If enough validators leave, the decentralization of the network may weaken, which raises questions about its long-term viability. Before choosing SIMD-228, Solana developers looked at a number of options, including ones with fixed-rate adjustments. Meanwhile, Solana‚Äôs market performance has been poor in the past few weeks. As of Mar. 13, SOL is trading at $126, more than 50% down its peak of $293 in January. According to DefiLlama data , decentralized finance activity has decreased, as seen by the network‚Äôs total value locked falling from $12 billion in January to $7 billion. Due to low network usage especially as memecoin trading cools off, monthly fees have also dropped significantly, from $250 million in January to $89 million in February. Supply pressure may be reduced if SIMD-228 is approved, but its success relies on the expanding network demand. Reducing inflation by itself might not be enough to drive a strong recovery in the absence of more users and activity,",News|decentralization|layer 1|Solana,EN,0,0,SOL|TRADING|MARKET,"{'name': 'crypto.news', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/73/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",crypto_news,2025-03-13 03:56:49

Ledger Donjon acknowledged Trezor has made several security advancements of late but found cryptographic operations could still be performed on the microcontroller of Trezor‚Äôs Safe 3 and 5 models, which could make them ‚Äúvulnerable to more advanced attacks.‚Äù Fortunately, Trezor has since addressed the vulnerabilities found, Ledger‚Äôs chief technology officer Charles Guillemet said in a March 12 X post. ‚ÄúWe believe that making the ecosystem more secure helps everyone, and is critical as we push towards broader adoption of crypto and digital assets,‚Äù Guillemet added. Source: Charles Guillemet Trezor had already implemented ‚ÄúSecure Elements‚Äù ‚Äî chips designed to protect the user's PIN code and cryptographic secrets ‚Äî as some of Trezor‚Äôs devices could be tampered with by modifying the software running on it, potentially allowing threat actors to steal user funds. The Secure Elements feature ‚Äúeffectively thwarts any inexpensive hardware attack, in particular voltage glitching,‚Äù Ledger said in a March 12 post. ‚Äú[This] gives users confidence that their funds are safe even if their device gets misplaced or stolen.‚Äù However, Ledger found another potential attack vector stemmed from the microcontroller, the other main part of Trezor‚Äôs two-chip design for its Safe 3 and 5 models. Trezor implemented a firmware integrity check to detect modified software, but Ledger was able to demonstrate that an attacker could still bypass this security check. This issue has since been resolved by Trezor ‚Äî though neither Ledger nor Trezor have explained how. Cointelegraph reached out to Trezor but didn‚Äôt receive an immediate response. Trezor‚Äôs microcontroller in the Trezor Safe 3 model. Source: Ledger Trezor confirmed on X that user funds remain safe and that no action is required. Related: ‚ÄòDark Skippy‚Äô method can steal Bitcoin hardware wallet keys However, when asked whether Trezor was able to patch this issue via firmware, the hardware wallet provider responded: ‚ÄúUnfortunately not.‚Äù ‚ÄúIn cybersecurity, the golden rule is simple: nothing is fully unbreakable. That‚Äôs why we have already implemented a multi-layer defense against supply chain attacks and always advise our users to purchase from official sources.‚Äù Ledger isn‚Äôt immune to security vulnerabilities either. In December 2023, a hacker committed a security breach into Ledger‚Äôs connector library and stole $484,000 worth of crypto assets. Another threat actor who breached Ledger‚Äôs systems published the mailing addresses of around 270,000 Ledger customers in June 2020.

However, in the shorter time frame, signs of potential reversal are emerging. Over the past 24 hours, Bitcoin has seen a slight recovery, with its price rising to $81,647. This shift has led analysts to closely examine whale activity and exchange trends to determine whether the correction phase may be nearing an end. Related Reading: Bitcoin‚Äôs SOPR Nears Critical Level‚ÄîIs a Deeper Correction Ahead? Binance‚Äôs Whale Activity and Its Impact on Bitcoin‚Äôs Trend One of CryptoQuant‚Äôs analysts, Darkfost, has identified a key trend in Binance‚Äôs whale activity that could impact Bitcoin‚Äôs price movements. Binance, as the largest cryptocurrency exchange by volume, plays a significant role in market liquidity, making its whale activity an important metric to monitor. Darkfost‚Äôs analysis of the Bitcoin Exchange Whale Ratio on Binance suggests that whales are reducing their selling pressure, which could signal a shift in market sentiment. The exchange whale ratio measures the proportion of the top 10 inflows to total inflows on an exchange. When this ratio is elevated, it indicates increased whale selling activity, often contributing to short-term price corrections or market consolidation phases. Conversely, a declining whale ratio suggests less selling pressure, which could help stabilize Bitcoin‚Äôs price or even contribute to a rebound. According to Darkfost, the declining whale ratio on Binance may indicate that the selling pressure from large Bitcoin holders is easing. Historically, a decrease in whale selling activity has preceded bullish market movements, making this metric a key indicator for traders. If this trend persists, Bitcoin could see reduced downward momentum, potentially setting the stage for price stabilization or recovery. Binance‚Äôs Dominance in Spot and Futures Trading In a separate analysis, CryptoQuant analyst Crazzyblockk has highlighted Binance‚Äôs continued dominance in both spot and futures markets. Binance holds the largest market share in crypto trading, reinforcing its position as a key player in price discovery and liquidity. Currently, Binance accounts for a 45.5% share of the USDT futures market, significantly ahead of other trading platforms. Crazzyblockk wrote: This highlights Binance as the preferred choice for derivatives trading, offering the best liquidity and execution. Related Reading: Bitcoin To Bottom Around $70,000?

A significant announcement just dropped from one of the biggest names in the crypto exchange world. Coinbase, a leading platform for buying, selling, and managing digital currencies, has declared it will be ending support for three specific tokens ‚Äì FLOKI (FLOKI), Turbo (TURBO), and Gigachad (GIGA) ‚Äì for its New York-based users. This news, delivered via a concise update on X, has sent ripples through the crypto community, raising questions about regulatory pressures and the future availability of certain digital assets in specific regions. Let‚Äôs dive into the details of this urgent development and unpack what it means for you. Why is Coinbase Delisting Tokens in New York? Coinbase‚Äôs decision to halt support for FLOKI, TURBO, and GIGA for New York users boils down to their commitment to maintaining high listing standards and adhering to regulatory frameworks. In their announcement, Coinbase explicitly stated that they regularly monitor the digital assets listed on their platform to ensure they continue to meet their stringent listing criteria . While the specifics behind why these particular tokens no longer meet these criteria for New York users weren‚Äôt detailed, it‚Äôs highly likely to be linked to the evolving landscape of crypto regulations , especially within the state of New York. New York is known for having some of the strictest regulatory environments for cryptocurrencies in the United States. The state‚Äôs Department of Financial Services (NYDFS) operates under a framework that requires virtual currency businesses to obtain a ‚ÄòBitLicense‚Äô to operate within the state. This license is notoriously difficult to acquire and maintain, demanding rigorous compliance and reporting standards. It‚Äôs plausible that FLOKI, TURBO, and GIGA, or the way they are structured or traded, might not align with the NYDFS‚Äôs current requirements, leading Coinbase to preemptively discontinue support to remain compliant. Here‚Äôs a quick breakdown of the key factors likely contributing to Coinbase‚Äôs decision: Stringent New York Regulations: New York‚Äôs BitLicense and regulatory scrutiny are among the toughest in the US, requiring exchanges to be extremely cautious about the assets they offer. Ongoing Asset Monitoring: Coinbase actively reviews listed assets to ensure they continuously meet their internal standards and legal requirements. Proactive Compliance: Delisting tokens might be a proactive step by Coinbase to avoid potential regulatory conflicts and maintain its operational license in New York. Risk Mitigation: Certain tokens might be deemed as carrying higher regulatory or compliance risks in New York, prompting exchanges to remove them. Impact of Crypto Regulations on Exchanges and Users The Coinbase delisting incident serves as a stark reminder of the significant impact crypto regulations have on both cryptocurrency exchanges and their users. Regulatory uncertainty and varying compliance standards across different jurisdictions create a complex operating environment for exchanges. This can lead to: Limited Asset Availability: Users in highly regulated regions like New York may have access to a smaller selection of cryptocurrencies compared to users in less regulated areas. Increased Compliance Costs: Exchanges face higher operational costs in complying with diverse and evolving regulations, which can sometimes be passed on to users through fees or limited services. Market Fragmentation: Differing regulatory approaches can fragment the cryptocurrency market, creating regional discrepancies in asset availability and trading rules. Potential for Delistings: As regulations tighten or become clearer, exchanges might need to delist certain tokens to maintain compliance, disrupting users who hold those assets. For users in New York specifically, this situation highlights the importance of understanding the regulatory landscape of their state and how it affects their cryptocurrency activities. It also underscores the need to stay informed about exchange policies and potential changes in asset support. What Happens to Your FLOKI, TURBO, and GIGA on Coinbase? If you are a Coinbase user in New York holding FLOKI, TURBO, or GIGA, it‚Äôs crucial to understand what this delisting means for you and what actions you need to take. Here‚Äôs a clear timeline and actionable steps: Date & Time Action Details April 14, 2 PM ET Trading Discontinued Coinbase will cease trading for FLOKI, TURBO, and GIGA for New York users. You will no longer be able to buy or sell these tokens on Coinbase if you are in New York. After April 14, 2 PM ET Withdrawal Only You will still be able to withdraw your FLOKI, TURBO, and GIGA tokens from Coinbase to an external wallet that supports these assets. Recommended Action Plan Your Next Steps If you hold these tokens on Coinbase and are in New York, decide whether to withdraw them to a personal wallet or sell them before the delisting date if possible (depending on trading availability before April 14, 2 PM ET). Actionable Insights for New York Users: Check Your Portfolio: Immediately review if you hold any FLOKI, TURBO, or GIGA on your Coinbase account. Plan for Withdrawal: If you wish to keep holding these tokens, ensure you have a compatible external wallet and understand the withdrawal process on Coinbase. Consider Selling (If Possible): Depending on market conditions and your investment strategy, you might consider selling these tokens before the trading halt, if trading is still available leading up to April 14th. Stay Informed: Keep an eye on Coinbase‚Äôs official communication channels for any further updates or instructions. Navigating Crypto Regulations and Exchange Delistings The situation with Coinbase delisting tokens in New York underscores a broader trend in the cryptocurrency space: the increasing influence of regulatory oversight. As the industry matures, regulatory bodies worldwide are stepping up their efforts to provide frameworks for digital assets. While these regulations aim to protect investors and ensure market integrity, they also bring challenges for exchanges and users alike. For cryptocurrency users, navigating this evolving landscape requires: Due Diligence: Research and understand the regulatory environment in your jurisdiction and how it impacts your crypto activities. Choosing Compliant Exchanges: Opt for exchanges that demonstrate a strong commitment to regulatory compliance, even if it means slightly fewer asset choices. Diversification of Platforms: Consider using multiple exchanges or decentralized platforms to mitigate risks associated with regional restrictions or delistings on a single platform. Staying Updated: Continuously monitor regulatory news and exchange announcements to adapt your strategies proactively. Conclusion: Staying Ahead in a Regulated Crypto World Coinbase‚Äôs decision to discontinue support for FLOKI, TURBO, and GIGA in New York is a significant event that highlights the growing intersection of crypto regulations and exchange operations. For users in New York , it‚Äôs a call to action to understand the implications and take necessary steps to manage their holdings. More broadly, it‚Äôs a signal to the entire crypto community about the increasing importance of regulatory compliance and the need to navigate the digital asset space with awareness and adaptability. As the cryptocurrency landscape continues to evolve, staying informed and proactive will be key to thriving in this dynamic and increasingly regulated environment.

SOL price is now consolidating and might struggle to recover above the $132 resistance. SOL price started a fresh decline below the $150 and $140 levels against the US Dollar. The price is now trading below $130 and the 100-hourly simple moving average. There is a short-term rising channel forming with support at $124 on the hourly chart of the SOL/USD pair (data source from Kraken). The pair could start a fresh increase if the bulls clear the $132 zone. Solana Price Faces Resistance Solana price struggled to clear the $155 resistance and started a fresh decline, like Bitcoin and Ethereum . SOL declined below the $140 and $132 support levels. It even dived below the $120 level. The recent low was formed at $114 before the price recovered some losses. It climbed above the $120 and $122 levels. The price surpassed the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $151 swing high to the $114 swing low. Solana is now trading below $130 and the 100-hourly simple moving average. There is also a short-term rising channel forming with support at $124 on the hourly chart of the SOL/USD pair. On the upside, the price is facing resistance near the $128 level. The next major resistance is near the $130 level. The main resistance could be $132 and the 50% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $151 swing high to the $114 swing low. A successful close above the $132 resistance zone could set the pace for another steady increase. The next key resistance is $140. Any more gains might send the price toward the $150 level. Another Decline in SOL? If SOL fails to rise above the $132 resistance, it could start another decline. Initial support on the downside is near the $124 zone. The first major support is near the $120 level. A break below the $120 level might send the price toward the $114 zone.

The Ethereum price remains accumulated within a narrow range, hinting at the possibility of an excess price compression. As a result, the bulls are unable to exert pressure, as it could fade quickly with the bears possessing a significant dominance. Therefore, the ETH price could be stuck in a bearish well, but from a wider perspective, the token has laid a bear trap, which could result in a 200% upswing in the next 3 to 6 months. Will ETH Price Reach $5000? The latest pullback in the ETH price has compelled the token to lose one of its pivotal supports that it has held since July 2022. After the drop, the bearish activity reduced without an attempt to drag the price lower close to $1500. This suggests the bulls remain vigilant and are preventing excess price drain. Moreover, the historical price pattern suggests the ongoing consolidation has happened before, which has triggered a 175% rise to form a new ATH at $4,870. With similar trading conditions, the ETH price is believed to rise and form a new ATH slightly above $5000, but the current market dynamics display a diverse price action. The historical price action of Ethereum suggests the price is very close to a complete bearish exhaustion phase. The weekly RSI is about to hit the lower threshold, which has happened after the price marked ATH in 2018 and 2021. The drop in RSI came in time with the rise in the bearish activity, leading the token towards the bottom of the descending trend. Currently, the ETH price seems to be an inch away from marking the bottoms, which could be close to $1500 as RSI remains at 33, and a drop below 20 could trigger a strong rebound. Therefore, the Ethereum price could maintain a continued descending trend and test the local support at $1580. Here the bulls are expected to trigger a rebound and initiate a strong ascending trend towards a new ATH, probably above $5000.",Price Analysis|Ethereum,EN,0,0,TRADING|ETH|MARKET,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-03-13 05:15:05

But with hundreds of projects launching every month, which ones are actually worth holding for the long haul? One coin that‚Äôs got serious long-term potential is BTFD Coin, a rapidly growing meme project that‚Äôs already raised over $6.31 million in presale and has a massive 3,650% ROI potential on the horizon. With its $0.006 target price making waves among analysts, it‚Äôs quickly becoming a major talking point in the crypto community. Alongside BTFD, Floki Inu, Brett, and Peanut the Squirrel are also grabbing investor attention. Let‚Äôs dive into why these are the best cryptos to hold long term before they explode even further. BTFD Coin: The Bulls Squad Is Gearing Up for a Massive Breakout If there‚Äôs one meme coin making waves in presale, it‚Äôs BTFD Coin . This community-driven powerhouse has already pulled in over $6.31 million, with more than 71 billion tokens sold and a loyal army of 11,300+ holders joining its Bulls Squad. The hype around BTFD isn‚Äôt slowing down, and for good reason‚Äîit‚Äôs being hailed as one of the best cryptos to hold long term, with analysts predicting explosive growth post-launch. What‚Äôs driving the FOMO? Analysts forecast a 3,650% ROI, thanks to BTFD‚Äôs projected $0.006 moon price after listing. Right now, the presale is still open at just $0.00016, but this price won‚Äôt last much longer. With each presale stage, the entry price climbs, making the window for early investors tighter by the day. The best time to secure BTFD at its lowest available price is right now before the current presale phase ends. A $10,000 investment in Stage 14 at $0.00016 would secure 62,500,000 BTFD tokens. Once BTFD hits its expected $0.0006 listing price, that investment jumps to $37,500. If BTFD reaches its moon price of $0.006, that same $10,000 turns into an eye-watering $375,000. And that‚Äôs before even factoring in BTFD‚Äôs 90% APY staking, which lets holders earn passive income simply by holding onto their tokens. To buy BTFD Coin at the presale price, investors need to set up MetaMask or Trust Wallet, load it with BNB, ETH, or USDT, and head to the BTFD presale page to complete their purchase before the next price increase. Why did this coin make it to this list? BTFD Coin‚Äôs presale momentum, Bulls Squad growth, and 3,650% ROI potential make it one of the best cryptos to hold long term, offering investors a golden opportunity before its price surges post-listing. Floki Inu: The People‚Äôs Crypto With Expanding Utility Floki Inu (FLOKI) has built a reputation as a meme coin with serious staying power. What started as a Dogecoin-inspired project has evolved into a full-fledged ecosystem featuring NFTs, DeFi integration, and play-to-earn gaming. The Floki Ecosystem continues to expand, with new partnerships and developments driving long-term demand. Floki Inu‚Äôs marketing campaigns and strong community backing have also helped it maintain a top position among meme cryptos. Why did this coin make it to this list? Floki Inu‚Äôs mix of meme culture and real-world utility keeps it relevant for investors looking for the best cryptos to hold long term. Brett: The Meme Coin That‚Äôs Taking Over Base Chain Brett ($BRETT) is quickly becoming one of the strongest meme coins on the Base Chain. Inspired by the character from Matt Furie‚Äôs Boys‚Äô Club, Brett has built an active and engaged community, making it a serious contender in the meme coin space. Since its launch, Brett has shown strong growth, and its connection to the Base Chain ecosystem has given it even more traction. With more investors joining daily, Brett‚Äôs momentum doesn‚Äôt seem to be slowing down anytime soon. Why did this coin make it to this list? Brett‚Äôs deep cultural roots and strong community backing make it a solid meme coin for long-term holding. Peanut the Squirrel: A Meme Coin With an Internet Icon Sometimes, the best meme coins come from unexpected sources, and Peanut the Squirrel (PNUT) is a perfect example. Inspired by a real-life social media-famous squirrel, this Solana-based token has built a loyal following among crypto and meme lovers alike. Peanut‚Äôs viral appeal, combined with Solana‚Äôs growing ecosystem, makes it a meme coin with serious potential. The community-driven nature of PNUT ensures that it stays relevant and continues to expand as more investors jump in. Why did this coin make it to this list? Peanut the Squirrel‚Äôs unique backstory and Solana support give it strong long-term appeal, making it one of the best cryptos to hold long term. The Bottom Line The meme coin market is thriving, and these four projects are at the center of the action. BTFD Coin‚Äôs presale is nearing its final stages, and with a $0.006 moon target and 3,650% ROI potential, it‚Äôs one of the most talked-about investments right now. Meanwhile, Floki Inu, Brett, and Peanut the Squirrel continue to capture investor interest with their expanding ecosystems and strong communities. If you‚Äôre looking for the best cryptos to hold long term, don‚Äôt wait until it‚Äôs too late. BTFD Coin‚Äôs presale won‚Äôt last forever, and now is the time to secure your position before the next price jump. Join the BTFD Coin presale today before the window closes.

This testnet isn‚Äôt a generic trial run ‚Äì it‚Äôs a full-featured preview of DeriW‚Äôs high-performance, user-centric platform, designed to demonstrate concrete improvements in usability, speed, and security. Early users and developers can now experience lightning-fast trades, up to 100x leverage, and robust security measures in a realistic environment as DeriW prepares to challenge industry incumbents. A Closer Look at the Testnet: Usability, Performance & Security DeriW‚Äôs testnet is engineered to feel like a production-ready exchange. Usability is key: traders can quickly connect their self-custody wallets and begin trading cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum with up to 100x leverage and a low 0.02% transaction fee. The platform offers multiple order types (market, limit, take-profit, stop-loss) and a diverse selection of tokens, from major assets to emerging projects. With its zero gas fee model, DeriW eliminates blockchain transaction costs, enabling rapid order placement and frictionless trading‚Äîcomparable to centralized exchanges. On the performance front, the DeriW testnet showcases the platform‚Äôs cutting-edge infrastructure. Built on the Arbitrum Orbit Layer 3 network (DeriW Chain), it leverages optimistic rollup technology and a custom WASM/Geth-based architecture. In practical terms, this translates to extremely high throughput and low latency. With a capacity of up to 80,000 transactions per second, testnet traders can execute orders smoothly with minimal latency, ensuring the platform stays responsive even during intense trading activity. Security measures are woven deeply into the testnet‚Äôs design, reflecting DeriW‚Äôs priority on protecting users. By building on Arbitrum‚Äôs L3, DeriW inherits Ethereum‚Äôs battle-tested security properties and decentralization while adding its own enhancements. All trades and collateral remain on-chain under users‚Äô self-custody, eliminating the custodial risks found in centralized exchanges. To further harden the platform, DeriW launched a comprehensive bug bounty program in tandem with the testnet. Security researchers and users are incentivized with bounties ranging from 100 to 100,000 $DER tokens for identifying vulnerabilities. Additionally, the testnet operates with a closed-fund liquidity mechanism and an automatic risk recalibration system that ensure stability even under extreme market conditions. These concrete measures give testnet participants confidence that the platform‚Äôs performance comes without compromising safety. How DeriW Stacks Up In an increasingly competitive DeFi derivatives arena, DeriW‚Äôs testnet is already demonstrating unique advantages over other leading platforms‚Äô test networks: Gas Fees & Trading Costs: DeriW distinguishes itself with its zero gas fee model. Every trade on DeriW‚Äôs testnet is executed without on-chain transaction fees, which is a stark contrast to many competitors. DeriW‚Äôs approach of truly on-chain, gas-free trading gives it an edge in user experience ‚Äì traders get the convenience of a CEX-like feel without sacrificing on-chain transparency. Performance Throughput: When it comes to raw speed, DeriW sets a high bar, delivering up to ~80,000 TPS‚Äîexceptional among decentralized exchanges. In comparison, some newer standalone-chain DEXs offer around 10,000 TPS‚Äîbetter than legacy Ethereum-based platforms but only an eighth of DeriW‚Äôs capability. This firmly places DeriW among elite, next-generation exchanges that support high-frequency trading at scale. Notably, DeriW achieves this impressive throughput while remaining fully EVM-compatible and secured by Ethereum, powered by the Arbitrum Orbit framework‚Äîa key differentiator validated by real user conditions on its testnet. Leverage and Trading Features: High leverage is a hallmark of derivative exchanges, and DeriW doesn‚Äôt disappoint. It offers up to 100x leverage on major trading pairs, which is higher than most decentralized competitors. By providing 100x, DeriW is catering to a segment of traders who seek higher risk-reward profiles, similar to offerings on some centralized futures exchanges. Importantly, DeriW couples this with advanced order types (stop-loss, take-profit, etc.) on the testnet, ensuring traders have tools to manage the risk that comes with high leverage. This combination of flexibility and control is critical ‚Äì and DeriW is showing that even in a testnet environment, users can practice sophisticated trading strategies that rival those on established platforms. Liquidity Model & Price Execution: Perhaps the most innovative aspect differentiating DeriW is its Pendulum AMM liquidity pool. Unlike traditional order books or static AMMs with oracles, DeriW‚Äôs pool dynamically adjusts liquidity based on traders‚Äô positions. This ‚Äúpendulum‚Äù approach optimizes asset utilization in real-time, supporting volumes beyond initial capital, reducing slippage, and providing deeper liquidity. While orderbook-based DEXs rely on market makers‚Äîvulnerable to slippage during volatility‚ÄîDeriW‚Äôs closed-fund model and automatic risk recalibration ensure solvency and stability, combining order-book depth with AMM efficiency. Security and Decentralization: All leading DeFi derivatives platforms prioritize security but use different approaches. Some rely on decentralized validators, others utilize their own consensus mechanisms with federated validators, and another inherits security from Arbitrum Layer 2. DeriW leverages Ethereum‚Äôs robust security via Arbitrum‚Äôs rollup, enhanced by its unique UBPK (Unstolen Browser Private Key) mechanism that ensures private keys remain securely stored within user browsers. Benchmarks and Performance Metrics in Context Thanks to Arbitrum Orbit‚Äôs efficient consensus and block production, DeriW‚Äôs block time is expected to be on the order of a second or less, which is similar to other DEXs 0.2s block time advantage. Achieving near-instant finality is crucial for traders who might otherwise worry about timing and MEV (Maximal Extractable Value) issues. Although detailed latency stats are still being gathered, the user experience goal is clear : make on-chain trading on DeriW feel as immediate as trading on a centralized platform. Another important metric is uptime and reliability during the test. The DeriW team is closely monitoring system uptime and recovery from any crashes or network issues. A robust exchange must handle network spikes, degraded conditions, or attacks without downtime. By publishing these performance metrics and comparing them with industry standards, DeriW intends to demonstrate transparently where it stands. So far, the absence of gas fees and high throughput capacity on testnet have enabled continuous trading even when simulating thousands of concurrent users ‚Äì something that might clog less scalable testnets. The platform is also tracking how its automatic risk controls (like the pendulum mechanism) perform quantitatively: e.g., maintaining targeted liquidity levels, keeping slippage near zero, and ensuring the funding rates and PnL (profit and loss) for liquidity providers stay within expected bounds. These technical benchmarks, once validated on testnet, will serve as proof points that DeriW can handle real-world volumes and stress when it goes live. Expected Outcomes & Next Steps Before Mainnet Launch The testnet phase is not just a demo for DeriW ‚Äì it‚Äôs a critical period for learning and refining. The main goals include collecting user feedback on the trading interface and features, uncovering any bugs or security vulnerabilities, and optimizing the platform‚Äôs performance under realistic conditions. DeriW is actively analyzing user interactions with its new liquidity model (including preferred leverage levels, popular trading pairs, and responses to zero fees) to refine fee structures and risk management. Incentive initiatives, such as the Supernova event, serve both as promotional tools and practical stress tests to ensure the platform performs reliably under high trading volume. Feedback collected through community channels will directly guide improvements, prioritizing user-identified issues in ongoing development sprints. By Q2 2025, DeriW plans to transition from testnet to mainnet alongside the $DER Token Generation Event (TGE), officially launching its economic and governance models. Prior to mainnet launch, the team will thoroughly fine-tune smart contracts, bolster infrastructure, and enhance the user interface based on insights gained from testnet users. The roadmap beyond mainnet is ambitious: by Q3 2025, DeriW plans to introduce a professional-grade API for algorithmic traders and support custom trading pairs. By Q4 2025, the goal is to cultivate a global trading community and further improve the user experience through community-driven enhancements‚Äîall built upon the foundation established during the testnet. Engaging the Community and Conclusion DeriW actively keeps the community engaged and informed with regular testnet updates, transparent performance metrics, and ongoing social media interaction. Early testnet adopters gain not only rewards but also valuable firsthand experience, positioning them advantageously for the mainnet launch. Backed by the seasoned CoinW exchange group, the meticulous approach to this testnet demonstrates readiness for prime time. DeriW‚Äôs testnet isn‚Äôt just another generic launch‚Äîit‚Äôs a bold demonstration of innovation, combining proven DeFi strengths with fresh enhancements. By benchmarking against industry leaders, DeriW signals its ambition to lead in decentralized trading. The coming months will be critical, but current progress suggests DeriW is well-positioned to convert testnet success into a transformative mainnet launch. Users can stay tuned as DeriW moves from testnet to mainnet, carrying forward the insights and confidence gained during this trial by fire. About DeriW DeriW is the first zero-gas-fee decentralized perpetual contract exchange, blending Ethereum‚Äôs security with Layer 3 scalability to deliver CEX-like efficiency in a decentralized framework. Operated by CoinW‚Äôs seasoned fintech team, it redefines trading with 80,000 TPS throughput, ensuring speed, transparency, and trustless execution.

Have you been feeling the tension in the air? Well, there‚Äôs a glimmer of hope on the horizon! The widely-watched Crypto Fear & Greed Index is flashing a less fearful signal, indicating a potential change in investor sentiment. Let‚Äôs dive into what this means for the crypto world and what you should be watching. Decoding the Crypto Fear and Greed Index: What‚Äôs Behind the Numbers? The Crypto Fear and Greed Index , a valuable tool provided by Alternative.me, isn‚Äôt just a random number generator. It‚Äôs a carefully calculated metric designed to gauge the prevailing emotions in the cryptocurrency market. Think of it as a mood ring for crypto! As of March 13th, the index climbed to 45, a significant 11-point leap from the previous day. This jump is noteworthy, but it‚Äôs crucial to understand what this number actually represents. The index operates on a scale from 0 to 100, with: 0 ‚Äì 24: Extreme Fear ‚Äì This zone suggests investors are extremely worried, potentially leading to panic selling and market bottoms. 25 ‚Äì 49: Fear ‚Äì Fear still dominates, indicating caution and uncertainty among traders. 50 ‚Äì 74: Greed ‚Äì Greed starts to creep in, with investors becoming more optimistic and potentially driving prices up. 75 ‚Äì 100: Extreme Greed ‚Äì This zone signals excessive optimism, often associated with market tops and potential bubbles. Currently at 45, the index remains in the ‚ÄúFear‚Äù zone. While still indicating overall fear, the significant increase suggests a lessening of extreme negativity and a move towards a more neutral market sentiment . What Factors Drive the Crypto Fear & Greed Index? The Crypto Fear and Greed Index isn‚Äôt based on guesswork. It‚Äôs a composite index, meaning it takes into account a range of data points to paint a holistic picture of market emotions. Here‚Äôs a breakdown of the factors influencing the index: Volatility (25%): Measures the rapidness and magnitude of price changes in the crypto market. High volatility often breeds fear.

Investor Confidence: Improved sentiment can encourage sidelined investors to re-enter the market, injecting new capital. Sustainable Growth: Growth driven by optimism rather than panic buying is generally considered more sustainable in the long run. Altcoin Performance: Often, when Bitcoin‚Äôs sentiment improves, altcoins tend to follow, potentially leading to broader market gains. However, it‚Äôs essential to remember that the index is just one tool. It‚Äôs not a crystal ball predicting future prices. It‚Äôs more like a weather vane, showing which way the wind of market emotion is currently blowing. A reading of 45, while improved, still suggests caution is warranted. Bitcoin Fear and Greed Index: Is Bitcoin Leading the Charge? While the article refers to the general Crypto Fear and Greed Index , it‚Äôs worth noting that there are also Bitcoin-specific Fear and Greed Indices available. Since Bitcoin is the dominant cryptocurrency, its sentiment heavily influences the overall market. Therefore, tracking the Bitcoin Fear and Greed Index specifically can offer even deeper insights into market movements. A rise in the general index often correlates with improved sentiment surrounding Bitcoin, and vice-versa. Actionable Insights: What Should Crypto Investors Do? So, what should you take away from this improved crypto market analysis ? Don‚Äôt Get Carried Away: While the increase is positive, the index is still in ‚ÄúFear.‚Äù Remain cautious and avoid impulsive decisions based solely on this indicator. Do Your Own Research (DYOR): The Fear & Greed Index is one data point. Combine it with fundamental analysis, technical analysis, and news monitoring for a well-rounded view.

The large-cap altcoin, with a fully diluted valuation of about $224 billion and a 24-hour average trading volume of $25 billion, has dropped more than 54 percent since December 2024. Ethereum Whales Cash Out The Ethereum network has experienced a huge cash outflow in the past few weeks amid leadership change from the Ethereum Foundation . The U.S. spot Ether ETFs have recorded a net cash outflow of nearly $200 million in the past three weeks. Interestingly, even BlackRock‚Äôs ETHA has been bleeding, whereby it recorded a net cash outflow of $11 million on Tuesday. According to on-chain data analytics from Coinglass, the Bitcoin miner reserves have been declining exponentially in the past years to hover about 1.92 million. Meanwhile, the overall supply of Ether on centralized exchanges increased by about 81,397 ETH units in the past 24 hours to about 15.01 million coins. Heavy Liquidation of ETH Whale at Hyperliquid Exchange Earlier on Wednesday, an Ether whale opened a long position of 175,179 ETH, worth about $335.6 million, with 50x leverage on the Hyperliquid trading platform. According to on-chain data , the whale investor actively closed 14,945 ETH positions, worth about $28.7 million. As a result, the whale investors left 160,234 ETH, worth around $306.8 million, to be liquidated, hence making a profit of $1.86M, which caused Hyperliquidity Provider(HLP) to lose $4 million in the past 24 hours. The notable loss on Hyperliquid raised alarm over the impact of high leverage causing liquidity drain. Furthermore, the entrance of a couple of similar traders could easily drain the liquidity for Hyperliquid pools. In response, Hyperliquid announced the reduction of Bitcoin and Ether leverage from 50x to 40x and 25x respectively. Regarding commentary and questions on the 0xf3f4 user's ETH long: To be clear: There was no protocol exploit or hack.

41574229,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=139696,1741843504,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Groundbreaking Bitcoin Bill: Senator Lummis Champions Strategic Reserve in US Congress,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/lummis-bitcoin-bill-strategic-reserve/,"Hold onto your hats, crypto enthusiasts! A potentially seismic shift is brewing in the U.S. political landscape, and it involves none other than Bitcoin. Wyoming Senator Cynthia Lummis, a known Bitcoin advocate, has just dropped a bombshell ‚Äì a bill aimed at establishing a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve for the United States. This isn‚Äôt just another crypto discussion; it‚Äôs a concrete proposal lodged right on the official Congress website, signaling a serious move towards integrating Bitcoin into the nation‚Äôs financial strategy. Let‚Äôs dive into the details of this fascinating development and explore what it could mean for the future of Bitcoin and the U.S. economy. What is Senator Lummis‚Äô Bold Bitcoin Bill Proposing? At its core, the bill introduced by Senator Cynthia Lummis is about more than just buying Bitcoin. It‚Äôs about strategically managing digital assets within the government framework. The central idea revolves around creating a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve , much like the nation maintains reserves of other critical assets. According to the details available on the Congress website and a press release from Senator Lummis‚Äô office dated March 11, the bill has a few key objectives: Transparency in Government Bitcoin Holdings: The bill emphasizes the need for clear and transparent management of any Bitcoin acquired by the U.S. government. This is crucial for accountability and public trust, especially in the nascent and often misunderstood world of cryptocurrency. Cost Efficiency Leveraging Federal Reserve Resources: A notable aspect is the intention to utilize resources from the Federal Reserve System to manage this Strategic Bitcoin Reserve . This approach aims to minimize additional costs and integrate Bitcoin management into existing financial infrastructure. Significant Bitcoin Acquisition: Perhaps the most eye-catching element is the proposal to implement a program to purchase 1 million units of Bitcoin. Senator Lummis‚Äô press release specifies that this acquisition would be spread out over a defined period to reach approximately 5% of the total Bitcoin supply. This is a substantial amount and would position the U.S. government as a significant holder of Bitcoin. In essence, this Bitcoin bill is a comprehensive approach to not just own Bitcoin, but to strategically incorporate it into the national financial framework with an eye on transparency and fiscal responsibility. Why a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve? Unpacking the Potential Benefits Why would the U.S. government consider establishing a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve ? The rationale likely stems from a mix of strategic foresight and recognizing the evolving financial landscape. Here are some potential benefits: Future-Proofing National Assets: Bitcoin, despite its volatility, is increasingly seen as a digital gold and a hedge against inflation by many. Holding a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve could be viewed as a way to diversify national assets and prepare for a future where digital currencies play a more prominent role in the global economy. Technological Leadership: Embracing Bitcoin could position the U.S. as a leader in the digital asset space. It sends a powerful signal globally about the nation‚Äôs willingness to innovate and adapt to technological advancements in finance. Potential Financial Gains: While not guaranteed, Bitcoin‚Äôs historical price appreciation suggests that a significant holding could lead to substantial financial gains for the government over the long term. This could offset costs and potentially generate revenue. National Security Implications: In a world where digital assets are becoming increasingly relevant, having a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve could also be seen as a matter of national security. It provides a foothold in this emerging asset class and ensures the U.S. is not left behind as other nations explore digital currencies. Senator Lummis, a vocal proponent of Bitcoin, likely sees this Bitcoin bill as a crucial step towards embracing the future of finance and ensuring the U.S. remains competitive and resilient in the digital age. Challenges and Considerations: Navigating the Road Ahead While the potential benefits of a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve are compelling, the path forward is not without its challenges and considerations: Challenge Description Market Volatility: Bitcoin‚Äôs price is notoriously volatile. A significant investment could be subject to substantial fluctuations, raising concerns about risk management and potential losses of public funds. Regulatory Uncertainty: The regulatory landscape for cryptocurrencies in the U.S. is still evolving. Clarity and consistent regulations are needed to effectively manage and oversee a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve . Operational Complexity: Managing a large Bitcoin reserve securely and efficiently requires specialized expertise and infrastructure. The Federal Reserve would need to develop or acquire these capabilities. Public Perception and Political Will: Convincing the public and garnering political support for investing in Bitcoin, especially given its volatility and association with speculation, could be an uphill battle. Security Risks: Custody and security of a large Bitcoin reserve are paramount. Safeguarding against theft, hacking, and loss requires robust security protocols and infrastructure. Addressing these challenges will be crucial for the successful implementation of the Bitcoin bill and the establishment of a truly effective Strategic Bitcoin Reserve . Examples from Around the Globe: Are Other Nations Considering Bitcoin Reserves? The idea of a national Strategic Bitcoin Reserve might seem novel to some, but the concept of nations embracing Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies is gaining traction globally. While no nation has yet officially declared a ‚ÄòStrategic Bitcoin Reserve‚Äô in the exact same terms as Senator Lummis‚Äô bill, several countries are taking significant steps in the Bitcoin and cryptocurrency space: El Salvador: Perhaps the most prominent example is El Salvador, which adopted Bitcoin as legal tender in 2021 and has been actively accumulating Bitcoin for its national reserves. While their approach differs, it showcases a nation-state directly incorporating Bitcoin into its financial strategy. Central African Republic: Following El Salvador, the Central African Republic also adopted Bitcoin as legal tender, signaling a growing interest in digital currencies among nations, particularly in regions seeking alternative financial systems. Switzerland and Crypto-Friendly Regions: While not building explicit Bitcoin reserves, Switzerland and certain regions within other countries have adopted highly crypto-friendly regulations and are becoming hubs for crypto innovation. This indirectly strengthens the ecosystem and validates the asset class. Growing Institutional Adoption: Globally, we are seeing increasing institutional adoption of Bitcoin by corporations and investment funds. This trend indicates a growing acceptance of Bitcoin as a legitimate asset and a store of value, potentially paving the way for more nations to consider similar strategic moves. These examples, while varied, demonstrate a global trend of exploring and integrating Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies into national and institutional frameworks. Senator Lummis‚Äô Bitcoin bill could position the U.S. at the forefront of this evolving landscape. Actionable Insights: What Does This Mean for You and the Crypto Market? So, what are the actionable takeaways from this groundbreaking Bitcoin bill and the proposal for a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve ? Increased Legitimacy for Bitcoin: The introduction of this bill by a U.S. Senator on the official Congress website significantly enhances the legitimacy of Bitcoin as an asset class. It signals that Bitcoin is being taken seriously at the highest levels of government. Potential Positive Market Impact: If the bill progresses and the U.S. government begins acquiring Bitcoin, it could create significant buying pressure in the market, potentially driving up prices. The proposed purchase of 1 million Bitcoin units is a substantial amount that could have a noticeable impact. Watch Regulatory Developments: Keep a close eye on the regulatory discussions and developments surrounding this bill. The way the U.S. government approaches regulating and managing Bitcoin will have far-reaching implications for the entire crypto industry. Long-Term Investment Signal: For long-term crypto investors, this bill could be seen as a positive signal. It suggests that despite short-term volatility, the long-term trajectory of Bitcoin and digital assets is towards greater adoption and integration into the mainstream financial system. Ultimately, Senator Lummis‚Äô Bitcoin bill is more than just a piece of legislation; it‚Äôs a statement. It reflects a growing recognition of Bitcoin‚Äôs potential and the need for governments to engage with and strategically incorporate digital assets into their financial planning. Conclusion: A Revolutionary Step or a Distant Dream? Senator Cynthia Lummis‚Äô Bitcoin bill proposing a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve is undoubtedly a significant development in the ongoing saga of cryptocurrency adoption. Whether it will become law remains to be seen, but its very existence signals a paradigm shift in how policymakers are beginning to view Bitcoin. It‚Äôs a bold, forward-thinking proposal that, if implemented, could have profound implications for the U.S. economy, the global financial landscape, and the future of Bitcoin itself. The journey of this bill through Congress will be closely watched by crypto enthusiasts, economists, and policymakers alike, as it could very well pave the way for a new era of digital asset integration into national financial strategies. This is a space to watch closely ‚Äì the future of finance is unfolding before our eyes.

The agency recently postponed its ruling on whether Cboe BZX can list options on Fidelity‚Äôs Ether ETF, pushing the deadline to May 14. Meanwhile, asset manager Franklin Templeton has filed for a Solana ETF with Cboe BZX, proposing that the fund be allowed to stake its SOL holdings for additional rewards. SEC Delays Decision on Cboe BZX‚Äôs Request to List Options on Fidelity‚Äôs Ether ETF The US SEC has postponed its ruling on whether the Cboe BZX Exchange can list options tied to Fidelity‚Äôs Ethereum exchange-traded fund (ETF). According to a March 12 SEC filing , the regulatory body has extended its decision deadline to May 14, giving itself additional time to review the proposal. The delay marks yet another instance of the SEC exercising caution in the evolving cryptocurrency investment landscape. While the introduction of options on Ether ETFs would represent a major milestone in integrating digital assets into traditional financial markets, regulatory uncertainty continues to loom over such innovations. Cboe BZX initially submitted its request to list options on Fidelity‚Äôs Ether ETF (FETH) in January. If approved, this move could significantly enhance liquidity and institutional engagement in the Ethereum market by allowing sophisticated investors to hedge their positions and employ advanced trading strategies. Options trading plays a crucial role in the traditional financial ecosystem, providing traders with flexibility in managing risk and leveraging market movements. By extending this mechanism to Ether ETFs, institutional investors could gain a new level of exposure to Ethereum while mitigating potential downside risks. Fidelity‚Äôs FETH currently holds approximately $780 million in net assets, making it one of the leading Ether ETFs in the market. As institutional interest in Ethereum continues to grow, the ability to trade options on such funds would further cement Ether‚Äôs position as a mainstream financial asset. The SEC‚Äôs latest delay comes against the backdrop of a wave of cryptocurrency ETF-related filings in recent months. In February, the agency acknowledged over a dozen exchange filings for various crypto-related ETFs. This increased engagement suggests a possible shift in the regulatory approach to digital assets under the new administration of US President Donald Trump, who assumed office for his second term on Jan. 20. While the SEC has long been cautious in its handling of cryptocurrency-related financial products, the acknowledgment of these filings indicates a gradual opening toward more crypto-friendly regulations. Market analysts speculate that the current wave of delays could be a sign that the SEC is carefully assessing the broader impact of approving options trading on Ether ETFs. Beyond the options listing, Cboe BZX made another groundbreaking request on March 11, asking the SEC for permission to incorporate Ethereum staking into Fidelity‚Äôs Ether ETF. If approved, this would mark the first instance of a publicly traded US Ether fund allowing staking‚Äîa mechanism that enables investors to earn rewards by locking up their ETH with validators on the Ethereum network. Staking has become an increasingly popular way to generate passive income within the crypto ecosystem. However, concerns over regulatory scrutiny have prevented major US-based crypto ETFs from integrating staking rewards into their offerings. The SEC‚Äôs stance on staking remains unclear, with the agency previously cracking down on certain staking services provided by centralized exchanges like Kraken. Approval of staking within an Ether ETF would be a major development, as it could enhance returns for investors and make these funds even more attractive compared to traditional investment vehicles. Competition Heats Up Among Ethereum ETFs While Fidelity‚Äôs FETH remains one of the more prominent Ether ETFs, BlackRock‚Äôs iShares Ethereum Trust (ETHA) leads the market with more than $3.7 billion in net assets, according to VettaFi data. The SEC is set to decide by April whether Nasdaq can list options tied to ETHA, a decision that could set a precedent for future approvals, including Fidelity‚Äôs bid. Ethereum ETFs have gained significant traction since their launch in July 2024, collectively amassing nearly $7 billion in net assets. Their growing adoption suggests increasing institutional confidence in Ethereum as a long-term asset class. With multiple filings under review, the SEC‚Äôs upcoming decisions could have profound implications for the cryptocurrency market. The agency has set an April deadline to rule on Nasdaq‚Äôs request to list options on BlackRock‚Äôs ETHA, while Cboe‚Äôs request to list options on Fidelity‚Äôs FETH will be addressed by May. If approved, options trading on Ether ETFs could open the floodgates for even greater institutional participation, further legitimizing Ethereum as an investable asset. However, the SEC‚Äôs history of delays and cautious approach suggests that regulatory approval is far from guaranteed. Cboe Files for Franklin Templeton‚Äôs Solana ETF Amid Growing Institutional Interest in Crypto In other ETF news, the Chicago Board Options BZX Exchange (Cboe) has officially submitted an application on behalf of asset management giant Franklin Templeton to list a Solana (SOL) exchange-traded fund (ETF) in the United States. According to a March 12 filing , Franklin Templeton‚Äôs proposed ETF will hold spot Solana, with an additional request to allow staking. The filing emphasized the importance of staking, likening it to traditional equity funds collecting dividends. The proposed Franklin Templeton Solana ETF aligns with the increasing trend of institutional interest in Solana, a blockchain network that has gained significant traction for its high-speed, low-cost transactions and growing decentralized finance (DeFi) and NFT ecosystems. The filing made a strong case for allowing staking, arguing that barring the ETF from staking its SOL would be equivalent to refusing dividends from stocks held in an equity-based exchange-traded product (ETP). Franklin Templeton‚Äôs foray into Solana follows its registration of a Solana trust on Feb. 10, joining major asset managers such as Grayscale, Bitwise, VanEck, 21Shares, and Canary Capital‚Äîall of whom have submitted applications to launch Solana investment products. Despite this momentum, regulatory approval remains uncertain. The SEC has historically taken a cautious approach to crypto-based financial products, often delaying or rejecting applications due to concerns over market manipulation, volatility, and investor protection. Solana‚Äôs inclusion in Franklin Templeton‚Äôs ETF filing is particularly noteworthy given its brief mention in the early crypto stockpile discussions by the Trump administration. Before scaling back to include only tokens seized through enforcement actions, President Trump initially named Solana among the assets considered for inclusion in the US government's digital holdings. This initial recognition by the administration, combined with Franklin Templeton‚Äôs growing involvement in the crypto sector, suggests a potential shift in how US regulators might view Solana as an institutional-grade investment asset. While the Franklin Templeton Solana ETF filing marks a significant milestone, it arrives amid continued regulatory delays on crypto-based investment products. The SEC, now operating under new leadership following former Chair Gary Gensler‚Äôs resignation in January 2025, recently announced that it would delay decisions on several altcoin ETF applications. This postponement reflects the regulator‚Äôs cautious stance as it evaluates whether approving ETFs for alternative cryptocurrencies aligns with its investor protection mandate. However, Bloomberg ETF analyst James Seyffart pointed out that such delays are standard procedure and do not necessarily indicate a lower probability of approval. Seyffart emphasized that the final deadline for these altcoin ETFs is not until October 2025, leaving ample time for regulatory assessments and potential adjustments. Franklin Templeton CEO Optimistic About Crypto Integration Franklin Templeton‚Äôs CEO, Jenny Johnson, remains optimistic about the evolving regulatory landscape under the Trump administration. In a Jan. 21 interview with Bloomberg, Johnson expressed confidence in a pro-crypto agenda that could lead to the deeper integration of traditional finance with blockchain technology. ‚ÄúI do think that it‚Äôs likely that ETFs and mutual funds will ultimately be built on blockchain just because it‚Äôs an incredibly efficient technology,‚Äù Johnson said. Her comments are part of the broader industry sentiment that blockchain could revolutionize traditional financial products, offering increased transparency, reduced settlement times, and enhanced security. If approved, Franklin Templeton‚Äôs Solana ETF would provide traditional investors with regulated exposure to SOL without the need for direct ownership or private key management. The additional request to incorporate staking could further enhance investor returns, making the ETF an attractive option for both retail and institutional investors. While the SEC‚Äôs regulatory timeline remains uncertain, the increasing number of filings for Solana-based investment products signals growing confidence in the blockchain‚Äôs long-term viability. Institutional interest continues to rise, and with market heavyweights like Franklin Templeton backing Solana, it may only be a matter of time before SOL joins Bitcoin and Ethereum in the ranks of fully regulated investment vehicles.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,REGULATION|SOL|ETH|BUSINESS|MARKET,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-03-13 05:30:00

Everyone knows this, which is why BTC remains the top player in the market to this day. However, with great power also comes great responsibility, or in this case ‚Äì a huge market cap. Since BTC is as large as it is, it doesn‚Äôt have much room for growth, at least not in the short term. Because of this, Bitcoin holders are investing heavily in FXGuys ($FXG), as this new project has virtually unlimited room for growth and great potential. It brings a great new crypto trading platform to the market, one that will help traders make money in all market conditions, even now! >>>JOIN FXGUYS HERE BTC‚Äôs Price Falls as Bitcoin Whales Take Profit It takes a lot for BTC‚Äôs price to move. This can be seen through a new BTC-related development. Namely, in the last two weeks 4,375 new wallets holding over 1 BTC token have been created . Even though this is quite a sizable lot, it still didn‚Äôt really move the Bitcoin price. However, Bitcoin whales taking profits did. Bitcoin whales recently realized over $80 million in profits, selling their BTC tokens as they did. Now this did affect the BTC price, as it fell by around 2% shortly after. BTC‚Äôs price is now at $88,268, but due to Trump adding BTC to the upcoming U.S. Crypto Reserve, Bitcoin‚Äôs price is 4.83% higher than it was 7 days ago. So, it‚Äôs clear that BTC‚Äôs price movements are a bit uncertain right now, which is mostly because of the current overly bearish crypto market. Experts aren‚Äôt sure where the Bitcoin price will go by year-end, as an extended bearish market could cause the BTC price to plunge below $80,000 soon. However, if bulls take over, then BTC‚Äôs price could cross $100,000 again this year. Thus, they recommend patience to all Bitcoin holders, and that‚Äôs what they‚Äôre getting. Namely, many Bitcoin holders are now flocking to FXGuys while they wait for the uncertainty surrounding BTC to die down. Also, they‚Äôre investing in this new crypto trading platform as it offers much more potential than Bitcoin does right now!

While Ethereum grapples with uncertain demand and macro factors, Rollblock‚Äôs revenue-based casino model gains momentum, highlighting how user-focused innovation can prevail despite broader market headwinds. Rollblock‚Äôs Approach to Rewards and Transparency Rollblock (RBLK) positions itself as a next-generation casino platform where players benefit directly from the platform‚Äôs success. Up to 30% of weekly gaming revenue goes to RBLK token buybacks, ensuring steady demand. Beyond that, Rollblock emphasizes player engagement and loyalty, granting access to exclusive perks and governance votes for those who hold its token. This approach resonates with users seeking real value, not just short-term gains. A good example here is Crypto RJ, who highlighted Rollblock as the best crypto coin in the GambleFi sector. At a time when many crypto projects rely on hype or unproven utilities, Rollblock‚Äôs actual revenue distribution stands out. Its presale has already secured more than $10 million , with tokens currently at $0.061, reflecting robust interest. Why Ethereum Struggles with Market Sentiment Even with a storied history as the second-largest cryptocurrency, Ethereum ‚Äôs vulnerability has become more apparent. The ETH price recently tested deeper lows, stirring fears of a potential breakdown if psychological support cracks. Observers say a variety of factors, including macroeconomic uncertainties and occasional whale liquidations, weigh heavily on ETH ‚Äôs outlook. The Ethereum price monthly price trend. Source: CoinGecko Complicating matters further, Ethereum ‚Äôs evolving network upgrades can create mixed messages. While improvements like sharding or scaling solutions promise efficiency boosts, they also push the narrative that Ethereum is still a work in progress. The Role of a Potential Bull Run Amid these headwinds, some analysts believe the next bull run could rejuvenate Ethereum . Historically, ETH has surged during bullish phases, offering a glimpse of its transformative potential. If institutional capital inflows or more favorable regulations accelerate, Ethereum might reclaim a dominant role in DeFi and NFTs. Yet skepticism lingers. If the global environment remains risk-off, large investors might sideline crypto allocations or look for tokens that promise near-term returns. That scenario complicates a full-scale bull run for Ethereum , especially if macro indicators remain bearish. How Rollblock Differentiates Itself Rollblock ‚Äôs model hinges on revenue, not speculation. The platform‚Äôs buyback program helps stabilize RBLK, mitigating panic selling when sentiment wavers. This design is particularly appealing to investors wary of abrupt price swings that plague purely speculative coins. Moreover, RBLK‚Äôs straightforward premise‚Äîa profitable casino distributing part of its earnings‚Äîmakes it less reliant on unclear roadmaps or hype-driven narratives. While Ethereum focuses on broad ecosystems and decentralized applications, Rollblock solves a more direct problem: how to reward users from existing, consistent income. ETH vs. RBLK: Contrasting Investment Paths Ethereum ‚Äôs open structure and large ecosystem still attract developers and projects. It‚Äôs a cornerstone of decentralized finance, with a diverse user base. If a bull run arrives, ETH holders could see meaningful gains, assuming the project maintains its lead in innovation. Rollblock , however, appeals to those preferring steady, revenue-backed potential. Its smaller market cap leaves room for growth, and the built-in buyback system could stabilize or elevate its price, irrespective of broader market dips. That reliability stands in stark contrast to Ethereum ‚Äôs repeated volatility. Implications for 2025 With ETH approaching critical levels , many wonder if upcoming upgrades will reverse the downturn or if external issues will keep pressure on the ETH price . In parallel, Rollblock‚Äôs consistent performance hints at an alternative future for crypto, anchored in tangible returns rather than promises. While Ethereum tries to safeguard its longtime position, Rollblock‚Äôs presale success underscores the market‚Äôs appetite for clear value propositions. Should the industry see another surge, RBLK might well be at the forefront, riding real revenue metrics instead of purely speculative trades.

41574773,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=139712,1741844101,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Navigating Uncertainty: Asia FX Muted Amidst Tariff Tensions and Recession Whispers as Dollar Ascends Post-CPI,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/asia-fx-markets-tariff-recession/,"The Asian foreign exchange (FX) market is currently in a state of watchful waiting, a stillness that belies the powerful undercurrents shaping global finance. Imagine a calm sea, beautiful on the surface, yet hinting at the powerful storms brewing beneath. That‚Äôs a fitting analogy for Asia FX Markets right now. Traders are keenly observing the interplay of persistent trade tariffs, the ever-present specter of recession, and the recent strengthening of the US dollar following the latest Consumer Price Index (CPI) data release. For those involved in crypto or traditional finance, understanding these forex movements is crucial as they ripple across all markets, influencing investment strategies and risk assessments. Let‚Äôs dive into the factors creating this muted yet critical moment in Asia‚Äôs forex landscape. Why are Currency Tariffs Casting a Long Shadow on Asia FX? Tariffs, essentially taxes on imported goods, are more than just trade barriers; they are economic disruptors. For Asia, a region heavily reliant on international trade, especially with major economies like the United States and China, currency tariffs represent a significant headwind. Here‚Äôs why they are so impactful: Reduced Trade Volumes: Tariffs increase the cost of goods, making them less competitive in international markets. This can lead to a decrease in export volumes from Asian nations, directly impacting their trade balances and, consequently, their currencies. Supply Chain Disruptions: Global supply chains are intricately woven. Tariffs can unravel these chains, forcing businesses to rethink production locations, often leading to inefficiencies and increased costs. This uncertainty weighs heavily on investor sentiment and FX valuations. Currency Devaluation Pressure: To offset the negative impacts of tariffs, some countries might be tempted to devalue their currencies to make their exports cheaper. However, this can trigger a ‚Äòrace to the bottom‚Äô and lead to currency volatility, unsettling Asia FX Markets . Consider the ongoing trade tensions between major global players. These disputes, often manifested through tariff impositions, create a climate of uncertainty. Businesses become hesitant to invest, consumers may delay spending, and this collective caution reflects in the subdued movements of Asian currencies. It‚Äôs a domino effect where trade policy directly influences forex market behavior. Global Recession Fears : Are They Justified and How Do They Impact Asia FX? The ‚ÄòR‚Äô word ‚Äì Recession ‚Äì is increasingly being whispered in economic circles. Are these global recession fears justified, and how do they translate to the forex markets in Asia? Several factors are fueling these concerns: Inflationary Pressures: While inflation might be showing signs of cooling in some regions, it remains elevated in many parts of the world. Persistent high inflation erodes purchasing power and forces central banks to maintain or even increase interest rates, potentially slowing economic growth. Geopolitical Instability: Ongoing conflicts and geopolitical tensions add another layer of complexity. These events can disrupt energy supplies, increase commodity prices, and further fuel inflationary pressures, heightening recession risks. Slowing Global Growth: Major economies are showing signs of deceleration. China‚Äôs growth, while still robust compared to many nations, is facing headwinds. Europe is grappling with energy crises and the fallout from geopolitical events. A synchronized global slowdown inevitably impacts export-oriented economies in Asia. When recession fears escalate, investors typically flock to safe-haven assets. In the forex world, the US dollar often plays this role. As investors seek safety, demand for the dollar rises, strengthening it against other currencies, including those in Asia. This flight to safety contributes to the muted performance of Asia FX Markets during periods of heightened recession concerns. US Dollar Strength : Riding High Post-CPI ‚Äì What‚Äôs Next for Asia FX? The US dollar has demonstrated remarkable resilience, particularly after recent CPI data releases. But what exactly is driving this US Dollar Strength , and how does it influence Asian currencies? The latest CPI figures, while showing a slight moderation in inflation, still suggest that inflationary pressures are not completely tamed. This has led markets to anticipate that the Federal Reserve (Fed) will likely maintain its hawkish stance on interest rates. Higher interest rates make dollar-denominated assets more attractive to investors globally, increasing demand for the dollar. Here‚Äôs the impact of a strong dollar on Asia FX: Increased Import Costs: For Asian countries that import goods priced in US dollars (like commodities), a stronger dollar makes these imports more expensive in local currency terms. This can contribute to imported inflation. Debt Servicing Challenges: Many Asian nations hold dollar-denominated debt. A stronger dollar increases the cost of servicing this debt in local currency, potentially straining government finances and impacting economic stability. Competitive Pressures on Exports: A strong dollar can make Asian exports relatively more expensive compared to US goods in international markets, potentially hurting export competitiveness. The interplay between US Dollar Strength and Asia FX Markets is a critical dynamic to watch. If the dollar continues its upward trajectory, Asian currencies could face further downward pressure. Conversely, any signs of a weakening dollar could provide some breathing room for Asian FX. Decoding Inflation CPI Data : Is it a Friend or Foe to Asia FX? Inflation CPI data releases are pivotal moments for forex markets. The Consumer Price Index (CPI) measures the average change in prices paid by urban consumers for a basket of consumer goods and services. It‚Äôs a key indicator of inflation, and central banks closely monitor it to guide their monetary policy decisions. But is this data a friend or foe to Asia FX Markets ? The answer is nuanced and depends on the context: Higher-than-expected CPI: If CPI data comes in higher than anticipated, it typically strengthens the currency of the country releasing the data (in this case, the US dollar). This is because it signals potential for further interest rate hikes to combat inflation, making the currency more attractive to investors. For Asia FX Markets , this usually translates to downward pressure. Lower-than-expected CPI: Conversely, if CPI data is lower than expected, it can suggest that inflationary pressures are easing. This might lead to expectations of a less hawkish stance from the central bank, potentially weakening the currency. This could offer some relief to Asia FX Markets , allowing for potential appreciation. CPI Trends and Future Expectations: Beyond a single data point, the trend of CPI data is crucial. Is inflation consistently declining? Is it plateauing? Market reactions are heavily influenced by these trends and future expectations regarding inflation and central bank responses. For Asia FX Markets , understanding how to interpret Inflation CPI Data is essential. It‚Äôs not just about the immediate reaction but also about anticipating the longer-term implications for interest rates, economic growth, and currency valuations. Actionable Insights: Navigating the Current Forex Landscape So, what are the actionable takeaways from this complex interplay of tariffs, recession fears, dollar strength, and CPI data for those involved in crypto and traditional finance? Stay Informed: Keep a close watch on macroeconomic data releases, especially CPI, GDP growth figures, and trade policy announcements. These data points are crucial for understanding the direction of forex markets. Diversify your Portfolio: In times of uncertainty, diversification is key. Don‚Äôt overexpose yourself to a single currency or asset class. Consider a mix of assets, including cryptocurrencies, which can sometimes act as hedges against traditional market volatility. Risk Management is Paramount: Implement robust risk management strategies. Use stop-loss orders, manage your leverage, and be prepared for potential market swings. The current forex environment demands caution and preparedness. Understand Geopolitical Factors: Geopolitical events can have swift and significant impacts on forex markets. Stay informed about global political developments and their potential economic consequences. Seek Expert Advice: If you‚Äôre unsure how to navigate these complex market conditions, consider seeking advice from financial professionals. They can provide tailored guidance based on your risk tolerance and investment goals. Conclusion: A Muted Market with Powerful Potential for Change The current muted state of Asia FX Markets is not a sign of inactivity, but rather a reflection of the powerful, often conflicting forces at play. Currency Tariffs , global recession fears , US dollar strength driven by inflation CPI data ‚Äì these are all significant factors shaping the forex landscape. While the market might appear calm on the surface, beneath it lies a dynamic environment ripe with potential for significant shifts. By staying informed, understanding the key drivers, and implementing sound risk management strategies, investors can navigate this uncertainty and position themselves to capitalize on future opportunities in the ever-evolving world of forex and cryptocurrencies.

On-chain data from Arkham Intelligence confirms that these addresses, which have historically transferred SOL to major exchanges like Coinbase and Binance, now hold approximately $178.82 million in SOL. However, despite the substantial movement of funds, Solana‚Äôs price remains largely unaffected. FTX and Alameda‚Äôs Staking History Since the FTX collapse, Alameda has consistently shuffled large amounts of crypto assets. Since November 2023, FTX/Alameda has moved a staggering 7.845 million SOL‚Äîworth over $1 billion‚Äîto exchanges. Even after this latest unlock, their staking address still holds around 5.5 million SOL, valued at $693.8 million. The broader FTX reimbursement process has also led to the release of $1.57 billion worth of Solana tokens. Interestingly, previous Alameda asset movements‚Äîsuch as staking $10 million in MATIC or transferring $14.75 million in Ethereum‚Äîcaused noticeable price swings. Yet, despite today‚Äôs significant SOL unlock, the market reaction has been surprisingly muted. Why Didn‚Äôt Solana‚Äôs Price Move? Unlike previous movements, Solana‚Äôs price barely moved following Alameda‚Äôs $23 million unlock. Instead, SOL‚Äôs minor fluctuations happened before the transaction, driven by other market factors. In contrast, Ethereum jumped 10% when Alameda transferred a significantly smaller $14.75 million worth of ETH earlier this year. A possible reason for the lack of impact is the broader bearish sentiment in the crypto market. The SEC‚Äôs recent delay on multiple Solana ETF applications has added to the negative outlook, causing uncertainty. Meanwhile, Extreme Fear is gripping the market, leading to heavy outflows from major cryptocurrencies. What‚Äôs Next for Alameda‚Äôs Unlocked SOL? So far, Alameda has not disclosed how it plans to use the unstaked Solana tokens. One possibility is that these funds will be used for FTX creditor repayments, a process that began last month and is expected to take a long time. Given the scale of FTX‚Äôs outstanding obligations, however, even large token unlocks may not significantly shift Solana‚Äôs supply-demand balance. For now, Alameda‚Äôs latest move is just another chapter in the ongoing FTX saga. But with billions of dollars in SOL still in play, the market will be watching closely for its next steps.",News|Crypto news,EN,0,0,SOL|RESEARCH|MARKET|TRADING|ETH,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-03-13 05:36:50

The S&P 500, after reaching a record high on February 19, has since dropped more than 9%, with the Nasdaq Composite sinking 13%, according to data from CNBC. The US economy is now facing growing uncertainty because of that, and so investors are scrambling to reposition. Tech, airline, and bank stocks collapse as investors pull out Tech stocks that dominated the market have been slammed in the Wall Street sell off. Nvidia, which rode the AI hype, has tumbled by over 20% as investors worry about China‚Äôs expanding AI sector after the rise of DeepSeek. Tesla, which surged after President Donald Trump‚Äôs election victory, has crashed by 36%, erasing all of those gains as Elon Musk desperately tries to win back investors. Palantir, once flying high on US government contracts, has lost 30% after peaking last month amid Wall Street sell-off. Among the ‚ÄúMagnificent Seven‚Äù, Microsoft has held up the best but is still down 8%, the data shows. Airlines have also been hit hard, with Delta, American Airlines, and United Airlines all dropping by nearly 30% since the S&P 500 hit all-time highs back in December. Investors are reacting to warnings about lower demand and a possible slowdown in consumer spending. Banks are feeling the pressure of the Wall Street sell-off too. Citigroup, Morgan Stanley, and Goldman Sachs are all down 20% as recession fears increase and traders worry about slower corporate growth. The market‚Äôs shift away from risk is leaving banks in a tough spot. Goldman Sachs has cut its S&P 500 target, with David Kostin now expecting the index to rise 10% from current levels, instead of from 2024 levels. In an investor note sent on Tuesday, Kostin explained to investors that the ‚ÄúMagnificent Seven‚Äù accounted for more than half of the total correction, but he also warned that the market‚Äôs problems extend far beyond those stocks. Meanwhile, the Wall Street crash has also exposed how top-heavy the US market has become, as the equal-weighted S&P 500, which treats all stocks the same, is down by 6%, according to the CNBC data. Investors are now betting on defensive stocks But while others are tanking, defensive stocks are thriving, as American Water Works is up by 12%, and Merck & Co has climbed by 11%. US Steel and Nucor have also seen gains, benefiting from Trump‚Äôs latest trade threats, including a 50% tariff on Canadian steel imports. Some tech stocks that were previously ignored are holding up. Cisco and IBM, which have been left out of the AI boom, are only down by 6% since February and have managed to stay in positive territory for the year, according to data gotten from Google Finance. Small-cap stocks, which you‚Äôd expect to benefit from the tech sell-off as they have historically in the past and also surged after the election thanks to Trump‚Äôs promised tax cuts and deregulation to boost the economy, have instead crashed along with the Magnificent 7. Unlike last August, when small-caps rallied after a tech sell-off, this time they‚Äôre sinking alongside everything else. Also, the US stock market‚Äôs premium over European markets is shrinking. Years of outperformance made US stocks far more expensive than European ones, but the recent Wall Street drop has changed that. The S&P 500‚Äôs forward price-earnings ratio has fallen from 26x to 21x, while European stocks have only dropped from 15x to 14x, proving that investors who once saw Wall Street as the safest bet are now rethinking their positions, according to a note from Goldman Sachs on Tuesday. Consumer confidence has crashed, with February posting the biggest one-month drop since the pandemic, and though egg and gas prices have actually gone low, inflation concerns continue to haunt investors. Wall Street hedge funds like Citadel and Bridgewater are unwinding their positions. Moreover, bond markets are now pricing in three to four 25bp rate cuts this year, showing that Wall Street expects weaker economic growth ahead. While some analysts argue that a recession isn‚Äôt the ‚Äúbase case‚Äù yet, we‚Äôre pretty sure not everyone‚Äôs buying it. Trump himself admitted that he isn‚Äôt ruling out a recession for this year. Cryptopolitan Academy: Tired of market swings? Learn how DeFi can help you build steady passive income.

According to a Mar. 13 post on X by Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong, the launch of the U.S. Strategic Bitcoin Reserve has increased institutional interest in crypto. Coinbase aims to help governments securely trade, store, and use digital assets, encouraging more agencies to move on-chain. Armstrong also invited government institutions to reach out for crypto-related services. https://twitter.com/brian_armstrong/status/1899950474788471200?s=46&t=nznXkss3debX8JIhNzHmzw Coinbase has emerged as a preferred partner for government agencies because of its robust security and compliance structure.

Coinbase safeguards nearly 12% of the world‚Äôs crypto assets and is the custodian of choice for major financial institutions offering spot crypto exchange-traded funds, according to a blog post on their website. In response to the rising demand from institutions, Armstrong has hinted at plans to add 1,000 new staff members by 2025, citing increased regulatory clarity. Following his attendance of the White House crypto summit, he noted that the change in U.S. regulatory policy gives Coinbase greater confidence to make domestic investments. Meanwhile, on Mar. 13, Coinbase announced the delisting of Floki ( FLOKI ), TURBO, and GIGA for New York users. The company stated that after a routine review, these tokens no longer meet its listing standards. Trading for these assets will end on Apr.14 at around 2 PM ET.

The flagship coin pumped around 2 percent in the last 24 hours to trade about $83,282 on Thursday, March 13, during the early European session. As a result of the sudden pump, the fear of further crypto capitulation significantly declined. The Bitcoin fear and greed index jumped from 34 percent, denoting market fear, to around 45 percent, representing the neutrality of traders.

Currently, the 50-week MA is hovering around $75.5k whilst the 200-week MA is hovering around $46k. From a bullish perspective, Bitcoin price must consistently close above the resistance/support range between $92k and $95k to validate a rally beyond $109k. Furthermore, more than 1.2 million Bitcoin addresses, out of the 54 million on-chain holders, purchased 726k BTCs at around $95k. Reasons to Remain Bullish Ahead Bitcoin price will eventually follow gold price, which has rebounded towards its all-time high. Furthermore, the ongoing adoption of Bitcoin by nation-states, led by the United States, confirms the fact that BTC is digital gold. Meanwhile, the U.S. spot BTC ETFs ended a two-week losing streak with a $13.3 million cash inflow on Wednesday.

Dalbon submitted a request to prosecutor Eduardo Taiano and judge Mar√≠a Servini, who are probing President Javier Milei‚Äôs involvement in the memecoin , seeking for an Interpol Red Notice to be issued for Davis, local outlets P√°gina 12 and Perfil reported on March 11. Dalbon said in the filing that there was a ‚Äúprocedural risk‚Äù if Davis remained free as he could have access to vast amounts of money that would allow him to either flee the US or go into hiding. ‚ÄúHis central role in the creation and promotion of the $LIBRA cryptocurrency, coupled with the international impact of the case, increases the likelihood that he will take steps to evade justice,‚Äù the document reportedly stated. Dalbon, who represented former Argentine president Cristina Fern√°ndez de Kirchner in her corruption case, asked for Davis‚Äô arrest and for ‚Äúan Interpol red notice [to] be issued in order to locate and arrest him, with a view to his extradition.‚Äù Interpol is the biggest international police organization and can issue Red Notices that request law enforcement agencies around the world to locate and provisionally arrest someone. LIBRA is a token that Milei shared across his social media accounts just minutes after its creation on Feb. 14, which catapulted it to a peak value of over $4 billion. The token‚Äôs creators held most of the supply and quickly sold their holdings, which caused the token‚Äôs price to crash , with many claiming the token was a pump-and-dump scheme. Hayden Davis (left) poses with Argentine President Javier Milei. Source: Javier Milei Days later, various lawyers reportedly filed fraud charges against Milei in an Argentine criminal court for promoting the token, while other lawyers reported the president for financial crimes to local authorities and to the US Justice Department. Related: Memecoins are likely dead for now, but they‚Äôll be back: CoinGecko Milei has claimed he didn‚Äôt ‚Äúpromote‚Äù the LIBRA token and insisted he just ‚Äúspread the word‚Äù about it. In a lengthy interview days after LIBRA‚Äôs collapse with YouTuber Stephen Findeisen, better known as ‚ÄúCoffeezilla,‚Äù Davis defended the token as a failure rather than a scam. Davis and his firm, Kelsier Ventures, were the biggest winners from the LIBRA token launch. He claimed to Findeisen that he netted around $100 million but said he didn‚Äôt own the tokens and wouldn‚Äôt be selling them. It was later reported that he sent a text message bragging about being able to pay Milei‚Äôs sister, Karina Milei, to have the president share the memecoin‚Äôs details on X. Davis later said he had no record of this on his phone and denied making payments to the Mileis.

A recent trade on Hyperliquid‚Äôs HLP vault wiped out $4 million‚Äînot due to a bug or an exploit, but through a calculated move that exploited market mechanics. A trader turned $10 million USDC into a $271 million Ethereum long position, walked away with $1.8 million in profit, and left HLP to absorb the loss. It is considered as the biggest single day loss since its launch in May 2023. Crypto analyst Three Sigma is questioning whether protocols relying on liquidations are playing into the hands of savvy traders. One trader VS. Hyperliquid‚Äôs HLP vault. $4M gone. No bug. No exploit. Just a brutal game of liquidity mechanics. Here‚Äôs how they pulled it off. pic.twitter.com/ivkMBcwS2q ‚Äî Three Sigma (@threesigmaxyz) March 12, 2025 The Setup: A Trader‚Äôs Clever Play In simple terms, HLP is Hyperliquid‚Äôs liquidity pool , where users can deposit funds to passively earn from market-making and liquidations. It generally profits when traders lose, but automated strategies can sometimes be exploited. This happened when a trader withdrew collateral, forcing HLP to take over a bad trade, leading to a $4 million loss. Trading at massive size comes with a challenge‚Äîhow to exit a position without crashing the market. Instead of selling ETH directly into the order books, the trader played the system. They withdrew their collateral, reducing their margin and triggering a forced liquidation. This move offloaded their entire position onto Hyperliquid‚Äôs HLP vault, which took on the $286 million ETH long. Knowing that HLP‚Äôs forced selling would drive ETH prices lower , the trader had a hedge ready. By shorting ETH on another exchange‚Äîpotentially Binance‚Äîthey ensured profits from the price drop while HLP absorbed the risk. It was a calculated move, not an accident. Analyst View: Was This an Exploit? Hyperliquid maintains that this wasn‚Äôt a traditional exploit. Unlike GLP, which is forced to take the other side of trades, Hyperliquid‚Äôs model allows for market makers to step in. In this case, while HLP suffered a $4 million loss, it wasn‚Äôt system-breaking‚Äîthe vault remains profitable overall. The loss was simply execution slippage, meaning the liquidator couldn‚Äôt perfectly match entry and exit prices. Analyst further points out that this isn‚Äôt the first time HLP has been targeted. In 2023, an attacker manipulated SNX prices on centralized exchanges, exploiting the vault for $37,000. Since then, Hyperliquid has adjusted its pricing models to prevent similar incidents. Regarding commentary and questions on the 0xf3f4 user's ETH long: To be clear: There was no protocol exploit or hack. This user had unrealized PNL, withdrew, which lowered their margin, and was liquidated. They ended with ~$1.8M in PNL. HLP lost ~$4M over the past 24h. HLP's‚Ä¶ ‚Äî Hyperliquid (@HyperliquidX) March 12, 2025 Will This Happen Again? Hyperliquid Responds Following the loss, Hyperliquid quickly implemented risk adjustments, including lowering max leverage to 40x for Bitcoin and 25x for Ethereum, and increasing margin requirements for large positions. More adjustments to HLP‚Äôs risk models are likely on the way. The incident briefly caused a 12% drop in Hyperliquid‚Äôs HYPE token , though it later recovered. Despite the loss, HLP remains profitable, having generated $60 million for investors since launch. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

On Thursday, XRP opened trading at $2.24, marking an 18% rise from Tuesday‚Äôs local low of $1.90. The recent price uptick coincided with growing optimism over a potential ceasefire in the Russia-Ukraine conflict and a cooling inflation trend in the U.S. economy. February‚Äôs CPI data revealed that the inflation rate eased to 2.8%, down from 3% in January, and below the anticipated 2.9%. On a monthly basis, CPI rose just 0.2%, significantly lower than January‚Äôs 0.5% increase. FedWatch Tool, March 13 2025 | Source: CME Group Market sentiment suggests that these inflation figures have alleviated concerns sparked by last Friday‚Äôs disappointing U.S. Non-Farm Payroll (NFP) report, which initially fueled recession fears. In response, traders are shifting their outlook toward a prolonged period of steady interest rates, boosting investor confidence across risk assets like XRP. Taking these developments into account, CME Group‚Äôs FedWatch tool ‚Äîwidely used by institutional investors‚Äînow signals a near-certain 99% probability that the Federal Reserve will maintain current rates in its March 21 decision. Should this outlook hold, crypto markets, including XRP, could see renewed capital inflows as traders who previously exited amid NFP uncertainty re-enter positions, anticipating a sustained bullish trend. XRP Derivative market analysis The latest XRP derivatives data from Coinglass indicates an emerging bullish sentiment, as key metrics suggest increasing trader confidence. Open interest has risen by 3.48% to $3.05 billion, signalling growing commitment among traders to their existing positions. More so, options open interest surged 10.69% to $1.37 million, reflecting a stronger institutional appetite for leveraged exposure to XRP price movements. XRP Derivative market analysis | March 13 While spot volume has dipped slightly by 3.96% to $8.35 billion, the increase in open interest suggests that traders are positioning for a potential upside rather than exiting the market. Further reinforcing the bullish case, Binance‚Äôs long/short ratio for XRP/USDT accounts stands at 2.49, while OKX traders show a similar bias with a 2.14 long/short ratio. This indicates that more traders are opening long positions in anticipation of further gains. Additionally, liquidation data shows that longs have outperformed shorts in recent liquidation events, with $4.25 million in long liquidations versus $4.61 million in short liquidations over 24 hours. This suggests that bears are losing control, potentially setting the stage for an XRP breakout above its $2.50 resistance level. XRP Price Forecast: Bulls Eye $2.60 as Market Recovers from Sell-off Phase XRP price is attempting to recover after a steep 27.53% correction, stabilizing above $2.24 as buyers defend the early recovery gains. According to market volume data, the XRP price rebound comes as volume contracts following a 1.63 billion token selloff, signaling that sellers are losing momentum. The recent 18.88% price surge over two days indicates renewed bullish pressure, with XRP attempting to reclaim the $2.34 resistance level, which aligns with the 20-day EMA. A successful breakout above this threshold could pave the way for a rally toward $2.60, where the upper Bollinger Band currently sits, acting as the next major resistance zone. XRP Price Forecast On the downside, failure to hold above $2.24 could reignite selling pressure, with the lower Bollinger Band at $1.92 emerging as key support. However, the long/short ratio data from Binance and OKX, showing a strong bullish bias, suggests market sentiment favors the upside. If momentum sustains, XRP could push toward $2.76, a key level from recent highs. However, a rejection at $2.34 may delay further gains, leaving the market range-bound before a decisive breakout.

Generally, the scammers will contact a target with a meeting offer or partnership, but once the call starts, they send a message feigning audio issues while a stock video of a bored venture capitalist is on the screen; they then send a link to a new call, according to Bax. Having audio issues on your Zoom call? That's not a VC, it's North Korean hackers. Fortunately, this founder realized what was going on. The call starts with a few ""VCs"" on the call.

Giulio Xiloyannis, co-founder of the blockchain gaming Mon Protocol, said scammers tried to dupe him and the head of marketing with a meeting about a partnership opportunity. However, he was alerted to the ruse when, at the last minute, he was prompted to use a Zoom link that ‚Äúpretends to not be able to read your audio to make you install malware.‚Äù ‚ÄúThe moment I saw a Gumicryptos partner speaking and a Superstate one I realized something was off,‚Äù he said.

He said the scammers used his Google Meet link but then made up an excuse about an internal meeting, asking him to join that meeting instead. ‚ÄúThe site acted like a normal Zoom call. I took the call on my tablet though, so not sure what the behavior would‚Äôve been on desktop,‚Äù Zhang said. ‚ÄúIt probably tried to determine the OS before prompting the user to do something, but it just wasn‚Äôt built for mobile Oses.‚Äù Source: David Zhang Melbin Thomas, founder of Devdock AI, a decentralized AI platform for Web3 projects, said he was also hit with the scam and was unsure if his tech was still at risk. ‚ÄúThe same thing happened to me.

DeepSeek‚Äôs¬†Emergence: AI-Powered Innovation Triggers Industry Transformation In Q4 2024, the market saw a surge in top-tier AI Agents projects backed by Launchpads, driving a wave of asset issuance and quickly attracting capital and users. However, as the ICO rush began to subside, the hype in the AI Agents space had run its course. The market now urgently needed a catalyst to reignite growth. DeepSeek‚Äôs breakthrough technology leverages pure reinforcement learning (RL) to enhance AI‚Äôs reasoning capabilities while significantly reducing costs. This advancement positions AI as a more effective partner for real-world applications, transforming the AI Agent sector. This progress could breathe new life into the Agent field and reshape the industry landscape. The research report heralds DeepSeek‚Äôs debut as the ‚ÄúiPhone Moment‚Äù of the AI sector. Much like how the iPhone revolutionized the smartphone market, DeepSeek‚Äôs innovative technology is poised to lead a new era of crypto-tech development over the next few years. The Unique Value and Accelerating Growth of AI Agents The AI Agents ecosystem consists of four main sectors: AI Agent Frameworks: These serve as the core infrastructure for the AI Agents ecosystem, lowering development barriers and accelerating AI‚Äôs application. The Eliza project stands out with its technical innovations and sustainable business model. AI launchpads serve as hybrid incubators and trading platforms in the crypto space, lowering entry barriers for AI Agent projects and accelerating their launch, funding, and promotion. AI Agent meme coins, which blend AI and meme narratives, have strong potential to go viral, making them effective tools for rapid capital accumulation. Examples include BULLY from the Virtual ecosystem and TAOCAT and LLM from the Bittensor ecosystem. AI Agent applications focus on the implementation and commercialization of the technology in real-world scenarios, covering areas such as automated trading, asset management, market analysis, and cross-chain interaction. Representative projects are GRIFFAIN, NEUR, and BUZZ. AI Agent applications are expected to become the most promising segment in the sector. The report emphasizes that deep expertise and resilience are vital for the success of AI Agent teams. Teams like Virtual, SEKOIA, ai16z, and Swarm have proven this through their perseverance and dedication. Additionally, product usability is a critical factor in driving user adoption and widespread acceptance in the crypto market. 2025: The Maturation of Crypto Combining with Agents, Where Revenue and User Adoption Drive Value As the AI Agents market matures, it‚Äôs transitioning from a narrative-driven phase to one where value is based on data and revenue. The success of AI Agent projects will no longer be dictated by hype or the founding team‚Äôs pedigree but by their ability to achieve sustainable profitability and address real user needs through innovation. Directions that deserve future attention: Multi-Agent Systems and DeFAI (Decentralized Finance + AI): These sectors showcase AI‚Äôs tremendous potential for complex decision-making and financial automation, signaling long-term growth. Core Framework Updates: It‚Äôs essential to monitor the ongoing evolution of critical frameworks like Eliza and ARC, as their upgrades could create entirely new applications and business models.

41578169,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=139703,1741850720,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Surprising Bitcoin ETF Inflow: US Spot ETFs Recover with $14M Net Gain,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/bitcoin-etf-net-inflow-returns/,"After a spell of unease in the crypto markets, here‚Äôs a breath of fresh air: U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs have bounced back into positive territory! Ending a five-day run of net outflows, these investment vehicles collectively recorded a net inflow of $14.03 million on March 12th. Let‚Äôs dive into the details of this intriguing shift and what it might signal for the Bitcoin landscape. Bitcoin ETF Inflows Return: What Sparked the Turnaround? For the past week, the narrative surrounding spot Bitcoin ETFs had been dominated by net outflows, raising concerns about investor sentiment. However, data from Trader T (@thepfund) on X reveals a significant change on March 12th. A total net inflow of $14.03 million suggests a renewed interest, or at least a temporary pause in selling pressure, in these newly accessible Bitcoin investment products. This positive shift prompts the question: Is this a momentary blip, or the start of a sustained trend? Let‚Äôs break down the performance of individual ETFs to get a clearer picture. Spot Bitcoin ETF Performance: Who Were the Standout Performers? Not all crypto ETFs are created equal, and the March 12th data clearly illustrates this. While some funds enjoyed substantial inflows, others continued to experience outflows. Here‚Äôs a closer look at the key players: ARK Invest‚Äôs ARKB: The Star Performer ‚Äì Leading the pack by a significant margin, ARKB attracted a whopping $82.6 million in net inflows. This strong showing suggests robust investor confidence in ARK Invest‚Äôs Bitcoin ETF offering. Grayscale‚Äôs Mini BTC Trust (BTC): A Notable Inflow ‚Äì Following ARKB, Grayscale‚Äôs Mini BTC Trust also saw a positive inflow of $5.51 million. This is particularly interesting considering the outflows experienced by Grayscale‚Äôs original GBTC ETF. However, it wasn‚Äôt all green across the board. Several major ETFs experienced net outflows: BlackRock‚Äôs IBIT: A Rare Outflow ‚Äì Even industry giant BlackRock‚Äôs IBIT recorded net outflows of $46.36 million. While this might seem concerning, it‚Äôs crucial to remember that even the most successful ETFs can experience fluctuations in flows. Grayscale‚Äôs GBTC: Continued Outflows ‚Äì Grayscale‚Äôs GBTC continued its outflow trend, registering $11.81 million in net outflows. This ongoing trend is likely related to GBTC‚Äôs higher fee structure compared to newer spot Bitcoin ETFs. Other Outflows: Invesco‚Äôs BTCO ($12.4 million) and WisdomTree‚Äôs BTCW ($3.51 million) also experienced net outflows, indicating varying investor sentiment across different ETF providers. No Change: Interestingly, several other ETFs reported no changes in their holdings, suggesting a period of neutrality or balanced trading activity for these funds. To summarize the ETF performance, here‚Äôs a table for a clearer comparison: ETF Net Inflow/Outflow (March 12) ARK Invest‚Äôs ARKB $82.6 million (Inflow) Grayscale‚Äôs Mini BTC Trust $5.51 million (Inflow) BlackRock‚Äôs IBIT $46.36 million (Outflow) Grayscale‚Äôs GBTC $11.81 million (Outflow) Invesco‚Äôs BTCO $12.4 million (Outflow) WisdomTree‚Äôs BTCW $3.51 million (Outflow) Other ETFs No Change Decoding the ETF Inflows: What Does it Mean for the Bitcoin Market? The return to net ETF inflows , even at a modest $14.03 million, can be interpreted in several ways. Firstly, it could signal a temporary reprieve from selling pressure that had been impacting Bitcoin prices. Secondly, it might indicate that investors are viewing the recent price dips as buying opportunities, stepping in to accumulate Bitcoin exposure through ETFs. Thirdly, the strong performance of ARKB suggests that certain ETF issuers are successfully attracting new capital, potentially due to factors like marketing, brand recognition, or perceived fund management expertise. However, it‚Äôs crucial to maintain a balanced perspective. A single day of net inflows doesn‚Äôt necessarily confirm a long-term trend reversal. The Bitcoin market remains volatile and influenced by numerous factors, including macroeconomic conditions, regulatory developments, and broader risk sentiment. The outflows from IBIT and GBTC, despite the overall net inflow, also suggest that there‚Äôs still a degree of uncertainty or profit-taking occurring within the ETF space. Navigating the Crypto ETF Landscape: Actionable Insights for Investors For investors monitoring crypto ETFs , here are some actionable insights to consider: Diversification is Key: The varied performance of different ETFs highlights the importance of diversification. Don‚Äôt rely solely on one ETF provider; consider spreading your investments across multiple funds to mitigate risk. Monitor ETF Flows: Keep an eye on daily and weekly ETF flow data. Significant and sustained inflows can be a positive indicator for Bitcoin‚Äôs price, while consistent outflows may suggest bearish sentiment. Understand ETF Fee Structures: Be aware of the fees associated with different ETFs. Lower fees can result in better long-term returns, especially in a buy-and-hold strategy. GBTC‚Äôs higher fees are a key factor in its ongoing outflows. Consider ETF Holdings and Strategy: Research the underlying holdings and investment strategies of different ETFs. While most spot Bitcoin ETFs hold Bitcoin directly, nuances in custody solutions and fund management approaches may exist. Stay Informed: The crypto market is dynamic. Stay updated on market news, regulatory changes, and ETF developments to make informed investment decisions. Conclusion: A Glimmer of Hope or a Fleeting Moment? The $14.03 million net inflow into U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs on March 12th offers a welcome change from the recent outflow trend. While ARKB and Grayscale‚Äôs Mini BTC Trust led the inflows, the mixed performance across different ETFs underscores the evolving dynamics of this market. Whether this inflow marks the beginning of a sustained positive trend or a temporary pause remains to be seen. Investors should continue to monitor ETF flows, market sentiment, and broader macroeconomic factors to navigate the exciting yet unpredictable world of crypto investments.

Bitcoin reached its lowest point at $1,988 within a single day yet recovered by 3.9% before investors could pull out their funds. The market awaits confirmation from analysts to prove that ETH will break through resistance levels for an 18% price increase or fall to $1,500 due to descending triangle pressure. Investors now shift their focus to MUTM from Mutuum Finance because the DeFi token approaches the third presale phase while people expect major price increases. Ethereum‚Äôs Balancing Act The daily Ethereum price charts show a negative pattern of declining price levels accompanied by bearish patterns in significant moving averages which demonstrates weakening market strength. Despite a minor recovery, rejection near $2,152 underscores persistent selling pressure. The MACD technical indicators accompany bearish sentiment by showing sell signs while weekly exchange-traded fund withdrawals amount to $93.9 million dollars. Crypto analyst Ali Martinez detects a possible upward price movement when ETH is able to stay above significant trendlines for an 18% increase in value. The exposed position maintains dual characteristics which drives investors into temporary uncertainty. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Capitalizes on Market Jitters The Ethereum market instability creates an advantage for Mutuum Finance (MUTM) to emerge as a shining star during presales. Within Phase 3 of the project investors have contributed $3.1 million. The current price of $0.02 will increase to $0.025 during Phase 4. People who take part in early presales will receive a 25% profit boost during the following phase launch and the $0.06 listing value will result in a 200% profit increase for present purchasers. Research analysts predict that MUTM tokens will reach $3.50 by 2025 after presale completion which corresponds to a 17,400% value increase against current presale rates. The lending system of Mutuum Finance generates hope among its users. The platform generates innate demand for MUTM by issuing loans with multiple types of collateral and through mtTokens which represent deposits that generate an interest-bearing compensation. The tariff structure of the platform enhances supply reduction by pooling platform revenue into token purchases and stakeholder rewards. The project design delivers sustainable development support through its alignment against arbitrary resources without enduring substance. The period for investors to acquire Mutuum Finance at its lowest existing price is quickly running out. The current Phase 3 entry point at $0.02 is reaching quick sell-out levels while Phase 4 will boost its price by 25%. Phase 3 purchasers can seize a $0.06 exchange listing opportunity that provides triple returns before the platform launches to potentially deliver transformational profits. The early MUTM investors starting at $0.015 have secured a 400% profit increase while their potential profit potential might skyrocket if MUTM reaches its projected price of $3.50. Positioning for Exponential Returns Mathematical growth in combination with inherent market demand defines Mutuum Finance (MUTM) as an exceptional crypto investment opportunity. The presale success along with deflationary mechanisms in MUTM demonstrates better prospects than Ethereum‚Äôs wild market movements. Delaying would result in missing the last opportunity to buy MUTM tokens at low prices before volatility surges from exchange listings occur. The planned Ethereum volatility drives numerous investors to seek shelter in Mutuum Finance‚Äôs ongoing presale because its mathematical profitability model and practical utility features attract them. Waiting any longer to participate during Phase 3 will result in forfeiting what could become a 32 times profit opportunity. Buy MUTM tokens during this moment to secure your position in the market as prices will increase while the next price rally will leave your investment behind if delayed.

41578608,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=139701,1741851324,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Tempting Ethereum Buy? Alliance DAO Founder Sounds the Alarm on ETH‚Äôs Oversold State,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/ethereum-oversold-buying-temptation/,"Is Ethereum (ETH) currently presenting a golden buying opportunity? That‚Äôs the question rippling through the cryptocurrency community after prominent crypto figure Qiao Wang, a founding partner at Alliance DAO, declared Ethereum to be in an ‚Äúoversold‚Äù state. His recent comments on X (formerly Twitter) have sparked intense debate and renewed interest in the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization. Let‚Äôs dive deep into Wang‚Äôs analysis and what it could mean for you as a crypto investor. Is Ethereum Really Oversold? Qiao Wang‚Äôs Perspective Qiao Wang isn‚Äôt just any voice in the crypto space. As a founder of Alliance DAO, a significant player in decentralized autonomous organizations, his insights carry weight. Wang took to X to share his observation that Ethereum is oversold , drawing parallels to pivotal moments in crypto history. He specifically mentioned three instances where ETH price levels mirrored the current situation: The 2021 Terra Collapse: The dramatic implosion of the Terra ecosystem sent shockwaves through the entire crypto market, causing widespread panic and price drops, including for Ethereum. The 2018 Deep Bear Market: The infamous crypto winter of 2018 saw prolonged and significant price declines across the board, testing the resilience of even established cryptocurrencies like Ethereum. The Aftermath of the 2016 DAO Hack: The Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO) hack was a seminal event in Ethereum‚Äôs early days, leading to a hard fork and impacting investor confidence. Wang‚Äôs comparison to these critical junctures suggests he believes the current ETH price analysis reflects an undervaluation, potentially driven by market fear and uncertainty rather than fundamental weaknesses in Ethereum itself. He explicitly stated the temptation to buy ETH at these levels, indicating a belief in a potential price rebound. Why is Ethereum Oversold? Decoding the Market Dynamics To understand why Wang might consider Ethereum oversold , we need to look at the broader cryptocurrency market and specific factors impacting ETH. Several elements could be contributing to this perceived undervaluation: Macroeconomic Headwinds: Global economic uncertainty, inflation concerns, and rising interest rates often lead investors to reduce exposure to riskier assets like cryptocurrencies, putting downward pressure on prices. Regulatory Scrutiny: Ongoing regulatory debates and actions around cryptocurrencies create uncertainty and can dampen investor enthusiasm, particularly in the short term. Market Sentiment: Fear, uncertainty, and doubt (FUD) can become self-fulfilling prophecies in the crypto market. Negative news or price drops can trigger further selling, pushing prices below their intrinsic value. Profit-Taking and Rotation: After periods of growth, investors may take profits, leading to price corrections. Additionally, capital may rotate into other sectors or cryptocurrencies perceived to have higher short-term growth potential. These factors, combined with potentially exaggerated market reactions, could contribute to a situation where ETH price analysis suggests it‚Äôs trading below its fair value based on its technology, adoption, and long-term potential. The Contrarian View: Wang‚Äôs Past ETH Stance and Layer-2 Competition Interestingly, Wang‚Äôs current bullish (or at least ‚Äútempted to buy‚Äù) stance comes after he publicly disclosed selling his ETH holdings last year. In a podcast interview, he explained his decision, stating that after holding ETH for a decade, he believed its growth potential was nearing exhaustion. This highlights a crucial aspect of the Ethereum narrative: the rise of layer-2 solutions and competition from alternative blockchains like Solana. Wang estimated that Ethereum‚Äôs layer-2 scaling solutions, designed to improve transaction speed and reduce costs on the Ethereum network, have only a 10-20% chance of outperforming Solana (SOL). This is a significant statement, as it suggests he sees Solana, and potentially other layer-1 blockchains, as posing a serious challenge to Ethereum‚Äôs dominance in the long run. Ethereum Layer-2 Solutions vs. Solana: A Quick Comparison The debate between Ethereum‚Äôs layer-2 scaling approach and alternative layer-1 blockchains is central to understanding the future of the crypto ecosystem. Here‚Äôs a simplified comparison: Feature Ethereum Layer-2 Solutions (e.g., Arbitrum, Optimism, zkSync) Solana (SOL) Scaling Approach Off-chain processing while inheriting Ethereum‚Äôs security Optimized layer-1 blockchain for high throughput Transaction Speed Significantly faster and cheaper than mainnet Ethereum Very high transaction speed and low fees Ecosystem Maturity Growing ecosystem, but still developing compared to mainnet Ethereum Rapidly expanding ecosystem, gaining traction in DeFi and NFTs Security Inherits security from Ethereum mainnet Rely on its own consensus mechanism; security is constantly evolving Developer Adoption Strong developer community, leveraging Ethereum‚Äôs existing tools and resources Growing developer community, attracting projects seeking high performance Wang‚Äôs skepticism about Ethereum layer-2 solutions outperforming Solana likely stems from a belief that Solana‚Äôs layer-1 optimization offers a more direct and potentially more efficient path to scalability and user adoption. However, Ethereum‚Äôs layer-2 ecosystem is rapidly evolving, and advancements in technologies like zero-knowledge rollups could significantly alter this landscape. Actionable Insights: Navigating the Ethereum Oversold Situation So, what should you do with this information? Here are some actionable insights to consider: Do Your Own Research (DYOR): Wang‚Äôs opinion is valuable, but it‚Äôs crucial to conduct your own independent research. Look at Ethereum‚Äôs fundamentals, network activity, developer updates, and the broader market conditions. Consider Risk Tolerance: Investing in cryptocurrencies is inherently risky. Assess your risk tolerance and only invest what you can afford to lose. An oversold Ethereum might present an opportunity, but it‚Äôs not without risk. Diversify Your Portfolio: Don‚Äôt put all your eggs in one basket. Diversification across different cryptocurrencies and asset classes can help mitigate risk. Long-Term Perspective: Cryptocurrency markets are volatile. If you believe in the long-term potential of Ethereum, consider a long-term investment strategy rather than trying to time short-term market fluctuations. Stay Informed: Keep up-to-date with the latest news and developments in the crypto space, including Ethereum and its competitors. Follow reputable sources and analysts to make informed decisions. Conclusion: Is Now the Time to Buy Ethereum? Qiao Wang‚Äôs assertion that Ethereum is oversold is a compelling signal in the current market. His historical comparisons and the context of broader market dynamics suggest a potential buying opportunity for those who believe in Ethereum‚Äôs long-term prospects. However, it‚Äôs crucial to remember that even if ETH is currently undervalued, the cryptocurrency market remains volatile and unpredictable. Wang‚Äôs own past decision to sell ETH and his views on layer-2 competition serve as important reminders of the evolving nature of the crypto landscape and the need for careful consideration of both opportunities and risks. Ultimately, whether now is the right time to buy Ethereum depends on your individual investment strategy, risk tolerance, and belief in its future. Wang‚Äôs analysis provides a valuable perspective, but informed decision-making requires thorough research and a nuanced understanding of the cryptocurrency market .

Loaded Lions (LION) surged 35.3% over the past day, reaching an intraday high of $0.0081 at the time of writing, while its market cap remained just shy of $187 million, approaching the $1 billion mark. The price gains came along with a jump in trading volume, which nearly doubled over the past day, hovering around $3.4 million. The altcoin has continued its uptrend over the last nine days, rising over 250% during this period, outpacing the global bearish crypto market, which has fallen by nearly 7% in the same period. Today‚Äôs gains came as the project teased a major announcement planned by the end of this week through an official X post on March 12. Typically, the hype created in the community from such announcements leads to increased investor interest in the related altcoin, often driving up its price as traders anticipate positive developments. https://twitter.com/LoadedLions_CDC/status/1899807596816826389 Meanwhile, many community members expect that the project could be revealing its launch on the Ethereum blockchain. If confirmed, this could significantly boost LION‚Äôs price by increasing its accessibility, enhancing its utility, and attracting more investors looking to capitalize on its expanded ecosystem.

In the future, LION holders will also get governance rights to help shape the ecosystem. At press time, LION was trending across social media in the U.S., reflecting heightened retail interest. LION price analysis Technical indicators indicate that LION could see more gains in the short term. On the 1-hour/WCRO chart, LION has recently broken above the ascending parallel channel pattern it had been trading within since March 6, a break above which suggests a very dominant bullish trend supported by the strong buying pressure from traders. LION price, Supertrend and Aroon chart ‚Äî March 13 | Source: crypto.news The Supertrend indicator has moved below the price in the green zone, showing a bullish trend. At the same time, the Aroon Up is at 100%, while Aroon Down is at 0%, confirming strong buying pressure and a steady uptrend. Hence, LION could continue rallying, with the next target at the key resistance level of $0.0085. If it breaks above that, it could attract more bullish interest, pushing the price toward $0.01. Community expectations for LION in the long term range between $0.1725 and $0.20 by the end of 2025. Some even believe that a breakout above this level could push the price as high as $0.50 over the long run. At press time, LION was exchanging hands at $0.0080 per coin.

According to a March 12 report from local media outlet P√°gina 12, attorney Gregorio Dalbon, known for having represented former Argentine president Cristina Fern√°ndez de Kirchner, filed the request with prosecutor Eduardo Taiano and Judge Mar√≠a Servini. For those unaware, an Interpol Red Notice is essentially a global alert requesting law enforcement agencies worldwide to locate and provisionally arrest someone. Similar notices have been asked for in high-profile crypto cases, including for Terraform Labs‚Äô Do Kwon. In court documents, Dalbon reasoned that Davis played a ‚Äúcentral role‚Äù in the creation and promotion of the LIBRA token and posed a ‚Äúprocedural risk‚Äù due to his financial resources, ‚Äúwhich could make it easier for him‚Äù to flee or go into hiding. LIBRA became a national controversy after Argentine President Javier Milei shared it on social media just minutes after its launch, fueling speculation that his endorsement contributed to its meteoric rise. However, the token‚Äôs price crashed soon after, wiping out $4.4 billion in market capitalization and leaving many investors with heavy losses .

Davis, for his part, resurfaced recently after weeks of silence, announcing that he has hired legal representation and plans to address the case. His legal team includes Brian Klein of Waymaker Law, a well-known firm that handles complex financial crime cases involving the SEC and the U.S. Justice Department. In a statement, Davis maintained his innocence , claiming he ‚Äúonly wanted and sought the success‚Äù of LIBRA and had no intent to defraud investors, the P√°gina 12 report added. Meanwhile, Milei has also denied any wrongdoing , insisting he merely ‚Äúspread the word‚Äù about the token rather than formally promoting it. As previously reported by crypto.news, last week, Taiano told local media that he intends to freeze roughly 110 million in assets as part of an ongoing investigation into Milei‚Äôs involvement in the LIBRA scandal.

Centralized exchanges like Coinbase and Kraken are the easiest reputable platforms on which to buy Bitcoin with credit cards. To protect yourself during transactions, only use trusted exchanges and use security protocols like 2FA. Credit card purchases can offer some extra protection against fraud compared to other payment methods, but purchase limits can be more restrictive Looking for the quickest and easiest way to purchase Bitcoin? Buying Bitcoin with a credit card is almost instant on many platforms. Before you start your digital shopping spree, you should take a few minutes to learn how to buy Bitcoin ( BTC ) with a credit card in the most efficient way. However, if you‚Äôre not careful, you could end up damaging your credit score and even getting scammed out of your investments. Below, you will find a step-by-step process for purchasing Bitcoin on a reputable exchange, plus learn how to protect yourself from unnecessary financial distress along the way. Why use a credit card for Bitcoin purchases? Buying Bitcoin via a credit card is almost instant on major exchanges. It can be performed easily on a mobile device or web, allowing buyers and traders to quickly take advantage of market moves. Often, the cryptocurrency exchanges that accept credit cards are regulated and will use high levels of encryption. These exchanges will require Know Your Customer (KYC) and Anti-Money Laundering (AML) checks for security and compliance. Purchasing Bitcoin with a credit card is a beginner-friendly option for new cryptocurrency investors already familiar with using their credit cards for online transactions. There may be some protection from the credit card company if something goes awry. Will buying Bitcoin with a credit card affect my credit score? Every purchasing decision you make with your credit card will have an effect on your credit score, either positive or negative. Crypto is likely to do more harm than good to a credit score. Here‚Äôs why: Particularly with large Bitcoin purchases, it will increase your credit utilization ratio. Banks don‚Äôt reflect kindly to high credit utilization above 50% of a credit limit. Traditional banks and card issuers classify crypto purchases as cash advances and risky transactions. Payment history still remains the key factor in your credit score. Credit issuers may well frown upon regular Bitcoin purchases. Did you know? Over 85% of retailers across the world accept credit cards, while only 25% of online retailers accept crypto payments. Credit cards are still more widely accepted; however, crypto acceptance is growing quickly. Where to buy Bitcoin (BTC) with a credit card You could buy Bitcoin with credit cards on centralized crypto exchanges (CEXs) . Well-known global platforms like Coinbase, Kraken and Binance all enable their users to buy Bitcoin with a credit card. Adding to this, you can use instant buy features to purchase Bitcoin with a credit card without depositing fiat currency into your account first. However, the regional availability for CEXs varies from platform to platform. This is usually dependent on local regulations and compliance. So, before picking a platform, you should check if it operates in your location and with your card issuer. What if a credit card transaction is declined? Many traditional banks actively block crypto-related transactions, which means you might find your credit card declined when attempting to purchase Bitcoin or other cryptocurrencies. This is often due to the bank‚Äôs policy against facilitating cryptocurrency transactions. However, there is good news: Modern fintech banking alternatives, such as digital banks and crypto-friendly payment platforms, are increasingly supportive of cryptocurrency purchases, offering a smoother transaction experience. Aside from bank restrictions, other reasons for declined crypto transactions can include fraud prevention measures, where the transaction is flagged as suspicious. Additionally, exceeding your credit card‚Äôs spending limit or encountering issues with your card‚Äôs authorization settings can also lead to a declined transaction. Is there a limit to how much Bitcoin can be bought with a credit card? The purchase limit for Bitcoin varies for each individual and is influenced by two main factors. First, the spending limit on your credit card, which is determined by your bank or card issuer. Second, the crypto exchange you‚Äôre using will impose its own purchase limits. For first-time buyers, these limits can be relatively low ‚Äî often just a few hundred dollars. However, depending on the exchange and your account history, these limits can typically be increased to $5,000 or more per week if needed. You should also be aware of the credit card Bitcoin purchase fees that can include: Exchange fees: Typically 3%‚Äì5% for credit card purchases (this is higher than other methods, which can be as low as 0.1%). Card issuer fees: Some treat crypto purchases as cash advances. Foreign transaction fees: It may apply to fiat foreign currency transactions. Did you know? 8%‚Äì10% of the adult global population is thought to own cryptocurrency of some form in 2025. A huge jump from 1%‚Äì2% in 2018, highlighting the increasing adoption rate. How to buy Bitcoin on CEXs with a credit card Buying Bitcoin with a credit card is one of the quickest and easiest ways to make a purchase. Once you have a verified exchange account, you can make the transaction almost instantly. Below is a step-by-step guide on how to buy Bitcoin with a Visa or Mastercard on Coinbase. Steps on other exchanges may vary, but the process is generally very similar. Step 1: Create a verified account Follow the user-friendly sign-up process. Ensure to activate 2-factor authentication (2FA) to double-lock your account. During the sign-up process, you‚Äôll need to verify your identity. Crypto regulations in many countries require exchanges to comply with KYC and AML regulations. To pass these checks, you must upload a valid government ID (passport, driving license or any other acceptable ID card). Step 2: Link your credit card Once your account is accessible, use the right-hand side panel to add your payment method. This will give you the option to link a credit card. Add your card details and click ‚ÄúAdd Card.‚Äù Step 3: Buy Bitcoin Using the right-hand side panel instant buy feature, select Bitcoin and the amount you‚Äôd like to purchase. The exchange buy limit will also be shown next to your credit card payment method. This is usually limited to 10,000 British pounds daily on Coinbase. When ready, click ‚ÄúBuy Now.‚Äù Confirm the purchase on your banking app. Once approved, the Bitcoin will be added to your exchange account and fiat debited from your credit card. How to protect yourself from fraud when buying Bitcoin with a credit card The irreversible nature of Bitcoin means security and fraud prevention should be at the top of your list. It is your responsibility to protect your financial information and crypto from being compromised. To stay safe when buying Bitcoin, you should: Only use a reputable and regulated exchange with a strong security record. Use core security features, including unique passwords and 2FA. Watch out for phishing attempts . Double-check URLs, and don‚Äôt click email links or unsolicited messages. Consider moving Bitcoin into a self-custody hardware wallet to protect against exchange hacks and fraud. Is it safe to buy BTC with a credit card? It is generally considered that buying Bitcoin with a credit card is one of the safest methods. This is because it helps to protect your wider financial information, such as direct access to bank accounts. You can also benefit from fraud prevention and spending limits that credit card companies offer. So, if your card details or accounts fall into the wrong hands, you will have higher levels of protection. Plus, there is even some recourse to reverse payments and have fraudulent payments struck off. While it does offer added protection and convenience, purchases will come at a higher cost. Credit card companies typically charge higher fees for crypto transactions, and you may face restrictions on the size of Bitcoin purchases. Many exchanges impose lower purchase limits for credit card transactions, especially for first-time buyers, which could make it less appealing for larger investments. Despite these drawbacks, the extra protection and ease of use make it a convenient option for those new to the crypto space. This article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.

This request aims to have Davis located and detained globally, pending extradition from the United States. Dalb√≥n, known for representing former Argentine President Cristina Fern√°ndez de Kirchner, filed the petition alongside lead prosecutor Eduardo Taiano and Judge Mar√≠a Servini. The petition argues that Davis is a significant flight risk due to his financial resources and foreign residency. Local reports highlight that the scale of investor losses justifies immediate legal action. Meanwhile, LIBRA‚Äôs price continues to decline sharply amid growing fear and uncertainty. The bearish market conditions have only worsened the situation for retail investors who have already suffered significant losses. Blockchain analysis firm Nansen has reported that LIBRA insiders secured major profits , while ordinary investors faced staggering losses. Wallets linked to Davis and another key figure, Kelsier, managed to withdraw substantial amounts before the token collapsed. Blockchain investigators also found evidence of market manipulation tactics, such as automated bot purchases to control liquidity. Davis has acknowledged using such tactics but claimed they were meant to prevent an immediate crash and reinvest liquidity when Argentine President Javier Milei resumed promoting the token. However, this plan failed, leaving many retail investors at a loss while insiders profited. The controversy deepens as LIBRA‚Äôs team has been linked to other questionable crypto ventures, including MELANIA, another project accused of being a rug pull . Reports also suggest that LIBRA insiders were in discussions with officials from Nigeria to launch a similar token, raising concerns about repeated crypto-related schemes across multiple countries. Authorities in Argentina have already frozen millions of dollars in crypto tied to the scheme. The LIBRA scandal has also led to ripple effects within the broader cryptocurrency industry. Ben Chow, co-founder of the decentralized finance platform Meteora, recently resigned, further highlighting how deeply the issue has shaken the sector. If Interpol approves Dalb√≥n‚Äôs request for a Red Notice, Davis will be flagged as a wanted individual across 195 countries. While a Red Notice does not mandate immediate arrest, it serves as a warning to international law enforcement agencies that Davis is being pursued for extradition. As the situation unfolds, the LIBRA meme coin continues its steep decline, reflecting the damage caused by the scandal. Investors remain uncertain about potential legal resolutions, and the case continues to cast a shadow over Argentina‚Äôs political and financial landscape.",,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|REGULATION|MARKET|BLOCKCHAIN|TRADING,"{'name': 'Coinpaprika', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/80/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaprika,2025-03-13 07:45:07
41578943,https://coinpedia.org/?p=431370,1741851943,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png,US Inflation Drops Below Expectations ‚Äì Will the Fed Cut Interest Rates?,https://coinpedia.org/news/us-inflation-drops-below-expectations-will-the-fed-cut-interest-rates/,"The post US Inflation Drops Below Expectations ‚Äì Will the Fed Cut Interest Rates? appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News In February, the US Core Inflation rate declined from 3.3% to 3.1%, and the US Inflation rate dropped from 3% to 2.8% . The inflation index releases have left many surprised, as the general expectation was that the core inflation rate would drop from 3.3% to 3.2% and the inflation rate would decline from 3% to 2.9%. The development has triggered discussions on Fed rate cuts. Will the US Federal Reserve cut interest rates? Let‚Äôs analyse! US Inflation Falls Below Expectations Both the US Core Inflation rate and the Inflation rate declined in February, compared to January 2025. It is the first time since July 2024 that both of these indexes have simultaneously dropped. In July 2024, the core inflation slipped from 3.3% to 3.2%, and the inflation rate decreased from 3% to 2.9%. The consistent drop in inflation rates between January and July 2024 was one of the reasons that encouraged the Federal Reserve to announce a series of interest rate cuts post July. In September, for the first time since July 2023, the interest rate was lowered from 5.5% to 5%. In November, it was reduced from 5% to 4.75%. In December, it was lowered to 4.5% from 4.75%. Will the Fed Cut Interest Rates? Cooling inflation means there is a high chance of an interest rate cut in the US. According to reports, the possibility of a rate cut in May has grown from 10% to 31.4%, while the likelihood of a cut by year-end has increased from 6.5% to 32.5%. The chance of four rate cuts this year has surged from 1% to 21%. Bitcoin Drops Despite Positive Inflation News In the last 30 days, the Bitcoin price has dropped by 15.3%. In the last seven days alone, the price has slipped by 9.3%. Yesterday, the Bitcoin market rose from $82,914.61 to $83,660.58. Currently, the market stands at $83,165.61 ‚Äì at least 0.59% below yesterday‚Äôs closing price. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

41578954,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=139746,1741851958,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Landmark: Ripple Secures Dubai Crypto License for Regulated XRP Services ‚Äì A Game Changer?,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/ripple-secures-dubai-crypto-license/,"In a significant stride for the digital asset landscape, Ripple, the company renowned for its XRP cryptocurrency and blockchain-based payment solutions, has just announced a major victory. They‚Äôve clinched the coveted approval from the Dubai Financial Services Authority (DFSA) to offer regulated cryptocurrency services within the Dubai International Finance Centre (DIFC). This exciting development signals a substantial expansion of Ripple‚Äôs global footprint and opens up new avenues for businesses in the United Arab Emirates (UAE) to leverage cutting-edge crypto technologies. Let‚Äôs dive into what this groundbreaking news means for Ripple, the crypto world, and the future of digital payments in the region. Decoding the Ripple Dubai Approval: What Does DFSA Clearance Mean? Securing the DFSA approval isn‚Äôt just another feather in Ripple‚Äôs cap; it‚Äôs a powerful testament to their commitment to regulatory compliance and their vision for mainstream crypto adoption. The DFSA is the independent regulator of financial services conducted in or from the DIFC, a leading global financial hub. Obtaining their clearance is a rigorous process, demanding adherence to stringent standards of operation, security, and consumer protection. For Ripple, this Dubai crypto license signifies: Legitimacy and Trust: Operating under DFSA regulation provides a stamp of approval, enhancing trust and credibility among institutions and businesses in the UAE. Access to the DIFC Ecosystem: The DIFC is home to a vast network of international banks, financial institutions, and multinational corporations. This approval grants Ripple access to offer its services to these key players. Regulatory Clarity: Operating within a regulated framework provides clarity and legal certainty, crucial for businesses hesitant about venturing into the often-murky waters of cryptocurrency regulations. Expansion of Global Payments Product: This approval allows Ripple to extend its global payments product, leveraging XRP, to companies within the UAE, facilitating faster, cheaper, and more transparent cross-border transactions. Why is Dubai a Strategic Location for Ripple‚Äôs Crypto Expansion? Dubai, and the UAE as a whole, has emerged as a progressive hub for innovation and technology, particularly in the blockchain and cryptocurrency space. Choosing Dubai for this strategic expansion is a smart move by Ripple for several compelling reasons: Pro-Crypto Stance: The UAE government has demonstrated a forward-thinking approach to digital assets, actively seeking to create a conducive environment for crypto businesses to thrive. Financial Hub Status: Dubai‚Äôs DIFC is a globally recognized financial center, attracting significant international business and investment. This makes it an ideal launchpad for Ripple to further its institutional adoption goals. Gateway to the Middle East and Beyond: Dubai serves as a strategic gateway to the broader Middle East, Africa, and South Asia (MEASA) region, offering Ripple access to a vast and rapidly growing market. Talent and Infrastructure: Dubai boasts a skilled workforce, advanced infrastructure, and a strong technological ecosystem, providing a solid foundation for Ripple‚Äôs operations. Unpacking the Benefits of Ripple‚Äôs Regulated Crypto Services in the UAE The introduction of Ripple‚Äôs Dubai approval for regulated crypto services within the DIFC promises a range of benefits for businesses operating in the UAE. Let‚Äôs explore some key advantages: Benefit Description Faster Payments Leveraging XRP and Ripple‚Äôs technology can significantly reduce transaction settlement times compared to traditional banking systems, enabling near-instant cross-border payments. Lower Costs Traditional international payments often involve hefty fees and intermediary charges. Ripple‚Äôs solutions aim to minimize these costs, making cross-border transactions more affordable. Increased Transparency Blockchain technology provides enhanced transparency in payment processing, allowing for better tracking and auditability of transactions. Enhanced Efficiency Automated processes and reduced reliance on manual interventions streamline payment workflows, boosting operational efficiency for businesses. Regulatory Compliant Operations Operating under DFSA regulation ensures compliance with international standards, mitigating risks and fostering a secure environment for crypto transactions. Challenges and Considerations for Ripple‚Äôs UAE Venture While the DFSA crypto regulation approval is a major win, Ripple will still need to navigate certain challenges and considerations as they roll out their services in Dubai: Market Adoption: While Dubai is crypto-friendly, broader adoption of XRP and Ripple‚Äôs solutions will require ongoing education and outreach to businesses and financial institutions in the region. Competition: The crypto landscape is competitive, with various players offering cross-border payment solutions. Ripple will need to differentiate itself and demonstrate its unique value proposition. Regulatory Evolution: Crypto regulations are still evolving globally. Ripple will need to remain adaptable and compliant with any future regulatory changes in the UAE and internationally. XRP Price Volatility: Like many cryptocurrencies, XRP can experience price volatility, which might be a concern for some businesses using it for payments. However, Ripple‚Äôs solutions aim to mitigate this through efficient transaction processing. Examples of How Businesses Can Leverage Ripple‚Äôs Dubai Crypto Services Imagine a multinational corporation with its regional headquarters in Dubai. With XRP Dubai expansion , they can now utilize Ripple‚Äôs regulated services to: Streamline Payments to International Suppliers: Instead of relying on slow and expensive traditional wire transfers, they can use XRP-powered payments to quickly and cost-effectively pay suppliers across borders. Facilitate Faster Remittances: Businesses involved in remittances can offer faster and cheaper services to individuals sending money to and from the UAE. Optimize Treasury Operations: Companies can leverage XRP for efficient and transparent treasury management, moving funds between subsidiaries and accounts globally with greater speed and control. Enable New Business Models: The speed and efficiency of crypto payments can unlock new business models and opportunities, such as instant cross-border e-commerce and real-time settlement for international trade. Actionable Insights: What Does This Mean for the Crypto Community? Ripple‚Äôs UAE crypto services approval carries significant implications for the wider cryptocurrency community: Validation of Crypto Regulation: This approval underscores the growing recognition by regulators worldwide that cryptocurrencies can be integrated into the mainstream financial system through well-defined regulatory frameworks. Increased Institutional Adoption: As more regulated crypto services become available, we can expect to see increased institutional adoption of digital assets, driving further growth and maturity in the market. Positive Signal for XRP: The news is undoubtedly positive for XRP, demonstrating its utility in real-world payment solutions and its growing acceptance in regulated environments. Global Expansion Trend: Ripple‚Äôs Dubai move sets a precedent for other crypto companies seeking to expand their regulated operations globally, paving the way for a more interconnected and compliant crypto ecosystem. Conclusion: A Promising Future for Crypto Payments in Dubai and Beyond Ripple securing DFSA approval in Dubai is more than just a regulatory milestone; it‚Äôs a triumph for the entire cryptocurrency industry. It highlights the potential for digital assets to revolutionize global payments and signifies a growing embrace of crypto innovation within established financial hubs. As Ripple expands its regulated services in the UAE, we can anticipate a wave of positive changes, fostering greater efficiency, transparency, and accessibility in cross-border transactions. This development not only benefits businesses in Dubai and the UAE but also sends a powerful message to the world: the future of finance is increasingly digital, and regulated crypto services are poised to play a pivotal role.

These banks provide services such as custody, trading, and fiat-crypto conversions, making Europe the leading region for integrating cryptocurrency into traditional finance. The rise of crypto-friendly banks is largely due to the development of a solid regulatory framework. Countries such as Germany, Switzerland, Liechtenstein, and Lithuania have pioneered this movement, hosting well-known institutions like SEBA Bank, Bank Frick, and Revolut. These banks enable cryptocurrency transactions and offer secure storage, staking, and asset tokenization services. Compared to other regions, Europe is far ahead. In the United States, banks have only recently gained permission to engage with crypto-related services following the White House Crypto Summit . Meanwhile, Europe has already established regulations that encourage banks to participate in the sector. A major factor behind this growth is the Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA) framework , which creates clear regulations for banks and financial institutions dealing with cryptocurrencies. MiCA ensures a secure and transparent environment, helping service providers expand across borders while gaining reliable access to banking support. The legal clarity provided by MiCA has made it easier for banks to integrate crypto services, setting Europe apart from regions with uncertain regulations. Taking advantage of these progressive laws, countries like Germany , Switzerland, and Malta have also introduced favorable tax policies. For example, Germany applies a 0% tax on long-term crypto profits, making it an attractive destination for investors. Digital banks, including Revolut, N26, and Fidor , have quickly embraced cryptocurrency services, appealing to modern customers seeking seamless digital finance solutions. These neobanks are often more agile than traditional U.S. banks, which remain cautious due to stricter regulations. Despite its leadership, Europe faces challenges such as price volatility, fraud risks, and strict Anti-Money Laundering (AML) and Know-Your-Customer (KYC) regulations. These obstacles require constant regulatory adjustments to ensure security while maintaining growth. With MiCA set to take full effect soon, Europe is likely to maintain its dominant position. However, growing regulations in Asia could introduce competition. To remain the leader in crypto-friendly banking, Europe must continue refining its policies and addressing emerging risks in the digital finance landscape.",,EN,0,0,REGULATION|ASIA|FIAT|TRADING|BUSINESS,"{'name': 'Coinpaprika', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/80/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaprika,2025-03-13 07:48:03

XRP Lawsuit: Why the SEC‚Äôs Delay Isn‚Äôt a Pivotal Issue? Lawyer Fred Rispoli is downplaying the role of the US Securities and Exchange Commission‚Äôs (SEC) delay in resolving the XRP lawsuit. Despite many considering the delay a major obstacle, Rispoli believes the case‚Äôs resolution is simpler than anticipated. Rispoli stated , ‚ÄúI just don‚Äôt see this being the big issue some are making it out to be‚Ä¶it‚Äôs unorthodox, but not difficult.‚Äù Significantly, Rispoli‚Äôs comments suggest that the SEC‚Äôs delay may not be a critical factor in the XRP lawsuit as many believe. He urges the community to shift the focus from the delay to the potential outcomes and implications of the lawsuit‚Äôs resolution. Previously, Rispoli dismissed discussions surrounding the SEC‚Äôs delay, deeming them unnecessary. He also addressed the SEC‚Äôs excuses as cowardly. Key Considerations Regarding Torres‚Äô Order: Lawyer‚Äôs Insights According to lawyer Fred Rispoli, the delay in the Ripple-SEC case isn‚Äôt a significant issue. This sentiment is echoed in his statement that the SEC will handle Judge Torres‚Äô enforcement order, not the judge herself. In addition, Rispoli shared insights on the Ripple and SEC‚Äôs possible move to jointly file a motion to vacate the judgment. The lawyer deems this as the ‚Äúcleanest way‚Äù to dismiss the XRP lawsuit. This approach involves the SEC and Ripple agreeing to vacate the judgment in exchange for Ripple dropping its appeal. Recently, an XRP advocacy platform, All Things XRP, shared five possible outcomes of the Ripple lawsuit. The potential outcomes include withdrawal of the SEC‚Äôs appeal, reduction of Ripple‚Äôs penalty, reversal of the court decision, lifting of the injunction, and complete closure of the case by the SEC. SEC‚Äôs Flexibility in Resolving Ripple Case Further, Rispoli shed light on the SEC‚Äôs flexibility to resolve the XRP lawsuit without vacating the order. The regulator can bypass vacating the order by drafting a settlement agreement with Ripple, agreeing not to enforce the judgment in exchange for Ripple dropping its appeal. Interestingly, the SEC Enforcement Manual prioritizes cooperation and settlement over litigation. This provides a framework for the regulator‚Äôs actions. However, the agency has historically exercised its discretion, sometimes bypassing due process. In this case, the agency‚Äôs flexibility could facilitate a fair outcome for the Ripple lawsuit, stated Rispoli. Rispoli‚Äôs comment comes in response to Fox Business journalist Eleanor Terrett‚Äôs report on an imminent XRP lawsuit settlement.

This transition has led to increased selling pressure, reflecting a shift in investor sentiment toward caution. Many market participants are now prioritizing liquidation over adding to their holdings, leading to downward pressure on Bitcoin's price. Recent data indicates that Bitcoin‚Äôs price structure has entered a phase typically seen after all-time highs. This phase follows the natural cycle of accumulation and distribution, where investors adjust their positions based on market trends. The latest distribution phase began in early 2025, coinciding with Bitcoin‚Äôs sharp correction. Investor activity further confirms this shift. All wallet size categories have contributed to the increased selling pressure , indicating that both large and small holders are actively reducing their positions. The impact of this trend has been particularly noticeable since mid-January, with a growing number of investors selling their assets at a loss, intensifying the market downturn. Market sentiment has also changed significantly. As uncertainty rises, investors have become more hesitant to increase their positions. Macroeconomic factors, including financial instability and trade tensions, have contributed to this cautious outlook. Earlier in the cycle, investors were actively buying Bitcoin during price pullbacks , expecting a continued uptrend. However, as liquidity tightened and risks increased, confidence in further accumulation declined. The lack of buying activity at lower levels suggests a capital rotation is taking place , leading to the possibility of a prolonged consolidation phase before the market finds stable ground. This means that Bitcoin could continue fluctuating until a strong support level is established. Despite these concerns, some analysts believe there are signs of stabilization. Observers have noted that the largest Bitcoin distribution by long-term holders in recent years appears to be tapering off. Selling activity from long-term holders has slowed , indicating a possible return to confidence among experienced investors. If this trend continues, it could lead to reduced market supply and potential stabilization. Bitcoin‚Äôs price remains volatile, with fluctuations driven by external economic and geopolitical factors. While the market faces uncertainty, signs of reduced selling pressure may suggest a possible shift in momentum . Whether this leads to a stronger recovery or an extended period of consolidation remains to be seen.",,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|TRADING,"{'name': 'Coinpaprika', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/80/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaprika,2025-03-13 07:51:17

The apex bank seeks to establish standards for crypto-related services, boost market transparency, and expand investment opportunities for high-net-worth investors. 3-Year Experimental Regime For Crypto Investment In Russia On March 12, the Bank of Russia proposed allowing a ‚Äúlimited circle of Russian investors‚Äù to trade cryptocurrencies. The bank emphasized that the proposal is based on a directive from Russia‚Äôs president Vladimir Putin. ‚ÄúIn accordance with the instructions of the President of Russia, the Bank of Russia has sent proposals to the government for discussion on regulating investments in cryptocurrencies,‚Äù the announcement stated. A statement by the central bank says the plan would introduce an experimental legal regime lasting three years in which qualified investors would be allowed to conduct crypto transactions. Investors who wish to participate in the experimental framework must have over 100 million rubles ($1.14 million) in investments or an annual income of over 50 million rubles ($570,000). Notably, eligibility also extends to institutions that have already satisfied existing qualification standards under the current framework. The Bank of Russia‚Äôs rationale for introducing the new crypto program for select investors came from efforts to establish standards for crypto-related services and increase market transparency while expanding investment opportunities for ‚Äúexperienced investors willing to assume higher risks.‚Äù Bank Of Russia Maintains Ban On Retail Crypto Payments The Bank of Russia reiterated its warnings about the inherent volatility and risks of investing in cryptocurrencies, stressing that any jurisdiction does not guarantee these assets. ‚ÄúTherefore, investors, when deciding to invest in cryptocurrency, should be aware that they are taking on the risks of potential loss of their funds,‚Äù the bank added. Despite the proposal, the Bank of Russia noted that cryptocurrency transactions between residents outside the experimental legal regime are banned. The bank suggested enforcing penalties for violations of the experimental regime. Nonetheless, the move marks Russia‚Äôs latest foray into the crypto space. Last year, the country‚Äôs lower house of the Federal Assembly, known as the State Duma, passed two bills legalizing cryptocurrency mining and enforcing another experimental regime on cross-border settlements and foreign trading in crypto.",Cryptocurrency|News|Cryptocurrency News|Russia,EN,0,0,FIAT|BUSINESS|REGULATION|BTC|MARKET,"{'name': 'ZyCrypto', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/zycrypto.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",zycrypto,2025-03-13 07:53:15

Despite this significant move, Solana‚Äôs price and demand have remained largely unaffected. The crypto market‚Äôs overall bearish sentiment appears to overshadow the potential impact of these token shifts. On-chain data reveals that Alameda‚Äôs unstaked tokens were distributed among 38 wallets linked to FTX , continuing a pattern seen in previous asset transfers by the trading firm. Since its collapse, Alameda has frequently moved substantial amounts of various cryptocurrencies, often influencing prices. However, in this case, Solana‚Äôs price remained stable despite the movement of a large token supply. This stands in contrast to past events where Alameda‚Äôs asset transfers caused noticeable price fluctuations. For example, when the firm moved Ethereum earlier in 2024, ETH experienced a double-digit price jump. Yet, this latest Solana transaction had minimal impact on market dynamics, even as Solana briefly declined and then spiked before the announcement was made. The exact purpose behind these token transfers remains unclear. However, speculation suggests that Alameda may be reallocating assets as part of FTX‚Äôs ongoing reimbursement efforts . Last month, FTX began its first phase of creditor repayments, and earlier this month, the exchange unlocked another massive batch of Solana tokens. If Alameda‚Äôs transfers are connected to this process, they could play a role in restoring funds to affected users. Despite these movements, Solana‚Äôs demand is not expected to shift significantly. The broader crypto market is experiencing extreme fear, leading to substantial outflows from major assets. In this environment, Alameda‚Äôs actions represent just a small fraction of the overall market activity. While the situation continues to unfold, investors are closely watching for any further developments that could influence Solana‚Äôs price and demand. For now, it appears that market conditions and regulatory decisions will have a much larger effect on Solana than Alameda‚Äôs token transfers.",,EN,0,0,SOL|MARKET|TRADING|ETH|BUSINESS,"{'name': 'Coinpaprika', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/80/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaprika,2025-03-13 07:53:50

Dalbon has formally requested an Interpol Red Notice, which would help locate and detain Davis in the U.S. before extraditing him to Argentina. He argues that Davis played a key role in the scandal and could flee due to his wealth and overseas residence. JUST IN: ARGENTINE LAWYER GREGORIO DALBON REQUESTED GLOBAL ACTION AGAINST HAYDEN DAVIS, URGING AN INTERPOL RED NOTICE AMID THE ONGOING $LIBRA TOKEN PROBE ‚Äî BSCN Headlines (@BSCNheadlines) March 13, 2025 The LIBRA Token Collapse & Its Political Fallout LIBRA was a Solana-based meme coin that gained huge attention, especially after Argentine President Javier Milei publicly endorsed it, as local media reported on March 11. However, the hype was short-lived, as the token‚Äôs value crashed within hours, wiping out millions in investor funds. The controversy didn‚Äôt just hit traders‚Äîit also put Milei‚Äôs administration under fire, with critics questioning whether he was part of the scheme or simply misled. Legal Battle Heats Up Dalbon, who has a history of high-profile cases, filed his request with Argentine prosecutor Eduardo Taiano and Judge Mar√≠a Servini. According to local media reports , he stressed Davis‚Äôs involvement in creating and promoting LIBRA, arguing that his freedom posed a serious risk. He accuses him of playing a key role in the scandal that caused massive losses for investors. He even argued in the filing that Davis posed a ‚Äúprocedural risk‚Äù if he is allowed to move freely, with huge financial backing, he could easily escape to the U.S. or go into hiding. Meanwhile, authorities have already taken action to freeze $100 million in crypto linked to the case. If Dalbon‚Äôs request is approved by Interpol, Davis could be arrested in any of the 195 member countries as per the Red Notice rules. However, it‚Äôs important to note that a Red Notice is not an automatic arrest warrant‚Äîeach country decides whether to act based on its own laws. What‚Äôs Next? The LIBRA scandal has rocked Argentina‚Äôs financial and political landscape. Investors lost millions, and the government is facing backlash over its handling of the situation. If Davis is arrested and extradited, it could mark a major step in holding those responsible accountable. But for now, the crypto community and legal experts are watching closely to see what happens next.

41579391,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=139700,1741852503,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Revealing Insights: Tether CEO Reflects on Navigating US Crypto Regulation Challenges,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/tether-ceo-crypto-regulation-challenges/,"In a candid address at the Cantor Global Technology Conference in New York, Tether‚Äôs CEO, Paolo Ardoino, offered a compelling reflection on the stablecoin giant‚Äôs arduous journey. Describing Tether‚Äôs experiences as going ‚Äúthrough hell,‚Äù as reported by CoinDesk, Ardoino‚Äôs words painted a vivid picture of the intense pressures and scrutiny faced by the leading stablecoin issuer, particularly from U.S. authorities. But what exactly are these challenges, and how has Tether navigated the complex landscape of crypto regulation ? Navigating the Labyrinth: Tether‚Äôs Crypto Challenges Under US Regulation Ardoino‚Äôs remarks shed light on the significant headwinds Tether encountered, primarily stemming from the watchful eyes of U.S. regulatory bodies. For years, Tether , the issuer of USDT, has operated under a cloud of skepticism and intense examination. This scrutiny wasn‚Äôt unfounded; the world of stablecoins, designed to maintain a steady value, was relatively new, and its potential impact on the broader financial system was still being understood. Let‚Äôs break down some key aspects of these crypto challenges : Regulatory Scrutiny: From its inception, Tether faced questions about the actual reserves backing its USDT stablecoin. Concerns were raised about whether each USDT was truly backed 1:1 by U.S. dollars or equivalent reserves, as initially claimed. This lack of transparency became a major point of contention with regulators. Legal Battles and Settlements: The pressure culminated in formal investigations and legal actions. Notably, Tether reached settlements with both the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) and the New York State Department of Financial Services (NYDFS) in 2021. These settlements, while resolving specific issues, came with financial penalties and mandates for increased transparency and compliance. Maintaining Stability Amidst Volatility: Beyond regulatory hurdles, Tether also faced the inherent challenge of maintaining USDT‚Äôs peg to the US dollar in the volatile cryptocurrency market. Market fluctuations, especially during periods of high stress, can test the resilience of any stablecoin. Despite these formidable Tether challenges , Ardoino‚Äôs address suggests a turning tide. The settlements with the CFTC and NYDFS, while undoubtedly painful, have arguably paved the way for a more constructive relationship with U.S. regulators. Has Tether successfully weathered the storm and emerged stronger? From Scrutiny to Stability? Understanding US Regulation and Tether‚Äôs Evolution The settlements with the CFTC and NYDFS marked a significant juncture for Tether. These agreements required Tether to pay fines and, more importantly, to enhance its transparency and reporting practices. This shift towards greater openness is crucial for building trust and fostering a more positive regulatory environment. Here‚Äôs a closer look at the impact of US regulation on Tether: Regulatory Body Settlement Outcome Key Impact on Tether Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) $41 million penalty Settlement of charges related to untrue or misleading statements and unlawful off-exchange retail commodity transactions. New York State Department of Financial Services (NYDFS) $18.5 million penalty Settlement related to misrepresentations regarding USDT backing and concealment of losses. Required enhanced reporting and compliance measures. These settlements, while costly, can be viewed as a necessary step in Tether ‚Äòs maturation. By addressing past concerns and committing to greater transparency, Tether is signaling its intent to operate within the bounds of US regulation and build a sustainable future. This evolution is vital not only for Tether but also for the broader stablecoin ecosystem. USDT‚Äôs Reign: Dominance in the Stablecoin Market Despite the regulatory battles and operational hurdles, USDT has not only survived but thrived. Data from DefiLlama underscores USDT‚Äôs undisputed dominance in the stablecoin market . With a staggering market capitalization of $143.5 billion, USDT commands a 63% share of the total stablecoin market cap, which stands at $227.7 billion. This dominance speaks volumes about USDT‚Äôs utility and the market‚Äôs reliance on it as a key instrument in cryptocurrency trading and DeFi (Decentralized Finance). Why does USDT hold such a commanding position in the stablecoin market ? Several factors contribute to its enduring popularity: First-MMover Advantage: USDT was one of the earliest stablecoins, establishing a significant network effect and becoming deeply integrated into crypto exchanges and trading platforms. Liquidity and Accessibility: USDT boasts unparalleled liquidity across numerous exchanges, making it easily accessible for traders worldwide. Its widespread adoption makes it a convenient on-ramp and off-ramp for fiat currencies in the crypto space. Market Familiarity: Years of usage have ingrained USDT into the habits of crypto traders and investors. Despite controversies, its familiarity and ubiquity contribute to its continued preference. However, the stablecoin market is becoming increasingly competitive. Rivals like USDC, backed by Coinbase and Circle, are gaining ground, emphasizing regulatory compliance and transparency as core values. Will USDT be able to maintain its dominant position in the face of rising competition and evolving regulatory landscapes? The Road Ahead: What‚Äôs Next for Tether and the Stablecoin Ecosystem? Paolo Ardoino‚Äôs reflection at the Cantor Global Technology Conference offers a glimpse into Tether‚Äôs past, present, and potentially its future. The journey has been fraught with crypto challenges , particularly concerning US regulation . However, the settlements and the continued market dominance of USDT suggest a degree of resilience and adaptation. Looking ahead, several key factors will shape Tether‚Äôs trajectory and the broader stablecoin market : Evolving Regulation: The regulatory landscape for stablecoins is still in flux globally, especially in the US and Europe. Future regulations could significantly impact how stablecoins operate and are governed. Tether‚Äôs ability to proactively adapt to these changes will be crucial. Transparency and Trust: Continued commitment to transparency regarding reserves and operations will be essential for building and maintaining trust, both with regulators and the market. Competition from Rivals: The rise of competing stablecoins, particularly those emphasizing regulatory compliance, poses a significant challenge to USDT‚Äôs dominance. Innovation and differentiation will be key for Tether to stay ahead. Tether‚Äôs story is a microcosm of the broader cryptocurrency industry‚Äôs journey ‚Äì marked by innovation, rapid growth, regulatory scrutiny, and constant evolution. As the leading stablecoin , Tether‚Äôs future path will undoubtedly have a significant impact on the entire crypto ecosystem.

Ripple‚Äôs XRP finally neared the long-awaited $3 mark after President Donald Trump announced a new U.S. strategic crypto reserve that will include XRP and other digital assets. XRP price is currently up 3.33% to $2.22. If the bullish momentum sustains, XRP could aim at its next resistance levels at $2.31. On the flip side, if it loses out on steam, XRP price will remain range bound between its key support levels at $2.14 and $2.12.

The reason behind this surge could be due to Ripple‚Äôs increasing domination in the payment sector, accelerating XRP‚Äôs buying demand and utility. XRP Price Prediction 2028 In 2028, Ripple could increase its use cases, including new dApps and announcements regarding XRP. This might boost the dominance of XRP as the second largest altcoin by market cap. We expect the XRP price to range between $11.3 to $16.53. The average trading price could be around $14.11. XRP Price Prediction 2029 Partnerships with multiple governments and wider adoption might strengthen XRP‚Äôs price in 2029. The altcoin might record a trading range between $13.98 to $21.12, with an average price of $16.48. XRP Price Prediction 2030 The long-term XRP price prediction depends on Ripple‚Äôs ability to expand its offerings across the crypto market. If everything remains positive, XRP price could scale between $16.92 to $26.97. With that price range, the average tag could be at $19.87.

Imagine an investment that shields you from fluctuations in the next market boom. Will you take it? That‚Äôs exactly what FXGuys ($FXG) gives you despite being in beta. While Solana (SOL) and Sui (SUI) struggle with price tension, FXGuys dominates with its Trader Funding Program, staking model, and Trade2Earn incentives. These features attract all traders looking for lucrative opportunities in the coming market boom. Therefore, its $FXG token is one of the best altcoins to buy in 2025! >>>JOIN FXGUYS HERE FXGuys Outpaces Solana as Investors Target Better Stability Solana is preparing for two major updates that will boost the long-term sustainability of its network. Known as SIMDs 0123 and SIMDs 0228, the proposals focus on regulating reward distribution and managing inflation. The expected changes could have a massive impact on validators and stakeholders within the network, causing SOL price tensions. On the other hand, FTX and Alameda unstaked and distributed 3.03 million SOL , worth $432.5 million, to 37 wallets, possibly indicating deposits to Binance and Coinbase exchanges. This move marks the largest unstaking since November 2023 and is part of 11.2 million SOL set for unlocking in early March 2025. Nevertheless, SOL traded at $147.46 on March 6, 2025, after a 5.88% rise in the last week. FXGuys has dominated Solana with its Trader Funding Program, Trade2Earn model, and high-yield staking, offering unrivaled financial benefits, passive income, and incentivized trading rewards. Investors Move from Sui to FXGuys for Increased Crypto Trading Rewards and Growth Sui has thrived in crypto trading because investors consider it a long-term investment due to its strong Layer 1 blockchain features with enhanced security. Also, the Sui network has an object-focused data model and massive scalability. Despite having a bullish potential and a potential 30% rally, investors are moving to other lucrative assets. Recently, SUI recorded a sharp decline, but investors are rushing to buy the dip, which will help to stabilize the token above its $2.45 support level. For context, SUI was valued at $2.87 on March 6, 2025, down 0.81% in the past week. While Sui remains competitive, investors are worried about the increasing price tension amid market volatility. FXGuys outshines Sui by blending trader funding, Trade2Earn rewards, and high-yield staking, offering real-world financial benefits, unmatched liquidity, and passive income. FXGuys: The New Crypto Project Revolutionizing Trading with Passive Income Opportunities Although Solana and Sui have dominated crypto trading markets for several years, increased volatility and sharp market declines have made investors reconsider their long-term investment strategy. Amid the increased market fluctuations, FXGuys has emerged as a dominant player for investors to consider in the next market boom. The new crypto trading platform offers users instant, real-world financial benefits despite only having a BETA platform and being in its public presale phase. FX Guys has features like the Trader Funding Program, staking model, and Trade2Earn incentives, which attract investors. The FXGuys Trader Funding Program caters to talented and skilled investors who lack the capital to invest in the market. It offers them up to $500,000 in trading capital, which is a unique offering in the whole crypto space. Analysts say the program makes $FXG one of the best altcoins to buy, helping increase investments from retail and institutional investors. Additionally, the FX Guys staking model means significant profits for the whole crypto industry. $FXG token holders get impressive staking rewards (up to a 20% APY) and a revenue share from the platform‚Äôs trading volume and fees. Thus, the investment strategy guarantees a constant flow of passive income for investors. Analysts say the FX Guys Trade2Earn program will change the whole crypto sector since it allows traders to earn $FXG tokens for all executed trades. This strategy enhances liquidity on FX Guys, and the rewards encourage traders to maintain continuous market activity. With the FXGuys BETA trading platform available for anyone seeking a free trial, market experts believe it will accelerate the rate of $FXG adoption. >>>JOIN FXGUYS HERE $FXG Thrives in Its Presale as Investors Seek Profitable Opportunities in a Volatile Market Investors want to maximize their earnings in the next crypto trading market boom as volatility increases. While Solana and Sui struggle with price tensions, FXGuys has stolen the spotlight with its appealing features and growth potential. FXGuys is increasing profitability for traders due to its many remarkable features and trading rewards. On that note, $FXG has become one of the best altcoins to buy, which has attracted many investors looking for more than the usual market speculation. Currently, at $0.05 in Stage 3 of its public presale stage, analysts say it is a cheap buy due to its profit prospects. New investors will enjoy a 100% profit when $FXG hits the mainstream markets at $0.10. Users have already invested over $4.6 million in its presale, meaning investor confidence is growing rapidly.

While five states have dismissed the idea, 18 others continue to explore ways to integrate Bitcoin into their financial systems. Garcia believes that Bitcoin reserves could drive innovation, improve investment frameworks, and enhance financial transparency. He emphasized that many citizens remain skeptical about tax money funding crypto purchases , arguing that states must educate the public on the broader economic benefits of Bitcoin in reserve portfolios. The executive also pointed out that the blockchain industry must demonstrate real-world value beyond speculation. He urged crypto firms to develop solutions that address practical issues, making it harder for lawmakers to ignore their benefits. VeChain‚Äôs blockchain-based sustainability verification was cited as an example of how decentralized technology can tackle pressing global challenges. Despite recent state-level rejections, Garcia cautioned against interpreting these decisions as widespread opposition to Bitcoin reserves. He highlighted that several states rejected the bills by narrow margins, suggesting that further discussion and education could shift opinions in the future. As the debate continues at the state level, momentum is also building on a national scale. Senator Lummis has reintroduced the BITCOIN Act, aiming to establish a US Strategic Bitcoin Reserve , backed by a significant BTC acquisition over five years. Originally proposed in 2024, the bill failed to pass, but recent policy shifts and executive orders suggest renewed interest in integrating Bitcoin into national financial strategies. While the future of Bitcoin reserves remains uncertain, increasing public awareness and addressing legislative concerns could play a crucial role in shaping the next phase of digital asset adoption. With growing interest in blockchain‚Äôs real-world applications, the conversation around Bitcoin as a reserve asset is far from over.",,EN,0,0,BTC|FIAT|BLOCKCHAIN|REGULATION|TECHNOLOGY,"{'name': 'Coinpaprika', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/80/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaprika,2025-03-13 07:58:08

Think of it as a significant power-up for digital freedom! This latest decision involves a substantial crypto funding injection of $4.8 million, building upon an initial investment and highlighting GnosisDAO‚Äôs belief in the future of secure, private internet access. But what exactly does this mean for you, the crypto enthusiast, and the wider digital world? Let‚Äôs dive into the details of this exciting development. Why is GnosisDAO Doubling Down on VPN Development? GnosisDAO isn‚Äôt new to the world of decentralized technologies. Known for its innovative approach and contributions to the blockchain space, GnosisDAO‚Äôs increased investment in VPN development speaks volumes about the growing importance of online privacy. In an age where data breaches and surveillance are increasingly common concerns, the need for robust and user-centric VPN solutions has never been greater. This isn‚Äôt just about hiding your browsing history; it‚Äôs about reclaiming digital sovereignty and ensuring a more secure and open internet for everyone. Here‚Äôs a breakdown of why this investment is a big deal: Privacy is Paramount: With increasing online surveillance and data collection, users are actively seeking tools to protect their digital footprint. A decentralized VPN offers a compelling alternative to traditional VPN services, promising greater transparency and control. Decentralization as a Core Value: GnosisDAO operates on the principles of decentralization. Extending this ethos to VPN technology aligns perfectly with their mission to build a more distributed and resilient digital ecosystem. Synergy with HOPR: The collaboration with HOPR, a leading mixnet developer, brings specialized expertise to the project. HOPR‚Äôs focus on metadata privacy complements GnosisDAO‚Äôs vision for a comprehensive decentralized solution. Long-Term Vision: This isn‚Äôt a short-sighted venture. The additional funding demonstrates GnosisDAO‚Äôs long-term commitment to establishing a viable and impactful decentralized VPN solution within the crypto space and beyond. The Journey So Far: From Seed Funding to Substantial Investment The Gnosis VPN project isn‚Äôt starting from scratch. It began in 2024 with an initial seed investment of $1.5 million from GnosisDAO. This initial capital injection was crucial in laying the groundwork and producing a proof of concept for the Gnosis VPN. Think of it as the initial spark that ignited a promising fire. This early phase allowed the teams at Gnosis and HOPR to: Validate the Concept: Prove the feasibility of a decentralized VPN solution within the Gnosis ecosystem. Establish Collaboration: Forge a strong working relationship between GnosisDAO and HOPR developers. Develop a Proof of Concept: Create a functional prototype to showcase the potential of the Gnosis VPN. The success of this initial phase has paved the way for the much larger $4.8 million investment. This significant increase in crypto funding is a testament to the project‚Äôs early promise and GnosisDAO‚Äôs confidence in its future impact. What Will the New Funding Actually Be Used For? So, where exactly will this $4.8 million go? It‚Äôs not just about throwing money at a problem; it‚Äôs about strategic allocation to ensure maximum impact. The funds are earmarked for several key areas crucial to the successful development and launch of the Gnosis VPN: Technical Research: Deeper exploration into advanced VPN technologies, protocol optimizations, and security enhancements. This ensures the Gnosis VPN is not just functional but also cutting-edge and resilient against evolving threats. User Onboarding Solutions: Making the VPN accessible and user-friendly is paramount for widespread adoption. A portion of the funding will focus on developing intuitive interfaces and streamlined onboarding processes, ensuring even non-technical users can easily benefit from decentralized privacy. HOPR Network Expansion: A robust and geographically diverse network is essential for a high-performance VPN. Expanding the HOPR Network infrastructure will improve speed, reliability, and global coverage of the Gnosis VPN. Furthermore, the agreement includes a strategic element that benefits GnosisDAO in the long run. Gnosis has secured the right to purchase HOPR tokens at a 30% discounted price. This not only represents a potential financial upside but also further aligns the incentives of both GnosisDAO and the HOPR Network , fostering a stronger and more collaborative partnership. Benefits of a Decentralized VPN: Why Should You Care? You might be wondering, ‚ÄúWhy should I care about a decentralized VPN?‚Äù Good question! The traditional VPN market is already quite saturated. However, decentralized VPNs offer some unique and compelling advantages, particularly for those invested in the crypto and Web3 space: Feature Traditional VPN Decentralized VPN (like Gnosis VPN) Transparency Often opaque, with limited insight into server infrastructure and data handling. Built on open-source principles, with greater transparency in network operations and data flows. Censorship Resistance Centralized infrastructure can be targeted by authorities for censorship or shutdown. Distributed nature makes it significantly harder to censor or shut down the entire network. Data Privacy Reliance on a single entity that controls servers and potentially user data. Data is distributed across a network, reducing the risk of centralized data breaches and single points of failure. Trust Model Requires trust in the VPN provider‚Äôs claims about privacy and security. Trust is distributed across the network and verifiable through blockchain and cryptographic principles. Economic Incentives Users pay subscription fees to a centralized provider. Potentially integrates crypto-economic models to incentivize node operators and reward users, creating a more sustainable and community-driven ecosystem. For crypto users, who often prioritize decentralization and privacy in their financial activities, a decentralized VPN like the Gnosis VPN could become an indispensable tool. It aligns with the core values of the crypto space and offers a more robust and resilient approach to online privacy. Challenges Ahead for Gnosis VPN Development While the future looks bright for Gnosis VPN, it‚Äôs important to acknowledge the challenges that lie ahead in its VPN development journey. Building a successful decentralized VPN is not without its hurdles: Scalability: Ensuring the VPN can handle a large number of users and maintain high speeds is a significant technical challenge. Decentralized networks can sometimes face scalability limitations compared to centralized systems. Performance Optimization: Balancing decentralization with optimal VPN performance (speed, latency) requires careful engineering and ongoing optimization. User Education and Adoption: Educating users about the benefits of decentralized VPNs and encouraging adoption will be crucial for the project‚Äôs success. Many users are already familiar with traditional VPNs, so highlighting the unique advantages of a decentralized approach is key. Regulatory Landscape: The regulatory environment surrounding VPNs and decentralized technologies is constantly evolving. Navigating these complexities and ensuring compliance will be an ongoing consideration. However, with the substantial crypto funding now secured and the expertise of both GnosisDAO and HOPR teams, the project is well-positioned to tackle these challenges head-on. The Bottom Line: A Powerful Step Towards Decentralized Privacy GnosisDAO‚Äôs $4.8 million investment in Gnosis VPN development is more than just a financial transaction; it‚Äôs a bold statement about the future of online privacy and the power of decentralized technologies. By doubling down on this project, GnosisDAO is not only contributing to the growth of the HOPR Network and the broader decentralized ecosystem but also taking a significant step towards empowering individuals with greater control over their digital lives. As the project progresses, it will be fascinating to watch how Gnosis VPN shapes the landscape of online privacy and sets a new standard for decentralized solutions in the crypto world and beyond.

Although the cryptocurrency remains below $85,000, it has recorded a 2.6% increase, with its price currently at $83,510. Despite this short-term uptick, Bitcoin is still down by roughly 7.5% over the past week, reflecting a continued downtrend. Regardless of¬†Bitcoin‚Äôs price struggles to regain higher levels, CryptoQuant analyst Avocado Onchain has identified a notable trend in BTC mining activity. Related Reading: Bitcoin‚Äôs SOPR Nears Critical Level‚ÄîIs a Deeper Correction Ahead? Rising Bitcoin Mining Difficulty and Miner Holding Strategy According to Avocado Onchain, Bitcoin‚Äôs mining difficulty has remained in an uptrend even as the market undergoes a 30% correction. The analyst wrote: During the extended correction phase that began in March 2024, mining difficulty saw a temporary drop, leading some to speculate that it resembled the end of the 2021 cycle. However, contrary to those predictions, Bitcoin‚Äôs price rebounded sharply. Although it is now undergoing a ~30% correction, mining difficulty continues to climb. Historically, a decline in mining difficulty has been associated with miners shutting down less efficient rigs, which often signals broader market distress. However, current data, according to Avocado suggests that miners have not yet begun offloading large amounts of Bitcoin, indicating that they are holding onto their reserves rather than selling at lower prices. Another key metric Avocado pointed out is the Miner Position Index (MPI). Previously, this metric showed signs of selling pressure in November 2024. However, this activity did not lead to a significant market downturn, according to the CryptoQuant analyst. Instead, miners appear to be maintaining a holding strategy, suggesting that the broader uptrend remains intact. If Bitcoin‚Äôs correction extends further, a decrease in mining difficulty could be a potential indicator of miner capitulation, but as of now, the network remains resilient. Stablecoin Transfers and Market Absorption In a separate analysis, CryptoQuant analyst Mignolet has observed a surge in the total amount of stablecoin transfers, a trend that typically does not occur while Bitcoin‚Äôs price is declining but rather after a drop, during a market consolidation phase. This suggests that large-scale investors could be absorbing market shocks through over-the-counter (OTC) transactions, reducing the impact of further price declines. Mignolet also noted that increased activity in stablecoin transfers, combined with a rise in active Bitcoin addresses, signals heightened network participation. This pattern has historically indicated spot accumulation, which can serve as a precursor to price recoveries.

The proposal seeks to reduce the asset inflation rate by 80% by moving from a fixed-rate token emission to a market-based model. Over the past week, mixed views circulated on digital asset spaces. At the time of writing, proponents have secured the necessary quorum (71.85%) in favor. Validators Lambast Possible Risks Crypto enthusiast Dave wrote on X that the move will favor larger validators over smaller players. He added that this will lead to high centralization and a scenario where the rich get richer. Solana validator SolBlaze.org noted that SIMD-0228 threatens Solana‚Äôs decentralization and the wider ecosystem. While it sounds good in theory, presently, the fixed 15% inflation decrease will be taken to extreme levels. According to the validator, rewards will plunge up to 80% with users looking for better yield. This reduced stake affects network security and disproportionately affects small validators. These network participants at 0% interest maintain servers and get block fees. Furthermore, Solana Foundation President Lily Liu described the proposal as half-baked, pointing to the benefits of a predictable capital market. She added that infrastructure remains the foundation of most networks and needs a certain level of stability. ‚Äú What‚Äôs the greater risk and cost to our ecosystem: overpaying for security, or underinvesting in growth? On security: we were dogged for years as the centralized VC chain. We finally overcame that. But now we have 228 which is a VC proposal that centralizes the network! On growth: we‚Äôve achieved impressive growth ‚Äì and we need to continue to invest. Other ecosystems have noticed our ascent and are gearing up to compete,‚Äù Lui wrote. Solana‚Äôs Co-founder Backs The Proposal Solana‚Äôs co-founder Anatoly Yakovenko backed the proposal, allaying the decentralization concerns. In an X post, he explained that the cost of inflation hitting $1-$2 billion annually will spark losses for small validators and wealth managers. Another argument for the proposal is the incentive for participation to secure the network while inflation drops. Per the release , higher inflation drives centralization. On the other hand, low inflation fuels Solana‚Äôs decentralized finance ( DeFi ) presence. ‚Äú Additionally, a high staking rate can be viewed as unhealthy for new DeFi protocols, since it means the implied hurdle rate is the inflation cost. Lowering the ‚Äúrisk-free‚Äù inflation rate creates stimulative conditions and allows new protocols to grow.‚Äù",Cryptocurrency|News|SOL|Solana,EN,0,0,SOL|MARKET|REGULATION,"{'name': 'ZyCrypto', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/zycrypto.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",zycrypto,2025-03-13 08:01:50

The large-cap altcoin, with a fully diluted valuation of about $18.8 billion and a 24-hour average trading volume of around $935 million, pumped over 11 percent in the past 24 hours to retest a crucial resistance level of around $1.72. Although the Open Mainnet is still in its infancy stage of mainstream adoption, the Pi network has remained relevant against all odds. Moreover, Pi coin has been the top trending digital asset on Coingecko in the past few consecutive days. Pi Coin Price Prediction As Coinpedia previously stated, Pi Price has been battling with bearish sentiment in the past two weeks as early adopters accelerate profit-taking. Moreover, early adopters of the Pi network, currently amounting to over 60 million, have been waiting for the token listing for the past six years. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Pi Network‚Äôs 82.8 Billion Token Control Raises Decentralization Concerns , However, Pi price flashed a bullish signal after rebounding over 11 percent in the past 24 hours to retest the neckline of a prior head and shoulders (H&S) pattern . From a technical analysis standpoint, Pi price must consistently close above the resistance level around $1.8 to invalidate further market correction. Furthermore, the four-hour Relative Strength Index (RSI) rebounded from the 70 percent level earlier today and dropped to 58 percent at the time of this writing. However, if Pi coin consistently closes below the resistance level around $1.8, a macro reversal pattern will be confirmed with a midterm target of around $1.2 in the coming weeks. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

This plan aims to guard traders from extreme market swings giving them a more steady and safe trading experience. But how does this fund help the typical crypto trader at a time when Bitcoin has dropped under $83k? Understanding LBank‚Äôs Futures Risk Protection Fund Price swings are a normal part of crypto trading, and quick price jumps can lead to forced sell-offs that put traders at a loss. LBank‚Äôs new fund tries to fight these sudden market shifts, giving users money protection when they face losses due to big price changes. The fund kicks in during what LBank calls ‚Äúwick events‚Äù ‚Äì times when the K-line price moves more than 2% away from the fair market price in just one minute before bouncing back. The protection covers the top 100 futures trading pairs, including Bitcoin (BTC) , Ethereum (ETH) , and Solana (SOL) making sure it includes a wide range of high-liquidity assets. How Traders Benefit Compensation for Losses ‚Äì Traders affected by forced liquidation or stop-loss triggers due to price spikes will receive 120% of their losses. This compensation is credited in USDT to their spot accounts within 48 hours, reducing the financial strain caused by sudden market movements. Additional Airdrop Rewards ‚Äì In addition to individual compensation, LBank will allocate an extra 10,000 USDT whenever a price spike occurs. This amount is proportionally distributed to all position holders of the affected trading pair, further rewarding active traders. Market Stability and Trust ‚Äì LBank‚Äôs creation of this fund shows its dedication to fair trading and market integrity. This move helps lower the risks linked to rapid trading and sudden market changes What Sets This Fund Apart? Unlike traditional insurance mechanisms, LBank‚Äôs approach ensures rapid and transparent settlements using USDT, simplifying the process for traders. With over 15 million users worldwide, the platform is leveraging its strong market presence to introduce a safety net that enhances user confidence and trading continuity. Moreover, by integrating data from the top five derivatives platforms listed on CoinMarketCap, LBank ensures that compensation decisions are based on market-wide consensus rather than internal pricing models. This level of transparency sets a new standard in risk protection for futures traders. The Bigger Picture: A Safer Futures Market While there are several hacks happening across the globe as the hype around top cryptos like Bitcoin and the rest intensifies, crypto futures trading also has major risks.

However, with the rise of DuragDoge also known as the DOGE killer, it seems investors have already made their choice regarding the crypto coin to invest in. This top NFT coin has attracted a large number of savvy investors with its unique tale that every trader can relate to. There are a lot of meme coin projects that come with so many promises but don‚Äôt deliver much at the end of the day. $DURAG has come to change the narrative by combining the fun of memes with the usefulness of a crypto coin. Read on to find out why XRP and DOGE seem to be losing investors to the $DURAG crypto trading project. The Ripple (XRP) Ecosystem Faces More Bearish Tendencies In a recent tweet, a popular crypto analyst pointed out that XRP‚Äôs daily chart was making a head-and-shoulders shape. This is a scientific sign that prices are going down, and it usually comes before big drops. Notably, this negative outlook comes at a time when XRP and the crypto market as a whole are going through new chaos, just one day after a huge price increase. After selling at $1.96 two days before, XRP got close to $3 on Sunday. But XRP has dropped more than 18% and is now worth only $2.23. Taking this into account, the crypto expert said that if XRP falls below $2 again, bigger drops might be on the way. Dogecoin (DOGE) On The Path For a Rebound A classic cup-and-handle design has formed, which could mean that Dogecoin is going to go up in price. This type of basic analysis usually shows a period of building up before a breakout. The crypto trading market has been in a bear market since May 2021, when it hit its all-time high. The chart pattern shows a rounded bottom that lasts until late 2023. Recently, the price responded positively by breaking above a trendline that had been going down since early 2024. It reached a high of $0.2408 before corrective action pushed it back down to $0.1934, a 19.28% drop in one session. This pullback could be seen as a good test of the breakout zone, which could lead to a future rally-up. If Dogecoin stays above the support levels of $0.18 and $0.19, it could build steam toward higher resistance levels, which could mean big gains for traders. But whatever gains DOGE has in store for its investors can not be compared to the massive gains $DURAG offers as a top NFT coin. DuragDoge ($DURAG): The New Crypto Project Known As The DOGE Killer When traders talk about the best crypto to invest in 2025, they refer to no other crypto project than the DuragDoge project. The rich hustle culture at DuragDoge has emerged to shake up the market because it combines community culture with new ideas all tailored to making traders win. For meme coin fans who are always looking for new opportunities to explore in crypto trading, having $DURAG on your side would be the best way to make huge gains this year. In addition to a relatable story, this top NFT coin has a lot of useful features that can put you on a new path of profiting in crypto trading. As of right now, the presale for $DURAG is live, and experts are already calling it the best crypto to invest in for huge returns this 2025. The price of one $DURAG token is $0.0009, currently at the lowest price it can ever be. This was put in place by the founders of DuragDoge so that every crypto trader, both billionaires and beginners alike, can have access to join this next crypto boom. Summary While XRP and DOGE fight to keep their portfolios in green, the $DURAG crypto project is stressless surging in its presale, constantly hitting new marks. Smart investors have gotten on board with this new project as they are convinced that $DURAG is the best crypto to invest in right now. Join the $DURAG presale and make 100x gains today!

On-chain data indicated that 356,665 coins were sold recently, a converse action to the current market cool-down. In response, traders and investors speculate whether it is possible for LINK price to hit $45 ahead, as the coin is already up 2% in the past 24 hours despite the selloff. Chainlink Whale Selloff: 356K Token Dump Ignites Caution According to an X post by Onchain Lens on March 13, a Chainlink whale sold 356,665 coins for $4.59 million USDC at an average price of $12.88. Per the data, the whale address ‚Äò0xc6f7f‚Äô was recorded as making the selloff transaction. For context, colossal selloffs by whales signal a loss of confidence in an asset‚Äôs potential for gains. In turn, traders and investors reckon a poor market performance ahead. Besides, it‚Äôs also noteworthy that the sell order may be due to a panic-selling sentiment prevailing across the market at present. Traders and investors reflect a cautious approach to risk assets amid severe macro heat. Nevertheless, the Chainlink whale still holds 7,693 LINK tokens, worth $101,533. The undermined existing holding indicates that the trader may not be confident about gains ahead but still hopes for a best-case scenario wherein the price recovers from the broader volatility. Crypto Market Today However, the crypto market appears to be easing pressure as the latest U.S. CPI data revealed cooling inflation. In turn, BTC and major-league altcoins prevented further downside price risk today. Simultaneously, LINK price also eased up, witnessing slight intraday gains and reflecting resilience. Yet, market participants remain uncertain over future movements as the selloff indicates a dip while broader developments could conversely uplift the market sentiment. LINK Price Soars Despite Whale Selloff As of press time, LINK price witnessed gains worth 2% intraday and closed at $13.15. It bottomed and peaked at $12.82 and $13.77 over the past day. The coin is currently rising in sync with today‚Äôs broader crypto market trend. Top Analyst Weighs Bullish Remarks On Chainlink Simultaneously, renowned market analyst ‚ÄòBitcoin Buddha‚Äô took to X, projecting bullishness over future movements despite the massive selloff. As per the analyst‚Äôs post and price chart, Chainlink ‚Äúseems to be recovering after testing support near $12.‚Äù This paves the way for further gains and thus, a new ATH if recovery sustains, per the analyst. Source: Bitcoin Buddha, X On the other hand, a LINK price prediction by CoinGape revealed that the technical chart on the token‚Äôs weekly time frame shows a bullish engulfing pattern. This formation suggests a strong momentum that favors buyers. Overall, the abovementioned dynamics indicated that the coin could pump ahead despite the massive selloff. On the other hand, another report revealed that a $45 price target remains possible as long as Chainlink holds a key support zone between $6 and $9. Crypto market traders and investors continue to thoroughly monitor the token amid broader trends impacting the market.

Analysts predict further upside potential. Speculation is mounting about a potential Binance listing on March 14, while Gemini has hinted at a major announcement on March 13, fueling anticipation within the PI community. PI Outperforms the Leaders Pi Network‚Äôs native token saw the light of day on February 20, and since then, it has experienced significant volatility. The price surpassed $1.80 on launch day, but it tanked below $0.65 mere days later. The bulls retook control towards the end of February, and the valuation hit an all-time high of almost $3. The ongoing month has offered more turbulence, with PI dipping below $1.30 on March 9. However, that marked a local bottom, and currently, the price is worth approximately $1.70 (per CoinGecko‚Äôs data), representing a 15% increase on a daily scale. PI Price, Source: CoinGecko The coin‚Äôs resurgence coincides with a slight rebound of the entire cryptocurrency market. However, PI has outperformed most of the top 100 digital assets in terms of daily gains. Bitcoin (BTC), for instance, is up 2% for the day, whereas Ripple (XPR) has climbed by 3% for that timeframe. According to some industry participants, PI has much more room for growth. The X user JAVON MARKS recently claimed that the price chart seems to have formed ‚Äúa bullish Falling Wedge pattern breakout‚Äù that might be followed by a bull run to fresh peaks. ‚ÄúPrices could be set for an over 72% increase back close to the $3 mark,‚Äù the analyst predicted. The Approaching Pi Day Pi Network will celebrate its sixth birthday on March 14 . The date also symbolizes the mathematical constant œÄ (pi), which is approximately 3.14. Recently, there have been increased rumors that Binance might list PI that day. In February, the world‚Äôs largest crypto exchange held a community vote to determine whether its users would want to see PI available for trading. Over 86% of the voters clicked the ‚Äúyes‚Äù option, but PI remains unavailable on the platform. A potential listing will increase the coin‚Äôs liquidity and accessibility and could trigger upward pressure on the price. Historically, support from Binance has resulted in substantial rallies for the involved cryptocurrencies. Meanwhile, the US-based crypto exchange Gemini might also hop on the bandwagon. Earlier this week, the company prepared the community for big news that is about to be announced on March 13 . Some users commenting on the post suggested that the listing of PI could be the upcoming development. The well-known exchanges that have already embraced Pi Network‚Äôs native token include Bitget, Gate.io, MEXC, OKX, and more.

Although the BTC price managed to reclaim levels above $83,000, the real excitement lies around the XRP price. The token has demonstrated a strong comeback after visiting lows below $2, which manifests growing bullish momentum around the token. One of the major reasons for the downfall of the XRP price , which also restricted the rally from marking a new ATH during the 2021 bull run, was the ongoing lawsuit against Ripple. The delisting from the US-based exchanges has made some of the market participants uncertain over the next price action. Meanwhile, the price could trigger a strong bullish action soon as some reports suggest these uncertain clouds over Ripple are expected to fade away. As per some insider reports, the case is in the process of wrapping up. We have seen the SEC closing the investigation and lawsuits over various crypto platforms in the past couple of weeks. And the delay with Ripple is speculated to be over the fine of $125 million imposed by the SEC and the permanent injunction preventing the company from selling XRP to institutional investors. Despite the bullish sentiments surrounding it, the XRP price is facing some bearish pressure as it fails to surpass pivotal resistance after a rebound. The latest rebound, however, invalidated the H&S pattern, but the price failed to rise above $2.28, which raises some concerns. Meanwhile, the RSI is incremental regardless of a minor divergence. On the other hand, the Ichimoku cloud is preparing for a bullish crossover and as a result, the price is expected to maintain a range-bound consolidation between $2.03 and $2.27. Once the price rises above the range, it may continue to test the higher targets. With the speculation of the closure of the Ripple vs. SEC lawsuit, the traders are expected to become optimistic over the next price action. Besides, the platform is creating a DFSA license to enable blockchain-powered crypto payments while Franklin Templeton joins the race for XRP ETF along with Grayscale, Wisdomtree, etc. and others.

An ECB working paper on ‚ÄúConsumer attitudes towards a central bank digital currency,‚Äù which surveyed about 19,000 respondents across 11 euro-area countries, highlighted significant communication challenges that are discouraging European households from adopting the digital euro. When asked to hypothetically allocate 10,000 euros (roughly $10,800) across various assets, Europeans allocated only a small portion to the digital euro, having little impact on traditional liquid assets like cash, current accounts or savings accounts. Reasons for not adopting a digital euro for retail payments. Source: European Central Bank According to the March 12 ECB working paper, Europeans have a strong preference for existing payment methods and see no real benefit in a new type of payment system amid myriads of offline and online alternatives: ‚ÄúThis finding also suggests that convincing some users of the value added of a CBDC might pose a challenge for policymakers, and more research will certainly be needed in this area.‚Äù The study suggested that while a digital euro could be introduced with minimal disruption to financial stability, its adoption faces significant hurdles due to consumer habits. Additionally, it stressed the importance of targeted communication to address persistent consumer reluctance toward a digital euro. Post-treatment attention checks conducted on European respondents. Source: ECB The ECB paper found that European consumers were receptive to video-based education and training and concluded that educating the masses with CBDC-related video information could help with the widespread adoption of the digital euro: ‚ÄúWe find evidence that consumers who are shown a short video providing concise and clear communication about the key features of the digital euro are substantially more likely to update their beliefs about this new form of payment, which, in turn, increases their immediate likelihood of adopting it compared to an untreated control group.‚Äù Related: European lawmakers silent on US Bitcoin reserve amid digital euro push The study‚Äôs release comes as US lawmakers intensify their opposition to CBDCs.

The impact of the withdrawals saw a slight dip in SOL‚Äôs price by 1.2% within the first hour, plummeting to $122.25 at 11:30 a.m. UTC.

On March 12, a crypto investor walked away with $1.8 million and forced the Hyperliquidity Pool (HLP) to bear a $4 million loss after a trade that used leverage on the Hyperliquid decentralized exchange (DEX). The trader used about 50x leverage to turn $10 million into a $270 million Ether ( ETH ) long position. However, the trader couldn‚Äôt exit without tanking their own position. Instead, they withdrew collateral, offloading assets without triggering a self-inflicted price drop, leaving Hyperliquid to cover the losses. Smart contract auditor Three Sigma said the trade was a ‚Äúbrutal game of liquidity mechanics,‚Äù not a bug or an exploit. Hyperliquid also clarified that this was not a protocol exploit or a hack. Source: Hyperliquid Hyperliquid lowers leverage trading for BTC and ETH In response to the trade, Hyperliquid lowered its Bitcoin ( BTC ) leverage to 40x and its ETH leverage allowance to 25x. This increases the maintenance margin requirements for larger positions on the DEX. ‚ÄúThis will provide a better buffer for backstop liquidations of larger positions,‚Äù Hyperliquid stated. In an X post, the Bybit CEO commented on the trade, saying that CEXs are also subjected to the same situation. Zhou said their liquidation engine takes over whale positions when they get liquidated. While lowering the leverage may be an effective solution, Zhou said this could be bad for business: ‚ÄúI see that HP has already lowered their overall leverage; that‚Äôs one way to do it and probably the most effective one, however, this will hurt business as users would want higher leverage.‚Äù Zhou suggested a more dynamic risk limit mechanism that reduces the overall leverage as the position grows. The executive said that in a centralized platform, the whale would go down to a leverage of 1.5x with the huge amount of open positions. Despite this, the executive recognized that users could still use multiple accounts to achieve the same results. The Bybit CEO added that even the lowered leverage capabilities could still be ‚Äúabused‚Äù unless the DEX implements risk management measures such as surveillance and monitoring to spot ‚Äúmarket manipulators‚Äù on the same level as a CEX.

LIBRA, which received Milei‚Äôs support, caused many investors to be victimized. While investors received support from the cryptocurrency sector, an Argentinian lawyer requested a red notice from Interpol for the LIBRA token partner. Argentinian lawyer Gregorio Dalbon has requested a global arrest warrant for Hayden Davis, co-creator of the LIBRA token that has caused a political scandal in the country. The lawyer suggested that the LIBRA creator might have obstructed the investigation by leaving the US. Dalbon submitted his request to the prosecutor and judge investigating President Javier Milei‚Äôs connection to the controversial memecoin LIBRA, which reached a market value of $4.5 billion before its collapse. Dalbon said there was a procedural risk if Davis was not arrested and released because he would have access to large amounts of money that would allow him to flee the United States or go into hiding. ‚ÄúDavis‚Äô actions from LIBRA‚Äôs creation through its collapse and the profits from the founding accounts indicate a possible pattern of behavior aimed at defrauding investors by using his connections to Javier Milei and Karina Milei, high-ranking officials in the Argentine government. Given the magnitude of the scandal and the significant losses suffered by investors, it is clear that Hayden Mark Davis's continued release carries procedural risk. His central role in the creation and promotion of the LIBRA cryptocurrency, combined with the international impact of the case, raises the possibility that he will step in to escape the clutches of justice.‚Äù Argentine President Javier Milei has shared many posts about the Solana (SOL)-based LIBRA token. Milei first shared a promotional tweet about the token from his official account, but after the price of the LIBRA token crashed, he deleted his tweet, claiming that he had no connection with the token. He then retweeted a tweet explaining how to buy LIBRA tokens. *This is not investment advice.

The analyst pseudonymously known as Rekt Capital tells his 542,500 followers on the social media platform X that the heavy selling that Bitcoin has experienced over the past couple of weeks is about to end. ‚ÄúIt has been a seller-dominated market over the past two weeks, with above-average seller volume being a daily occurrence. However, there‚Äôs been declining seller volume over this period. This should contribute to seller exhaustion sooner than later.‚Äù Source: Rekt Capital The pseudonymous analyst further says that Bitcoin could bottom out if the Relative Strength Index (RSI) indicator on the weekly time frame maintains a support level that stretches back to early 2024. The RSI, a momentum oscillator used to determine oversold or overbought conditions, is calibrated between 0 and 100 with a reading of or below 30 indicating oversold conditions and a reading of or above 70 suggesting overbought conditions. ‚ÄúThe last few times that Bitcoin dropped into RSI=44 (blue), the price didn‚Äôt bottom right away but was very close to the ultimate bottom.

Despite everything, investors view it as a potential coin after Bitcoin, Ethereum, and others. Just three months ago, the BNB token set an ATH of $793.35 and has struggled to accomplish the same level ever since. Interestingly, the token has begun to recover amid investor demand, collaborations, and, more significantly. Binance Coin Price Surge 15% Past Crash, 6% Today Amid the broader crypto market crash, the BNB price also struggled as it hit the bottom at $511.85. However, the last 48 hours are different as the token nearly surged 15% since then and 6% today, settling at $580.88 with a market capitalization of $82.75B and trading volume of $1.84B. Although this is nowhere near its prime and requires a 30% rally to $793.35, the investors‚Äô confidence is building with the recent recovery. More importantly, the MGX investment is likely to fuel its rally further, per Binance Coin price predictions . Why is the Binance Coin Price Rising in the First Place? The biggest reason behind the BNB price recovery is MGX‚Äôs $2 billion investment in the crypto exchange. MGX, the Abu Dhabi-based AI and advanced technology investor, has made the single biggest investment in a crypto company (Binance). Additionally, it is the largest investment paid in stabelcoins, fueling investor sentiments. This investment is a significant step for developing the blockchain and digital assets ecosystem. As a result, the demand for the BNB surged, with the 24-hour trading volume rising to $1.84B, Open Interest increasing nearly 6% to $734.93 million, and Options Open Interest rising 19.79%, reaching $11.96 million. Overall, these Coinglass metrics reveal increased participation from institutional and retail investments, fueling BNB price growth. In addition, the increased long positions reveal investors‚Äô confidence in the token. Also, the shorts liquidation is building the buying pressure and bullish momentum. The broader crypto market recovery has also played a role, fueled by the Bitcoin price surge amid the US CPI data release. What‚Äôs Next? The Binance Coin price surge is backed by strong derivative market activity and investors‚Äô bullish sentiments. This could fuel the price rally further in an optimistic scenario, primarily as analysts see the bullish flag formation. However, things can take a different turn with market volatility and Hyperliquid controversy , as people alleged that Binance is trying to wipe out the decentralized perpetual exchange.

Tougher Regulations The new law, introduced as LB 609 by Senator Eliot Bostar on January 22, establishes stricter licensing requirements for crypto ATM and kiosk operators. Businesses running these machines must now obtain a license under Nebraska‚Äôs Money Transmitters Act, secure approval from the Department of Banking and Finance, and submit detailed quarterly reports on their locations, owners, and transaction activities. The legislation also caps daily transaction limits‚Äî$2,000 for new users and $5,000 for existing customers‚Äîto curb large-scale fraudulent transactions. Additionally, fees charged by crypto ATMs cannot exceed 18% of the transaction value, a move designed to prevent excessive surcharges. To further protect users, the bill mandates clear fraud warnings on ATMs, requires kiosk operators to appoint compliance officers, and introduces a refund mechanism for fraud victims. New users who report fraud within 90 days can receive a full refund, including transaction fees. Existing customers can reclaim any fees lost due to fraudulent transactions. Crypto ATM Fraud Soars The crackdown comes in response to alarming fraud statistics reported by the Federal Trade Commission (FTC). Victims lost over $65 million to crypto ATM scams in just the first half of 2024, and losses at Bitcoin ATMs (BTMs) have skyrocketed nearly tenfold since 2020, according to an FTC report from September. Nebraska‚Äôs move follows a national trend of heightened scrutiny on crypto ATMs . Just earlier this month, over 1,200 ATMs were removed across the U.S. after Illinois Senator Dick Durbin pushed for similar regulations. Notably, Nebraska has yet to join the 21 U.S. states considering official crypto reserves , a move that could further cement its position as a digital asset hub.

The company reported that there is growing demand for cross-border payments throughout the Middle East, not just from crypto-native firms but also from traditional financial institutions. OKX also achieved a major milestone by obtaining a MiFID II license in the EU, allowing it to offer crypto derivatives to institutional investors. Meanwhile, Gemini expanded US dollar payment support for European institutions through a partnership with Bank Frick, simplifying fiat transactions for institutional clients. Ripple Expands in the UAE Ripple secured full regulatory approval from the Dubai Financial Services Authority (DFSA) to provide cross-border crypto payment services in the United Arab Emirates. The company announced on March 13 that it officially received its DFSA license, which allows it to operate in the Dubai International Financial Center (DIFC), a key financial hub with its own regulatory framework and tax policies. This milestone took place after Ripple‚Äôs in-principle approval , which it announced almost six months earlier on Oct. 1 of 2024, as part of its strategic push to establish a presence in the UAE‚Äôs digital asset ecosystem. With the newly granted license, Ripple can now offer blockchain-based payment solutions to businesses across the UAE, targeting financial institutions looking for partners to integrate digital assets into real-world applications. The company reported growing demand for cross-border payments throughout the Middle East, not just from crypto-native firms but also from traditional financial institutions. According to Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse, the UAE is well-positioned to benefit from technological and crypto innovation due to the region‚Äôs progressive regulatory landscape and its commitment to encouraging a supportive environment for digital asset companies. He also pointed out that the crypto industry is entering a period of expansion, driven by increasing regulatory clarity and institutional adoption around the world. The approval makes Ripple the first blockchain-enabled payments provider to operate in DIFC‚Äôs free zone. DIFC CEO Arif Amiri welcomed the development, and stated that Ripple‚Äôs regulatory achievement reinforces Dubai‚Äôs role as a key player in the global fintech and digital asset landscape. Overall, the license allows Ripple to explore new opportunities across the UAE and the broader MENA region. OKX Secures EU License to Offer Crypto Derivatives OKX also recently reached a big regulatory milestone in the European Union by acquiring a Markets in Financial Instruments Directive (MiFID II) license that will allow the exchange to offer derivatives trading products to institutional investors across the region. Crypto derivatives are financial contracts that derive their value from an underlying cryptocurrency, like Bitcoin or Ethereum. They allow traders to speculate on price movements without owning the actual asset. Common types of crypto derivatives usually include futures, options, and perpetual contracts. The announcement was made on March 12 by OKX‚Äôs Europe CEO, Erald Ghoos. This development happened after the company‚Äôs earlier preauthorization under the Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA) framework, which allows it to provide localized services across 28 markets in the European Economic Area. While MiFID II and MiCA serve different regulatory purposes, they complement each other in the crypto industry. MiFID II governs all financial instruments, including crypto derivatives, and requires platforms offering these products to register. Meanwhile, MiCA is focused on crypto-asset service providers dealing with cryptocurrencies that are not classified as financial instruments. OKX‚Äôs acquisition of the MiFID II license positions it to cater to institutional investors looking to engage in the growing crypto derivatives market. OKX is headquartered in Seychelles, and is one of the world‚Äôs largest crypto exchanges by daily trading volume. On March 12 alone, the exchange processed close to $3.7 billion in spot trades, according to CoinMarketCap. Crypto derivatives data (Source: CCData ) The demand for crypto derivatives surged as institutional interest in digital assets continues to rise. A report from CCData in November estimated the centralized crypto derivatives market at almost $7 trillion, which was an 89.4% increase compared to the previous peak in March of last year. A February 2024 report by EY shed some light on how decentralized finance is evolving and its role in shaping the crypto derivatives sector, despite regulatory scrutiny after the 2022 downturn that led to many high-profile bankruptcies . Europe has been recognized as a key region for crypto derivatives trading. While derivatives trading is a focal point, the broader cryptocurrency market in Europe is also expanding. According to CME Group , Europe accounts for close to 18% of global cryptocurrency transaction volumes, making it the second-largest digital asset economy worldwide. OKX‚Äôs regulatory approval places it in a strong position to capitalize on this growing market. Share of crypto transaction value by region (Source: CME Group ) Gemini Expands US Dollar Support for European Institutions Gemini, the crypto exchange that was founded by Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss, is expanding its services for institutional clients in Europe by introducing US dollar payment support . The company announced a partnership with Liechtenstein-based Bank Frick to enable US dollar payment rails for institutional customers in the United Kingdom and Switzerland. There are also plans to extend the service to European Union institutional clients in the coming weeks. Additionally, the new functionality will be available to institutional users in Gibraltar, Jersey, Guernsey, and the Isle of Man. With this feature, institutions will be able to deposit and withdraw US dollars from their Gemini accounts without fees and directly trade crypto with US dollars. This eliminates the need for conversion into British pounds or euros. Gemini‚Äôs head of Europe, Mark Jennings, pointed out that as institutional adoption of crypto continues to grow, having direct US dollar access will provide a much more seamless trading experience. To facilitate these transactions, Gemini will use Bank Frick‚Äôs xPulse instant transfer service, which offers a 24/7 fiat on-ramp for institutional customers with a Bank Frick bank account. The functionality will be available directly on the Gemini platform through its own entities that hold Electronic Money Institution (EMI) licenses. Unlike many other crypto asset service providers that depend on partnerships for funding rails, Gemini‚Äôs regulatory-first approach allows it to offer direct funding solutions. It is still unclear how widespread US dollar trading support is among other European crypto exchanges, though Coinbase introduced similar trading pairs for European customers in 2019 before halting its Pro service in 2023. (Source: Bloomberg ) The expansion comes amid reports that Gemini confidentially filed for an initial public offering in the United States. According to sources from Bloomberg , the IPO could take place as early as this year, and could involve major financial institutions like Goldman Sachs and Citigroup. Gemini has been pursuing a public listing since at least 2021 and previously explored a merger with the now-bankrupt venture capital firm Digital Currency Group.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,FIAT|TRADING|MARKET|EXCHANGE|BUSINESS,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-03-13 09:25:21

Apart from Bitcoin, Davinci Jeremie gained fame from his 2011 Bitcoin call. He now believes SHIB faces its potential growth through Shibarium‚Äôs layer-2 network that approaches $1 billion in activity. The daily chart of SHIB displays contradictory indicators since it shows a rounding bottom pattern yet indicates bearish momentum signals. The meme coin rises 2% to $0.0000124 while declining RSI and MACD signals reflect doubts among investors. The crypto market strategic moment is transformed by the emerging project MUTM (Mutuum Finance) which attracts investor attention through its features instead of speculative plans. Shiba Inu‚Äôs Crossroads The SHIB supply reduction through burning is possible according to Jeremie because Shibarium will gain more utility through widespread adoption. Yet technical barriers loom. The token will need to exceed the resistance point of $0.000033 to validate a trend reversal in its price action which spans beyond its current market value by 165%. The combination of unfavorable economic conditions together with market distrust remains an uncertainty. The marketplace of retail investors who propelled SHIB in past months has shifted its behavior toward caution as market conditions remain unstable. The upcoming expansion of layer-2 blockchain generates speculation but its precise effect on SHIB‚Äôs upcoming performance remains visually difficult to forecast. Mutuum Finance Presale Accelerates SHIB faces market uncertainties but MUTM stands out among presale projects while building its investor base on the third phase. Much like its predecessors the third phase received $3.1 million worth of investment which brought a total of 5,300 holders to Mutuum Finance‚Äôs tokenomics structure. The current price of $0.02 allows investors to achieve a 25% increase before phase four receives an update to $0.025. The early phase investment leads to potential double the initial amount initially paid with the upcoming exchange listing value at $0.06 which remains clear through allocation transparency. Research analysts believe that MUTM will increase to $3.50 by 2025 after its launch which will result in a 17,400% growth from its initial price of $0.02. Sustainable Demand Mechanics Mutuum Finance stands apart from competitors by creating controlled purchasing demands. The platform system uses revenue from platform activities to buy MUTM tokens continuously which are then distributed to staking participants. The protocol works to stop market downfalls yet it stimulates investors to maintain their tokens for extended periods unlike popular meme-based coins that thrive based on social interactions. Stability takes precedence in the ecosystem because of its overcollateralized lending pools and dynamic interest rates design alongside perpetual buy pressure mechanisms. komunikator: The rapid adoption in Phase Three reveals that investors seize this opportunity since they understand they must buy tokens right away before value increases and exchange additions boost market demand. Timing the Opportunity The crypto market now actively wants projects that unite useful features with enhanced scalability. The presale process of Mutuum Finance indicates the market shift as it shows strong progress in its current stage. The upcoming phase four entry point with its higher requirement establishes $0.02 as the essential purchase price. Data from previous token events reveals that buy-back tokens accompanied by swift presales tend to generate superior performance after launch especially when exchange availability happens simultaneously with platform enhancements. Smart investors chose to allocate funds into MUTM presale as the initial $1,000 investment can generate returns of $35,000 when MUTM increases to $3.50. The outcome of Shiba Inu depends heavily on layer-2 adoption and market feeling yet Mutuum Finance has more predictable direction. The platform builds resistance against cryptocurrency fluctuations by collecting both customer demand during its pre-release period along with operating on an autonomous token economy model. Phase three approaches its maximum capacity so the only thing left to determine is speed of implementation. The official portal from Mutuum Finance offers a platform to acquire tokens before upcoming market movements.

The president listed five assets for the reserve, including XRP, promoting discussions about which asset could be at the forefront. Uphold, a digital asset platform that backs XRP, asked the crypto community this question on X: Should the U.S. leverage XRP‚Äôs escrow model, or is Bitcoin‚Äôs fixed supply the better option? Could the U.S. leverage #XRP ‚Äôs escrow model for its crypto reserve? Or is #Bitcoin ‚Äôs fixed supply the better play? What‚Äôs your take? $XRP #XRPArmy #XRPHolders #XRPCommunity #XRPL #Ripple ‚Äî Uphold (@UpholdInc) March 12, 2025 XRP‚Äôs Escrow Model and Institutional Suitability XRP‚Äôs escrow system provides a structured release of tokens over time, which some believe could offer stability and predictability for a government-managed reserve. One commenter emphasized that Bitcoin‚Äôs adoption has been limited to specific groups. He argued that XRP is ‚Äúthe only option for global banks.‚Äù Another pointed out that issued assets cannot be escrowed on-chain like XRP, reinforcing the argument that its infrastructure is better suited for controlled distribution. A major point of discussion is the potential for tokenized assets on the XRP Ledger (XRPL). One commenter suggested that the U.S. Treasury could tokenize treasury bonds on XRPL to enable instant cross-border transactions, enhancing liquidity and financial efficiency. Treasury Bills (T-Bills) were among the first assets to be tokenized on the XRPL, and as another commenter pointed out, if the U.S. government controlled the escrow system and mandated the use of XRP in certain transactions, it could drive price appreciation and contribute to national debt reduction. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 ‚Äî TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Bitcoin‚Äôs Fixed Supply and Decentralization Bitcoin‚Äôs proponents argue that its fixed supply of 21 million coins makes it a superior store of value for a national reserve. Unlike XRP‚Äôs escrow model, Bitcoin‚Äôs scarcity is absolute, preventing future supply manipulation. However, concerns exist regarding its regulatory compatibility. A commenter pointed out that government transactions require KYC/AML compliance, meaning any Bitcoin reserve will be managed through regulated platforms, potentially undermining its decentralized nature. Another user challenged the assumption that Bitcoin‚Äôs fixed supply gives it an advantage, arguing that ‚ÄúXRP has a finite limited supply just the same as Bitcoin.‚Äù This highlights a key misconception in the debate, as both assets have predetermined supply limits, though their distribution mechanisms differ. Practical Considerations for U.S. Adoption Usability and control are critical for a government-backed cryptocurrency reserve. Bitcoin‚Äôs lack of a native escrow function and its high transaction costs raise concerns about its efficiency in large-scale financial operations. Meanwhile, XRP‚Äôs speed, low fees, and built-in mechanisms for controlled distribution offer a compelling alternative. One response emphasized that XRP‚Äôs infrastructure is already designed for institutional use, making it a natural fit for central banks and financial entities.

A crypto analyst who previously predicted XRP‚Äòs crash below $2 has provided a more comprehensive outlook, outlining key support and resistance areas that will determine XRP‚Äôs next target. According to TradingView crypto analyst, ‚ÄòMMBTrader,‚Äô the XRP price is set to dump below the $2 threshold. As of writing, CoinMarketCap reports that XRP is trading at $2.2, reflecting a modest 3% increase in value in the last 24 hours. XRP Price Projected To Crash To $1.5 Notably, the cryptocurrency is gradually giving up gains, negatively impacted by the broader market downtrend and lack of bullish drivers. MMBTrader has shared a technical chart supporting his bearish prediction for the XRP price. Related Reading: Pundit Who Correctly Predicted XRP Price Crash To $2.5 Says Demand Zone Will Send It Soaring The TradingView crypto expert has identified a Head and Shoulder pattern on the XRP daily chart, consisting of three peaks: left shoulder, head, and right shoulder. Typically, a classic Head and Shoulder pattern is considered one of the most common indicators of a potential price breakdown, with the price of a cryptocurrency expected to reverse from bullish to bearish. Looking at the price chart, a break below the pattern‚Äôs neckline around the $1.95 price point would confirm XRP‚Äôs bearish position. If the cryptocurrency fails to hold the $1.95 support level, a sharp drop, possibly up to 50%, is expected. This massive crash would effectively place the price around the $1.5 level or even as low as $1.2. While he expects a possible crash to $1.5, MMBTrader also projects an alternative bullish scenario in which the XRP price initiates a strong rebound. The analyst revealed that if the cryptocurrency consolidates near $2 without breaking lower, then a bounce to new highs could follow. Additionally, the TradingView expert believes that the asset could also experience a significant rally toward $5 after its projected 50% price crash. He highlights that if XRP can hold the support level near $1.5, then a strong reversal could occur, potentially triggering a bullish move between $4 and $4.5. Whales Scoop Up $385 Million Amid Market Downtrend While XRP experiences slow momentum due to the market‚Äôs recent decline, whales are seizing the opportunity to buy the dip, accumulating a significant amount of the token. According to crypto analyst Brett, an XRP whale has executed a large-scale transaction, buying over 167 million XRP, valued at $368.4 million, in a single purchase. Related Reading: XRP Price Pump To $3.35 On The Horizon With Bullish Cup And Handle Pattern Formation Brett revealed that this whale purchase was made as the market panicked over increasing volatility and price declines. Over the past few weeks, XRP has struggled to recover from bearish trends, joining the ranks of top cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum, which recorded a major price crash earlier in February. CoinMarketCap‚Äôs data shows that the the altcoin‚Äôs price has fallen by 11.6% in just one week. This decline comes as the broader crypto market faces massive liquidations totaling hundreds of millions of dollars.

Furthermore, Rocket Pool introduces the concept of ‚ÄúrETH‚Äù tokens, which are issued to users who stake ETH in the Rocket Pool network. These rETH tokens represent users‚Äô stake in the pool and can be traded or transferred independently of the underlying ETH, providing liquidity and flexibility to participants. Overall, Rocket Pool aims to democratize Ethereum staking and contribute to the decentralization of the Ethereum network by providing a secure, efficient, and accessible platform for staking participation. As DeFi continues to gain traction, Rocket Pool stands out as a pioneering project at the forefront of innovation in the cryptocurrency ecosystem.

Is the bottom in? Is now a good time to start buying? Or could there still be one more flush-out to come? Bitcoin has been tossed and turned on the waves of economic uncertainty, and buffeted by the winds of an unpredictable geopolitical climate for quite some time now. Will this continue, with Bitcoin going down to the all-important $70,000 level, or is a huge rally about to take place that will take the king of the cryptocurrencies back to the all-time high? Economic headwinds On the economic front, the new U.S. administration has inherited the biggest debt pile the world has ever seen. $8 trillion of which matures in 2025 alone. President Trump‚Äôs tariff wars are causing havoc, both in the United States, and among its major trading partners. Surely, resolutions need to be found in order to get global trade back on its feet again. The U.S. stock market is falling fast. President Trump has always boasted of a strong stock market, so it must be wondered if some kind of strategy is hidden within the application of such heavy tariffs. Russia/Ukraine ceasefire potential at a delicate stage From a geopolitical perspective, things are at an extremely delicate stage. U.S. officials have succeeded in bringing the Ukranians to the peace table in the form of a 30-day ceasefire. It just remains to be seen how the Russians will respond, and Vladimir Putin in particular. Huge Bitcoin tailwind For Bitcoin itself, putting aside the potential economic and geopolitical issues, things have never been better. Legislation is now set to go before Congress and the Senate, which will enshrine every citizen‚Äôs right to hold and transact in Bitcoin. A Strategic Bitcoin Reserve is to be established, and the proposed act will commit the US to buying 1 million BTC over a 5-year period. Short-term: Bitcoin still in the claws of the bears Source: TradingView From a short-term perspective it can be seen that Bitcoin is still firmly in the claws of the bears. The steady roll-over from the $109,000 all-time high is still in force. The $BTC price fell out of a triangle pattern on Sunday, and has been down to test the bottom of the wedge pattern. A rally on Tuesday failed to get back to the breakdown point of the triangle, and it now looks as though the next corrective impulse could be about to begin. Are we approaching the time when the $BTC price finally comes down and tests the major support? If the big rally to the upside is to take place, it would not be a surprise that the $70,000 horizontal support is retested first. Long-term: Major support is close Source: TradingView Zooming out into the weekly time frame, the major support band can be seen with clarity. This stretches from $73,700, down to $68,500. In addition, if one draws the Fibonacci levels from the lowest wick out of the previous bull flag, up to the all-time high, the 0.618 Fibonacci comes within this band at $72,000. Drawing Fibonacci levels for the entire bull market puts the 0.382 Fibonacci precisely on top of the upper support band at $73,700. Coincidence?

If this growth sustains, then it may not be surprising to see the market try to explore new higher price ranges shortly. Listed below are some projects that are worth checking out for those looking to make massive gains as the market recovers from its current price point. Best Crypto to Buy Now for Massive Short-Term Gains BTC Bull ‚Äì (BTCBULL) History has shown that Bitcoin‚Äôs price action dictates market sentiment, and BTC Bull is a meme coin that takes this relationship and turns it into a structured, community-driven investment model. Instead of relying on hype alone, it incorporates strategic airdrops and supply burns that align with Bitcoin‚Äôs price milestones, making it more than just another speculative token. Whale accumulation in Bitcoin is hitting new highs, and tokens that capitalize on this momentum tend to see amplified growth. BTC Bull‚Äôs mechanism ensures that as Bitcoin rises, so do its incentives, rewarding holders at crucial price points while simultaneously reducing supply through programmed burns. This dual approach increases scarcity while strengthening demand, a key reason why BTC Bull‚Äôs presale has already raised over $3.5 million, with early investors anticipating a strong market entry. The project has been dubbed a potential top gainer by top analysts and YouTube channels of popular crypto education companies like 99Bitcoins , among others. Meme coins often rely on the virality element, but BTC Bull merges community-driven engagement with Bitcoin‚Äôs long-term growth potential, offering a way to participate in both the speculative and fundamental aspects of the crypto space. As the bull cycle gains traction, BTC Bull could be positioned to mirror BTC‚Äôs trajectory‚Äîonly with even greater volatility and upside potential. Meme Index ‚Äì (MEMEX) Meme coins are a high-risk, high-reward game‚Äîone breakout project can 10x, while another might fade into irrelevance. Instead of navigating this uncertainty, Meme Index provides an optimized strategy by bundling multiple high-performing meme tokens into one asset, creating a dynamic portfolio that adjusts to market trends. The beauty of Meme Index lies in its adaptive allocation. As certain meme narratives gain traction‚Äîwhether it‚Äôs dog-themed coins, frog coins, or AI-driven meme projects‚Äîthe index rebalances itself, ensuring investors are always positioned within the strongest-performing assets. This removes the need for constant monitoring, allowing for passive exposure to meme-driven volatility without single-token risk. Institutional investors have recognized the growing demand for structured meme investments, helping Meme Index‚Äôs presale raise nearly $4 million despite ongoing market volatility. As retail investors continue to chase the next big meme rally, Meme Index provides a way to stay ahead of trends without the stress of picking individual tokens. With meme coin cycles being unpredictable yet consistently lucrative, Meme Index offers a calculated way to participate in the sector‚Äôs exponential gains without playing the guessing game. Chainlink ‚Äì (LINK) While most cryptocurrencies rely on their blockchains alone, Chainlink‚Äôs impact extends across the entire crypto ecosystem. Acting as the industry‚Äôs leading decentralized oracle network, Chainlink powers real-world data integration for smart contracts, making it an essential infrastructure layer rather than just another token. From DeFi platforms to NFT projects, thousands of blockchain applications depend on Chainlink‚Äôs oracles to fetch accurate price feeds, connect to off-chain data, and ensure trustless execution of automated contracts. This dominance has positioned LINK as a long-term staple within the industry, particularly as blockchain adoption continues to expand into enterprise and institutional use cases. Despite its massive real-world utility, Chainlink‚Äôs price of about $13 has mirrored broader market trends, currently sitting well below its previous all-time highs. However, with whale accumulation picking up and institutional integrations growing, LINK remains a high-conviction play for those looking to invest in infrastructure rather than speculation. In an industry where data accuracy is everything, Chainlink‚Äôs role will only become more critical, making it one of the strongest bets for long-term stability and upside potential. MIND of Pepe ‚Äì (MIND) Most meme tokens live and die by community hype, but MIND of Pepe operates on an entirely different level‚Äîleveraging AI-driven insights and social engagement to stay relevant at all times. Instead of waiting for momentum to build, this token actively participates in shaping market sentiment by analyzing social media trends and engaging with communities in real time. With influencers and retail investors chasing the next viral meme, MIND of Pepe has positioned itself as both a token and an autonomous market presence. This unique approach has drawn attention from analysts, with YouTuber Cilinix Crypto and other experts listing it among the top contenders for significant price action in the near future. Investor interest has already translated into over $7.2 million raised in its presale, an indicator that the market sees potential in a meme coin that doesn‚Äôt just rely on speculation‚Äîbut actively engineers its own relevance. By tracking engagement, adapting to trends, and fueling its own hype cycle, MIND of Pepe could reshape how meme tokens are perceived. As AI continues to integrate into crypto, MIND of Pepe is more than a trend‚Äîit‚Äôs a glimpse into what the future of interactive blockchain projects could look like. Solaxy ‚Äì (SOLX) While many projects struggle to raise capital in uncertain market conditions, Solaxy has defied expectations, securing over $25 million in its presale‚Äîa testament to its strong use case and investor confidence. Unlike traditional Layer 2 solutions that focus exclusively on Ethereum, Solaxy bridges both Ethereum and Solana, offering a faster, cheaper, and more scalable infrastructure for blockchain transactions. What sets Solaxy apart is its focus on efficiency and interoperability. By optimizing throughput across two of the largest blockchain ecosystems, it eliminates congestion issues while enhancing liquidity access. This makes it an ideal environment for DeFi applications, NFT marketplaces, and high-frequency trading protocols, all of which require seamless cross-chain functionality. With Ethereum and Solana both maintaining strong developer ecosystems, a solution that enhances their synergy rather than competing with them is an obvious necessity. The success of its presale confirms that institutional and retail investors recognize Solaxy as more than just another Layer 2‚Äîit‚Äôs a much-needed enhancement to existing blockchain infrastructure. Given the growing demand for scalable blockchain solutions, Solaxy‚Äôs ability to bridge two powerhouse networks while maintaining low fees and high security makes it a compelling choice for those seeking long-term upside. Catslap ‚Äì (SLAP) Meme coins need more than just a catchy name to succeed‚Äîthey need constant social momentum, an engaged community, and a concept that sticks. Catslap has all three, leveraging one of the internet‚Äôs most viral cat GIFs into a fully-fledged, community-driven token with gamified elements on the horizon. What makes Catslap different from hundreds of meme projects is its ability to remain consistently relevant across social media platforms. Its branding taps into a universally recognized internet moment, making it instantly familiar to meme traders and casual crypto enthusiasts alike. The project‚Äôs early funding success and steady community growth suggest that investors see long-term potential in a token designed for both humor and sustained engagement. Beyond the meme itself, the Catslap roadmap includes interactive elements that could turn it into a more immersive experience rather than just another speculative asset. While many meme tokens rely solely on their early hype cycle, Catslap‚Äôs developers are focused on ensuring longevity through continuous engagement strategies. As meme coins continue to dominate trader speculation, Catslap‚Äôs strong community backing and plans for interactive utilities position it as a high-potential player in this ever-evolving space. $SLAP is a vibe! ‚Äî Crypto Admiral (@Crypto_admiral1) February 21, 2025 As meme coins continue to dominate trader speculation, Catslap‚Äôs strong community backing and plans for interactive utilities position it as a high-potential player in this ever-evolving space. Best Wallet Token ‚Äì (BEST) Crypto investors don‚Äôt just need a place to store their assets‚Äîthey need a fully integrated ecosystem where they can trade, stake, and manage their portfolios without switching between multiple platforms. Best Wallet is designed to be that solution, and its BEST token presale success‚Äîraising nearly $11 million so far‚Äîproves that investors are eager for a next-generation wallet with built-in trading and DeFi functionalities. At its core, Best Wallet aims to streamline crypto asset management, offering support for over 60 blockchains, a decentralized exchange facility, and high-yield staking opportunities. Instead of being just another storage solution, it acts as a command center for all things crypto, making it particularly attractive to active traders. The BEST token plays a crucial role in this ecosystem, providing holders with reduced trading fees, governance voting rights, and staking rewards. Investors who buy in early can benefit from utility-driven demand, as the platform‚Äôs adoption is expected to increase usage of the token over time. With security and accessibility being major concerns in the industry, Best Wallet isn‚Äôt just trying to compete with existing wallets‚Äîit‚Äôs aiming to redefine how traders interact with their assets, making it an exciting project to watch as it nears launch. Conclusion Big gains don‚Äôt come without risk, and that‚Äôs the reality of the market. Every project listed here‚Äîwhether it‚Äôs a meme coin with an ironclad community or a blockchain utility token reshaping infrastructure‚Äîcomes with serious potential, but also the volatility that defines this space. For those who worry about every dollar in their portfolio, these tokens may not be the safest bet. But for investors who understand the game, who aren‚Äôt afraid of short-term swings, and who recognize that the biggest plays come from catching opportunities early, this list offers something far more valuable than just another generic recommendation. Whale accumulation data is pointing to a potential market-wide breakout, and history has shown that those who act before the surge‚Äînot during‚Äîare the ones who see life-changing returns. If losing sleep over market dips isn‚Äôt an issue, and the idea of entering before the masses sounds like the right move, then these projects might just be the best opportunities available right now.

This heightened interest is evident through their substantial accumulation of ADA tokens and their strategic move to file for a spot Cardano Exchange-Traded Fund (ETF) with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). This filing aims to list the Cardano ETF on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE), providing investors with regulated exposure to ADA without the need to directly hold the cryptocurrency.

It would provide institutional and retail investors with a regulated avenue to gain exposure to ADA, potentially attracting substantial capital inflows into the Cardano ecosystem. Such a development could enhance ADA‚Äôs liquidity, increase its adoption, and contribute to the overall maturation of the cryptocurrency market. Grayscale‚Äôs proactive accumulation of ADA and its pursuit of a Cardano ETF signify a growing institutional interest in Cardano. The increased probability of the ETF‚Äôs approval, coupled with positive market reactions, suggests that an ADA ETF may be closer to realization than previously anticipated. As the SEC‚Äôs review process unfolds, the cryptocurrency community remains attentive to further developments that could shape the future landscape of Cardano and the broader digital asset market.

Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick told CBS News in an interview emphasizing proposals such as removing taxes on tips, overtime, and Social Security contributions, describing them as transformative ideas for America. Lutnick‚Äôs comments on tip taxes and social security echo Trump‚Äôs promises to eliminate tip taxes while also pushing for sweeping tax cuts for individuals and corporations. Lutnick reaffirmed his commitment to working toward Trump‚Äôs vision of a tax-free system for those below the income threshold. A screenshot of Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick attending a CBS Interview on Trump‚Äôs tariffs moves | Source: CBS Evening News via YouTube Lutnick‚Äôs remarks spark social media debate on Trump‚Äôs tax plan Lutnick‚Äôs comments are being celebrated on social media by prominent Republican supporters like Benny Johnson, who posted the clip on X (formerly known as Twitter) to responses that praised Donald Trump and called it a ‚Äúgreat move‚Äù and ‚Äúamazing‚Äù. One user said this will likely be one of the most popular pieces of legislation ever passed in American history. Another called it ‚Äúthe largest tax cuts for the middle class in U.S. history. Letting Americans keep what they have earned is a great start to making America prosperous.‚Äù Another user noted that no income taxes for those making under $150k would be a great move as it will help so many people, and that policy could also stimulate the economy. Still, not everyone welcomed the news with open arms. There were questions about the legality and constitutionality of a move like that. Critics asked whether exempting certain income groups from federal tax would violate the Equal Protection Clause, which requires that laws enacted at the federal level be fair. Others gawked at the income threshold, asking why the bottom for the ‚Äúvery rich‚Äù was set at $150,000 instead of $250,000. Trump pushes for tariffs over taxes to boost U.S. wealth Donald Trump has previously said he would like to remove taxes on citizens and replace them with tariffs on other countries. He has repeatedly voiced support for the move‚Äîeven during his campaign to become President last year. Speaking at the 2025 Republican Issues Conference at the Trump National Doral, Miami, on January 27, he advocated doing away with income tax for Americans, saying that it is ‚Äútime for the US to return to a system that made us richer and powerful‚Äù. He added that the US should be enriching itself by ‚Äútariffing and taxing foreign nationals‚Äù. ‚ÄúAmerica‚Äôs gonna be very rich again, and it‚Äôs gonna happen very quickly. It‚Äôs time for the United States to return to the system that made us richer and more powerful than ever before,‚Äù Trump said. Trump recalled his speech from last week, in which he said that instead of taxing American citizens to enrich foreign nations, they should tariff and tax foreign nations to enrich U.S. citizens. After Donald Trump took over in January, America slapped tariffs on trading partners and allies, including Canada. The EU, Canada, and China have vowed or enforced retaliatory measures.

Millions of people hold crypto in different wallet types, yet few can use these assets at local stores. Merchants hesitate to accept crypto due to price volatility, technical barriers, and high integration costs. As SpacePay approaches $1 million in presale funding with tokens at $0.003126, its focus on solving this practical gap stands out. The Missing Connection in Crypto Commerce A major disconnect exists between crypto ownership and actual spending options. While people hold billions in digital assets across hundreds of wallet types, few merchants accept these currencies for everyday purchases. This gap prevents crypto from fulfilling its original purpose as a payment system for regular transactions. Merchants hesitate for several practical reasons. Traditional crypto payments expose businesses to price volatility ‚Äì a $100 sale might be worth $90 by settlement time. Most systems require special equipment or software that costs thousands to implement. The technical complexity often confuses both staff and customers, creating checkout delays and errors. Previous crypto payment solutions typically charge 1-2% fees plus network costs, making them more expensive than traditional card processing for many transactions. Settlement times of hours or even days create cash flow problems for businesses that need immediate access to their earnings. These barriers create a market opportunity that SpacePay addresses by connecting existing payment terminals directly to crypto wallets. 325+ Wallets, One Simple Payment System SpacePay solves wallet fragmentation through a universal QR code system. Instead of requiring merchants to support hundreds of different crypto payment methods, the platform generates a single QR code that works with any of the 325+ supported wallets. This universal approach means stores don‚Äôt need to choose which cryptocurrencies to accept or which wallet systems to support. The technical process stays invisible to both merchants and customers. When a store enters a payment amount on their terminal, SpacePay‚Äôs system creates a QR code containing all necessary transaction details. This code works as a universal translator between different wallet protocols, handling the complex mapping of payment information across various crypto standards. Behind the scenes, the system verifies payments through smart contracts that check wallet balances and transaction validity. This verification happens within seconds, confirming the payment to the merchant‚Äôs terminal just as quickly as a card transaction. By eliminating the need for special equipment, SpacePay removes a major adoption barrier. Stores use their existing Android-based payment terminals through a simple software update, requiring zero new hardware purchases. Merchant Benefits Beyond Lower Fees While the 0.5% fee creates obvious savings compared to 3% card rates, merchants gain several advantages beyond cost reduction. Instant access to funds changes how businesses operate daily. A store making morning sales can use that money immediately for afternoon inventory purchases. This quick access helps businesses respond to opportunities faster ‚Äì from supplier discounts to unexpected stock needs. Price protection removes the volatility risk that previously kept merchants from accepting crypto. When a store sells an item for $100, they receive exactly $100 in their local currency regardless of crypto market movements. This guarantee lets businesses set consistent prices without worrying about exchange rate changes affecting their income. Accepting crypto payments opens stores to new customer segments. Crypto holders often seek businesses where they can spend their digital assets, creating new sales opportunities. For international businesses, the system allows tourists and cross-border shoppers to pay without currency conversion fees or foreign transaction charges. The multi-wallet compatibility means merchants don‚Äôt need to choose which cryptocurrencies to support. By accepting payments from 325+ different wallets , stores accommodate the widest possible range of crypto users. From Concept to $1M Presale Success SpacePay built its presale success on completed achievements rather than just future plans. The platform secured $750,000 in private investment, which funded development of the core payment system. This early backing from professional investors provided the foundation for building working technology before seeking wider market support. Key milestones show actual progress beyond concepts. Smart Contract Audits verify that the payment system processes transactions securely while protecting user funds. The ‚ÄúNew Payment Platform of the Year‚Äù award at the CorporateLiveWire Global Awards 2022/23 provides external validation from industry experts. These concrete achievements help explain why presale funding approaches $1 million with tokens at $0.003126. The expansion strategy focuses on creating adoption clusters in business districts. When several stores in a shopping area use SpacePay, they create natural awareness among both customers and neighboring businesses. This organic growth happens through visible results rather than marketing efforts. New supporters can join the presale at the current token price using USDT, AVAX, BASE, MATIC, ETH, BNB, or bank cards. The platform accepts various payment methods through a clear process on the official website. Community channels on Telegram and X share regular updates about development progress.

41583438,https://crypto.news/?p=14345047,1741858824,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/73/41583438.jpeg,"PI up 13% ahead of Pi Day, can the rally hold?",https://crypto.news/pi-up-13-ahead-of-pi-day-can-the-rally-hold/,"Pi Network‚Äôs native token PI continued to rally for the second consecutive day amid community hype ahead of Pi Day. According to data from crypto.news, Pi Network ( PI ) rose to an intraday high of $1.79 on March 13, nearly 42% above its lowest point this week. Its market cap was seated at a little over $12.2 billion, while its daily trading volume doubled over the previous day, hovering over $930 million at the time of writing. Although the crypto is still down over 42.5% from its all-time high of $2.99 in February, PI has recently made a huge leap in rankings. Just a week ago, it was ranked below 3,000 on CoinMarketCap, but now it has skyrocketed to 11th place, surpassing major cryptos like Chainlink (LINK), Hedera (HBAR), and Stellar (XLM). Its circulating supply currently stands at over 7.13 billion tokens. Today‚Äôs gains come just a day before Pi Day on March 14, a big event for the PI ecosystem. Specifically, users need to complete their KYC verification and migrate their tokens mined on the testnet to the mainnet by 8:00 AM UTC tomorrow. If they don‚Äôt, they risk losing the mined tokens. However, many users are still struggling with KYC verification due to technical issues, making it difficult to migrate their PI coins to the mainnet. Meanwhile, the date also marks Pi Network‚Äôs sixth anniversary since its launch on March 14, 2019, along with its mobile app and whitepaper. You might also like: Welcome to Pi Coin‚Äôs chaos ‚Äî A $12b crypto, a Binance listing rumor, a frustrated community, and a CEO calling it a Ponzi One of the biggest events in Pi Network‚Äôs history was its massive airdrop on Feb. 20, 2025, alongside the launch of its Open Mainnet. After the launch, Pi Coin saw major price swings‚Äîspiking to $1.97, dropping to $0.737 the next day, and then bouncing back to $1.29. At its peak, the total value of Pi tokens distributed reached $13.8 billion. So far, 7.13 billion tokens have been distributed, and another 188 million PI tokens are set to be unlocked this March, available to over 1 million users. Despite the large supply entering circulation, the price is unlikely to be affected since 63% of Pi tokens are locked for three years, and another 14% are locked for one year. This means most unlocked tokens won‚Äôt hit the market immediately, helping to keep prices stable. One of the key catalysts for the current rally to extend is speculation around a potential Binance listing . In a February vote, over 87% of participants supported adding PI to Binance‚Äôs spot market, but Binance has yet to respond, leaving its listing uncertain. Meanwhile, PI is currently available on major centralized exchanges like OKX, MEXC, Gate.io, and Bitget, among others. PI price analysis Technical indicators are in favor of a potential continuation of PI‚Äôs uptrend. On the 4-hour USDT price chart, PI has been trading near the upper Bollinger Band, which indicates strong buying pressure fueling the bullish trend. PI price, Bollinger Bands and Aroon chart ‚Äî March 13 | Source: crypto.news With the Aroon Up at 78.57% and the Aroon Down at 0%. A high Aroon Up value suggests frequent new highs, while the absence of Aroon Down signals a lack of bearish influence. With the Relative Strength Index at 60, PI still has room for further gains before it hits overbought levels. However, once it approaches this threshold, it may experience a slight pullback before potentially continuing its uptrend. Hence, PI is most likely to continue its rally toward the psychological resistance level at $2, which previously acted as resistance on March 5. A break above this level could propel the token higher, potentially retesting its all-time high. Market commentators have also made long-term bullish predictions for PI, expecting it to reach $4 and beyond in the coming weeks. Others have speculated on even more ambitious targets, with one community member arguing that strong community backing could push the price to $10.

Bitcoin liquidity clusters at $84K-$85K After Bitcoin's ( BTC ) price tumbled on March 9, it rebounded to test the overhead resistance zone between $84,000 and $85,000 three times, spurring traders to aggressively build short positions in this range. The liquidation heatmap data suggested that more than $300 million in short positions were piled in this price region, which would be liquidated if the price moved above the $85,000 resistance.

Moreover, triggering liquidations above $85,000 could fuel further bullish momentum, allowing Bitcoin to form a higher high and turn this level into new support. A CME Bitcoin futures gap from the previous weekend also remained unfilled between $85,000 and $86,000. With a 100% record of six gaps filled in the past four months, this setup further increased the chances of flipping the overhead resistance into support at $85,000. Bitcoin 4-hour chart. Source: Cointelegraph/TradingView If this happens, the next major resistance lies at $90,000, which could liquidate over $1.6 billion in short positions for a retest of the $95,000 resistance level above, i.e., a 12% jump from the current price. Related: Bitcoin must secure weekly close above $89K to confirm bottom has passed Bitcoin analyst Mark Cullen underlined a similar outlook for Bitcoin but warn ed that the price continues to move ‚Äúcorrectively,‚Äù implying further sideways movement before a short squeeze. On the contrary, Valeria, a crypto analyst and funded trader, said that BTC was showing signs of distribution near the $85,000 range, which is short-term bearish. The trader highlighted that the BTC price might thread lower below $80,000 before a bullish breakout occurs. Coinbase, Binance diverge on orderbook trends Spot traders on Binance have been aggressively selling over the past few days, according to data from Aggr.trade, with selling pressure peaking during the local lows at $76,650. Conversely, Coinbase spot buyers placed bids here, leading to BTC‚Äôs rebound above $80,000. Binance, Coinbase orderbooks. Source: Aggr.trade On March 12, a similar discrepancy was observed, with Binance spot traders selling near the $85,000 resistance, as Coinbase traders defended the price at $81,000 during the early US trading session, avoiding further downside. Related: Crypto trading volume slumps, signaling market exhaustion: Analysis While Coinbase has led BTC‚Äôs rally in the past, an opposing stance between the two leading exchanges might slow BTC‚Äôs momentum to move swiftly through the resistance levels. Thus, for Bitcoin to reclaim higher highs at $85,000, $90,000 and $95,000 over the next couple of weeks, spot trading activity between the two major exchanges may need more collective direction.

41583965,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=692077,1741859326,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/41583965.jpeg,China‚Äôs economy still dealing with crippling deflation amid rumors of a trade deal with Trump,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/china-still-dealing-with-crippling-deflation/,"China is stuck in its longest deflation crisis in decades, and the numbers keep getting worse. Prices across the country have been falling for two straight years, and analysts say 2025 could be the third. If that happens, it‚Äôll be the longest deflationary streak since the 1960s. The latest inflation data shows consumer prices dropped into negative territory in January and February for the first time since 2021. Core inflation, which excludes food and energy, fell by 0.1% in February, something that has only happened twice in the past 15 years. Policymakers in Beijing are desperately trying to stop the bleeding, promising more economic support. But their efforts are being overshadowed by an aggressive wave of US tariffs. Donald Trump, just months into his second term as president, slapped a vindictive 20% tariff on all Chinese imports, which has slowed China‚Äôs export growth and hurt businesses that were already struggling. Beijing responded with its own counter-tariffs on US products, deepening tensions between the world‚Äôs two largest economies. There‚Äôs uncertainty over whether Trump will follow through on his campaign pledge to raise tariffs to 60%, but if he does, that would cripple China‚Äôs exports even more and way faster. While there are rumors that Trump may be open to a trade deal in the near future, nothing has been confirmed by the president himself yet. Veteran diplomat Kishore Mahbubani says that Trump, while tough on China publicly, may want a trade deal‚Äîsomething that was less likely under Joe Biden‚Äôs administration. Mahbubani says Trump could reach an agreement if China makes key concessions. ‚ÄúIf Trump can get China to open its markets, accept more American exports, and even invest in the US, a win-win trade deal is possible,‚Äù he said . Former US ambassador to Singapore David Adelman also pointed out that China has a strong economic interest in America‚Äôs success. The US is still China‚Äôs largest trading partner, and while demand for Chinese goods has fallen, American consumers remain crucial to China‚Äôs economy. On the other hand, China‚Äôs rising middle class is creating new opportunities for US businesses‚Äîbut only if trade tensions cool down. Consumers hold back spending as prices keep dropping Deflation is hitting Chinese businesses hard because people aren‚Äôt spending. When prices fall, consumers wait for even lower prices, making them hesitant to buy cars, appliances, and other big-ticket items. It‚Äôs a brutal cycle. The weaker demand means businesses have to cut prices further, which shrinks profits, reduces hiring, and leads to layoffs. A real estate collapse has made things worse. China‚Äôs property market has been in free fall, and with it, consumer confidence. Home values have dropped too, and that‚Äôs pushing people to cut back on spending. Tech and finance workers are also feeling the pressure, as some of the country‚Äôs highest-paying jobs are seeing salary cuts and mass layoffs. Meanwhile, Beijing‚Äôs push to expand manufacturing has only led to overproduction, flooding the market with goods that people aren‚Äôt buying. The deflation crisis is also making debt more expensive because, in a deflationary environment, the real cost of borrowing rises. That makes it harder for companies to take out loans, expand, or invest, which could lead to a ton of corporate defaults, putting China‚Äôs entire financial system at risk. In past financial crises, China‚Äôs leaders responded with aggressive stimulus measures, injecting cash into the economy, but this time, Beijing is holding back. President Xi Jinping has said that he doesn‚Äôt want to rely on debt-driven growth and is instead pushing for economic restructuring. Infrastructure spending and real estate development, which used to be the go-to strategies, are no longer priorities. Instead, China is betting on advanced technologies and manufacturing‚Äîbut that strategy isn‚Äôt paying off fast enough. China‚Äôs 10-year government bond yield hit an all-time low earlier this year, a sign that market confidence is crumbling. Foreign investors are pulling out because they‚Äôre not sure if Beijing will step in to stabilize the economy. While the US and China fight over trade, other Asian economies are feeling the pressure. On Monday, Singapore‚Äôs Deputy Prime Minister Gan Kim Yong pointed out that there‚Äôs a ‚Äúpower shift to Asia‚Äù, saying that the region‚Äôs share of global GDP will rise from 50% today to 60% by 2030. Adelman described Southeast Asia as a collection of neutral players who have long benefited from US military protection while maintaining strong economic ties with China, which is getting harder as both Trump and Xi demand stronger allegiances. Some countries are already choosing sides, like South Korea and Vietnam, who both announced 10% tariffs on Chinese steel in February. If more Asian countries follow the US in restricting Chinese imports, China‚Äôs export-driven economy will suffer even more, adding to deflationary pressures. However, over time, ‚Äúthe U.S. and China will realize that it is in their interest to try and work with regions like Southeast Asia,‚Äù rather than forcing them to pick a side, Mahbubani said.

This makes Ripple the first blockchain payments provider licensed in the Dubai International Finance Centre (DIFC), unlocking fully regulated cross-border cryptocurrency transactions in the United Arab Emirates (UAE) positioning Ripple to capitalize on a $40 billion cross-border payments market in the UAE, according to World Bank data. Huge news üî• @Ripple is now DFSA licensed to offer regulated crypto payments in the @DIFC bringing the speed and efficiencies of blockchain to one of the world‚Äôs biggest trade and cross-border payments hubs. A big thank you to our partners at @DIFC and the DFSA for their early‚Ä¶ ‚Äî Reece Merrick (@reece_merrick) March 13, 2025 Founded in 2012, Ripple specializes in providing enterprise-grade payment solutions, enabling financial institutions and businesses to process faster, cheaper, and more transparent transactions using blockchain technology. This DFSA approval is Ripple‚Äôs first license in the Middle East, reinforcing its global commitment to regulatory compliance and its strategic focus on expanding in high-growth regions. Businesses in the UAE can now access Ripple‚Äôs flagship payments product, which prioritizes seamless compliance while leveraging digital assets for real-world utility. Ripple‚Äôs CEO weighs in on approval in UAE Brad Garlinghouse, Ripple‚Äôs CEO, hailed the development as a turning point: ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre witnessing unprecedented growth in the crypto industry, fueled by clearer regulations and rising institutional adoption. The UAE‚Äôs proactive approach to fostering tech and crypto innovation positions it to reap significant benefits.‚Äù The approval also underscores Ripple‚Äôs broader mission to bridge traditional finance and blockchain. The company‚Äôs technology powers instant cross-border settlements, a stark improvement over traditional banking systems that often take days to clear. This utility is expected to accelerate stablecoin adoption in the UAE, with Ripple‚Äôs recently launched RLUSD stablecoin already surpassing a $100 million market cap since its debut on global exchanges in late December 2024. Impact on XRP‚Äôs price Central to Ripple‚Äôs ecosystem is XRP , a cryptocurrency designed to facilitate rapid and cost-effective international transfers. Unlike common misconceptions, Ripple does not own or control XRP. Instead, XRP was created by Ripple‚Äôs founders, Chris Larsen, Jed McCaleb, and others, before the company‚Äôs inception, with a fixed supply of 100 billion tokens. Ripple holds a significant portion of XRP in escrow to support its payment solutions, releasing it periodically to enhance liquidity and adoption. The XRP Ledger, an open-source, decentralized blockchain, operates independently of Ripple, allowing anyone to use it for transactions. Despite Ripple‚Äôs regulatory win, XRP‚Äôs price reaction has been subdued. As of March 13, the token trades at $2.25, up 2.34% in the past 24 hours. However, it‚Äôs down 12.56% over the last seven days, pulling back from a weekly high of $2.61. Analysts suggest that while Ripple‚Äôs expansion boosts XRP‚Äôs utility case, broader market dynamics continue to dictate its short-term performance.

Cryptocurrency analyst Matthew Hyland said it is too early to say that Bitcoin's deep downtrend is over. The analyst said that Bitcoin needs to close the week above $89,000 to say that the downtrend is over and the uptrend has begun. Hyland warned that a weekly close above $89,000 would confirm that Bitcoin has bottomed, and that if BTC fails to close above that level, the price could drop to between $74,000 and $69,000. ‚ÄúIf Bitcoin makes a weekly close above 89,000, the uptrend will strengthen. However, if it cannot break this resistance level, there may be a further decline. Breaking through resistance usually leads to further upside. ‚ÄúIf we get a weekly close above $89,000, I think the bottom has come for Bitcoin.

Investors are now hopeful that the Fed will adopt a dovish monetary policy, which could drive demand for risk assets. With inflation cooling, how will it affect the price of top crypto coins like Ethereum, XRP, and Dogecoin perform? Crypto Price Up Today As US Inflation Data Cools Bitcoin price has rebounded above $83,000 today, pushing crypto coins up after US CPI cooled to 2.8% in February. The core CPI, which excludes food and energy costs dropped to 3.1%, while the annual inflation eased to 2.8%, outperforming the expected 2.9%. Despite this drop, inflation remains above the Fed‚Äôs target rate of 2%. Moreover, President Trump‚Äôs tariff hikes and fears of a US recession happening this year have not done much to raise investor confidence. Economists told Reuters that despite the cooling inflation, the Fed had the uphill task of balancing this data with the risks from tariffs. Data from the CME FedWatch Tool also shows that 97% of investors anticipate that the Fed will leave rates unchanged at between 4.25% and 4.5% at next week‚Äôs FOMC meeting. CME FedWatch Tool Nevertheless, other analysts remain hopeful that the Fed should trim rates. According to Anthony Pompliano, the real inflation rate is lower than 2.8% and the Fed should ease the monetary policy to stimulate spending. As the fears of inflation ease, how will it affect the price of crypto coins? Let‚Äôs explore. Ethereum Price Analysis Ethereum price today remains bearish despite Bitcoin‚Äôs gains. At press time, ETH trades at $1,873 with a 1.8% drop in 24 hours. CryptoQuant CEO Ki Young Ju has noted that the price of ETH has plunged on active selling over the past 3 months, with the NetTakerVolume Chart showing massive outflows. ETH NetTakerVolume Such intense selling leads to seller exhaustion, which may precede a major ETH price rebound . The RSI on the Ethereum daily price chart stands at 31, indicating that the crypto coin is currently oversold. If this marked a local bottom for ETH, the price first needs to retake the $2,000 psychological level, with the next resistance zones lying at $2,150 and $2,400. ETH/USDT: 1-day Chart Dogecoin Price Eyes Recovery as Active Addresses Jump Dogecoin is also showing signs of a recovery as crypto prices move up today. The largest meme coin could be on the verge of an upswing after a surge in the number of active addresses. Popular analyst Ali Charts noted that the active address count on the Dogecoin network had increased by 47% over the past month from 110,000 to 163,000. Dogecoin Active Addresses This increase is bullish for Dogecoin price today after DOGE bounced from support . It suggests that there is increased participation from traders, which may help drive an upward price trend as crypto coins rebound. XRP Price Eyes Rally as Bullish Signals Align XRP price today has made a rebound and could also be on the verge of a major price rally due to several bullish catalysts. As Coingape reported, Ripple obtained a DFSA license to operate in Dubai. Dubai is one of the biggest crypto hubs and Ripple‚Äôs entry will help boost adoption and possibly drive an XRP price rally. At the same time, the SEC vs. Ripple lawsuit is on the verge of a settlement, which is also good for Ripple price. As crypto prices show signs of a rebound today, XRP is well-positioned for an uptrend. Final Thoughts on Crypto Price Today Crypto prices posted slight gains today as cooling inflation fuelled optimism about a Federal Reserve rate cut. Risk assets like Dogecoin, Ethereum, and XRP could see renewed bullish momentum that may catalyze a sustained price rally.

However, the attention escalated with the launch, as investors and traders eyed it as the potential coin due to its hype, major exchange listing, and deflationary activities. With the conjunction of hype and bullish factors, investors anticipate Pi Coin price hitting $10, especially as the Elon Musk parody account promotes the token with a significant giveaway. Is a $10 target possible? Let‚Äôs discuss this. Pi Network Price Surge 15% With Building Bullish Momentum Pi Coin is among the most bullish tokens due to the broader crypto market recovery past the US CPI data release . The Pi Network price has surged to a many days‚Äô high of $1.78 earlier in the day, booming more than 15%. As it currently stands at $1.70, following an uptrend, the target of $2.98 (ATH) seems achievable, especially with the rising trading volume and open interest data. According to CoinmarketCap , the 24-hour trading volume has surged 131.39% to $961M, showing building investor confidence amidst the Pi Day uptrend. Why is the Pi Network Price Surging Today? The Pi Day or the KYC deadline and Mainnet Migration is set for March 14, 2025, which has created a sense of urgency among investors, resulting in high network activity. This is because investors with unverified KYC would lose all their holdings. In addition, there is intense speculation that the popular cryptocurrency exchange, Binance, will list the Pi Network coin, fueling its price. Last but not least, there is strong market participation due to its performance and growing utility. It has an active user base of 65M and over 100 decentralized apps, breaking key resistance levels. With that, analysts predict potential rallies to $5 and $10 higher in the coming weeks. Interestingly, the crypto influencer promotions and support are also fueling this rally. Can Pi Coin Price Reach $10 Amid Parody Elon Musk Account‚Äôs Giveaway? The famous parody Elon Musk account also supports the Pi Coin and did not step back from benefitting from this token‚Äôs hype. In the recent X post, the account holder has announced to send $500 in PI to 20 people who will like the post and follow the account, building engagement among the community. A screenshot of the portfolio shows that the person holds 2134877 PI, equivalent to $3.6M. More importantly, it displayed that the person has nearly 100% returns on the Pi Coin token, boosting investor confidence higher. However, as the token has not had a rally close to $10, various bullish factors must be supported for this to happen. If Pi Network price continues to break resistance and maintain a high trading volume, it can get to new highs. In addition, the exchange listing and increased adoption could introduce additional bullishness. However, the token unlocks and allegations of scams could introduce selling pressure. Technical Analysis: Is a $10 Rally Really Possible? Various crypto analysts have presented Pi Network price predictions and strong trust in the token for a bullish uptrend. One with the Twitter handle Crypto King claims that the Pi Coin could break its ATHs if it follows a certain price structure. On a long-term goal, the individual claims the token can achieve $10. However, the team must have actual utility as, without that, it could fall to a low of $1. I can be wrong, and I don‚Äôt own any $PI, but looking at the price movements, if $PI pulls this chart, it‚Äôs breaking ATH. Honestly, it would takes years to do that only if Pi Core Team is legit adding some utility. If not, $PI will head straight to sub 1$. Another analyst, Coinvo, has a similar take based on the Fibonacci retracement zone. According to him, PI is at the key zone, which often signals a strong bounce. With that, he predicted a parabolic move upward, but this target is also for the long term and fueled by the exchange listings, utility, and other bullish factors. It looks like $PI is ready to go parabolic from this Fibonacci zone! As a result, the Pi Network price rising to $10 in the short term is highly unlikely, even with a parody Elon Musk endorsement. However, a catalyst like a Crypto Reserve formation or bull rally can make this happen in the most optimistic scenario.

The large-cap altcoin, with a fully diluted valuation of about $224 billion and a 24-hour average trading volume of around $4.7 billion, has rebounded over 10 percent in the past two days from a crucial support level. After being trapped in a falling trend since the second inauguration of U.S. President Donald Trump Donald Trump Donald Trump is an American former president politician, businessman, and media personality, who served as the 45th president of the U.S. between 2017 to 2021. Trump earned a Bachelor of science in economics from the University of Pennsylvania in 1968. Trump won the 2016 presidential election as the Republican Party nominee against Democratic Party nominee Hillary Clinton while losing the popular vote. As president, Trump ordered a travel ban on citizens from several Muslim-majority countries, diverted military funding toward building a wall on the U.S.‚ÄìMexico border, and implemented a family separation policy. Trump has remained a prominent figure in the Republican Party and is considered a likely candidate for the 2024 presidential election President XRP price retested and rebounded from a crucial support level of around $1.9 in the past few days. XRP Price Chart Insights and Prediction By now, it is safe to say that XRP price has already finalized the first rally of the 2024/2025 crypto bull rally and is in the process of kickstarting the next leg. From an Elliott wave principle, the XRP price has completed the first wave and is now on the edge of winding up the second wave, characterized by ABC correction. From a technical analysis standpoint, XRP price, in the daily time frame, has been forming a mega-phone structure in the past few weeks. In the past few days, XRP price has successfully rebounded from the lower border of the mega-phone structure. With the daily Relative Strength Index (RSI) forming a bullish divergence, XRP price is well positioned to rally towards $3 in the near future. However, a consistent close below the established support level of around $1.9 will trigger a further selloff in the subsequent weeks. Factors Fueling Bullish Outlook As Coinpedia has explained in the past, Ripple Labs has made deliberate efforts to build the XRPL network and enhance the mainstream adoption of XRP via the web3 ecosystem. Already, Ripple Labs has launched a fiat-backed Stablecoin on the XRPL dubbed RLUSD to enhance liquidity for XRP-based DeFi protocols. In a bid to ensure sustainable future growth, Ripple Labs has focused on working together with regulators around the world. As the SEC vs Ripple case approaches the end under the Trump administration, the payment blockchain announced that it has secured regulatory approval from the Dubai Financial Services Authority (DFSA).",Price Analysis|Ripple (XRP),EN,0,0,TRADING|XRP|REGULATION|BTC|MARKET,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-03-13 10:11:46

On Monday, Sun pointed out the network‚Äôs high-leverage trading issues, which he deemed would cause losses to decentralized finance protocols using the blockchain. As of Thursday‚Äôs early Asian trading session, ETH was valued at $1,880, a 51.63% decline over the past three months, when it clocked $3,888 during the December bull run. Bears have driven the crypto down 30.6% in the last 30 days and nearly 18% in the past week, per Coingecko. Market watchers weigh in on Ethereum‚Äôs struggles Sun‚Äôs question had a fair few responses from the crypto community, including a controversial one from artificial intelligence crypto finance system PostFiat founder Alexander, who pointed to Ethereum‚Äôs inability to sustain meaningful transaction growth since its 2017 peak. Alexander bashed the network for failing to become deflationary when it moved from a proof-of-work (PoW) to a proof-of-stake (PoS) model, noting that the most actively used parts of the blockchain, such as Arbitrum (ARB) and Base, are either highly inflationary or centralized. ‚ÄúSo begs the question‚Ä¶. What is the point of the chain to which the answer is: the same thing as every other blockchain. To move tether about and to ‚Äòstore value‚Äô Pretty depressing tbh.‚Äù he remarked. In a March 13 X post, CryptoQuant CEO Ki Young Ju shared a chart that showed the record selling pressure on Ethereum over the past three months. On-chain data revealed that $1.8 billion worth of ETH exited exchanges last week, the largest outflows since December 2022. Ethereum price 30-day moving average. Source: CryptoQuant According to the chart, the last time ETH had a 30-day positive moving average was on February 26, when Bitcoin‚Äôs price was stumbling towards $82,000. The coin‚Äôs 24-hour Coinbase premium index has also been trending in the red for the past seven days, spelling weakening buying pressures from US traders. Ethereum‚Äôs trading volume has plummeted by 38.17% to $36.82 billion, and open interest (OI) in futures has also dropped by 2.61% to $18.05 billion, suggesting there are more traders exiting positions than opening new ones. CryptoQuant data also shows that options volume has declined by 7.43% to $663.71 million, but options open interest has increased by 2.17% to $5.77 billion, showing there is a rising demand for longer-term derivatives positions as traders wait to see where ETH‚Äôs price will go. Will Ethereum recover? Ethereum‚Äôs price action as of now looks largely bearish; bulls are slowly ceding control to market bears, dragging the crypto‚Äôs price down further. In the past 24 hours, ETH futures liquidations reached $43.12 million, according to Coinglass. Of this total, $26.94 million were long liquidations, while $16.18 million came from shorts, indicating a market lacking clear direction. Analysts have outlined two possible scenarios for Ethereum‚Äôs next move. A bearish breakdown could see ETH fall below the $1,440 threshold, potentially triggering further declines toward the $1,000 mark. On the other hand, a recovery above resistance levels near $1,960 could help the coin garner some positive momentum, with a possible push toward $2,200. Technical indicators like the Relative Strength Index (RSI) at 32.1 and Stochastic Oscillator (Stoch) at 25.1 are nearing oversold territory, adding to the bearish momentum. A failure to hold above the $1,750 psychological support zone may increase selling pressure, while a daily close below $1,700 could invalidate any consolidation attempts, accelerating the downward trend. One trader on social media has spotted a historical ETH 3-year Stochastic RSI trend, which dictates that oversold levels preceded the start of an upward price rally. HISTORIC ETH SIGNAL TRIGGERED!

Every time this happened, a massive rally followed! pic.twitter.com/XZdtIw5OL7 ‚Äî Merlijn The Trader (@MerlijnTrader) March 12, 2025 Still, the prediction was dismissed by a commenter, stating: ‚ÄúNotice how the previous two times, it was during peak bear.

The community is excited and expects a massive breakout because of the increased attention this development could bring, and other recent bullish signs in the market. To see how high XRP can climb, we consulted Elon Musk‚Äôs AI, Grok, to estimate XRP‚Äôs price at the end of March 2025. XRP‚Äôs Current Market Performance As of March 12, 2025, XRP is trading at $2.23, reflecting a 1.46% increase from the previous day. After a period of consolidation, XRP is now slowly building momentum as the broader market recovers. While Grok does not provide real-time market data, it analyzes historical trends, expert opinions, and technical indicators for an informed estimate. Grok‚Äôs XRP Price Prediction Grok suggests that XRP could trade between $2.20 and $2.90 by March 31, with a midpoint estimate of $2.55. This projection is based on various sources, including technical analyses and discussions on social media. The AI tool also referenced predictions from across the crypto space. Some predictions indicate a narrower range of $2.20 to $2.38, while others suggest a wider fluctuation between $1.27 and $2.64, reflecting mixed market sentiment. Grok also referenced Coinpedia, which predicts that XRP could reach $2.40 by mid-March. While this is not as high as other projections, it implies the potential for stability after some growth from current levels. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 ‚Äî TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Factors Influencing XRP‚Äôs Price Several key factors could shape XRP‚Äôs price movement in the coming weeks. As Grok highlights, the most prominent is the resolution of the Ripple lawsuit. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has dismissed multiple lawsuits and investigations over the past few weeks. However, the regulator has yet to address the Ripple lawsuit, the most high-profile case in the crypto space. However, Fox Business journalist Eleanor Terrett recently revealed the final hurdle holding the case‚Äôs resolution back and suggested it could be settled anytime soon. The end of the legal battle would cement XRP‚Äôs regulatory clarity, and encourage more institutions to join the market. Additionally, Ripple‚Äôs partnerships and expansion in cross-border payments may support XRP‚Äôs valuation. Increased adoption of Ripple‚Äôs technology by financial institutions could strengthen demand and provide long-term price stability. Like many other analysts, Grok suggests that XRP‚Äôs immediate future is bullish . As many positive factors support its growth, the digital asset may outperform expectations.

Lee, the co-founder and head of research at Fundstrat Global Advisors, says in a new interview with CNBC that the U.S. Federal Reserve is now in a position to begin cutting rates ‚Äúbecause inflation measures are abating.‚Äù The investor notes the odds of the Fed cutting rates in May ‚Äúhave been inching up.‚Äù Current wagers on the decentralized gambling platform Polymarket suggest there‚Äôs a 33% chance the Fed will cut the policy rate by 25 basis points in two months. Lee also argues that a ‚ÄúTrump put exists.‚Äù ‚ÄúLook at yesterday, Tesla‚Äôs down 15%, and on Truth Social Donald Trump talks about Tesla. So I think a put exists, we just don‚Äôt know the level when the White House intervenes.‚Äù Lee says there are ‚Äúreally attractive opportunities‚Äù in stocks right now, especially ones that have had large drawdowns. Earlier this month, Lee warned investors that Bitcoin ( BTC ) and other crypto assets wouldn‚Äôt be immune to market turbulence. ‚ÄúThe work by our technical strategist Mark Newton [shows] Solana, Ethereum, and Bitcoin all have downsides. He has been bearish since mid-January, so I think it‚Äôs been correct and his downside target for Bitcoin is $62,000 by the end of March. But to me, is $62,000 a reason to turn bearish on Bitcoin? I mean if you‚Äôre trading it, yeah, but Bitcoin was $100 10 years ago so $60,000 is still a fantastic return and I think Bitcoin‚Äôs usefulness is still improving. It‚Äôs still a risk-on asset so I don‚Äôt expect it to do well if the market is being hit by tariffs. It‚Äôs not immune to that kind of turbulence, but is the trust around Bitcoin going to grow over the next five years? Yes, and is it going to be increasingly viewed as a store of value like gold? Yes, I think increasingly.‚Äù Don't Miss a Beat ‚Äì Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox Check Price Action Follow us on X , Facebook and Telegram Surf The Daily Hodl Mix Disclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

SEC Lawsuit Update: Is a Game-Changing Resolution on the Horizon?,https://cryptopotato.com/ripple-v-sec-lawsuit-update-is-a-game-changing-resolution-on-the-horizon/,"TL;DR Reports suggest Ripple‚Äôs legal team is negotiating better terms for the $125 million penalty, with sources indicating that the case could soon be resolved. Attorney Fred Rispoli speculates that a resolution or significant development might occur before Ripple‚Äôs appellate brief deadline, which is scheduled for April 16. The Case Could be Over Soon Despite dismissing or pausing several lawsuits against crypto businesses in the past few months, the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) continues to confront Ripple on the legal front. The tussle dates back to December 2020 , but lately, there has been increased speculation that its resolution might be just around the corner. Fox Business journalist Eleanor Terrett is the latest person to touch upon the matter. She recently revealed that two ‚Äúwell-placed sources‚Äù told her that the lawsuit ‚Äúis in the process of wrapping up and could be over soon.‚Äù According to her information, the delay in reaching an agreement is due to Ripple‚Äôs legal team negotiating more favorable terms regarding the $125 million penalty that Judge Torres slammed the company with last summer. Terrett was told that the SEC‚Äôs new leadership had been thoroughly examining the case and is now ‚Äúseemingly unsure‚Äù whether the company breached any rules. Recall that Judge Torres found that Ripple‚Äôs institutional sales of XRP tokens violated federal securities laws. ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs no real playbook for this kind of thing which could explain why this case is taking longer to resolve than the rest. Stay tuned,‚Äù the journalist concluded. Resolution Before That Date? Another person who gave his two cents is Fred Rispoli. Earlier this week, the attorney assumed that a mutual agreement or some kind of a settlement might occur before April 16. This date marks Ripple‚Äôs scheduled filing of their appellate brief. ‚ÄúAlthough there is no formal reason requiring it, it is reasonable to speculate that the SEC v. Ripple case is resolved ‚Äìor at least something significant happens‚Äìbefore Ripple‚Äôs filing deadline of April 16, 2025. Let‚Äôs keep an eye on i t‚Ä¶a nd hope,‚Äù the lawyer said. The final outcome of the case is likely to cause huge volatility for Ripple‚Äôs native token. A ruling in the company‚Äôs favor could spark a bull run for XRP, whereas the opposite scenario might lead to a significant decline. The post Ripple v.

Strategy's common stock, on the other hand, is 20% lower over the same period. Preferred stock like STRK can be thought of as a hybrid of equity and debt. Holders have a greater right to dividend payments than common stock owners if the company makes them and also to the company's assets in the event of a liquidation. STRK is a perpetual issue, which lacks a maturity date (like equity) and pays a fixed dividend (like debt). Those features mean preferred stock tends to be less volatile than the common stock. That certainly seems to be the case for STRK. According to Strategy's dashboard , STRK has a 26% correlation with MSTR and a slightly negative -7% correlation with bitcoin ( BTC ). It's also less volatile, at 49%, compared with bitcoin‚Äôs roughly 60% and MSTR‚Äôs volatility exceeding 100%. Last week, Strategy announced a $21 billion at-the-market (ATM) offering for STRK. That is, it's prepared to sell up to that amount of the stock at the current market price over a period of time. If all the STRK is sold, the company would face a total annual dividend bill of about $1.68 billion. Generating that amount of cash means the company would either to sell common stock through an ATM offering ‚Äî unlikely given the depressed share price as of late ‚Äîor use cash generated from operations or proceeds from any convertible debt raised. STRK offers an 8% annual dividend yield based on its $100 liquidation preference and at the currently price of $87.45, offers an effective yield of around 9%. As with debt, the higher the STRK price, the lower the yield, and vice versa. STRK also includes a feature allowing each share to be converted into 0.1 share of common stock, equivalent to a 10-to-1 ratio, when the MSTR price reaches or exceeds $1,000. Strategy stock closed at $262.55 on Wednesday, for the option to become viable it would have to appreciate significantly, offering potential upside beyond STRK‚Äôs fixed dividend. As an income-generating product with lower volatility, STRK presents a more stable option with potential upside. However, the massive ATM offering could impact this potential upside, similar to how ATM share sales have affected the common stock‚Äôs performance.",Markets|MicroStrategy|Bitcoin|Debt|equity,EN,0,0,STRK|BUSINESS|BTC|TRADING|MARKET,"{'name': 'CoinDesk', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coindesk.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coindesk,2025-03-13 11:48:50

Crypto analyst Steph recently shared insights on X, highlighting a bearish pattern developing in XRP‚Äôs price action. He warned that the cryptocurrency may be at risk of further losses if critical support levels fail. The pattern in question is a Head and Shoulders formation, a well-known technical indicator that often signals a potential trend reversal. While Steph initially believed the setup was unclear, recent market conditions have strengthened its formation, making it more distinct. At the time of his analysis, XRP was approaching a critical support level, with its ability to hold this threshold seen as a decisive factor in determining its short-term price direction. #XRP HUUUUUGE WARNING!!!!!!!!! pic.twitter.com/lllwRykRsN ‚Äî STEPH IS CRYPTO (@Steph_iscrypto) March 10, 2025 Key Support Level That Could Define XRP‚Äôs Trajectory As of now, the asset is trading around $2, a crucial support level that also serves as the neckline for the emerging Head and Shoulders pattern. The analyst also noted holding above this mark is essential for preventing a significant price drop. However, he emphasized that a daily or weekly close below this threshold would confirm the bearish setup. A confirmed breakdown could trigger additional selling pressure and push the price lower. Earlier yesterday, XRP briefly dipped to $1.92 before rebounding to $2.2, avoiding an immediate breakdown. Despite this recovery, analysts remain cautious, noting that the risk of further decline has not been eliminated. Potential Drop to $1.20 if Breakdown Occurs If XRP fails to maintain support at $2 and a confirmed breakdown occurs, Steph has projected a potential price decline to the range of $1.20 to $1.17. This target is derived from the Head and Shoulders pattern, with the expected drop based on the distance from the head to the neckline. Steph also pointed out that this price zone previously saw heavy trading volume in November 2024, which could act as a key support region if XRP revisits it. However, he stressed that such a decline would only be validated if the breakdown is accompanied by strong selling volume.

Analyst Ali Martinez recently issued a similar warning, suggesting that a drop to $1 is possible if XRP sustains a breakdown below $2. Martinez noted that the token has completed the right shoulder of the Head and Shoulders formation, further reinforcing the potential for a downward move. While some investors remain optimistic about the token‚Äôs long-term prospects , an increasing number of analysts are cautioning that the cryptocurrency could experience heightened volatility in the near term. As market participants monitor the token‚Äôs movements, all eyes remain on the $2 support level, which could determine whether the cryptocurrency stabilizes or continues its downward trend.

Speaking in an interview with the BBC on Wednesday, he said that the central bank remains confident despite ongoing economic uncertainties. ‚ÄúWe will achieve price stability this year,‚Äù Nagel said. ‚ÄúWe are back to our target at the end of this year‚Äîthis is good news.‚Äù The ECB‚Äôs latest projections, released last week, initially suggested inflation would reach 2% in early 2026, though they were made before a recent drop in energy prices, meaning the timeline may change sooner than expected. Global trade uncertainty messes with ECB‚Äôs inflation outlook While the inflation slowdown is encouraging, Nagel warned that Germany‚Äôs economy is at risk due to its heavy reliance on exports. He pointed directly at Donald Trump‚Äôs trade policies, saying, ‚ÄúWhen you are exposed to an export-oriented model, then you are more exposed in a situation when tariffs are going up and there are so many uncertainties, so many unknowns.‚Äù Germany, which depends on trade with the US, could face serious economic consequences if Trump imposes new tariffs on European goods. Nagel reportedly told BBC these policies might even lead to a recession this year, though he did not speculate on specific sectors that would be affected the most. Beyond the trade concerns, Nagel also addressed Europe‚Äôs push for military and infrastructure spending, urging leaders to take advantage of the opportunity. ‚ÄúNow is this window of opportunity to do more in Europe, we should have more Europe and not less Europe,‚Äù Nagel said in the Wednesday interview. While much of the discussion around spending increases has focused on defense, Nagel thinks the Eurozone should go beyond just military funding. Another ECB Governing Council member, Martins Kazaks, took a similar approach when asked about inflation concerns. He avoided making predictions about interest rate policy, citing uncertainty in global markets. ‚ÄúAt the current moment, it‚Äôs not really possible to very clearly say what the future dynamic of rates will be,‚Äù Kazaks told TV24 on Thursday. Kazaks then pointed to Trump‚Äôs potential tariff war as one of the biggest wildcards, saying it could increase certain prices across Europe. Eurozone inflation slowed in February, but risks remain The latest Eurostat data, released on March 3, showed that Eurozone inflation dropped to 2.4% in February, but it still came in slightly above expectations. Analysts surveyed by Reuters had predicted inflation to fall to 2.3%, following the 2.5% reading in January. Core inflation, which excludes volatile sectors like energy, food, alcohol, and tobacco, edged down to 2.6% in February from 2.7% in January. Services inflation, which has remained stubbornly high, declined to 3.7%, down from 3.9% in December 2024. A major reason for the overall inflation slowdown was the huge drop in energy price increases. In February, energy prices were up only 0.2%, compared to a 1.9% increase in January, and the ECB‚Äôs governing council believes this played a key role in easing overall inflation pressures. Economist Jack Allen-Reynolds said that February‚Äôs numbers indicate a downward trend in services inflation, which could help lower core inflation in the months ahead. ‚ÄúFebruary‚Äôs decline in headline inflation was encouraging because it was partly due to lower services inflation,‚Äù Allen-Reynolds said on Thursday. ‚ÄúWe think February‚Äôs decline in services inflation is the start of a trend that will pull the core rate down substantially this year.‚Äù Despite these, Bert Colijn, another economist, pointed out that inflation remains highly uncertain due to trade tensions and energy market fluctuations. ‚ÄúGeopolitical developments are making the inflation outlook highly uncertain at the moment. Think, for example, of uncertainty surrounding a trade war and energy prices,‚Äù said Colijn in a note on Wednesday. ‚ÄúFor the European Central Bank, the big question is how low it will go,‚Äù Colijn said. He added that while the March 3 inflation data confirms that inflation is cooling, it does not provide a strong case for setting a definitive terminal rate. ‚ÄúWe expect another 0.25ppt cut later this week to be accompanied by a fiercer debate on when the ECB will reach its terminal rate,‚Äù said Colijn. While inflation has moderated across the Eurozone, some countries continue to report higher-than-expected readings. In Germany, February inflation remained at 2.8%, unchanged from the previous month, while in France, inflation dropped sharply to 0.9%.

Besides, a flurry of recent market trends indicates that Ripple‚Äôs native asset might continue its rally in the coming days. So, here we explore some of the top factors that may push the asset‚Äôs price higher going forward. XRP Price Soars 4%: Breakout Incoming? XRP price soared more than 4% today and exchanged hands at $2.26, while its one-day volume fell 16% to $5.61 billion. Notably, the crypto has touched a 24-hour high and low of $2.28 and $2.14, respectively. Despite the recent volatile trading, it appears that Ripple‚Äôs native asset is gearing up for a robust rally ahead. CoinGlass data showed that XRP Futures Open Interest rose nearly 8% today, indicating the regaining confidence of investors. Besides, the recent market trends also hint towards a continuing rally ahead. Ripple Expands Into UAE Market In a significant development, Ripple has announced its entry into the UAE markets, having secured the coveted DFSA License. This milestone marks Ripple‚Äôs first license in the Middle East, enabling the company to offer its cutting-edge cross-border crypto payments services in Dubai. The UAE‚Äôs strategic location as a global hub for international trade and outbound finance, with a massive market size exceeding $400 billion, is expected to fuel XRP‚Äôs adoption. This, in turn, has bolstered investor confidence, setting the stage for a potential price surge. As Ripple‚Äôs presence in the UAE grows, XRP price is likely to benefit from increased adoption and demand. With the broader crypto market exhibiting positive momentum, XRP is poised to capitalize on this trend. Ripple SEC Settlement Bets A significant development that‚Äôs contributing to the latest XRP price surge is the impending resolution of the long-running legal battle between Ripple and the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). According to renowned crypto journalist Eleanor Terrett, Ripple‚Äôs legal team is pushing for better terms than the August 2024 District Court ruling, which imposed a $125 million fine on the firm for violating Federal Securities Laws. She also predicted that the Ripple Vs SEC case could be concluded soon. Legal expert Fred Rispoli has downplayed the role of the SEC‚Äôs delay in resolving the XRP lawsuit, stating that the case‚Äôs resolution is simpler than anticipated. This optimism has contributed to the positive momentum surrounding XRP‚Äôs price. XRP ETF Gains Momentum Asset management giant Franklin Templeton‚Äôs recent filing for an XRP ETF has sparked excitement within the XRP community. The fund, which will be custodied by Coinbase Custody Trust Company, marks a significant development in the evolving crypto ETF landscape. This development also fueled speculation that a spot XRP ETF filing from BlackRock , the world‚Äôs largest asset manager, could be on the horizon. This potential development has sparked optimism among XRP investors, who believe that a high-profile ETF filing could accelerate the approval process. Considering all these aspects and the recent surge, it appears that the XRP price is poised to continue its rally in the coming days.

GLD: What Is The Real 'Digital Gold' In A 'Risk Off' Market?,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4767166-gbtc-vs-gld-what-is-real-digital-gold-in-a-risk-off-market?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral&feed_item_type=article,"Summary The article explores the ongoing debate about digital gold, focusing on year-to-date total returns for GLD and GBTC. Gold in ETF format is becoming nearly as liquid as crypto with T+1 instituted in 2024. GLD has shown resilience in the face of a rising VIX, showing that this is the real digital gold risk off asset. GBTC and Bitcoin can both serve a place in a portfolio, but in a possible recession, investors will look for preservation of value versus appreciation. The debate about digital gold There is an emerging divergence in the conversation about what Bitcoin ( BTC ) actually represents. I covered Bitcoin in an article just once . My outlook was not one that was negative , it was merely one that discussed the various use cases. That was coverage back in 2022 when Bitcoin was only at $19K per coin. The run-up to now has been enormous. Oddly enough, this ""digital gold"" asset has actually started to see another negative year ensue even though the market is starting to become "" risk off "" in terms of equities. You would assume that both gold and Bitcoin would have the 'safe haven' reaction with investors flocking to both of those assets. President Trump even stated that the United States would start a strategic crypto reserve with Bitcoin as one of the centerpieces. Gold, on the other hand, has been resilient. For the purpose of this article I am using the SPDR Gold Shares ETF ( GLD ) as the investment of choice if an investor wants to own gold. It's an efficient ETF with very high volume and nearly $85 billion in assets invested into the fund . I'd like to compare both and give my opinion about why GLD is the better bet on ""digital gold"" at this moment in time. The Grayscale Bitcoin Trust ETF ( GBTC ) is in my opinion the equivalent vehicle for owning Bitcoin without having to find a brokerage where Bitcoin is sold directly. Chances are high that if you are not a long-time crypto investor, you probably don't have a Coinbase account or something similar that allows you to buy crypto directly. Gold is also cumbersome to store physically in large quantities and frankly a bit dangerous unless you have added home insurance policy riders to cover large quantities of gold. Crypto exchanges also have the added danger of lacking SIPC insurance whereas a securitized crypto ETF such as GBTC should have that, although it won't protect the underlying assets of the trust, just your ownership of the trust. Year-to-date total returns Data by YCharts We can see on a year-to-date basis that Gold has been the flight to safety asset whereas Bitcoin has tracked the Nasdaq on the way down with similar negative returns for the year as the VIX has spiked: Data by YCharts Use cases The use case for Bitcoin that I previously heralded in my only opinion piece on digital currency is that you are akin to a shareholder in a peer-to-peer banking system. I do believe Bitcoin has more inherent value than just a remittance system like a check in that the movement of funds is nearly instant in a cross-border situation without many checks and balances. Having worked with investors from around the world in the past, the value of this system is enormous when you consider the currency controls most countries have on outbound wires and currency conversion. It is also a hedge against a foreign investor's currency which may be in rapid depreciation. In short, I believe Bitcoin provides far more inherent value to non-US investors than it does to US investors as a whole . Gold, on the other hand, is the historical store of value currency. The US has done an excellent job securitizing gold and turning it into a digital asset like GLD. This type of investment in a trustworthy vehicle like the SPDR Gold Shares ETF is not normal in other countries where physical gold may be the only possible exposure. If you think there is less fraud in owning physical gold, think again : The demand for gold combined with unsophisticated Chinese consumers and investors unable to differentiate between 24-carat and lower quality gold has given rise to scammers,‚Äù Rein added. Reports about the rise in gold scams have been on local media and consumer protection sites such as Heimao Tousu, a third-party consumer service platform under tech giant Sina. One user who reportedly bought five gold pendants for 1,985 Chinese yuan [about $280] on online e-commerce platform Taobao said he found out the gold was fake after conducting a flame test. Fake gold gets darker or reveals a greenish color when placed under flame, while pure gold turns brighter on exposure to heat. In short as a US consumer and investor without strict outbound currency controls and the ""risk off"" hedge the Gold ETF assets present, I believe US investors get far more benefit out of owning a Gold ETF at present when the VIX is spiking. Similarities Both of these can be held digitally and then converted into fiat currency to transact with. US tax law is evolving in respect to crypto and buying goods directly using crypto in the US likely constitutes a taxable event if the coins used have capital gains versus your tax basis. In other areas of the world where tax law is slower to evolve, it's possible crypto can be exchanged freely for goods and services. More detail here from Coinbase : Taxable as capital gains Selling crypto for cash : Did you sell your crypto for U.S. dollars? You‚Äôll owe taxes if you sell your assets for more than you paid for them. If you sell at a loss, you may be able to deduct that loss on your taxes. Converting one crypto to another: When you use bitcoin to buy ether , for example, you technically have to sell your bitcoin before you buy a new asset. Because this is a sale, the IRS considers it taxable. You‚Äôll owe taxes if you sold your bitcoin for more than you paid for it. Spending crypto on goods and services: If you use bitcoin to buy a pizza, for example, you‚Äôll likely owe taxes on the transaction. To the IRS, spending crypto isn‚Äôt that much different from selling it. You need to sell the asset before it can be exchanged for a good or service, and selling crypto makes it subject to capital gains taxes. So at this point, GLD and a cryptocurrency are not extremely different. Don't forget, last year we changed settlement for brokerage securities from T+2 to T+1: T+1 settlement cycle will apply to most routine securities transactions, which means that the settlement period for most securities issuances and trades will shorten from two business days after the trade date to one business day after the trade date to one day. Thus, with the liquidity of being able to turn securities into cash within one day, a gold fund like GLD is now extremely close to an equivalent digital crypto backed by gold. Larry Fink, CEO of BlackRock, has been pushing for a tokenization of stocks and bonds. This would, in theory, make it possible to send stocks and bonds without sale and turn any stock or bond into a cryptocurrency. This would effectively make GLD a crypto equivalent, and possibly Apple and Microsoft too. Larry Fink, CEO of the world‚Äôs largest fund manager BlackRock, has expressed his hope that the US Securities and Exchange Commission SEC will swiftly approve the tokenization of bonds and stocks. During a CNBC interview on Jan. 23, Fink strongly endorsed digital assets, underscoring their potential to democratize investments. Differences Bitcoin is a 'risk on' asset Data by YCharts So if GLD is becoming more and more digital with T+1, fantastic daily liquidity, and the eventual push for tokenization, in my opinion, one of the main differences will eventually be that Bitcoin is a ' risk on' asset and GLD is risk-off. We can see that Bitcoin has risen even faster than the Nasdaq in the last 3 years and rallies around the same time. Bitcoin will remain a superior asset for countries with currency controls. The above is true, especially for the ultra-wealthy who may have trouble transferring large sums of money due to CFIUS [Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States] controls and other issues of foreign funds transfers related to exchange rates and currency controls. Having worked in a field dealing with Foreign investors, the issue was not where are the people with money, the issue was proving the source of funds and then clearing the currency controls of their native countries combined with the funds passing scrutiny once they landed in the US. With President Trump preparing to institute the new ""Gold Card"", which will, in essence, be a $5 million version of a Green Card where the investor moves to the front of the line and gets expedited processing, Bitcoin may be key. Moving such large sums may be difficult otherwise. The strategic crypto reserve might be set up to be able to take inbound contributions from such investments. While the Gold Card doesn't have many details yet, my guess is, it will be a zero coupon type bond with no accrued interest for a 5-10-year period. This is similar to programs in New Zealand and Singapore. Summary I believe in a volatile environment, GLD serves as the true ""digital gold"" and could have similar outperformance in a high VIX environment to that of long bonds and more conservative income-producing equities like REITs and dividend aristocrats/kings. Bitcoin and GBTC are more suited for a calmer VIX with a ' risk on' environment, but I do believe the asset is of use, especially when it comes to cross-border transactions. Right now, GLD is a buy and GBTC is a hold in my opinion.",BTC|GLD|GBTC,EN,0,0,FIAT|BTC|BUSINESS|REGULATION|MARKET,"{'name': 'Seeking Alpha', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/seekingalpha.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",seekingalpha,2025-03-13 11:56:48

Analyst Explained His Expectation!,https://en.bitcoinsistemi.com/critical-warning-came-for-ethereum-eth-analyst-explained-his-expectation/,"Ethereum (ETH) continues to fall against Bitcoin, leading analysts to expect further declines in the coming weeks. The ETH/BTC parity fell to $0.022 on March 13. This level is the lowest since May 2020, while the RSI also fell to a record low of 23.32. Typically when the RSI drops below 30 it signals an oversold condition and potentially a price recovery. However, as the Ethereum price continues to fall further for two months even after the RSI entered the oversold territory, analysts say that the data shows that ETH is still in a downtrend. As Ethereum falls to multi-year lows, analysts predict that ETH could face the risk of further declines in the face of competition. At this point, crypto analyst Alessandro Ottaviani warned that buying ETH in the current situation is like catching a ‚Äúfalling knife‚Äù and that further declines could still occur. ‚ÄúETH/BTC also broke the 0.023 support level. Ethereum is a falling knife and the downtrend is accelerating.‚Äù The term Falling Knife is often used to describe an asset that is experiencing a rapid and steep decline, which discourages buyers from jumping in too early. This term means that trying to buy the asset at lower levels could result in further losses if the downtrend continues. *This is not investment advice.

The content and materials featured on this page are for educational purposes only. BitLemons is turning heads with real revenue, live games, and a nearly sold-out presale, while SOL and DOT struggle to find their footing. Table of Contents BLEM could be the market‚Äôs hidden ace SOL faces harsh market realities DOT proves it‚Äôs more than just hype Is BLEM the ultimate hedge against market volatility? A month ago, Solana was soaring, and Polkadot was climbing. Now, SOL is down 38%, and DOT has lost 8.6%, leaving traders searching for the next breakout play. The problem? Hype doesn‚Äôt hold up when revenue dries up, and technical breakthroughs don‚Äôt translate to gains. That‚Äôs why BitLemons (BLEM) is attracting serious attention. With a fully operational gaming platform, continuous revenue streaming in, and staking rewards already live, its presale is selling out fast. Investors are getting in before the next price hike, and with a $1m giveaway still open, the timing couldn‚Äôt be better. BLEM could be the market‚Äôs hidden ace Forget speculative tokens with no utility; BitLemons is already a revenue-generating machine. This web3 casino has officially launched, boasting 8,000+ games from industry leaders like Evolution and Pragmatic. But it doesn‚Äôt stop there, three original BitLemons-exclusive games (BLEM Keno, Crash, and Wheel of BitLemons) are driving profits higher by eliminating third-party fees. Investors aren‚Äôt just buying into hype; they‚Äôre buying into revenue. BitLemons allocates 30% of all Gross Gaming Revenue (GGR) to token holders, split between 15% for strategic buybacks and burns and 15% for staking rewards. Unlike tokens relying purely on price speculation, BLEM is backed by continuous earnings. Momentum is building fast, Stage 2 of the presale is 93% sold out, with over 30.4 million BLEM tokens snapped up. The next price increase is just days away, jumping from $0.02 to $0.03 per BLEM. And with a rumored listing price between $0.17-$0.18, early investors are eyeing substantial gains. Strategic partnerships are also brewing, with whispers of high-profile influencers and sports celebrities set to push BitLemons into the mainstream. With the casino live and revenue rolling in, the roadmap is stacked with more games, more incentives, and more reasons for investors to take notice. You might also like: Will TRX or PI outpace BitLemons in the 2025 crypto race? SOL faces harsh market realities Solana has been a dominant force in the crypto world, but the past month has been brutal. SOL‚Äôs price has tumbled 38%, recently dropping below $120, its lowest level since February 2024. The sell-off has been fueled by declining on-chain revenue, with SOL‚Äôs weekly earnings collapsing from $55.3 million to just $4 million, a staggering 93% decline. The hype around Solana-based memecoins has faded, taking much of the network‚Äôs transaction volume with it. Compounding the issue, Solana‚Äôs Total Value Locked (TVL) has halved, falling from $12 billion to $6.4 billion. Market sentiment is skittish, and with resistance forming at $130-$135, bulls have their work cut out for them. If selling pressure persists, SOL could dip below $110, raising concerns among traders. DOT proves it‚Äôs more than just hype While SOL faces headwinds, Polkadot is making headlines for all the right reasons. The network just accomplished a groundbreaking feat, running the classic game DOOM entirely on-chain. This experiment is more than just a nostalgic gimmick, it highlights Polkadot‚Äôs unmatched decentralized computing capabilities. Despite this innovation, DOT hasn‚Äôt been immune to market pressures. Over the past week, the token has dipped 8.6%, currently sitting around $3.94. Trading volume has nosedived 33.5%, reflecting caution among investors. However, analysts suggest DOT is nearing a crucial support zone at $3.80. If it holds, a strong rebound could be in play, with potential price targets of $6.40 and $10.80. Is BLEM the ultimate hedge against market volatility? While major tokens like SOL and DOT battle uncertainty, BitLemons is already generating cash flow. It‚Äôs a fully operational platform, not just an idea on a whitepaper. With high-yield staking, a deflationary token model, and continuous revenue streams, BLEM is defying the market‚Äôs typical boom-and-bust cycles. The presale‚Äôs near sellout is no coincidence. Institutional investors and crypto whales are positioning themselves before the next price jump. Once Stage 3 kicks in at $0.03 per BLEM, the path to a major price surge could begin.

BRO may appeal to institutions who wish to invest in BTC as a store of value in a similar way to Strategy (as MicroStrategy is now called) but without physically purchasing and holding it themselves. Furthermore, they may be seeking a more active yield-generating form of BTC investment.

41589200,https://blockworks.co/news/walletconnect-future-onchain-connectivity,1741867200,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/blockworks.png,WalletConnect: The Key to the Future of Onchain Connectivity,https://blockworks.co/news/walletconnect-future-onchain-connectivity,"In the ever-expanding onchain economy, WalletConnect has solidified itself as the universal connection layer, enabling seamless interactions between users, wallets, apps and blockchains. As new connection methods and technologies emerge, does this threaten WalletConnect‚Äôs relevance? The answer is clear: WalletConnect remains indispensable. Rather than being overshadowed, it continues to adapt, ensuring a seamless, secure and decentralized user experience. Much like HTML standards were foundational to the internet, WalletConnect remains the bedrock for onchain interoperability. The Challenges of Fragmentation WalletConnect initially provided a much-needed solution for secure wallet-app interactions. However, as the onchain economy matures, numerous connection formats have emerged, offering users various authentication and signing methods. While this innovation signals progress, it also introduces complexity. Developers and users must now navigate an array of options, including embedded wallets, smart contract wallets, and alternative connection layers. Though each has its advantages, the lack of a unified infrastructure can lead to inefficiencies, security risks, and a poor user experience. Many of these solutions still require a robust, decentralized infrastructure, exactly what WalletConnect provides. Fragmentation also creates challenges for developers, who must integrate multiple connection standards to ensure compatibility. WalletConnect resolves this by acting as an adaptable bridge, ensuring interoperability regardless of how connection methods evolve. WalletConnect: A Universal Connection Layer Unlike single-purpose connection standards, WalletConnect functions as a bridge, supporting multiple authentication and interaction methods. This adaptability ensures developers can future-proof their applications, integrating emerging technologies without overhauling existing systems. Projects like Reown AppKit, RainbowKit, and Privy leverage WalletConnect‚Äôs infrastructure to enhance wallet interactions, proving its continued relevance. Apps and exchanges such as Zealy, Nansen, Kraken Exchange, ChainGPT, and over 56,000 others rely on WalletConnect for seamless integration. Wallet providers, including TrustWallet, MetaMask, Binance Wallet, BitGet Wallet, and OKX Wallet, also use WalletConnect technology. Additionally, users can switch between desktop and mobile effortlessly, making onchain experiences more intuitive. As new formats emerge, WalletConnect evolves to ensure a frictionless connection across the expanding onchain ecosystem. Smart Sessions removes the need for users to approve every action while maintaining security. Soon, users will be able to ‚Äúconnect and forget,‚Äù immersing themselves in the onchain experience without friction. By reducing transaction approval fatigue while maintaining security, Smart Sessions further establishes WalletConnect as the foundational connection layer. Future-Proofing Through Decentralization A core differentiator of WalletConnect is its decentralized infrastructure, ensuring resilience and scalability. Unlike proprietary solutions, WalletConnect operates under a governance model that empowers its community and a robust network of node operators, including industry leaders such as Ledger, Kiln, Luga Nodes, Sensei Nodes, Consensys, 1kx, Figment, Everstake, Arc Community, Nansen, Chain Safe, HexTrust, NodeMonster, QuantNode, and CryptoMind. This community-driven model ensures WalletConnect evolves based on real-world needs rather than centralized decisions. Decentralization also eliminates single points of failure. Many authentication solutions today rely on third-party providers, which can introduce security vulnerabilities. WalletConnect‚Äôs decentralized nature removes this dependency, reinforcing trust in its infrastructure. As governance mechanisms evolve, WalletConnect‚Äôs community-led approach ensures adaptability to future technological and regulatory shifts. Through onchain voting, protocol upgrades, and open-source collaboration, the network continues refining its capabilities to serve users and developers alike. Expanding WalletConnect‚Äôs Role Looking ahead, WalletConnect is set to deepen its role by integrating with emerging standards and expanding its utility across different onchain sectors. Its infrastructure supports diverse use cases, from DeFi and gaming to enterprise applications. By remaining community-led and responsive to technological advancements, WalletConnect ensures users always have access to the most efficient, secure, and seamless connection experience. Future developments may include extended support for new blockchain networks and Layer 2 solutions, further strengthening its role as a universal connector. As the onchain economy grows, WalletConnect remains the adaptable, user-governed infrastructure enabling seamless, decentralized connectivity. Rather than competing with new connection methods, it enhances them, ensuring interoperability across the ecosystem. The future of onchain interactions is not about one dominant connection method, but rather a cohesive framework uniting them all. By upholding decentralization, user choice, and interoperability, WalletConnect remains the essential foundation for the next generation of onchain experiences.

Over the past three months, it has experienced record levels of active selling, losing over 50% as its price dropped from $3,993 to the current level of under $1,900. But there could be an opportunity for buyers. Ethereum Hits Oversold Zone Qiao Wang, a prominent figure in the crypto industry and founder of Alliance DAO, recently pointed out that Ethereum (ETH) is currently at a historically oversold level similar to previous major downturns. He compared the current ETH market sentiment to key past events: the 2021 Terra collapse, the 2018 deep bear market when ETH was infamously labeled a ‚Äútwo-digit shitcoin,‚Äù and the aftermath of the 2016 DAO hack. Each of these moments marked extreme pessimism yet proved to be prime buying opportunities for long-term investors. As such, Wang‚Äôs observation suggests that the current ETH price might be approaching a point of undervaluation. ‚ÄúHowever poor the outlook is for given asset, there is a price at which it makes sense to own it. but to answer ur question, if anything, eth is still the most likely place for institutional adoption to happen.‚Äù Along the same lines, crypto analyst ‚ÄúMerlijn The Trader‚Äù noted that Ethereum‚Äôs 3-year Stochastic RSI has hit oversold levels. This indicator, which measures momentum and identifies potential trend reversals, has historically signaled major buying opportunities when deeply oversold. According to Merlijn, every previous occurrence of this signal was followed by a significant rally in the crypto asset, which suggests that a potential bullish reversal could be on the horizon. Moreover, Ethereum has also witnessed significant whale accumulation in recent weeks. This trend may suggest that many holders see current levels as a strategic buying opportunity. ETH Bulls Watch for Turnaround Despite the bearish sentiment currently impacting the broader crypto market, Ethereum may find a catalyst for recovery through positive developments. For instance, the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has acknowledged Fidelity‚Äôs proposal to introduce staking within its spot Ethereum ETF (FETH), with Grayscale and 21Shares also filing for similar approvals. If granted, these changes could boost investor confidence and drive demand. Additionally, Ethereum‚Äôs upcoming Pectra upgrade, which aims to improve user experience with improved features, is progressing steadily, having already been finalized on the Holesky and Sepolia testnets. As the mainnet launch nears, it could help reignite ETH‚Äôs price momentum.

Don‚Äôt worry, though, as it‚Äôs a bullish prediction this time around. Capo, who has around 950K followers on X, said that the current dip in Bitcoin prices might be a bear trap. Although Bitcoin plummeted to $76K, which is lower than what was expected, Capo believes that the bottom is not far away. He expects a strong bounce from current $BTC levels. The most interesting piece of prediction by Capo is that the upcoming crypto rally will be led by altcoins. He put his wizard-like technical analysis skills to work and said that most altcoins have hit major support after a strong correction. However, he also ushered a word of caution that Bitcoin needs to come back to and hold the $84K levels for a bullish continuation. Currently, $BTC is trading at around $83,236 . To further prove his analysis, Capo pointed to the TOTAL2 chart. It‚Äôs an index that tracks the market cap of all crypto assets barring Bitcoin and stablecoins. It has held the key support levels of $971B, suggesting a good bullish setup. Rumble Buys More Bitcoin While retailers are panic selling Bitcoin, smart and long-term investors are using this as an opportunity to add the ‚Äòdigital gold‚Äô to their portfolio. Rumble, the popular video-sharing platform, added around 188 Bitcoins at an average price of $91K per coin. That‚Äôs $17M in total. This is part of the company‚Äôs strategy against increasing inflation and currency dilution. We are proud to officially hold Bitcoin as we continue to grow and engrain crypto into our company‚Äôs DNA ‚Äì Chris Pavlovski, Rumble CEO In other news, Michael Saylor‚Äôs MSTR plans to buy more $BTC, too. It currently holds over 500K tokens worth $42B. It‚Äôs worth noting that institutions like these are not bothered by short-term price fluctuations. They‚Äôre backing crypto for the long term. As mentioned above, the best altcoins are expected to outshine Bitcoin in the coming crypto rally. Bitcoin is still a fantastic store of wealth, no doubt, but if you want a chance at generating breathtaking returns, here are the most promising altcoins to buy. 1. BTC Bull Token ($BTCBULL) ‚Äì The Most Promising Altcoin to Buy Right Now With altcoins set to overtake Bitcoin in crypto‚Äôs next leg up higher, a project like BTC Bull Token ($BTCBULL) that‚Äôs fundamentally a meme coin but is designed to follow the coattails of $BTC might just be your best bet. The developers will hand out free $BTC every time the crypto surges past a new milestone figure. The next one is $150K, for instance, followed by $200K, $250K, and so on. Given that BTC Bull Token is the only crypto offering real $BTC as a reward to token holders, it‚Äôs undoubtedly one of the best cryptos to buy before the market explodes. Furthermore, thanks to regular token burns and marketing events, as well as $BTCBULL‚Äôs low buying price, the token is highly likely to see a massive price jump. Where $BTC might give you a 100x return in the next 4-5 years, BTC Bull Token could do that in just a few hours after listing. One thing to note is that to get free $BTC, you must buy and hold $BTCBULL in the Best Wallet app . The good news is that you can buy a token for just $0.00241 as it‚Äôs currently in presale. Here‚Äôs how to buy BTC Bull Token . 2. Solaxy ($SOLX) ‚Äì Solana Altcoin with Real-Life Application Solana has emerged as the go-to blockchain for meme coins thanks to its fast transaction speeds and low fees. However, it has recently lost much of its charm because of the overwhelming response from altcoin investors. The launch of $TRUMP and Pump.fun, in particular, brought in a wave of new investors to Solana, and it has been struggling to cater to all of them. In comes Solaxy ($SOLX) , the first-ever Layer 2 solution on Solana. It‚Äôs a revolutionary token that will relieve Solana‚Äôs pain points ‚Äì network congestion, failed transactions, and limited scalability. Solaxy will do so by processing transactions off-chain, i.e., on a sidechain rather than on Solana‚Äôs mainnet. Additionally, it will carry out transactions in batches, which will increase Solana‚Äôs affordability. An altcoin with real utility, Solaxy, is predicted to reach $0.2 by 2030 . That‚Äôs a nearly 120x gain if you buy it now for only $0.001662. The price is so low because the token is in presale. It has already raised over $26M, showcasing just how much investors like it. For anyone interested, here‚Äôs how to buy Solaxy . 3. Cardano ($ADA) ‚Äì One of the Five Altcoins in the US Crypto Reserve Cardano saw an immediate 60% jump in its price as soon as Trump announced its inclusion in the National Crypto Reserve. It‚Äôs now the ninth biggest crypto in the world in terms of market capitalization ($25.3B+). The blockchain network is also relentlessly working on enhancing its utility. For instance, it has joined hands with Check Point to leverage cutting-edge AI technology and set new benchmarks in smart contract security. Additionally, Cardano is also aiming to improve its compatibility with Ethereum. This will help it gain a stronger footing in gaming and DeFi. Currently trading at $0.7185 , our in-depth Cardano price prediction for 2025 says that the token could reach up to $3.10 in the next few months. Final Verdict Although the above-mentioned altcoins carry the potential to grow exponentially, it‚Äôs worth remembering that the market guarantees nothing. So, you should only jump in with an amount you‚Äôre happy sidelining. An amount that doesn‚Äôt hurt your sleep, in other words. Also, please do your own research before investing.

OWNB includes Bitcoin treasury companies and miners, providing indirect leveraged exposure to Bitcoin while mitigating concentration risk through quarterly rebalancing and a 20% cap on largest holdings. The ETF aims to balance higher beta to Bitcoin with reduced volatility compared to fully leveraged ETFs, appealing to moderately risk-tolerant investors. Increased corporate adoption of Bitcoin as a reserve asset could drive potential upside for OWNB, benefiting from the growing trend of Bitcoin treasury strategies. Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) continues to prove to be an in-demand asset, with investment vehicles being built around it. The spot Bitcoin ETFs launched early last year were a success. By the numbers, iShares Bitcoin Trust ( IBIT ) was among the top three ETFs with the highest inflow in 2024. IBIT recorded $37 billion in inflows last year. Bitwise Bitcoin Standard Corporations ETF (Bitwise) As more publicly traded companies continue to adopt Bitcoin treasury strategy, Bitwise, the fund manager of the Bitwise Bitcoin ETF ( BITB ), has launched another Bitcoin ETF . This new ETF tracks publicly traded companies holding at least 1,000 Bitcoin in their corporate treasuries. OWNB top 10 holdings (Bitwise) The Bitwise Bitcoin Standard Corporations ETF (OWNB) is another avenue to Bitcoin exposure for investors interested in amplified BTC exposure. This ETF invests in publicly traded companies with significant Bitcoin exposure, giving investors an indirect leveraged exposure to Bitcoin-heavy companies. OWNB holds Bitcoin treasury companies like Strategy ( MSTR ) and Metaplanet ( OTC:MTPLF ). The ETF also includes top Bitcoin miners like MARA Holdings ( MARA ), Riot Platforms ( RIOT ), and CleanSpark ( CLSK ). The ETF automatically assigns a 1.5% weighting to any eligible companies whose bitcoin holdings comprise less than 33% of their current assets, and caps the largest holding to 20% of the fund‚Äôs total assets. Why I Might Consider OWNB for Amplified Bitcoin Exposure Every investor has a varying risk appetite. Some investors are willing to take on the risk of higher-beta exposure to an inherently risky asset like Bitcoin. We have seen increased activity in Bitcoin options trades, while on the other side of the divide, the less risky spot ETFs have also been popular. The Block Bitwise‚Äôs OWNB strikes me as the ETF that sits in the middle ground between direct 1:1 exposure to BTC (through the spot ETFs) and high risk leverage exposure through Bitcoin options or leveraged ETFs like the 2X Bitcoin Strategy ETF ( BITX ). I think OWNB will appeal to the segment of the market that is moderately risk tolerant. OWNB isn't directly leveraged; however, some of its holdings have leveraged exposure to BTC. As of the initial rebalance at the ETF launch, MSTR and MTPLF are such leveraged BTC bets in the top ten holdings of OWNB alongside stocks like RIOT and CLSK, which have operational but not financial leverage to Bitcoin exposure. What this means for the investor is that OWNB can offer higher beta to BTC than a spot ETF, while avoiding the higher volatility and risks of fully leveraged Bitcoin ETFs like BITX. The OWNB risk is adjusted because the fund holds not just equity of Bitcoin treasury companies, but also those of Bitcoin miners. I believe OWNB will also be less sensitive to short-term price swings compared to fully leveraged ETFs that use derivatives and typically rebalance daily. OWNB rebalances quarterly, and this gives investors potentially more stable performance. On each quarterly rebalance, OWNB limits the largest holding in the ETF to 20% as a way to mitigate concentration risk. This way, no single holding dominates the ETF and the ETF continually maintains its diversified portfolio. And the ETF‚Äôs diversification is kept well-rounded with the mix of both Bitcoin treasury companies and Bitcoin miners, providing a sort of ‚Äúhybrid‚Äù exposure to the different ways businesses gain Bitcoin exposure and generate value from it. The inclusion of Bitcoin miners potentially dilutes the leverage effect and risk of OWNB compared to if the fund holds and tracks Bitcoin treasury companies solely whose balance sheets are more directly leveraged to Bitcoin. Miners‚Äô exposure to Bitcoin is more operational rather than financially leveraged. Miners do not typically need to issue debt to gain Bitcoin. Their inclusion in the ETF tempers the leverage risk of OWNB, but also reduces the potential upside during Bitcoin bull markets. It's a trade-off between higher upside potential and reduced leverage risk. Overall, the choice of gaining 1:1 exposure through spot ETFs, direct leveraged exposure through leveraged ETFs, or playing in the middle ground by gaining indirect leveraged exposure to Bitcoin through OWNB lies on the risk appetite of the investor and the short- or long-term investment goals of the investor. Risk While I've mentioned that the OWNB ETF offers indirectly leveraged exposure to Bitcoin through Bitcoin-exposed equities, and is potentially less risky than fully leveraged ETFs like BITX due to its diversified portfolio of equities and quarterly rebalancing, it is worth mentioning that as a Bitcoin exposed ETF, OWNB is still highly influenced by the price movements of Bitcoin as all its underlying equities are Bitcoin-exposed. The indirect exposure doesn't eliminate Bitcoin's inherent volatility risk for investors. Takeaway Bitwise OWNB is a novel and interesting ETF concept that will appeal to investors seeking a middle ground between amplified Bitcoin exposure and lower leverage risk. Bitcoin and Bitcoin-exposed stocks have seen volatility and downside recently; however. Bitcoin‚Äôs recognition as a reserve asset has increased lately. Now that the Bitcoin reserve strategy has been announced by President Trump's administration, I believe that there is growing incentive among corporations to adopt Bitcoin treasury strategy. More adoption means more potential upside for Bitcoin. And an ETF like OWNB that tracks corporate adoption will mostly benefit from this trend.",BTC-USD|BITX|OWNB,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|REGULATION|FIAT|TRADING,"{'name': 'Seeking Alpha', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/seekingalpha.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",seekingalpha,2025-03-13 12:12:56

Our Bitcoin price prediction expects BTC‚Äôs price to reach $160K by the end of 2025 due to the bullish sentiment following the halving event. By 2031, BTC might touch $350,548 following increased institutional adoption. Bitcoin‚Äôs value struggled throughout February, enduring significant downturns. On February 27, the cryptocurrency dropped steeply, falling below $78,000 for the first time in more than three months. Analysis of on-chain data suggests that the decrease was largely driven by sell-offs from ‚ÄúBitcoin tourists‚Äù‚Äînewcomers to the trading scene. Since the beginning of 2024, Bitcoin‚Äôs price has doubled, but it has seen a notable 45% increase in just the two weeks following the presidential election. This boost has solidified Bitcoin‚Äôs role in the so-called ‚ÄúTrump trade,‚Äù with the president-elect‚Äôs positive stance on the cryptocurrency industry fueling investor optimism about this emerging asset class. As Bitcoin‚Äôs on-chain activities surge, questions arise, such as: ‚ÄúDoes Bitcoin have the potential to hold above the $100K mark?‚Äù or ‚ÄúWill Bitcoin go up?‚Äù or ‚ÄúWhere will Bitcoin be in 5 years?‚Äù Let‚Äôs answer them using our Bitcoin price prediction.

Will BTC reach $1 million? $1 million is a significant milestone for the BTC price. However, it is achievable if Bitcoin continues to attract institutional interest in the coming years. Is Bitcoin a good long-term investment? As several institutions continue to accumulate BTC and Bitcoin faces a rise in global recognition, Bitcoin has a solid long-term future. Recent news/opinions on BTC According to SoSoValue, Bitcoin ETFs faced $275.83 million in net outflows on Feb. 27, 2025, pushing the week‚Äôs total net outflows to $2.71 billion. Bitcoin price prediction March 2025 February was the reddest month for Bitcoin since June 2022, when the world‚Äôs largest cryptocurrency‚Äôs performance was -37.28 %. According to crypto data provider Santiment, Bitcoin whales and sharks have dumped ~6,813 coins since last week, which is the largest drop since last July. Will the BTC price recover in March 2025? Bitcoin‚Äôs price might attempt to maintain an average price of $89,000 and be pushed further, at least $95,000 if strong downward pressures are not seen. However, we might see a rejection on the bearish side, leading to a consolidation at around $72,000. Bitcoin Price Prediction Potential Low Potential Average Potential High Bitcoin Price Prediction March 2025 $72,000 $89,000 $95,000 Bitcoin price prediction 2025 Historically, Bitcoin has been a significant crypto coin in the year following a halving, and it is expected to push up its price. Bitcoin miners might play a crucial role in holding bullish sentiment for future price movements. Bitcoin spot ETFs are projected to be a key driver of Bitcoin prices and the broader cryptocurrency market in 2025. Furthermore, there is an increasing bullish sentiment that the base interest rates could be cut in the US, and thus, help to further the upward movement of Bitcoin . An outcome of which the 2025 year could be positive for Bitcoin, with its crypto-price perhaps touching $160,000 at the highest and the low could be around $95,000.

However, more financial products including a surge in ETF demand might hold BTC prices within a bullish region. We might see a maximum price of $185,000, with a minimum price of $115,000 and average price of $130,000. However, BitMEX Ceo Arthur Hayes predicted the BTC price to touch $700K in 2026. Bitcoin price prediction 2027 Based on a detailed technical analysis of past Bitcoin price data, it is projected that in 2027, Bitcoin could see a minimum price of $140,491.

Cryptopolitan‚Äôs Bitcoin (BTC) Price Prediction At Cryptopolitan, we are bullish on Bitcoin‚Äôs future price as the historical market sentiment is extremely impressive. By the end of 2025, Bitcoin might record a maximum of $160,000, with a minimum price of $95,000 and an average price of $120,000. However, the future market potential for Bitcoin entirely depends on its buying demand, regulation, and investor sentiment in long-term holding. We expect Bitcoin price to reach a high of $216,000 by the end of 2027. Bitcoin historic price sentiment BTC price history | Coinmarketcap Satoshi Nakamoto created Bitcoin in 2009, marking the first use of blockchain technology. Bitcoin was initially of little value, gaining significant traction and hitting over $15,000 during the 2017 boom, with further highs reached in 2019 and 2021. In 2021, Bitcoin peaked at $68,789.63 but dropped to $15,760 by December 2022 amid economic pressures, including inflation and geopolitical conflicts. By April 10, 2023, Bitcoin‚Äôs price surged 83%, breaking the $30,000 resistance level. Throughout mid-2023, Bitcoin‚Äôs value hovered around $30,000, nearly reaching $32,000 due to positive market sentiments and potential ETF approvals. Bitcoin experienced a significant price drop in mid-August 2023, falling to $25,000. However, its prices remained volatile, fluctuating between $26,000 and $29,500 in October. Bitcoin closed 2023 above $42,000, a 155% increase from the year‚Äôs start. In early 2024, Bitcoin rose above $45,000 on ETF anticipation but briefly dipped below $40,000 after approvals. It broke its 2021 all-time high in March, reaching $73,750.07 on March 14, before dropping below $60,000 in April. May saw another surge above $70,000, while June and July brought heavy fluctuations between $70K and $55K.

Support and Resistance Levels hanging near previous trigger positions $0.0040 , $0.0075 , $0.012 The new remittance-focused developments could not overcome the technical, resulting in weak momentum. Telcoin‚Äôs Price Struggles TEL/USDT has been struggling this week, dropping 35.61% in price. Even with bullish developments, the price action left much to be desired, indicating that technical factors currently override fundamentals in short term. Telcoin price is now testing its key support at $0.0050; if this fails, the next potential target for downside is $0.0040 (200-day SMA). Resistance levels at $0.0075 and $0.012 must be reclaimed for any bullish momentum to build. With 24-hour trading volume at 3.69M down 35.09% from the previous day, TEL is back in the downtrend. The RSI at under 40 displays overall weakness still. The first sign of recovery should be the rise above $0.0075. Telcoin On-Chain Vibes Good With Holder Sentiment At the current Telcoin‚Äôs (TEL) price of $0.005816, 98.31% of the total supply analyzed indicate that most holders acquired TEL at lower prices and are in profit. This suggests strong investor confidence and lower selling pressure at current levels. Conversely, only 1.48% of TEL holders are ‚ÄúOut of the Money,‚Äù meaning a small portion of investors bought at higher prices and are at a loss. Additionally, 0.21% of TEL holders are at breakeven, having purchased the asset near its current price. Historical data shows that in September 2024, TEL was trading at $0.001349, with 53.08% of holders in profit and 45.31% at a loss. The significant increase in profitable holders today suggests a strong bullish trend over time. However, potential resistance zones could emerge if TEL approaches $0.0070-$0.0075, as some loss-making holders may seek to exit. On the other hand, critical support may form in the $0.0040-$0.0045 range, where some profitable holders might accumulate more tokens. Overall, with a dominant percentage of profitable holders (98.31%), Telcoin‚Äôs on-chain data reflects positive market sentiment, low immediate sell pressure, and the potential for further price appreciation if key resistance levels are breached. Can Telcoin Regain Bullish Momentum? Despite the recent 35% price drop, Telcoin‚Äôs on-chain data indicates strong investor confidence, with 98.31% of holders still in profit and low immediate sell pressure. However, technical resistance at $0.0075 and $0.012 must be overcome for bullish momentum to return. If support at $0.0040 holds, accumulation could provide a base for recovery. A sustained move above $0.0075 would signal the first sign of strength, making it crucial for traders to watch upcoming price action closely.

The study reveals that in 2024, the number of Bitso‚Äôs Latin American clients grew by 12%, reflecting a broader shift toward digital asset investment. Notably, 38% of users now hold at least three different cryptocurrencies, indicating a preference for more sophisticated investment strategies. Stablecoins Gain Popularity Amid Economic Challenges With inflation and currency devaluation impacting multiple Latin American economies, stablecoins such as USDC and USDT have become key assets for preserving value. The report shows that 39% of total crypto purchases in 2024 were in stablecoins, up from 30% in 2023. Meanwhile, Bitcoin purchases dropped to 22%, a decline from 38% in 2023. This trend is largely attributed to Bitcoin‚Äôs increasing price and the rise of the ‚ÄúHODL‚Äù (Hold On for Dear Life) strategy. While Ethereum (ETH) and Solana (SOL) maintained their market positions with 5% and 4% of total purchases, respectively, interest in meme coins surged. PEPE‚Äôs purchase volume increased by nearly 5 percentage points, while Dogecoin (DOGE) climbed to 2%, signaling heightened speculative interest in these tokens. Another standout performer in the region was XRP, which saw a resurgence in popularity, reaching 9% of total purchases. Furthermore, while 25 to 34-year-olds continue to be the dominant crypto investors (34%), older generations are showing greater interest. Investors aged 45 to 54 increased their trading activity from 13% to 14%, while the 55 to 64 age group grew from 5% to 6%. ¬°Orgullosamente #HechoEnM√©xico !

The report highlights that Bitso Alpha users executed an average of 32 trades in December 2024, reflecting increased financial education and a more strategic approach to crypto trading. Regional Trends Driving Crypto Growth Cryptocurrency adoption is accelerating across Latin America , fueled by economic challenges and increasing financial awareness. In Argentina, where inflation has exceeded 100%, stablecoins have become a crucial hedge against economic uncertainty. With relaxed capital controls, adoption surged, driving an 11% increase in Bitso‚Äôs user base to 1.6 million. Brazil also saw steady growth, thanks to regulatory clarity and a booming tech ecosystem. The country‚Äôs crypto user base expanded by 6% to 1.9 million, with stablecoins making up 26% of purchases‚Äîa reflection of concerns over real depreciation and the rise of decentralized finance (DeFi). In Colombia, restrictions on holding U.S. dollar bank accounts have made stablecoins the preferred alternative for investors. Meanwhile, Mexico remains Bitso‚Äôs largest market, where cross-border payments continue to drive crypto adoption. Bitcoin and USDT lead the market, with the peso‚Äôs 23% depreciation further pushing demand for stablecoins. This trend contributed to a 13% rise in Bitso‚Äôs user base, reaching 4.4 million.

Deputy Minister Ivan Chebeskov, during a TASS interview, underlined the ministry‚Äôs stance on crypto legalization. ‚ÄúNot only do we affirm this, but we have worked with the central bank. As you see, the Ministry of Finance has always believed that the market of digital currency should be maximally regulated and legalized.‚Äù ‚Äì Ivan Chebeskov Bank of Russia and MinFin Agree on Regulation Chebeskov indicated that the ministry and Bank of Russia agreed on an experimental legal regime under which the regulator reforms are to be implemented.

We hope that this is one more step towards further legalisation of virtual currencies in our country. Naturally, no one is talking about settlements within the country.

Requirements for eligibility include investment of more than 100 million Russian rubles in securities and deposits or more than 50 million Russian rubles per year in annual income. Outlook on Russia‚Äôs Crypto Future The move towards the launch of a regulated crypto infrastructure is an important step in Russia‚Äôs shifting mindset towards virtual currencies.

What‚Äôs next for ETH? Technical Analysis By Edris Derakhshi (TradingRage) The Daily Chart The Ethereum daily chart shows a clear downtrend over the past few weeks, with the price consistently making lower highs and lower lows. The breakdown below multiple key support levels, including the 200-day moving average (DMA), signaled a shift in market sentiment toward bearishness. Recently, ETH has dropped below the psychological $2,000 level, testing a significant support zone around $1,900. If selling pressure continues, further downside potential toward $1,600 exists. The RSI is also hovering in oversold territory, suggesting a possible short-term bounce. However, as long as ETH remains below the key $2,400 level, any recovery could be temporary. Bulls need to reclaim this level and the 200-day moving average to reverse the downtrend, while further weakness could lead to a deeper correction. The 4-Hour Chart The 4-hour chart shows a descending wedge formation, which is typically a bullish reversal pattern. The price is now testing the $1,900 support zone, and if the level holds, it may attempt to push higher toward $2,000 and possibly the $2,100 resistance line. However, failure to rebound from the $1,900 could lead to a breakdown of the wedge, which could make everything much worse. On the other hand, a decisive breakout above the wedge with strong volume could confirm a bullish reversal, while continued consolidation or rejection at resistance may indicate further downside pressure. Sentiment Analysis By Edris Derakhshi (TradingRage) Open Interest The Ethereum Open Interest (OI) chart provides valuable insights into market positioning and trader sentiment. We can observe a significant decline in both price and OI, suggesting a strong deleveraging event. Historically, spikes in OI followed by rapid drops indicate liquidation cascades, where overleveraged long positions are flushed out, often leading to further downward momentum. The recent OI drop aligns with ETH breaking below key support levels around $2,000 and falling toward $1,800. Given this data, ETH might be in a phase of reduced speculation as traders close positions amid uncertainty. This aligns with the technical analysis, where ETH has struggled to reclaim key resistance levels. However, a stabilization in OI could indicate that the worst of the sell-off is over, setting up conditions for a potential relief rally. Yet, for a sustainable recovery, Open Interest must start rising again alongside price, confirming fresh capital entering long positions rather than just short squeezes. Until then, further downside remains possible, especially if ETH fails to hold the $1,800 support zone.

Binance reached out to Trump‚Äôs family representatives in 2024, offering to strike a deal as part of a plan to resume Binance.US operations in the country, The Wall Street Journal reported on March 13. Citing sources familiar with the matter, the report mentioned that Binance‚Äôs billionaire founder Changpeng Zhao ‚Äî who served four months in prison in the US ‚Äî has been pushing for the Trump administration to grant him a pardon. ‚ÄúIt is unclear what form the Trump family stake would take if the deal comes together or whether it would be contingent on a pardon,‚Äù the report said. World Liberty Financial among deal options According to WSJ, a potential opportunity could be a scenario where Trump takes the stake in Binance or proceeds with the deal through World Liberty Financial , a Trump-backed crypto venture launched in September 2024. Trump has emerged as the first US ‚Äúcrypto president,‚Äù launching his Official Trump (TRUMP) memecoin days before returning to the White House on Jan. 20. A similar memecoin subsequently came from Trump‚Äôs wife, Melania , while Trump‚Äôs son, Eric Trump, has been actively pushing for Bitcoin ( BTC ) and crypto adoption. Cointelegraph approached Binance for a comment regarding the report on the alleged deal but did not receive a response by publication. Trump slams WSJ for ‚Äúpolluted thinking‚Äù of the EU Minutes before the WSJ article was published at 1:00 pm UTC, Trump took to Truth Social to slam the publication for allegedly reporting wrong information. ‚ÄúThe Globalist Wall Street Journal has no idea what they are doing or saying. They are owned by the polluted thinking of the European Union, which was formed for the primary purpose of ‚Äòscrewing‚Äô the United States of America,‚Äù the president wrote. Source: Donald Trump While Trump was fast to address the WSJ report minutes before its publication, major Trump-linked industry figures ‚Äî including Elon Musk and David Sacks ‚Äî did not react to the news on social media. Related: Donald Trump‚Äôs memecoin generated $350M for creators: Report Binance‚Äôs Zhao and CEO Richard Teng also didn‚Äôt respond to the report in the first hour of its publication. Binance CEO praises Trump as a catalyst for a ‚Äúglobal pro-crypto shift‚Äù Instead, Teng took to X on March 13 to highlight his new interview with CNBC, where he praised Trump as a catalyst for a ‚Äúglobal pro-crypto shift.‚Äù Teng expressed confidence that the crypto industry is widely supporting Trump, stating: ‚ÄúIf you ask anybody in the crypto industry, people prefer the current administration compared to the last one.‚Äù Still, some apparently have not been happy with all of Trump‚Äôs crypto policies, with many advocating for Bitcoin-only US reserves instead of a multi-crypto approach chosen by the administration.

As it is a native token for a Telegram mini-app, it quickly gained traction among investors, especially as it rewards users for engagement. The airdrop is just a few days away, so let‚Äôs discuss everything you need to know before that happens. PAWS is a popular Telegram mini-app, which also went viral among crypto investors for its point earning mechanism, where users earn points for completing simple tasks. Such mini-games are popular; many have already launched their tokens, but only a few survived. This is why the expectations are way higher for the PAWS token launch and the airdrop. PAWS Coin Airdrop 2025 Listing Date & Details PAWS is a Solana meme coin and will be launched on March 18, 2025, on various famous cryptocurrency exchanges, including Bybit and Bitget.

These projects are built on community engagement and can have several use cases like peer-to-peer payments, trading, and speculative investments. They generally have comical themes, with the project‚Äôs creators and community marketing a sense of community to sell the project. Dogecoin (DOGE), the largest and most popular stablecoin, is based on the DOGE meme. So are other projects like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Pepe (PEPE), and Dogwifhat (WIF). Lately, several new meme coins have emerged to challenge the established order. Two of the most prominent ones are Husky Inu and Floki (FLOKI). Let‚Äôs look at how the new kids on the block stack up against one another. Husky Inu (HINU) Husky Inu (HINU) is the latest member of the meme coin pack. The project was created to bring more value and utility to its users and token holders by leveraging the power of the Solana blockchain. Husky Inu aims to build a robust and supportive community, that boasts enhanced rewards and innovative features. The project‚Äôs presale has been a resounding success, with its first stage selling out in days, with subsequent stages well underway. The project has raised over $720,000 so far and is on track to meet its goal of $1.2M. Husky Inu‚Äôs presale success should come as no surprise given what the project has planned. Husky Inu plans to launch two standout features: An Earn App and a decentralized exchange. The Earn App is designed to reward users for interacting with the project and completing simple tasks like liking, reposting, and sharing content. The decentralized exchange will facilitate decentralized trading and improve the utility and value of the HINU token. Floki (FLOKI) Floki (FLOKI) is the utility token of the Floki ecosystem. The token was conceptualized and created by members of the Shiba Inu (SHIB) community, inspired by and named after Elon Musk‚Äôs Shiba Inu. A decentralized community-run project, Floki was founded by an anonymous dev who abandoned it shortly after its creation. The Shiba Inu community took over the project and made it a recognized crypto project as it reached over 400,000 holders in its first year. The Floki Community calls itself the ‚ÄúFloki Vikings‚Äù in honor of Musk‚Äôs dog, which was named after a Viking character. The project has been listed several times in the Top 10 of LunarCrush‚Äôs social engagement leaderboards. It has also partnered with leading crypto projects, including Chainlink and Trader Joes. How Does Husky Inu Work? Husky Inu has several features that set it apart from the competition. Earn App - Husky Inu‚Äôs Earn App will allow users to earn HINU tokens by interacting with the platform, watching videos and ads, and sharing posts on social media. Deflationary Supply - Husky Inu has made the HINU token deflationary. The project plans to allocate 50% of all platform fees collected from the upcoming exchange and decentralized exchange to buy back HINU tokens, reducing their supply over time. Quick Transactions - Husky Inu leverages the power of the Solana blockchain, bringing users quick transactions at a fractional cost. Charity - The project plans to allocate 5% of the token supply to charities and community rewards to support goodwill causes and user-supported charities. How Does Floki Work? Floki is working on four flagship projects. An NFT gaming metaverse, Valhalla A suite of decentralized finance (DeFi) projects launched under the Floki umbrella. An NFT and merchandise marketplace called Flokiplaces A content and education platform called the University of Floki. Join The Husky Inu Presale! You can still join the Husky Inu Presale by following the steps listed below. Connect a Wallet - Connect your wallet using the available options. If you encounter an issue, contact Husky Inu‚Äôs official Telegram channel. Select Network - You can join the HINU presale on the Solana blockchain and purchase the token using the native currency or with BTC, ETH, BNB, LTC, DOGE, TRX, DASH, BCH, or USDT on Ethereum and Tron chains. Buy The Tokens - Next, specify the amount of BTC, ETH, BNB, LTC, DOGE, TRX, DASH, BCH, or USDT you wish to trade for HINU and approve the transaction to purchase the token.

41591971,https://coingape.com/?p=243975,1741872518,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coingape.png,Breaking: Trump Family Eyes Stake In Binance US As CZ Seeks Pardon,https://coingape.com/trump-family-eyes-stake-in-binance-us-as-cz-seeks-pardon/,"Donald Trump‚Äôs family is reportedly eyeing acquiring a stake in the US arm of the crypto exchange Binance. This comes as the exchange‚Äôs founder is allegedly seeking a pardon for his guilty plea in 2023, which led to his imprisonment. Trump‚Äôs Family Eyes Stake In Binance US According to a WSJ report , US President Donald Trump‚Äôs family representatives have held talks to acquire a stake in Binance‚Äôs US arm. This comes just after the top crypto exchange announced that Abu Dhabi-based MGX had invested $2 billion in the exchange to acquire a minority stake. Meanwhile, the WSJ report also revealed that the exchange‚Äôs founder Changpeng ‚ÄúCZ‚Äù Zhao is also pushing for Trump‚Äôs administration to grant him a pardon. Last year, CZ served a four-month sentence after he and Binance US pleaded guilty to anti-money laundering violations. A pardon will wipe Zhao‚Äôs criminal record away from the registry, meaning he will no longer be regarded as an ex-convict. The Correlation Between Both Developments Both the Trump family‚Äôs move to acquire a stake in Binance US and CZ‚Äôs push for a pardon could intertwine, especially considering that the exchange‚Äôs founder is allegedly still the largest shareholder. As such, he could play a major role in Trump‚Äôs move to acquire a stake in the top crypto exchange‚Äôs US arm. WSJ also revealed that the talks to acquire a stake in the crypto exchange began after Binance reached out to Trump‚Äôs allies in 2024 offering to strike a deal with the family as part of its strategy to revive the exchange‚Äôs US arm. It is worth mentioning that the US arm resumed its USD services after Trump took office in January. According to WSJ, it is still unclear what form the Trump family stake would look like if the deal happens or even whether it would depend on Trump granting CZ a pardon. Meanwhile, the report noted that there is also the possibility of the deal going through World Liberty Financial, which the Trump family has ties with.

41592085,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=692261,1741872525,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/41592085.jpeg,"US core PPI falls to 3.4%, lower than expectations",https://www.cryptopolitan.com/us-core-ppi-falls-to-3-4/,"The Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) reported on Thursday that producer prices in the United States remained flat in February, missing forecasts and signaling that inflation may be cooling. The producer price index (PPI), which tracks what producers get for their goods and services, showed no increase for the month, following January‚Äôs upwardly revised 0.6% gain. Economists had expected a 0.3% increase, but actual numbers came in lower. Core PPI, which excludes food and energy, fell 0.1%, marking the first decline since July. Analysts had forecasted a 0.3% rise, making this a major miss. Core prices that also exclude trade services managed a 0.2% gain. The report follows the consumer price index (CPI) data released the day before, which showed a 0.2% increase for February, bringing the annual inflation rate to 2.8%, slightly lower than January‚Äôs figures. Stock market futures react while Treasury yields stay elevated Stock market futures responded immediately. S&P 500 futures trimmed losses after the report, while Dow Jones Industrial Average futures still showed a 71-point drop (0.2%). Nasdaq 100 futures declined 0.4%, reversing some of the previous day‚Äôs gains. The reaction was mixed as traders tried to assess what the latest inflation data meant for Federal Reserve policy. Treasury yields stayed elevated as investors maintained expectations that the Fed will keep rates steady at its next meeting on Wednesday. The market is already pricing in near 100% odds that rates won‚Äôt change. Policymakers have emphasized a cautious approach as they monitor inflation trends and potential economic risks tied to Donald Trump‚Äôs trade policies. Trump shook markets earlier Thursday when he announced plans to impose 200% tariffs on European alcoholic imports in retaliation for the EU‚Äôs 50% tariff on American whisky. ‚ÄúThis will be great for the wine and champagne businesses in the U.S.,‚Äù he posted on Truth Social, triggering fresh concerns about a worsening trade war. The announcement weighed on market sentiment, sending futures lower before the PPI report helped ease concerns. Fed rate cut expectations remain despite weaker inflation data The Federal Reserve has been closely monitoring inflation as it weighs potential rate cuts during the fourth quarter of this year. February‚Äôs PPI report showed that headline producer prices were up by 3.2% year over year, and down from by 3.7% in January. The core PPI was at 3.4%, after dropping by 0.4 percentage points from the month before. Despite signs of cooling inflation, markets still expect the Fed to begin cutting rates as early as June. Barclays, for one, expects at least two more quarter-point reductions before the year‚Äôs over. Some policymakers, however, are concerned about how Trump‚Äôs fiscal and trade policies will affect economic growth and inflation in the months ahead. Within the PPI report, a 0.2% drop in services prices offset a 0.3% rise in goods prices. The BLS noted that two-thirds of the increase in goods came from a staggering 53.6% surge in chicken egg prices. The egg market has been hit hard by avian flu, which has tightened supply, though reports indicate that prices have started to stabilize in March. On the services side, over 40% of the decline came from a 1.4% drop in margins for machinery and vehicle wholesaling. This reflects slowing demand in key industrial sectors, as businesses and consumers pull back on spending. Investors have remained cautious despite the cooling inflation data. The Nasdaq saw a sharp reversal after a 1.2% gain on Wednesday, fueled by strong performances from Nvidia and Palantir Technologies. However, the broader markets continued to struggle. The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed 0.2% lower on Wednesday, marking its third straight losing session. The S&P 500, despite a 0.5% increase Wednesday, is still heading for a rough week. So far, the S&P 500 and Nasdaq are both down 3% for the week, while the Dow has dropped 3.4%, its worst week since March 2023. The S&P 500 actually entered correction territory for a second there earlier this week, falling by 10% from its February all-time high. But as Cryptopolitan reported on Wednesday, Trump has dismissed the stock market as a ‚Äúfake economy.‚Äù He no longer sees it as a measure of his economic victory, like he did during his first term in office.

The stake could have been acquired through Trump-family backed crypto project World Liberty Financial, the report said, citing people familiar with the matter. Steve Witkoff, a friend of the U.S. president, was involved in the deal talks, the report added. Witkoff and his family founded World Liberty Financial two months before Trump was elected President in November. The talks started last year after Binance reached out to Trump's allies offering to reach a deal with the family so as to bring the crypto exchange back to the U.S. BNB , the native cryptocurrency of the Binance linked BNB Chain, jumped as much as 5% on the news, surpassing $600 for the first time in a week. A representative for Binance.US declined to comment on the report. The exchange just recently saw its U.S. dollar fiat services restored after it lost the ability to deposit and withdraw USD under the Biden Administration. Former Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) Chair Gary Gensler had previously branded Binance.US ""a cauldron of fraud"" and tried everything in his power to crack down on the exchange. As a result, the company lost thousands of customers and was forced to lay off 70% of its staff after losing billions of dollars. Binance also took its i nstitutional investment on Wednesday as Abu-Dhabi based investment firm MGX put $2 billion in the exchange.

US President Donald Trump threatened to double his tariffs on steel and aluminum from 25% to 50%, leading the government of the province of Ontario to walk back its own plan to increase the cost of power exports to the US. Ontario Premier Doug Ford had promised to further increase the surcharge or even ‚Äúshut off the electricity completely,‚Äù given further provocation. However, he appears to have softened his stance, at least for now. The trade war may have reached a lull, but some crypto firms are looking ahead at possible policy changes in order to protect their growth. Bitcoin miners expect changes in energy markets Ben Ganon, the CEO of Canadian Bitcoin mining firm Bitfarms, told Bloomberg on March 11 that the recent energy price hikes, had they gone through, were unlikely to affect his firm‚Äôs business. Bitfarms‚Äô operations are mostly in Quebec and British Columbia, both of which boast significant hydroelectric capacity in relation to the total provincial energy mix. Ontario, by comparison, is ‚Äúnot as robust of an energy market. And over the last several years, they‚Äôve really taken a big push on cutting back on baseload capacity.‚Äù But even though Bitfarms‚Äô energy situation may look solid for the time being, Ganon said that the tariffs ‚Äúhave implications for what policy and regulatory frameworks are going to look like in the future.‚Äù He said that his firm wants to see ‚Äúgreater access to electricity markets‚Äù as well as fewer regulations on setting up a new business or new power applications. Energy policy has been a contentious area of debate in Canadian politics, with critics accusing the Liberal government ‚Äî now led by Prime Minister Mark Carney ‚Äî of harming the Canadian economy with their strategies to lower emissions. Related: What Canada‚Äôs new Liberal PM Mark Carney means for crypto Ganon said: ‚ÄúThe opportunities that are present in the United States are also present in Canada. And I think that this will all resolve itself and end up in a much more deregulated and smooth and efficient market because for years it‚Äôs been tied up in regulatory red tape.‚Äù How would a Bitcoin miner benefit from tariffs? Tariffs on goods such as steel, aluminum, and other industrial products ‚Äî intended to encourage domestic production in the US‚Äî also impact Bitcoin miners, with some effects being unexpectedly beneficial. While Ganon noted that miners can‚Äôt control the Bitcoin price, they can control their electricity costs. ‚ÄúOne of the ways that we can do that is we can look for pockets of energy that are underutilized, that used to power heavy industry, which has been outsourced to other countries over the last 20 or 30 years.‚Äù According to Ganon, Bitfarms has operations in Pennsylvania ‚Äî a ‚ÄúRust Belt‚Äù state heavily affected by the outsourcing of American steel and metals industries. His firm‚Äôs assets could soon be in high demand if the US manufacturing industry were to come back from the dead. Ganon said that Bitcoin miners have been investing heavily in energy infrastructure that ‚Äúused to power aluminum smelters and steel refineries and all the stuff which was outsourced.‚Äù ‚ÄúNow Bitcoin miners have these assets. And as the pendulum swings back to America, those assets are now in high demand.‚Äù China tariffs squeeze Bitcoin mining hardware Canadian miners like Bitfarms may be unconcerned for now, but Trump‚Äôs tariffs on China have already begun to squeeze American crypto miners, who import hardware from China-based firms like Bitmain. According to Bloomberg, shipments of Bitcoin mining hardware from China to the US were experiencing significant delays as of February 2025. The delays reportedly were the result of the US blacklisting Bitmain‚Äôs AI affiliate Xiamen Sophgo Technologies. Heavy customs fees for inspections of Bitmain-affiliated hardware have cost US miners up to $500,000, according to Vishnu Mackenchery, director of global logistics and services at Compass Mining Inc. New tariffs could make new imports of next-gen miners to the US ‚Äúcompletely cost-prohibitive,‚Äù according to Synteq Digital CEO Taras Kulyk. China-based mining hardware producers like Bitmain could set up operations in other countries to avoid US sanctions. During Trump‚Äôs first term, when he imposed a 25% tax duty on a number of consumer electronic goods from China, many mining hardware producers moved to Malaysia, Indonesia and Thailand to avoid tariffs. Bitmain even announced it would launch a US production line in December 2024 to ‚Äúprovide faster response times and more efficient services to the North American customers.‚Äù Bloomberg noted that the firm did not provide the exact location of its US line. Related: Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent says US should bring BTC onshore Trump‚Äôs economic policies continue to be a mixed bag for the crypto industry. Wild fluctuations in trade policy and last-minute reversals have made the market difficult to predict. Elsewhere, the European Union has promised to impose counter-tariffs on the US, further threatening asset valuations. Bitcoin price chart Sept. 1, 2024 to March 13, 2025.

In a recent interview with Bloomberg, Tenev spoke deeply about his vision for a market with regulatory shifts, a pro-crypto US president, and what AI means for the future of stock markets. On US President Donald Trump‚Äôs impact on the market, Tenev believes the current administration could create a playing field where both AI and crypto can co-exist and flourish. He expects the government to adopt more clear regulations and work closely with the private sector to ensure the US leads in most of the industries. ‚Äú They‚Äôve got smart people thinking through these problems ,‚Äù he said, reiterating that reduced bureaucracy and clearer rules could encourage more businesses to innovate and expand. Do crypto and stocks need a merged market? Some analysts may view crypto as a separate asset class, but 38-year-old Tenev sees it more like a technological tweak that compliments the traditional financial markets. ‚Äú I like to think about crypto less as a distinct, tradable asset and more as a new technology, so, along the chain of filing cabinet and pen and paper, to mainframes. If you‚Äôve got a tradable token on all blockchains, and it‚Äôs liquid, that‚Äôs essentially an IPO ,‚Äù he explained. Under the Bulgarian-American businessman‚Äôs direction, Robinhood jumped into prediction markets, and it now allows users to bet on events like elections just like the decentralized betting marketplace Polymarket . Still, Tenev insists his platform‚Äôs market is not necessarily gambling because the odds are not ‚Äúset by the house‚Äù but rather governed by a regulated exchange. ‚Äú What that allows is better price discovery. Just like how we‚Äôre looking at stock markets today and making assessments for which way the tariffs are going to go, what the impact is going to be on the economy, ‚Äù he expounded. AI is now part of the financial industry In 2023, Tenev collaborated with programmer Tudor Achim to create Harmonic, an AI startup focused on mathematical superintelligence . According to the two co-founders, Harmonic‚Äôs large language model (LLM) is ‚Äúcapable of advanced mathematical reasoning and problem-solving.‚Äù The Robinhood CEO claims that advancements in AI-driven math could add to the betterment of fields like physics, biology, and chemistry, and create ‚Äúbreakthroughs‚Äù in energy generation and longevity. ‚Äú If you become superhuman at math, you essentially become superhuman across any quantitative science domain, and then you start making serious progress on problems like energy generation, longevity, and fundamental physics .‚Äù Concluding the interview, Tenev reckoned that in financial markets, AI has done more to make its presence impossible to ignore. ‚Äú A lot of the AI investment interest is concentrated on Nvidia. It‚Äôs become the No.‚Äâ1-held stock on Robinhood, surpassing Tesla, which is another AI stock in its own right . If control over the technology is going to be centralized in the companies, then you have to be an investor .‚Äù Robinhood‚Äôs crypto activity follows the market decline trend In other developments, Robinhood‚Äôs shares surged about 7% in pre-market trading on Thursday and have climbed 130.57% over the past year. The price uptick comes after Deutsche Bank recently called the stock‚Äôs recent selloff a ‚Äúgood buying opportunity,‚Äù backing its claims over the platform‚Äôs trading volumes in equities, options, and increased customer deposits. Yet, the current crypto market slump has taken a toll on its trading volumes. According to a press release published on Tuesday, Robinhood recorded $14.4 billion in crypto transactions in February alone, a 29% drop from the previous month. In contrast, equities and options trading saw only marginal declines of 1%. Still, the company‚Äôs crypto trading volume has doubled its level from the previous year. Robinhood‚Äôs overall assets under custody (AUC) stood at $187 billion at the end of last month, an 8% dip from January but a 58% increase year-over-year. Net deposits reached $4.8 billion for the period, which represents an annualized growth rate of 28%. Cryptopolitan Academy: Tired of market swings?

At the same time, Changpeng ‚ÄúCZ‚Äù Zhao, the founder of Binance, is actively seeking a pardon from President Trump following his imprisonment for regulatory infractions, the report added. Trump Takes a Bold Move for Binance Since returning to the White House, President Donald Trump has been actively influencing the cryptocurrency market. In a surprising turn, the Trump family is now reportedly discussing acquiring a stake in Binance US. According to the Wall Street Journal, these talks involve buying into the American branch of the cryptocurrency exchange. The conversation started when Binance sought connections with Trump‚Äôs allies last year, aiming to reintegrate into the US market through a business partnership with the Trumps. The family could potentially hold this stake either directly or through World Liberty Financial, their crypto venture established in September. This deal would link the Trumps with a company that confessed to breaking anti-money laundering laws in 2023. Binance, having settled these violations by paying fines totaling $4.3 billion in 2023, views obtaining a pardon for its founder, Zhao, as essential for re-entering the US market.

These negotiations come as Binance founder Changpeng Zhao, known as CZ, seeks a presidential pardon following his guilty plea in 2023 for violating anti-money-laundering laws, according to The Wall Street Journal. The talks reportedly began after Binance reached out to Trump‚Äôs allies last year, looking to reestablish a presence in the U.S. market. The potential deal could involve the Trump family directly or be conducted through World Liberty Financial , a Trump-backed cryptocurrency venture launched in September. However, it remains unclear whether the stake would be contingent on a pardon for Zhao. Steve Witkoff, a close Trump associate and the administration‚Äôs top negotiator for the Middle East and Ukraine conflicts, has played a role in these discussions, sources say told WSJ . You might also like: EXCLUSIVE: Copper and Figment partner to expand institutional staking Binance‚Äôs legal and business challenges Binance has faced intense regulatory scrutiny in the U.S., culminating in a $4.3 billion settlement with authorities in 2023 over alleged facilitation of illicit transactions. As part of the agreement, Zhao stepped down as CEO and served four months in prison but remains Binance‚Äôs majority shareholder. In recent months, Binance has been positioning itself for a return to the U.S. market. The exchange set up an internal working group under CEO Richard Teng to explore legal pathways, acknowledging that Zhao‚Äôs criminal conviction could hinder its reintegration. Trump‚Äôs pro-crypto stance has added momentum to Binance‚Äôs efforts. His administration has been rolling back regulatory restrictions on the industry, signing executive orders that benefit digital asset firms. The potential Trump-Binance deal raises concerns about conflicts of interest, as it would mark an unprecedented overlap between the presidency and private business dealings. Unlike past presidents, Trump has maintained control over his assets through his family, allowing them to pursue business ventures while he remains in office. Separately, Binance executives have reportedly studied the case of Justin Sun , a crypto entrepreneur facing SEC charges, who invested $30 million in Trump‚Äôs World Liberty Financial last year. Following Sun‚Äôs investment, the SEC paused its fraud case against him, leading Binance to consider a similar strategy, sources told the WSJ .

You attempt to send money to a friend for a political donation, but the transaction is blocked because the recipient is on a government ‚Äúwatch list.‚Äù You buy a book critical of a powerful politician and your account is flagged for review. This dystopian future sounds outrageous but it‚Äôs the logical endpoint of a fully government-controlled and monitored monetary system for which some prominent U.S. policymakers advocate. Its defenders argue that such a government-omniscient system would prevent crime. In reality, it would destroy the core freedoms of financial privacy and autonomy. Stablecoins are an existing alternative to this dystopia. They are both a major financial innovation, and a bulwark against creeping financial authoritarianism. The U.S. Congress must support this technology as the Senate Banking Committee weighs legislation to provide clarity for the industry and its customers. Stablecoins, digital currencies pegged to the value of traditional currencies like the U.S. dollar, provide the benefits of cryptocurrency ‚Äî fast, inexpensive, borderless, and programmable transactions ‚Äî without the price volatility of assets like Bitcoin. They are typically backed 1:1 with U.S. dollar cash and cash equivalents, providing stability and trust. Their programmability allows transactions to be executed automatically when specified conditions are met, unlocking enormous potential for automated finance, supply chain efficiency, and global commerce. Senators across the U.S. political spectrum, who understand the technology‚Äôs current use cases and the vast future possibilities we can‚Äôt yet fully envision, have proposed thoughtful legislation to guide regulations that will foster innovation while protecting consumers. This collaborative approach reflects an understanding that stablecoins could revolutionize global finance, enhance financial inclusion, and preserve the U.S. dollar‚Äôs dominance in the digital age. Unfortunately, some senators, especially Senator Elizabeth Warren (D-MA), stand in stark opposition to this progress. Rather than embracing innovation, she pursues legislation that would smother stablecoins in their infancy. Senator Warren paints stablecoins as tools for illicit activity, claiming they primarily facilitate fraud, drug trafficking, and terrorist financing. Her characterization is not just inaccurate ‚Äî it‚Äôs dangerously misleading. The data directly contradicts Senator Warren‚Äôs claims. Multiple reports from blockchain analytics firms consistently show that illicit activity represents a tiny fraction of stablecoin transactions ‚Äî often less than 1% of total volume. In fact, traditional cash is far more frequently used for money laundering and illicit trade than stablecoins ever have been. Blockchain technology, with its permanent and transparent ledger, actually makes illegal activity easier to track and prosecute than cash-based crime. Senator Warren‚Äôs misinformed worldview leads her to advocate for a closed, government-monitored financial system ‚Äî one in which every transaction is scrutinized, private financial activity becomes impossible, and access to financial tools is tightly controlled. In addition to being a morally objectionable invasion of privacy, her design would be operationally impossible to implement. It would also weaken the dollar‚Äôs global dominance, as emerging economies and developing nations would turn to other digital currencies that are easier to access and use. Her constraints could not only impede the development of an important new technology, but also disrupt and harm ordinary Americans and businesses, and people around the world, who are using stablecoins today to move value across the internet as easily as sending an email or text message, often at a fraction of traditional costs. For example: Major American corporations like Visa and PayPal are using stablecoins to settle some cross-border payments, reducing settlement times from days to minutes and lowering costs. By making dollars the default currency of the digital economy, stablecoins reinforce the dollar‚Äôs role as the global reserve currency. Increased global demand for dollar-denominated stablecoins increases demand for U.S. dollars and treasury securities, helping finance government borrowing at lower rates. In countries suffering from high inflation or capital controls, stablecoins provide ordinary citizens with a safe, dollar-denominated savings option, protecting their wealth from economic mismanagement. Migrant workers sending money home can do so more quickly, inexpensively, and more reliably with stablecoins than through traditional remittance services, which often charge exorbitant fees. The Warren vision rejects the open, public, universally accessible system being developed today ‚Äî a system where individuals and businesses alike can transact freely, without needing permission from banks or governments. Fortunately, there is still hope for a balanced regulatory approach. Senators Bill Hagerty (R-TN), Kirsten Gillibrand (D-NY), Cynthia Lummis (R-WY), and Tim Scott (R-SC) have introduced the bi-partisan GENIUS Act which would create a constructive regulatory framework for stablecoins that addresses legitimate concerns while enabling innovation. The GENIUS Act, and the White House Executive Order on Strengthening American Leadership in Digital Financial Technology, will both ensure that the benefits of blockchain technology can be fully realized on open, freely accessible and transparent public blockchains. Congress must embrace stablecoins, not fear them. The future of money is being written today. Will the United States lead this transformation, ensuring that digital dollars remain the global standard? Or will fear, misinformation, and stifling regulation hand the future of finance to other nations? The choice is clear: support innovation, enact smart regulation, and let stablecoins flourish.",Opinion,EN,0,0,REGULATION|TECHNOLOGY|BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|BUSINESS,"{'name': 'CoinDesk', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coindesk.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coindesk,2025-03-13 13:46:52

JPMorgan raised IREN (IREN), its top pick in the sector, to overweight from neutral, and cut its price target to $12 from $15. The shares were 2.7% higher at $7.23 in early trade. Cipher Mining (CIFR) was downgraded to neutral from overweight, while the bank withdrew its $8 price target. The stock fell 3% to $3.10. The bank reiterated its overweight ratings on Riot Platforms (RIOT) and CleanSpark (CLSK), and reduced their respective price targets to $13 and $12. Riot slipped 0.5% to $7.82. CleanSpark gained 0.6% to $8.15. It reiterated its neutral rating on MARA Holdings (MARA), and cut the company's price target to $18 from $23. The shares rose 0.5% to $13.14. Miner's price targets were slashed by 19%-29% to reflect a 10% reduction to the bank's bitcoin price assumption and an 80% increase to the bank's network hashrate growth estimate. The total market cap of the five mining stocks that the bank covers has slumped more than 20% year-to-date versus a 11% decline in the bitcoin price, the report noted. Mining stocks have come under pressure as high performance computing (HPC) deals have taken longer than expected to come to fruition, and mining economics have deteriorated, the bank said.

Following the CPI data, expectations about the possibility of the FED cutting interest rates were reshaped, and Barclays revised its estimate. FED Will Cut Interest Rates Two Times, Then Start Again in March 2026! Barclays raised its 2025 Fed rate cut expectation from one to two, citing softer labor market conditions despite tariff uncertainty, Reuters reported. Barclays analysts said they expect the FED to cut interest rates twice in 2025, by 25 points each in June and September. The bank had previously projected a 25 basis point cut in June. ‚ÄúWeaker labor market forces us to make another rate cut despite higher inflation.‚Äù Barclays analysts added that after the latest rate cut in September this year, the Fed will take a long break from rate cuts and expect it to restart the rate cut cycle in March 2026. No Interest Rate Cut This Year! While Barclays doubled its 2025 interest rate cut expectation following the inflation data announced yesterday, the data did not impress Nomura economists. Accordingly, Nomura economists think that the Fed will not cut interest rates this year. Despite the data coming in below expectations yesterday, Nomura analysts said that the components of the consumer price index (CPI), which have a higher weight in core personal consumption expenditures (PCE) inflation, came in stronger than they expected. Economists said they expect the upward trend in PCE to continue, adding that this would lead the Fed to take a more hawkish stance in monetary policy and not cut interest rates. When is the FED Meeting? The FED will announce its March interest rate decision on Wednesday, March 19. The expectation is that interest rates will remain constant. *This is not investment advice.

Recent data from IntoTheBlock shows that most of the people who invested in tokens such as Toncoin (TON), Aerodrome Finance (AERO), and Optimism (OP) are deep in the red, with some losses nearing 100%. However, the grim numbers notwithstanding, on-chain data suggests that some of these assets still have strong fundamentals, suggesting that they could be potentially undervalued. The Painful Reality for Altcoin Holders According to IntoTheBlock‚Äôs analysis , a staggering 96% of TON holders are losing money. Similarly, 97% of AERO and 98% of OP investors are underwater. Even popular tokens like Polygon (MATIC) and Worldcoin (WLD) haven‚Äôt been spared, with just 1% of their holders seeing any returns on their investment. However, in a pretty bad market, the worst hit seems to be Axie Infinity (AXS), with 100% of those owning the token losing substantial portions of their capital. The broader crypto market isn‚Äôt helping either. Bitcoin‚Äôs dominance has jumped to a four-year high , leaving altcoins in the dust. Additionally, Ethereum (ETH), the second-largest digital asset by market capitalization, has sunk to bear market lows, dragging the rest of the ecosystem down with it. However, none of these are lost, as some tokens have shown resilience in usage metrics. IntoTheBlock highlighted Toncoin, for instance, which, despite a dip in active addresses, is still above last year‚Äôs levels when it started its impressive rally. AERO has also seen active addresses cut in half since its ‚ÄúBase season‚Äù peak. Nonetheless, its transaction volume remains steady, which analysts say is an indicator of continued engagement within the network despite fewer users. The situation is almost the same on Optimism, with user activity at its lowest level since 2023, but transactions have remained high. Market Woes These struggles are reflected in the tokens‚Äô price actions, where, for example, TON dropped 9.2% over the past week, while AERO sank 16.8%. Priced at $0.2188 at the time of writing, MATIC has barely moved in the last 24 hours, with a miserly 0.6% gain in that time. Year-on-year, all of the tokens on IntoTheBlock‚Äôs list are in the red, with WLD the biggest culprit, having shed almost 92% of its value and even hitting a new all-time low just two days ago. The market conditions responsible for these losses are puzzling observers. Despite bullish catalysts like an executive order establishing a strategic BTC reserve and new ETF filings, macro factors, including a Donald Trump-triggered trade war and recession fears, are suppressing prices.

On Thursday, 5TARS.io , a Web3 sports gaming platform offering fantasy games, collections and prediction markets, announced its move from the SKALE EVEM chain to Concordium Layer 1 blockchain , which is designed for security, privacy, and scalability. The announcement confirmed that the migration of the 5TARS.io platform will take place in the coming weeks, with the completion date set for late March 2025. The migration will see popular 5TARS.io titles such as the 5TARS Football game ported to Concordium and new releases such as the cricket game for India, planned to release later this year also ported to the new blockchain. All future releases, NFTs and collections will also be hosted on the Layer 1 chain. ‚ÄúMigrating to Concordium will provide us with a permanent home where we can launch innovative games that will delight and entertain our global gaming community,‚Äù Borja Burguillos, Founder & CEO of 5TARS.io, commented on the migration to Concordium. The popular 5TARS Football game, which includes prediction matches, marketplace for collection cards, Arenas, superpicks and other mini-games, will also be ported to Concordium. This is expected to bring a huge number of users to the Layer 1 chain, with the popular game boasting over 250,000 registered users and 20,000 monthly active users. Notwithstanding, more than 1,720,000 arenas have been joined by 5TARS Football players, who have also traded 45,000 NFTs. The popularity extends to social media platforms, with 5TARS.io‚Äôs community exceeding 200,000 across X, Telegram, and Discord. The 5TARS Football game saw peak activity during Euro 2024, attracting 45,000 active players. A New Scalable Future For 5TARS.io Fandom Once the migration is complete, 5TARS.io players will enjoy several benefits in addition to the scalability that Concordium offers. The sports gaming platform will be enhanced with powerful features such as age verification and geo-fencing, allowing players from different regions to compete. The team also announced the launch of new games to the blockchain, including a cricket game for India, scheduled for Q3, as well as the existing Starzplay MENA cricket game, which debuted on Concordium last month. According to Burguillos, Concordium offered the best option for 5TARS.io due to its key features in gaming, gambling and online betting. First, Concordium‚Äôs infrastructure is optimized for high throughput and performance. Additionally, the blockchain supports privacy-focused identity verification and geo-fencing enabled via zero knowledge proofs, which are critical for the gaming, gambling and online betting industries for compliance and geographical expansion. ‚ÄúThe ability to tap into ready-made solutions for privacy and compliance, coupled with the scalability that Concordium provides, will enhance our existing releases and push the boundaries of what can be created within web3 gaming,‚Äù he added. Notwithstanding, the migration to Concordium also helps facilitate 5TARS.io‚Äôs strategic expansion across multiple regions, including the challenges that pertain to scalability, performance, age verification, geo-fencing, and compliance. As Mike Milner, Chief Commercial Officer of Concordium, shared welcoming the platform to his blockchain: ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre pleased to support 5TARS.io as they embark on the next leg of their journey by providing them with the infrastructure and tooling to create best-in-class web3 games that will unlock new opportunities for player ownership and fan engagement.‚Äù With a goal to transform sports gaming and how fans interact with the sports they love, the move to Concordium will help 5TARS.io reach global audiences. The platform will enhance how fans control their digital assets, such as NFTs and in-game currency, as it prepares for the launch of new titles powered by play-compete-earn mechanics.

Having begun life as a simple platform for creating an online marketplace, Shopify has evolved into a comprehensive ecosystem that enables businesses of all sizes to thrive in the digital age. Its arrival was a pivotal moment in the rise of the Web2 era , providing a foundation for the entire global economy to shift to online sales. Now, as the nascent Web3 movement starts gaining traction, many are asking when it will have its own ‚ÄúShopify‚Äù moment. Igniting Web2‚Äôs E-Commerce Revolution Before Shopify burst onto the scene in the late 2000s, getting an online store up and running was a major headache for most businesses, especially smaller ones with only a few members of staff. There was no easy way to go about it, with entrepreneurs forced to seek out a suitable website developer and design and build their own, customized shopping platform from scratch. Building an online store is much more difficult than cobbling together a website. There‚Äôs the need to integrate different payment methods, create an online shopping cart, build product search and recommendation systems, and implement strong security measures - the whole caboodle made it an extremely complex endeavor that would cost thousands of dollars and take months to put together. Then Shopify arrived on the scene, ushering in nothing short of a revolution in online shopping . With its user-friendly interface, pre-built templates, plug-and-play integrations, intuitive drag-and-drop design tools and various other components, plus an extensive ecosystem of third-party apps, it dramatically lowered the barrier for e-commerce development. Shopify makes it possible for even the smallest business to get a slick, highly professional digital storefront on the internet in a matter of hours, simplifying the development process to such an extent that you don‚Äôt need a developer at all. Shopify provides an all-in-one solution that covers every aspect of selling online, from storefront design and management to processing payments and order fulfilment. With its robust backend infrastructure, it takes care of every important detail, securing customer data and payments, managing product inventories and the logistics of shipping. Web3‚Äôs User Experience Is a Deal Breaker Shopify is credited with playing a critical role in the growth of Web2, which marked the evolution of the internet from a static platform for consuming information into the interactive digital world almost everyone is reliant on today. Now, as Web3 emerges from Web2‚Äôs shadow, it‚Äôs awaiting its own ‚ÄúShopify moment‚Äù to help kick start mainstream adoption. Web3 is the idea of a new kind of decentralized Internet that‚Äôs built on blockchain technology and integrates token-based economics. It promises to eliminate intermediaries and centralization, allowing users to own their data and interact directly with their peers without censorship and participate in governance of their favorite services. There has been a lot of interest in Web3, and already it has millions of advocates globally, but that‚Äôs not enough to drive the next revolution. The biggest obstacle facing Web3 is its user experience. Interacting with blockchains requires a lot of technical knowledge, with users required to create wallets and manage and secure seed phrases and understand concepts such as gas fees and decentralized identities. There are some major security issues that need to be dealt with, too. If Web3 is to achieve mass adoption, it needs to be as simple and as accessible as the Web2 platforms and systems we use today, while retaining the immutability, decentralization and cost-effectiveness that makes it superior. What‚Äôs needed is a kind of Web3 version of Shopify, a platform that streamlines the process of building and interacting with decentralized applications, so everyone can get to grips with them. Is This Blockchain The Next Shopify? The question now is who will be the first to ‚ÄúShopify‚Äù the Web3 experience, and there is one standout contender in the shape of XION , which is a new ‚Äúwalletless‚Äù Layer-1 network that aims to abstract away all of the technical hassles of blockchain and create Web2-like experiences for decentralized applications. XION‚Äôs mission is to completely eliminate the steep learning curve of Web3 today and streamline interactions with Web3 protocols, making them as simple to use as today‚Äôs Web2 applications and services. By improving the user experience in this way, it hopes that everyone will be able to access the benefits of decentralized ecosystems without even realizing that they‚Äôre interacting with a blockchain. In addition, XION also solves other major obstacles in the way of Web3‚Äôs progress, such as the fragmentation of liquidity and ecosystems that has resulted from having so many different Layer-1 and Layer-2 blockchains. Through its chain abstraction capabilities, XION makes it simple for users to get started in Web3, starting with one of the biggest problems of all. It allows users to buy and use crypto without creating a digital wallet and storing the seed phrase. It takes care of the fiat on- and off-ramps and other necessary features, like bridging funds to the correct network, swapping tokens to ensure the user has the cryptocurrency they need, and making sure they always have enough funds to pay for their gas fees. The Awesomeness of Abstraction One of XION‚Äôs key features is its Meta Accounts, which rely on abstraction techniques so users can interact with their online accounts as they would with any Web2 service. This means simplified access, with email-based sign ups and password recovery, removing the need to manage private keys while still maintaining self-custody. It also abstracts away the gas payments, so users don‚Äôt have to worry about buying the right tokens to pay network fees when using any cryptocurrency. The real game-changer for XION though is that it extends its blockchain abstraction to all other networks through its cross-chain communication technology to handle interoperability. In this way, it ensures a seamless user experience no matter what chain someone is using. It‚Äôs because of these capabilities that XION has been likened to Shopify, as it allows businesses and individuals to dive right into Web3 without any technical expertise, just as the latter platform made it simple for anyone to engage in e-commerce. XION has made some encouraging progress that suggests it could yet become Web3‚Äôs Shopify, with more than 3.6 million users signed up to its network and more than 200 deployments, partnerships and integrations. It has also raised some serious cash, totaling $36 million over multiple funding rounds. Most recently, XION achieved a significant milestone when it became the first Layer-1 blockchain on mainnet to secure a Markets in Crypto-Assets or MiCA license, making it fully compliant with the EU‚Äôs crypto regulations. Anthony Anzalone, XION Founder, also took to the floor of the New York Stock Exchange today to discuss how MiCA compliance will pave the way for its institutional partners to avoid regulatory hurdles and expand their Web3 presence within the EU. Web3 for the Masses Just as Shopify helped to accelerate the Web2 revolution by bringing e-commerce to the masses, XION aims to ignite mass adoption of Web3 by making it easy for anyone to play along with. While other blockchains focus on performance, efficiency and scale, they do little to ease the main headaches preventing the industry from taking the next step forward. By tackling major obstacles to adoption, such as private key management, wallet creation and gas fees to name a few, XION is taming Web3‚Äôs user experience to such an extent that everyone can reap its benefits.

Blockchain security firms and industry experts have identified new tactics used by the notorious Lazarus Group, including laundering stolen assets through crypto mixers and deploying malware disguised as software updates. At the same time, multiple crypto founders have reported being targeted by phishing scams involving fake Zoom calls designed to install malware on their devices. North Korean Lazarus Group Moves Stolen Crypto Using Mixers Amid Fresh Malware Threats The notorious North Korean-affiliated hacking collective, the Lazarus Group, has once again made headlines for its illicit activities in the cryptocurrency space. The group, known for orchestrating high-profile cyber heists, has recently been observed laundering stolen digital assets through crypto mixers, further complicating efforts by authorities and blockchain analysts to track and recover funds. On March 13, blockchain security firm CertiK reported that it had detected a suspicious deposit of 400 ETH, valued at approximately $750,000, into Tornado Cash, a well-known cryptocurrency mixing service. The transaction was flagged as originating from the Lazarus Group‚Äôs activity on the Bitcoin network, reinforcing concerns about the organization‚Äôs continued use of obfuscation tactics to cover its tracks. Tornado Cash has been a focal point of controversy in the crypto industry due to its role in enabling anonymous transactions. The platform allows users to deposit and withdraw funds in a manner that severs the transaction history, making it difficult for authorities and blockchain forensic firms to trace illicit funds. The Lazarus Group has been behind some of the most devastating cyberattacks in the crypto sector. In February 2024, the group carried out a massive breach on the Bybit exchange, stealing an estimated $1.4 billion worth of crypto assets. This was followed by an attack on the Phemex exchange in January, which resulted in the theft of $29 million. Beyond exchange hacks, Lazarus has a history of targeting blockchain networks and DeFi platforms. One of the group‚Äôs most infamous exploits was the $600 million Ronin network hack in 2022, which remains one of the largest cryptocurrency thefts in history. According to blockchain analytics firm Chainalysis , North Korean hackers stole over $1.3 billion worth of cryptocurrency in 47 separate incidents in 2024 alone. This figure more than doubles the total amount stolen in 2023, demonstrating the group‚Äôs increasing sophistication and aggressive expansion of its cyber warfare tactics. In addition to its financial exploits, the Lazarus Group has been found deploying new forms of malware to infiltrate developer environments and steal sensitive data. Cybersecurity researchers at Socket recently uncovered six new malicious packages designed to compromise software development tools and gain access to crypto wallets. These attacks specifically target the Node Package Manager (NPM) ecosystem, which is widely used by developers to integrate JavaScript libraries into their applications. Researchers found a strain of malware named ‚ÄùBeaverTail,‚Äù embedded within seemingly legitimate libraries that Lazarus has weaponized using typosquatting techniques‚Äîcreating packages with names similar to trusted repositories in an attempt to trick developers into downloading them. Once installed, these malicious packages execute a range of functions, including: Extracting cryptocurrency wallet credentials Installing backdoors for remote access Harvesting sensitive browser data from Google Chrome, Brave, and Firefox Targeting keychain data on macOS systems The malware has been specifically designed to steal funds from Solana and Exodus wallets, two widely used crypto storage solutions. By compromising development environments, Lazarus can potentially access a range of applications, allowing them to escalate their attacks and compromise broader systems. Lazarus Group's Evolving Tactics Lazarus continues to refine its methods to evade detection. Its shift toward laundering funds through mixers like Tornado Cash shows its adaptability, while the expansion of its malware campaigns into software development ecosystems shows an alarming evolution in its strategy. Authorities worldwide are intensifying efforts to counter Lazarus and other state-sponsored hacking groups, but the decentralized and pseudonymous nature of blockchain technology presents significant challenges. The US Treasury Department has previously sanctioned Tornado Cash for its role in enabling money laundering, yet hackers continue to exploit similar services. As cryptocurrency adoption grows, so too does the threat posed by groups like Lazarus. The latest developments show the urgent need for robust security practices among exchanges, developers, and individual users. Organizations involved in crypto trading and blockchain development must prioritize security measures such as multi-factor authentication, thorough vetting of third-party software, and real-time transaction monitoring to detect and prevent unauthorized access. While blockchain analysis firms like CertiK and Chainalysis continue to track illicit fund movements, the battle against cybercrime remains a game of cat and mouse. Governments and industry leaders must work together to develop more effective countermeasures, ensuring that digital assets remain secure from malicious actors. North Korean Hackers Target Crypto Founders with Fake Zoom Calls in New Social Engineering Scam In related news, a new cyber threat has emerged in the cryptocurrency space as North Korean hackers reportedly attempt to infiltrate and steal sensitive data from prominent crypto founders using deceptive Zoom calls. Over the past few days, at least three crypto executives have reported encounters with this sophisticated phishing scheme, in which hackers pose as venture capitalists or potential business partners to trick their victims into installing malware. Nick Bax, a cybersecurity expert and member of the white hat hacker group Security Alliance, detailed the elaborate scam in a March 11 post on X. According to Bax, the hackers‚Äô modus operandi involves reaching out to their targets with offers of high-profile meetings or partnership opportunities. Once the call begins, they claim to have audio issues while displaying a pre-recorded stock video of a venture capitalist looking disinterested. Shortly thereafter, they send a new link under the guise of resolving the technical issues. However, this alternative link is a trap. ‚ÄùIt‚Äôs a fake link and instructs the target to install a patch to fix their audio/video,‚Äù Bax explained. The hackers exploit human psychology, leveraging the urgency and excitement surrounding business meetings with prominent investors. By making victims believe they are in a critical negotiation, they increase the likelihood of bypassing their usual cybersecurity precautions. ‚ÄùOnce you install the patch, you‚Äôre rekt,‚Äù Bax warned, indicating that the malware effectively compromises the victim‚Äôs system upon installation. Following Bax‚Äôs post, multiple crypto founders came forward to share their own experiences with the scam. Giulio Xiloyannis, co-founder of blockchain gaming company Mon Protocol, revealed that both he and his head of marketing were targeted with a similar phishing attempt. He described how the scammers orchestrated a supposed business meeting centered around a partnership opportunity. However, at the last moment, they insisted he switch to a different Zoom link, citing audio issues. Xiloyannis became suspicious when he noticed names from unrelated companies appearing on the call. ‚ÄùThe moment I saw a Gumicryptos partner speaking and a Superstate one, I realized something was off,‚Äù he noted, ultimately avoiding the malware trap. David Zhang, co-founder of the US venture-backed stablecoin company Stably, also reported being targeted by the scam. However, unlike other cases, the hackers initially used Zhang‚Äôs own Google Meet link before abruptly claiming they needed to switch to an internal meeting. Zhang, who joined the call via tablet, suspects the hackers' malware was designed to detect the target's operating system before deploying its malicious payload. ‚ÄùThe site acted like a normal Zoom call. I took the call on my tablet, though, so I‚Äôm not sure what the behavior would‚Äôve been on desktop,‚Äù he said. It is likely that had he used a PC or Mac, he would have been prompted to install malware disguised as an update or fix. Melbin Thomas, founder of Devdock AI, a decentralized AI platform for Web3 projects, recounted his own harrowing experience with the scam. Thomas admitted to nearly falling for the trap, having gone as far as initiating the installation process before realizing something was amiss. The Lazarus Group Connection The rise in phishing attempts targeting crypto founders coincides with heightened activity from North Korea‚Äôs most notorious cybercrime syndicate‚Äîthe Lazarus Group. The US, Japan, and South Korea issued a joint cybersecurity warning on Jan. 14, flagging the increasing threat posed by North Korean-affiliated hackers in the crypto space. With the increasing prevalence of cyber threats targeting crypto executives, it is crucial to implement best practices for cybersecurity. Here are a few key measures to avoid falling victim to similar scams: Verify Video Call Invitations: Always double-check the sender‚Äôs details before accepting any call invitations, especially those requesting last-minute changes. Avoid Downloading Unknown Software: Never install updates, patches, or fixes from external links during a video call. Use a Separate Device for Sensitive Meetings: Consider taking meetings on a secondary, non-critical device, such as a tablet, which may be less vulnerable to targeted malware.

41593348,https://cointelegraph.com/news/new-marketing-metric-cost-per-wallet-addressable,1741874400,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cointelegraph.png,Web3 firm Addressable introduces new marketing metric for crypto wallets,https://cointelegraph.com/news/new-marketing-metric-cost-per-wallet-addressable?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound,"Web3 marketing firm Addressable has launched cost per wallet (CPW), a new metric aimed at improving user acquisition tracking for decentralized applications (DApps) and blockchain businesses. Announced on March 13, CPW is designed to provide more precise insights for Web3 marketers by tracking onchain wallet activity rather than traditional Web2 advertising metrics like cost per acquisition (CPA) and cost per click (CPC). A lower CPA means customer acquisition is more efficient, while a lower CPC indicates that businesses are implementing more cost-effective ad campaigns. Addressable claims that CPW would allow businesses to determine which users are ‚Äúhigh-value‚Äù and are more likely to get converted into their marketing funnels, helping them optimize their marketing efforts and avoid ‚Äúbots.‚Äù Users with wallets more likely to convert to crypto products Addressable chief operating officer and co-founder Asaf Nadler told Cointelegraph that their analysis data showed that users with a wallet are more likely to convert to crypto products: ‚ÄúOur analysis reveals a striking insight: users with a crypto wallet installed are 18 times more likely to sign up and seven times more likely to convert to crypto products.‚Äù Nadler argued this makes CPW a ‚Äúmore effective‚Äù metric than traditional metrics. The executive said metrics like CPC or cost per impression (CPM) often fail to determine who are high-intent users and which ones are simply ‚Äúlow-quality traffic,‚Äù users who may not be interested in their products. ‚ÄúFor the first time, crypto companies can accurately measure which campaigns drive engaged, high-value users, rather than wasting resources on bots or ‚Äònormies‚Äô who are unlikely to convert,‚Äù Nadler told Cointelegraph. In a press release, Addressable said the new Web3-native acquisition metric could help crypto projects track how many users become active participants in decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols, wallets or exchanges.

The Litecoin (LTC) price drop has raised concerns after a steep 12% decline, dipping below $100 before clawing back up. Analysts are watching closely to see if this is just a blip or the start of something bigger. Meanwhile, the Shiba Inu (SHIB) price is stuck in limbo, battling resistance at the 26-day EMA, with low trading volume making it difficult to push higher. On the other end of the spectrum, BlockDAG (BDAG) races ahead‚Äîits presale surpassing $202.5 million, showing early holders a 2,380% ROI, and now preparing for a global hackathon series starting in March. BlockDAG‚Äôs heavy emphasis on ecosystem growth puts it in the running to be the top crypto for 2025. Key Observations on The 12% Litecoin Price Drop Analysts have noted the Litecoin (LTC) price drop of over 12% in one day, driving LTC below the $100 mark before lifting back up marginally, sitting at $101.51 now. Traders report that the RSI now sits in oversold territory, hinting at a possible short-term bounce, which is already coming to fruition. The Chaikin Money Flow has turned more negative, indicating reduced capital inflows and a cautious sentiment among participants. Some believe the Litecoin price drop may persist if the asset fails to hold above $92.5, potentially opening a path to $80. Observers remain watchful to see whether this Litecoin price drop signifies deeper issues or simply reflects short-lived pessimism. SHIB Price Struggles to Hold Above The 26 EMA Observers have seen the Shiba Inu (SHIB) price struggle against the 26-day Exponential Moving Average, creating frustration for those anticipating a breakthrough. The token currently hovers near $0.00001326, and each attempt to breach the EMA has resulted in a swift rejection. Reduced trading volume also seems to be affecting the Shiba Inu price, as sellers appear more active than buyers. A stable hold above $0.00001550 could encourage a climb toward $0.00001700 or even $0.00001800, though such progress might require a fresh burst of demand. Holders are trying to remain hopeful, but SHIB‚Äôs price continues to face strong resistance, keeping traders on their toes. Hackathon Series Set To Take BlockDAG To Next Level BlockDAG is smashing presale records having reached batch 27, surpassing $202.5 million raised so far and selling 18.7B coins since the presale began. The current coin price stands at $0.0248 and early backers have already seen returns of 2,380%. But BlockDAG is just getting started, the project has eyes on a $600 million target, and organizers believe the upcoming global hackathon series in March 2025 will take things to a whole new level. This event invites crypto enthusiasts from every corner of the globe, offering serious grants, real-world integration opportunities, and BDAG coins as rewards. The hackathon series has been designed for developers, blockchain degens, and simply anyone with a killer idea ‚Äì this is their chance to build, compete, and get noticed. Partnerships with established developer communities such as HackerEarth boost the event‚Äôs visibility, allowing participants to display their projects to potential investors, partners and industry legends. The program encourages new ideas, fosters breakthroughs, and helps participants connect with the community. Top mentors will guide teams, and there is an emphasis on collaboration and real-world impact. The Hackathon Series isn‚Äôt just another event‚Äîit‚Äôs a catalyst for the future of BlockDAG. By bringing in new talent and fresh ideas, the project intends to build a stronger ecosystem. For developers serious about leaving their mark on the blockchain world, they won‚Äôt want to miss this! What‚Äôs Next for Crypto? The Litecoin (LTC) price drop and Shiba Inu (SHIB) price struggles highlight how unpredictable the market can be. LTC has seen a 12% drop and analysts are debating which way the coin will go. SHIB hovers around $0.00001326 but will need to see huge renewed demand to head back up towards previous highs. BlockDAG continues to break new ground, surpassing $202.5 million in presale funding, with early backers already seeing a 2,380% ROI. As its hackathon series begins in March, excitement is growing around its role in blockchain development. Analysts suggest BlockDAG could claim the title of top crypto for 2025, as the presale continues to grow by the day. Especially with major developments ahead, those looking for fresh opportunities may want to keep BlockDAG on their radar as its ecosystem expands.

Elizabeth Warren (MA-D) recently sounded the alarm over new proposals on stablecoin legislation, claiming they‚Äôd give Elon Musk a ‚Äúclear runway‚Äù to control U.S. money and payments. If that sounds overly-dramatic, it‚Äôs because it is. Here's what these bills actually do: the GENIUS Act and the STABLE Act aim to create responsible guardrails for stablecoins, ensuring consumer protection and financial stability while encouraging innovation. Far from handing the keys to a single billionaire, they lay out clear standards so that no one ‚Äî the world‚Äôs richest man or otherwise ‚Äî can dominate payment infrastructure by sidestepping important safeguards. At their core, stablecoins are digital assets designed to maintain a constant value‚Äîmost commonly tied to the U.S. dollar and backed by a basket of reserves. However, the transparency and composition of an issuer‚Äôs dollar reserves may vary, which some regulatory proposals aim to clarify. By definition, dollar-denominated stablecoins reinforce the dollar‚Äôs role in the global economy rather than undermining it. Contrary to the claim that these bills would allow one person to ‚Äúprint money,‚Äù the GENIUS Act and STABLE Act are chiefly about setting minimum reserve, auditing, and licensing standards for stablecoin issuers. The fundamental idea is to ensure transparent, fully backed stablecoins under a clear regulatory regime, not to let a tech titan mint unbacked currency at will. Stablecoins offer innovations the legacy financial system has long struggled to provide: efficient, low-cost transfers, potentially faster settlements, and ability to instantly execute transactions that can fuel new financial products. They can be sent globally in near-real time, lowering barriers and giving everyday users more autonomy over their money, whether that be for remittances or payments for everyday purchases. The size of the global stablecoin ecosystem is notable and is forcing traditional financial entities into the market. The growth in transaction volumes is hard to ignore; they climbed to $710 billion in February, compared with $521 billion in the same month last year. This future of finance is an upgrade over traditional infrastructure, which is dominated by large financial institutions that often dictate costs and limit options for smaller players. By replacing cumbersome, expensive intermediaries, stablecoins empower consumers to transact more directly, preserving their privacy and autonomy without sacrificing efficiency. Stablecoins also bolster national security and support the U.S. dollar‚Äôs global dominance. The U.S. dollar‚Äôs position as the world‚Äôs reserve currency provides significant geopolitical and economic advantages. With the rise of alternative financial systems, including foreign-issued digital assets, the United States must ensure that emerging technologies remain dollar-denominated. If innovators cannot operate within the U.S. under clear rules, they may turn to foreign jurisdictions, effectively weakening the dollar‚Äôs role. Encouraging stablecoin issuers to hold traditional U.S. treasuries as backing ‚Äî rather than synthetic or foreign-issued substitutes ‚Äî helps maintain steady demand for U.S. debt instruments and keeps the dollar anchored at the heart of global finance. At the same time, other countries are exploring strategies to reassert the dollar in ways that loop out American influence ‚Äî so-called ‚Äúde-dollarization‚Äù plans where foreign governments structure their trades and bonds in dollar equivalents without the traditional oversight or support of U.S. institutions. If we do not modernize our own financial infrastructure, we risk losing control over the direction of dollar-based innovation. Providing a predictable regulatory framework for stablecoins helps encourage developers and businesses to keep building on U.S. soil, ensuring that America remains at the forefront of this next wave of finance. Both the GENIUS Act and STABLE Act propose guardrails to ensure stablecoin issuers meet baseline requirements for consumer protection and operational soundness. While each may have its strengths and weaknesses, they reflect a growing effort in Congress to produce thoughtful, bipartisan legislation. Such legislation would reduce uncertainty, spur responsible innovation, and promote healthy competition in the digital asset marketplace. By clarifying legal obligations around reserve composition, auditing, and anti-money laundering practices, these bills aim to foster an environment where stablecoins can thrive under proper oversight ‚Äî protecting consumers, upholding financial stability, and supporting national security interests. Elon Musk‚Äôs interest in digital payments, as with any ambitious project, highlights the larger trend: private sector initiatives are moving rapidly, sometimes outpacing existing laws. Establishing solid regulatory foundations for stablecoins is the first step in ensuring that emerging ventures ‚Äî whether they come from tech entrepreneurs or established financial giants‚Äîmust operate within rules that protect the public and preserve vital U.S. interests. Proper legislation isn‚Äôt about letting a billionaire corner the market. It‚Äôs about providing certainty and accountability so that when a product like ‚ÄúX Money‚Äù or another innovative payment system inevitably comes along, it must meet rigorous standards for consumer protection and financial stability. The future of money is poised to be more digital, transparent, and open. By embracing stablecoin legislation, Congress can strengthen the role of the U.S. dollar, foster innovation at home, and ensure that our financial system remains safe, secure, and competitive. That outcome serves everyday consumers, fortifies national security, and preserves America‚Äôs economic leadership in a rapidly evolving world.",Opinion,EN,0,0,REGULATION|FIAT|MARKET,"{'name': 'CoinDesk', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coindesk.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coindesk,2025-03-13 14:00:32
41593180,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=711420,1741874456,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/newsbtc.png,Dogecoin Breakout Alert! This Pattern Could Trigger A ‚ÄòParabolic‚Äô Surge,https://www.newsbtc.com/news/dogecoin/dogecoin-breakout-alert-parabolic-surge/,"Renowned crypto trader Ali Martinez has released a new update suggesting that Dogecoin could be preparing for a large price upswing. In his latest chart shared on X, Martinez draws attention to the stock RSI on the weekly timeframe. The stock RSI appears poised for a bullish crossover, a signal that has historically preceded major Dogecoin rallies. ‚ÄúDogecoin is about to go parabolic. Historically, when the stock RSI has a bullish crossover on the weekly chart, Dogecoin tends to undergo a significant price rebound,‚Äù Martinez states. He points out that whenever this oscillator crosses bullish on the weekly chart, DOGE typically experiences notable price spikes. Related Reading: Dogecoin‚Äôs Darkest Hour? Sentiment Tanks, Whales Accumulate ‚ÄúFor instance, in October 2023, when the stock RSI had a bullish crossover, Dogecoin surged by 88%.In February 2024, the same thing happened. After the stock RSI had a bullish crossover, Dogecoin surged by 187%. Even in July 2024, Dogecoin rose by 56% after the stock RSI had a bullish crossover. And in September 2024, the price increase was more significant. Dogecoin skyrocketed by 444% after the stock RSI had a bullish crossover on the weekly chart,‚Äù the analyst adds. Dogecoin On The Brink Of A Breakout Martinez also indicates that the current weekly candlestick is attempting to form a doji, a candle with a very small real body that often signals a potential trend reversal, especially when followed by a confirming second candle. ‚ÄúDOGE is printing a potential bullish reversal doji on the weekly chart!‚Äù Martinez writes via X. While it is still too early to call a doji star pattern because the weekly candle will not officially close until Sunday, and the second candle required for confirmation has yet to form, it‚Äôs a promising signal for DOGE bulls. If the ongoing candle preserves its slim real body by the end of the week, and if next week‚Äôs candle confirms this formation, Dogecoin could be setting up for a textbook bullish reversal scenario. Related Reading: This Is The Last Opportunity To Buy Dogecoin ‚ÄòRelatively Cheap,‚Äô Predicts Analyst From a pure price-action perspective, Dogecoin opened this week near $0.16798, reached a high of $0.18082, dipped as low as $0.14297, and has since rebounded toward $0.16766. The tight net change so far explains why the current candlestick appears like a doji, reflecting indecision between buyers and sellers. However, four days remain until the weekly close; intraday volatility could widen or tighten the real body and potentially negate the pattern. Because doji candles often arise during transitional market phases, any upward or downward momentum can quickly distort the candle‚Äôs shape. Although Martinez‚Äôs analysis underscores a potential parabolic move, it is important to stress that confirmation is critical. The second weekly candle for the Doji Star has not yet formed, and the current doji-like candle could vanish if the market experiences a significant shift before Sunday. Traders watching DOGE over the weekend will need to pay close attention to whether it manages to hold its ground near present price levels, thereby preserving a minimal difference between the open and close of the weekly candlestick. If that occurs and next week‚Äôs candle underscores renewed buying pressure, then the Doji Star pattern would be confirmed, potentially foreshadowing a burst to the upside. For now, the market remains in wait-and-see mode. With the stock RSI seemingly ready to cross bullish, the coming days may prove pivotal in determining whether Dogecoin truly is on the cusp of another parabolic upswing. At press time, DOGE traded at $0.16996.

41593341,https://coingape.com/?post_type=markets&p=243978,1741874623,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coingape.png,Top 5 Pepe Coin Rivals to Buy to Turn $1000 to $100K Before May,https://coingape.com/markets/top-5-pepe-coin-rivals-to-buy-to-turn-1000-to-100k-before-may/,"The crypto market remains volatile, with the Pepe coin price crashing by over 75% from its highest level in December last year. This decline is happening as recession risks rise and the crypto fear and greed index remains in the red. Even so, the falling US inflation and the potential for Federal Reserve rate cuts may boost some Pepe Coin rivals like Terra Luna Classic (LUNC), Binance Coin (BNB), IOTA (IOTA), Ripple (XRP), and Algorand (ALGO). Best Pepe Coin Rivals to Buy to Turn $1K to $100K The best Pepe rivals to buy for big gains should have good fundamentals and technicals. These tokens like LUNC, BNB, IOTA, XRP, and ALGO have both. Terra Luna Classic (LUNC) LUNC is a good Pepe coin rival to buy because of its fundamentals and technicals. Fundamentally, the network is burning millions of coins each week, reducing the number of tokens in circulation. Technically, on the weekly chart, the coin has found a strong bottom at $0.000053, where it has failed to move below since September 2023. That is a sign that it has formed a triple-bottom, pointing to a strong bullish breakout. A move to the neckline at $0.0001798 points to a near 200% surge. LUNC Price Chart Binance Coin (BNB) BNB price is one of the top Pepe coin rivals because of the upcoming Pascal upgrade and its growing market share in the DEX industry. Technically, BNB has formed a cup and handle pattern , the depth of which is about 71%.¬†Measuring this distance from the upper side would point to more gains to $1,142. BNB Price Chart IOTA (IOTA) IOTA is also one of the top Pepe coin rivals to buy for huge gains. The main catalyst is that IOTA will launch its rebased upgrade this month. Rebased will introduce new features, including MoveVM and Ethereum EVM, and staking with between 10% and 15% returns. IOTA price has also formed a quadruple bottom and a falling wedge pattern. Therefore, the coin will likely bounce back, and possibly to the neckline at $0.6362, the highest swing in December, which is about 257% above the current level. IOTA Price Chart Ripple (XRP) XRP is also another top Pepe rival to buy because of its fundamentals. First, Ripple may become a big competitor to SWIFT network , which will boost XRP‚Äôs utility. Second, there are rising odds of an XRP ETF approval by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Just this week, Franklin Templeton filed for an XRP ETF approval from the SEC. Third, there is a likelihood that the SEC will drop the Ripple lawsuit. The only risk for XRP price is that it has formed a head and shoulders pattern. Algorand (ALGO) The most bullish case for Algorand as a Pepe coin is that it has formed a quadruple bottom at $0.090. It has also formed a falling wedge pattern on the daily and weekly charts, pointing to an eventual rebound. A move to its 2024 high of $0.6100 would signal a 207% from the current level. ALGO Price Chart Summary on the Best Pepe Rivals to Buy There are many crypto tokens to buy now that the Pepe coin price has plunged by over 70%. These five ones, Algorand, XRP, LUNC, IOTA, and BNB are good options to buy. Other notable coins are Dogecoin, Floki, and Bonk are good alternatives.

41593379,https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2025/03/ethereum-testnets-holesky-reaches-finality-following-pectra-upgrade-launch,1741874710,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/75/41593379.jpeg,Ethereum Testnets Holesky Reaches Finality Following Pectra Upgrade Launch,https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2025/03/ethereum-testnets-holesky-reaches-finality-following-pectra-upgrade-launch,"Ethereum‚Äôs Holesky testnet finally achieved finality two weeks after the Pectra upgrade went live. The testnet developers have reported that the complications that delayed the process are now fully solved. However, its sister testnet network, Sepolia, faced issues in achieving finality on the Petctra upgrade following an exploit on March 5. The issue is now resolved. The Pectra upgrade, the biggest update on Ethereum since The Merge, went live on February 24 after being postponed earlier in the year. Now, one of the largest Ethereum testnets, Holesky, has achieved finality two weeks following the Pectra upgrade going live. On March 10, at around 19.00 UTC, the Holesky testnet developers announced that the network achieved finality, where all transactions on Holesky are now immutable and irreversible. The feat was achieved on Epoch 119,090, with over two-thirds of the validators validating the network. The network now locks the transactions irreversibly within two epochs, or 13 minutes. According to the team, the upgrade had been absent since it launched due to a configuration bug in the client software, not the Pectra upgrade itself. This is the first step towards Pectra upgrade being integrated onto the main Ethereum network, if successful on the testnet trials. Ethereum developers and the community use these trial updates to ensure that bugs are fixed before they go live. It‚Äôs all to avoid disrupting the main Ethereum blockchain in the process. Speaking on the recent challenges of Holesky on reaching finality and when the mainnet launch date can be confirmed, Danyal Hanif, Ethereum Product Lead, P2P.org, an ETH staking service, stated: ‚ÄúSo right now, we presume a lot of the Ethereum Ecosystem is testing Pectra, primarily in Holesky, which has been facing issues that seem to be resolved as finality was achieved on 10th March. Given this, we are still waiting for an updated Mainnet release date with an expectation of mid-April.‚Äù The Holesky development team worked on the configuration bug in the client software over the past two weeks. Developers are now stabilizing nodes and pruning old states to fully revive the testnet for Pectra testing. Understanding the Pectra Upgrade The Pectra upgrade aims to solve long-standing challenges on the Ethereum blockchain, such as high transaction fees, complexity in staking for new users and the maximum ETH lock-up for validators. The upgrade will make the blockchain faster, more scalable and easier to use for blockchain users, developers and validators. First, the upgrade will allow users to pay for transactions and signatures with several cryptocurrencies other than ETH, including stablecoins. In addition, the Pectra upgrade also introduces validators with Max Effective Balances (MEB) of up to 2048 ETH. Currently, validators can stake up to a maximum of 32 ETH to secure the network and earn rewards in return, However, this is not very efficient as any amount staked higher than 32 ETH does not receive extra rewards. With the new upgrade, validators on P2P.org will be able to stake up to 2048 ETH, allowing them to reduce operational costs, which translates into higher profitability. Speaking on how the Pectra upgrade will advance Ethereum users' capabilities, Alex Loktev, CRO at P2P.org, stated: ‚ÄúThe upgrade from 32 ETH staking cap to 2048 ETH will make staking more flexible and enhance the overall security of Ethereum. The move will see companies and individuals who manage large amounts of ETH choose to stake their tokens, which improves the speed in finalizing blocks and improves consensus efficiency.‚Äù The upgrade was scheduled to be launched on the mainnet in early March 2025 , but the community decided to push the date back. This was to give developers and the community more time to fully test the upgrade amid the recent technical failures during Holesky and Sepolia testnet deployments.

Secure, Gasless, and Smarter Trading Another standout feature is BinoFi‚Äôs Multi-Party Computation (MPC) wallet system. This non-custodial wallet ensures top-tier security without needing seed phrases, while guaranteeing users easy account recovery. Additionally, traders benefit from gasless transactions, a welcome departure from the soaring fees that many crypto investors face, particularly on networks like Ethereum. To top it off, BinoFi leverages an AI-enhanced trading engine. This machine-learning system handles automated order routing, intelligent risk management, and even trade optimization. Imagine an exchange that not only processes your trades but actively works to maximize returns based on market conditions. It‚Äôs a glimpse into the future of user-centric trading platforms. The Trade-to-Earn Revolution BinoFi isn‚Äôt just a platform for trading; it‚Äôs a space where users are rewarded for actively contributing to liquidity and engagement. Through its Trade-to-Earn model, traders can earn rewards, incentivizing consistent activity on the platform. Combine this with upcoming social features like leaderboards and copy trading, and BinoFi is setting the stage for a new way of thinking about trader engagement. A Roadmap Packed with Milestones Early adoption is often accompanied by significant risks, but BinoFi is working to mitigate these concerns with a clear and well-thought-out roadmap. The MVP launch will introduce core features like off-chain order matching with on-chain settlement and an intuitive interface built for both seasoned and novice traders. Following this, expansions like algorithmic trading tools, DeFi integrations, and governance systems will further enhance its ecosystem. By 2027, BinoFi plans a full transition into a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO), cementing its commitment to giving power to the community while maintaining alignment with global regulatory standards through Zero-Knowledge (ZK) KYC solutions. These steps are designed to balance security, compliance, and innovation, paving the way for sustainable growth. Why Insiders Are Betting on BinoFi Crypto insiders aren‚Äôt accumulating BinoFi just because of its features but because of its timing and market positioning. With cross-chain interoperability becoming increasingly critical, projects capable of fixing it are set to lead the next wave of blockchain adoption. BinoFi‚Äôs presale success, roadmap execution, and early community support suggest it has what it takes to claim a significant slice of the market by 2025. For investors, BinoFi offers a rare mix of high-growth potential and usability. It‚Äôs not just another trading platform; it‚Äôs a comprehensive ecosystem designed for scalability, accessibility, and the future demands of global blockchain adoption. Your Next Move If you‚Äôve been searching for the next big opportunity in crypto, BinoFi deserves your attention. Whether you‚Äôre diversifying a portfolio built on established giants or looking to stake a claim in a rising star, the early-stage potential of BinoFi could yield outsized returns for investors who act now. The crypto landscape is dynamic, and the winners are often those who spot innovation before the crowd.

To read full editions, subscribe . Bitcoin‚Äôs had some strong sell-side pressure since the start of the year. I know, not shocking. But bear with me, yeah? Glassnode tracked bitcoin‚Äôs cyclical behavior, finding that the latest ‚Äúdistribution phase‚Äù (aka selling) started back in January. Chart showing bitcoin accumulation trends in the past 2 years The Accumulation Trend Score, which ‚Äúmeasures the relative change in aggregate onchain balances,‚Äù is still signaling that there‚Äôll be more sell-side pressure. Unfortunately, the score is also influenced by the moves of larger entities. Prior to late February, there was a pattern of adding to bitcoin positions in the $95,000 to $98,000 range, but that fell off as liquidity conditions changed (thanks, macro). A look at the accumulation range and its subsequent dip Now the accumulation range sits between $78,000 and $92,000, which Glassnode labeled as ‚Äúweak.‚Äù See? Glassnote chart of ‚ÄúWeak Accumulation‚Äù period, from Feb. 23-Mar. 9 So it‚Äôs starting to look like we‚Äôre not getting as many folks interested in buying the dip right now. ‚ÄúUsing the cost-basis of Short-Term Holders, we can see that market momentum and capital flows have turned negative, signaling a decline in demand strength, and investor uncertainty is affecting sentiment and confidence,‚Äù Glassnode wrote. Reading into this: I‚Äôm not all that surprised, especially given the headlines around a potential US recession and some weaker-than-we-wanted economic data. And I know what you‚Äôre thinking: ‚ÄúInvesting in bitcoin diversifies your portfolio away from the macro of it all!‚Äù You‚Äôre not wrong. But you‚Äôre also not entirely right . Glassnode‚Äôs note „Éº that a lot of this is coming from bigger entities „Éº means that the institutions who are getting exposure to bitcoin will also be more likely to offload it as a risk asset when the environment becomes a bit too risk-on. We‚Äôre just not there yet in the whole ‚Äúbitcoin‚Äôs digital gold‚Äù argument. But hey, we‚Äôre making strides every single cycle. Get the news in your inbox.

41596725,https://coinpaprika.com/news/spicy-projects-8-coti-foundation,1741880131,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/80/41596725.jpeg,Spicy Projects #8: COTI Foundation,https://coinpaprika.com/news/spicy-projects-8-coti-foundation,"What is COTI Foundation? COTI Foundation is developing the fastest and lightest confidentiality layer on Ethereum . Originally launched in 2017 as a payments platform, COTI has evolved to address one of blockchain's most pressing challenges: privacy. The team recognized that without robust privacy solutions, mainstream adoption by traditional financial institutions would remain limited. Powered by breakthrough cryptography called Garbled Circuits and secured by Ethereum, COTI introduces the most advanced and compliant solution for data protection on public blockchains. This innovative approach unlocks a new world of use cases including confidential transactions, AI integration, enhanced DeFi, and decentralized identification ‚Äì all with privacy at the core. Garbled Circuits: The Privacy Game-Changer What sets COTI apart is their approach to privacy. While many projects use Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZKPs) or Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs), COTI partnered with Soda Labs to implement Garbled Circuits (GCs), offering several key advantages: Incredible Efficiency : COTI's implementation is 1,800-3,000x faster than closest alternativeFully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE) solutions True Decentralization : Unlike TEEs, Garbled Circuits don't require trusted hardware or introduce supply chain risks Flexible Multi-Party Computation : Multiple users can provide encrypted inputs, something ZKPs cannot handle Here's how it works: Any blockchain transaction can be described as a ""circuit"" ‚Äì a series of logic gates. COTI encrypts or ""garbles"" this circuit so each gate takes encrypted input and produces encrypted output. Only users with the proper keys can decrypt the final output, ensuring complete privacy throughout the entire process. Privacy-on-Demand and Cross-Chain Integration COTI's ""Privacy-on-Demand"" feature is a confidential cross-chain solution that will enable private transactions with minimal friction across all major blockchains. This is made possible through integration with Axelar, creating a seamless privacy experience regardless of which blockchain you're using. The mainnet launch scheduled for late Q1 2025 will be a milestone moment, with V1 tokens migrating to the new L2. Currently, the technology is undergoing rigorous testing on the testnet, preparing for what promises to be a transformative launch. Why COTI Matters Privacy isn't just a nice-to-have feature ‚Äì it's essential for Web3 adoption by traditional businesses. Many TradFi organizations simply cannot use public blockchains without robust privacy measures due to: Regulatory compliance with data protection laws Protection against MEV attacks and front-running Sensitive business information that cannot be exposed on public ledgers COTI bridges this critical gap, potentially unlocking billions in institutional capital that has remained on the sidelines due to privacy concerns. What's Next? 2025 is shaping up to be COTI's breakout year with several initiatives: Confidential DeFi : Partnerships with major platforms including Bancor and EEA to bring privacy to decentralized finance AI and Web3 Integration : Working at the intersection of artificial intelligence and blockchain with privacy as the connective tissue RWA Platforms : Enabling real-world asset tokenization with the privacy these assets require CBDC Innovation : The team has even contributed to the Digital Shekel Challenge, creating a proof of concept CBDC platform for the Bank of Israel Fun Fact COTI's garbled circuit implementation is so efficient that it can process private transactions with approximately the same computational resources as a standard non-private transaction ‚Äì a feat previously thought impossible in blockchain privacy solutions. From its origins as a payment platform to becoming a cutting-edge privacy solution, COTI Foundation represents one of the most promising infrastructure plays in Web3 . By solving the privacy problem without sacrificing performance or decentralization, COTI is positioning itself at the center of the next wave of blockchain adoption.

The exact parameters of the listing remain uncertain as the platform makes its next big expansion into meme tokens. Robinhood listed Pudgy Penguins (PENGU), POPCAT, and Peanut the Squirrel (PNUT). The brokerage service posted a link to a PNUT page , which was temporarily inactive. Later, Robinhood confirmed the listings with an official message on X. Pengu also confirmed the listing, which would add to its mainstream outreach. PENGU ($PENGU), PNUT ($PNUT), and POPCAT ($POPCAT) are now available to trade on Robinhood. GM. pic.twitter.com/Pl4rpXHSnE ‚Äî Robinhood (@RobinhoodApp) March 13, 2025 The Robinhood account on X posted an update after the rumors of the new listing spread. The most recent addition to the Robinhood app was Arbitrum (ARB), listed on March 5. The stock trading app has been cautious in adding new crypto assets but recently tried to engage crypto traders with additional social media posts . Robinhood has been instrumental in the previous waves of crypto adoption. The app was relatively late to add Dogecoin (DOGE), but soon added several blue chip memes. Pudgy Penguins is currently on the list of available assets on Robinhood, but PNUT and POPCAT were considered potential candidates. Robinhood has already taken up PEPE, BONK, WIF, and SHIB, which emerged as the most liquid meme assets. The new additions, if they are finalized, would add slightly less liquid tokens. While PENGU has high visibility and a blue chip status, POPCAT and PNUT may be more volatile and depend on smaller communities. The Robinhood known wallet does not contain any additional deposits of the newly listed tokens. If the listings happen, this may bring new liquidity to the slumping meme space. Robinhood‚Äôs listings often lag behind crypto trends but sometimes revive trading by bringing new retail inflows. POPCAT, PENGU, PNUT all trade near lows All three assets that may be added to Robinhood are trading near their lower range. POPCAT lost some of its used base in the past three months, with 76% of whale wallets abandoning the meme. POPCAT ownership has consolidated in the past month, potentially hoping for a new meme cycle. POPCAT is a community-based token with some characteristics of a cult. Despite this, POPCAT was actively traded for short-term profits. PENGU also lost more than 30% of its holders in the past month and even more in the past three months. Despite the initial cult status linked to the Pudgy Penguins community, PENGU could not compete with hotter memes and Pump.fun tokens. Despite this, PENGU remains liquid and may make a comeback. Pudgy Penguins are already known for their physical collections, and a Robinhood listing would add to the mainstream attention. Peanut the Squirrel (PNUT) was a short-term success around November 2024, riding on the hype of the US elections. PNUT trades near its lower range at $0.16, still benefitting from listings on Binance and other centralized exchanges. PNUT is considered riskier because it served as a short-term meme token. The token lost over 90% of its value during the most active part of the bull market and is the riskiest new listing on Robinhood. The asset was also considered a token linked to the US election narrative, and it will have to find new support or risk low activity. Memes remain capable of rapid comebacks, especially if there is a reason for focused attention. Whale traders and smart money still wait on the sidelines as the meme market returns to levels before November 2024. Robinhood lists memes during a market slump The new Robinhood listing would have been considered bullish. At this stage of the market, interest in memes and altcoins is extremely low. Bitcoin (BTC) is also struggling to retain its position above $80,000. The listing announcement hardly caused a market reaction, with all three assets rising less than 20%. This is an extremely small rally for meme tokens, reflecting the overall pessimistic market sentiment. However, the Robinhood listing is also considered a potentially positive sign, betting on a market recovery and renewed attention for well-established, liquid memes. POPCAT also retains its Coinbase listing, with recently added support on Solana. Cryptopolitan Academy: Want to grow your money in 2025? Learn how to do it with DeFi in our upcoming webclass.

This is due to unclear trade policy and the weakening U.S. job market. Barclays analysts said , ‚ÄúThe softer labor market causes us to add another rate cut, despite higher inflation.‚Äù It had earlier projected one 25-basis point cut in June. According to the analysts, the first rate cut in June will reflect indications of slower growth and rising unemployment. The second rate cut in September will reflect indications of a rising unemployment rate and some signs of improvement in monthly inflation prints. After the September rate cut, Barclays thinks the central bank will take a long break and start cutting rates again in March 2026. Demand for workers will go down ‚Äì Barclays Consumer prices in the U.S. rose less than expected in February. The consumer price index (CPI) increased 0.2% last month after increasing 0.5% in January. Economists had predicted the CPI would increase 0.3%. Prices increased 0.2% on a ‚Äúcore‚Äù measure, which excludes the more volatile costs of things like gas and food. This was less than January‚Äôs 0.4% monthly gain and 3.1% over the previous year. This was the smallest annual increase in core CPI since April 2021. It was also less than the 3.3% rise in core prices seen in the previous month and more than what the Bloomberg average expected. It was the first time since July that both the headline CPI and the core CPI showed that prices were rising less quickly. This is such a relief, considering the uncertainty around Trump‚Äôs policies. Therefore, Barclays thinks that this year, the demand for workers will go down along with the slowing of the job market. They said, ‚ÄúWe think that the relatively sharp slowdown in job gains will be accompanied by only a moderate rise in the unemployment rate, which would peak at 4.3% in October.‚Äù Barclays also dropped its growth predictions for Q4/Q4 2025 from 1.5% to 0.7%. Fed‚Äôs stance on interest rates Recently, Jerome Powell, the head of the Federal Reserve, said that the central bank is not in a hurry to lower interest rates because policy uncertainty is still making markets nervous and the outlook for the US economy unsure. Powell said, ‚ÄúAs we parse the incoming information, we are focused on separating the signal from the noise as the outlook evolves We do not need to be in a hurry and are well-positioned to wait for greater clarity.‚Äù The head of the central bank said in a Q&A session after his speech that the cost of being cautious is very low. According to Powell, the Trump administration is changing policies in many areas, such as trade, taxes, government spending, immigration, and rules. He also said that what will matter for the economy and the Fed‚Äôs interest rate policies is the net effect of these changes. At its January policy meeting, the Fed kept the overnight interest rate between 4.25 and 4.50%. Chair Jerome Powell said the bank would wait to cut rates again until reports on inflation and jobs showed it was time.

While the allure of meme coins often lies in their speculative appeal, their lack of inherent value and reliance on hype make them highly vulnerable to volatility. For many investors, the rapid rise of projects like PEPE was exciting, but its downturn highlights a recurring issue in the cryptocurrency market. Meme coins often struggle to build sustainable ecosystems or deliver utility that justifies long-term holding. Now, attention is shifting toward tokens with real-world use cases, and BinoFi (BINO) is emerging as a clear favorite. What Makes BinoFi (BINO) Different? Unlike meme coins, BinoFi is utility-driven, aiming to solve real challenges in the crypto trading landscape. It has rapidly gained traction as the first hybrid cryptocurrency exchange, blending the strengths of centralized and decentralized exchanges into one powerful platform. BinoFi brings unmatched features to the table, starting with its cross-chain trading without bridges. This innovation simplifies transactions across multiple blockchains, eliminating the risks and inefficiencies associated with traditional wrapped tokens or third-party bridges. For traders, this means faster, safer, and more cost-effective transactions. Adding to its appeal is BinoFi‚Äôs Multi-Party Computation (MPC) wallet system, a non-custodial solution that enhances security while offering gasless transactions. This is a game-changer for users exhausted by high gas fees and clunky key management protocols. The Rise of Utility Tokens The crypto market is evolving, and investors are increasingly prioritizing utility over speculation. Tokens like BinoFi, which offer tangible value through advanced trading systems and user-centric features, are capturing the attention of forward-thinking investors. BinoFi‚Äôs platform goes beyond just trading. It incentivizes engagement through its Trade-to-Earn model, rewarding traders and making it a highly interactive ecosystem. Unlike the fleeting popularity of meme coins, utility tokens like BinoFi are positioned for sustained growth, supported by strong infrastructure and a clear roadmap. Why BinoFi Is Gaining Momentum BinoFi‚Äôs rise is no coincidence. The project has seen early success with a highly oversubscribed presale, signaling strong community interest. Upcoming milestones, such as the launch of its Minimum Viable Product (MVP) and planned transition toward decentralized governance via a DAO, have further fueled investor confidence. What truly sets BinoFi apart is its hybrid liquidity model , combining the trading depth of centralized exchanges with the transparency and autonomy of decentralized platforms. This dual approach ensures that users get the best execution for every trade without sacrificing control or security. Actionable Insights for Investors The recent decline of PepeCoin serves as a reminder of the risks posed by speculative investing. For those looking to pivot toward more sustainable opportunities, BinoFi represents a compelling option. By addressing real-world needs and delivering an ecosystem that caters to traders, it offers a much-needed alternative to hype-based projects. Investors who act now have the chance to capitalize on BinoFi‚Äôs early-stage growth. Its combination of cross-chain functionality, gasless transactions, and user rewards makes it one of the most exciting utility-driven tokens on the market.

All allegations were withdrawn without financial settlement. The resolution in the case (Case: CL-2024-000213) was reached after the Islam brothers submitted evidence supporting their position that the allegations were unfounded. Unlike typical settlements, this one concluded without any financial payment from the Islam brothers to the claimants. Instead, the claimants have agreed to contribute to the legal costs incurred by the Islam brothers in defending themselves against these allegations. This development brings closure to a case that had significant implications for the brothers' business reputation and personal lives. ""For years, misinformation surrounding OneCoin has affected my reputation, including allegations of dishonesty, fraud, and fleeing the UK. This resolution shows we have been telling the truth. We've been unfairly targeted, and this is a vital step in setting the record straight,"" said Moyn Islam. His brother Monir added, ""This resolution is not only a victory for us but also for the principles of justice."" Jennifer McAdam, a key member of the Claimant group's steering committee, has also released official statements available on Facebook , X (previously Twitter) , and Instagram confirming the withdrawal of claims.¬†This resolution was made public on January 25, 2025. Moyn and Monir Islam were small-scale UK investors who themselves lost money to the OneCoin fraud. They held no leadership roles in OneCoin's operations or management, and once their suspicions grew about the scheme, they actively sought to warn others. The brothers‚Äô business ventures, including Melius - later rebranded as BE Club - have been misrepresented. Additionally, some critics have wrongly alleged that Moyn and Monir Islam fled to Dubai after the collapse of the scheme, despite clear evidence showing their move was a strategic business decision that took place gradually over several years. The resolution includes a binding agreement preventing any future OneCoin-related claims against the Islam brothers. The brothers were represented by separate law firms, which have put out statements on the resolution: Enyo Law & Peters & Peters . OneCoin was a cryptocurrency scheme that defrauded investors of approximately $4 billion before its founder disappeared in 2017. Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

The Chicago Board Options Exchange (CBOE) has officially filed a 19b-4 form to list and trade shares of the Franklin XRP ETF, marking another important step toward approval. Following this news, XRP‚Äôs price jumped by 7% to $2.3. CBOE Pushes for XRP ETF Approval The CBOE has submitted a 19b-4 form to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) on behalf of Franklin Templeton. This filing is the second major step in the ETF approval process, following the firm‚Äôs initial S-1 registration form. If approved, the Franklin XRP ETF would be traded on CBOE, with Coinbase Custody handling XRP storage. The SEC has been taking its time reviewing crypto-related ETF applications. In fact, it recently delayed its decision on two other XRP ETF proposals from Grayscale and Canary Capital. However, industry experts believe this is a standard process rather than a rejection. Franklin Templeton‚Äôs Big Crypto Plans Franklin Templeton has shown a growing interest in the crypto space. Earlier this year, Roger Bayston, head of the firm‚Äôs digital asset strategy, shared that the company is looking to expand its crypto ETF offerings beyond Bitcoin and Ethereum. Their focus for 2025 is diversification, which means more ETFs linked to different cryptocurrencies. If approved, the Franklin XRP ETF would allow investors to gain exposure to XRP‚Äôs price movements without having to own or store the assets themselves. Meanwhile, this could open the door for more institutional and retail investors looking for safer ways to invest in crypto. More XRP ETFs on the Horizon? Franklin Templeton‚Äôs XRP ETF isn‚Äôt the only one awaiting approval. Other major firms, including Bitwise, 21Shares, Grayscale, CoinShares, and WisdomTree, have also submitted filings for similar products. Meanwhile, the excitement isn‚Äôt just around XRP. Interest in alternative crypto ETFs is growing, with filings now extending to assets like Solana (SOL), Dogecoin (DOGE), Cardano (ADA), Litecoin (LTC), and Hedera (HBAR).",News,EN,0,0,XRP|EXCHANGE|ADA|BUSINESS|DOGE,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-03-13 15:42:14
41597031,https://coingape.com/?post_type=markets&p=243935,1741880583,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coingape.png,Here‚Äôs Why Pi Network Price Collapsed from $100 to $2 & Why it May Never Hit $100 Again,https://coingape.com/markets/heres-why-pi-network-price-collapsed-from-100-to-2-why-it-may-never-hit-100-again/,"Pi Network price has pulled back from its all-time high. It initially peaked at almost $3 after the airdrop in February and has crashed by 45% to below $2. Pi coin remains significantly below the IoU price of $100, which it reached in November last year. This article explores why the value of Pi has retreated and why it may never jump to $100 again. Why Pi Network Price Crashed from $100 to $2 The Pi Network price has dropped to slightly below $2 this week. This price is much lower than what the $100 that its IoU reached in November last year. This decline is because the Pi Network IoU and the current Pi Network are different assets. Several exchanges like BitMart and HTX listed the Pi Network IoU in 2022 as impatient among pioneers grew. These pioneers were largely concerned that the mainnet launch was taking longer than expected. Therefore, these Pi Network IoUs were used as proxies for the Pi Network project until the mainnet launch happened this year. HTX, whose token peaked at $100 in November, delisted it ahead of the mainnet launch and has now listed the main token. There are four main reasons why the Pi Network price has dropped from the all-time high of $3 to the current $1.7200. First, the decline mirrors the performance of most recently launched tokens. Most tokens like Grass, Hamster Kombat, and Wormhole have dropped from their highest levels after the aidrop. Second, there are concerns about the future Pi coin token unlocks. 188 million tokens will be released this month, while over 1.4 billion will be unlocked by December this year. Token unlocks lead to dilution, affecting existing holders. Further, Pi Network price has dropped as the much-anticipated Binance listing remains on ice. Most participants in the Pi coin listing poll voted to allow it to go on, but the listing date has not been confirmed yet. Other mainnet exchanges like Coinbase and Upbit have also not listed it. Fourth, Pi Network has crashed because of the ongoing trends in the crypto industry, where most cryptocurrencies have dropped . Bitcoin has dropped from $109,300 in January to $84,000 today. Historically, most altcoins have a close correlation with BTC. Why Pi Coin Price May Never Hit $100 Pi Network is still in its price discovery phase. Critics argue that the coin‚Äôs best days are now behind it and that its upside will be limited, while proponents argue that the coin will copy Bitcoin‚Äôs price action and surge to $100 and above over time. Chances are that the Pi Network price may never jump to $100. To do that, the coin needs to jump by over 5,700% from the current level. Such a move would bring its market cap to over $700 billion. Its fully diluted valuation would be $10 trillion, making it bigger than the current crypto market size. Pi Price Forecast The two-hour chart shows that the Pi Network price peaked around $3 in February and then retreated. It now remains slightly above the ascending trendline that connects the lowest swings since February 23. This trendline is likely the neckline of the head and shoulders pattern, a popular bearish sign. Pi Network price chart Pi coin has also formed a rising wedge pattern, pointing to a potential bearish breakdown in the past few days. Such a move would see it crash below $1 even as the Pi Day happens . A move above the resistance at $2 will invalidate the bearish Pi coin price forecast .

""This Data Gives Hope in Bitcoin!"" So Is the Fall Over?",https://en.bitcoinsistemi.com/cryptoquant-analyst-explained-this-data-gives-hope-in-bitcoin-so-is-the-fall-over/,"Bitcoin (BTC) has been in a downtrend for weeks, with analysts divided over what's next. While some analysts expect the decline to continue and drop to $70,000, some analysts think that Bitcoin has bottomed. Evaluating Bitcoin's movements at this point, CryptoQuant analyst argued that Bitcoin could recover without further sharp declines. Stating that Bitcoin has entered the oversold region after the last correction, the analyst said that the Bitcoin MVRV ratio has fallen to the level of 1.8 and is approaching the 2024 low of 1.71. According to the analyst, if BTC drops to $70,000, the MVRV ratio could reach last year's lows. However, the analyst said that BTC could potentially recover without further sharp declines as market sentiment has already weakened significantly, selling by large investors (whales) in the market has slowed down, and BTC is in oversold territory. Finally, in response to questions about whether a bear market has begun, the analyst added that although market sentiment is weak, it is too early to conclude that BTC has entered a full-fledged downward cycle. ‚ÄúThe MVRV ratio, a key metric for assessing Bitcoin‚Äôs price, has fallen to 1.8, approaching the 2024 correction low of 1.71. If Bitcoin falls into the $70,000 range, the MVRV ratio could reach a level similar to the bottom of the 2024 correction. However, market sentiment has weakened significantly at the moment, with altcoins surrendering most of their gains, leaving the majority of investors unprofitable this cycle. This suggests that even without an additional sharp decline, the market has already softened enough to become a suitable area for a potential upward move without the need for further significant declines. Currently, the market is in the final stages of an upcycle and is experiencing a strong correction, which increases both risk and investment difficulty. When the market enters an oversold state at this point, the probability of a recovery also increases. Correlation with stock market and economic trends Despite the current recession, most cryptocurrencies, including Bitcoin, are oversold, suggesting that a recovery is not far off. *This is not investment advice.

41597585,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=692330,1741880640,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/41597585.jpeg,"Solana, Cardano And XRP Set To Be Pushed Aside By This New Viral Altcoin",https://www.cryptopolitan.com/solana-cardano-and-xrp-set-to-be-pushed-aside-by-this-new-viral-altcoin/,"Sentiment changed drastically with the collapse of the majority of the meme coin ventures, losing overall billions of dollars. It brought back the traders towards the old-timer coins like SOL, ADA and XRP, which all try hard to remain at the top amidst the ever-expanding market. Nonetheless, there is a dark horse called Remittix that is slowly gaining ground with PayFi solutions and real-world applications. Below, we review how SOL, ADA and XRP came to enjoy their high rankings, why their growth might be met with new issues, and how Remittix‚Äôs real-world applications can propel it into the leading crypto rankings. Solana (SOL) Targets High-Throughput Mastery A direct substitute for mainstream blockchains for a long time now, SOL fuels a network prioritizing high-throughput speeds and low fees. DeFi protocols, NFT platforms and gaming ventures found refuge on Solana when congestion hit other networks. Despite all this, isolated network congestion tainted the reliability record for SOL. Competition with other chains and layer-two rollups also limits its ability to function as a platform of choice for dApp deployment. The platform‚Äôs detractors cite the fact that frequent outages, as ongoing as they are, could erode developers‚Äô confidence against stable rivals. Cardano (ADA) Emphasizes Academic Rigor Often described as a science-oriented blockchain, ADA (the native cryptocurrency of Cardano) gained its loyal community through the emphasis placed upon rigorously formalized approaches and peer-reviewed ingenuity. ADA‚Äôs proof-of-stake Ouroboros protocol facilitating ADA usage is unique through its energy efficiency, a quality to which environmentally aware investors are drawn. Still, observers question whether ADA can keep pace with faster and nimbler blockchains capable of adding new features quickly. While academic rigor validates the solidity of Cardano, it also enables updates slowly enough not to keep pace with sudden changes in the marketplace. Joint ventures with emerging economies and identity management schemes point towards the chain‚Äôs ambitions to tackle the world‚Äôs problems but the longer timelines of Cardano sometimes strain investor impatience. XRP‚Äôs Cross-Border Agenda Faces Competition XRP was the de facto instant and low-cost cross-border payment token for many years. With daily trading volumes sometimes surpassing the $6 billion threshold, XRP enjoyed the privilege of bank alliances testing out blockchain remittances. Nonetheless, the crypto competition centered around remittance now seems very different. There are now competing alternatives covering the space from peer-to-peer lending through fiat-to-crypto direct conversion and challenging the token‚Äôs formerly singular demand. Moreover, the ongoing lawsuits call into question the token‚Äôs broader institutional acceptance. With the trend shifting towards usage by mainstream consumers, the coin also now competes with the coins facilitating cross-border payments without the possibility of regulatory uncertainty hanging over them. Remittix Poised For Viral Rise Although ADA, SOL and XRP are well regarded, a new token named Remittix could make them redundant. Remittix is famous for bridging the gap between mainstream banking and cryptocurrency and excels at converting digital assets into fiat and moving money into foreign bank accounts cheaply and quickly. This PayFi model raised over $13.8 million through presales, confirming there is strong demand for useful crypto utilities. Priced at the token price of $0.0734, Remittix is set to replicate or beat patterns of expansion previously seen with legacy chains. A live example illustrates the appeal of Remittix. A Philippine-based independent architect is paid a commission from Europe. The old wire transfer would take a few business days and 5% charge or more of profits. With Remittix, the architect can shorten settlement time into minutes with minimal expense. With over $700 billion yearly cross-border remittances involved, exposure to just a portion of this segment would propel Remittix‚Äôs market capitalization into the stratosphere above the incumbent industry leaders. It‚Äôs described as the ‚Äúnext big altcoin,‚Äù with the emphasis placed on actual-world usage instead of short-term hype. Observers note that while SOL, ADA, and XRP target different markets speed, scholarliness and cross-national money transfer, Remittix combines instant utility within a single platform. Greater accessibility could trump even longer-standing coins with a reputation for singular areas of interest. The Altcoin Poised To Eclipse Giants Despite SOL‚Äôs dynamic throughput, ADA‚Äôs meticulous development and XRP‚Äôs cross-border focus, all three risk ceding ground to a new wave of altcoins marrying blockchain efficiency with real-world finance. Remittix exemplifies this trend, converting crypto to fiat in minutes, drastically cutting remittance fees, and appealing to both retail users and enterprises. Its presale success over $13.8 million underscores how the market craves utility rather than short-lived hype. In an evolving sector, even well-known tokens can be usurped if they fail to adapt or deliver widespread adoption. SOL must resolve performance hiccups, ADA must prove its rigorous upgrades scale quickly enough and XRP must navigate regulatory uncertainties. Meanwhile, Remittix leaps ahead by solving everyday payment headaches, embodying the shift to function-driven crypto.

According to a report by the Wall Street Journal (WSJ), which cited people familiar with the matter, the discussion began last year after Binance reached out to allies of Trump to secure a business deal with the family as part of a broader strategy to re-establish its presence in the US. ‚ÄúIt is unclear what form the Trump family stake would take if the deal comes together or whether it would be contingent on a pardon,‚Äù the report stated. However, it added that one possibility under discussion is that the deal could go through World Liberty Financial, a decentralized finance (DeFi) project backed by the Trumps. While the claims have not been confirmed, Steve Witkoff, a longtime associate of former President Trump and his top negotiator in Middle Eastern affairs, has been involved in the discussions. CZ Pushes for Pardon At the same time, Changpeng ‚ÄúCZ‚Äù Zhao, Binance‚Äôs co-founder and former CEO, is also pursuing a pardon from the Trump administration, the report said. In November 2023, CZ pleaded to violating US anti-money laundering laws, specifically the Bank Secrecy Act. According to US prosecutors, he failed to implement an effective AML program at Binance, which allowed ‚Äúmoney to flow to terrorists, cybercriminals, and child abusers through its platform.‚Äù As part of the plea deal, he served a four-month sentence, stepped down as CEO, paid a $50 million fine, and Binance settled for $4.3 billion. While he remains a major shareholder in Binance, he was barred from any direct role in managing or operating the company. A Potential Return to the US? A pardon for CZ would significantly impact Binance‚Äôs ability to operate in the US and strengthen its global business prospects. On the other hand, the Trump family‚Äôs potential stake in Binance.US could provide an opportunity to compete with Coinbase as the US crypto market experiences renewed growth amid a shifting regulatory landscape. Binance has been working on a potential return to the US market following Trump‚Äôs election victory in November. According to reports, the company is open to striking a deal with Trump‚Äôs company to put its legal issues on the country behind.

Specifically, after briefly hitting new all-time highs (ATH) above $109,000, the world‚Äôs premier cryptocurrency retraced significantly. In the year-to-date (YTD) chart, BTC is 11.98% in the red and is changing hands at $82,264. Though the performance has been lackluster, recent developments ‚Äì the 5.84% recovery from March 11 lows near $77,500 to be precise ‚Äì have rekindled some hope that the coin could be positioning for an imminent rally. On the other hand, the performance can also be interpreted as Bitcoin setting up a descending pattern of lower highs followed by lower lows. Seeking clarity in the tumult, Finbold decided to consult Alphabet‚Äôs (NASDAQ: GOOGL ) brand new Gemma 3 model ‚Äì reportedly almost as advanced as DeepSeek despite running on a single GPU ‚Äì on where BTC is likely to stand on Easter 2025. Gemma 3 outlines Bitcoin‚Äôs path to Easter 2025 Unfortunately, given the positioning of the brand-new model, the price prediction it provided, as well as the reasoning behind it, was more reminiscent of outdated artificial intelligence ( AI ) models. Specifically, when determining the bullish factors, Gemma 3 first reached for the post-halving cycle , providing the established assessment that the full impact of the supply shock tends to be seen only months after the event and that it‚Äôll likely be in play by Easter. Post-Halving Cycle: The April 2024 halving will have played out. Historically, the year following a halving has seen substantial price appreciation. The supply shock created by the halving typically takes time to impact the market fully. We‚Äôll be well into that cycle by Easter 2025. The AI also opined that continued exchange-traded fund ( ETF ) growth and adoption are also likely to generate tailwinds, estimated that technological advancements and layer-2 solutions remain bullish, and judged institutional adoption as positive. Gemma 3 marked macroeconomic factors ‚Äì primarily referring to the hopes inflation would be contained and interest rate lowered ‚Äì as potentially giving cause for optimism, and also revealed that regulatory clarity would also drive the price upward. It did mark these last two points as ‚Äòhopefully.‚Äô Gemma 3 also revealed that it continues factoring in the notion that Bitcoin is a safe-haven asset despite BTC‚Äôs price action in the wake of different recent external shocks, including the Iranian missile attack on Israel, heightened inflation, weak job reports, and the escalation of the trade war, all of which did much to damage the ‚Äòdigital gold‚Äô narrative. Gemma 3 describes the bearish factors that could impact Bitcoin When describing the bearish factors, Gemma 3 pointed out ‚Äì either implying possession of insider information or a lack of awareness about the latest election results ‚Äì that a sudden and harsh regulatory crackdown against the industry would prove a major headwind. Similarly, the AI estimated that competition from the other cryptocurrencies, security breaches, or a greater economic recession could drive BTC lower. Finalizing the assessment, Gemma 3 concluded that black swan events could also be bearish and explained that a protracted sell-off is likewise likely to put downward pressure on Bitcoin. Gemma 3 sets Bitcoin price target for Easter Lastly, having analyzed Bitcoin‚Äôs position in March 2025, Gemma 3 explained that the cryptocurrency is likely to trade somewhere between $85,000 and $150,000 on Easter. $85,000: This represents a conservative estimate, accounting for potential setbacks and a slower-than-expected adoption rate. It‚Äôs a reasonable floor given the historical post-halving performance. $150,000: This reflects a more optimistic scenario, where the bullish factors dominate and Bitcoin continues to gain mainstream acceptance. It‚Äôs achievable if ETF inflows remain strong and institutional adoption accelerates. It also factors in the potential for a significant macroeconomic tailwind.

Its stability and focus on decentralized computing have made it a consistent choice for many crypto investors. However, as the DeFi sector surges with innovation, ETC‚Äôs slower ecosystem growth has investors seeking opportunities elsewhere to diversify their portfolios and ride the wave of decentralized finance. This trend is bringing attention to BinoFi (BINO), a project positioned to redefine how DeFi and trading work. For ETC holders, BinoFi not only provides diversification but also represents a chance to be part of a rapidly growing ecosystem tailored to tomorrow‚Äôs decentralized infrastructure. What Makes BinoFi Stand Out? BinoFi is lighting its path in the DeFi space by being the first hybrid cryptocurrency exchange. It combines the high-speed execution of centralized exchanges (CEXs) with the security and transparency of decentralized exchanges (DEXs). This hybrid model is particularly compelling for traders who‚Äôve struggled to balance liquidity with control over their assets. At the core of BinoFi‚Äôs value lies its direct cross-chain trading protocol, which enables seamless multi-chain transactions without relying on risky bridges or wrapped tokens. For ETC holders, this means they can easily tap into other blockchain ecosystems without the technical friction or costs often associated with cross-chain trades. Additionally, BinoFi's Multi-Party Computation (MPC) wallets ensure security without the need for traditional seed phrases. This non-custodial system simplifies asset management and lets users enjoy smooth, stress-free trading. The added bonus? Gasless transactions, which cut expenses for traders and make DeFi participation significantly more cost-effective. Capitalizing on the Anticipated DeFi Boom Decentralized finance continues to grow at a breakneck pace, with projects innovating in yield farming, staking, lending, and liquidity management. BinoFi stands out in this space by offering more than just a trading platform. Its roadmap includes a Trade-to-Earn model, social trading features, and DeFi integrations such as staking and yield farming incentives. BinoFi‚Äôs ecosystem is designed to attract both institutional players and everyday users by combining user-first tools with advanced trading options like AI-driven automation and automated liquidity routing. This scalability and versatility make it uniquely positioned to capitalize on the expected DeFi boom and provide its users with long-term value. For ETC holders, whose primary asset has limited DeFi involvement, BinoFi presents an enticing opportunity to gain exposure to this high-growth sector without abandoning their core principles of decentralization and transparency. Why ETC Holders Are Turning to BinoFi ETC investors are known for valuing reliability and strong project fundamentals. With its ambitious, DeFi-focused roadmap and cutting-edge features, BinoFi meets these criteria while also offering explosive growth potential. Its early adoption phase means that ETC holders can become part of the story before the project reaches widespread awareness. Another key attraction is BinoFi‚Äôs commitment to creating an ecosystem that offers more than just financial returns. Its focus on innovations like Zero-Knowledge (ZK) KYC, which ensures regulatory compliance while preserving user privacy, and its future plans to transition into a DAO align well with the values of decentralization and inclusivity. Insights for Investors The rise of DeFi offers substantial opportunities, but picking the right project is critical. For investors tied to Ethereum Classic or any single-asset portfolio, BinoFi provides a strategic entry point into the decentralized finance space. Its focus on utility, user rewards, and next-gen trading tools presents a clear path for sustained growth. The cryptocurrency market evolves quickly, and the early movers often stand to gain the most.

Dogecoin (DOGE), which once gained prominence as a meme coin, has garnered significant attention from both retail investors and whales alike. However, Dogecoin investors are increasingly eyeing Coldware (COLD) as a promising new platform to utilize their DOGE holdings and further increase their profits through decentralized finance (DeFi) solutions. Why Coldware (COLD) Is Attracting Dogecoin Investors Coldware (COLD) is revolutionizing decentralized finance by focusing on mobile-first solutions, making DeFi accessible to a broader audience. As the blockchain space becomes more complex, the need for user-friendly solutions has never been more critical. Coldware (COLD) offers a simple yet innovative way for users to engage with DeFi applications, including staking, yield farming, and decentralized exchanges (DEXs), all from their mobile devices. This accessibility is attracting Dogecoin investors looking for ways to increase the value of their DOGE holdings while exploring the DeFi space. Many Dogecoin holders have witnessed the growth of their investments over the years, but as the market matures, they are now looking for new opportunities to leverage their holdings. Coldware (COLD) provides a platform that allows these investors to unlock the potential of their DOGE tokens within the decentralized finance ecosystem. With Coldware‚Äôs PayFi system, DOGE investors can utilize their holdings for staking and other DeFi activities, which could lead to substantial returns. The Power of Coldware‚Äôs PayFi & DeFi Solutions Coldware (COLD) is positioning itself as a significant player in the DeFi space with its PayFi and mobile-first solutions. PayFi allows users to seamlessly stake their tokens, including DOGE, and earn rewards through decentralized protocols. This is a game-changer for Dogecoin investors who have been holding their tokens for long periods and are looking for ways to maximize their profits without relying on centralized exchanges. Additionally, Coldware (COLD) is focused on providing a range of decentralized services, from trading on DEXs to accessing liquidity pools, all while ensuring ease of use and security on mobile devices. For Dogecoin holders who are looking to diversify their portfolio and explore new ways to grow their investments, Coldware (COLD)‚Äôs PayFi and DeFi solutions present an attractive and user-friendly option. Coldware‚Äôs $1.5M Presale Success Signals Growth Potential Coldware‚Äôs presale success speaks volumes about its potential to disrupt the crypto space. With $1.5M raised already, Coldware (COLD) has managed to generate significant interest from the cryptocurrency community. The project‚Äôs focus on providing decentralized finance solutions on mobile devices has caught the attention of both retail and institutional investors.

Coldware (COLD) is filling that gap, offering Dogecoin investors a way to utilize their holdings in a more profitable way. Looking Ahead: What‚Äôs Next for Dogecoin and Coldware? As Dogecoin continues to face challenges with its stagnant price movement and reliance on community-driven hype, Coldware (COLD) is emerging as a significant contender in the DeFi space. Investors who are looking for the next big opportunity are increasingly turning to Coldware for its innovative mobile-first platform and its ability to bring DeFi to the masses. With the success of its $1.5M presale, Coldware (COLD) is positioning itself for explosive growth.

Investors are on their heels, running to cover themselves from the losses supposedly caused by President Donald Trump‚Äôs aggressive trade policies. Yet, their cries are nowhere near enough to stop Trump from playing a high-stakes game of pause and play with tariffs. Some economists are cautioning consumers that the US is teetering on the edge of a recession and inflation. But the current administration says all the talk, even if it dawns on reality, counts for nought point nought. US Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick believes an economic downturn would be a small price to pay for Making America Great Again. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent sees the slowdown as a necessary ‚Äúdetox.‚Äù President Trump himself insists the economy is simply in a period of ‚Äútransition.‚Äù So, who do we listen to? Well, it‚Äôs much better to wait and see. Recession or brighter days ahead? Historically, economic downturns have provided rare equal-opportunity events for the stock markets. But during those times, the country was about 70% sure of what was going to happen in months, even years, arguably. In the Trump 2.0 era, making predictions is almost akin to a fool‚Äôs errand. In layperson‚Äôs terms, a recession is an economic situation in which a country‚Äôs total output, or gross domestic product (GDP), takes a meaningful nosedive. By the ‚Äúrule of thumb,‚Äù two consecutive quarters of GDP contraction is an outright recession. Thankfully, we are not there yet, largely because American consumers are still spending, and businesses, though frightened about the red flashes in the equities market, have not fully pulled back their investments. But you would be naive not to see the cracks forming, also owing to the fact that economists are slashing their 2025 growth projections. If Trump follows through on his latest round of tariff threats, then we could see the economy finally tip over the edge in the coming months, if not weeks. Tariffs are a dangerous game, even for President Trump Donald Trump is as stubborn as wealthy businessmen come, and the White House is moving ahead with tariffs on a range of imports. What does that mean? Consumer prices will shoot up, and day-to-day spenders, alongside businesses, will choose to keep their funds or spend them somewhere else entirely. According to the National Bureau of Economic Research (NBER), which determines when recessions begin and end, GDP is not the only measure of recession. The forum also watches unemployment, personal income (excluding government benefits), consumer spending, and industrial production. A slow erosion across each of these metrics translates to a prolonged economic malaise, even if the government will say that it is technically not a recession . The economy could nosedive, much like it did in 2020 during the COVID-19 pandemic or in 2016 when growth stagnated, but nobody coined any of the situations as a formal recession. At the start of the year, a recession was considered unlikely; we have the post-November elections market rally to thank for that. Unemployment was low, wages were rising, and inflation was easing back toward the Federal Reserve‚Äôs 2% target. The Fed had even cut interest rates by a full percentage point since September as they looked forward to a ‚Äúsoft landing‚Äù from the inflationary spike of 2021-2022. Yet, it all seems to have come half circle; nobody is smiling when the words Trump markets are mentioned. All the gains investors had counted back then have all been wiped out . If the economy is on the brink of collapsing, what are tariffs for? Until recently, many had assumed Trump was using tariffs as leverage, threats designed to force the hand of foreign governments to address issues affecting America, like illegal immigration and drug trafficking. We believed that once he got the assurance of Canada and Mexico‚Äôs support, he would back down. Safe to say perception is not reality, and Trump is convinced that he is really doing right by America. In a Sunday interview with Fox‚Äôs Sunday Morning Futures , Trump was asked about the possibility of a recession. ‚ÄúI hate to predict things like that,‚Äù he said before adding, ‚ÄúThere is a period of transition because what we‚Äôre doing is very big.‚Äù This ‚Äúbig‚Äù shift, as Trump describes it, is to bring manufacturing back to the US. But how much economic pain will Americans endure before that vision turns real? His heart may very well be in the right place, but that doesn‚Äôt stop the market bloodbath situation we are in now. Economists like Jonathan Millar, a senior economist at Barclays, were fully convinced the administration would retreat if markets suffered. Now, he isn‚Äôt so sure. ‚Äú We‚Äôre putting more weight on the possibility they wouldn‚Äôt, ‚Äù he said. ‚Äú We‚Äôre seeing a real change in rhetoric .‚Äù Markets whiplash on ‚Äòtrade war‚Äô threats According to CNBC, stock futures tumbled Thursday morning after Trump took to Truth Social to announce potential 200% tariffs on all alcoholic products from the European Union. The move was a direct retaliation against the EU‚Äôs 50% tariff on American whiskey and bourbon. ‚Äú This will be great for the Wine and Champagne businesses in the US ,‚Äù Trump wrote. As of 9:30 AM ET, futures tied to the S&P 500 had dropped by 0.2%, while Dow Jones futures shed 71 points. The Nasdaq dipped 0.4%, reversing the previous day‚Äôs gains garnered by two-day price surges by tech stocks like Nvidia and Palantir Technologies. Investors may have a glimmer of hope in the name of better-than-expected inflation data. February‚Äôs producer price index, a measure of inflationary pressure, came in flat, contrary to expectations of an increase. Still, not many people on Wall Street are not convinced the current positives will be present for the long term. President Trump is not listening to anyone; he even wants Canada to become a part of the US, something the Canadian government will obviously be opposed to. And what will be his answer? Tariffs. Will it work in the end? Depends on who you ask. But investors aren‚Äôt buying the long game, they‚Äôre feeling the pain now.",OP-ED|Dow Jones|S&P 500,EN,0,0,MARKET|BUSINESS|REGULATION|TRADING|FIAT,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-03-13 15:55:02

Mutuum Finance (MUTM), currently priced at just $0.02, is emerging as a strong contender with real utility in DeFi and rising market demand. As its presale gains momentum, analysts predict that MUTM‚Äôs growth potential could surpass ADA‚Äôs performance in the coming months, making it a project worth watching closely. Cardano (ADA) Cardano (ADA) is a blockchain platform known for its scalability, security, and energy-efficient proof-of-stake consensus. It supports smart contracts and decentralized applications (dApps), positioning itself as a strong competitor in the blockchain space. Despite its steady development and institutional interest, ADA‚Äôs price movements have remained relatively slow compared to emerging projects. With its rapidly growing presale and real utility in DeFi, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is poised to outperform ADA in the coming months, offering higher growth potential for early investors. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is a decentralized lending and borrowing platform designed to provide users with passive income opportunities while maintaining full control over their assets. Unlike traditional lending systems, where intermediaries dictate terms, Mutuum Finance operates through smart contracts, ensuring transparency, security, and efficiency. Users can supply assets to earn interest or borrow against their holdings without selling, making it a valuable tool for investors looking to access liquidity without sacrificing long-term growth potential. To further enhance security and transparency, the Mutuum Finance team is in the process of securing an audit from Certik, one of the most respected blockchain security firms. This audit will thoroughly review the platform‚Äôs smart contracts, ensuring they meet the highest standards for reliability and protection against vulnerabilities. Once completed, the official results will be announced on Mutuum Finance‚Äôs social media channels, reinforcing investor confidence and strengthening the project‚Äôs long-term credibility. Why MUTM Could Outperform Cardano While Cardano (ADA) has strong technology and adoption, its price growth has remained relatively slow, with many investors searching for faster-growing alternatives in the market. Mutuum Finance, still in its early stages, offers a unique advantage‚Äîit is priced at just $0.02 in presale, providing significant upside potential as it moves toward launch. Additionally, Mutuum‚Äôs buy-and-distribute mechanism continuously supports market demand, increasing buy pressure as platform fees are used to repurchase MUTM and reward stakers. This sustainable model could lead to a steady and long-term price increase, making it a compelling choice for investors seeking growth. Mutuum Finance‚Äôs presale success has already demonstrated strong investor confidence. The project has raised over $3.2 million, with more than 5,400 holders securing their tokens early. Currently in Phase 3, the token remains at $0.02, but as the presale progresses, the price is set to increase with each new phase. By the time MUTM reaches exchange listings, its launch price will be set at $0.06, offering early investors an immediate 3x return. However, many analysts believe this is just the beginning. As Mutuum‚Äôs lending protocol goes live alongside the token launch, the real demand for MUTM is expected to surge, pushing its price higher. With growing adoption and long-term expansion, it has the potential to reach $1.50 over time as the platform establishes itself in the DeFi sector. For example, an investor purchasing 120,000 MUTM tokens at the current presale price of $0.02 would make an initial investment of $2,400. By the time MUTM reaches its launch price of $0.06, that investment would be worth $7,200, delivering a 3x return. When the token continues its projected growth and reaches $1.50 in the long term, those 120,000 tokens would be valued at $180,000, marking a massive increase for early investors who secured their positions at the lowest price. With its real DeFi utility, increasing adoption, and strong investor backing, Mutuum Finance is quickly becoming a top choice for those looking for high-growth investments. As ADA struggles to gain momentum, MUTM‚Äôs rapid progress and unique financial model make it a strong contender to outperform Cardano in Q2 2025.

This could potentially accelerate the SOL price sell-off in the near term for a drop below $100 for the first time since February 2024. Solana‚Äôs 1-day chart. Source: Cointelegraph/TradingView A death cross occurs when a bearish crossover occurs between the 50-day and 200-day simple moving averages (SMAs), with the long-term indicator above the short-term indicator. Last month, the 50-day and 200-day exponential moving averages (EMAs) triggered a death cross on Solana‚Äôs one-day chart, after which prices dropped 17%, from $137 to $122. While the SMA and EMA death crosses carry similar implications, the EMA triggers the death cross faster since it responds more quickly to price changes. A double death cross from the SMA and EMA will likely increase the possibility of a correction. Historically, the odds are neutral for Solana. Since its inception, SOL‚Äôs price has witnessed a death cross three times (including 2025) when prices have been on a 90-day or higher downtrend. The first death cross in 2022 triggered a 90% collapse, but the FTX‚Äôs fiasco escalated its severity. The second death cross occurred in September 2024, but it reversed within a month, leading to the Trump rally. Related: 3 reasons why Ethereum can outperform its rivals after crashing to 17-month lows Yet, the current structure and sentiment mirror the 2022 death cross when we compare market conditions. On both occasions, a new all-time high preceded the downtrend, which led to the death cross. As Cointelegraph reported , Solana‚Äôs revenue dropped 93% since January, dropping from $238 million to $32 million. This indicates a current lack of activity on Solana‚Äôs network after the end of the memecoin frenzy. Can Solana traders defend $125? Based on its technicals, Solana remains in a tricky spot when comparing previous death cross returns and collective market sentiment. Solana must hold support between $125 and $110 for a bullish reversal. Since March 2024, SOL prices have rebounded six times after testing the support range, closing above $125 on each weekly retest. Solana 1-week chart. Source: Cointelegraph/TradingView A weekly close below $125 will signal market weakness, potentially increasing the likelihood of a drop below $100. The immediate price target after $110 is around $80 for Solana, which is a significant 30% correction. The downtrend target carries confluence with the weekly 0.5 Fibonacci retracement line. Solana bullish divergences on the 1-day and 4-hour chart. Source: Cointelegraph/TradingView However, the bulls will pin their hopes on a bullish divergence between the price and relative strength index (RSI) on the 1-day and 4-hour charts. If Solana manages to avoid another lower low, the divergences will remain valid, which can push prices higher above $125, enabling Solana to avoid a drop below $100 and possibly establish a bottom at $112.

This has left analysts split on a realistic Ripple price prediction for 2025, though the assets market cap still stands at a sizable $126 billion. Ripple has also been facing fierce competition from a new rival, Remittix (RTX). This PayFichallenger is addressing issues in the global payments space, ironing out the usual inefficiencies that we have come to expect from traditional payment systems. So, how are these two projects likely to stack up against each other in Q2 and beyond as the payment narrative continues to boom? XRP Rocked By Network Outages and Price Woes Ripple has found itself in murky waters lately. Just last month, the XRP Ledger (XRPL) experienced a major outage which halted the network‚Äôs block production for more than an hour . This disruptive outage has called into question Ripple‚Äôs network resilience and resulted in an immediate dip in the native token‚Äôs value. Price-wise, XRP hasn't been faring much better. After a significant rally earlier this year, it's now trading around $2.19 , marking a 10.6% drop over the course of the last month. Analysts are concerned that XRP might underperform the market in 2025, with investors potentially shifting their focus to newer cryptocurrencies. ‚Äã Its success will likely hinge on a resolution with the SEC in relation to Ripple‚Äôs ongoing legal battle, and the performance of Ripple‚Äôs new stablecoin, RLUSD. Remittix Streamlines Global Payments For all the talk about crypto replacing traditional banking, the truth is, spending digital assets is still more difficult than it should be. Whether it‚Äôs waiting days for withdrawals, dealing with expensive fees, or facing restrictions from banks, crypto has struggled to break into everyday transactions. That‚Äôs where Remittix (RTX) is making a difference. By enabling instant crypto-to-FIAT conversions with direct bank transfers on more than 40 cryptocurrencies. Remittix is finally making digital assets usable for real-world spending. Take Josh - a Philippine based remote worker. He takes payment from his international clients in various stablecoins but he needs Philippine Pesos to pay his rent and daily expenses. With traditional exchanges, he would have to wait for days in order to cash out and lose money in conversion fees. With Remittix, Josh can convert his earnings instantly and have them sent directly to his bank account, avoiding any unneeded stress and worry (and fees). Investors Are Moving Quickly as Remittix Gains Traction With a fixed supply of 1.5 billion RTX tokens, demand is expected to increase as adoption grows, making RTX a strong asset in the digital payments sector. Unlike speculative crypto projects, Remittix has a clear real-world function, making it an investment with long-term value. The presale has already soared past $13.8 million, with tokens up for grabs to proactive investors for just $0.0734 a pop. Analysts expect an explosive 800% price jump within the presale stage, and more growth following the launch. For any savvy investor looking to get in on a market disruptor in its early stages, Remittix is an opportunity that is impossible to pass up on.

Bitcoin: The digital gold shaping the future of money Bitcoin is the first and most famous cryptocurrency. Created by someone called Satoshi Nakamoto, it was made to be electronic cash. Unlike regular money, Bitcoin doesn‚Äôt rely on banks. It uses blockchain technology, a shared record of all transactions. Miners verify these transactions by solving puzzles, earning Bitcoins as a reward. This makes the system secure and prevents fraud. Today, Bitcoin is still a strong force in the cryptocurrency world. Only 21 million bitcoins will ever exist, making it scarce like gold. Every four years, miners‚Äô rewards are cut in half, a process called ‚Äúhalving.‚Äù This can affect Bitcoin‚Äôs value and mining profits. While new coins emerge, Bitcoin‚Äôs long history and wide acceptance make it attractive. In the current market, with more interest in digital money, Bitcoin‚Äôs potential is significant. It continues to shape how we think about money. Ethereum‚Äôs evolution: Pioneering the future of decentralized finance Ethereum is a game-changing blockchain platform that introduced the world to smart contracts and decentralized applications (dApps). Launched in 2015 by Vitalik Buterin, it has become the backbone of decentralized finance (DeFi), enabling a vast ecosystem that goes beyond simple transactions. With its shift to Proof-of-Stake in 2022 through an upgrade known as the Merge, Ethereum improved its energy efficiency and set the stage for future enhancements like sharding. This upcoming phase aims to boost scalability and reduce costs, reinforcing Ethereum‚Äôs commitment to innovation. Ether, the native cryptocurrency of Ethereum, is central to this dynamic ecosystem. It powers transactions, rewards those who support the network through staking, and serves as a valuable asset and collateral. In the current market cycle, Ethereum‚Äôs advancements make it a strong contender in the crypto space. Layer 2 solutions like Arbitrum and Polygon enhance transaction efficiency, addressing previous scalability challenges. Compared to other cryptocurrencies, Ethereum‚Äôs robust technology and active development community position it well for future growth. As the blockchain landscape evolves, Ethereum continues to lead with its focus on decentralization and efficiency, making it an attractive option for those interested in the future of digital finance.

While Ethereum and Pi dominate conversations, the real opportunity lies in BitLemons‚Äîa rapidly growing casino ecosystem already delivering value. Investors looking for strong fundamentals, revenue-sharing, and high-growth potential should pay close attention before the next price surge. BitLemons ($BLEM) is Defying Market Trends BitLemons is not just another presale token‚Äîit is a fully operational crypto casino generating real-time revenue. With over 8,000 games, a deflationary token model, and a staking system paying out real profits, BLEM stands apart from projects still in development. Unlike traditional gambling platforms, Bitlemons is fully integrated with crypto, ensuring decentralization, transparency, and a global reach. The platform has already raised over $1.9 million, with Stage 2 nearly sold out and Stage 3 pushing the price to $0.03 in the next few days. Momentum is building fast as celebrity and influencer partnerships gain traction, drawing new users into the ecosystem. Investors note that BitLemons has a proven business model rather than speculative promises. The casino generates revenue, with 30% of Gross Gaming Revenue (GGR) distributed to token holders through buybacks, burns, and staking rewards. This creates sustainable long-term growth while keeping supply deflationary, making $BLEM a high-value asset in a market flooded with unproven projects. Ethereum (ETH) Faces Whale-Induced Volatility Ethereum continues to be the most dominant smart contract platform, despite recent market volatility triggered by a notable whale transaction of $13 million to Kraken. Investors are closely monitoring key support levels around $1,500 and the critical resistance point at $1,800, which could determine the cryptocurrency‚Äôs near-term market trajectory. The network‚Äôs ongoing upgrades and continued importance in DeFi, NFTs, and Layer-2 scaling solutions maintain its strong institutional interest. However, short-term volatility has created uncertainty among traders and investors seeking stable growth opportunities. Pi Network (PI) Prepares for Market Entry Pi Network stands at a critical juncture with its upcoming mainnet launch, potentially transitioning from a speculative project to a real-world adopted cryptocurrency. The unique mobile mining model has attracted millions of users worldwide, generating significant anticipation about its future market performance. The primary questions surrounding Pi Network revolve around potential exchange listings and its ability to maintain user engagement beyond the initial launch. While the project shows promise, it still faces challenges in establishing a concrete market value and competing with established blockchain platforms. Why BitLemons ($BLEM) is the Smarter Play Ethereum‚Äôs market dominance remains unchallenged, but whale movements and resistance levels create uncertainty. Pi Network‚Äôs launch is highly anticipated, but the lack of a trading market makes its future unpredictable. In contrast, BitLemons is already generating revenue, rewarding investors through a proven casino ecosystem that continues to expand. The combination of actual earnings, strong tokenomics, and rapid adoption positions BLEM as one of the best investment opportunities in the crypto market today. With Stage 2 nearly sold out, now is the time to get in before the next price increase and ride the wave of exponential growth.

Some experts believe the coins are capable of yielding 1500% gains by April. Nowadays, investor interest lies in knowing whose token will be leading the next boom. Remittixwith real-world use case circumstances is one of the best cryptos to invest in, according to most. Its stable DeFi coin value is extremely attractive for early adopters. Solana: A Mature Token Facing New Choices Solana has built a strong reputation for fast transfers and low fees. Recent reports show that SOL now faces increased competition. Many traders see that the Solana price has moved sideways this year. While SOL still powers many dApps, investors now look at its long-term role. Some discussions around the SOL Price remind us that even older tokens are not immune to market changes. Technical upgrades on Solana keep the network strong, but market shifts push investors to seek alternatives. As pressure mounts, many note that SOL may not deliver the explosive gains seen in earlier days. The current sentiment is that it will only rise by about 10.27% and reach $137.15 by April 11. Pi Network: A Community-Driven Experiment Pi Network began as a project intended to make crypto accessible to the common man. It is designed to allow users to mine tokens for fun. Since its launch, it has been disobeying market fluctuations and has remained firm regardless of the recent market slump. However, there are some concerns regarding how far its tech can go. Some have drawn parallels with Solana and have concluded it will be ahead of the top-performing altcoin by April. Pi Network is likely to increase by 225.35% to $5.35 by April 11. Despite its engaged community, Pi Network must prove its capability to generate profits in the very competitive arena for the longer term. Remittix: A New DeFi Project Solving Real-World Payment Problems Remittix is the end-to-end solution for cross-border remittances which are time-consuming and costly. It's a PayFi platform removing multiple redundant steps from the traditional bank. This makes money transfer economical and speedy. Remittix not just guarantees better returns. It brings into the new world of banking and finance the very essence of cryptography‚Äîusers' identity and control protection. A majority of the world lacks a bank account. Over 1.4 billion are known not to possess a bank account. The same person can receive crypto into a wallet, send it through Remittix into the local agent's office, and get cash for daily expenses. This process offers them the freedom of digital money with the convenience of cash. It is just such everyday solutions that make Remittix different from price-based tokens. Remittix hit 518 million token sales during its ICO. Its value as a DeFi token is now standing at around $0.0734, which is within the viable price for new and current investors. Remittix could increase as much as 1500% with increased usage, as experts predict. One of the reasons why it is greatly advised by most experts as one of the most viable cryptos to invest in is the fact that it can seamlessly and conveniently bridge the gap between crypto and fiat. The platform actually sets forth a solution for cross-border payment sluggishness and excessive fees. With the increasing users looking for faster payment avenues, Remittix does find itself well positioned as the entrance point for mainstream crypto adoption.

Rapid market interest creates a rapidly closing period for Mutuum Finance (MUTM) investors who seek to take advantage of Phase 3 tokens. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Presale Momentum Builds The interest in Mutuum Finance (MUTM) grows stronger because its Phase 3 allocations are rapidly running out. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has attracted investors who want to leverage decentralized lending services because it provides crypto market utility.

Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has shown potential to reach the estimated value of $3.50 in 2025 based on the performance of its lending platform.

What‚Äôs Next for Mutuum Finance Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Phase 3‚Äôs fast-paced adoption indicates increased excitement about the upcoming project targets. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) plans to enhance its utility by releasing peer-to-peer lending features together with an overcollateralized stablecoin before launch. Security third-party audits provide additional investor confidence and the adjustable interest rates support borrowers who seek high yields together with risk-averse lenders. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) exchange listings approaching will drive up the token‚Äôs purchasing demand through its deflationary active redistribution system.

Numerous analysts acknowledge that ADA‚Äôs upcoming significant price shift will emerge within the crucial $0.80 to $0.66 price range. pdojafutures.com veteran Simpson recently predicted $36 for Cardano but experts remain unconvinced due to weakening technical metrics and a daily market loss of 5%. Investors have focused their attention on decentralised lending protocol Mutuum Finance (MUTM) as this project reaches Phase 3 in its presale phase and secures $3.1 million alongside 5,300 holders. MUTM exists as a substantial competitive threat to Cardano because of its systemized tokenomics design and 200% token price appreciation from presale phase 3 to listing. Cardano‚Äôs Precarious Position The 15% drop in Cardano during the week resembles a systemic market devaluation that has pushed Bitcoin to $82,000 and Ethereum almost to $2,000. Based on negative values of the Moving Average Convergence Divergence indicator traders expect further market deterioration. ADA approaches oversold zones according to 4-hour chart RSI metrics which show 36 but requires both ETF adoption and uncertain bullish triggers to recover. The Simpson prophecy maintains its curiosity but does not align with current conditions which require ADA to restore $0.80 for achieving upward trends. The market demands new investments that show promising growth potential while investors currently shift toward such opportunities. Mutuum Finance‚Äôs Presale Acceleration The phase 3 presale of Mutuum Finance (MUTM) attracts DeFi users who seek utility tokens because of its fast rising token demand at $0.02 per token. The project assures MUTM demand sustainability through its lending model that combines mtTokens for yielding deposits and secured lending with excess collateral. Stage 4 investors participating early will receive a 25% gain after Phase 4 launches at $0.025 before the final $0.06 listing price provides a total profit of 200%. The token value is expected to rise to $3.50 following the launch according to analysts because revenue-generating token redistribution will create substantial purchase activity. Every day decreases the availability of first purchase opportunities because 5,300 individuals have already obtained the token. Dynamic interest rates connected with peer-to-peer lending define the operational stability of Mutuum Finance against speculative assets. The buy-and-distribute system of the platform uses platform revenue to buy back MUTM tokens which rewards stakers while preventing token sell-off. The $100,000 pre-sale give-away program together with this mechanism supports permanent token holder retention. The transparent tokenomics and the development fund of MUTM creates conditions for mass adoption because traditional DeFi platforms experience volatility issues. Seizing the Moment Mutuum Finance delivers concrete earning opportunities through its structured presale program despite the unpredictable technical indicators and celebrity news impact on Cardano‚Äôs future direction. The entry level of Phase 3 at $0.02 marks a short opportunity for users to benefit from projected algorithmic gains before the project lists on exchanges. MUTM attracts investors who left ADA because of its price volatility by offering an anticipated 17,400% growth and operational functionality in the real world. The crypto market stability depends on Mutuum Finance delivering its strategic distribution plan and yield-generating protocols. The deadline for presale success is now crucial because investors wish to achieve maximum profits before MUTM‚Äôs launch. Participating in Phase 3 before its capacity limit decreases becomes crucial to capitalize on anticipated $3.50 post-launch value which can fade into the past if investors delay action. Mutuum Finance leads ADA by setting new DeFi investment standards through its operations.

This case isn‚Äôt just about high-value tech; it‚Äôs a complex web involving alleged fraud, US export restrictions, and the insatiable demand for advanced chips in China‚Äôs burgeoning AI industry. Let‚Äôs dive into the details of this unfolding drama and understand its potential ripple effects across the global tech landscape. Singapore Chip Fraud: Unpacking the Allegations What exactly is this Singapore chip fraud case all about? At its core, it revolves around accusations that three men allegedly deceived suppliers like Dell and Super Micro, misrepresenting the final destination of server computers. These servers, prosecutors believe, were intended for countries under US export restrictions, potentially including organizations in China. The alleged scheme involved moving servers through Malaysia, with transactions reaching a staggering $390 million, according to reports. Here‚Äôs a breakdown of the key allegations: **Deception:** The accused allegedly provided false information to suppliers about the servers‚Äô locations. **Circumvention of US Export Restrictions:** The servers are suspected to contain Nvidia chips subject to US export controls aimed at preventing their use in certain countries, particularly China. **Financial Scale:** The transactions under scrutiny amount to approximately $390 million, highlighting the scale of the alleged fraud. **Geographic Scope:** The operation spans across Singapore, Malaysia, and potentially China, indicating an international dimension to the alleged crime. Why the Focus on US Export Restrictions? The mention of US export restrictions is crucial. The United States has implemented regulations to control the export of advanced technologies, including high-performance computing chips like those from Nvidia, to specific countries due to national security concerns. These restrictions are primarily aimed at preventing these technologies from being used to advance military capabilities or for other purposes deemed contrary to US interests. Nvidia, a leading manufacturer of GPUs essential for AI and data centers, has been directly impacted by these restrictions. Their latest annual report reveals that while Singapore accounts for a significant 18% of their revenue, actual shipments to the country are less than 2% of sales. This disparity raises questions about where these chips are ultimately ending up, fueling speculation about potential re-exportation to restricted regions. The China AI Chips Demand and DeepSeek Connection China‚Äôs rapid advancements in artificial intelligence have created an enormous demand for high-powered chips. Companies like DeepSeek, a Chinese AI firm that gained global attention in January for its cutting-edge technology, are heavily reliant on these chips. Despite US export restrictions , there are concerns about how and where DeepSeek and other Chinese AI companies are sourcing the necessary hardware to power their AI innovations. DeepSeek‚Äôs AI, notably, is powered by Nvidia chips, making the alleged smuggling operation particularly relevant in this context. This situation underscores the delicate balance between technological innovation, national security, and international trade regulations. The demand for AI chips is only expected to grow, and the measures taken to control their distribution will continue to be a focal point in global tech policy. Bail Granted: What‚Äôs Next in the Nvidia Chip Smuggling Case? Despite the gravity of the charges, a Singapore judge granted bail to the three suspects. The bail amounts are substantial ‚Äì S$800,000 and S$600,000 for the two Singaporean men, and S$1 million for the Chinese national. These high bail amounts reflect the seriousness of the allegations and the potential flight risk. Key conditions attached to the bail include: **Travel Restrictions:** The men are barred from airports and border checkpoints, preventing them from leaving Singapore. **Communication Restrictions:** They are prohibited from discussing the case, likely to prevent collusion or obstruction of justice. **Electronic Monitoring:** The Chinese national is reportedly required to wear an electronic monitoring device, ensuring stricter surveillance. The next court hearing is scheduled for May 2nd, and prosecutors have requested an eight-week delay to complete their investigations. This extended timeline suggests the complexity of the case and the extensive evidence that needs to be gathered and analyzed. The investigation is likely to delve into financial records, shipping manifests, communication logs, and potentially involve international cooperation to trace the flow of servers and chips. Malaysia‚Äôs Role and Regional Implications of GPU Smuggling Malaysia‚Äôs involvement adds another layer of complexity to this GPU smuggling saga. Servers allegedly passed through Malaysia after originating from Singaporean companies. The Malaysian government has stated it will take ‚Äúnecessary action‚Äù against any Malaysian companies implicated in the alleged transfer of Nvidia chips. This indicates a regional effort to clamp down on illicit chip trafficking and uphold international trade regulations. The case highlights several critical implications for the region: **Supply Chain Vulnerabilities:** It exposes potential weaknesses in the global technology supply chain, particularly in the monitoring and enforcement of export controls. **Geopolitical Tensions:** The involvement of China and the US export restrictions underscores the ongoing geopolitical tensions surrounding technology and trade. **Regulatory Scrutiny:** Expect increased scrutiny on technology exports and stricter enforcement of regulations in Singapore, Malaysia, and other tech hubs in Asia. **Business Risks:** Companies involved in the technology supply chain need to be increasingly vigilant about compliance and due diligence to avoid inadvertently becoming entangled in illicit activities. The Singapore Nvidia chip smuggling case is far from over. As investigations continue and the court proceedings unfold, the tech industry will be watching closely for further developments and the ultimate outcome. This case serves as a stark reminder of the high stakes involved in the global chip race and the lengths some may go to acquire cutting-edge technology, even in the face of international regulations.

With the investor community seeking the leading meme coins with which to invest their money, the question remains: which one of these coins possesses the most potential for returns within the longer term? As these meme coins are gaining traction, another new venture‚Äî Remittix (RTX) ‚Äîis showing how ease-of-use in the real world might be the way towards sustained expansion. The following is a closer look at the current standing of the top-performing meme coins and how well-suited they are as the top meme coins for investment currently. PEPE: Can It Maintain Its Momentum? PEPE is up 11.67% within the last 24 hours and currently trades at $0.056439 with a capitalization value of $2.7 billion. Despite the strong price appreciation, the trading volume dropped by 1.74%, which may be a signal of waning investor interest. Source: Tradingview PEPE became popular through hype and community backing but remains doubtful with regards to sustainability. It may remain one of the leading meme coins to buy with the caveat for retracements if the buying momentum continues. Dogecoin: The Original Meme Coin Still Holding Strong Dogecoin remains the most recognized meme coin with a 7.49% increase to $0.1651 with a capitalization value standing at $24.51 billion. Despite this, the trading volume for DOGE stands 29.77% lower, suggesting momentum may be waning. Source: Tradingview DOGE remained topical because it enjoyed a wide base and constant support by top personalities such as Elon Musk. As the interest in the meme coins rose, DOGE is still one of the top coins to invest now with the increase in mainstream usage. BONK: Solana‚Äôs Meme Coin Making Waves BONK increased 4.44% within the last 24 hours and is trading around $0.00001021 with a market capitalization value of $794.74 million.

If Solana remains strong, BONK could remain a top contender among the top meme coins in which to invest. WIF: Gaining Popularity but Facing Challenges WIF‚Äôs trading volume dropped 20.13%, but this may signal reduced momentum. It rose 2.96% to $0.4458 with a capitalization value of $445.36 million. Source: Tradingview Despite WIF having built a strong base supporter community, the existence of larger-meme coins like PEPE and DOGE ensures its longer-term outlook remains doubtful. High-risk-tolerance investors looking for high-risk, high-reward trades might still consider WIF as one of the best short-term buy opportunities among the meme coins. SHIB: Can Shiba Inu Reignite Its 2021 Hype? Shiba Inu rose by 5.82% to $0.00001203 with a capitalization value of $7.09 billion. The trading volume with the increase is 33.68% lower, which may be a precursor to waning investor interest. Its expansion into the ecosystem, such as Shibarium and DeFi integrations, has helped it stay up-to-date. If the demand for the likes of meme coins remains strong, SHIB may remain one of the top meme coins to invest in, albeit now with stiff competition from new coins. Remittix (RTX): The Practical Alternative To Meme Coins While meme coins remain newsworthy, Remittix (RTX) is causing ripples with its real-world applicability for cross-border trade. It is currently priced at $0.0734 and has raised more than $13.8 million and sold 518 million tokens with strong investor demand. Compared to the hype surrounding the memes, RTX is fixing real-world financial problems with live fee-less crypto-to-fiat conversion. A freelancer based in Asia who receives payment from a European client can directly convert crypto into fiat with the help of RTX without the need for bank lags and exorbitant fees. RTX's PayFi model provides tangible monetary use cases and is thus a good substitute for speculative meme coins. With the demand for blockchain remittances increasing day by day, RTX could be a contender in the digital payment space. Which Is The Best Meme Coin To Buy? These meme coins like PEPE, DOGE, BONK, WIF, and SHIB are risky but highly rewarding. Some will see exponential gains while others will not manage to hold value in the coming time. Those looking for a secure, utility-based venture are looking towards Remittix (RTX) instead. Whereas meme coins rely on community hype, RTX is building a financial platform that may well outlive the speculative tendencies of the meme tokens. RTX is therefore a suitable option for the longer-term investor.

In London, traders are actively searching for Russian debt, particularly Gazprom bonds, which were once untouchable but are now in demand among Middle Eastern family offices. Buyers see a massive opportunity in these deeply discounted assets, expecting them to surge if restrictions are lifted. Financial institutions are also seeing increased interest in the Russian ruble, with money managers being approached about non-deliverable forwards, which is a kind of derivative that lets investors bet on Russia‚Äôs currency without directly holding Russian assets or dealing with sanctioned entities. Evgeny Kogan, a Moscow-based investment banker, reportedly told Bloomberg that demand for Russian securities is rising fast. ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs an aggressive search for securities of Russian issuers around the world,‚Äù Kogan said on Thursday. ‚ÄúInvestors in general are asking how quickly they can enter the Russian market.‚Äù Traders move fast as Russia weighs ceasefire talks Meanwhile, president Vladimir Putin is playing a different game. On Thursday, he publicly backed the US-led ceasefire proposal but refused to sign anything immediately, arguing that the plan needs further negotiation. ‚ÄúThe idea [of a ceasefire] itself is correct and we are certainly supporting it, but there are issues that need to be discussed. I think that we need to talk to our American colleagues and partners. Maybe call President Trump and discuss it together,‚Äù Putin said. The White House-led ceasefire plan, which Kyiv agreed to on Tuesday, includes a 30-day truce that could be extended, and it also calls for prisoner exchanges, the release of civilian detainees, as well as the return of forcibly transferred Ukrainian children. In exchange, Washington has already resumed intelligence-sharing and military aid with Ukraine. But Russia hasn‚Äôt committed to the deal, and key officials in Moscow remain skeptical. Yuri Ushakov, a senior Kremlin aide, said the plan would mostly serve Ukraine‚Äôs military. ‚ÄúThis is nothing else than a temporary respite for the Ukrainian military, nothing more,‚Äù Ushakov said. ‚ÄúWe believe that our goal is still a long-term peaceful settlement, we are striving for this. A peaceful settlement that takes into account the legitimate interests of our country‚Äîour concerns.‚Äù Meanwhile, Trump is pressuring Moscow to accept the truce, warning that rejecting it could be financially devastating. The US president also spoke about slamming tighter sanctions if Putin does not agree. US Secretary of State Marco Rubio said that the ‚Äúball was in Russia‚Äôs court.‚Äù US delegation in Moscow as Russia sets its own terms A US delegation, led by Trump‚Äôs special envoy Steve Witkoff, landed in Moscow on Thursday for ceasefire negotiations, but expectations are low. Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov told reporters on Thursday that talks were happening but downplayed any immediate outcome. ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs not get ahead of ourselves, we‚Äôll tell you later. There have already been contacts,‚Äù Peskov said. Meanwhile, in the past 24 hours, Putin has visited the Kursk region, a key battleground where Russian forces claim they are close to retaking lost territory. The Russian president‚Äôs rare frontline appearance shows that the Kremlin is keeping military pressure on, even while discussing peace. It‚Äôs a classic power move. Russia has also laid out red lines for any future peace deal, but officials in Moscow insist they will not accept the deployment of foreign troops in Ukraine or the construction of Western military bases on Ukrainian soil. Tim Ash, a senior strategist at RBC BlueBay Asset Management, said that Putin is now in a difficult position. ‚ÄúUkraine retook the initiative by appearing as the willing partner to a ceasefire deal, and now how is Putin going to play this?‚Äù Ash said to CNBC on Thursday. ‚ÄúIf he fails to agree to a ceasefire, he then is revealed as the malign actor ‚Ä¶ and would risk the wrath of Trump.‚Äù Volodymyr Dubovyk, an analyst at the Center for European Policy Analysis, called the US-Ukraine meeting a potential turning point. ‚ÄúThe question is: a breakthrough towards what exactly? The main questions remain the same as before the agreement. What will Moscow‚Äôs response be? I think that it may play along, pretending that it also wants peace,‚Äù Dubovyk said. Other analysts believe that Washington‚Äôs patience may run out. Sam Greene, a Russia specialist at CEPA, warned that if Moscow refuses to accept the ceasefire, Trump‚Äôs administration may push Ukraine to make additional concessions. ‚ÄúWith immediate Russian acquiescence to a ceasefire unlikely to be forthcoming, the White House‚Äôs frustration may lead to renewed demands for Ukrainian concessions,‚Äù Greene said.

On March 6, 2025, President Donald Trump signed an executive order establishing a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve, starting with 200,000 BTC‚Äîseized from criminal and civil forfeiture cases. Ryan Rasmussen, head of research at Bitwise Asset Management, argues this step, announced amid a Bitcoin market cap of $1.73 trillion, could catalyze a worldwide rush for the asset. His analysis , shared on X on March 7, 2025, suggests a transformative impact on adoption and legitimacy. Let‚Äôs examine the facts driving this development. Strategic Reserve: A $16.6 billion Commitment Trump‚Äôs order, enacted on March 6, 2025, allocates 200,000 BTC to a national reserve. White House crypto czar David Sacks confirmed the funding source: assets confiscated through legal proceedings. ‚ÄúThis incurs no taxpayer expense,‚Äù Sacks stated in a March 6, 2025, briefing, emphasizing fiscal neutrality. The reserve represents 0.95% of Bitcoin‚Äôs 21 million total supply. This is a sizable stake for a known government entity. He contends that the U.S. Bitcoin reserve could prompt other nations to acquire BTC. ‚ÄúThe goal isn‚Äôt U.S. domination of Bitcoin holdings,‚Äù he wrote, ‚Äúbut a signal that forces global action.‚Äù Matt Hougan, Bitwise‚Äôs chief investment officer, echoed this in a March 4, 2025, analysis, noting early adopters like El Salvador (2,381 BTC), Bhutan (undisclosed), and Abu Dhabi (undisclosed). Hougan asked, ‚ÄúIf Honduras or Qatar sees the U.S. and peers move, can they afford to lag?‚Äù per his report. Financial Institutions Poised to Respond The reserve could alter institutional behavior. Rasmussen highlighted that regulatory uncertainty has deterred wealth managers, pension funds, and endowments from Bitcoin. Source: X With the U.S. holding 200,000 BTC, that barrier is weakening. ‚ÄúThis legitimizes Bitcoin as a strategic asset,‚Äù he posted on X. The White House fact sheet from March 6, 2025, authorizes Commerce and Treasury Secretaries to explore additional BTC acquisitions , provided they remain budget-neutral, reinforcing this shift. Rasmussen also addressed a key concern in his post: the risk of a U.S. sell-off destabilizing Bitcoin‚Äôs price. ‚ÄúA reserve makes a ban impossible,‚Äù he wrote, estimating the probability at ‚Äúdefinitively zero.‚Äù The $16.6 billion suggests accumulation, not liquidation . Hougan‚Äôs analysis framed the reserve as a global signal. ‚ÄúThe most critical audience is abroad,‚Äù he wrote, citing nations like Russia and China as potential responders.",Bitcoin|News|Bitcoin News,EN,0,0,BTC|FIAT|MARKET|RESEARCH|REGULATION,"{'name': 'ZyCrypto', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/zycrypto.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",zycrypto,2025-03-13 17:35:09

The charges stemmed from an initial coin offering Andrade conducted for AML Bitcoin in 2017 and 2018. Early court filings covered by CoinDesk alleged Andrade, a Texas resident, falsely told investors that AML Bitcoin tokens would ultimately be converted into a tradeable AML Bitcoin currency ‚Äî a cryptocurrency that never launched and was named to resemble the popular Bitcoin token. The conviction marks the conclusion of one of the first and longest-running crypto ""pump-and-dump"" cases to involve U.S. federal prosecutors. The Department of Justice named famed D.C. lobbyist Jack Abramoff a co-conspirator and he pleaded guilty in 2020 , paying more than $50,000 in disgorgement and interest. Abramoff is better known for his involvement in a federal corruption scandal that resulted in his imprisonment and was depicted in the film ""Casino Jack."" A statement released by the U.S. Department of Justice accused Andrade of diverting ""more than $2 million in proceeds from the sale of AML Bitcoin"" and using it on ""personal expenses, including the purchase of two properties in Texas and two luxury automobiles."" According to the statement, Andrade also falsely claimed that the Panama Canal Authority was close to permitting AML Bitcoin to be used for ships passing through the Panama Canal when no such agreement existed. ""Fraudsters often tout new and innovative technology in order to raise money from investors. But raising money through lies and misrepresentations is neither new nor innovative. It's unlawful, plain and simple,"" said Acting United States Attorney Patrick D. Robbins. ""If you deceive investors to enrich yourself and spend their money on personal expenses, homes, and property, you will be held to account."" Andrade is scheduled to be sentenced in July. According to the DOJ press release, ""he faces a maximum penalty of 20 years in prison for the wire fraud count and 10 years in prison for the money laundering count, and forfeiture of all property that is traceable to his wire fraud and money laundering violations including property that Andrade bought in Texas.""",Policy,EN,0,0,BTC|TOKEN SALE|BUSINESS|SPONSORED|TECHNOLOGY,"{'name': 'CoinDesk', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coindesk.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coindesk,2025-03-13 17:36:04

41601668,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=139871,1741887618,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Revolutionary Move: CBOE BZX Seeks SEC Green Light for In-Kind Redemptions in Bitcoin & Ethereum ETFs,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/sec-approval-crypto-etf-redemptions/,"Exciting news is brewing in the cryptocurrency ETF space! Imagine a world where trading Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs becomes even more efficient and cost-effective for big players. Well, that future might be closer than you think. CBOE BZX Exchange has just taken a significant step by requesting the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to approve a game-changing mechanism for Invesco Galaxy‚Äôs spot Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) ETFs. Let‚Äôs dive into what this ‚Äòin-kind redemption‚Äô fuss is all about and why it could be a massive leap forward for crypto ETFs. Decoding In-Kind Redemptions for Crypto ETFs So, what exactly are in-kind redemptions and why are they so important? In simple terms, it‚Äôs a process that allows institutional investors to redeem their ETF shares by directly exchanging them for the underlying assets ‚Äì in this case, Bitcoin or Ethereum ‚Äì instead of the usual cash equivalent. Think of it as swapping your ETF shares directly for a bag of actual Bitcoin or Ethereum. This method, while common in traditional ETFs, is being proposed for these crypto ETFs to enhance efficiency and reduce costs. Let‚Äôs break down the traditional redemption process versus the proposed in-kind model: Feature Traditional Redemption (Cash) In-Kind Redemption (Proposed) Redemption Method ETF shares exchanged for cash ETF shares exchanged for underlying assets (BTC/ETH) Process ETF provider sells underlying assets, then provides cash to redeeming party. ETF provider directly transfers underlying assets to redeeming party. Efficiency Potentially less efficient due to asset selling and cash transfer steps. More efficient; direct transfer streamlines the process. Cost Can incur transaction costs from selling underlying assets and potential market impact. Potentially lower costs by avoiding asset sales and reducing market impact. Why is CBOE BZX Pushing for SEC Approval for In-Kind Redemptions? CBOE BZX‚Äôs request to the SEC for approval isn‚Äôt just a procedural formality; it‚Äôs a strategic move aimed at making Bitcoin ETF and Ethereum ETF products more attractive and competitive. Here‚Äôs why this is a significant development: Cost Reduction: In-kind redemptions can significantly cut down transaction costs. By bypassing the need to sell the underlying Bitcoin or Ethereum to fulfill redemptions, ETF providers can avoid brokerage fees and potential market slippage. These savings can then be passed on to investors, making the ETFs more cost-effective. Improved Trading Efficiency: Direct asset exchange streamlines the redemption process. This efficiency is particularly beneficial for large institutional investors who trade in substantial volumes. Faster and smoother redemptions mean better liquidity and potentially tighter tracking of the ETF‚Äôs net asset value (NAV). Attracting Institutional Investors: In-kind redemptions are a familiar mechanism in traditional ETF markets, preferred by many institutional investors. By offering this option, Invesco Galaxy‚Äôs crypto ETFs become more aligned with institutional operational preferences, potentially attracting larger investments. Enhanced Market Stability: Some argue that in-kind redemptions can contribute to market stability. By reducing the need for ETF providers to frequently trade large volumes of Bitcoin or Ethereum on the open market to meet redemption requests, it could potentially lessen market volatility, especially during periods of high trading activity. The SEC‚Äôs Crucial Role and the Road Ahead The SEC approval is the linchpin in this entire process. The SEC has opened a public comment period, inviting feedback from market participants and the public before making a final decision. This is a standard procedure, allowing the commission to gather diverse perspectives and ensure that the proposed rule change aligns with investor protection and market integrity principles. Here‚Äôs what the SEC will likely consider: Investor Protection: The SEC‚Äôs primary concern is always investor protection. They will assess whether in-kind redemptions introduce any new risks for ETF investors and if adequate safeguards are in place. Market Integrity: The commission will evaluate the impact of in-kind redemptions on the overall market structure and integrity. They need to ensure that the mechanism doesn‚Äôt create opportunities for manipulation or unfair practices. Operational Feasibility: The SEC will also consider the operational aspects of in-kind redemptions. They will want to be confident that ETF providers and authorized participants can smoothly and securely manage the exchange of underlying assets. Public Comments: The feedback received during the public comment period will be a crucial input in the SEC‚Äôs decision-making process. This allows the SEC to understand the broader market sentiment and address any potential concerns raised by stakeholders. Invesco Galaxy Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs: A Closer Look The ETFs at the heart of this proposal are the Invesco Galaxy spot Bitcoin ETF and Ethereum ETF . These are significant products in the burgeoning crypto ETF market. Invesco, in partnership with Galaxy Digital, a prominent player in the digital asset space, is aiming to provide investors with regulated and accessible exposure to Bitcoin and Ethereum. Key highlights of these ETFs include: Spot Exposure: Unlike futures-based ETFs, these are spot ETFs, meaning they directly hold Bitcoin and Ethereum. This is generally preferred by investors seeking direct exposure to the price movements of these cryptocurrencies. Reputable Issuers: Invesco‚Äôs established track record in asset management combined with Galaxy Digital‚Äôs crypto expertise lends credibility and trust to these ETF offerings. Potential for Growth: With regulatory winds potentially shifting in favor of crypto ETFs and mechanisms like in-kind redemptions enhancing efficiency, these ETFs are positioned for significant growth and adoption, especially among institutional investors. What Does This Mean for the Future of Crypto ETFs? If the SEC approves CBOE BZX‚Äôs request, it could set a new precedent for crypto ETF operations in the U.S. In-kind redemptions could become a standard feature for spot Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs, making them more competitive with traditional ETFs and more appealing to institutional investors. This could unlock a wave of institutional capital into the crypto market, further legitimizing and mainstreaming digital assets. The approval could also pave the way for more innovation in ETF structures and mechanisms within the crypto space. It signals a growing maturity in the regulatory approach towards digital assets and a willingness to adapt traditional financial mechanisms to the unique characteristics of the crypto market. Final Thoughts: A Potential Game Changer for Crypto ETF Investing CBOE BZX‚Äôs push for in-kind redemptions in Invesco Galaxy‚Äôs Bitcoin ETF and Ethereum ETF is more than just a technical rule change. It represents a potential evolution in how crypto ETFs operate and are perceived in the market. By seeking SEC approval for this mechanism, CBOE BZX is aiming to enhance efficiency, reduce costs, and ultimately make these investment vehicles more attractive, particularly to institutional investors. The SEC‚Äôs decision in the coming weeks or months will be closely watched, as it could significantly influence the trajectory of crypto ETFs and the broader adoption of digital assets in mainstream finance.

With their values under continuous pressure, enthusiasts are eager to know when these cryptocurrencies might break free and soar. Delving into market trends and signals, this article aims to uncover if a potential rebound is on the horizon for these digital assets. Upward Momentum for Cardano Amid Market Fluctuations ADA recorded a slight gain of about 1% last month , while over the past six months it surged nearly 100%. The price history indicates a strong overall recovery, despite a recent drop of 26% in one week. This long-term rise highlights a contrasting performance with the softer monthly results, demonstrating notable market volatility. The current price range fluctuates between $0.44 and $0.88, with key resistance at $1.15 and support at $0.26. Bulls and bears seem evenly matched, reflected by neutral oscillators and an RSI near 46. Traders should keep an eye on support for a potential bounce and watch for a breakout above resistance as an opportunity for further gains. XRP Market Analysis: Short-Term Dip Amid Six-Month Surge XRP showed a contrasting behavior over recent periods . The coin dropped about 8% over the past month while surging nearly 289% over the last six months. This swing highlights a volatile period where short-term corrections contrast sharply with long-term gains. Recent performance reflects significant upward movement in the broader timeframe despite a decline in the immediate period, suggesting a potential for recovery after recent dips. Current trading levels place XRP between a support near $1.06 and a resistance at $3.61, with a further barrier at $4.89. Price action confined within the $1.60 to $2.88 range, along with indicators like a below-50 RSI, suggests bears hold sway in the short run. Range-bound trades appear favorable while waiting for a clear breakout to signal a decisive trend shift. Conclusion ADA and XRP have shown resilience in the face of bearish trends. Both coins have strong communities and development teams. ADA's ongoing technological upgrades and XRP's legal victories bring hope. Market conditions and investor sentiment play crucial roles in their potential recovery. A breakout moment depends on overcoming key resistance levels. Watch for significant market catalysts and broader adoption that could drive momentum. In the near term, patience and close monitoring are essential for forecast accuracy.

Ethereum ( ETH ) crashed to 0.023 against Bitcoin ( BTC ), its lowest level since May 2020 and 74% below its highest level during the pandemic. Similarly, the coin dropped to a low of $1,770, its lowest point since October 2023, and 57% from its highest level in December of last year. The ongoing Ethereum price crash is attributed to several factors like the ongoing ETF outflows , increased competition from layer-1 and layer-2 networks, and the fact that it is no longer the most profitable players in the crypto industry. Analysts at Kraken have also identified another reason by looking at the futures market. In a note to crypto.news, Alexia Theodorou, the head of derivatives, said in a statement to crypto.news that ETH weekly linear futures had entered backwardation for the first time since August last year. Bitcoin futures, on the other hand, have remained in contango in this period. The statement said: ‚ÄúEther‚Äôs linear weekly futures have entered backwardation for the first time since last August, reflecting growing bearish sentiment in the market and following a sharp 20% decline in the ETH price. Bitcoin‚Äôs futures remain in contango, suggesting relative strength in BTC amid broader market uncertainty.‚Äù Linear weekly futures are those contracts that settle weekly and pay out in a straightforward way based on prices. By moving into backwardation, it means that the futures price has become lower than the spot price, which is a sign that the market expects the price to drop further.

In an announcement on Thursday, Ripple confirmed that the Dubai Financial Services Authority (DFSA) has granted it a license to offer regulated crypto payments and services. This milestone makes Ripple the first blockchain-powered payments provider to receive such authorization within the DIFC. Notably, the approval marks Ripple‚Äôs first regulatory license in the Middle East, reinforcing its status as a trusted partner for financial institutions seeking to leverage digital assets for seamless cross-border transactions. Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse emphasized the significance of the approval, writing, ‚Äú We are entering an unprecedented period of growth for the crypto industry, driven by greater regulatory clarity worldwide and increasing institutional adoption.‚Äù He also praised the UAE‚Äôs proactive approach to innovation, noting that its early leadership in fostering a supportive environment for technology and crypto positions the country to reap significant benefits. DIFC CEO Arif Amiri welcomed Ripple‚Äôs regulatory milestone, thanking the San Francisco-based Fin-tech firm for deepening its commitment to Dubai by securing a DFSA license. According to World Bank data, the UAE‚Äôs cross-border payments market is valued at $40 billion, positioning Dubai as a key global financial hub. Ripple has seen rising demand in the Middle East, as crypto-native firms and traditional financial institutions seek blockchain-based solutions to overcome inefficiencies in cross-border transactions, including high fees, slow settlement times, and lack of transparency. A 2024 Ripple business survey revealed that 64% of finance leaders in the Middle East and Africa (MEA) region consider faster payments and settlement times the biggest advantage of blockchain-based solutions. Ripple established its Middle East headquarters in DIFC in 2020 and has since steadily expanded in the region. With approximately 20% of its global customer base already operating in the Middle East, this regulatory approval is expected to accelerate its growth further. The latest milestone follows Ripple‚Äôs August 2024 partnership with the DIFC to drive institutional adoption of blockchain and digital assets in the region. In late 2021, Ripple announced a partnership with Pyypl, a UAE-based blockchain financial services firm. This marked the first-ever in-market deployment of On-Demand Liquidity (ODL) in the Middle East. This initiative aimed to enable instant, low-cost remittances, starting with the UAE. That said, as regulatory clarity improves worldwide, Ripple expands its footprint.

The Bitcoin network is ""evolving into a broader decentralized finance ecosystem with the emergence of Bitcoin DeFi,"" analyst Moulik Nagesh wrote. This is a sector that ""unlocks bitcoin's capital efficiency"" with the use of financial applications focused on lending, staking, stablecoins and decentralized exchanges (DEX's), the report said. DeFi is an umbrella term used for lending, trading and other financial activities carried out on a blockchain, without the need for traditional intermediaries. Binance noted that only ~0.8% of the bitcoin supply is currently being used in DeFi, and this presents a large ""untapped opportunity."" In fact, last year, Julian Love, a deal analyst at Franklin Templeton Digital Assets, said the opportunity could be as much as $1 trillion . Binance Research report said that Bitcoin needs layer 2s as the network lacks ""native programmability,"" unlike smart contract-based layer 1s. A layer 1 network is the base layer or the underlying infrastructure of a blockchain. Layer 2 refers to a set of off-chain systems or separate blockchains built on top of layer 1s. While there has been some progress on the development of Bitcoin layer-2 networks, these platforms need greater adoption and liquidity incentives to be able to scale up effectively, Binance Research said. The network's security model is faced with ""long-term sustainability challenges"" as block rewards will continue to halve, the report said, thereby reducing miner incentives. The long-term viability of Bitcoin DeFi is dependent on execution, the further development of layer-2s, and the ""ability to align with bitcoin's unique value proposition,"" the report added.

In a move signaling a firmer stance on digital assets, Turkey has officially tightened its crypto regulations, handing the reins of oversight to the Capital Markets Board (CMB). This development marks a pivotal moment for crypto asset service providers (CASPs) operating within the nation and sets the stage for a more structured and secure crypto environment. For anyone involved in or observing the Turkish crypto market, understanding these new rules is crucial. Let‚Äôs delve into the specifics of these regulations and what they mean for the future of crypto in Turkey. What‚Äôs Driving Turkey‚Äôs New Crypto Regulations Turkey ? The global regulatory landscape for cryptocurrencies is rapidly evolving. Countries worldwide are grappling with how to best integrate and oversee this burgeoning asset class. Turkey‚Äôs recent regulatory update is not happening in isolation; it‚Äôs part of a broader trend towards establishing clear frameworks for crypto operations. Several factors are likely driving this shift in Turkey: Investor Protection: A primary concern for regulators globally is safeguarding investors from potential risks associated with the volatile crypto market. These risks can range from market manipulation and fraud to the inherent price volatility of cryptocurrencies. Stricter regulations aim to create a safer environment for Turkish citizens engaging with crypto assets. Financial Stability: As the crypto market grows, its potential impact on the broader financial system becomes more significant. Regulators are keen to ensure that the crypto sector doesn‚Äôt pose a threat to financial stability. This involves monitoring and controlling risks associated with money laundering, terrorist financing, and illicit activities. Global Alignment: The reference to Europe‚Äôs Markets in Crypto-Assets Regulation (MiCA) in the initial report is telling. Turkey is clearly looking to align its regulatory framework with international standards. MiCA, in particular, is becoming a benchmark for comprehensive crypto regulation, and adopting similar principles can facilitate cross-border crypto activities and enhance Turkey‚Äôs standing in the global financial arena. Economic Factors: Turkey‚Äôs economic situation and the appeal of cryptocurrencies as an alternative investment and store of value in times of economic uncertainty may also be a factor. Regulations can provide a degree of control and oversight in this context. Decoding the New Turkey Crypto Regulation Framework The core of these new regulations centers around bringing Crypto Asset Service Providers (CASPs) under the full oversight of the Capital Markets Board (CMB). What does this actually entail for these providers and for users of crypto services in Turkey? Key Changes Introduced by the New Regulations: CMB Oversight: The most significant change is the formal granting of oversight authority to the CMB. This means that crypto exchanges, custodian services, and wallet providers will now be directly regulated by the CMB, similar to traditional financial institutions. This move is designed to bring greater accountability and transparency to the crypto sector. Compliance Infrastructure Investments: CASPs are now mandated to invest in robust compliance infrastructure. This likely includes systems for Know Your Customer (KYC) verification, Anti-Money Laundering (AML) monitoring, and transaction reporting. These investments are crucial for preventing illicit activities and ensuring regulatory compliance. Stricter Reporting Requirements: Expect increased reporting obligations for CASPs. They will likely need to provide regular reports to the CMB on their operations, customer data (within privacy regulations), and transaction activities. This enhanced reporting will enable the CMB to effectively monitor the market and identify potential risks. Alignment with MiCA: The regulations are designed to align with global standards, notably Europe‚Äôs MiCA. This suggests that Turkey is adopting a comprehensive approach to crypto regulation, taking cues from international best practices. This alignment could potentially ease the process for international crypto firms looking to operate in Turkey, and vice versa. Benefits of Stricter Crypto Regulation CMB Oversight While stricter regulations might initially seem like a hurdle for crypto businesses, they also bring a range of potential benefits to the Turkish crypto ecosystem and its participants: Increased Legitimacy and Trust: Formal regulation by a recognized body like the CMB can significantly enhance the legitimacy of the crypto sector in Turkey. This can boost investor confidence and attract more users to regulated platforms, fostering growth in a more secure environment. Reduced Risk of Fraud and Scams: Stronger KYC and AML requirements, coupled with CMB oversight, will make it harder for fraudulent schemes and illicit activities to thrive within the Turkish crypto space. This protection is vital for both individual investors and the overall reputation of the market. Clarity and Legal Certainty: Clear regulations provide legal certainty for businesses operating in the crypto sector. This clarity reduces ambiguity and allows companies to operate with confidence, knowing the rules of the game. It also encourages innovation within a defined legal framework. Potential for Institutional Investment: As the regulatory environment becomes more defined and secure, it could pave the way for increased institutional investment in crypto assets within Turkey. Institutional investors often require regulatory clarity before committing significant capital. Improved Market Stability: While crypto markets are inherently volatile, regulations can help mitigate some forms of market manipulation and excessive speculation, potentially leading to a more stable and mature market over time. Challenges and Considerations for Crypto Asset Service Providers Implementing these new regulations will undoubtedly present challenges for Crypto Asset Service Providers (CASPs) in Turkey. These challenges need to be addressed to ensure a smooth transition and the continued growth of the crypto sector: Challenge Description Compliance Costs: Investing in compliance infrastructure, hiring compliance officers, and adhering to reporting requirements can be costly, especially for smaller CASPs. This could create barriers to entry and potentially disadvantage smaller players in the market. Implementation Complexity: Understanding and implementing the new regulations can be complex. CASPs will need to navigate new legal requirements and operational procedures, which may require significant time and resources. Balancing Innovation and Regulation: Finding the right balance between fostering innovation in the crypto space and implementing necessary regulations is crucial. Overly burdensome regulations could stifle innovation and push crypto activity underground or offshore. User Privacy Concerns: Increased KYC and reporting requirements may raise privacy concerns among crypto users. Regulations need to be carefully designed to balance security and compliance with the protection of user privacy. Enforcement and Adaptability: Effective enforcement of the regulations by the CMB is essential. Furthermore, the regulatory framework needs to be adaptable to the rapidly evolving nature of the crypto market and technological advancements. Drawing Parallels with MiCA Regulation : A Global Perspective Turkey‚Äôs move to align with Europe‚Äôs Markets in Crypto-Assets Regulation (MiCA) is a significant indicator of its regulatory approach. MiCA is considered one of the most comprehensive and forward-looking crypto regulatory frameworks globally. Understanding MiCA can offer insights into the potential direction of Turkey‚Äôs crypto regulations: Comprehensive Scope: MiCA covers a wide range of crypto-assets and crypto-asset service providers, aiming for a holistic regulatory approach. Turkey‚Äôs regulations, by granting broad oversight to the CMB, seem to be adopting a similar comprehensive scope. Licensing and Authorization: MiCA introduces a licensing regime for CASPs operating within the EU. While Turkey‚Äôs regulations details are still unfolding, it‚Äôs plausible that a similar authorization or licensing process for CASPs could be implemented under CMB oversight. Consumer Protection Focus: A core principle of MiCA is strong consumer protection. Turkey‚Äôs emphasis on investor protection and stricter reporting aligns with this consumer-centric approach. Innovation-Friendly Approach: Despite being comprehensive, MiCA is also designed to be innovation-friendly, allowing for regulatory sandboxes and adaptable frameworks. Hopefully, Turkey‚Äôs regulations will also strike a balance between control and fostering innovation in the crypto sector. Actionable Insights for Crypto Participants in Turkey For individuals and businesses involved in the crypto space in Turkey, here are some actionable insights in light of these new regulations: For CASPs: Prioritize Compliance: Immediately begin assessing your compliance infrastructure and processes. Invest in necessary upgrades to meet the new regulatory requirements. Engage with Regulators: Proactively engage with the CMB to seek clarification on specific aspects of the regulations and ensure a smooth transition. Transparency is Key: Embrace transparency in your operations and communication with users. This will build trust and demonstrate your commitment to regulatory compliance. For Crypto Users: Choose Regulated Platforms: Opt for crypto exchanges and service providers that are demonstrably compliant with the new Turkish regulations. This offers greater protection and security. Stay Informed: Keep abreast of the evolving regulatory landscape in Turkey. Understanding the rules will help you navigate the crypto market safely and effectively. Exercise Caution: Even with regulations, the crypto market remains inherently risky. Continue to exercise caution, conduct thorough research, and only invest what you can afford to lose. Conclusion: A Bold Step Towards a Mature Crypto Market Turkey‚Äôs move to tighten crypto regulations and grant the CMB oversight is a bold and decisive step towards creating a more mature and regulated crypto market.

With its new Dubai license, Ripple is poised to tap into the UAE‚Äôs flourishing $40 billion cross-border payments market. Ripple Secures Regulatory Approval To Offer Crypto Payments In UAE Ripple has just obtained a license to offer blockchain-powered payment solutions in Dubai. The approval makes Ripple the first payments provider of its kind licensed to operate within the Dubai International Financial Centre (DIFC) and marks a huge expansion in the Middle East. ‚ÄúWe are entering an unprecedented period of growth for the crypto industry, driven by greater regulatory clarity around the world and increasing institutional adoption,‚Äù said Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse in a statement . https://twitter.com/Ripple/status/1900049647239934345 Garlinghouse added that the UAE is ‚Äúexceptionally well-placed‚Äù to benefit from this period of growth as it has taken early steps to create a conducive environment for cryptocurrency innovation. The latest approval follows Ripple‚Äôs in-principle DFSA license approval in October 2024, which allowed the firm to launch its services in the DIFC, a UAE free-zone with its own tax policies and regulatory framework. ‚ÄúThis latest regulatory approval positions Ripple to further accelerate growth and innovation in a high-potential market,‚Äù Ripple wrote. The company noted on March 13 that the United Arab Emirates boasts a $40 billion cross-border payments market, which has witnessed demand for more seamless payment solutions. Ripple believes the need for real-time settlements will also fuel stablecoin adoption in the region. Ripple‚Äôs U.S.-dollar-backed RLUSD stablecoin launched in December and currently has a market capitalization of around $135 million. Ripple vs. SEC Ripple‚Äôs official entry into the UAE market comes amid reports that the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is preparing to end its enforcement action against the company after more than four years. This comes as the agency, under U.S. President Donald Trump and the helm of Mark Uyeda , has shifted to a positive stance on crypto. Despite the prolonged case, Ripple remained undeterred, boasting an extensive license portfolio. With the DFSA license, Ripple‚Äôs global regulatory approval count now exceeds 60, including a Major Payments Institution license from the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) and the New York Department of Financial Services (NYDFS) Trust Charter, among others. Ripple‚Äôs Dubai license and the potential resolution of the Ripple-SEC lawsuit are set to position XRP for more mainstream adoption, as the XRPArmy envisions the highly coveted $3 price point.

Speaking on CNBC‚Äôs Squawk Box on Thursday, Schwab called for the Trump administration to formulate trade agreements by working with allies Canada and Mexico to compete with China. Schwab explained that even though trade agreements must be enforced, China‚Äôs persistent failure to honor its commitments makes the country hard to work with. ‚Äú China is definitely an exception because China has systematically gone against a lot of commitments that it has made ,‚Äù Schwab said. ‚Äú It is overwhelming the world, not just the U.S., with its overcapacity, oversupply, basically exporting its economic mistakes and wiping out manufacturing capacity all over the world. ‚Äù Former US Trade Representative Susan Schwab talks tariffs on CNBC‚Äôs Squawk Box She urged the US to collaborate with like-minded countries rather than imposing measures that could break its relations with allies. ‚Äú We should be working with rather than hitting like-minded countries and allies on that score ,‚Äù the former trade rep. remarked. What America needs from the USMCA debate Schwab was asked about where she felt the 2018 United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA) stood as of now and if trade tariffs should be used as leverage to renegotiate aspects of the deal. CNBC mentioned Canada‚Äôs tariffs on US products like milk (270%), cheese (245%), butter (298%), poultry (238%), eggs (153%), barley (150%), and peanut butter (295%), were all in the USMCA. The 69-year-old politician acknowledged the issues with Canada‚Äôs trade policies on products like dairy but defended the USMCA as an achievement for Trump 1.0. ‚Äú Like any negotiation, like any deal, whether it‚Äôs a government-to-government deal or a commercial deal, you‚Äôre going to end up accepting things you don‚Äôt like, ‚Äù she said. Still, she criticized Canada‚Äôs supply management system, pinning the trade dispute blame on both sides of the border. ‚Äú I hate Canada‚Äôs supply management. There are things about the Canadian trade regime that hurt us, no question at all. There are also things we do ,‚Äù According to Schwab, renegotiating the USMCA through threats of tariffs is rather ‚Äúexcessive.‚Äù ‚Äú Everybody had to suck it in and accept some things we didn‚Äôt like .‚Äù U.S. tariff ‚Äòstrategy‚Äô lacks clear goals Schwab questioned the strategy behind US tariff policies, pointing out that they have been proposed for reasons that are not quite ‚Äòconcise,‚Äô including unfair trade practices and supplementing US government revenue. Last Sunday, President Trump had said that tariffs would make America ‚Äúvery rich.‚Äù ‚Äú One of the issues that I have‚Ä¶ I have a hard time identifying a strategy and a set of goals here because there are a lot of different asks going on ,‚Äù she continued. ‚Äú Yesterday was steel and aluminum. When the administration came in, it was fentanyl. It‚Äôs been immigration. We‚Äôre talking about unfair trade practices. We‚Äôre talking about pay-fors for supplementing US government revenues, for tax cuts, for the budget .‚Äù She propounded that Trump‚Äôs objectives for these policies are imprecise. ‚Äú If you‚Äôre using a tariff as leverage to get something else, then in theory, when you get that, you take the tariff off. Well, that means that if you wanted to use it as a source of revenue, you can‚Äôt because you‚Äôve taken it off .‚Äù Job losses and building manufacturing backup The discussion also touched on the perception that America, as the Trump administration claims, no longer produces goods domestically. CNBC asked whether bringing manufacturing back to the US would help revive jobs in industrial regions like the Rust Belt. ‚Äú Politicians in many cases are fond of saying we don‚Äôt make things in the United States anymore. And that‚Äôs not true. We make a lot. In fact, manufacturing output has gone up pretty steadily in the U.S. It‚Äôs just manufacturing employment that‚Äôs gone down ,‚Äù she surmised. The former US trade representative asserted that policymakers should avoid trade policies that increase input costs for American manufacturers because they make US-based industries like auto and shipbuilding less competitive. ‚Äú You shouldn‚Äôt be coming up with a trade policy that jeopardizes your competitiveness, where you are consistently raising the cost of inputs to your manufacturing capacity. ‚Äù Cryptopolitan Academy: Tired of market swings?

The analyst alluded to historical performances and bullish fundamentals to drive home his point that this price target this year. Why An XRP Price Rally To $10 Is Reasonable In an X post , Egrag Crypto suggested that an XRP price rally to $10 wasn‚Äôt really difficult, seeing as the crypto only needs to record about a 2.94x increase from its current price level to reach this target. The analyst alluded to past cycles to put things into perspective and explain why this price prediction is reasonable. First, he noted that the Bitcoin price increased 21x in the last cycle, rallying from $3,000 to $69,000. Meanwhile, the Ethereum price recorded a 58x increase, rallying from $81 to $4,891. As such, Egrag Crypto is confident that XRP can also witness a similar parabolic price increase. He remarked that the XRP price has already done the hardest part, having recorded a 13x increase from $0.28 to around $3.40 over the last two years. The analyst added that all that is needed to reach this $10 target is a 3 to 4x increase. Egrag Crypto also highlighted bullish fundamentals for XRP, which could spark this rally to $10. He noted that 17 XRP ETFs are in the pipeline, regulatory clarity is almost here, and the SEC Ripple lawsuit is wrapping up. As CoinGape reported, a Ripple SEC settlement could happen soon enough. The analyst added that real-world utility and adoption are expanding, providing a bullish outlook for XRP. In line with this, he remarked that a $500 to $700 billion market cap for the crypto is ‚Äúcompletely reasonable in this environment.‚Äù Triple Digits In The Next Cycle Egrag Crypto also raised the possibility of the XRP price rallying to triple digits in the next cycle. The analyst stated that the ease of reaching triple digits depends on this cycle‚Äôs peak. He then outlined scenarios to map out how the crypto could rally to $100 and above. First, he stated the ‚ÄòPessimistic Scenario‚Äô in which XRP would require a 30x move to reach $100 in the next cycle if it tops out at $3.40 this cycle. If the crypto tops at $3.40, the analyst noted that a rally to $100 in the next cycle would require massive overall crypto market expansion, although he said it was inevitable. Egrag Crypto remarked that crypto adoption is just at 1.5% of its total potential as the ‚ÄòInternet of Value‚Äô is set to absorb trillions from global industries. He added that crypto will become the 12th major economic sector, integrating into existing sectors such as healthcare, finance and insurance, and information technology. The analyst then mentioned the ‚ÄòConservative Scenario‚Äô as the second one. He stated that if XRP reaches between $10 and $20 this cycle, then hitting $100 next cycle only requires a 5x to 10x move, which is ‚Äúvery reasonable.‚Äù The last is the ‚ÄòOptimistic Scenario‚Äô in which the analyst stated that if the XRP price surges to between $27 and $33, then it needs only a 3 to 4x increase to reach the $100 target. Egrag Crypto remarked that such a price increase will surely happen in a full-fledged bull market .

41602472,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=139884,1741888812,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Power Surge: UBS Boosts EUR/USD Forecast on German Fiscal Package ‚Äì A Bold Euro Outlook,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/ubs-boosts-eur-usd-forecast/,"In the fast-paced world of Forex trading, staying ahead of the curve is paramount. Just when you thought you had a handle on the EUR/USD pair, a major player like UBS steps in with a significant forecast revision. Buckle up, because the landscape for the Euro against the US Dollar is shifting, and it‚Äôs largely thanks to a robust German fiscal package . This isn‚Äôt just another minor adjustment; it‚Äôs a noteworthy upgrade that could ripple through the Forex market and beyond. Let‚Äôs dive deep into what‚Äôs driving this bullish EUR/USD forecast and what it could mean for you. Decoding the UBS EUR/USD Forecast Upgrade UBS, a global financial heavyweight, has recently revised its EUR/USD forecast upwards, signaling a stronger Euro against the US Dollar than previously anticipated. This isn‚Äôt a decision made lightly. It‚Äôs based on a thorough analysis of various economic indicators and, crucially, the impact of Germany‚Äôs newly announced fiscal measures. But what exactly does this upgrade entail? Revised Expectations: UBS now projects a higher EUR/USD exchange rate in the coming months, suggesting they believe the Euro will appreciate against the Dollar. Driving Force: The primary catalyst behind this revision is the German fiscal package, designed to stimulate economic growth within Europe‚Äôs largest economy. Market Impact: Such forecasts from major institutions like UBS can significantly influence market sentiment and trading strategies in the Forex market . This upgrade is a significant signal for anyone involved in Forex trading, international business, or even those keeping an eye on global economic trends. But to truly understand the magnitude, we need to dissect the German fiscal package and its intended effects. The Power of the German Fiscal Package: Fueling the Euro Outlook Germany, often seen as the economic engine of Europe, has unveiled a substantial fiscal package. Fiscal packages are essentially government plans to boost the economy through spending and tax policies. In Germany‚Äôs case, this package is designed to: Stimulate Domestic Demand: By increasing government spending or cutting taxes, the aim is to encourage businesses and consumers to spend more, boosting economic activity. Invest in Infrastructure: Often, fiscal packages include investments in infrastructure projects, which not only create jobs but also enhance long-term productivity. Support Key Sectors: Specific sectors of the economy might receive targeted support to foster innovation and growth. Why is this German fiscal package so crucial for the Euro outlook ? Because Germany‚Äôs economic health has a significant ripple effect across the Eurozone. A stronger German economy often translates to a stronger Euro. Think of it like this: if the engine of a car (Germany) gets a performance boost, the entire car (Eurozone economy) is likely to run more powerfully. Benefits of the German Fiscal Package for the Euro The German fiscal package is expected to inject fresh momentum into the Eurozone economy, particularly benefiting the Euro in several ways: Increased Investor Confidence: A proactive fiscal policy signals to investors that Germany is serious about economic growth, making the Eurozone a more attractive investment destination. Potential for Higher Interest Rates: If the fiscal package successfully stimulates inflation, the European Central Bank (ECB) might consider raising interest rates sooner than anticipated. Higher interest rates typically make a currency more appealing to foreign investors, boosting its value. Improved Economic Data: As the fiscal measures take effect, we could see improvements in key economic indicators like GDP growth, employment, and consumer spending within Germany and potentially the broader Eurozone. Positive economic data generally supports a currency‚Äôs strength. UBS‚Äôs Rationale: Why the Bullish EUR/USD Forecast? UBS isn‚Äôt just reacting to the German fiscal package in isolation. Their upgraded EUR/USD forecast is likely based on a holistic assessment of several factors, including: Anticipated Impact of the Fiscal Package: UBS economists have likely analyzed the specifics of the German plan and projected its likely impact on German and Eurozone economic growth. Their forecast suggests they believe the impact will be substantial and positive for the Euro. Relative Economic Performance: Forex rates are often driven by the relative economic strength of different regions. If Germany‚Äôs economy is expected to outperform the US economy (or grow at a faster pace than previously anticipated due to the fiscal package), this would naturally favor a stronger Euro against the Dollar. Monetary Policy Expectations: While fiscal policy is in Germany‚Äôs hands, monetary policy is set by the ECB. UBS‚Äôs forecast might also incorporate expectations about how the ECB will react to the fiscal stimulus. As mentioned, successful fiscal stimulus could lead to earlier interest rate hikes, supporting the Euro. Technical Analysis and Market Positioning: Beyond fundamental economic factors, UBS analysts also consider technical chart patterns and market positioning to refine their forecasts. This involves looking at historical price movements and the current positions of traders in the Forex market . Navigating the Forex Market with the Updated EUR/USD Forecast So, what does this all mean for those involved in the Forex market ? Here are some potential implications and considerations: Trading Opportunities: A bullish EUR/USD forecast suggests potential buying opportunities for the Euro against the Dollar. Traders might consider taking long positions on EUR/USD, anticipating further appreciation of the Euro. Risk Management is Key: While the forecast is positive, the Forex market is inherently volatile. It‚Äôs crucial to implement robust risk management strategies, including setting stop-loss orders, to protect against unexpected market swings. Stay Informed: Economic forecasts are not guarantees. Continuously monitor economic data releases from Germany, the Eurozone, and the US, as well as any statements from the ECB and the German government, to stay updated on factors influencing the EUR/USD pair. Diversification: Don‚Äôt put all your eggs in one basket. Diversify your trading portfolio across different currency pairs and asset classes to mitigate risk. Challenges and Considerations: Is the Euro‚Äôs Rise Guaranteed? While the UBS forecast and the German fiscal package paint a positive picture for the Euro, it‚Äôs important to acknowledge potential challenges and factors that could influence the Euro outlook : Challenge/Consideration Potential Impact on EUR/USD Global Economic Slowdown: A significant global economic slowdown could dampen the positive effects of the German fiscal package and negatively impact the Euro. US Economic Resilience: If the US economy proves more resilient than anticipated, the Dollar could regain strength, potentially limiting the Euro‚Äôs upside. ECB Policy Shifts: Unexpected shifts in ECB monetary policy, such as a more dovish stance, could weaken the Euro. Geopolitical Risks: Unforeseen geopolitical events could trigger risk-off sentiment, potentially benefiting the safe-haven Dollar at the expense of the Euro. Implementation Challenges of Fiscal Package: The actual implementation of the German fiscal package might face delays or be less effective than initially projected, reducing its positive impact on the Euro. These challenges highlight that while the German fiscal package is a significant tailwind for the Euro, the Forex market is complex and influenced by numerous factors. A successful Euro outlook isn‚Äôt solely dependent on German policy; global economic conditions and other central bank actions also play a crucial role. Conclusion: A Glimpse of a Stronger Euro? UBS‚Äôs upgraded EUR/USD forecast , driven by the German fiscal package, offers a compelling glimpse into the potential for a stronger Euro. The German government‚Äôs proactive measures to stimulate its economy could indeed provide a significant boost to the Eurozone and, consequently, the Euro itself. For those navigating the Forex market , this development presents both opportunities and the need for careful monitoring. While the forecast suggests a positive trajectory for EUR/USD, the dynamic nature of global economics and unforeseen events mean that staying informed, managing risk effectively, and maintaining a balanced perspective are more critical than ever. The Euro outlook is certainly brighter, but vigilance and adaptability remain the cornerstones of successful Forex trading.

In a new interview with CNBC, Teng says that America‚Äôs embrace of digital assets under US President Donald Trump, including the launch of a strategic Bitcoin reserve, is a massive bullish catalyst for the whole industry. ‚ÄúLook at the long-term drivers. If you ask anybody in the crypto industry, people prefer the current administration compared to the last one. With the last administration, you had operation ‚ÄòChoke Point 2.0‚Äô in progress. And then you had regulation by enforcement, which makes it extremely tough for the industry to grow. And President Trump came in very pro-crypto, came in and introduced a strategic reserve for the US and crypto, I think that‚Äôs a very landmark issue on that front. And he has appointed many smart administrators to the respective [regulatory] agencies, and he has the Senate and the House behind him with very pro-crypto legislators. So we are very bullish on that front. So long-term drivers are strong.‚Äù He also says that crypto markets are correcting like other assets amid the recent macroeconomic uncertainties, such as what the impacts of Trump‚Äôs tariff policies will be. ‚ÄúThe crypto market, as with any asset class, is not immune to macroeconomic situations. What we believe we‚Äôre seeing is a technical retreat rather than a structural decline. If you remember 2022, Bitcoin, after several rounds of Fed rate hikes then, was below $20,000 but it bounced back up. So again, this is one of those situations.‚Äù Lastly, he says that the launch of the US‚Äôs strategic Bitcoin reserve may prompt other governments to accumulate the flagship crypto asset. ‚ÄúThe messaging is, the largest government, the largest economy, the biggest capital market in the world is now holding Bitcoin as part of a reserve. It‚Äôll cause many other governments to think through the issue, to sit up to say, Hey, should we start doing allocation into crypto and Bitcoin? Many sovereign wealth funds are already starting to consider the issue. We were at Davos together, and [BlackRock CEO] Larry Fink spoke at that and said in his conversations with all the big sovereign wealth funds it‚Äôs not a question of whether to allocate, it‚Äôs whether allocating 2% or 5%. So we are having a lot of those important conversations now. The long-term drivers are very, very strong.‚Äù Don't Miss a Beat ‚Äì Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox Check Price Action Follow us on X , Facebook and Telegram Surf The Daily Hodl Mix Disclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

This stabilization follows a volatile week where Bitcoin hit a four-month low of approximately $76,600 on March 11 before rebounding above $83,000. Notably, the recent pullback has been largely influenced by macroeconomic factors, including concerns over tariffs and economic slowdowns, leading investors to move away from riskier assets. Market structure analysis supports this narrative, with persistent selling pressure, particularly from short-term holders, as noted by Glassnode analysts. ‚ÄúSince prices dropped below $95K, the 196-hour moving average of STH-SOPR has remained below 1, suggesting that most short-term investors are realizing losses,‚Äù they reported . Further data from Coinglass indicates that Bitcoin‚Äôs Accumulation Trend Score has remained near 0.1 since early January, while the CBD Heatmap reveals a diminishing ‚Äúbuy-the-dip‚Äù response. This points to Bitcoin entering a post-all-time-high distribution phase, marked by declining aggregate demand and continued selling from investors who bought at higher prices. Despite the market struggles, whales have been aggressively accumulating Bitcoin. CryptoQuant analyst Caueconomy highlighted that large investors have acquired over 65,000 BTC in the past month, excluding purchases by miners and exchanges. ‚Äú Whales accumulated more than 65,000 BTC in the last month,‚Äù Caueconomy noted Tuesday. ‚ÄúIf this pattern continues for a few more weeks, it could indicate sustained buying pressure, similar to what we saw between November and December.‚Äù Moreover, several other on-chain indicators suggest Bitcoin could be setting up for a recovery. CryptoQuant analysts point to historical patterns where Bitcoin‚Äôs price falling below the average cost basis of short-term holders has often signaled prime buying opportunities during bull markets. ‚ÄúBitcoin‚Äôs price has fallen below the Average Cost Basis of Short-Term Holders. In a bull market, this serves as a strong buy-the-dip indicator,‚Äù analyst Maartun observed. Meanwhile, Binance whale activity suggests a potential decline in selling pressure, according to analyst Darkfrost. The Bitcoin exchange whale ratio, a measure of top inflows relative to total inflows, is decreasing, a trend that has historically signaled bullish movements. ‚ÄúElevated values indicate higher selling pressure, while a declining ratio suggests whales are easing off selling. Historically, this has preceded bullish trends,‚Äù Darkfrost noted on Wednesday. Despite these positive indicators, analysts remain divided on Bitcoin‚Äôs short-term price trajectory. Some predict a further dip before a stronger rally. Former BitMEX CEO Arthur Hayes expects Bitcoin to bottom around $70,000, noting that a 36% correction from the $110,000 all-time high would be ‚Äúnormal for a bull market.‚Äù ‚Äú Looks like $BTC will retest $78K. If it fails, $75K is next in the crosshairs. There are a lot of options open interest between $70K-$75K‚Äîif we enter that range, it will be violent,‚Äù Hayes tweeted on Tuesday. Elsewhere, veteran trader Peter Brandt also pointed to bearish technical patterns, identifying a double top formation around $108,000. According to Brandt, Bitcoin‚Äôs failure to reclaim above the $92,000 neckline confirms a downside target near $75,000, calculated based on the pattern‚Äôs height subtracted from its neckline.",Bitcoin|News|Bitcoin News,EN,0,0,BTC|MARKET|TRADING|BUSINESS|EXCHANGE,"{'name': 'ZyCrypto', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/zycrypto.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",zycrypto,2025-03-13 18:05:17

Back then, traders were optimistically purchasing tokens as prices dipped. However, in the two weeks that followed, market cap declines have contributed to a noticeable shift in trader sentiment. Exhaustion, Hopelessness, And Capitulation According to Santiment‚Äôs analysis , this shift can be characterized by exhaustion, hopelessness, and capitulation. The drop in trading volume has continued, even amid brief price recoveries such as the one observed on Wednesday. This declining volume suggests a growing sense of caution among traders, indicating that many remain unconvinced that recent upward price movements will sustain. This lack of confidence is reflective of uncertainty, with fewer investors willing to buy at current levels due to concerns about potential losses. Additionally, declining trading volume during minor price rebounds can serve as an early warning of weakening market momentum. Without significant buying interest to support price gains, any recovery may prove temporary, leaving prices vulnerable to another downturn. While falling volume during brief rebounds is not inherently bearish, it does reflect hesitation from both retail and institutional traders. If both groups hold back, waiting for the other to re-enter the market and boost prices, this indecision may lead to stagnation with a slight downward bias. For a stronger and more sustainable recovery, Santiment said that traders typically look for rising prices accompanied by increased trading volume. Until this occurs, prevailing market sentiment is expected to remain cautious, and hesitant investor behavior will likely dominate crypto trading patterns in the short term. Stablecoin Activity Surges On a positive note, the total amount of tokens transferred for all stablecoins is surging , which points to a potential accumulation by large investors. Historically, such spikes occur during consolidation phases rather than price declines. Such a trend could mean that major investors are likely absorbing market shocks through over-the-counter (OTC) transactions. Increased active addresses further indicate increased network activity. With extreme fear sentiment dominating, this accumulation may point to a potential recovery phase. Once accumulation stabilizes, a futures market rebound is expected. Given the current ‚Äúsubdued‚Äù sentiment, any rise in futures prices is unlikely to overheat, but a short squeeze could accelerate recovery significantly.

Fortune‚Äôs review of these documents indicates that a notable number of high-profile government officials are dipping their toes, or perhaps plunging their hands, into the world of cryptocurrency. Specifically, six out of 22 cabinet members have reported investments in Bitcoin, either directly or indirectly, showcasing a growing acceptance, or at least interest, in digital assets at the highest levels of power. Let‚Äôs delve into the details of these Bitcoin holdings and what this revelation might signify for the future of crypto. Why are Bitcoin Holdings of Trump Cabinet Members News? The disclosure of Bitcoin holdings by former Trump cabinet members is significant for several reasons. Firstly, it provides a glimpse into the personal investment strategies of individuals who were, until recently, shaping U.S. economic and political policy. Their investment choices can be seen as a barometer of broader trends and potentially reflect a growing mainstream acceptance of cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin. Secondly, it raises interesting questions about the intersection of public service and private investment, particularly in a nascent and often debated asset class like crypto. Here‚Äôs a breakdown of the key individuals and their reported cryptocurrency investment : Robert Kennedy Jr. (Health Secretary): Reported Bitcoin holdings valued between $1 million and $5 million. This substantial investment is held through traditional financial giant Fidelity, indicating a move towards integrating Bitcoin into established investment platforms. Russell Vought (OMB Director): Disclosed Bitcoin holdings worth between $1,001 and $15,000, held via Coinbase, a popular cryptocurrency exchange. This suggests a more direct engagement with the crypto market through a dedicated platform. Tulsi Gabbard (National Intelligence Director): Reported Bitcoin holdings ranging from $15,001 to $50,000, invested through Bitwise. Bitwise is known for its crypto index funds, suggesting an interest in diversified crypto exposure. Pete Hegseth (Defense Secretary): Disclosed Bitcoin holdings valued between $15,001 and $50,000. The disclosure doesn‚Äôt specify the platform, but it places him in a similar investment bracket as Gabbard and Vought. Scott Bessent (Treasury Secretary): Revealed a significant cryptocurrency investment in Bitcoin worth between $250,001 and $500,000, held via BlackRock. BlackRock‚Äôs involvement further underscores the increasing institutional interest in Bitcoin, as BlackRock is a leading global investment management corporation. Sean Duffy (Transportation Secretary): Reported the most substantial Bitcoin holdings among the group, ranging from $550,000 to $1,100,000. His investments are diversified across Gemini and Fidelity, indicating a multi-platform approach to managing his crypto assets. Financial Disclosure Details: More Than Just Bitcoin? While Bitcoin is the cryptocurrency specifically mentioned in these financial disclosure reports, it‚Äôs important to consider the broader context. These disclosures are mandated to ensure transparency and identify potential conflicts of interest. The fact that these former government officials are reporting cryptocurrency investment at all signifies a level of seriousness and compliance. It‚Äôs also plausible that some may hold other cryptocurrencies not explicitly detailed in the reports, focusing on Bitcoin as the most prominent and widely recognized digital asset. The varying levels of investment, from Vought‚Äôs modest entry to Duffy‚Äôs substantial portfolio, suggest different risk appetites and investment strategies among these individuals. Some might be cautiously exploring the space, while others are embracing it more wholeheartedly. The use of diverse platforms like Coinbase, Gemini, Fidelity, Bitwise, and BlackRock also points to the evolving infrastructure supporting cryptocurrency investment , catering to different investor profiles and preferences. What Does This Mean for Bitcoin Adoption? The disclosure of Bitcoin holdings by these influential figures can be interpreted as a positive signal for Bitcoin adoption. When individuals who have served at the highest levels of government are comfortable investing in Bitcoin, it can help to normalize and legitimize the asset class in the eyes of the public and other institutions. This visibility can contribute to: Increased Mainstream Awareness: News of prominent figures investing in Bitcoin can pique the interest of individuals who might have previously been skeptical or unaware of cryptocurrencies. Institutional Confidence: The involvement of established financial institutions like Fidelity and BlackRock in facilitating these investments further builds institutional confidence in Bitcoin as a viable asset. Policy Discussions: This development could also influence future policy discussions around cryptocurrency regulation and adoption, as policymakers become increasingly aware of the prevalence of crypto investments even within their own ranks. However, it‚Äôs crucial to maintain a balanced perspective. While this news is undoubtedly noteworthy, it doesn‚Äôt automatically translate to widespread, unhindered Bitcoin adoption. Regulatory uncertainties, market volatility, and public perception challenges still remain. Nevertheless, the cryptocurrency investment trend among these former government officials offers a compelling data point in the ongoing narrative of Bitcoin‚Äôs journey towards mainstream acceptance. Conclusion: A Glimpse into the Future of Finance? The revelation of Bitcoin holdings within Trump‚Äôs former cabinet provides a fascinating snapshot of the evolving financial landscape. It suggests that even within traditional power structures, there‚Äôs a growing recognition and acceptance of digital assets like Bitcoin. Whether this trend will accelerate Bitcoin‚Äôs path to becoming a mainstream asset remains to be seen. However, it undeniably adds another layer of intrigue and legitimacy to the ongoing crypto narrative, signaling that cryptocurrency investment is no longer confined to the fringes of finance but is increasingly becoming a topic of discussion and participation even among the most established figures in society.

Are you prepared for the potential shifts in this key currency pair? A prominent market analyst has issued a compelling forecast, suggesting that the British Pound versus the US Dollar might experience a notable dip before staging a year-end rally. This prediction could present both challenges and strategic opportunities for traders. Let‚Äôs delve into the specifics of this GBP/USD forecast and understand what it means for your trading strategy. Why the Anticipated Dip in GBP/USD? Before we get into the potential rally, it‚Äôs crucial to understand the factors that might contribute to the predicted dip in the British Pound against the US Dollar . Several macroeconomic elements and market sentiments are currently at play. Here‚Äôs a breakdown: Economic Slowdown Concerns: Global economic growth is facing headwinds, and concerns about a potential slowdown, particularly in the UK, are weighing on the British Pound. Recent economic data releases, including weaker-than-expected manufacturing and services PMI figures, have fueled these worries. Interest Rate Differentials: The monetary policy stances of the Bank of England (BoE) and the Federal Reserve (Fed) play a significant role in currency valuations. If the market perceives the Fed as being more hawkish (inclined to raise interest rates further or keep them higher for longer) than the BoE, it can strengthen the US Dollar relative to the Pound. Geopolitical Uncertainty: Global geopolitical events always inject volatility into currency markets. Any escalation in international tensions or unexpected political developments can trigger risk-off sentiment, often benefiting the US Dollar as a safe-haven currency. Technical Indicators: From a technical analysis perspective, certain chart patterns and indicators might be suggesting a short-term bearish outlook for GBP/USD. Analysts often look at moving averages, trend lines, and oscillators to identify potential turning points in price action. It‚Äôs important to note that these factors are interconnected and can influence each other. The analyst‚Äôs GBP/USD forecast likely considers a combination of these elements to arrive at the prediction of a near-term dip. What Could Trigger a Year-End Rally for GBP/USD? While a dip is anticipated, the forecast also points towards a potential year-end rally. What could drive this positive turnaround for the British Pound against the US Dollar ? Shift in Economic Outlook: If economic data from the UK starts to improve, or if global growth prospects become more optimistic, it could boost confidence in the British Pound. Positive surprises in inflation figures, employment data, or GDP growth could all contribute to a stronger Pound. BoE Policy Adjustments: Should the Bank of England signal a more hawkish stance than currently anticipated, perhaps due to persistent inflationary pressures, it could strengthen the Pound. Conversely, if the Fed becomes less hawkish or signals a potential pause or reversal in its rate hiking cycle, it could weaken the US Dollar, benefiting GBP/USD. Resolution of Geopolitical Risks: A de-escalation of geopolitical tensions or a positive resolution to ongoing conflicts could reduce risk aversion in the market. This could lead to a weakening of the safe-haven demand for the US Dollar, allowing the British Pound to recover. Seasonal Factors and Market Positioning: Currency markets can sometimes exhibit seasonal patterns. Year-end portfolio adjustments and profit-taking activities could influence currency flows. Additionally, if market participants are heavily positioned for a further decline in GBP/USD, a shift in sentiment could trigger a short squeeze, leading to a sharp rally. The potential for a year-end rally highlights the dynamic nature of the forex trading market and the importance of staying informed and adaptable. How to Navigate Potential GBP/USD Volatility? Given the analyst‚Äôs forecast of a dip followed by a rally, how should traders approach the GBP/USD pair in the coming weeks and months? Here are some actionable insights: Strategy Description Considerations Monitor Economic Data Closely Pay close attention to upcoming economic releases from both the UK and the US, including inflation, GDP, employment, and PMI figures. Economic data can be a significant driver of currency movements. Set up alerts for key releases and analyze their potential impact on GBP/USD. Track Central Bank Communications Follow speeches and statements from officials at the Bank of England and the Federal Reserve. Look for clues about future monetary policy intentions. Central bank rhetoric can provide valuable insights into the direction of interest rates and currency valuations. Utilize Technical Analysis Employ technical analysis tools and techniques to identify potential support and resistance levels, chart patterns, and momentum shifts in GBP/USD. Technical analysis can help you identify entry and exit points and manage risk. Manage Risk Prudently Given the potential for volatility, ensure you are using appropriate risk management techniques, such as setting stop-loss orders and managing position sizes. Protecting your capital is paramount, especially in uncertain market conditions. Stay Informed on Geopolitical Events Keep abreast of global geopolitical developments that could impact market sentiment and currency flows. Unexpected geopolitical events can trigger sharp and sudden movements in currency markets. The Allure of Forex Trading: Opportunities and Challenges Forex trading , with pairs like GBP/USD, presents a world of opportunities but also comes with its set of challenges. The potential for high leverage, 24/5 market access, and significant price movements can be alluring. However, it‚Äôs crucial to be aware of the inherent risks: Volatility: Currency markets can be highly volatile, influenced by a multitude of factors. This volatility can lead to both profit opportunities and substantial losses. Leverage Risk: While leverage can amplify gains, it can also magnify losses. Using leverage responsibly and understanding its implications is essential. Market Complexity: Forex markets are complex and require a good understanding of macroeconomic factors, geopolitical events, and technical analysis. Continuous learning and adaptation are key to success. Emotional Discipline: Trading decisions should be based on rational analysis, not emotions. Fear and greed can lead to impulsive and potentially costly mistakes. Despite these challenges, the potential rewards of successful forex trading are undeniable. By staying informed, developing a sound trading strategy, and managing risk effectively, traders can navigate the complexities of the currency markets and potentially capitalize on opportunities like the anticipated GBP/USD year-end rally. Conclusion: Prepare for Potential GBP/USD Shifts The analyst‚Äôs year-end rally forecast for GBP/USD presents a fascinating outlook for forex traders. While a short-term dip is predicted, the potential for a subsequent rally offers strategic opportunities. By understanding the underlying factors driving these forecasts and implementing prudent trading strategies, you can position yourself to navigate the potential volatility and capitalize on market movements. Keep a close watch on economic data, central bank signals, and global events to stay ahead in the dynamic world of forex trading. The GBP/USD pair is poised for potentially significant movements, and being prepared is your best advantage.

While most forecasts remain optimistic, on-chain metrics show a decline in user activity, which could slow the asset‚Äôs momentum. XRP Shows a ‚ÄòGreat Sign of Strength‚Äô The past few weeks have been quite eventful for the cryptocurrency market, which endured substantial turbulence. Ripple‚Äôs XRP was not excluded from the volatility, with its price tanking to a local low below $2 on March 11 and later heading north to the current $2.28 (per CoinGecko‚Äôs data), representing a 3.5% increase on a daily scale. XRP Price, Source: CoinGecko According to some analysts, the asset has yet to show its potential during this cycle. The X user Crypto General recently told their 230,000 followers that XRP has been holding above the breakout level of $0.94, describing the development as ‚Äúa great sign of strength.‚Äù The market observer also said that the price has retested the support levels and seems ready for the next move to the upside. ‚ÄúMy target for the short term would be around $9. But overall, I am even more bullish, being a USA project and all the cases by SEC have been taken back , it is bound to pump hard,‚Äù they stated. Recall that the US Securities and Exchange Commission recently dropped or dismissed multiple lawsuits against crypto businesses. While the lawsuit versus Ripple remains ongoing, some experts suggested a resolution might occur in the following weeks. CRYPTOWZRD also chipped in, albeit making a less bullish forecast. The analyst claimed that XRP closed its latest daily candle slightly bullish as XRP/BTC ‚Äúalso pushed higher.‚Äù ‚ÄúWe should see more bullish movement from XRP/BTC, which should help XRP get an impulsive upside move towards the $2.80 resistance target, with $2.05 being the main support target,‚Äù they added. Traders, Beware of This Signal The X user Ali Martinez was not so optimistic about XRP‚Äôs price performance in the near future . He warned traders that the TD Sequential flashed a sell signal on the 4-hour chart, indicating a possible wave of profit-taking. Additionally, numerous XRP-related on-chain metrics have headed south in the past 24 hours. Those include the number of payments from one account to another, the number of active accounts, the number of executed transactions, and more. This decline hints at reduced user engagement and lower network adoption, which, in turn, could trigger a downward pressure on the valuation.

""A new testnet, Hooli, is going live Monday to wrap up Pectra testing,"" said Tim Beiko, who coordinates the ecosystem's core developers at the Ethereum Foundation, in an X post following a developer call on Thursday. Pectra will be tested on Hooli on Wednesday, March 26 ‚Äî when the test chain will be upgraded to the new version of Ethereum and evaluated for performance and stability. Pectra includes several code changes designed to make Ethereum faster, more efficient, and more user-friendly for both users and developers. One of the most significant improvements adds ""smart contract"" functionality to addresses, allowing user wallets to be programmed with new features, such as the ability to pay transaction fees in currencies other than ETH. If the Hooli test succeeds, Beiko said developers will launch the upgrade after approximately 30 days, subject to further testing. Should everything proceed as planned, Ethereum users can expect Pectra to reach the ecosystem's main network in late April or early May. The Hooli testnet was created following complications with Pectra tests on Sepolia and Holesky, Ethereum's primary test networks. In both instances, configuration errors prevented proper testing of the Pectra upgrade. In Holesky's case, the network was offline for multiple weeks due to the flawed test issues. Test networks like Holesky, Sepolia, and Hooli function almost identically to the main Ethereum network but are generally free to use and not intended to support real value. Major upgrades like Pectra are typically implemented on Ethereum's test networks before full deployment on the mainnet, as any disruptions on the actual Ethereum network could be extremely costly. According to Beiko, Sepolia and Holesky ‚Äî which are now running Pectra successfully ‚Äî serve different testing purposes. ""If you need to test validator exits, be on the lookout for [Hooli]! Everything else can be tested on Sepolia & Holesky,"" Beiko stated in his Thursday post on X. Pectra's technical setbacks come during a challenging period for Ethereum. The network has faced mounting pressure from declining ETH prices, leadership transitions at the Ethereum Foundation, and growing skepticism about its ability to maintain market dominance amid competition from newer blockchains like Solana. Industry figures view the successful implementation of Pectra as crucial for restoring confidence in Ethereum's technical roadmap.",Tech,EN,0,0,ETH|MARKET|TRADING|SOL,"{'name': 'CoinDesk', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coindesk.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coindesk,2025-03-13 19:13:03

His arrest comes after an indictment unsealed by the US Department of Justice (DOJ) on March 7. The DOJ‚Äôs indictment charges Besciokov and his co-founder, 40-year-old Aleksandr Mira Serda, a Russian national residing in the United Arab Emirates, with conspiracy to commit money laundering. Related Reading: This Is The Last Opportunity To Buy Dogecoin ‚ÄòRelatively Cheap,‚Äô Predicts Analyst Garantex, which launched in 2019, was sanctioned by the US Treasury‚Äôs Office of Foreign Assets Control in April 2022 for its role in facilitating the movement of criminal proceeds. Reports indicate that the exchange has processed over $60 billion since sanctions were imposed, raising significant concerns regarding its operations. According to the blockchain analysis firm Elliptic, Garantex has been involved in various forms of unlawful activity, including facilitating ransomware attacks, drug trafficking, and evading sanctions imposed on Russian elites. The firm noted that the exchange has enabled Russian oligarchs to transfer their wealth abroad, particularly following the invasion of Ukraine. DOJ Alleges Garantex Co-Founder Operated Under Hacker Alias ‚ÄúProforg‚Äù The US Department of Justice also alleges that Besciokov served as Garantex‚Äôs primary technical administrator, responsible for maintaining critical infrastructure and approving transactions. In conjunction with the indictment, German and Finnish law enforcement agencies seized servers that hosted Garantex‚Äôs operations, and US authorities have frozen over $26 million linked to the exchange‚Äôs money laundering activities. In a notable twist, Besciokov is said to have operated under the hacker handle ‚Äúproforg,‚Äù a nickname associated with a long-running Russian-language forum known for its explicit content. The charges against him include conspiracy to violate the International Economic Emergency Powers Act, which carries a maximum sentence of 20 years in prison, and conspiracy to operate an unlicensed money transmitting business, which could lead to an additional five years of imprisonment.

That‚Äôs the power of Qubetics‚Äô interoperability‚Äîbridging the gap between blockchains so crypto can actually work the way it was always meant to. Conclusion: Top Altcoin for Massive Return Potential Crypto doesn‚Äôt wait for anyone. Toncoin already made its move, and those who hesitated are now watching from the sidelines.

41605526,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=139891,1741893644,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Explosive News: Franklin Templeton Files Groundbreaking XRP ETF Application!,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/franklin-templeton-xrp-etf/,"Hold onto your hats, crypto enthusiasts! The winds of change are blowing stronger than ever, and this time, it involves a financial titan making a significant leap into the XRP arena. Global asset management behemoth, Franklin Templeton, has just thrown its hat into the ring, filing an application for a spot XRP ETF with the Chicago Board Options Exchange (CBOE). This electrifying development, first spotted by Solid Intel on X, signals a potential paradigm shift for XRP and the broader cryptocurrency investment landscape. Are we on the cusp of a new era for XRP adoption? Let‚Äôs dive deep into what this groundbreaking news could mean for you and the crypto market. Why is a Franklin Templeton XRP ETF Application a Big Deal? Franklin Templeton isn‚Äôt just any name in the finance world; we‚Äôre talking about a global powerhouse managing trillions of dollars in assets. Their move to file for an XRP ETF is a seismic event, sending ripples of excitement and anticipation throughout the crypto community. But why all the buzz? Let‚Äôs break it down: Legitimacy and Mainstream Adoption: When established financial institutions like Franklin Templeton enter the crypto space, it lends a significant degree of legitimacy to the asset class. An XRP ETF from such a respected firm could pave the way for increased mainstream adoption, drawing in institutional and retail investors who were previously hesitant to directly engage with XRP. Increased Accessibility: ETFs are designed for ease of access. An XRP ETF would allow investors to gain exposure to XRP without the complexities of directly purchasing and storing the cryptocurrency. This simplified approach could open the floodgates to a wider range of investors, including those in traditional markets who prefer regulated and familiar investment vehicles. Potential for Price Appreciation: Increased demand typically leads to price appreciation. If an XRP ETF attracts substantial investment, it could significantly boost the demand for XRP, potentially driving up its price. This is a key factor fueling the current excitement surrounding this news. Validation for XRP: Despite its long history and strong community, XRP has faced regulatory hurdles and market skepticism. A Franklin Templeton XRP ETF could be seen as a major validation for XRP, signaling to the market that a major financial institution sees long-term value and potential in the digital asset. What is a Crypto ETF and Why Does it Matter for XRP? For those new to the ETF world, let‚Äôs quickly demystify what a Crypto ETF actually is and why it‚Äôs such a game-changer for digital assets like XRP. An Exchange Traded Fund (ETF) is essentially a type of investment fund that trades on stock exchanges, much like individual stocks. A Crypto ETF specifically holds cryptocurrencies or cryptocurrency-related assets. Instead of directly buying and managing XRP, investors can buy shares of an XRP ETF. The ETF provider then holds the underlying XRP, managing custody and security, while investors benefit from price movements of XRP without the technical complexities. Why is this crucial for XRP? Currently, investing in XRP directly can be daunting for some. It involves: Setting up cryptocurrency exchange accounts. Understanding private keys and wallet security. Navigating the often-complex landscape of crypto regulations. An XRP ETF removes these barriers. It provides a regulated, familiar, and accessible pathway for investors to participate in the XRP market through traditional brokerage accounts. This ease of access is a powerful catalyst for broader adoption and investment. Franklin Templeton ETF: A Closer Look at the Applicant Let‚Äôs take a moment to understand why Franklin Templeton‚Äôs involvement is particularly noteworthy. This isn‚Äôt a newcomer dipping its toes into crypto; it‚Äôs a seasoned financial giant with a long and respected history. Here‚Äôs a quick snapshot: Feature Franklin Templeton Founded 1947 Assets Under Management (AUM) Trillions of Dollars Globally Reputation Globally Recognized and Respected Asset Manager ETF Expertise Extensive Experience in Launching and Managing ETFs Across Various Asset Classes Crypto Interest Increasingly Active in the Digital Asset Space, Exploring Various Crypto Products Franklin Templeton‚Äôs deep expertise in ETFs, combined with their growing interest in digital assets, makes them a formidable applicant for an XRP ETF . Their reputation and track record instill confidence in investors and regulators alike. CBOE and the XRP ETF: What‚Äôs the Chicago Board Options Exchange‚Äôs Role? The Chicago Board Options Exchange (CBOE) is the proposed listing venue for the Franklin Templeton XRP ETF. Why CBOE? And what does this mean for the ETF‚Äôs prospects? CBOE is a leading global exchange known for its innovation and willingness to embrace new financial products. It was also one of the first exchanges to list Bitcoin futures and, more recently, Bitcoin ETFs. Choosing CBOE as the listing exchange signals a strategic move towards a platform that is familiar with and supportive of cryptocurrency-related investment products. Key takeaways about CBOE‚Äôs role: Experienced in Crypto Listings: CBOE has a proven track record of listing crypto-related products, suggesting a smoother regulatory review process compared to exchanges less familiar with digital assets. Investor Access: Listing on CBOE provides broad access to a large pool of investors who are already accustomed to trading on this exchange. Market Visibility: CBOE‚Äôs prominence in the financial world enhances the visibility and credibility of the proposed XRP ETF. The CBOE‚Äôs involvement further strengthens the bullish case for the Franklin Templeton XRP ETF, indicating a well-thought-out and strategic approach to bringing this product to market. Institutional Investment in XRP: Is This the Tipping Point? The potential approval of a Franklin Templeton XRP ETF could be a pivotal moment for Institutional Investment in XRP. For years, institutional investors have been cautiously exploring the crypto space, often citing regulatory uncertainty and custody concerns as major hurdles. An XRP ETF could address many of these concerns. How an XRP ETF encourages institutional investment: Regulatory Clarity (Sort Of): While the regulatory landscape is still evolving, an ETF, especially one from a firm like Franklin Templeton, suggests a level of regulatory comfort, or at least a calculated risk assessment. Simplified Custody: Institutions don‚Äôt have to worry about directly holding and securing XRP. The ETF provider takes on this responsibility. Familiar Investment Structure: ETFs are a well-understood investment vehicle for institutions. Integrating an XRP ETF into their portfolios is a straightforward process compared to establishing direct crypto holdings. Portfolio Diversification: Institutions are always looking for diversification opportunities. XRP, with its unique use cases and potential, offers a compelling diversification asset, and an ETF makes it easier to incorporate. If approved, the Franklin Templeton XRP ETF could be the catalyst that unlocks significant institutional capital flows into XRP, potentially transforming its market dynamics. Navigating the Challenges: Will the XRP ETF Get Approved? While the Franklin Templeton XRP ETF application is undeniably exciting, it‚Äôs crucial to acknowledge that the road to approval isn‚Äôt guaranteed to be smooth. Several challenges lie ahead: Regulatory Scrutiny: ETFs, especially crypto ETFs, face rigorous regulatory review. Securities regulators will scrutinize every aspect of the application, from custody arrangements to market surveillance, to ensure investor protection. Market Volatility: The inherent volatility of the cryptocurrency market can be a concern for regulators when considering ETF approvals. They need to be satisfied that mechanisms are in place to manage and mitigate risks associated with volatility. XRP‚Äôs Regulatory History: XRP has had a complex regulatory history, including a lawsuit with the SEC (partially resolved). While recent developments have been positive, regulators will likely proceed with caution and conduct thorough due diligence. Competition: The ETF market is competitive. Franklin Templeton‚Äôs application will be evaluated alongside other potential and existing crypto ETF offerings. Despite these challenges, the fact that a firm of Franklin Templeton‚Äôs stature is pursuing an XRP ETF is a strong positive signal. It suggests they believe the regulatory landscape is becoming more favorable and that the potential rewards outweigh the risks. What‚Äôs Next? Actionable Insights for Crypto Investors So, what should you do with this explosive news? Here are some actionable insights: Stay Informed: Keep a close watch on developments related to the Franklin Templeton XRP ETF application. News outlets, crypto news sites, and social media channels like X (formerly Twitter) are good sources of information. Do Your Research: Don‚Äôt make investment decisions based solely on hype. Conduct thorough research on XRP, Franklin Templeton, and the broader crypto ETF landscape. Understand the risks and potential rewards. Consider XRP Exposure (Responsibly): If you believe in the long-term potential of XRP and the positive impact of an ETF, consider whether adding XRP to your portfolio aligns with your investment strategy and risk tolerance. Remember, crypto investments are inherently volatile, so invest responsibly. Watch for Regulatory Signals: Pay attention to any statements or actions from regulatory bodies regarding crypto ETFs and XRP. Regulatory clarity is a crucial factor in the success of these products.

Franklin Templeton‚Äôs XRP ETF application is more than just another filing; it‚Äôs a potential landmark moment for XRP and the evolution of Crypto ETFs . It signifies growing institutional acceptance of XRP, a move towards greater accessibility for investors, and a potential catalyst for significant market growth. While regulatory hurdles and market volatility remain factors to consider, the entry of a financial giant like Franklin Templeton into the XRP ETF arena is an undeniably bullish signal. The crypto world is watching with bated breath to see if this application will pave the way for a new era of mainstream XRP investment and further legitimize the crypto ETF market as a whole.

Leaning on its Volatility Index (VI) trend recently, there is growing concern about whether the BTC price will drop below the $70,000 psychological support zone. Since the start of the month, the market has been unstable, triggering more sell-offs in risk-on assets. With direct correlation with the stock market, Bitcoin price has lost 14.35% of its value Year-to-Date (YTD). Bitcoin Price and Source of Fluctuation At the time of writing, the BTC price changed hands for $80,846.20, down by 2.05% in 24 hours. The coin dropped from a high of $84,301.69 to as low as $79,931.85. The Bitcoin price trend has recovered after it touched its 24-hour low. Bitcoin volatility was showcased as it suddenly dropped from $82,840.94 to $79,931. Notably, the market rout followed false news regarding the Trump family and Binance. The Wall Street Journal (WSJ) reported that the Trump family wanted a minority stake in Binance US . While the news was almost fueling a boost in the market, the exchange‚Äôs founder, Changpeng ‚ÄòCZ‚Äô Zhao, denounced the Trump-Binance alliance, further triggering market volatility. Is BTC Price at Risk of Further Drop? Throughout this month, Bitcoin has recorded a number of sharp selloffs. Most of these declines were triggered by macroeconomic trends bordering on President Donald Trump‚Äôs induced trade war. Data from Bitbo show the Bitcoin Volatility Index at 2.75, the highest level over the past six months. This high VI implies that the price of BTC may record a very sharp, unannounced drop. However, the mix of positive updates in the ecosystem is likely to boost BTC‚Äôs resilience moving forward. Bitcoin Volatility Index. Source: Bitbo Despite the $15.59% increase in the past 30 days, the coin‚Äôs price has never dropped below the $70,000 support line. If this trend is sustained, BTC may resist further selloffs. Bitcoin Reserve Sentiment Stays It is worth noting that the strategic Bitcoin reserve update from earlier in the month has failed to ignite a massive rally in the coin‚Äôs price. The initial investor disappointment came when no new funds were allocated to buy the coin for the reserve. However, Senator Cynthia Lummis‚Äôs reintroduction of the Bitcoin Act Bill is poised to change investors‚Äô perceptions soon. If passed by the legislature, it might create a primary basis for betting on the coin in the long term. With the long-term prospect of Bitcoin, market leaders have reiterated their price target for the coin.

To read full editions, subscribe . The law of unintended consequences is a premise in social sciences that shines a light on the outcomes of a purposeful ‚Äî but not intended or foreseen ‚Äî action. As I think through the second and third order effects of Trump‚Äôs policies thus far, this notion feels increasingly crucial to consider. In a recent op-ed in the Wall Street Journal, Bridgewater Associates CIO Greg Jensen claimed that ‚Äúit‚Äôs a dangerous time to be overexposed to US assets, and almost everyone is.‚Äù Jensen is right. Heading into 2025, nearly all of Wall Street was on board for the US exceptionalism trade and the idea of hiding out in Mag 7 stocks: As we begin to unpack the effects of Trump‚Äôs trade policies , I‚Äôm starting to see a major recalibration of global capital flows unfold that I don‚Äôt think was fully anticipated by the president and his team. If you compare the MSCI USA index to MSCI World, we can see how, over the past couple of years, the US surged higher ‚Äî driven by outsized fiscal deficits ‚Äî¬†while the rest of the world was experiencing a despondent economy. However, since Trump began his trade policy dealmaking and pursuit of lower deficits, this ratio has been falling apart: Let‚Äôs unpack what‚Äôs driving this by looking at some of the major economies and how they‚Äôre evolving. Comparing cross-border economic surprise indexes is a great way to examine which direction economies are trending, as they measure in real-time whether economic data is surprising to the upside/downside. For the past couple of years, most economies have been in sync. But a major divergence is unfolding, with the US surprising lower and other countries surprising higher: Adding to that, Trump‚Äôs threats of tariffs have awoken the fiscal beast in many countries, namely across Europe. As seen in this chart from my recent interview with Vincent Deluard, in the face of Trump‚Äôs threats to stop supporting the NATO security apparatus, Germany now plans to invest $500 billion into its defence and infrastructure ‚Äî¬†a development that sent Bund yields soaring: This led to a surge in the euro/USD to 1.088 and a mirrored decline in the USD. This was a fiscal unshackling moment by the country that has been at the forefront of pursuing austerity. This reversal has sent Europe stocks soaring as capital flows out of US stocks and into European equities. In Japan, the theme of surging yields is similar. The Japanese 30-year bond yield just surged to a 20 year high: As yields in countries that have predominantly moved capital into US bonds and equities continue to rise, it puts pressure on the calculus that makes owning US assets worth it ‚Äî¬†turning them into net-sellers as global capital flows back home. This is why Jensen, as CIO of the world‚Äôs largest hedge fund, says it‚Äôs a dangerous time to be overexposed to US assets. The marginal buyers of the last 30 years are becoming marginal sellers as capital becomes more attractive back home, largely catalyzed by Trump‚Äôs policies. I believe this trend in global capital flows is only just beginning. Yes, a lot of big moves have already occurred across the board, but the big money cannot shift in just a few weeks.

41605944,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=139892,1741894240,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,"Urgent Warning: Warren Slams GENIUS Act, Claiming Stablecoin Bill Fuels Illicit Crypto Use",https://bitcoinworld.co.in/warren-slams-stablecoin-bill/,"Hold onto your hats, crypto enthusiasts! Senator Elizabeth Warren, a known critic of the digital currency world, is raising serious alarms about a new stablecoin bill making its way through the U.S. legislative process. Dubbed the GENIUS Act, this proposed legislation is intended to regulate stablecoins, but Warren and her team believe it could inadvertently open the floodgates to illicit activities. Let‚Äôs dive into the details and see what the fuss is all about. Decoding the GENIUS Act: A Stablecoin Bill Under Fire The GENIUS Act, or as it‚Äôs formally known, the ‚ÄúClarity for Payment Stablecoins Act,‚Äù aims to establish a regulatory framework for stablecoins ‚Äì cryptocurrencies pegged to a stable asset like the U.S. dollar. The intention behind such legislation is often to bring clarity and legitimacy to the burgeoning stablecoin market, potentially fostering innovation and wider adoption. However, Senator Warren‚Äôs recent memo, as reported by Fortune, paints a drastically different picture. According to Warren‚Äôs staff memo, the core issue lies in the potential for this stablecoin bill to become a breeding ground for illegal financial behavior. The memo specifically points to concerns about: Sanctions Evasion: Critics argue the bill‚Äôs provisions could be exploited to bypass international sanctions, allowing bad actors to move funds undetected. Lack of Consumer Protection: Despite aiming for regulation, the memo suggests the bill may fall short in safeguarding consumer funds held in stablecoins, leaving users vulnerable. Economic Destabilization: Concerns are raised that this stablecoin bill , in its current form, could introduce instability into the broader U.S. economy. Big Tech Influence: The legislation might inadvertently empower large tech corporations, even those like Elon Musk‚Äôs X (formerly Twitter), granting them significant influence in the financial space through stablecoin adoption. Money Laundering and Terrorist Financing: A key criticism is the perceived inadequacy of safeguards against money laundering and the financing of terrorism within the proposed framework. Senator Warren‚Äôs stance is clear: she believes this stablecoin bill , instead of curbing risks, might actually amplify them. But is there any merit to these claims? Let‚Äôs explore the potential challenges and implications in more detail. Why is Senator Warren so concerned about illicit activity and the GENIUS Act? Senator Warren has consistently voiced skepticism and outright opposition to cryptocurrency in general, citing concerns ranging from consumer protection to financial stability. Her apprehension regarding the GENIUS Act seems to stem from a fundamental belief that the bill prioritizes industry interests over robust regulation and public safety. One of the central arguments in her memo revolves around the potential for increased illicit activity . Cryptocurrencies, particularly stablecoins due to their intended stability and ease of transfer, have been flagged by law enforcement agencies as tools for money laundering, sanctions evasion, and other illegal financial operations. Warren‚Äôs team argues that the GENIUS Act , in its current form, might not have sufficient teeth to prevent these illicit uses. Critics suggest loopholes or vaguely defined provisions within the bill could be exploited by criminals seeking to operate within the crypto space while evading traditional financial controls. Furthermore, the Senator‚Äôs concerns about consumer protection are paramount. The memo questions whether the bill truly ensures the safety and security of consumer funds invested in stablecoins. In the volatile world of crypto, where collapses and scams are not uncommon, robust consumer protection is crucial for mainstream adoption and maintaining public trust. Could the GENIUS Act really empower Big Tech and destabilize the economy? The notion that the GENIUS Act could inadvertently empower Big Tech giants like Elon Musk‚Äôs X raises some intriguing questions. The crypto space is already witnessing increasing involvement from major tech players, and stablecoins could be a key avenue for further integration. Imagine a scenario where platforms like X, with their massive user base, seamlessly integrate stablecoin payments. This could grant them unprecedented influence in the financial landscape, potentially bypassing traditional financial institutions. While proponents might argue this fosters innovation and efficiency, critics like Warren fear it concentrates power in the hands of a few tech conglomerates, with potentially destabilizing consequences for the broader economy. Economic destabilization is another significant concern raised in the memo. If stablecoins, facilitated by legislation like the GENIUS Act , grow rapidly without adequate regulatory oversight, they could pose systemic risks to the financial system. A sudden collapse or loss of confidence in a major stablecoin could trigger ripple effects across the market, potentially impacting traditional financial sectors as well. Is there any hope for a balanced approach to crypto regulation? Despite Senator Warren‚Äôs strong criticism, the debate surrounding the stablecoin bill and crypto regulation is far from over. There‚Äôs a clear need for a balanced approach ‚Äì one that fosters innovation and responsible growth in the crypto space while simultaneously mitigating risks and protecting consumers. Here are some key aspects to consider when moving forward with crypto regulation: Stronger Anti-Money Laundering (AML) and Combating the Financing of Terrorism (CFT) Measures: Any crypto regulation , especially concerning stablecoins, must incorporate robust AML and CFT frameworks that are effectively enforced. This includes clear KYC (Know Your Customer) and transaction monitoring requirements. Consumer Protection is Paramount: Regulations should prioritize the safety and security of consumer funds. This may involve stricter reserve requirements for stablecoin issuers, clear disclosure obligations, and mechanisms for consumer redress in case of issues. Inter-Agency Collaboration: Effective crypto regulation requires collaboration between various government agencies, including financial regulators, law enforcement, and consumer protection agencies. A coordinated approach is crucial to address the multifaceted challenges posed by crypto. International Cooperation: Given the global nature of cryptocurrencies, international cooperation is essential to prevent regulatory arbitrage and ensure consistent standards across jurisdictions. Innovation-Friendly Framework: While regulation is necessary, it shouldn‚Äôt stifle innovation. A balanced approach should aim to create a clear and predictable regulatory environment that encourages responsible innovation within the crypto space. Finding this balance is a complex challenge, but it‚Äôs crucial for harnessing the potential benefits of cryptocurrencies while mitigating their inherent risks. The ongoing debate around the GENIUS Act and Senator Warren‚Äôs critique highlight the urgency and importance of getting crypto regulation right. Actionable Insights: What does this mean for you? For crypto users and investors, Senator Warren‚Äôs concerns serve as a warning to remain vigilant. While the GENIUS Act is still under discussion, it underscores the evolving regulatory landscape of the crypto world. Here are some actionable insights: Stay Informed: Keep abreast of developments in crypto regulation, including the progress of bills like the GENIUS Act. Understanding the regulatory environment is crucial for navigating the crypto space safely. Exercise Caution with Stablecoins: While stablecoins aim for stability, they are not without risks. Do your research and understand the reserves and regulatory compliance of any stablecoin you use. Advocate for Responsible Regulation: Engage in discussions about crypto regulation and advocate for balanced approaches that protect consumers and foster innovation. Your voice matters in shaping the future of crypto. Diversify Your Holdings: As always in the crypto world, diversification is key. Don‚Äôt put all your eggs in one basket, especially given the regulatory uncertainties. Conclusion: Navigating the Uncertain Waters of Stablecoin Regulation Senator Warren‚Äôs critique of the GENIUS Act throws a spotlight on the inherent tensions in regulating the rapidly evolving world of cryptocurrencies, particularly stablecoins. While the intention behind the bill may be to bring clarity and structure, concerns about illicit activity , consumer protection, and economic stability are valid and warrant serious consideration. The path forward requires a nuanced and balanced approach ‚Äì one that embraces innovation while prioritizing responsible growth and safeguarding against potential risks. The debate around the GENIUS Act is a crucial step in this ongoing journey to define the future of crypto regulation.

USDC figures: $58.4 billion and 24.7% respectively. Most USDT issued on Ethereum, at $75.9 billion; slightly fewer coins on Tron ($63.7 billion); Solana, $2 billion. Despite lagging significantly behind the flagship, USDC is showing impressive momentum. According to the observations of CryptoRank , the total supply of the second most capitalized stablecoin has increased by 32%. The Solana platform's share of the segment is also increasing. ‚ÄùSince the beginning of the year, the supply of stablecoins in the Solana network has grown from $5 billion to $11.8 billion. The main share is occupied by USDC - $9.2 billion, which resembles the situation in the¬†Base¬†network, where this coin also dominates and accounts for 92% of the total volume,‚Äù experts noted. A Universal Buy The Dip Is Coming? Santiment analysts recorded a surge in onchain activity - on March 11, the number of USDT transfers reached a six-month high. ‚ÄùWhen activity with USDT and other stablecoins grows amid falling prices, it is a signal: traders are preparing to buy. Additional pressure from buyers contributes to the recovery of quotations,‚Äù experts explained. A similar opinion in conversation with Cointelegraph said CEO¬†of Kronos Research Vincent Liu. He noted that traders often accumulate Tether stablecoin during market downturns to prepare for new entry points.

According to prosecutors, Andrade, 47, misled investors by falsely claiming that AML Bitcoin had advanced anti-money laundering technology and was nearing adoption by the Panama Canal Authority.

Recently, a particularly intriguing narrative unfolded as blockchain monitoring service, Whale Alert, flagged a colossal XRP transfer . A staggering 200,000,000 XRP tokens, originating from Ripple, were moved to an unknown wallet. Valued at approximately $458 million, this substantial movement has ignited discussions and speculation within the crypto community. What does this mean for XRP and the broader crypto landscape? Let‚Äôs dive into the details of this significant event. Decoding the Massive XRP Transfer: What We Know On {{insert date}}, Whale Alert, a prominent service that tracks large cryptocurrency transactions, reported the movement of 200,000,000 XRP. This wasn‚Äôt just any ordinary transaction; it involved a transfer directly from Ripple, the company heavily associated with XRP, to a wallet whose owner remains unidentified. Here‚Äôs a breakdown of the key facts: Amount Transferred: 200,000,000 XRP Origin Wallet: Ripple Destination Wallet: Unknown Wallet Reported By: Whale Alert Estimated Value: Approximately $458 million (at the time of transaction) The sheer scale of this XRP transfer is noteworthy. Transactions of this magnitude often trigger curiosity and raise questions about the intentions behind them. In the crypto world, large transfers, especially those involving major players like Ripple, are closely watched for potential market implications. Ripple XRP and Whale Transactions: Why Does It Matter? Ripple holds a significant amount of XRP. These holdings are periodically used for various purposes, including operational expenses, strategic investments, and distributions. However, any substantial movement of Ripple XRP , particularly to an unknown entity, can spark debate and analysis. Why? Market Sentiment: Large transfers can sometimes influence market sentiment. Traders and investors often analyze whale movements to gauge potential shifts in supply and demand. Potential Selling Pressure: If the recipient of these XRP tokens decides to sell them on the open market, it could potentially increase selling pressure, impacting the price of XRP. Strategic Moves: Conversely, such transfers could also be part of a strategic move by Ripple, such as institutional partnerships, OTC (over-the-counter) deals, or other undisclosed plans. Transparency Concerns: Transfers to unknown wallets can sometimes raise questions about transparency within the cryptocurrency ecosystem. It‚Äôs crucial to remember that correlation doesn‚Äôt equal causation. While large XRP whale transactions are events worth noting, they are just one piece of the puzzle in understanding the complex dynamics of the cryptocurrency market. Unknown Wallets and Crypto Mysteries: Decoding the Transaction The designation of the receiving wallet as ‚Äòunknown‚Äô adds an element of mystery to this cryptocurrency news story. In the decentralized world of crypto, wallet addresses are pseudonymous. While transactions are publicly recorded on the blockchain, identifying the real-world entity behind a wallet address can be challenging, and sometimes, intentionally obscured. What could be the reasons for transferring such a large sum to an unknown wallet? Institutional Investor: It‚Äôs possible that the ‚Äòunknown wallet‚Äô belongs to a large institutional investor or a fund that prefers to remain undisclosed, at least initially. OTC Deal: The transfer could be related to an over-the-counter (OTC) trade, where large amounts of cryptocurrency are exchanged privately, away from public exchanges. Custodial Service: The recipient might be a custodial service that manages crypto assets on behalf of numerous clients, making it appear as an ‚Äòunknown‚Äô entity from a transactional perspective. Internal Ripple Reorganization: Although less likely given the ‚Äòunknown‚Äô designation, it‚Äôs theoretically possible this is an internal reorganization of Ripple‚Äôs assets across different wallets, with the destination wallet not yet publicly associated with them. Security or Privacy Measures: In some cases, using ‚Äòunknown‚Äô wallets could be a measure to enhance security or privacy, although for large public companies like Ripple, transparency is often prioritized. Without further information, the exact reason behind the XRP transfer to an unknown wallet remains speculative. The crypto community will likely continue to monitor related wallet activity for further clues. XRP News and Market Reactions: What‚Äôs Next? The immediate market reaction to such XRP news is often a mixed bag. Some traders might interpret large transfers as a sign of potential selling pressure and react negatively, while others might see it as a non-event or even a strategic move that could be beneficial in the long run. Here are some potential future scenarios and points to watch: Wallet Activity Monitoring: Keep an eye on the activity of the ‚Äòunknown wallet‚Äô. Significant outflows from this wallet to exchanges could indicate potential selling pressure. Ripple Announcements: Look out for any official announcements from Ripple regarding this transaction or related strategic developments. XRP Price Action: Monitor XRP‚Äôs price action in the coming days and weeks to see if the transfer has any discernible impact. However, remember that numerous factors influence crypto prices. Broader Market Context: Consider the broader cryptocurrency market context. Overall market sentiment and Bitcoin‚Äôs price movements often have a significant influence on altcoins like XRP. It‚Äôs important to approach such events with a balanced perspective. While cryptocurrency news like large XRP transfers can be intriguing and potentially market-moving, they are just one piece of the larger, ever-evolving crypto narrative. In the volatile world of digital assets, staying informed, doing your own research, and understanding the nuances of market dynamics are crucial. Conclusion: Unraveling the Mystery of the XRP Movement The 200,000,000 XRP transfer from Ripple to an unknown wallet is undoubtedly a noteworthy event in the crypto space. Reported by Whale Alert and valued at a substantial $458 million, this massive transaction raises several questions and sparks speculation. While the exact reasons behind this movement remain shrouded in mystery, it serves as a reminder of the dynamic and often opaque nature of cryptocurrency transactions.

A press release by Cantor Fitzgerald omitted the stablecoin issuer but its CEO says a partnership is still in play. Tether Wants To Join Cantor Fitzgerald‚Äôs Bitcoin Offering. After months of planning, financial services firm Cantor Fitzgerald announced plans to begin providing leverage for institutional investors holding Bitcoin (BTC) on their balance sheets.

In an interview with Bloomberg, Ardoino highlighted Tether‚Äôs interest in the Bitcoin lending business, stating that the partnership is the ‚Äúright thing to do.‚Äù Ardoino adds that the partnership will be mutually beneficial to both entities given their wealth of experience. The Tether CEO says Cantor Fitzgerald has relationships with all the institutional borrowers, making it an ideal partner. Furthermore, Ardoino says Tether is a ‚Äúgreat partner‚Äù given its leading position in tokenization and the Bitcoin ecosystem. ‚ÄúBitcoin lending is very interesting to us and there are huge opportunities,‚Äù said Ardoino. ‚ÄúJoining forces between Tether and Cantor Fitzgerald is the right thing to do.‚Äù The move follows Thailand‚Äôs SEC recognition of USDT as an approved cryptocurrency.

Ardoino Wants The Stablecoin Issuer To Play a Bigger Role In US Stablecoin Ambitions The Tether CEO has announced his intention to play a central role in America‚Äôs stablecoin plans. Despite being based outside the US, Ardoino says USDT is in a prime position to promote the US dollar as the global reserve currency. US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent confirmed a policy change, indicating plans by the US to turn its focus to stablecoins. While Tether wants to join the US plans, it faces stiff competition from the XRPL ledger-based RLUSD and USDC. ‚ÄúWe will keep the US the dominant reserve currency and use stablecoins to do that,‚Äù said Bennett. Ardoino noted that Tether‚Äôs base of operations outside the US does not impede its ability to promote US interests.

February delivered a chilling surprise as centralized exchange (CEX) trading volume experienced a significant nosedive. We‚Äôre diving deep into the numbers to understand what triggered this downturn and what it signals for the volatile world of cryptocurrency. Was it a temporary blip, or is this the start of a larger trend? Let‚Äôs explore the details behind this dramatic shift in the crypto market . Why Did CEX Trading Volume Plummet? According to a recent CoinDesk report, the numbers are stark: a 21% decrease in CEX trading volume in February, landing at $7.2 trillion. This marks the lowest point since October of last year. Several factors are likely at play, creating a perfect storm that dampened investor enthusiasm. Let‚Äôs break down the key contributors: Trump Tariff Tensions: Concerns surrounding potential tariffs from former U.S. President Donald Trump cast a shadow over global markets. Such uncertainties often lead investors to adopt a risk-off approach, impacting even the crypto sphere. Market Indecision: February often falls in a period of market consolidation after the year-end and before major announcements or events typically pick up in later months. This can naturally lead to reduced trading activity. Profit Taking: Following potential gains in January, some investors may have opted to take profits off the table, leading to decreased trading volume. It‚Äôs important to note that while a 21% drop is substantial, the overall centralized exchange landscape remains robust. However, this decline serves as a critical reminder of the crypto market‚Äôs sensitivity to global economic and political factors. Derivatives Trading Takes a Hit The downturn wasn‚Äôt limited to spot trading. The derivatives market, a crucial component of the crypto ecosystem, also experienced a contraction. Even the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME), a bellwether for institutional interest in crypto derivatives, saw its first volume decrease in five months. This suggests a broader cooling off across various segments of the crypto trading landscape. The decline in derivatives trading mirrors the overall sentiment of caution and reduced risk appetite among investors. Open Interest: A Significant Drop Perhaps even more telling than the trading volume itself is the significant decrease in open interest. Open interest across all trading pairs on CEXs plummeted by a staggering 30%, reaching $78.8 billion. This is the lowest level observed since November 2024, indicating a substantial reduction in the total number of outstanding derivative contracts. A sharp decline in open interest often signals a decrease in market participation and conviction, potentially foreshadowing further market corrections or consolidation. Here‚Äôs a quick comparison of key metrics: Metric January February Change CEX Trading Volume $9.1 Trillion $7.2 Trillion -21% CEX Open Interest $112.6 Billion $78.8 Billion -30% What Does This Mean for the Crypto Market? The February dip in crypto market activity raises important questions about the short-term trajectory of digital assets. While one month‚Äôs data doesn‚Äôt necessarily define a long-term trend, it‚Äôs crucial to analyze the potential implications: Reduced Liquidity: Lower trading volume can lead to reduced market liquidity, potentially making it harder to execute large trades without impacting prices. Increased Volatility: Paradoxically, lower liquidity can sometimes amplify volatility, as smaller trades can have a more significant price impact. Investor Caution: The decline reflects a degree of investor caution, possibly driven by macroeconomic uncertainties or a reassessment of risk appetite within the crypto space. Potential Buying Opportunity?: For some, periods of market pullback represent buying opportunities. However, thorough research and risk management are always paramount. Actionable Insights for Navigating CEX Trading in a Downturn So, what can crypto traders and investors do in light of these trends? Here are some actionable insights focused on navigating CEX platforms during periods of reduced trading volume: Exercise Caution: Be mindful of potentially increased volatility and reduced liquidity. Trade with smaller position sizes and use limit orders to manage risk. Diversify Strategies: Consider diversifying your trading strategies beyond simply buying and holding. Explore options like staking or yield farming to generate returns even in sideways markets. Stay Informed: Keep a close watch on market news and macroeconomic developments that could influence crypto prices and trading volume. Review Risk Management: Reassess your risk tolerance and adjust your portfolio allocation accordingly. Now might be a good time to tighten stop-loss orders and re-evaluate your overall investment strategy. Conclusion: Navigating the Ebb and Flow of Crypto Markets The 21% drop in CEX trading volume in February serves as a timely reminder of the cyclical nature of crypto markets. While the decline is noteworthy, it‚Äôs essential to maintain a balanced perspective. Market corrections and periods of reduced activity are natural parts of any investment cycle. By understanding the factors at play and adopting prudent trading strategies, investors can navigate these ebbs and flows and position themselves for future opportunities in the ever-evolving world of cryptocurrency.

It voted to push the bill to the full Senate while receiving support from even Democrats in the bloc. This marks a major step toward getting the legislation to President Donald Trump‚Äôs desk to be signed into law. Stablecoin Bill Receives Support From Democrats Senator Bill Hagerty, R-Tenn., introduced this bill in February to create a regulatory framework for stablecoins. The Guiding and Establishing National Innovation for US Stablecoins ‚ÄúGENIUS Act‚Äù defines the jurisdiction of the state and federal authorities over stablecoins. Senate Banking Committee Chair Tim Scott, R-S.C.,¬†described the bill as, ‚Äúa bipartisan step forward in ensuring stablecoins are safe and reliable tools in the financial system.‚Äù It has gained support from bipartisans like Democratic Sens. Angela Alsobrooks of Maryland and Kirsten Gillibrand of New York.¬†However, the supporting party grew when the Senate Banking Committee voted 18-6 to advance the bill. This is a significant milestone, considering several Washington lawmakers have failed to establish stablecoin regulatory frameworks. Congress Investigates Operation Chokepoint 2.0 Clearly, Trump‚Äôs administration is prioritizing cryptocurrencies, and Congress is getting more involved in the industry. Apart from supporting the implementation of stablecoin regulation, they have been more attentive to the talks about Operation Chokepoint 2.0. The US Congress has launched an investigation into crypto industry-wide debunking claims. Coinbase has been on the matter, criticizing the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) for its refusal to cooperate in the Operation Chokepoint 2.0 investigation. With Congress‚Äôs involvement, FDIC has been mandated to provide the requested information, including unredacted versions of pause letters. US Creates Strategic Bitcoin Reserve A week ago, President Trump signed an executive order establishing a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve and a U.S. Digital Asset Stockpile. According to White House AI and crypto czar David Sacks, this move is aimed at storing seized cryptocurrencies obtained through criminal¬†and civil cases. The US government will hold these Bitcoins from forfeiture of criminal activities for a long time instead of selling them. On the other hand, non-Bitcoin assets would be held separately in the Digital Asset Stockpile but will still be under the management of the Treasury Department.

The leading coin decoupled sharply from gold in the past few weeks, as the precious metal set new price records. Bitcoin decoupled sharply from gold, signaling its status as a store of value may be vulnerable to short-term fluctuations and aggressive trading. Gold set a series of new records, gaining attention from mainstream markets, while BTC continued its series of aggressive derivative trading with some spot selling pressure. The recent decoupling of BTC and gold made even maximalists question why the leading crypto coin was not seen as digital gold. The fact that gold is soaring and a superior form of gold, the digital gold Bitcoin is dumping is something I will never understand. I know Bitcoin trades like a tech stock, but I'll never be able to understand the reasoning for it. ‚Äî WhalePanda (@WhalePanda) March 13, 2025 The one advantage of BTC is that it is capable of rallying more sharply and delivering higher returns for early investors. However, gold also shows it is not forgotten during periods of uncertainty. Gold crossed $20 trillion in total market capitalization. At this valuation, BTC would have to command a price of $1M per coin, a valuation that seems unrealistic during the current market downturn. Despite the initially sluggish gold appreciation compared to BTC rallies, the metal has in fact outperformed BTC and given more short-term stability. Gold reaches new price records on demand for store of value Gold traded at $2,983.36 after the rapid expansion from March 10 onward. Geopolitical insecurity and rising demand extended gold‚Äôs gains to 34% for the past year, with even more accelerated gains in the past three months. Gold may also be vulnerable to selling and pressure from the holders of paper contracts, but for now, the market retains its momentum. XAUUSD one-hour price chart. Source/TradingView BTC is also capable of rapid rallies, but most of the bullish sentiment has dissipated. BTC is still widely held for the long term, but new buying does not reflect the demand for an asset to serve as a secure reserve. BTC faced downward pressure and dipped to $80,804.56 again, erasing the previous gains above $84,000. BTC remains pressured by panic sellers near the lows, as well as large daily long liquidations. BTCUSDT one-hour price chart. Source/TradingView Demand for gold has spilled over to silver, trading over $34 per ounce. Silver has not yet reached its previous all-time highs of over $46 per ounce, but this time around, the rally has more consistent trading volumes. BTC and gold lose correlation During previous local price peaks, BTC reached moments when one coin could buy over 1,000 grams of gold. The recent gold rally erased that correlation, and BTC can now buy a little lower than 1,000 grams. In the past month, BTC has been more closely correlated with S&P500 and NASDAQ than with gold. Historically, in some periods all assets move up or down together, but this time, gold stood out and once again approached the $3,000 level. BTC moved in unison with stock indexes, losing its correlation to gold. | Source: TheBlock Pearson Correlation Gold is also showing signs of physical demand through the Comex vault, and the current rally is not speculative trading for paper contracts. The Comex vaults have reached a peak at 1,250 tonnes of physical gold delivered. US-based demand is also bringing physical gold into the USA from European vaults, creating an additional sense of scarcity. At the same time, the talk of a crypto strategic reserve has slowed down, as BTC shows there are still enough sellers to depress the price. In theory, BTC is more scarce per person compared to gold, yet easily available physical gold remains limited, raising the spot price. The crypto space has attempted to offer tokenized gold. However, the available tokens are still a niche type of asset. Tokenized gold has a valuation of only $1.8B , with most of the value carried by Tether‚Äôs XAUT token.

In a new thread on the social media platform X, Santiment says that historically, when stablecoins activity rises when crypto prices are low, investors are ready to start accumulating assets. ‚ÄúTether‚Äôs on-chain activity has been rapidly rising, with over 143,000 wallets making transfers yesterday alone (a six-month high). When USDT (Tether) other stablecoin activity spikes during price drops, traders are preparing to buy.

Santiment says that once both trading volume and prices rise simultaneously, it will be a true sign the market is recovering ‚ÄúWhen trading volume for major cryptocurrencies consistently drops, even during slight price recoveries (like we have seen Wednesday), it typically points toward diminishing trader enthusiasm. In this scenario, traders are becoming cautious, suggesting they might not believe that the current upward price movements will last‚Ä¶ A weakening trading volume amid mild price bounces can serve as an early warning sign of weakening market momentum. Without robust buying participation, price gains can quickly lose steam, as there simply isn‚Äôt enough underlying support to sustain the upward trend‚Ä¶ To signal a healthier and more sustainable recovery, bulls generally will want to see both rising prices and rising volumes simultaneously.

This marks a significant move towards having the legislation reach President Trump‚Äôs desk for his signature. The bill cleared the committee with an 18-6 vote, benefitting from the support of five Senate Democrats who joined Republicans in advancing the proposal. Stablecoin Regulation Bill Heads Toward Trump The U.S. Senate Banking Committee has moved forward with the cryptocurrency industry‚Äôs stablecoin regulation bill, marking a critical move towards presidential approval. After obtaining its inaugural committee endorsement, the bill aimed at regulating U.S. stablecoin issuers federally is poised for a Senate vote, with a similar bill pending in the House of Representatives. Despite several obstacles ahead, such as reconciling differences between the Senate and House versions, the committee has successfully passed the bill with an 18-6 vote. Source Among the Democrats supporting the passage of the GENIUS Act were bill co-sponsor Angela Alsobrooks and Senate Banking Committee members Mark Warner, Andy Kim, Lisa Blunt Rochester, and Ruben Gallego. Bill Hagerty, the bill‚Äôs sponsor, expressed his aim to bring the bill to a full Senate vote by the end of April. Also read: Just In: Senator Hagerty Introduces GENIUS Act to Regulate Stablecoins At the Senate Banking Committee meeting on Thursday, Senator Elizabeth Warren, a known skeptic of cryptocurrency, proposed several amendments to the GENIUS Act. This legislation aims to establish a legal framework allowing nonbank stablecoin issuers to operate within the U.S. economy. Senator Elizabeth Warren suggested modifications to the GENIUS Act that would blacklist stablecoin issuers if their tokens were used for illegal activities, such as transactions with state enemies, drug trafficking, or purchasing child pornography. She also proposed extending the Act‚Äôs regulations to include crypto exchanges and other entities dealing with stablecoins. However, her proposed amendments were rejected along party lines. Republican Majority Prioritizes Stablecoin Legislation Near the end of the hearing, Elizabeth expressed strong reservations about advancing the bill, highlighting its numerous deficiencies and the timing of its progression amid reports that Donald Trump was attempting to launch his own stablecoin with a company known for legal violations. She referred to news that Trump-associated World Liberty Financial had been negotiating with the crypto exchange Binance. Warren criticized the decision to push the bill through while Trump was allegedly making deals with what she termed a criminal stablecoin platform, cautioning that it was a mistake likely to be regretted. Hagerty said, ‚ÄúIt presents common sense rules that protect consumers, promote competition, and foster innovation. It‚Äôs time we provide the clarity and stability that our country and its innovators so desperately need.‚Äù This year, the crypto industry is rallying bipartisan support in Congress for its policies.

Currently, SHIB is hovering near the $0.000011 support level, showing difficulty in recovering. Over the past week, the coin has dropped by 10%, following the general downturn in the broader crypto market. With this in mind, here are the top 5 risks that could further impact Shiba Inu‚Äôs price movement. Top 5 Factors That Could Affect Shiba Inu Price The Shiba Inu price continues to feel the impact of various market factors, with a direct correlation to the performance of its competitor, Dogecoin (DOGE). As DOGE struggles, losing 17% in value over the past week, Shiba Inu also experiences a downturn. This negative trend highlights the close relationship between these two meme coins in the broader crypto market. The meme coin sector, in general, is witnessing a decline. With a market capitalization of $2.63 trillion, the sector is down by 1.64%. As the second-largest meme-based coin after Dogecoin, Shiba Inu has not been immune to this dip. Furthermore, new meme coins like PENGU, TRUMP, FARTCOIN, and Ai16z are gaining attention, which threatens Shiba Inu‚Äôs position in the market. Another factor influencing Shiba Inu‚Äôs price is the price of BTC price , which is currently facing uncertainty. Analysts predict that BTC could fall to $70K or even $65K, causing a ripple effect across the cryptocurrency market. Shiba Inu, being linked to the performance of Bitcoin and other major altcoins, may see further declines if Bitcoin‚Äôs price continues to struggle. In addition, the broader macroeconomic outlook plays a crucial role in shaping market sentiment. Potential Federal Reserve interest rate hikes or delays in cuts could trigger broader market corrections , affecting cryptocurrencies like Shiba Inu. The ongoing trade tensions under Trump‚Äôs leadership also create uncertainty in the stock market, which could further pressure cryptocurrencies, including Shiba Inu. SHIB Price Shows Bearish Signals, Risks a 33% Decline The SHIB price hovered at $0.00001197 on March 13, 2025, experiencing a slight dip of 9%. In the past 24-hours, the meme coins showed some volatility, with support levels at $0.00001150 and resistance near $0.000013. This suggests a potential risk of further decline if the downward pressure persists. The Moving Average Convergence Divergence indicator shows a bearish crossover, with the MACD line (blue) moving below the signal line (orange). The histogram also reflects negative momentum, which further supports the possibility of continued bearish movement. If this trend continues, the Shiba Inu price prediction could see a drop toward the $0.000008 mark, representing a potential 33% decline from its current price. Additionally, the Chaikin Money Flow (CMF) indicator remains positive at 0.03, indicating that there is still some buying pressure in the market. Source: TradingView To sum up, the Shiba Inu price faces significant risks, including its relationship with Dogecoin, competition from new meme coins, Bitcoin‚Äôs uncertainty, and macroeconomic challenges. If these risks persist, SHIB‚Äôs price could see further declines.

In a March 12 trial in the US District Court for the Northern District of California, a jury found AML Bitcoin creator Rowland Marcus Andrade guilty of two felony counts as part of a scheme to defraud investors. Authorities initially filed criminal charges against Andrade in June 2020 in parallel to a civil case filed by the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) against the AML Bitcoin creator and the NAC Foundation, for which he was the founder and CEO. ‚ÄúMr. Andrade‚Äôs outrageous lies lured and scammed individuals into investing their hard-earned money into a new cryptocurrency with fabricated features,‚Äù said Linda Nguyen, the IRS Criminal Investigation Oakland Field Office Special Agent in Charge. ‚ÄúBut there is nothing advanced about this scheme. Rowland Marcus Andrade stole money from innocent people and used it to further his personal wealth.‚Äù Rowland Marcus Andrade jury verdict on March 12. Source: PACER The SEC‚Äôs civil case against Andrade was notable for the involvement of political lobbyist Jack Abramoff, who served four years in prison between 2006 and 2010 following his conviction on mail fraud, conspiracy to bribe public officials and tax evasion. A judge agreed to stay the SEC lawsuit in January 2021 until the conclusion of Andrade‚Äôs criminal case, suggesting that it may once again proceed soon. The June 2020 indictment alleged the NAC Foundation claimed a cryptocurrency that AML Bitcoin would launch ‚Äî it never did ‚Äî would comply with money laundering and Know Your Customer (KYC) regulations. Andrade used those claims for an initial coin offering between 2017 and 2018. According to the information presented at his trial, the AML Bitcoin creator diverted more than $2 million in proceeds from the sale of the platform, spending it on real estate and luxury automobiles.

The AML Bitcoin creator is scheduled to return to court for a sentencing hearing on July 22, having remained free on a $75,000 bond since 2020 with some travel restrictions.

To read full editions, subscribe . Senator Bill Hagerty‚Äôs GENIUS Act ‚Äî aiming to establish regulatory guidelines for stablecoin issuers ‚Äî advanced to the Senate floor today after a Banking Committee markup. If there‚Äôs bipartisan support for the legislation, it was not apparent during today‚Äôs debate. Democrats put forth a number of amendments to the bill, urging lawmakers to adopt further protections against money laundering and consider more strict guidelines for issuers to receive licenses. Republican Committee members voted against all of Sen. Elizabeth Warren‚Äôs proposed amendments, often with little debate. Hagerty and Sen. Cynthia Lummis, the Act‚Äôs main champions, argued the current bill includes AML provisions, robust reserve guidelines, and a strict registration process for issuers. Democrat proposals would only increase regulatory oversight without increasing consumer protection, Lummis added. At one point Sen. Warren criticized her Republican colleagues and accused them of ‚Äústeamrolling‚Äù Democrats to advance the bill. In the end, four Democrats (Sens. Warner, Kim, Blunt-Rochester and Gellego) voted to move the bill out of committee and to the floor. The GENIUS Act now moves to the full Senate, which will debate the legislation, potentially add amendments, and eventually vote. Should it pass, the legislation will move to the House. Representatives on the House Financial Services Committee are currently considering a similar bill, the STABLE Act, which they discussed earlier this week in a hearing. The legislation is still in the discussion draft phase and has not formally been introduced. Get the news in your inbox.

Presale investors have purchased Mutuum Finance (MUTM) tokens through 5,300 transactions totaling $3.1 million before reaching the planned price rise from $0.02 to $0.025. Phase 4 introduces a 25% rise in Mutuum Finance prices which produces immediate profit opportunities showing that MUTM tokens will eventually rise to $0.06 for a total profit increase of 200%. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) experts tracking operational features of the protocol forecast that its price will surpass $2.20 following the launch while early token buyers will experience an 11 thousand percent profit. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Presale Momentum Builds Rapid Demand The presale process for Mutuum Finance (MUTM) continues to intensify since Phase 3 approaches its capacity limit due to its defined tokenomics structure with yield-enhancing features. The Mutuum Finance (MUTM) project implements a lending model that permits borrowing assets through deposits with excess collateral similar to Aave but offers a unique variation. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) sets itself apart from speculative DeFi tokens because it operates a buy-and-distribute model to obtain platform fees that the system uses to purchase more tokens which flow back to providers. The mechanism produces continuous demand for the assets although Solana-based margin protocols lack this characteristic. The scheduled Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Phase 4 price increase to 25% has reduced the opportunity to buy tokens at their current value of $0.02 to a short timespan. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Lending Mechanics Drive Sustainable Growth Mutuum Finance introduces mtTokens as dynamic financial assets which represent mutual funds from deposits including ETH and USDT. These token-based assets increase their value with time while generating passive returns to holders while other peer coins such as Dogecoin do not offer this utility benefit. A Mutuum Finance (MUTM) system stability protocol requires borrowers to provide assets which have higher value than their loan amount. The process to obtain a $5,000 USDT loan requires depositing $7,000 in ETH thus reducing the odds of defaulting. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Users can use the peer-to-peer lending feature of this platform to make direct deals about terms which enables unique support for assets such as Shiba Inu although top competitors cannot match this capability. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Exchange Listings and Long-Term Forecasts The upcoming exchange listing of Mutuum Finance at $0.06 price provides presale participants with an initial exit point yet its long-run forecast points to substantially more promising value. The buy-pressure mechanism alongside the $100,000 early purchase incentivization creates continuous support for investors. The market analyst community indicates that Mutuum Finance (MUTM) tokens maintain limited availability after the launch because public sales only receive 20% of the available supply. Real-world lending features backed by DeFi adoption during 2025 may drive Mutuum Finance (MUTM) towards surpassing its current value to reach $2.20 which represents an 11,000% rise. Mutuum Finance gained the attention of the Solana whale because its project demonstrates how utility-focused initiatives merge with strong token economic strategies. The upcoming evolution of Mutuum Finance (MUTM) along with its swiftly moving exchange listings creates a special moment for investors to benefit from pre-launch Mutuum Finance (MUTM) token prices that will probably start to rise.

In a new post, pseudonymous crypto trader Altcoin Sherpa tells his 244,000 followers on the social media platform X that Bitcoin may revisit the $60,000 range if BTC loses $78,000 as support. However, he says if Bitcoin can reclaim the $90,000 range, the flagship crypto asset may reach its all-time high of about $109,000. ‚ÄúBTC basically just two paths. This low established at $78,000 feels really vital and if we lose that, you just see mid-$60,000s. If we can somehow get back within the range at $90,000, you probably see a retest of ATH (all-time highs). But that‚Äôs a while away. Until then, it‚Äôs mostly a waiting game. Expect a lot more volatility for a bit until we actually see where this bottoms and then probably some calm after.

Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Litecoin (LTC) recently faced major setbacks. Meanwhile, BlockDAG (BDAG) is growing steadily due to its powerful technology and promising partnerships. SHIB and LTC are currently facing significant price drops and selling pressure. In contrast, BlockDAG stands apart due to its hybrid Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) and Proof of Work (PoW) blockchain technology. Its recent partnership with SpaceDev further strengthens this position, attracting developers and increasing market confidence. Shiba Inu: Holders Worried as Prices Drop, Whales Active Shiba Inu (SHIB) faces tough market conditions, causing holders to worry. Recently, SHIB‚Äôs price dropped to $0.000013, down 22% in just one month. This decrease happened despite a sharp 300% rise in whale transactions, suggesting big holders are buying more at lower prices. Although technical charts indicate a possible upward turn, SHIB‚Äôs trading shows a descending triangle pattern. This typically suggests ongoing selling pressure. The Relative Strength Index points to possible positive movement, but the market‚Äôs overall sentiment remains cautious. The ongoing selling pressure makes the future uncertain for Shiba Inu. Litecoin: Heavy Selling Pressure with Over 10% Loss Litecoin (LTC) recently faced significant selling pressure, losing 10.01% of its value quickly. Its price dropped sharply to about $77.63, reflecting the heavy market selloff. This latest drop continues Litecoin‚Äôs negative trend, resulting in an 11.69% total decrease recently. Currently, LTC trades around $77.63, and its market activity remains under pressure. Although technical indicators show Litecoin has strong resistance at around $90.92, the selling pressure might continue in the short term. If the market remains weak, Litecoin‚Äôs price might fall further, highlighting its current struggles compared to other cryptos. BlockDAG: Hybrid DAG and PoW Tech for Superior Blockchain BlockDAG stands apart from others by combining Proof of Work (PoW) and Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) technology. Unlike regular blockchains, BlockDAG eliminates slow transaction processes by validating multiple transactions simultaneously. This unique method allows BlockDAG to process transactions instantly, making it highly scalable and efficient. Recently, BlockDAG partnered with SpaceDev, a respected company known for blockchain and software expertise. This partnership boosts BlockDAG‚Äôs technological strengths. SpaceDev will manage technical growth, organize global hackathons, run an Ambassador Program, and provide developer grants. These activities will attract more developers, ensuring BlockDAG grows even stronger. The market response to BlockDAG‚Äôs presale has been impressive. The project raised more than $202 million, now reaching batch 27. Its price surged dramatically, up 2380% to $0.0248. Over 18.7 billion coins have already been sold, showing strong market demand. Miner sales reached over $6.5 million, with 16,000 miners sold. These achievements prove the project‚Äôs significant momentum and market trust. Analysts expect BlockDAG‚Äôs price to rise further as it approaches listings on major exchanges. Given its powerful technology, rising developer activity, and successful fundraising, BlockDAG has emerged as a leading cryptocurrency. As it moves toward global use, this hybrid blockchain offers users a stable and promising option, unlike struggling cryptos. BlockDAG Shines with 2380% Surge and Stability Amid Crypto Market Slump BlockDAG Offers Stability Amid Market Declines While Shiba Inu and Litecoin face declining prices and uncertainty, BlockDAG‚Äôs progress shines clearly. SHIB struggles despite whales buying heavily at lower prices, and Litecoin remains under strong selling pressure. BlockDAG, however, stands apart due to its strong fundamentals and rising demand. Raising over $202 million with a huge 2380% increase since the first batch shows BDAG‚Äôs strength. Its SpaceDev partnership further enhances its potential for steady growth. With strong technical foundations, significant developer support, and upcoming exchange listings, BlockDAG provides stability and huge potential. This makes BlockDAG the most promising crypto in the current market environment.

The latest LTC price analysis reveals continued strength, with Litecoin showing resilience amid market volatility and targeting a potential surge to $370. Meanwhile, the Hyperliquid price dip of 15% has triggered interest from whales, with millions of dollars flowing into HYPE, signaling a possible sharp recovery. Amid these market moves, Web3Bay is taking a different path, focusing on transforming e-commerce through decentralization. By eliminating middlemen and enabling direct peer-to-peer transactions, Web3Bay offers lower fees, greater transparency, and full control over user data‚Äîsomething traditional e-commerce giants simply can‚Äôt provide. For those looking for the best long term crypto, Web3Bay‚Äôs innovative approach could make it a top contender.

Currently, in its 5th stage, the presale offers 3BAY tokens at a price of $0.00524. Early supporters are seeing real potential here, as the projected launch price of $0.1959 per token suggests a substantial opportunity for growth. The presale‚Äôs structured stages, with increasing token prices, also provide clear incentives for early participation.

With its focus on rewarding users and ensuring transparency, Web3Bay is shaping up to be more than just another crypto project‚Äîit‚Äôs building a marketplace that could well be among the best long term crypto choices for those looking to benefit from a decentralized e-commerce revolution. LTC Price Analysis: Is Litecoin Set for a Breakout? The latest LTC price analysis suggests that Litecoin could be gearing up for a significant move. After showing strength with a 10% increase amid broader market uncertainty, Litecoin is targeting a breakout towards the $370 range high. Analysts are watching closely as the LTC price analysis indicates that the coin‚Äôs strong performance against Bitcoin and its resilience during market dips could signal a bullish trend. On the technical front, Litecoin has formed a 5-year-long uptrend, with the weekly chart showing multiple resistance breakouts. The recent absorption of a major sell-off and the sustained interest in LTC add to the positive outlook. If Litecoin manages to break the critical $140 resistance level, the next target could be $370, making it a coin to watch for those looking for robust opportunities in the market. Hyperliquid Price Dip: Are Whales Betting on a Rebound? The recent Hyperliquid price dip of 15% has caught the market‚Äôs attention, but the smart money seems to see an opportunity. With whales accumulating millions of dollars in HYPE tokens, including a $1.5 million purchase and a $3.5 million limit order, the Hyperliquid price dip might be setting the stage for a significant rebound. The platform‚Äôs strong fundamentals, including its $624 million total value locked, add weight to the bullish outlook. Technical indicators also suggest potential for a recovery. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) has bounced back to 50, and the 30-period moving average is showing signs of life. Market analysts predict that if buying pressure continues, HYPE could hit $25 in the coming weeks and possibly reach $30 by the end of Q2 2025. The ongoing whale activity reinforces the possibility of a strong turnaround. The Final Take The latest LTC price analysis points to a potential breakout for Litecoin, with the coin holding strong and targeting $370 if it breaks the critical $140 resistance. Meanwhile, the Hyperliquid price dip has led to significant whale accumulation, suggesting a possible rebound to $25 and even $30 by the end of Q2 2025. Amid these trends, Web3Bay is making its mark by transforming e-commerce with its decentralized model. By removing middlemen and enabling peer-to-peer transactions, Web3Bay offers lower fees, greater transparency, and complete control over user data. This innovative approach positions Web3Bay as the best long term crypto, offering real utility and a clear path to growth.

Data Shows 87.5% Chance The Worst Is Over,https://www.newsbtc.com/news/bitcoin/bitcoin-bottom-confirmed-data-87-5-chance/,"In the ongoing debate over Bitcoin‚Äôs market trajectory, two prominent crypto analysts have shared contrasting viewpoints on X, underscoring the community‚Äôs divided sentiment. While one maintains that a drastic downturn remains possible, the other posits that the worst of the market downturn has already passed‚Äîciting a notable 87.5% probability. Bitcoin Bears In Trouble? Crypto analyst Doctor Profit (@DrProfitCrypto) posted on X and laid out two potential paths for Bitcoin: ‚ÄúThere are two scenarios: A) Bottom to be 68-74k region in normal market, B) Full crash towards 50k in Black Swan event.‚Äù He did not provide a specific probability for either outcome but emphasized that a Black Swan event‚Äîa term used to describe a rare, unexpected event that can drastically impact markets‚Äîcannot be ruled out. While noting that such an extraordinary downturn was previously unlikely, he now concedes that recent shifts in the macro landscape may leave room for it:‚ÄúTake your bets, I would say that a Black Swan event was very unlikely in the last few months, but ask me now, I would not rule it out, rather welcome it.‚Äù Related Reading: Bitcoin Teeters On The Edge: Will This Pivot Hold Or Collapse? In direct contrast, crypto analyst Astronomer (@astronomer_zero) responded with a more bullish outlook, asserting that the bottom is already behind us. He referenced a track record of Bitcoin price reversals around Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meetings, claiming it works ‚Äú14 out of 16 times,‚Äù or roughly 87.5% of the time. ‚ÄúNot guarantees, but an 87.5% chance, granted the chart below and all the confluences I already presented. So far so good.‚Äù His approach relies on mapping out price movements in proximity to FOMC dates, noting that markets often price in interest rate decisions (and related news) before official announcements. Astronomer‚Äôs method contends that Bitcoin typically finds local bottoms in a window spanning from up to five ‚Äú2D bars‚Äù before an FOMC date to the day of the meeting itself. ‚ÄúAll it requires is flip on a daily (or 2 daily in my case to keep the chart clean) timeframe, plot out all the dates FOMC meeting appeared, and see what price did. This shows that indeed price tends to reverse when time is nearing into FOMC. The caveat is that the price reverses before or at the very latest, right at the FOMC day,‚Äù the analyst writes. Related Reading: Bitcoin Shows Signs of Recovery‚ÄîIs the Whale Sell-Off Finally Over? He points out that the next FOMC meeting is scheduled for March 19, meaning the bottom‚Äîif the historical pattern holds‚Äîshould appear no later than that date: ‚ÄúWorks almost every time, 14 out of 16 times in fact (or 87.5% of the time)‚Ä¶ The time difference the bottom happens versus the FOMC day is usually 0 to 5 2D bars before the exact date. Given the next FOMC is the 19th of March, that means the low is in the latest that day and the earliest the 5th of March.‚Äù To bolster his argument, Astronomer points to what he perceives as ‚Äúpeaking fear‚Äù in the market. He views heightened pessimism and ‚Äúcautionary posts out of nowhere‚Äù from established traders as typical signals that a rebound could be imminent: ‚ÄúSentiment wise, fear is peaking to hilarious levels. Even ‚ÄòReputable‚Äô traders are protecting their reputation I don‚Äôt blame anyone‚Äôs methods, but I take it as a great sign of a bottom.‚Äù At press time, BTC traded at $83,277.

Recent shifts in currency valuations can ripple through the crypto sphere, impacting trading strategies and investment decisions. Today, we delve into a significant development in the Forex arena: HSBC‚Äôs updated GBP/USD forecast . While the financial giant has raised its projections for the pair, a shadow of potential weakness looms on the horizon. Let‚Äôs unpack what this means for traders and investors alike, exploring the factors driving this revised outlook and what cautionary signals to watch out for. Decoding the Latest GBP/USD Forecast from HSBC HSBC, a global financial institution, has recently adjusted its GBP/USD forecast , offering a revised perspective on the future trajectory of this major currency pair. This update is noteworthy because HSBC‚Äôs analyses are closely watched by market participants worldwide, often influencing trading strategies and investment decisions. But what exactly does this new forecast entail, and why should you pay attention, even if you‚Äôre primarily focused on crypto markets? The core of the update lies in an increased near-term optimism for the Pound against the US Dollar. This upward revision suggests that HSBC analysts believe the GBP/USD pair is likely to appreciate in the immediate future. This positive adjustment could stem from a variety of factors, including: Positive Economic Indicators in the UK: Stronger-than-expected economic data from the United Kingdom, such as improved GDP figures, declining unemployment rates, or robust retail sales, can bolster the Pound‚Äôs value. Shifting Monetary Policy Expectations: Anticipation of more hawkish monetary policy from the Bank of England (BoE) compared to the Federal Reserve (Fed) in the US can make the Pound more attractive to investors seeking higher yields. For instance, if markets expect the BoE to raise interest rates more aggressively than the Fed, demand for GBP could increase, pushing the GBP/USD rate higher. Weakening US Dollar Sentiment: Conversely, factors that weaken the US Dollar, such as concerns about the US economic outlook, rising inflation without corresponding interest rate hikes, or geopolitical uncertainties, can indirectly strengthen the GBP/USD pair. Technical Factors and Market Positioning: Sometimes, purely technical factors, like trend reversals on charts or shifts in market positioning (e.g., speculators reducing their short positions on the Pound), can contribute to a revised GBP/USD forecast . It‚Äôs important to remember that these forecasts are not guarantees, but rather informed opinions based on current data and analysis. However, understanding the reasoning behind these revisions can provide valuable context for your own market assessments. Why is the Forex Forecast Relevant to the Crypto Market? You might be wondering, ‚ÄúWhy should I, as a crypto enthusiast, care about a Forex forecast ?‚Äù The answer is multifaceted, highlighting the interconnectedness of global financial markets: Risk Sentiment Correlation: Forex markets, particularly major pairs like GBP/USD, often reflect broader risk sentiment in global markets. When risk appetite is high, currencies like the Pound (considered risk-on) can strengthen against safe-haven currencies like the US Dollar. This risk-on sentiment frequently spills over into the cryptocurrency market, leading to increased demand and potentially higher prices for digital assets. Dollar‚Äôs Dominance: The US Dollar remains the world‚Äôs reserve currency and the primary pricing currency for many commodities and assets, including cryptocurrencies. Fluctuations in the Dollar‚Äôs value directly impact the price of Bitcoin and other cryptos when priced against USD. A weaker Dollar, as potentially implied by parts of HSBC‚Äôs analysis, can make assets priced in USD, including crypto, appear relatively cheaper and more attractive. Macroeconomic Insights: Forex forecasts are built upon macroeconomic analysis, considering factors like inflation, interest rates, economic growth, and geopolitical events. These same macroeconomic forces influence the cryptocurrency market. Understanding the Forex outlook provides a valuable lens through which to view the broader economic landscape affecting all asset classes, including crypto. Trading Strategy Diversification: For traders looking to diversify their strategies, insights from Forex forecasts can inform cross-market trading approaches. For example, if a weakening Dollar is anticipated, traders might consider strategies that benefit from a weaker USD, both in Forex and crypto markets. In essence, staying informed about Forex developments, such as HSBC‚Äôs Forex forecast revisions, equips you with a more holistic understanding of the financial environment that shapes the crypto market. The Looming Weakness: What Cautions Does HSBC Highlight? While HSBC‚Äôs revised Currency Market outlook includes a near-term upgrade for GBP/USD, it‚Äôs crucial to acknowledge the caveat ‚Äì the anticipation of weakness ahead. This isn‚Äôt a purely bullish signal; instead, it‚Äôs a nuanced perspective that suggests a potential temporary upswing followed by a downturn. What are the potential sources of this looming weakness? Persistent Inflationary Pressures: While some inflation indicators might be showing signs of easing, persistent inflationary pressures in the UK and globally could still weigh on economic growth. If inflation remains stubbornly high, it could necessitate more aggressive interest rate hikes, potentially slowing down economic activity and impacting the Pound negatively in the medium to long term. Economic Slowdown Risks: The global economy faces headwinds from various sources, including geopolitical instability, supply chain disruptions, and the lagged effects of previous interest rate increases. A significant economic slowdown, particularly in the UK or globally, could diminish demand for the Pound. Divergence in Central Bank Policies: While HSBC might anticipate near-term hawkishness from the BoE, future policy decisions are uncertain. If the Fed becomes more aggressive in its monetary policy tightening than currently anticipated, or if the BoE becomes less hawkish due to economic concerns, this could shift the dynamics and favor the US Dollar, weakening the Pound US Dollar pair. Geopolitical Risks: Unforeseen geopolitical events can trigger significant market volatility and currency fluctuations. Escalations in existing conflicts or new geopolitical tensions could impact investor sentiment and lead to shifts in currency valuations, potentially weakening the Pound. This element of caution in HSBC‚Äôs analysis is vital. It suggests that while there might be short-term opportunities for GBP appreciation, the longer-term outlook remains uncertain and potentially tilted towards weakness. Traders and investors should be prepared for potential volatility and downside risks. Actionable Insights: Navigating the GBP/USD Landscape So, how can you translate this Currency Market analysis into actionable insights, particularly if you are involved in crypto trading or investment? Short-Term Trading Opportunities: The revised positive near-term GBP/USD forecast might present short-term trading opportunities in the Forex market. Traders could consider strategies that capitalize on potential GBP strength against the USD in the immediate future. However, this should be approached with caution and robust risk management, given the anticipated weakness ahead. Crypto Market Correlation Awareness: Be mindful of the potential correlation between GBP/USD movements and the cryptocurrency market. A strengthening Pound, particularly if driven by positive risk sentiment, could coincide with positive movements in crypto prices. Conversely, a weakening Pound, especially if linked to risk aversion, might signal caution for crypto markets as well. Dollar-Cost Averaging Considerations: For long-term crypto investors, understanding the Pound US Dollar outlook can inform dollar-cost averaging strategies. If a weaker Dollar is anticipated in the medium term (despite potential short-term GBP strength), it might be strategically advantageous to accumulate crypto assets when the Dollar is relatively stronger. Diversification and Hedging: The uncertainty highlighted in HSBC‚Äôs analysis underscores the importance of diversification. Holding a diversified portfolio across different asset classes, including Forex, crypto, and traditional assets, can help mitigate risks associated with volatility in any single market. Forex instruments can also be used to hedge against currency risk in crypto portfolios, although this requires careful consideration and understanding of hedging strategies. Continuous Monitoring: Financial markets are dynamic. Relying solely on a single forecast is insufficient. Continuously monitor economic data releases, central bank announcements, geopolitical developments, and market sentiment to stay ahead of potential shifts in the Forex Forecast and the broader market landscape. By integrating insights from Forex analysis into your broader market understanding, you can make more informed decisions in the crypto space and navigate market fluctuations with greater confidence. Conclusion: A Cautiously Optimistic Glimpse with a Reality Check HSBC‚Äôs updated GBP/USD forecast offers a fascinating glimpse into the complexities of the Currency Market . The raised near-term outlook provides a dose of optimism, suggesting potential opportunities for GBP strength. However, the crucial caveat of looming weakness serves as a vital reality check. This forecast is not a straightforward bullish signal but rather a nuanced perspective that demands careful consideration. For crypto market participants, understanding these Forex dynamics is increasingly important. The interconnectedness of global finance means that shifts in major currency pairs like GBP/USD can have ripple effects across all asset classes, including digital currencies. By staying informed, adapting strategies, and exercising caution, you can navigate the ever-evolving financial landscape with greater resilience and insight.

The price battle comes amid the U.S. SEC delaying its decision on the Canary Capital ADA exchange-traded fund (ETF) application until May 29, prolonging uncertainty in the market. While whale accumulation suggests confidence among investors, ADA price action remains constrained within key technical levels, raising concerns about a decline to $0.30. Cardano Price: Analysts Warn of a Drop To $0.30 According to recent Cardano price trends, the top altcoin remains in a critical position as it hovers around the $0.70 mark. Analysts warn that if ADA fails to hold above this level, the price could drop to $0.50 and potentially extend losses toward $0.30. Crypto analyst Dan Gambardello noted that ADA is struggling to hold its 200-week moving average, a crucial technical indicator. If the altcoin loses support in this range, selling pressure may increase, pushing the price lower. This scenario aligns with past market trends, where similar breakdowns resulted in sharp declines. Moreover, Gambardello described the top altcoin as being ‚Äúat war,‚Äù highlighting the uncertainty caused by the SEC‚Äôs decision to delay ETF ruling. This delay has left investors hesitant, with many awaiting regulatory clarity before making moves. Additionally, Gambardello warned that external economic factors, such as the Federal Reserve‚Äôs policy decisions, could further impact ADA price. If the Fed‚Äôs actions disappoint the market, volatility could drive crypto prices lower, with ADA potentially dropping to $0.50. However, a sustained hold above the 200-week MA and a break past $0.78-$0.80 could trigger bullish momentum, possibly pushing ADA toward $1.25. This level, Gambardello suggests, represents the ‚Äúupper end of the bull market doors,‚Äù a critical threshold Cardano price. Source: X Technical Pattern Suggest Breakout Additionally, Ali Martinez identified a right-angle descending wedge pattern in Cardano price movements, signaling a potential breakout. The altcoin price is currently squeezed between a downward-sloping trendline and horizontal resistance, a setup that often precedes a significant price shift. For a bullish breakout, ADA must break above the $1.20 resistance level. If this occurs with strong momentum, it could trigger further upside movement. However, failure to surpass resistance may result in extended consolidation or a downward move to the $0.30 mark. Source: X Whale Investors Accumulate 180M ADA Despite recent volatility, large investors have increased their holdings in Cardano . On-chain data shows that wallets holding between 1 million and 10 million ADA have accumulated 180 million tokens in the past week. This trend suggests strong confidence among major investors. Whale accumulation often reduces the circulating supply, potentially leading to price stabilization or upward movement. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has postponed its decision on the Grayscale Cardano ETF. This delay adds to market uncertainty, as ETF approvals often influence investor sentiment. The SEC has also delayed other crypto ETF applications, including those for Solana, XRP, Dogecoin, and Litecoin. Additionally, The Simpsons shared a more intriguing prediction by suggesting the top altcoin could reach $36, sparking debate among investors.

This comes despite the latest US Producer Price Index (PPI) data confirming a continued slowdown in industrial inflation. With technical indicators flashing bearish signals and macroeconomic headwinds building, Ethereum now faces a critical test of investor confidence. Why Is Ethereum Price Falling Despite Easing US Inflation? Ethereum‚Äôs price action has remained fragile in recent months, with upward momentum struggling to gain traction. While the latest inflation reports fueled a broader market recovery, Ethereum has decoupled from the broader market recovery phase, pinned down by internal bearish catalysts. On Wednesday, the US Consumer Price Index (CPI) data sparked optimism across risk assets, helping major cryptocurrencies like XRP, BNB, and PEPE break key resistance levels. The bullish sentiment extended into Thursday when the US Bureau of Labor Statistics confirmed that Producer Prices in the United States declined to 147.95 points in February from 147.98 points in January 2025. US PPI data, March 2025 Historically, a declining PPI suggests lower input costs for businesses, easing inflationary pressures and reinforcing expectations of a dovish pivot from the Federal Reserve. This typically encourages risk-on sentiment, boosting assets like Ethereum. However, ETH price has failed to capitalize on the broader market optimism. Ethereum Plunges 35% in 3 weeks Losing Key Support Despite easing inflation signals, Ethereum recorded its third consecutive daily decline this week. At press time, ETH had fallen to $1,850, marking a 3% drop on Thursday alone. The downward trend accelerated after ETH plunged from $2,819 on Tuesday to a low of $1,759 on Thursday, a staggering 35% decline in 48 hours. ETH Price Action, March 2025 | Source: TradigView Zooming out, historical data shows that ETH price has not registered three consecutive weeks of gains since early December 2024. This prolonged weakness suggests an underlying shift in market sentiment, independent of macroeconomic data. 2. Ethereum Foundation Leadership Shuffle and Network Updates Weigh on Sentiment Ethereum‚Äôs recent losses align with internal structural shifts that have unsettled investors. A leadership shake-up at the Ethereum Foundation , coupled with network upgrade uncertainties, has added to bearish sentiment. These developments suggest ETH has decoupled from broader market trends, charting an independent downward trajectory. At the same time, growing competition in the altcoin market has further eroded Ethereum‚Äôs dominance. Emerging layer-1 blockchains and increasing capital inflows into Solana, Avalanche, and alternative DeFi ecosystems have siphoned liquidity away from Ethereum-based DeFi applications. 2. Hawkish Fed Outlook and Rising ETH Market Supply Weigh on Staking Demand Before this week‚Äôs CPI and PPI reports hinted at easing inflation, Ethereum‚Äôs price action had already been under pressure from rising Treasury yields and a hawkish Federal Reserve outlook. Friday‚Äôs upcoming Non-Farm Payrolls (NFP) report has fueled additional concerns, as stronger-than-expected labor market data could reinforce the case for prolonged high interest rates. Higher interest rates have direct implications for Ethereum‚Äôs DeFi sector. With risk-free yields on US Treasuries remaining attractive, investors are reallocating capital away from Ethereum-based staking and yield-bearing protocols. This shift has lowered demand for ETH staking, further pressuring price action. As more investors lean toward external yield markets, Ethereum price could remain vulnerable in the near term, with the next key support level sitting near $1,500. If bulls fail to defend this zone, ETH could face further declines, prolonging its underperformance relative to the broader crypto market. 3. Ethereum Price Forecast: Fresh Death Cross signal hints at Reversal to $1,500 Ethereum price forecast indicators remains decisively bearish, with the weekly chart signalling a continuation of the ongoing downtrend. ETH has plunged 35% in just two weeks, breaking below key moving averages and testing multi-month lows. With downside momentum accelerating, Ethereum now risks further declines toward the $1,500 mark. The weekly candlestick structure confirms sustained selling pressure, with consecutive large-bodied red candles suggesting a lack of meaningful dip-buying interest. Ethereum has lost the 200-day EMA at $2,066, an essential long-term support level. Ethereum Price Forecast The MACD histogram extends deeper into negative territory, reinforcing bearish momentum as its signal line diverges downward. If ETH fails to reclaim the $2,272 resistance, sellers could push prices lower. Despite the bearish setup, bulls may attempt to defend the $1,844 level, where demand previously emerged. A relief rally above this zone could target the $2,662 resistance, aligning with the 50-day EMA. However, the downward trajectory of the moving averages suggests that any short-term rebound may face rejection. Failure to establish a base above $1,844 would validate the bearish breakdown, opening the door to $1,500 as the next major support. With momentum indicators pointing to continued weakness, Ethereum remains vulnerable to further downside.

The U.S.-based firm will now be able to offer fully regulated cross-border crypto payments in the United Arab Emirates (UAE), which boasts a $40 billion remittance market. Ripple‚Äôs Growing Presence in the Middle East The DFSA license marks Ripple‚Äôs first regulatory approval in the Middle East. The company has been steadily increasing its footprint in the region since setting up an office in Dubai‚Äôs special economic zone in 2020. Currently, nearly 20% of its global customers are based in the Middle East, and its entry into this market is meant to address long-standing inefficiencies such as high fees, slow settlement times, and lack of transparency. According to a 2024 Ripple survey, 64% of players in the financial industry in Africa and the Middle East see blockchain-based currencies as key to improving payment speeds. Reacting to the approval, Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse stressed the importance of regulatory transparency in driving growth in the digital asset space. ‚ÄúWe are entering an unprecedented period of growth for the crypto industry, driven by greater regulatory clarity around the world and increasing institutional adoption,‚Äù he said. The company now has a portfolio of over 60 approvals across the globe. These include licenses from the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS), New York‚Äôs Department of Financial Services (NYDFS), as well as Ireland‚Äôs Central Bank . XRP Price Reaction Meanwhile, XRP, Ripple‚Äôs native cryptocurrency, is experiencing notable market fluctuations. Off the back of the UAE announcement, its price went up 3% to $2.23, having oscillated between $2.14 and $2.26 in the last 24 hours. Despite the short-term gains, the token has recorded an 11.8% decline over the past week, underperforming the broader crypto market, which is down 8.9%. However, it remains up nearly 219% year-over-year at a time when other major cryptocurrencies like Ethereum (ETH), Solana (SOL), and Cardano (ADA) are in the red in that period. Elsewhere, it could be more good news for the crypto company regarding its prolonged lawsuit with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Some legal experts have suggested the case could soon come to an end , with Fred Rispoli hinting at a settlement between Ripple and the regulator before the former‚Äôs appellate brief filing deadline in April.

To read full editions, subscribe . The DeFi trading experience is a balancing act. Market makers juggle cost and efficiency, while traders deal with delays, slippage, and the ever-present reality of MEV extraction. Onchain execution can be slow, liquidity is often scattered across different venues, and gas fees ‚Äî even on Solana ‚Äî still exist. These are just a few of the problems that Drift ‚Äî the largest derivatives platform on Solana ‚Äî set out to solve with Swift Protocol. Its new trading standard is designed to maximize execution speed, minimize slippage, and make trading truly gasless across perpetuals and spot markets. Most onchain trades today are scattered across AMMs, order books, and private market makers, leading to suboptimal execution. Swift Protocol consolidates these sources into a single execution layer. Instead of waiting for confirmations, Swift broadcasts orders to market makers, who compete to fill them in milliseconds, ensuring better prices and deeper liquidity. Not too shabby. For Swift Protocol to work, it needs liquidity providers to be active participants. Traditionally, market makers on Solana manage order book quotes, a process that can be inefficient. JIT market making improves this by only submitting fills when needed, reducing unnecessary gas costs. Swift further enhances this by introducing a WebSocket-based system that simplifies market maker integration, allowing them to react to orders instantly and efficiently. Swift also removes gas fees for traders, and does not impose additional costs on market makers, according to Chris Heaney, co-founder of Drift and lead on Swift Protocol. ‚ÄúJIT makers already pay gas to submit their fills. They don‚Äôt have to pay any additional gas fees vis-a-vis what they‚Äôre currently paying,‚Äù he told Lightspeed. This minimizes unnecessary gas expenses and ensures capital efficiency. Heaney explained that one reason market makers appreciate this system is ‚Äúbecause they pay less gas providing JIT fills than they do placing and canceling quotes on an order book.‚Äù Swift‚Äôs model also addresses one of the biggest challenges in onchain trading: MEV, or maximal extractable value. In simple terms, MEV occurs when transactions are reordered, inserted, or censored within a block, to create profit opportunities for arbitrage bots or validators at the expense of traders. One common way this happens is through slippage. Traders set a maximum slippage limit to ensure their trade still goes through if prices move, but in many systems, market makers can immediately fill the trade at that limit to extract extra profit. Swift Protocol removes this risk by using a Dutch auction system, ‚Äúwhich means a user can‚Äôt instantly pay their max slippage. It works similar to Uniswap X and other intent protocols,‚Äù Heaney explained. Instead of letting market makers instantly fill an order at the worst possible price a trader is willing to accept, Swift forces them to compete for the best price. As good as all of this sounds, I still had to flag the protocol‚Äôs championing of staking-based order prioritization ‚Äî or the idea that orders could be prioritized based on how much of the platform‚Äôs governance token a user has staked. My issue was the possibility that deep-pocketed traders and firms would get an unfair advantage in terms of execution priority. I‚Äôm no fan of plutocratic systems. Heaney clarified that there will be no staking-based prioritization at launch, though the team is still considering how to best implement it. ‚ÄúProposed designs only provide a ‚Äòfirst look‚Äô to staked market makers, so normal market makers can still fill users as well,‚Äù he said. He went on to explain that ‚Äúin combination with the Dutch auction, a staked market maker can only fill a user first if they‚Äôre willing to give them a great price.‚Äù By collapsing execution times, removing gas fees for traders, and structuring orders to minimize MEV, Swift offers a new take on how high-performance trading can work in DeFi. If the protocol delivers on its promises, it could set the standard for how fast, efficient, and fair decentralized trading should be. The Swift Protocol is now live for perpetuals trading, with spot markets coming soon. Get the news in your inbox.

Why Focus on Enterprise Crypto Payments? The enterprise market represents a massive untapped potential for crypto payments . While retail adoption of cryptocurrencies has been growing, enterprises are now beginning to explore the advantages of digital assets, particularly stablecoins, for various use cases. Consider these compelling reasons for enterprises to embrace crypto payments: Reduced Transaction Fees: Compared to traditional payment methods like credit cards, crypto transactions, especially with stablecoins, can significantly reduce transaction fees, boosting profitability for businesses. Faster International Transactions: Cross-border payments can be cumbersome and slow with traditional systems. Crypto, and stablecoins in particular, offer near-instantaneous international transactions, streamlining global commerce for enterprises. Enhanced Security and Transparency: Blockchain technology underpinning cryptocurrencies offers enhanced security and transparency in transactions, reducing fraud and increasing trust in payment processes. Access to New Customer Base: Accepting crypto payments can open doors to a new customer base, particularly tech-savvy individuals and those in regions where traditional banking infrastructure is less developed.

His response questions narratives blending political favors with crypto business moves. The episode spotlights ongoing tensions between regulatory oversight and evolving crypto practices. Binance founder Changpeng ‚ÄúCZ‚Äù Zhao has denied a March 13 Wall Street Journal report alleging that he sought a presidential pardon from the Trump administration in exchange for a business deal involving Binance US. 4. Sorry to disappoint. The WSJ article got the facts wrong. More than 20 people have told me they were asked by the WSJ (and another media), ""Can you confirm that CZ made some deal for a pardon?"" They probably asked hundreds of people to have 20 people reach out to me. In‚Ä¶ https://t.co/ELyDPmKD3G ‚Äî CZ BNB (@cz_binance) March 13, 2025 In his X post, CZ emphasized that he had never discussed any potential Binance US deal in exchange for a pardon with anyone, directly contradicting the WSJ‚Äôs claims . Binance Co-Founder CZ Denies WSJ Pardon Claim CZ said he was aware that the Wall Street Journal had contacted multiple people about the alleged pardon request, suggesting that the publication was attempting to construct a narrative. ‚ÄúMore than 20 people have told me they were asked by the WSJ (and another media ), ‚ÄòCan you confirm that CZ made some deal for a pardon?‚Äô They probably asked hundreds of people to have 20 reach out to me,‚Äù he wrote. He added that while ‚Äúno felon would mind a pardon,‚Äù he had not discussed any Binance US deal with anyone. CZ suggested that the WSJ article is part of a broader effort to target the crypto industry and the U.S. administration. ‚ÄúFeels like the article is motivated as an attack on the President and crypto,‚Äù he stated, implying that the report was driven by lingering regulatory opposition to the sector. ‚ÄúAnd the residual forces of the ‚Äòwar on crypto‚Äô from the last administration are still at work.‚Äù Despite the allegations, CZ stated his ongoing commitment to Binance‚Äôs global crypto initiatives. Crypto Community Questions Traditional Media According to the Wall Street Journal article, CZ urged the Trump administration to grant him a pardon after entering a guilty plea in 2023. Citing anonymous sources, the article claimed that as part of a larger strategy to reenter the U.S. market, Binance had contacted Trump supporters with a business proposal involving Binance US. The report claims that after Binance‚Äôs legal issues worsened, executives started talking about a possible deal while trying to navigate regulatory barriers. Meanwhile, more people in the crypto sector are wary of traditional media, wondering if their coverage of regulatory issues is objective or biased. Some contend that rather than reflecting industry realities, coverage frequently presents events in a way that fits with larger political or financial narratives. The situation also demonstrates how difficult it is becoming for crypto businesses to continue operating globally while abiding by the law. Companies must adjust to new regulations as governments impose more oversight, and the future of the sector is increasingly being shaped by legal and regulatory actions. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs): How might CZ‚Äôs denial affect investor confidence amid regulatory scrutiny? By challenging narratives that link political favors with crypto deals, CZ‚Äôs rebuttal could temper investor worries and shift focus toward broader industry challenges, reinforcing a stance on self-regulation. What does this response reveal about the role of media in shaping crypto narratives? CZ‚Äôs rebuttal exposes how the media can amplify unverified stories, steering public discourse. This response prompts scrutiny of journalistic practices and encourages a more measured evaluation of crypto news. Could this episode signal changes in how crypto companies handle public communications? The incident may push crypto firms to refine their messaging and transparency practices. A clearer, more consistent communication strategy could help mitigate misinterpretations and restore public trust.

The RSI is at 31.33, suggesting oversold conditions, which could lead to a short-term relief bounce. However, the overall sentiment remains bearish as ETH continues making lower lows. The immediate resistance is around $2,243, while support is at $1,711. A break below this support could push ETH toward further declines, whereas a recovery above $2,000 may signal a potential reversal. Traders should watch for increased buying volume or bullish confirmations before expecting a sustained recovery from the current downward trajectory. ETH/USD 4-hour chart analysis ETH/USD 4-hour price chart Ethereum (ETH) continues its downtrend on the 4-hour chart, struggling below the 1,900 resistance. The price is near the lower Bollinger Band, indicating potential oversold conditions. The RSI hovers around 37.42, suggesting weak momentum but not yet extreme selling pressure. The MACD remains bearish, with the histogram in negative territory, reinforcing the downward bias. If ETH fails to reclaim 1,900, a further drop toward 1,821 support is possible. However, if buyers step in and push the price above 1,900, it could target 1,973. Traders should watch for volume confirmation before anticipating a significant trend reversal.

Ethereum (ETH) remains under selling pressure on both the 4-hour and 1-day charts. On the 1-day chart, ETH is trading near the lower Bollinger Band, suggesting oversold conditions, while the RSI at 34.59 confirms weak momentum. The 4-hour chart shows a similar trend, with ETH struggling below the 1,900 resistance. The MACD remains bearish, reinforcing a downside bias. If ETH fails to reclaim 1,900, further declines toward 1,821 or even 1,750 could follow. A breakout above 1,900 could trigger a recovery toward 1,973 and 2,100. Traders should monitor volume and momentum shifts before anticipating a trend reversal. Is ETH a good investment? Ethereum is the largest DeFi hub with a vibrant layer-two ecosystem in the crypto market. The blockchain constantly develops, making it a go-to choice for many Web3 developers. ETH, its native token, shows promise, and the possibility of an Ethereum ETF approval makes it favorable for day traders. Over the long term, explore our price predictions. However, the opinions expressed are not investment advice; traders should consider researching before investing. What is a realistic price for Ethereum in 2025? The realistic price for Ethereum in 2025 is around $6,224 at the maximum. What will 1 Ethereum be worth in 2030? One Ethereum is expected to be worth $41,005 maximum in 2030. How high can ETH realistically go? Ethereum‚Äôs price potential depends on multiple factors, including market trends, institutional adoption, network upgrades, and macroeconomic conditions. Realistically, ETH could reach $5,000 to $7,000 in the next bullish cycle if demand increases and Ethereum‚Äôs Layer 2 solutions and scalability improvements boost adoption. If institutional interest strengthens, ETH may push past $10,000 over the long term, especially if Ethereum remains the dominant smart contract platform. However, volatility remains a key risk, with price corrections likely along the way. Regulatory clarity and Ethereum‚Äôs shift to proof-of-stake (PoS) efficiency could also positively influence its long-term valuation. Will ETH reach $10,000? Ethereum is projected to exceed $10,000 as early as 2027, with its potential low starting at $11.383. Will ETH reach $25,000? Ethereum is predicted to surpass the $25,000 level by 2029, with an average price of $24,930 and a potential high of $30,195. This optimistic outlook is based on Ethereum‚Äôs ongoing development, network security, and increasing adoption. However, cryptocurrency markets are highly volatile, so long-term projections should be cautiously approached. Will ETH reach $40,000? Based on our analysis, Ethereum will likely reach the $40,000 mark. The highest expected price is around $41,005 in 2030. Does Ethereum have a good long-term future? Most well-known altcoins are trading at lower levels, but ETH is trading above its average price of the last two years. However, a positive outbreak can be expected. The ETH/USD pair is expected to reach the $41,005 mark by 2030, so holding it longer can be beneficial.

A similar version is also pending in the House of Representatives, and both chambers must reconcile their versions before the bill can be sent to the White House. Stablecoin Bill Faces Next Hurdle After Senate Banking Committee Approval The GENIUS Act was introduced by Senators Bill Hagerty (R-Tenn.), Kirsten Gillibrand (D-N.Y.), Cynthia Lummis (R-Wyo.), and Angela Alsobrooks (D-Md.). It defines payment stablecoins as digital assets used for transactions and pegged to a fixed monetary value. The bill sets stablecoin issuers‚Äô licensing procedures, reserve requirements, and regulatory standards. Firms holding over $10 billion in stablecoins would be federally regulated‚Äîby the Federal Reserve for depository institutions and by the Comptroller of the Currency for non-bank issuers. Issuers below this threshold would fall under state oversight, although larger issuers could apply for a waiver to remain state-regulated.

Senator Hagerty described it as a bipartisan effort to promote market competition and stability. However, some Democrats raised concerns about regulatory gaps. Senator Elizabeth Warren opposed the bill, citing potential national security risk. During the 2.5-hour hearing, she criticized the lack of additional oversight measures and referenced reports of President Donald Trump‚Äôs alleged discussions with a stablecoin firm tied to Binance. Warren‚Äôs proposed amendments, which aimed to add more regulatory controls, were rejected along partisan lines. Senator Catherine Cortez Masto (D-Nev.) also voiced concerns, arguing that the bill was incomplete and required further debate. She criticized Republican members for limiting discussions on amendments. In response, Scott defended the committee‚Äôs work, stating that extensive efforts had been made to draft a workable bill. The crypto industry has closely watched legislative developments, hoping for clearer regulatory guidelines. The previous Democratic-led Senate Banking Committee stalled similar legislation from the House, but with Republicans controlling both chambers, stablecoin regulation is now a legislative priority. The bill‚Äôs progress reflects growing bipartisan interest in setting rules for digital assets, but its final form remains uncertain as further negotiations and potential amendments lie ahead. GENIUS Act Gains Momentum as Stablecoin Regulation Battle Heats Up The GENIUS Act is gaining traction as lawmakers push for stablecoin regulations in the U.S. competing with the Clarity for Payment Stablecoins Act and the Lummis-Gillibrand Payment Stablecoin Act. It proposes a tiered regulatory system where issuers with over $10 billion in market cap, like Tether and Circle, would be federally regulated, while smaller issuers would fall under state oversight. The bill mandates monthly audited reserve reports, with penalties for false disclosures. It also aligns with the Trump administration‚Äôs pro-crypto stance, giving it bipartisan momentum. Senate staffers anticipate the bill would progress quickly through Congress. Looking forward, industry analysts predict stablecoin regulation could reshape digital asset markets. A February 2025 report noted that stablecoins now account for over 1% of the U.S. M2 money supply. However, S&P Global warns that institutional adoption will stall without clear rules. The bill‚Äôs fate now hinges on Congressional approval before it reaches President Trump‚Äôs desk. Federal Oversight and the Future of U.S. Crypto As the GENIUS Act moves closer to reality, the question remains whether its tiered regulatory approach can truly balance innovation and oversight. Will federal regulation finally provide clarity and security that institutional investors seek, or could it inadvertently leave the U.S. playing catch-up on the global stage? With the stakes rising for stablecoins‚Äîwhich already represent over 1% of the U.S. money supply‚Äîthe coming debates in Congress will determine not only the trajectory of digital assets domestically, but also America‚Äôs competitive role in the global financial ecosystem. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) How might these rules affect market practices? The new regulation could prompt stablecoin issuers to improve internal controls and reserve management, leading to more disciplined market practices while offering consumers clearer insights into digital asset stability. What does the bill mean for state-level oversight of digital assets? The bill creates a framework where state regulators oversee smaller issuers while larger ones fall under federal supervision, promoting consistency, transparency, and reliability in digital asset operations. How will these rules impact crypto innovation and safety? How will these rules affect crypto innovation and safety? Market participants must examine if uniform guidelines reduce flexibility while securing operations on various digital finance platforms.

Abstract , an Ethereum layer-2 blockchain developed by Igloo, the parent company of NFT collection Pudgy Penguins , led all chains with a growth of over 20,000% in daily active unique wallets (dAUWs). Soneium , Sony‚Äôs Ethereum L2 blockchain, came in second with a growth of over 3,200%, and Linea , another L2 blockchain, placed third with over 1,000% growth. Monthly growth of unique active wallets across blockchains. Source: DappRadar On Abstract and Soneium, two games were the primary drivers of activity growth: Treasure Ship on Abstract, which currently has around 72,000 UAWs, and Evermoon on Soneium, with approximately 32,000 UAWs. However, despite the rise of gaming activity on L2s, dUAWs overall dropped by 16% compared to January, settling at around 5.8 million. The report notes that while blockchain gaming ‚Äúhas historically held strong market dominance, economic conditions have shifted investor focus back towards DeFi. With market uncertainty causing traders to exit positions, DeFi now leads as the most dominant sector.‚Äù The most dominant blockchains for gaming in terms of dUAWs are opBNB, a layer-2 blockchain built on top of the BNB Smart Chain; independent layer-1 blockchain Aptos built for decentralized applications; and Nebula, which is a Skale chain. According to the report, blockchain gaming investments soared to $55 million in February, marking a 243% increase from January, with 92% of the funds allocated to infrastructure development. Blockchain gaming activity sees year-over-year growth, but challenges persist As Cointelegraph reported in February, blockchain gaming activity saw a significant year-over-year surge , with daily unique active wallets soaring by 386% to 7 million. The sharp rise led some industry observers to speculate about a potential blockchain gaming bull run in 2025 ‚Äî though that prospect is now under debate. One of the games that had been drawing attention to the use of blockchains in games was ‚ÄúOff The Grid.‚Äù The title, which plans to use an Avalanche subnet, generated more than 100 million transactions in its first month. The sector, however, has faced challenges. Gunzilla Games Web3 director Theodore Agranat told Cointelegraph that there ‚Äúis no new money coming into the system,‚Äù explaining that existing capital is just being recycled between gaming projects. ‚ÄúThey will just go from project to project and extract whatever value they can from that project,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúAnd once there‚Äôs no more value to be had there, they are going to move on to another project.‚Äù Magazine: Web3 Gamer: How AI could ruin gaming, The Voice, addictive Axies game",,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|ETH|MARKET|APT|BNB,"{'name': 'CoinTelegraph', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cointelegraph.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cointelegraph,2025-03-13 20:59:54

The signed order will ensure the Treasury treats Bitcoin as a national reserve asset. According to the announcement, the digital stockpile will comprise other digital assets such as Bitcoin, Ethereum and Cardano. The U.S. president directed the Department of Treasury to formulate the stockpile using forfeited digital assets from criminal or civil proceedings. Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies continued experiencing volatility even after the executive order. Coinmarketcap data revealed Bitcoin registered a 6% decline while Cardano declined by 4% after the president‚Äôs address. Investors could be eyeing a new digital platform promising massive potential gains in the next few months. Cardano registers price decline despite Trump‚Äôs announcement Investors have raised concerns about whether the government would purchase more crypto assets while setting up the U.S. Treasury digital reserve stockpile. Adding Cardano to the digital stockpile brought mainstream attention to its long-run potential in the crypto ecosystem. The announcement came as financial institutions seek projects offering more scalability and innovation. In the ever-evolving crypto market, investors prefer projects that have not yet grown to massive market caps to make more profit. Cardano is already an established project and needs more liquidity to make significant gains for investors. As ADA declines amid Trump‚Äôs announcement, Cardano investors have found a hidden gem promising the first-ever hybrid crypto exchange platform . The new project has an ongoing token presale that opens up investments from both retail and institutional investors. BinoFi steals the altcoin spotlight amid market tumble BinoFI is a hybrid exchange model offering traders and DeFi users an improved cross-exchange protocol that leverages the valuable features of centralized and decentralized exchanges in one platform. The project combines centralized exchange efficiency with decentralized finance security to yield a powerful crypto exchange platform for trading and investing activities. BinoFi addresses user privacy and liquidity fragmentation within the crypto ecosystem. The project began the first presale phase of its native token, BINO, a few weeks ago. The project‚Äôs team revealed that it sold over 10 million tokens so far as more investors join the trend. The sales signal the token‚Äôs increased investor demand. The project‚Äôs second phase is set to commence soon with a slightly higher BINO price from the current phase‚Äôs price of $0.02. BinoFi‚Äôs Zero-Knowledge (ZK) know-your-customer (KYC) model sets the project apart from other DeFi ecosystems. Crypto projects such as Cardano grapple with regulatory compliance requirements across numerous jurisdictions. The project‚Äôs (ZK) KYC enables users to comply with the disclosure requirements without collecting and exposing their personal data. BinoFi‚Äôs deflationary mechanism promises massive gains to long-term BINO holders BinoFi has a buyback and burn mechanism that controls BINO‚Äôs scarcity by continuously reducing its supply over time. Deflationary tokenomics ensures the crypto asset maintains its long-term value as supply cuts and demand increases. Early adopters are set to reap the most benefits in the long run following constant supply cuts and periodic demand surges. Experts recommend investing in projects early in advance before they grow their market caps. BinoFi‚Äôs current presale price is $0.02, and its projected listing value is $0.3. The price difference means buying BINO tokens now could mean investors will make a 1200% ROI in the next few months. The price difference makes the project attractive to investors who seek massive gains in emerging projects. BinoFi presents its users with a well-established hybrid crypto exchange platform with a greater likelihood of massive institutional backing than Cardano. Recent activity in the crypto market illustrates that the inclusion of Bitcoin and other digital assets as a reserve currency in the United States might not be the needed catalyst for price surges. Forelooking investors should ensure this unique opportunity does not pass before they position themselves for the high reward potential BinoFi offers.

The U.S. Senate Banking Committee is set to hold its first markup of the highly anticipated stablecoin bill , officially known as the GENIUS Act. This is a major step forward in the ongoing discussion and potential regulation of digital assets in the United States. For anyone invested in cryptocurrencies or following the regulatory landscape, this development is crucial to watch. What is the GENIUS Act and Why Does it Matter for Crypto Regulation? The GENIUS Act, short for yet-to-be-officially-announced full name, is a proposed piece of legislation aimed at establishing a regulatory framework for stablecoins. Stablecoins, a type of cryptocurrency designed to maintain a stable value, often pegged to fiat currencies like the US dollar, have become increasingly important in the crypto ecosystem. They facilitate trading, provide stability in volatile markets, and are used in various decentralized finance (DeFi) applications. However, their rapid growth and potential systemic risks have caught the attention of regulators worldwide, including in the U.S. Here‚Äôs why the GENIUS Act and this markup are significant: Clarity for Stablecoins: The Act aims to provide much-needed clarity on how stablecoins will be regulated in the U.S. Currently, the regulatory landscape is fragmented, leading to uncertainty and hindering wider adoption. Investor Protection: Regulation can bring in investor protection measures, ensuring that stablecoin issuers maintain adequate reserves and operate transparently, reducing risks for users. Market Stability: Proper regulation can contribute to the overall stability of the cryptocurrency market by addressing potential risks associated with stablecoins, such as runs or failures. Innovation and Growth: A well-designed regulatory framework can foster innovation and growth in the digital asset space by providing a clear path for businesses to operate within the law. Senate Banking Committee to Discuss Crypto Regulation: What to Expect? The Senate Banking Committee , chaired by Senator Sherrod Brown, is responsible for overseeing financial institutions and markets, making it the key committee for cryptocurrency regulation discussions in the Senate. The first markup of the GENIUS Act is a critical procedural step. It‚Äôs essentially the first time the committee members will formally debate and potentially amend the bill. According to Eleanor Terrett, a Fox Business reporter, the markup is scheduled for 10:00 a.m. local time and will be live-streamed on the committee‚Äôs official X (formerly Twitter) account. This transparency is a positive sign, allowing the public and crypto community to follow the discussions in real-time. What can we anticipate from this markup? Committee Deliberation: Senators on the committee will likely discuss various aspects of the GENIUS Act, raising questions, proposing amendments, and debating the merits of different approaches to stablecoin regulation. Potential Amendments: This is the stage where amendments to the bill can be proposed and voted on. These amendments could significantly alter the final form of the legislation. Keep an eye on potential changes to definitions, regulatory responsibilities, and compliance requirements. Bipartisan Support (or Lack Thereof): The level of bipartisan support for the bill will be crucial. Strong bipartisan backing increases the likelihood of the bill progressing through the Senate and eventually becoming law. Watch for signals of agreement or disagreement between Republican and Democratic senators on the committee. Industry Feedback: While not directly part of the markup, the senators will likely consider feedback from the cryptocurrency industry, regulatory bodies, and other stakeholders. Industry groups have been actively lobbying and providing input on stablecoin regulation, and their perspectives will likely influence the discussions. The GENIUS Act: Benefits and Challenges of Stablecoin Legislation Enacting the GENIUS Act as law could bring several benefits to the crypto ecosystem and the broader financial system, but also presents certain challenges. Potential Benefits: Enhanced Legitimacy for Digital Assets: Clear regulation can bring greater legitimacy to the digital asset space, encouraging institutional adoption and wider public acceptance. Reduced Systemic Risk: By regulating stablecoin issuers, the Act can mitigate systemic risks that could potentially impact the broader financial system. Consumer Confidence: Clear rules and oversight can boost consumer confidence in stablecoins and the crypto market in general, encouraging participation. Level Playing Field: Regulation can help create a level playing field for stablecoin issuers, preventing regulatory arbitrage and promoting fair competition. Potential Challenges: Innovation Stifling: Overly strict or poorly designed regulations could stifle innovation in the rapidly evolving crypto space. It‚Äôs crucial to strike a balance between regulation and fostering innovation. Compliance Burdens: Complex or costly compliance requirements could disproportionately affect smaller stablecoin issuers and startups, potentially hindering competition. Enforcement Difficulties: Enforcing regulations in the decentralized and global nature of cryptocurrencies can be challenging. International cooperation and effective enforcement mechanisms will be necessary. Defining ‚ÄúStablecoin‚Äù and Scope: Precisely defining what constitutes a ‚Äústablecoin‚Äù and determining the scope of regulation can be complex, given the various types of stablecoins and their underlying mechanisms. Actionable Insights: How to Stay Informed About Crypto Regulation For anyone involved or interested in cryptocurrencies, staying informed about regulatory developments like the GENIUS Act is paramount. Here are some actionable steps: Follow the Senate Banking Committee: Keep an eye on the committee‚Äôs official X account for live updates and announcements. You can also check their website for schedules, documents, and summaries of proceedings. Monitor Crypto News Outlets: Reputable cryptocurrency news websites and reporters like Eleanor Terrett provide timely and in-depth coverage of regulatory developments. Engage with Crypto Communities: Participate in online forums, social media groups, and discussions within the crypto community to exchange information and insights on regulatory matters. Understand the Legislation: When the text of the GENIUS Act becomes publicly available, take the time to read and understand its key provisions and implications. Consider Industry Perspectives: Pay attention to the views and analyses from crypto industry associations, legal experts, and think tanks on the proposed regulations. Conclusion: A Pivotal Moment for Crypto and Digital Assets The U.S. Senate Banking Committee‚Äôs first markup of the GENIUS Act represents a pivotal moment for the future of crypto regulation and digital assets in the United States. This is a crucial step towards establishing a clearer regulatory framework for stablecoins, which could have significant implications for the entire cryptocurrency market. By providing regulatory clarity, fostering investor protection, and promoting market stability, the GENIUS Act has the potential to shape the future of digital finance in the U.S. The crypto community and stakeholders should closely monitor the proceedings of the markup and engage in constructive dialogue to ensure that the final legislation is both effective and conducive to innovation. The outcome of these discussions will undoubtedly have a lasting impact on the trajectory of the cryptocurrency industry.

33767162,[object Object],1741899607,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/33767162.jpeg,Coinbase CEO: US Bitcoin Reserve Shift Sparks Global Crypto Adoption,https://bitcoinist.com/coinbase-ceo-us-bitcoin-reserve-shift-sparks-global-crypto-adoption/,"According to Brian Armstrong, CEO of Coinbase , more governments are beginning to recognize cryptocurrencies. He made this disclosure as the US government establishes a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve to bolster its holdings in digital assets. The exchange now offers services like trading, custody, and blockchain infrastructure to 145 US federal institutions and 29 foreign organizations. These collaborations imply that governments are searching for methods to include cryptocurrency into their financial frameworks. Armstrong believes that regulators‚Äô recognition of the security and transparency advantages of blockchain technology is the reason for this change. Interest In US Strategic Bitcoin Reserve Up A Strategic Bitcoin Reserve was recently established by the US government with the goal of managing Bitcoin assets that have been seized by federal authorities. As part of its financial strategy, some see this as a step toward the government owning cryptocurrency. Others think it would provide more efficient regulation and oversight of digital assets. Across federal, state, and local, Coinbase now works with 145 government entities in the U.S. and 29 government entities outside the U.S. In the wake of the U.S. Strategic Bitcoin Reserve launching, we‚Äôre seeing many more take an interest. We‚Äôd like to help everyone custody,‚Ä¶ pic.twitter.com/2R0Dy3BuHe ‚Äî Brian Armstrong (@brian_armstrong) March 12, 2025 The reserve has drawn attention from other nations as well. Some governments are considering the usage and storage of digital currencies in their own financial systems. Armstrong believes that this could eventually lead to a greater use of cryptocurrencies by government agencies. Coinbase Role In The Growing Adoption Of Crypto Coinbase has grown into a major service provider as more government bodies look into digital assets. Businesses from all over the world can use the company‚Äôs storage options, trade services, and blockchain support. Armstrong said these collaborations show that governments are starting to pay attention to cryptocurrencies and that the field is no longer a niche one. Despite ongoing regulatory issues, the fact that bitcoin is finding its way into the hands of government agencies demonstrates its gradual integration into conventional financial institutions. Governments are still debating policies, but their involvement in blockchain development reveals a shift in perspective. What The Future May Hold For Coinbase As more institutions look into digital currencies, the relationship between governments and cryptocurrency startups like Coinbase is likely to increase. Some experts believe that this could lead to more transparent regulations and better security measures for digital assets. Some argue that regulating cryptocurrencies could limit their decentralized nature. Armstrong remains optimistic . According to him, governments‚Äô growing interest shows that cryptocurrencies are more than just a passing trend; they are a realistic financial tool with real-world applications. Whether this means more institutional involvement or more stringent oversight, it is clear that crypto is becoming harder to ignore.

This Token Has a Higher Potential Than Ripple (XRP), Solana (SOL), and Dogecoin (DOGE)",https://timestabloid.com/where-to-invest-500-in-crypto-right-now-this-token-has-a-higher/,"The crypto industry has proven to be a lucrative venture that can turn small investments into generational wealth. So far, only a handful of projects have provided their investors with such returns. BinoFi is among the projects that recently caught investors‚Äô interest as a high-potential crypto gem. Analysts suggest its native token, BINO , could outperform Dogecoin, Solana and XRP in 2025. The experts add that the token offers 100x profit potential in the near future once its presale ends and the token is listed on major exchanges, driving users to its upcoming hybrid crypto exchange as well. Analysts recommend investing in projects during their nascent stages Projects such as Solana, Dogecoin and XRP have already established their dominance in the industry with impressive market caps. The assets delivered significant gains to early investors. Experts recommend making investments in assets with smaller market caps. They add that these projects always experience substantial surges in the long run that translate to high returns for early adopters. Solana, XRP, and Dogecoin experienced price plummets as the rest of the market responded to the economic uncertainties. Investors suffered significant losses amid the market tumble. Investors now seek emerging tokens with higher growth potential rather than well established projects. A small investment in the right asset can set an investor portfolio apart by generating massive returns. Analysts highlight that early investors who jumped into the altcoin bandwagon with assets such as Solana and XRP turned their small investments into millions. Given BINO‚Äôs unique features, the experts suggest that the token could outperform major altcoins such as Solana. A $500 investment in BinoFI could turn into generational wealth for BinoFi adopters. The project‚Äôs team revealed that the new DeFi project sold over 10 million tokens in its first presale phase. The increased token sales indicate high demand from early investors who seek to position themselves for the project‚Äôs potential boom. BINO stands out in the crypto ecosystem as a high-return asset BinoFi offers a hybrid exchange model that has yet to revolutionize crypto trading. The model combines useful features from centralized and decentralized exchanges. Investors can now enjoy low transaction fees witnessed on centralized exchanges and high-security features from decentralized exchanges within the same trading platform. Projects like Solana dominated the crypto ecosystem due to their utility in smart contracts. BinoFi, on the other hand, provides users with scalable trading solutions. BinoFi‚Äôs deflationary tokenomics ensures that the token‚Äôs supply decreases over time. A decrease in supply with increased demand will lead to a price surge. This feature distinguishes the token from assets such as Dogecoin which have an unlimited supply that stunts price growth. How to purchase BINO tokens Bino tokens are still in their initial presale phase, exchanging hands for $0.02. The developers revealed the token‚Äôs price would increase progressively after every presale. Investors who want to make massive gains from their little investments should take this opportunity to purchase the tokens when the price is still affordable. Analysts predict that BINO‚Äôs price will skyrocket after it is listed on major exchanges. Investors can visit BinoFi‚Äôs official website today and get the tokens at affordable prices. They can also purchase the tokens using USDT, USDC or ETH in their preferred wallets. The tokens will be readily available in their wallets after purchase. However, they cannot be traded until the official listing.

According to CNN , the cuts would impact an estimated 6,800 employees at the government agency, in addition to the 6,700 probationary employees who have already been let go and 4,700 IRS agents who were given severance packages to retire. However, a recent ruling from US district judge William Alsup ordering federal agencies to reinstate probationary workers terminated due to the DOGE cost-cutting programs could hinder the layoffs if the order is not overturned.

One of the more unique measures proposed included putting all public spending onchain to reduce deficits and ensure transparency. On Feb. 21, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) announced it was cutting its regional office directors to comply with the Trump administration‚Äôs cost-saving directives.

Research from accounting automation company Dancing Numbers argued that Trump‚Äôs plan to eliminate federal income tax could save the average American $134,809 in taxes throughout their lives. The company added that these lifetime tax savings could extend to as much as $325,561 per person if other wage-based taxes at the state level are also repealed. Despite this, not everyone is convinced by DOGE‚Äôs cost-cutting tactics, including US Senator Elizabeth Warren, who is highly critical of Elon Musk, Trump, and DOGE. In January 2025, the Massachusetts Senator sent a letter to the DOGE proposing increasing taxes and federal spending to make the government more efficient.

41609841,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=139916,1741900204,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Strategic Shift: Circle Moves Tokenized Money Market Fund to Bermuda Jurisdiction,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/circle-moves-bermuda-jurisdiction/,"In a revealing development for the cryptocurrency landscape, Circle, the powerhouse behind the popular USDC stablecoin, is making a significant jurisdictional shift. According to recent reports, Circle plans to relocate its newly acquired Hashnote Tokenized Money Market Fund (TMMF) to Bermuda. This move signals a strategic pivot in how digital asset firms are navigating global regulations and operational landscapes. But what exactly does this mean for the future of tokenized assets and the broader crypto ecosystem? Let‚Äôs dive deep into the details of this intriguing development. What is a Tokenized Money Market Fund and Why Bermuda Jurisdiction? Before we delve into the specifics of Circle‚Äôs move, it‚Äôs crucial to understand what a Tokenized Money Market Fund actually is. In essence, a Tokenized Money Market Fund represents a traditional money market fund but operates on a blockchain. This innovative approach tokenizes shares of the fund, making them accessible and tradable as digital assets. Think of it as bridging the gap between traditional finance and the burgeoning world of decentralized finance (DeFi). Now, why Bermuda? Bermuda has been proactively positioning itself as a hub for digital assets, known for its relatively favorable and clear regulatory environment. This jurisdiction offers a blend of innovation-friendly policies and regulatory oversight, which can be attractive for companies in the crypto space. Here‚Äôs a breakdown of why Bermuda might be appealing for Circle‚Äôs Tokenized Money Market Fund : Regulatory Clarity: Bermuda has established a comprehensive legal framework for digital assets, offering businesses a clear understanding of compliance requirements. This reduces uncertainty and fosters a more predictable operating environment. Innovation-Friendly Approach: The Bermudian government has shown a willingness to embrace technological innovation, creating a welcoming atmosphere for crypto and blockchain companies. Tax Advantages: Bermuda is known for its tax-neutral status, which can be financially beneficial for businesses, especially those dealing with global operations. Reputation and Stability: Despite being an offshore jurisdiction, Bermuda has a strong reputation as a well-regulated and stable financial center. For Circle, moving the Hashnote Tokenized Money Market Fund to Bermuda could be a strategic decision to optimize operations, leverage a favorable regulatory environment, and potentially expand its global reach in the tokenized asset market. Decoding Circle‚Äôs Plan: The Strategic Significance of Bermuda Jurisdiction The choice of Bermuda jurisdiction isn‚Äôt arbitrary. It reflects a calculated move by Circle to position itself advantageously in the evolving landscape of digital finance. Relocating the Hashnote TMMF to Bermuda underscores several key strategic considerations for Circle: Global Expansion: Operating from Bermuda can provide Circle with a more internationally focused platform, potentially facilitating access to markets and investors beyond the United States. Regulatory Arbitrage (Strategic Optimization): While not necessarily about avoiding regulations, choosing Bermuda allows Circle to operate under a regulatory regime that is specifically designed for digital assets, which might be more streamlined and adaptable than regulations in other major jurisdictions. Focus on Innovation: By situating the TMMF in a jurisdiction known for fostering innovation, Circle can signal its commitment to pushing the boundaries of digital finance and exploring new opportunities within the tokenized asset space. Risk Management: Diversifying jurisdictional exposure can also be a part of a broader risk management strategy, mitigating potential over-reliance on any single regulatory environment. This move could also be interpreted as a proactive step in anticipation of potentially stricter regulatory landscapes in other major financial centers. By establishing a presence in a crypto-friendly Bermuda jurisdiction , Circle is ensuring operational flexibility and adaptability in a rapidly changing regulatory world. Navigating Global Landscapes: Circle USDC and Stablecoin Regulation Circle‚Äôs core business revolves around Circle USDC , a leading stablecoin pegged to the US dollar. Stablecoins are under increasing scrutiny from regulators worldwide, as they play a crucial role in the crypto ecosystem and have the potential to impact traditional financial systems. The decision to move the Hashnote TMMF to Bermuda needs to be viewed within the context of global stablecoin regulation . Here‚Äôs how this move might relate to the broader regulatory environment for Circle USDC and stablecoins: Geopolitical Diversification: As regulatory pressures on stablecoins intensify in various jurisdictions, operating a part of its business from Bermuda could offer Circle a degree of geopolitical diversification. Future-Proofing Operations: By engaging with a jurisdiction that is actively developing crypto regulations, Circle can gain valuable insights and potentially shape future regulatory frameworks. Demonstrating Compliance: Operating within Bermuda‚Äôs regulatory framework can showcase Circle‚Äôs commitment to compliance and responsible innovation, which is crucial for building trust with regulators and users alike. The regulatory landscape for stablecoins is still evolving, with ongoing discussions and developments in the US, Europe, and Asia. Circle‚Äôs strategic move to Bermuda jurisdiction for its Tokenized Money Market Fund might be a calculated step to navigate this complex and dynamic regulatory environment effectively. Unpacking the Benefits of Offshore Crypto Operations for Circle The term ‚Äúoffshore‚Äù can sometimes carry negative connotations, but in the context of cryptocurrency and digital assets, operating offshore crypto businesses can offer legitimate and strategic advantages. For Circle, leveraging an offshore jurisdiction like Bermuda for its Tokenized Money Market Fund could unlock several benefits: Benefit Description Operational Efficiency Potentially streamlined regulatory processes and lower operational costs in a jurisdiction designed for digital assets. Market Access Improved access to international markets and investors who may be more comfortable with or specifically seeking offshore investment opportunities. Regulatory Sandbox Environment Bermuda‚Äôs regulatory framework can act as a sandbox, allowing Circle to test and refine innovative financial products in a controlled and supportive environment. Enhanced Privacy (within legal limits) While compliance is paramount, certain offshore jurisdictions may offer different levels of data privacy and confidentiality compared to onshore locations. It‚Äôs important to emphasize that operating offshore crypto businesses must adhere to all applicable international laws and regulations, including anti-money laundering (AML) and know-your-customer (KYC) requirements. Strategic offshore operations, when conducted responsibly and compliantly, can be a powerful tool for crypto companies seeking to innovate and expand globally. Implications and the Future of Tokenized Assets Circle‚Äôs move to Bermuda for its Hashnote Tokenized Money Market Fund is more than just a jurisdictional shift; it‚Äôs a significant indicator of the growing maturity and strategic thinking within the tokenized asset space. This development carries several implications for the future of tokenized assets and the broader financial industry: Mainstream Adoption: Moves like this can contribute to the mainstream adoption of tokenized assets by demonstrating that established financial players are actively engaging with and investing in this technology. Regulatory Convergence: The increasing interest in jurisdictions like Bermuda could encourage other countries to develop clearer and more supportive regulatory frameworks for digital assets, leading to a degree of global regulatory convergence. Innovation in Financial Products: By operating in innovation-friendly jurisdictions, companies like Circle can accelerate the development of new and sophisticated tokenized financial products, expanding the possibilities of DeFi and traditional finance integration. Increased Competition: As more companies explore offshore jurisdictions for their crypto operations, we can expect increased competition among these jurisdictions to attract digital asset businesses. In conclusion, Circle‚Äôs strategic decision to relocate the Hashnote Tokenized Money Market Fund to Bermuda is a noteworthy event in the cryptocurrency world. It highlights the increasing importance of jurisdictional strategy, regulatory navigation, and the ongoing evolution of tokenized assets. This move could pave the way for more established financial institutions to explore similar pathways, further shaping the future of finance.

As the settlement negotiation progresses, new updates on the causes of delays have emerged. According to Fox Business Senior Correspondent Charles Gasparino, the Ethereum ICO might be a factor in determining the settlement terms. The Ethereum Reference in Ripple SEC Lawsuit As stated in a scoop on X , Gasparino said one of the primary issues under consideration is how XRP will be classified after the lawsuit. According to him, the parties are exploring whether it will trade as a utility, thus removing the securities tag. Citing his anonymous sources, Gasparino noted that Ethereum is a major example of being profiled. In its earlier days, it also conducted an Initial Coin Offering (ICO) like XRP. The scoop also noted that the characteristics of its issuance were not different from that of XRP. Both protocols raised money to finance the development of a platform. Despite this, Ripple Labs was sued by the US SEC as the claims hinged on how Ethereum had morphed into a commodity. According to the update, the market regulator is considering whether it can make a similar commodity case for XRP. Community Reacts to the New Ripple SEC Lawsuit Update Recall that the potential XRP lawsuit settlement news came earlier this week after Eleanor Terrett confirmed internal talks. However, the latest updates have triggered a new round of reactions from the community. Ripple Labs CTO David Schwartz explained the disadvantages of XRP. He noted that, unlike XRP, ETH was privately sold by an issuer before any innovator designed a ledger or blockchain. Other community members have also argued the case for XRP, noting that the coin is not a security. Experts noted that once these conditions are ironed out, Ripple Labs may also see its case settled as the regulator closed the Coinbase lawsuit earlier this month. Potential Implications of the XRP Lawsuit Dismissal Despite the lingering legal battle, many asset managers have moved to launch XRP-based exchange-traded funds in the US. Considering the complexity of its security status, Bloomberg Senior ETF Analysts Eric Balchunas and James Seyffart pegged the XRP ETF approval odds at 60%. If this lawsuit is resolved in the coming weeks, it might boost the odds of approval of the XRP ETF soon. In addition, the case dismissal can trigger a massive XRP price rally , per an earlier CoinGape analysis.

41610278,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=139917,1741900801,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Urgent Plea: OpenAI Demands ‚ÄòFair Use‚Äô Shield for AI Training Revolution,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/openai-demands-fair-use-ai-training/,"The AI world is buzzing with OpenAI‚Äôs latest move. The company behind groundbreaking models like ChatGPT is pushing for a significant shift in how U.S. copyright law applies to AI training . In a bold proposal to the Trump Administration‚Äôs ‚ÄòAI Action Plan,‚Äô OpenAI is advocating for the government to officially recognize ‚Äò fair use ‚Äò principles in the context of training artificial intelligence. This could have massive implications for the future of AI development, especially in the face of growing copyright concerns. Why is OpenAI Pushing for ‚ÄòFair Use‚Äô in AI Training? OpenAI argues that the current ‚Äò fair use ‚Äò doctrine is crucial to the vibrant AI ecosystem in America. They state that the U.S.‚Äôs leadership in AI innovation ‚Äì from startups to research breakthroughs ‚Äì is largely thanks to the permissive environment fostered by fair use . In their proposal, OpenAI emphasizes the need to ‚Äò[preserve] American AI models‚Äô ability to learn from copyrighted material.‚Äô Essentially, they believe that restricting access to copyrighted material for AI training would stifle innovation and put American AI development at a disadvantage. To put it simply, OpenAI fears that without a clear legal framework for fair use in AI training , the U.S. could lose its competitive edge in the rapidly evolving world of artificial intelligence. What Exactly is ‚ÄòFair Use‚Äô and Why Does it Matter for AI? Fair use is a legal doctrine in the United States that permits limited use of copyrighted material without needing permission from the copyright holder. This is typically for purposes like criticism, commentary, news reporting, teaching, scholarship, or research. The crucial question now is whether training AI models falls under this umbrella, especially when these models are trained on vast datasets that often include copyrighted works. OpenAI believes it should. They argue that AI training is transformative and falls within the spirit of fair use , enabling the creation of new, innovative technologies. However, this stance is not without controversy. The Copyright Clash: Who is Challenging OpenAI? Content owners, particularly those in creative industries, are increasingly concerned about the use of their copyrighted material for AI training without consent or compensation. Several lawsuits have already been filed against OpenAI and other AI developers, alleging copyright infringement. These content creators argue that using their work to train AI models is not ‚Äò fair use ‚Äò and deprives them of potential revenue and control over their intellectual property. The core of the dispute lies in differing interpretations of copyright law in the digital age. Traditional copyright law was not designed with AI in mind, and the application of ‚Äò fair use ‚Äò to machine learning is a complex and evolving legal area. OpenAI‚Äôs Stance: A Necessary Step for AI Progress or Overreach? OpenAI maintains that limiting AI training to only public domain content would severely hinder the development of advanced AI systems. They argue that such a restriction would result in AI that fails to meet the needs of today‚Äôs citizens, limiting the potential benefits of AI across various sectors. In a submission to the U.K.‚Äôs House of Lords last year, OpenAI explicitly stated that restricting training data to public domain content alone ‚Äòmight yield an interesting experiment, but would not provide AI systems that meet the needs of today‚Äôs citizens.‚Äô This highlights the tension between fostering innovation in AI policy and protecting the rights of content creators. Finding the right balance is crucial for ensuring both continued progress in AI and a sustainable ecosystem for creative industries. Global Implications: How Does US Copyright Law Impact International AI Development? The U.S.‚Äôs approach to copyright law and AI policy has global implications. As a leader in AI innovation, the legal precedents set in the U.S. often influence international standards and regulations. If the U.S. government codifies ‚Äò fair use ‚Äò for AI training , it could encourage other nations to adopt similar policies, potentially shaping the global landscape of AI development and copyright law . Conversely, a more restrictive approach in the U.S. could lead to a divergence in global AI policies, creating different legal environments for AI development in various regions. This could impact where AI companies choose to operate and innovate. Key Takeaways: Navigating the Future of AI and Copyright OpenAI‚Äôs Advocacy : OpenAI is actively lobbying for the U.S. government to codify ‚Äò fair use ‚Äò for AI training , arguing it‚Äôs essential for continued AI innovation. Copyright Concerns : Content owners are challenging this stance, citing copyright infringement and demanding compensation for the use of their works in AI training . Legal Uncertainty : The application of ‚Äò fair use ‚Äò to AI training is a legally complex and evolving area, with significant implications for the future of AI development and copyright law . Global Impact : The U.S.‚Äôs decision on this matter could set a precedent for international AI policy and copyright law . Balancing Innovation and Rights : Finding a balance between promoting AI innovation and protecting the rights of content creators is crucial for a sustainable and equitable future for both AI and creative industries. The debate around ‚Äò fair use ‚Äò and AI training is far from over. It represents a critical juncture in the evolution of both AI policy and copyright law , with potentially profound consequences for the future of technology and creative expression.

Reportedly, the crypto firms have unstaked and moved 185,345 Solana (SOL) tokens, worth about $22.9 million, to 38 different wallets within the past day. Blockchain analytics platforms SpotOnChain and Arkham Intelligence confirmed the transactions, noting that the recipient wallets now collectively hold about $178.82 million in SOL. This development affected Solana‚Äôs market value. FTX Has Been Selling SOL on Major Exchanges On-chain data has shown that this recent move is not the first time FTX has made large SOL transfers. The exchange unlocked 3.03 million SOL earlier in March, worth around $432.5 million. The digital assets were reportedly distributed to multiple wallets. Since November 2023, FTX and Alameda have unstaked roughly 8.019 million SOL, valued at nearly $1 billion. It was revealed a massive portion of the unstaked SOL was sold on crypto exchanges such as Coinbase and Binance. The average selling price was $125.8 per token that year. Despite these large sales, FTX and Alameda still hold 5.5 million SOL, valued at about $693.8 million. These asset movements are part of FTX‚Äôs ongoing efforts to repay its creditors. FTX Creditors Are Receiving Payments, But Some Are Left Out FTX has already started repaying some creditors. In January, claimants below $50,000 received full compensation, including 9% annual interest on their claims. This repayment round resulted in $1.2 billion in withdrawals from FTX-controlled wallets. Kraken, one of the exchanges helping with the payouts, confirmed that the next phase will begin on May 30 . This round will focus on larger creditors with claims exceeding $50,000. However, not all creditors are benefiting from these repayments. Due to jurisdiction challenges, those in countries like China, Russia, Egypt, Nigeria, and Ukraine have yet to receive funds. FTX Unstaking Event Impacted Solana‚Äôs Price This latest unstaking event had hurt SOL‚Äôs price as the token is now trading at $122.24, down by 2. 24% in the last 24 hours, according to CoinMarketCap data. Notably, the popular token is down approximately 58.42% from its All-Time High (ATH) of $294. Meanwhile, many analysts have forecast bullish and bearish price action for Solana, with some suggesting the digital asset could reach $187.16 by December 2025 and possibly $531.48 by 2030. Some experts think it could fall to $114.95 by March 2025, but predictions for the future are very different. The market is very unstable, making investors uncertain about what will happen next.

Aave Labs, the powerhouse behind the popular Aave lending protocol, has just dropped a bombshell: Horizon . This isn‚Äôt just another upgrade; it‚Äôs a strategic initiative designed to bridge the gap between traditional finance and the burgeoning world of DeFi by bringing Real World Assets (RWAs) into the mix. Imagine institutions leveraging tokenized money market funds within DeFi ‚Äì that‚Äôs the bold vision Horizon is set to realize. Let‚Äôs dive into how this game-changing proposal could reshape the future of finance. What is Aave Horizon and Why is it a Revolutionary Step for DeFi? Horizon is not just a fancy name; it represents a fundamental shift in how we perceive and utilize decentralized finance. In essence, Aave Labs is proposing a regulated pathway to integrate Real World Assets into the Aave ecosystem. This initiative, if greenlit by the Aave DAO, will launch as a licensed instance of Aave V3, with a clear roadmap to transition to the highly anticipated Aave V4. But why is this such a big deal for the world of DeFi ? Expanded Liquidity: By allowing institutions to use tokenized money market funds as collateral, Horizon unlocks a massive new pool of liquidity for the DeFi space. This injection of capital can lead to more robust and efficient markets. Institutional Adoption: Horizon is specifically designed to cater to institutions. By operating within a regulated framework, it addresses a key barrier that has kept many institutional players on the sidelines of DeFi. This could be the catalyst for widespread institutional adoption of decentralized finance. Enhanced Utility for RWAs: Real World Assets, which have often been touted as the next frontier for DeFi, finally get a practical and scalable use case within a leading protocol like Aave. Tokenized assets can now generate yield and participate in the dynamic DeFi ecosystem. Growth for Aave Ecosystem: The proposal includes a significant 50% revenue share for the Aave DAO in the first year, and potentially a 15% token allocation to the DAO treasury. This directly benefits the Aave community and strengthens the protocol‚Äôs long-term sustainability. How Will Real World Assets Transform Decentralized Finance? The integration of Real World Assets (RWAs) is frequently discussed as the key to unlocking the next phase of growth for decentralized finance. But what exactly are RWAs, and why are they so crucial? RWAs are essentially assets that originate in the traditional financial system ‚Äì think stocks, bonds, real estate, commodities ‚Äì and are then tokenized on a blockchain. Horizon focuses initially on tokenized money market funds (MMFs), which are low-risk, highly liquid instruments. Here‚Äôs why this focus on RWAs is transformative: Bridges Traditional and Decentralized Finance: RWAs act as a bridge, connecting the vast capital pools of traditional finance with the innovative and efficient infrastructure of DeFi. Diversification for DeFi Investors: RWAs introduce a new asset class to the DeFi ecosystem, offering diversification opportunities for investors who have primarily been exposed to crypto-native assets. Stable and Predictable Yield: Money market funds, in particular, offer relatively stable and predictable yields compared to the often volatile yields in crypto markets. This can attract a more risk-averse institutional investor base. Real-World Utility for DeFi: By anchoring DeFi to real-world economic activity, RWAs enhance the legitimacy and long-term sustainability of the decentralized finance space. Horizon‚Äôs strategy of starting with tokenized MMFs is a smart move. It provides a low-risk entry point for institutions to explore Institutional DeFi , paving the way for the integration of more complex RWAs in the future. Institutional DeFi is Now More Accessible with Horizon ‚Äì What are the Concrete Benefits? For institutions eyeing the DeFi space, Horizon could be the green light they‚Äôve been waiting for. Institutional DeFi adoption has been hampered by regulatory uncertainties and concerns about risk management. Horizon directly addresses these challenges by offering a regulated and structured environment. Let‚Äôs break down the specific benefits for institutions: Benefit Description Regulatory Compliance Operating as a licensed instance of Aave V3 provides a regulated framework, offering institutions the compliance assurances they require. Familiar Asset Class Starting with tokenized money market funds allows institutions to utilize an asset class they are already comfortable with and understand deeply. Access to DeFi Yields Institutions can earn attractive yields on their MMF holdings by deploying them as collateral within Aave, potentially outperforming traditional money market returns. Efficient Capital Utilization Horizon enables institutions to put their idle cash reserves (held in MMFs) to work, generating returns in the DeFi ecosystem without significant operational overhead. Pathway to Broader DeFi Participation Horizon can serve as a stepping stone for institutions to gradually explore and engage with the wider DeFi landscape, beyond just RWAs and money market funds. By lowering the barriers to entry and providing a regulated and familiar on-ramp, Horizon positions Aave as a leader in attracting Institutional DeFi capital. What Challenges and Potential Risks Could Horizon Face? While Horizon presents a compelling vision, it‚Äôs crucial to acknowledge the potential challenges and risks associated with integrating Horizon into the Aave ecosystem. Navigating uncharted territory always comes with hurdles. Here are some key considerations: Regulatory Scrutiny: Operating in a regulated environment is both a benefit and a challenge. Increased regulatory scrutiny is inevitable, and Horizon will need to continuously adapt to evolving legal frameworks in different jurisdictions. Adoption Hurdles: Even with a regulated framework, convincing traditional institutions to embrace DeFi and RWAs will require significant education and outreach efforts. Overcoming ingrained skepticism and inertia within large organizations is a major task. Smart Contract Risks: While Aave is a battle-tested protocol, any new implementation, including Horizon, introduces potential smart contract vulnerabilities. Rigorous security audits and ongoing monitoring are essential. Custodial Risks: The security and custody of tokenized RWAs are paramount. Ensuring robust custodial solutions that meet institutional standards is critical for the success of Horizon. Scalability and Performance: As institutional adoption grows, Horizon will need to scale efficiently to handle increased transaction volumes and maintain optimal performance. Addressing these challenges proactively will be key to ensuring the long-term success and widespread adoption of Horizon . Aave DAO‚Äôs Strategic Role and the Future of Aave V3 & V4 with Horizon The Aave DAO (Decentralized Autonomous Organization) plays a pivotal role in the future of Horizon. As a community-governed protocol, the Aave DAO will ultimately decide whether to approve and implement the Horizon proposal. The proposed revenue share model, with 50% of first-year revenue and a potential 15% token allocation directed to the DAO treasury, highlights the significant value that Horizon is expected to bring back to the Aave ecosystem. Furthermore, Horizon‚Äôs planned transition from Aave V3 to Aave V4 is noteworthy. Aave V4 is anticipated to bring significant upgrades and features, and Horizon‚Äôs integration into this next-generation protocol underscores Aave Labs‚Äô commitment to continuous innovation and pushing the boundaries of DeFi. This strategic alignment with Aave V4 positions Horizon for long-term growth and scalability within the evolving DeFi landscape. Conclusion: Horizon ‚Äì A Bold Step Towards Mainstream DeFi Adoption Aave Labs‚Äô Horizon initiative is more than just a new product launch; it‚Äôs a bold and potentially transformative step towards bridging the gap between traditional finance and decentralized finance. By creating a regulated pathway for institutions to engage with DeFi through Real World Assets, Horizon has the potential to unlock unprecedented levels of liquidity and drive mainstream adoption of decentralized finance. While challenges remain, the vision and strategic approach behind Horizon are undeniably compelling. Keep a close watch on the Aave DAO governance process ‚Äì the future of institutional DeFi could very well be taking shape right now!

This decision follows a recent review of its listed assets to ensure compliance with its listing standards. The tokens, which were listed on Coinbase in late 2024, experienced significant price increases upon their announcement due to the 'Coinbase Effect,' but have since seen their values drop by about a quarter. Despite the trading halt announcement, the market response has been muted, with Floki gaining 3.6%, Giga rising 1.1%, and Turbo increasing by 5.4% in the last 24 hours. The Securities and Exchange Commission has clarified that meme coins typically do not qualify as securities under U.S. law, as they do not generate a yield or convey rights to future income, profits, or assets of a business. Legal experts speculate that the suspension may be linked to a pending legal case in New York. The move reflects Coinbase's ongoing efforts to monitor and adjust its platform in response to regulatory and market dynamics. The rise of meme coins, driven by platforms like the Solana-based Pump.fun launchpad, has been described as 'modern value creation' by Tracy Jin, COO of crypto exchange MEXC, who also warned of the high trading risks associated with these assets.

The entire crypto market is under intense selling pressure, driven by macroeconomic uncertainty and heightened volatility. However, meme coins like DOGE have been hit the hardest, as bears continue to short them aggressively, pushing prices lower with no signs of relief. Related Reading: Bitcoin Lost And Retested The 200-Day MA As Resistance ‚Äì Here‚Äôs What Happened Last Time Despite the heavy downturn, on-chain data suggests potential signs of recovery. Glassnode metrics reveal that Dogecoin network activity is surging, with a 47% increase in active addresses over the past month. Historically, increased network usage and transaction activity can indicate renewed interest and potential accumulation by long-term holders. If this trend continues, DOGE could see a rebound once market conditions start to improve. However, bulls still have a lot of work to do to regain lost ground and push Dogecoin back into a bullish trend. The coming days will be crucial, as traders closely watch whether network growth can translate into price stability or if further downside is ahead for DOGE and the broader meme coin sector. Dogecoin Down 70% As Network Activity Shows Grows Dogecoin¬†has suffered a brutal sell-off, now trading 70% below its December high as selling pressure remains relentless. Meme coins, in general, have been the most affected assets in the market, as fear and speculation drive investors away from high-risk assets. With DOGE failing to find strong support, bulls have a lot of work to do before any meaningful recovery can take place. Related Reading: New ONDO Addresses Surge 390% In 24 Hours ‚Äì A Sign Of Growing Interest In Ondo Finance The broader crypto market downturn has only added to the struggles. Bitcoin (BTC) has been in a downtrend since late January, and as fear continues to spread, investors are lowering their expectations and setting even lower targets. If this truly marks the end of BTC‚Äôs bull cycle, meme coins like Dogecoin will be among the hardest hit, as speculative assets tend to suffer the most in bearish conditions. However, not all signals are negative. Analyst Ali Martinez shared on-chain data on X, revealing that Dogecoin‚Äôs network activity is increasing. Active addresses have surged by 47% in the past month, rising from 110,000 to 163,000. Historically, rising network activity has often preceded a recovery in price, as it indicates renewed interest and engagement in the ecosystem. While DOGE still faces significant resistance, this spike in activity could be an early sign that buyers are returning. If Bitcoin stabilizes, the meme coin sector could see a relief bounce, potentially leading Dogecoin back toward key resistance levels. For now, DOGE remains under pressure, but its growing network activity provides a glimmer of hope for bullish traders watching for a turnaround. Dogecoin Struggles At $0.17 As Bears Maintain Control Dogecoin¬†is currently trading at $0.17 after enduring massive selling pressure and a dramatic shift in market sentiment toward fear. The broader crypto market downturn has hit meme coins the hardest, with DOGE struggling to find stability amid relentless sell-offs. For a potential recovery, DOGE must hold above the crucial $0.15 support level. If bulls manage to defend this zone, they could attempt a push toward the $0.20 mark, a key psychological resistance. Reclaiming $0.20 would signal a possible reversal, providing DOGE with the momentum needed to sustain a recovery rally. However, if selling pressure continues and DOGE loses the $0.15 level, the situation could become even more bearish. A break below this support could trigger a further decline toward $0.10, a level that hasn‚Äôt been tested since early 2023. Related Reading: XRP Flirts With A Daily Range Breakdown ‚Äì Price Must Hold Above $2 Level With market sentiment still fragile, traders are closely watching whether DOGE can hold its current range or if more downside is ahead.

The committee advanced the legislation by a vote of 18-6, marking the first major milestone in an effort that now awaits approval by the full Senate and a parallel version in the House of Representatives. The proposed legislation aims to regulate U.S. stablecoin issuers at the federal level, but its path to becoming law remains unclear. The bill must receive approval from both houses of Congress before reaching President Donald Trump‚Äôs desk for final approval. Additionally, lawmakers would need to reconcile differences between the Senate and House versions, a process that could present further challenges. The bill‚Äôs advancement was not without controversy. Democratic committee members acknowledged the need for stablecoin regulation but sought to introduce amendments to increase regulatory oversight. Each proposed amendment was ultimately rejected by party lines.

The protocol founder, Stani Kulechov, announced this on X, noting that this initiative will take decentralized finance to the next level. According to him, solutions that integrate real-world assets (RWA) into DeFi are needed to bring institutions on-chain. Horizon plans to achieve this by incorporating the best of Aave technology stack to build products for institutions. The official post from Aave Labs also confirmed the initiative, noting that the first Horizon product will allow tokenized money market funds (MMFs) to serve as collateral for institutions when they want to borrow stablecoins such as USDC and GHO on-chain. The post reads: ‚ÄúBy aligning with institutional standards while preserving DeFi‚Äôs core efficiencies, Horizon unlocks a compliant, scalable, and accessible pathway for institutions and tokenization platforms to engage in decentralized finance.‚Äù Meanwhile, Kulechov explained that the inspiration behind Horizon is the growth of the RWA sector in recent years, with on-chain US treasuries alone accounting for around $4 billion in total value locked (TVL). Tokenized USD Treasury TVL (Source: Stani Kulechov on X) Despite this growth, Aave Labs noted that there are still several structural gaps because DeFi‚Äôs open architecture is not suitable for institutional needs. Thus, Horizon is about closing these gaps by building solutions specifically for institutions. The firm is now calling on institutions such as liquidity providers and RWA issuers to collaborate. Unsurprisingly, some users have asked why there is a need for a new protocol when Aave Arc already serves institutions. However, Kulechov explained that Horizon offers permissionless liquidity with permissioned collateral, while Arc offers permissioned liquidity and collateral. He added that Horizon builds on lessons from Arc. Aave Labs proposes licensing Aave Instance for Horizon Following the announcement, Aave Labs has submitted a proposal to the Aave DAO to license an Aave instance for the new platform. Kulechov explained that this licensed instance will be the foundation for all projects under the Horizon initiative. According to the proposal, the Horizon RWA product will launch using an instance of Aave V3 before transitioning to Aave V4 when the latest version is available. Key features of the proposed Horizon protocol include permissionless USDC and GHO stablecoins; eligible users can borrow stablecoins; integration of approved RWA ERC-20 tokens; RWA issuers having asset-level permission management; etc. In return for licensing an Aave instance, Horizon wants to share profits with Aave DAO. The profit-sharing arrangement will see Aave DAO get 50% in the first year with a reduction over the next three years until it gets to 10% from the fourth year onward. There is also a provision that if Horizon launches a token, Aave DAO will get 15% of the allocation. The proposal claims that Horizon will benefit the Aave ecosystem in several ways by boosting GHO stablecoin adoption, generating more revenue for the DAO, and making Aave the preferred DeFi platform for institutions. Community members express concerns about Horizon diluting AAVE value Meanwhile, positive reactions have trailed the announcement from Kulechov, with many praising the initiative. However, there are also concerns from Aave DAO community members about how the idea of creating a new token for Horizon could dilute AAVE token value. Several users within the community have said they will vote against the proposal because of the plan to introduce a token. One user, Gregrwalsh, said the idea of a new token and declining revenue-sharing percentage make the proposal questionable. He wrote: ‚ÄúNot a fan of the proposed token launch. Unclear to me why diluting the Aave token makes sense. If for some reason a new token is needed there should be a 1:1 relationship to Aave tokens and holders receive their allocation accordingly.‚Äù Several other users share this view with some even saying they had to create an account just to express their view. However, Kulechov had explained on X that Horizon will not dilute Aave value and is, in fact, the ‚Äúhighest revenue stream proposal from all licensed instances.‚Äù Nevertheless, the strong opposition to the Horizon proposal in its current state means it is unlikely to pass unless Aave Labs changes key details. Several members of the popular Aave service provider and delegator Aave Chan Initiative (ACI), including its founder Marc Zeller, have also opposed the idea. Zeller reiterated that the A CI will not support the TEMP CHECK and that AAVE is the only token in the ecosystem. Cryptopolitan Academy: Want to grow your money in 2025?

41611080,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=139925,1741902038,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Urgent Forex Alert: Decoding Euro‚Äôs Slight Dip as Dollar Firms Amid German Spending Debate & US PPI Data,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/euro-dollar-forex-rate-analysis/,"In the fast-paced world of cryptocurrency and digital assets, understanding the fluctuations of traditional currencies like the Euro and the US Dollar is crucial. Why? Because these movements in the Forex market can often foreshadow broader economic trends that ripple into the crypto sphere. Today, we‚Äôre diving deep into the slight dip of the Euro against a firmer Dollar, a situation fueled by German spending debates and the latest U.S. Producer Price Index (PPI) data. Let‚Äôs unpack what this means for you, whether you‚Äôre trading Bitcoin, Ethereum, or simply keeping an eye on global economic indicators. Why is the Euro Dollar Forex Rate in Focus? The Euro Dollar Forex Rate is one of the most actively traded currency pairs globally. It serves as a barometer for the health of both the Eurozone and the U.S. economies. Any significant movement in this pair can indicate shifts in investor sentiment, trade balances, and monetary policy expectations. For crypto enthusiasts, monitoring the Euro Dollar Forex Rate provides insights into broader market risk appetite and potential capital flows. Here‚Äôs why this currency pair is particularly important right now: Economic Barometer: Reflects the comparative strength of two major economic blocs. Market Sentiment: Influences global investment decisions across asset classes, including crypto. Geopolitical Impact: Sensitive to political and economic developments in Europe and the United States. The German Spending Debate: A Drag on the Euro? Germany, the Eurozone‚Äôs economic powerhouse, is currently embroiled in a German Spending Debate . Recent discussions around government spending and fiscal policy are casting a shadow over the Euro. Concerns are mounting regarding the sustainability of current spending levels and the potential impact on Germany‚Äôs future economic growth. This internal debate is injecting uncertainty into the Euro, making it vulnerable to dips against other currencies, especially the Dollar. What‚Äôs causing this debate? Inflationary Pressures: Persistent inflation is forcing policymakers to reconsider spending priorities. Economic Slowdown: Fears of a potential recession in Germany are prompting discussions on fiscal prudence. Political Dynamics: Differing opinions within the German coalition government are adding complexity to the spending debate. This German Spending Debate is not just a local issue; it has broader implications for the Eurozone economy. A weakened German economy can weigh down the entire region, further impacting the Euro Dollar Forex Rate . U.S. PPI Data: Strengthening the Dollar‚Äôs Position? On the other side of the Atlantic, the latest US PPI Data has emerged as a key factor bolstering the Dollar. The Producer Price Index, which measures inflation from the perspective of producers, provides insights into potential future consumer price inflation. Stronger-than-expected PPI data often suggests that inflation might be more persistent, potentially leading the Federal Reserve to maintain or even increase interest rates. This anticipation of higher interest rates typically makes the Dollar more attractive to investors, thus contributing to Dollar Strength . Let‚Äôs break down the significance of US PPI Data : Indicator What it Measures Impact on Dollar Producer Price Index (PPI) Inflation at the wholesale level Strong PPI data can strengthen the Dollar Consumer Price Index (CPI) Inflation at the consumer level Also influences Dollar strength, often correlated with PPI Interest Rate Expectations Market anticipation of Fed rate hikes Higher expectations generally boost Dollar demand The recent US PPI Data release has painted a picture of continued inflationary pressure, which in turn has reinforced expectations of a hawkish stance from the Federal Reserve. This expectation is a significant driver behind the current Dollar Strength . Euro Weakness vs. Dollar Strength: A Forex Balancing Act The combination of the German Spending Debate and positive US PPI Data has created a scenario where we‚Äôre seeing Euro Weakness against a backdrop of Dollar Strength . This isn‚Äôt just a minor fluctuation; it reflects fundamental economic and policy divergences between the Eurozone and the United States. Here‚Äôs a comparative look at the factors influencing these currencies: Currency Factors Contributing to Current Trend Potential Future Outlook Euro German Spending Debate causing uncertainty Concerns about Eurozone economic growth Relatively dovish European Central Bank (ECB) policy Dependent on resolution of German fiscal issues ECB policy adjustments Broader Eurozone economic recovery US Dollar Strong US PPI Data Expectations of continued Fed hawkishness Resilient US economy (relative to Eurozone) Future inflation data Federal Reserve policy decisions Global risk sentiment The interplay between Euro Weakness and Dollar Strength is dynamic and constantly evolving. Traders and investors are closely monitoring these factors to anticipate future movements in the Euro Dollar Forex Rate . Actionable Insights for Crypto and Forex Traders So, what does all of this mean for you? Stay Informed: Keep a close watch on economic data releases, particularly PPI and CPI from the US, and economic news from Germany and the Eurozone. Monitor Forex Charts: Track the Euro Dollar Forex Rate charts for potential trading opportunities. Increased volatility can present both risks and rewards. Diversification: Consider diversifying your portfolio across different asset classes to mitigate risks associated with currency fluctuations. Risk Management: Always employ robust risk management strategies when trading in volatile markets. Understanding the macroeconomic factors influencing the Euro Dollar Forex Rate is not just for Forex traders. It‚Äôs equally important for anyone involved in the cryptocurrency market. Currency movements can impact the value of your crypto holdings and influence broader market sentiment. In Conclusion: Navigating Forex Tides The slight dip in the Euro against the firmer Dollar, driven by the German Spending Debate and supportive US PPI Data , underscores the complex interplay of economic and political factors in the Forex market. For those in the crypto space, these developments serve as a reminder of the interconnectedness of global finance. By staying informed and understanding these dynamics, you can better navigate the ever-changing tides of both the traditional and digital financial worlds.

On March 17, CME is preparing to launch SOL futures contracts . They will be among the first regulated Solana futures to hit the US market after Coinbase‚Äôs launched in February . The listing ‚Äúpaves the way for the eventual approval of SOL ETFs,‚Äù Chung told Cointelegraph. Chung said he expects the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to approve asset managers VanEck and Canary Capital‚Äôs proposed spot Solana ETFs as soon as May. The existence of regulated Solana futures ‚Äúsignals to regulators that Solana is maturing as an asset, making it easier for them to greenlight additional financial products of similar risk and type,‚Äù Chung said. Futures contracts are standardized agreements to buy or sell an underlying asset at a future date. They play a crucial supporting role for spot cryptocurrency ETFs because regulated futures markets provide a stable benchmark for measuring a digital asset‚Äôs performance.

These products ‚Äúwill bring more serious, sticky capital and pave the way for the development of other real-world use cases, such as payments and remittances,‚Äù according to Chung. Those use cases are ‚Äú[f]ar more boring than memecoins, perhaps, but a reliable source of long-term revenue that will buoy Solana‚Äôs price in the next bear market.‚Äù Memecoin trading, largely tied to the popular Pump.fun platform, comprises roughly 80% of the Solana blockchain network‚Äôs revenues, according to asset manager VanEck. However, activity on the Solana network declined in February after a series of memecoin-related scandals soured sentiment among retail traders. Solana vs. Ethereum price chart. Source: TradingView Rivaling Ethereum Still, cryptocurrency trading volumes on Solana continue to rival those of the entire Ethereum ecosystem, including its layer-2 scaling chains, VanEck said on March 6. Chung said he expects Solana ETFs to take off among retail investors, partly because of the challenges facing rival smart contract platform Ethereum. Solana‚Äôs native SOL token has performed about twice as well as Ether since early 2024, according to TradingView. Ethereum‚Äôs spot price has struggled since March 2024, when the network‚Äôs Dencun upgrade cut transaction fees by approximately 95%. ‚ÄúWith the extremely weak price action we‚Äôre seeing in ETH, Solana is now the only option for retail investors wanting to get exposure to crypto beyond Bitcoin, but not willing to go full degen,‚Äù Chung said.

He further denied claims that he wanted a presidential pardon from Trump, which could potentially allow him to assume an operational or management role at Binance. ‚ÄúNo felon would mind a pardon, especially being the only one in US history who was ever sentenced to prison for a single BSA [Bank Secrecy Act] charge,‚Äù said CZ. ‚ÄúFeels like the article is motivated as an attack on the President and crypto, and the residual forces of the ‚Äòwar on crypto‚Äô from the last administration are still at work.‚Äù CZ‚Äôs statement on a March 13 Wall Street Journal report.

41611425,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=139924,1741902613,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,CZ‚Äôs Fiery Rejection: Binance Founder Denounces ‚ÄòCrypto Attack‚Äô Claims Amidst Presidential Pardon Rumors,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/cz-fiery-rejection-crypto-attack/,"The crypto sphere is once again ablaze with speculation and controversy, this time ignited by a Wall Street Journal (WSJ) report alleging that Changpeng Zhao (CZ), the former CEO and founder of Binance, sought a presidential pardon. However, CZ has swiftly and strongly refuted these claims, dismissing the report as baseless and framing it as a calculated attack not only on himself but also on former U.S. President Donald Trump and the broader cryptocurrency industry. Let‚Äôs dive into the details of this developing story and unpack what it means for CZ, Binance, and the future of crypto. CZ‚Äôs Firm Denial of Presidential Pardon Request In a forceful response posted on X (formerly Twitter), CZ unequivocally denied the WSJ‚Äôs assertions. He stated in no uncertain terms that he has ‚Äúnever requested a presidential pardon‚Äù and clarified that he has not engaged in any discussions regarding a Binance.US deal, as suggested by the report. This direct and public rebuttal underscores the seriousness with which CZ is treating these allegations. His words carry significant weight within the crypto community, and his prompt reaction aims to set the record straight and control the narrative surrounding this potentially damaging report. Here‚Äôs a breakdown of CZ‚Äôs key points in his denial: Categorical Denial: CZ explicitly stated he never asked for a presidential pardon. No Binance.US Deal Talks: He refuted any claims of discussions related to a deal involving Binance.US. Attack Allegation: CZ suggested the WSJ article is part of a larger, politically motivated attack targeting both Donald Trump and the cryptocurrency sector. Call for Transparency: While not explicitly stated, his public denial implies a desire for factual reporting and transparency in media coverage concerning crypto. CZ‚Äôs assertive tone signals a proactive defense strategy. He is not merely dismissing the report; he is actively framing it as a deliberate attempt to harm his reputation, Binance, and the wider crypto ecosystem. This approach resonates with many in the crypto community who often perceive traditional media outlets as biased or misinformed about digital assets. Unpacking the ‚ÄòCrypto Attack‚Äô Allegations CZ‚Äôs claim that the WSJ report is part of a broader ‚Äò crypto attack ‚Äò is particularly noteworthy. This assertion taps into a prevalent sentiment within the cryptocurrency community that there are established forces actively working against the growth and adoption of digital currencies. But what exactly could CZ mean by a ‚Äò crypto attack ‚Äò? It could encompass several possibilities: Regulatory Scrutiny: Increased regulatory pressure and enforcement actions against crypto exchanges and projects could be perceived as an attack on the industry‚Äôs freedom and innovation. Negative Media Narratives: Consistent negative reporting and sensationalized stories in mainstream media can damage public perception and hinder adoption. CZ might be viewing the WSJ report as another instance of such negative media coverage. Political Maneuvering: In the politically charged environment of the U.S., especially with upcoming elections, crypto could become a pawn in larger political games. CZ suggesting an attack on Trump in conjunction with crypto implies a potential political dimension to the WSJ report. Market Manipulation: While less directly related to the WSJ report, market manipulation and coordinated efforts to destabilize crypto prices could also be considered forms of attack on the crypto market‚Äôs integrity. By framing the WSJ report as a ‚Äò crypto attack ‚Äò, CZ is appealing to a sense of shared adversity within the crypto community. This rhetoric can galvanize support and strengthen his position in the eyes of crypto enthusiasts who are already wary of mainstream media and regulatory overreach. The WSJ Report and the Presidential Pardon Context The core of the controversy stems from the WSJ‚Äôs report suggesting that CZ had sought a presidential pardon . Presidential pardons are a unique power granted to the President of the United States, allowing them to forgive federal crimes. The report‚Äôs implication is that CZ, facing legal challenges and scrutiny, was attempting to leverage this mechanism for relief. However, CZ‚Äôs vehement denial directly contradicts this narrative. Why would the WSJ report such claims? Several possibilities exist: Possible Reasons for WSJ Report Description Source Misinformation The WSJ might have relied on sources with inaccurate or biased information. In investigative journalism, verifying sources is crucial, but errors can still occur. Misinterpretation of Events The WSJ‚Äôs sources might have misinterpreted certain actions or communications, leading to the conclusion that a pardon was sought when it was not. Agenda-Driven Reporting It‚Äôs possible, though less likely, that the report was intentionally crafted to fit a pre-determined narrative, potentially driven by an agenda against CZ, Binance, or crypto in general, as CZ himself suggests. Genuine Belief (but Incorrect) The WSJ reporters might genuinely believe their sources and the information they received, even if it ultimately proves to be incorrect. Regardless of the WSJ‚Äôs motivations or the accuracy of their report, CZ‚Äôs swift and decisive denial has thrown the narrative into question. The burden of proof now arguably shifts to the WSJ to substantiate their claims or risk losing credibility within the crypto community and beyond. Binance and CZ: Navigating Regulatory Waters Binance , under CZ‚Äôs leadership, grew into the world‚Äôs largest cryptocurrency exchange, a position it attained through rapid expansion and aggressive market strategies. However, this growth has also brought increased regulatory scrutiny. Binance has faced investigations and regulatory actions in various jurisdictions around the globe, including the United States. Navigating these complex regulatory waters has been a significant challenge for Binance and CZ. Key challenges Binance has faced include: Anti-Money Laundering (AML) Compliance: Ensuring robust AML and Know Your Customer (KYC) procedures to prevent illicit activities on the platform. Securities Regulations: Determining which cryptocurrencies are classified as securities and complying with relevant securities laws in different countries. Licensing and Registration: Obtaining necessary licenses and registrations to operate legally in various jurisdictions. Decentralization vs. Regulation: Balancing the decentralized ethos of crypto with the need for regulatory compliance, which often favors centralized control and oversight. CZ‚Äôs departure as CEO of Binance was part of a settlement with U.S. regulators, signaling a significant shift in the exchange‚Äôs operational structure and leadership. Despite stepping down as CEO, CZ remains a highly influential figure in the crypto world, and his actions and statements continue to be closely watched. Trump and Crypto: A Political Dimension? CZ‚Äôs suggestion that the WSJ report is also an attack on Donald Trump adds another layer of complexity to the situation. Donald Trump ‚Äòs stance on cryptocurrency has been somewhat evolving. While initially skeptical, there have been indications of a more open approach to digital assets in recent times, particularly within certain segments of the Republican party. The connection between Trump and crypto is multifaceted: Political Polarization: Crypto has, to some extent, become a politically polarized issue, with different viewpoints emerging across the political spectrum. Regulatory Approaches: Different political administrations may adopt varying regulatory approaches to crypto, impacting the industry‚Äôs growth and development. Public Sentiment: Public opinion on crypto can be influenced by political narratives and endorsements from prominent figures like Donald Trump . Election Implications: With upcoming elections, crypto could become a topic of debate and policy discussion, potentially influencing voter preferences, especially among younger demographics and tech-savvy individuals. By linking the WSJ report to an attack on Trump , CZ might be attempting to politicize the issue and garner support from Trump ‚Äòs political base, which often expresses skepticism towards mainstream media narratives and regulatory overreach. This strategy could be aimed at broadening the support base for CZ and Binance beyond just the crypto community. Actionable Insights and Future Implications This unfolding situation offers several actionable insights for crypto enthusiasts, investors, and industry participants: Critical Media Consumption: Always approach news reports, especially in the fast-paced crypto world, with a critical eye. Verify information from multiple sources and be wary of sensationalized headlines. Focus on Facts: Prioritize factual reporting and verified information over rumors and speculation. CZ‚Äôs direct denial is a crucial piece of factual information in this case. Understand Regulatory Landscape: Stay informed about the evolving regulatory landscape for cryptocurrencies. Regulatory actions and interpretations can significantly impact the market and individual projects. Community Engagement: Engage in constructive discussions within the crypto community. Share verified information and help to debunk misinformation. Long-Term Perspective: Maintain a long-term perspective on crypto. Short-term news cycles and controversies are part of the journey. Focus on the underlying technology and its potential. Conclusion: Navigating the Crypto Narrative The CZ-WSJ report saga is a stark reminder of the intense scrutiny and often turbulent narratives surrounding the cryptocurrency world. CZ‚Äôs forceful denial and his framing of the report as a ‚Äò crypto attack ‚Äò underscore the ongoing battles for narrative control within the industry. Whether the WSJ report was based on misinformation, misinterpretation, or had ulterior motives remains to be fully clarified. However, CZ‚Äôs proactive response highlights the importance of swift and decisive communication in the age of instant information and social media. As the crypto industry matures, navigating these narrative challenges and ensuring accurate and balanced reporting will be crucial for fostering wider adoption and building trust.

Spot traders made a $53 million investment which indicates escalating positive sentiment. Past market patterns show PEPE may rebound by more than 300% when it breaks out from its current support level which corresponds to the 2024 price structure. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) propels forward while its presale continues by raising $3.1 million from 5,300 holders. Phase 3 is open with tokens purchased for $0.02. The structured growth model of MUTM provides a path to 2025 success while PEPE experiences volatility at present. PEPE‚Äôs Unstable Position PEPE lost 26% of its value after breaking through its annual support threshold which had driven a 348% surge during previous rallies. The reluctance of derivatives traders becomes evident through their funding rates which reached -0.0297 for the first time in history. The $53 million spot investment during the last week marked a peak since January but PEPE requires a reversal of ongoing negative market trends to bounce back. Several experts draw parallels between the current market situation to April 2024 which resulted in a 338% price increase after a stop-hunt event occurred. PEPE shows signs of falling again because RSI bounces repeatedly without lasting buyer support. The price point of $0.00000399 could trigger further financial losses for individuals who hold PEPE in the long term. Mutuum Finance Gains Momentum Mutuum Finance (MUTM) contrasts sharply with PEPE‚Äôs turbulence. The Phase 3 presale price for MUTM stands at $0.02 while the following phase will reach $0.025 according to protocol specifications. The first participants who entered the presale have received 400% returns before the planned $0.06 exchange listing while the major investment opportunities shall become available after the launch. Analysts predict MUTM will increase to $2.50 within months after its initial exchange listing which will yield 12,400% ROI from its current value. The growth potential of Mutuum Finance exists primarily in its lending environment because mtTokens gain value by collecting interest payments while drawing consistent purchasing demand from revenue-sharing token distribution mechanisms. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) relies on real DeFi functionality through its platform features instead of depending on speculative market behavior like PEPE. TM attracts borrowers because they can obtain liquidity through its peer-to-peer lending platform that supports overcollateralized loans. Lenders who participate earn fluctuating payment yields which stimulates perpetual market demand for MUTM. The swift pace at which Phase 3 of the presale sells its tokens indicates accelerating Fear of Missing Out since investors seek stable and recurring growth. The price increase scheduled in Phase 4 of the marketing campaign is rapidly reducing the opportunity to acquire tokens at their current $0.025 value. Positioning for 2025 Growth The unpredictable price swings of PEPE demonstrate the dangers involved in investing in meme-based cryptocurrencies when the crypto market starts to cool. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) integrates DeFi innovation into its tokenomics model to create an insurance against unpredictable market events. Through its presale mechanics the project provides double gains to launch-day backers and anticipates substantial price appreciation over 100 times its initial price mark as user adoption increases over time. The buy-and-distribute model of MUTM generates potential value according to analysts because it uses platform fees for token buybacks that increase tokenize supply. The uncertain rebound predictions of PEPE traders are counterbalanced by Mutuum Finance (MUTM) whose defined return amplification plan. Phase 3‚Äôs initial offering entry at $0.02 has started disappearing because market observers observe its daily depletion. Investors looking at breakout performers for 2025 should combine PEPE‚Äôs speculative investments with MUTM‚Äôs steady approach to achieve extraordinary portfolio expansion.

41611869,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=139926,1741903235,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Revolutionary Move: BNY Mellon Supercharges USDC Services with Circle Partnership,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/bny-mellon-expands-usdc/,"In a revolutionary stride towards bridging traditional finance and the burgeoning world of digital assets, Bank of New York (BNY) Mellon, America‚Äôs oldest bank, is deepening its foray into the cryptocurrency sphere. The financial behemoth is expanding its collaboration with Circle, the issuer of the USD Coin (USDC) stablecoin. This strategic move, initially reported by Odaily and highlighted by The Information, empowers BNY Mellon‚Äôs institutional clients to directly send and receive funds for USDC transactions, marking a significant upgrade from Circle‚Äôs previous reliance on smaller U.S. banks for such operations. Unpacking the BNY Mellon and Circle Partnership: A New Era for USDC For those deeply entrenched in the crypto world, the name BNY Mellon might seem like an unexpected entrant. However, this isn‚Äôt BNY Mellon‚Äôs first dance with digital assets. The bank has been steadily warming up to crypto, and this expansion of USDC services is a testament to their growing commitment. Let‚Äôs break down what this partnership entails and why it‚Äôs creating ripples across the financial landscape: Direct Transaction Capabilities: Previously, Circle‚Äôs enterprise customers depended on smaller, less globally recognized U.S. banks to facilitate the movement of funds for USDC transactions. This setup, while functional, may have posed limitations on scalability and trust, particularly for larger institutional players. BNY Mellon‚Äôs involvement changes the game. Its robust infrastructure and global presence provide a significantly more substantial and reliable channel for USDC transactions. Enhanced Efficiency and Scalability: Partnering with a banking giant like BNY Mellon streamlines the process of sending and receiving funds for USDC. This enhanced efficiency is crucial for institutional clients who deal with large volumes of transactions. The scalability offered by BNY Mellon‚Äôs infrastructure can accommodate the growing demand for USDC and stablecoin transactions, potentially unlocking new avenues for growth. Boosted Institutional Confidence: BNY Mellon‚Äôs name carries immense weight in the traditional finance world. Its endorsement and active participation in the USDC ecosystem lend a significant layer of credibility and trust to stablecoin transactions. This increased confidence is paramount for attracting more institutional investors to the crypto space, as it mitigates concerns related to counterparty risk and regulatory compliance. Why USDC and Why Now? The Rise of Stablecoins To truly appreciate the significance of this partnership, it‚Äôs essential to understand the role of stablecoins like USDC in the crypto ecosystem and beyond. Stablecoins are cryptocurrencies designed to maintain a stable value, typically pegged to a fiat currency like the US dollar. They offer the best of both worlds ‚Äì the stability of traditional currencies and the efficiency and accessibility of blockchain technology. Here‚Äôs why USDC is gaining traction and why BNY Mellon‚Äôs expanded services are timely: Bridging Fiat and Crypto: USDC acts as a crucial bridge between the traditional fiat currency system and the often-volatile cryptocurrency markets. It allows users to move value between these worlds with relative ease and stability. Facilitating DeFi and Crypto Transactions: In the decentralized finance (DeFi) space, USDC is a cornerstone for trading, lending, and borrowing. Its stability minimizes the risk of impermanent loss and makes DeFi protocols more accessible to a wider audience. Similarly, in broader crypto transactions, USDC provides a stable medium of exchange, reducing exposure to price fluctuations. Growing Regulatory Clarity: As regulatory frameworks around cryptocurrencies mature, stablecoins are increasingly viewed as a more regulated and compliant entry point into digital assets. This growing clarity is encouraging traditional financial institutions like BNY Mellon to engage more deeply with stablecoin technologies. Demand from Institutional Investors: Institutional investors are increasingly seeking exposure to digital assets, but often require regulated and stable instruments. USDC, backed by fully reserved assets and issued by a regulated entity like Circle, fits this bill perfectly. BNY Mellon: A Traditional Giant Embracing Crypto Banking BNY Mellon‚Äôs deepening engagement with crypto banking is not happening in isolation. It reflects a broader trend of traditional financial institutions recognizing the transformative potential of blockchain technology and digital assets. Let‚Äôs explore why BNY Mellon‚Äôs move is particularly noteworthy: Aspect Significance of BNY Mellon‚Äôs Involvement Historical Significance As America‚Äôs oldest bank, BNY Mellon‚Äôs entry into expanded USDC services sends a powerful signal to the market about the legitimacy and future of digital assets. Infrastructure and Expertise BNY Mellon brings decades of experience in custody, asset servicing, and global payments. This infrastructure is crucial for scaling crypto services and ensuring operational efficiency and security. Regulatory Compliance BNY Mellon operates within a highly regulated framework. Its involvement in USDC services suggests a commitment to compliance and can help shape responsible innovation in the crypto space. Catalyst for Adoption BNY Mellon‚Äôs actions can pave the way for other traditional banks to follow suit, accelerating the mainstream adoption of crypto and stablecoins. Circle‚Äôs Strategic Win: Expanding Reach and Reliability For Circle, the partnership with BNY Mellon is a strategic victory. While Circle has established itself as a leading issuer of Circle , collaborating with a bank of BNY Mellon‚Äôs stature significantly elevates its position and capabilities. Here‚Äôs how this partnership benefits Circle and the broader USDC ecosystem: Reduced Reliance on Smaller Banks: As highlighted in the initial report, Circle‚Äôs previous reliance on smaller U.S. banks for fund transfers may have limited its growth potential. BNY Mellon‚Äôs involvement mitigates this limitation, providing a more robust and scalable banking partner. Enhanced Credibility and Trust: Partnering with BNY Mellon enhances Circle‚Äôs credibility and trust, particularly among institutional clients who prioritize security and reliability. This can attract more enterprise clients to adopt USDC for their business operations. Global Expansion Opportunities: BNY Mellon‚Äôs global network can facilitate Circle‚Äôs expansion into new markets. This partnership can open doors to international institutional clients and accelerate the global adoption of USDC. Focus on Core Competencies: By outsourcing fund transfer infrastructure to BNY Mellon, Circle can focus more on its core competencies ‚Äì issuing and managing USDC, developing innovative stablecoin applications, and fostering the growth of the USDC ecosystem. The Future of Crypto Banking and Stablecoin Adoption: What to Expect? BNY Mellon‚Äôs expanded crypto banking services for USDC are not just an incremental step; they represent a significant leap forward in the integration of traditional finance and digital assets. As we look ahead, here are some key takeaways and potential future developments: Accelerated Institutional Adoption: This partnership is likely to accelerate the adoption of USDC and other stablecoins by institutional investors. The enhanced infrastructure, credibility, and regulatory comfort provided by BNY Mellon can overcome many of the barriers that have previously hindered institutional crypto adoption. Innovation in Financial Services: The collaboration between BNY Mellon and Circle can spur further innovation in financial services. We may see the development of new products and services that leverage the strengths of both traditional banking and blockchain technology, such as stablecoin-based payments, lending platforms, and investment vehicles. Increased Regulatory Scrutiny: As stablecoins become more mainstream and integrated into the traditional financial system, regulatory scrutiny is likely to intensify. This partnership may encourage regulators to develop clearer and more comprehensive frameworks for stablecoin regulation. Mainstream Crypto Integration: Ultimately, moves like BNY Mellon‚Äôs expansion of USDC services are contributing to the broader trend of mainstream crypto integration. As traditional financial institutions embrace digital assets, we can expect to see a more seamless and interconnected financial ecosystem emerge. Conclusion: A Groundbreaking Partnership Shaping the Future of Finance The expansion of BNY Mellon‚Äôs USDC services through its partnership with Circle is a groundbreaking development. It signifies a major step towards mainstream adoption of stablecoins and the deeper integration of cryptocurrency into traditional finance. By providing institutional clients with a more robust, reliable, and scalable infrastructure for USDC transactions, BNY Mellon is not just enhancing its service offerings; it is actively shaping the future of finance. This move is a clear indicator that the lines between traditional and digital finance are blurring, paving the way for a more inclusive, efficient, and innovative financial ecosystem. The implications of this partnership are far-reaching, promising to unlock new opportunities for growth and innovation in both the crypto and traditional financial worlds.

In new posts on the social media platform X, Coinbase is announcing the additions of the decentralized finance (DeFi) platform Maple Syrup ( SYRUP ) and artificial intelligence (AI)-based token Aethir ( ATH ) to its suite of digital asset products. Coinbase‚Äôs announcements preceded rallies for both tokens. The additions of SYRUP and ATH come a few days after Coinbase added the tokens to its listing roadmap last week, signaling upcoming support. At the time, both assets jumped nearly 40% in price. News of the support caused both the assets to spike in price, as SYRUP went from a low of $0.131 on March 12th to a peak of $0.173 just a day later, a gain of 28.7% during the last 24 hours, while ATH went from a low of $0.034 to a peak of $0.040 during the same time frame, a gain of 14.4% on the day. Aethir is a decentralized cloud computing protocol that launched last year focused on providing high-performance graphics processing unit (GPU) capabilities to AI as well as blockchain-based video games. Maple Syrup, a DeFi protocol that launched in 2021, brings together borrowers and lenders and allows borrowers to utilize under-collateralized loans as a means of accessing capital and lets lenders earn rewards by providing funds.

The decentralized exchange (DEX) arena is buzzing with news as Hyperliquid DEX just dropped a bombshell. Not only has this platform smashed through the $1 trillion trading volume barrier ‚Äì a feat that truly sets it apart and puts it in the same league as centralized giants ‚Äì but they‚Äôre also proactively tightening their risk management game. If you‚Äôre trading on Hyperliquid or keeping a close eye on the evolving DEX landscape, you need to pay attention to this: starting March 15th, a new 20% margin ratio requirement for margin transfers will be in effect. Let‚Äôs dive into what this means for you and the broader crypto ecosystem. Hyperliquid DEX Achieves Unprecedented Crypto Trading Volume Let‚Äôs start with the headline-grabbing achievement: Hyperliquid DEX has officially crossed the $1 trillion mark in crypto trading volume . This isn‚Äôt just another number; it‚Äôs a monumental milestone. For a DEX to reach this scale is unprecedented, signaling a significant shift in the crypto trading landscape. Traditionally, centralized exchanges (CEXs) have dominated when it comes to trading volume, offering features and infrastructure that DEXs were, for a long time, struggling to match. Hyperliquid‚Äôs accomplishment throws down the gauntlet, proving that decentralized platforms can indeed rival and potentially surpass their centralized counterparts in terms of sheer trading activity. Consider these points to understand the magnitude of this achievement: Challenging CEX Dominance: For years, CEXs like Binance and Coinbase have been the go-to platforms for high-volume crypto trading. Hyperliquid‚Äôs $1 trillion volume demonstrates that DEXs are no longer playing in the minor leagues. They are becoming serious contenders for market share. Decentralization at Scale: One of the core tenets of crypto is decentralization. Hyperliquid‚Äôs success shows that decentralization can scale to meet the demands of high-frequency, high-volume trading, without sacrificing performance or security. Growing DEX Adoption: This milestone is a strong indicator of the increasing adoption of DEXs. Traders are becoming more comfortable with decentralized platforms, attracted by their transparency, self-custody of funds, and often lower fees. This surge in crypto trading volume on Hyperliquid isn‚Äôt just luck; it‚Äôs a testament to the platform‚Äôs technology, user experience, and the growing appetite for decentralized trading solutions. But with great volume comes great responsibility, and that leads us to the next crucial update. Understanding the Decentralized Exchange Margin Requirements Update In response to this explosive growth and, crucially, to bolster platform stability and trader safety, Hyperliquid is implementing a crucial update: a margin requirements update . Starting March 15th at 00:00 UTC, a 20% margin ratio requirement will be enforced on all margin transfers. But what exactly does this mean, and why is it important? Let‚Äôs break down the concept of decentralized exchange margin requirements: What is Margin? In trading, margin is essentially collateral. When you trade with leverage (borrowed funds), you need to provide margin to cover potential losses. It‚Äôs a safety net for the exchange and, in a way, for the trader as well. Margin Ratio Requirement: A margin ratio requirement dictates the minimum amount of margin you must maintain relative to the size of your position. A 20% margin ratio means that for every $100 position you hold, you must have at least $20 as margin. Why Increase Margin Requirements? As trading volume and the size of positions on Hyperliquid grow, so does the potential for systemic risk. Large positions, especially in volatile markets, can pose risks to the platform‚Äôs stability and the broader ecosystem. Increasing margin requirements is a proactive measure to mitigate these risks. Impact on Margin Transfers: This specific update targets margin transfers. This likely refers to the process of moving margin funds within the platform, perhaps when adjusting positions or transferring funds between accounts. The 20% requirement will apply to these transfers, ensuring sufficient collateral is maintained. This isn‚Äôt about hindering trading activity; it‚Äôs about creating a more robust and secure trading environment as Hyperliquid scales. Think of it like increasing the safety standards on a highway as traffic volume increases ‚Äì it‚Äôs necessary for everyone‚Äôs well-being. The Benefits of Enhanced DEX Risk Management Why should traders care about increased DEX risk management measures like this margin update? While it might seem like a restriction at first glance, stronger margin requirements actually bring several key benefits: Benefit Description Platform Stability Higher margin requirements reduce the likelihood of cascading liquidations and systemic risk events. This makes the platform more resilient to market shocks and large price swings. Trader Protection While it might limit leverage slightly, it also protects traders from over-leveraging and potentially facing catastrophic losses. It encourages more responsible trading practices. Reduced Systemic Risk By mitigating the risks associated with large positions, Hyperliquid contributes to a healthier and more stable overall crypto market. This is beneficial for the entire ecosystem. Long-Term Sustainability Proactive risk management is crucial for the long-term success and sustainability of any trading platform, especially in the volatile crypto space. It builds trust and confidence in the platform. In essence, robust DEX risk management isn‚Äôt just about protecting the platform; it‚Äôs about creating a safer and more sustainable environment for all participants. It‚Äôs a sign of maturity and responsible growth as Hyperliquid continues to lead the charge in decentralized trading. Navigating the Margin Requirements Update: Actionable Insights for Traders So, what do you, as a crypto trader, need to do in light of this margin requirements update ? Here are some actionable insights: Review Your Margin Positions: If you‚Äôre trading on Hyperliquid with margin, carefully review your current positions and ensure you understand the new 20% requirement. Calculate if your current margin levels are sufficient. Adjust Trading Strategies: You might need to adjust your trading strategies to accommodate the higher margin requirement. This could mean slightly reducing leverage or allocating more capital as margin. Plan for Margin Transfers: If you regularly transfer margin within Hyperliquid, be mindful of the new rule starting March 15th. Ensure you have adequate margin available when making transfers to avoid any disruptions. Risk Management Focus: This update serves as a timely reminder of the importance of robust risk management in crypto trading. Always trade responsibly, understand leverage, and never risk more than you can afford to lose. Stay Informed: Keep an eye on Hyperliquid‚Äôs official communication channels for any further updates or clarifications regarding the margin requirements. While changes in margin requirements can initially seem like a hurdle, they are often necessary steps towards building a more resilient and trustworthy trading ecosystem. For traders on Hyperliquid, this is a call to refine your risk management practices and adapt to a more secure trading environment. Conclusion: A Step Towards Mature DEX Trading Hyperliquid DEX reaching $1 trillion in trading volume is a landmark achievement for the decentralized finance (DeFi) space. It signifies the growing power and potential of DEXs to compete head-to-head with centralized exchanges. The proactive implementation of a 20% margin ratio requirement further underscores Hyperliquid‚Äôs commitment to responsible growth and risk mitigation. This isn‚Äôt just about setting records; it‚Äôs about building a sustainable and secure future for decentralized trading. As the crypto landscape continues to evolve, these kinds of proactive measures are crucial for fostering trust, stability, and long-term growth in the DeFi sector. Hyperliquid‚Äôs move is a positive signal, indicating a maturation of the DEX space and a focus on building robust and reliable platforms for the future of finance.
