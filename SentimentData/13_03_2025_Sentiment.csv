According to a post shared on X, the company has bought 188 Bitcoin for $17.1 million at an average of $91,000 per Bitcoin. This investment is part of Rumble‚Äôs new treasury strategy, with plans to allocate up to $20 million toward Bitcoin acquisitions. Rumble Strengthens Ties with the Crypto Community The Canada-based gaming and streaming company has built a reputation as a platform that supports decentralized technology. The company‚Äôs decision to add Bitcoin to its balance sheets shows its support for the crypto sector while diversifying its investments beyond traditional markets. Rumble‚Äôs CEO, Chris Pavlovski, explained that Bitcoin can help protect finance against inflation. He pointed out that, unlike regular money governments can print endlessly, Bitcoin has a fixed supply, making it a valuable alternative. The company also mentioned that it may buy more Bitcoin in the future, depending on market conditions, Bitcoin‚Äôs price, and its financial situation. The investment aligns with its broader push into cloud services and alternative media, where blockchain and digital assets are becoming increasingly relevant. Rumble‚Äôs latest Bitcoin comes after Senator Cynthia Lummis reintroduced the national Bitcoin reserves bill days after President Donald Trump signed an executive order to establish a digital asset stockpile. Rumble‚Äôs Stock Increases Amid Financial Implications After the announcement, Rumble‚Äôs stock (RUM) rose 2.7% in Nasdaq‚Äôs pre-market trading. However, some financial experts worry that Rumble bought Bitcoin when the price was too high. Right now, Bitcoin is trading at $82,664, which means Rumble‚Äôs investment is down by 10.33%, losing about $1.77 million in paper value. Despite this short-term, the company seems confident that Bitcoin will grow in value over time. A Growing Presence in Corporate Bitcoin Holdings With this purchase, Rumble is now the 40th largest company holding Bitcoin, according to the Bitcoin Treasuries tracker. Its Bitcoin now makes up 0.60% of its total market value, showing its strong interest in digital money. This move comes after Rumble received a $775 million investment from Tether , the company behind the USDT stablecoin, in December 2024. As Bitcoin and stablecoins become more important to its business, Rumble balances media, cloud technology, and crypto adoption.

This move allows the company to introduce regulated derivative products and services for institutional clients across the European Economic Area (EEA), pending Malta Financial Services Authority (MFSA) approval. The regulation news was made during an exclusive event on Manoel Island, Malta, as part of OKX‚Äôs strategy to strengthen its presence in the European market. OKX Acquires MiFID II License To Expand In Europe According to a recent announcement , OKX secured a MiFID II license through the acquisition of a Malta-based firm that holds the regulatory approval. The entity will become operational later this year after receiving clearance from the Malta Financial Services Authority (MFSA). The MiFID II license will allow OKX to introduce regulated derivatives and investment solutions for institutional clients across the EEA. This move will enhance institutional market access while maintaining compliance with European financial regulations. Previously, OKX received a full Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA) license, enabling the exchange to provide localized crypto trading services across 30 EU member states. The MiCA license supports various offerings, including spot trading, over-the-counter (OTC) trading, and automated trading solutions. Amid these regulation news, earlier this month, top crypto exchange Binance announced that it would be delisting all non-MiCA-compliant stablecoin trading pairs for users in the EEA. Institutional Offerings With Regulatory Compliance OKX‚Äôs expansion under MiFID II aims to align digital assets with traditional financial markets. The company intends to provide institutional-grade services that meet European compliance standards. The newly acquired license will help OKX partner with tier-one financial institutions and introduce new regulated investment products. With the MiFID II approval, OKX plans to integrate additional risk management features and trading solutions tailored for institutional investors. The exchange seeks to offer advanced derivatives products while ensuring security in line with European regulations. Additionally, OKX‚Äôs institutional clients will gain access to new derivatives trading services under the MiFID II license. The platform currently supports trading for over 240 cryptocurrency tokens, 300 trading pairs, and 60 euro-based trading pairs. Concurrently, the top crypto exchange plans to expand its fiat on-ramp options. The company allows users to deposit and withdraw euros at no cost through bank transfers while supporting card payments and other local payment methods. More so, the exchange‚Äôs website and mobile app are designed to support local languages, currency displays, and customer service tailored to each European market. The company is set to introduce more localized services, including streamlined Know Your Customer (KYC) processes. Reacting to the regulation news, Erald Ghoos, OKX Europe CEO added, ‚ÄúWith this license, we are set to deliver institutional-grade services, partner with tier 1 financial institutions, and offer regulated investment solutions that enhance market access and empower investors across the continent.‚Äù The post OKX Expands Institutional Offerings In Europe With MiFID II License appeared first on CoinGape .",24/7 Cryptocurrency News|Regulation News,EN,0,0,TRADING|EXCHANGE|MARKET|REGULATION|BUSINESS,"{'name': 'CoinGape', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coingape.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coingape,2025-03-12 22:34:13

With that move, OKX will be able to offer a wider selection of derivative products to traders from the Euro Area. OKX Europe will gain a MiFID II license for operating in the Euro Area, after acquiring a company already registered with Malta‚Äôs financial authorities. Acquisitions have been the main approach of exchange operators in becoming compliant with EU financial regulations. The Markets in Financial Instruments Directive regulation is one of the key documents setting up the requirements for crypto exchanges.

Learn more: https://t.co/xswBXeyCSF pic.twitter.com/Z7p7tcOuMe ‚Äî OKX (@okx) March 12, 2025 OKX announced the acquisition during an official event in Malta. OKX aims to expand during the current market cycle, by reaching traders of all levels. The exchange has already become the first market operator to become compliant with the Markets in Crypto-Asset (MiCA) Regulation, receiving a pre-authorization status. Currently, OKX is working toward becoming fully MiCA compliant. OKX aims to reach all 28 countries in the European Union, bringing OTC, spot trading, automated, and copy-trading for over 240 tokens in 300 trading pairs. OKX also offers fiat-based pairs against the Euro. The main effect of the MiFID license will be the introduction of advanced derivatives and futures markets. OKX will be able to serve institutional clients with sophisticated trading tools. The exchange is also working toward localization in multiple European languages. The customers of OKX will also be able to deposit and withdraw Euro at no cost through a Euro Area bank transfer. The exchange will offer crypto purchases using cards and other localized payment methods. As a MiFID platform, OKX will offer easier KYC verification, with access to more diverse payment gateways. OKX will continue to announce the new features as they become active. Exchanges target Euro Area for growth OKX is one of the leading exchanges based on trust score. The market operator carried volumes of $3.7B and lined up among the most active centralized markets. Most of the traffic for OKX comes from outside the Euro Area. Visitors from Brazil are the most active, followed by US traders making up 8.2% of site visits. OKX also services crypto-friendly regions and countries, including Vietnam, the Philippines, and Turkey. The recent acquisition aims to expand the services of OKX to a new and highly active crypto market. While smaller, the European market is well-regulated. During the latest bull cycle, investors from Germany, France, and the UK joined some of the latest trends, including memes and prediction markets on Polymarket. EU countries have a lower rank in terms of crypto adoption, lagging behind the USA, as revealed by Chainalysis data . Despite this, OKX aims to tap Europe as a growth market, with increasing crypto adoption. Up to 30.7M European traders have some contact with the crypto market, or non-zero holdings. Major exchanges aim to bring reliable services and a fully regulated market with compliant stablecoin pairings. OKX investigated for the laundering of the Bybit hack funds OKX has been scrutinized for its decentralized services, especially its Web3 wallet. During the Bybit hack, the decentralized service was used to launder a part of the funds, which OKX did not block or freeze. Decentralized services and wallets are still a gray area for regulators, but may be one of the new areas to include under the MiCA compliance requirements. The OKX Web3 wallet is borderless and permissionless, serving as an aggregator and access point to decentralized trading. The ability to scrutinize and freeze transactions remains limited. OKX has only partnered by freezing and blacklisting funds through its centralized exchange. OKX claims its decentralized service is not a part of the exchange‚Äôs main product package. Currently, the service is under investigation in the EU. While OKX Europe is allowed to offer basic services from its Malta headquarters, the investigation of its DEX and Web3 unit may lead to a loss of permission for some operations in the Euro Area.

After reaching a three-day high of $84,437, BTC/USD quickly reversed course as bearish pressure emerged. The U.S. Consumer Price Index (CPI) for January came in below expectations at 2.8%, signaling a slowdown in inflation. Core CPI, which excludes volatile food and energy prices, fell to 3.1%‚Äîalso lower than expected. ‚ÄúThis marks the first decline in both Headline and Core CPI since July 2024. Inflation is cooling down in the US,‚Äù noted The Kobeissi Letter, a trading analysis firm. Despite this seemingly positive data, Wall Street‚Äôs opening saw renewed selling pressure across the cryptocurrency market. Bitcoin fell to $82,400 before stabilizing around its daily opening price. Technical Indicators and Market Trends Popular crypto analyst Rekt Capital pointed out that Bitcoin has started to exit a previously filled CME Gap‚Äîan important price zone linked to Bitcoin futures trading on CME Group. ‚ÄúAny dips into the top of the CME Gap would constitute a post-breakout retest attempt to fully confirm the exit from this CME Gap. Initial signs of that retest occurring already,‚Äù he explained. Other analysts focused on key technical indicators such as the 200-day Simple and Exponential Moving Averages (SMA/EMA), which serve as crucial support levels in bull markets. ‚ÄúBulls got work to do here to get back above the Daily 200MA/EMA. Last year we had the same thing and price chopped around these levels for 3+ months,‚Äù noted trader Daan Crypto Trades. Currently, these levels sit at $83,550 and $85,650, respectively. Bitcoin ETF Outflows Indicate Institutional Caution On the macroeconomic front, trading firm QCP Capital suggested that the CPI data could influence the Federal Reserve‚Äôs upcoming decision on interest rates. ‚ÄúWith inflation concerns lingering and macro risks mounting, the CPI print will be a key determinant of whether the disinflationary trend will hold, or volatility intensifies in the near term,‚Äù QCP stated in its latest market update. Institutional investors are also showing signs of caution. Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) experienced a significant net outflow of $153.87 million, largely driven by Grayscale‚Äôs Bitcoin Trust (GBTC). GBTC offloaded 641 BTC worth $56.45 million, bringing its total holdings down to 195,746 BTC, valued at approximately $17.24 billion. ‚ÄúThis signals growing caution among institutional investors,‚Äù QCP concluded. Looking Ahead: Market Uncertainty Persists With inflation concerns still present and institutional investors adopting a more cautious approach, Bitcoin‚Äôs short-term price action remains uncertain. However, key support levels around $82,000 appear to be holding for now. As traders and investors navigate these developments, all eyes remain on the Federal Reserve‚Äôs upcoming policy decisions and how they might impact broader market sentiment.",Bitcoin|Crypto News Today|Crypto Intelligence,EN,0,0,BTC|TRADING|MARKET|BUSINESS|FIAT,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2025-03-12 22:45:38

While some market participants see President Donald Trump‚Äôs latest executive order as overshadowed by economic uncertainty, K33 analysts insist the initiative is far from insignificant. K33 Head of Research Vetle Lunde and Senior Analyst David Zimmerman noted in a report that the ETH/BTC ratio has also reached its lowest point since December 2020, highlighting Ethereum‚Äôs relative underperformance. Analysts noted that Trump appeared unconcerned about recession risks, instead focusing on lowering U.S. 10-year Treasury yields to help the government refinancing efforts. That, combined with uncertainty about the administration‚Äôs changing stance on tariffs, led to declines in the S&P 500 and Nasdaq, both of which reached their lowest levels since mid-September. Despite these challenges, Bitcoin has gained about 13% since the presidential election, outperforming the Nasdaq and S&P 500, which have both returned negative over the same period. Lunde and Zimmerman attribute this resilience to Trump‚Äôs steadfast stance on crypto, including the creation of a dedicated crypto working group and the announcement of the U.S. Strategic Bitcoin Reserve last week. Related News: Bitcoin Bull Cathie Wood's Company Speaks About BTC For The First Time After The Fall - Still Bullish? ‚ÄúWe fundamentally disagree with experts who attribute the recent sell-off to the inadequacy of the U.S. Bitcoin reserve,‚Äù the analysts wrote, adding: ‚ÄúThis reserve represents a turning point for Bitcoin. It is an important step in legitimizing BTC as a global store of value despite widespread market volatility. While macroeconomic uncertainties persist, we see the current price environment as a strong opportunity for long-term accumulation.‚Äù Trump‚Äôs executive order signed on March 6 officially established the US Strategic Bitcoin Reserve. The reserve will consist of approximately 200,000 BTC ($17 billion) currently under federal surveillance due to asset seizures related to criminal and civil cases. However, some of these funds must be returned to crime victims, leaving an estimated 103,500 BTC in the reserve at its official launch. In particular, the 94,636 BTC seized in the Bitfinex attack is expected to be returned to the exchange rather than kept in the reserve. ‚ÄúThe most influential global superpower has signaled an end to the Bitcoin seizure sales; neither current nor future seizures will be liquidated,‚Äù the analysts wrote, adding: ‚ÄúFurthermore, the administration is actively exploring ways to accumulate more. This could set a precedent for other countries and signal the beginning of a new era for Bitcoin. Given these developments, we believe the current landscape is extremely favorable for long-term Bitcoin accumulation, while short-term uncertainties remain.‚Äù *This is not investment advice.

Imagine a world where developing sophisticated AI agents becomes significantly easier, thanks to a powerful runtime environment designed from the ground up for distributed systems. That vision is now closer to reality with the latest advancements in Dapr. What is Dapr and Why Does it Matter for AI Agents? Back in 2019, tech giant Microsoft open-sourced Dapr (Distributed Application Runtime), a groundbreaking runtime environment aimed at simplifying the development of distributed, microservice-based applications. While AI agents weren‚Äôt the primary buzzword then, Dapr‚Äôs foundational architecture inherently contained key elements perfectly suited for supporting them. At its core, Dapr features ‚Äòvirtual actors‚Äô ‚Äì independent units that can process messages autonomously. This actor model turns out to be exceptionally well-aligned with the needs of modern AI agents . Now, the Dapr team is taking this a step further with the launch of Dapr Agents . This new initiative is specifically designed to provide developers with the essential building blocks for creating and deploying AI agents effectively. Yaron Schneider, co-creator and maintainer of Dapr, highlights the natural synergy: ‚Äú AI Agents are a very good use case for Dapr . From a technical standpoint, actors offer a lightweight and scalable way to run these agents with state management and resource efficiency. While frameworks and workflow engines exist, they often lack the orchestration and statefulness that Dapr inherently provides.‚Äù Key Benefits of Dapr for AI Agents: Scalability and Efficiency: Dapr‚Äôs actor model enables the creation of highly scalable AI agents that can be efficiently managed and run, optimizing resource utilization. State Management: Built-in state management capabilities ensure AI agents can maintain context and data across interactions, crucial for complex tasks and long-running processes. Orchestration: Dapr provides robust orchestration features to coordinate interactions between AI agents and other components of a distributed system, simplifying complex workflows. Simplified Development: By abstracting away the complexities of distributed systems, Dapr allows developers to focus on the core logic of their AI agents , accelerating development cycles. From Floki to Dapr Agents: An Open Source Evolution The genesis of Dapr Agents lies in Floki, a popular open-source project that extended Dapr to specifically cater to AI agent use cases. Recognizing the potential and community interest, the Dapr and Floki teams, including Microsoft AI researcher Roberto Rodriguez, joined forces to bring Floki under the official Dapr umbrella. This collaboration ensures the continued development and support of this powerful new framework for AI agents . Mark Fussell, another co-creator and maintainer of Dapr, aptly describes the shift in perspective: ‚ÄúIn many ways, we see agentic systems and the terminology around them as another term for ‚Äò distributed systems .‚Äô Rather than calling them microservices, you can now call them agents, especially with the integration of large language models.‚Äù The core principle remains the same: efficient coordination and statefulness are paramount, whether you‚Äôre building microservices or sophisticated AI agents . This is precisely where Dapr excels. How Dapr Empowers Distributed AI Systems Dapr ‚Äòs architecture is ideally suited for the demands of distributed systems , particularly those involving AI agents . Its actor model is designed for extreme efficiency, enabling agents to spin up in milliseconds when a message arrives and gracefully shut down once their task is complete, all while preserving their state. This ephemeral and stateful nature is critical for building responsive and resource-conscious AI applications. Connectivity and Tooling: Broad Model Support: Dapr Agents offer out-of-the-box compatibility with leading model providers, including AWS Bedrock, OpenAI, Anthropic, Mistral, and Hugging Face. Support for local LLMs is also on the horizon. Tool Integration: Extending the existing Dapr framework, Dapr Agents allow developers to define a suite of tools that agents can leverage to accomplish specific tasks. This modularity and extensibility are key to building versatile AI agents . Language Support: Currently, Dapr Agents supports Python, with .NET support launching imminently. Java, JavaScript, and Go support are planned to follow, ensuring broad accessibility for developers across different ecosystems. Unlocking the Potential of Open Source AI with Dapr The introduction of Dapr Agents marks a significant step forward in making open source AI development more accessible and manageable. By providing a robust and scalable runtime environment, Dapr empowers developers to build complex, distributed AI agent applications with greater ease and efficiency. As the AI landscape continues to evolve, tools like Dapr will be instrumental in democratizing access to advanced AI technologies and fostering innovation within the open source AI community. Key Takeaways: Feature Benefit for AI Agents Virtual Actors Scalable and efficient agent execution State Management Persistent agent context and data Orchestration Engine Simplified coordination of complex AI workflows Broad Model Support Integration with leading AI model providers Tool Integration Extensible agent capabilities Embrace the Future of AI with Dapr Dapr ‚Äòs embrace of AI agents signifies a pivotal moment in the evolution of both microservices and artificial intelligence. By leveraging the power of Dapr ‚Äòs runtime, developers can now confidently build and deploy sophisticated AI agent applications that are scalable, resilient, and easier to manage than ever before. This move not only simplifies the development process but also opens up exciting new possibilities for the future of AI in distributed environments.

Kevin points to several convergent technical indicators, including a back test of the macro 0.5 Fibonacci retracement near $0.158, a retest of descending multi‚Äêyear trend lines, a convergence with both the 200‚Äêweek Simple Moving Average (SMA) and Exponential Moving Average (EMA), and an historically low 3‚ÄêDay RSI reading. Buy Dogecoin Now? The DOGE/USD weekly chart reveals several Fibonacci retracement lines that may serve as support or potential downside targets. Around $0.158, Dogecoin is testing the 0.5 Fib level, while deeper areas include 0.618 near $0.1157, 0.65 near $0.1092, 0.70 around $0.097, 0.786 near $0.080, and a more distant 1.0 Fib labeled around $0.0942. Historically, these Fib zones have been areas where price action may stabilize if a downtrend continues. Kevin also highlights resistance near $0.28 (the 0.236 Fib) and an upper boundary around $0.47‚Äì$0.48 that marks a major swing high from previous rallies. From a trend perspective, the price is hovering in the $0.16‚Äì$0.17 region, where it is retesting the broken descending trend line drawn from Dogecoin‚Äôs 2021 peaks. Kevin‚Äôs analysis suggests that if Dogecoin can hold this line as support, it would reinforce the bullish scenario. Related Reading: Dogecoin‚Äôs Darkest Hour? Sentiment Tanks, Whales Accumulate In tandem, the 200‚Äêweek SMA and EMA‚Äîoften regarded as markers of long‚Äêterm market health‚Äîare situated in the approximate $0.13‚Äì$0.17 corridor. The overlap between these critical moving averages and the Fib levels underscores what Kevin sees as a strong risk‚Äêto‚Äêreward setup for long‚Äêterm positioning. He also points out that the 3‚ÄêDay RSI has reached territory he considers ‚Äúhistorically low,‚Äù hinting at a possible oversold condition. Beyond technical considerations, Kevin expresses a broader macroeconomic viewpoint: ‚ÄúIf BTC holds up and Macro Economic Data and Monetary policy adjust then you just got your last opportunity to buy Dogecoin relatively cheap. A lot of factors at play and lots of work to do But the risk reward at this level is superb given the circumstances.‚Äù He suggests that despite strong employment numbers and moderating inflation (supported by Truflation data and falling energy costs), the market is ‚Äúwiping out trillions of dollars of wealth everyday on pure speculation of what imaginary Tariffs are gonna do that they knew were coming.‚Äù Related Reading: Dogecoin Crash? Analyst Predicts Drop To $0.12 Before Rebound He adds: ‚ÄúEmployment numbers are phenomenal, growth is still strong, inflation is coming down rapidly per Truflation data and energy costs falling are the reason, the Fed is about to start easing again, wars are getting ready to end soon.‚Äù He argues that the Federal Reserve may soon pivot to more accommodative policies and that ongoing geopolitical tensions may be waning.

Simultaneously, analysts are highlighting an AI token that appears poised to deliver astronomical returns of 5,437% before June 2025: FloppyPepe (FPPE). Ethereum Price Surge: A Prelude To Bullish Trends The current market indicators suggest that the Ethereum price is poised for a dramatic surge. Analysts report that the huge amounts of Ethereum (ETH) purchased in the last 72 hours, along with the fallout from the Bybit hack, could boost the price. With each progressive update and strategic network upgrade, Ethereum (ETH) is drawing closer to its next significant milestone. Additional market research reveals that a stabilized Ethereum price is likely to attract even more participation from both seasoned and emerging market players. A comprehensive analysis of recent trends indicates that an upward shift in the Ethereum price signifies market recovery and serves as an indicator of broader altcoin momentum. FloppyPepe (FPPE): From Iconic Art To AI Token King FloppyPepe (FPPE) has rapidly positioned itself as a premier AI token, garnering attention from both market aficionados and crypto newbies alike. Conceived by the genius mind of Matt Furie, the creator of Pepe the Frog, whose cultural imprint spans far beyond his original canvas, FloppyPepe (FPPE) not only cements his legacy as a visionary in the crypto space but also redefines the capabilities of an AI token in the digital asset arena. The token‚Äôs robust security is reinforced by its smart contract, which blockchain security expert SolidProof rigorously audited. This diligence has fortified FloppyPepe‚Äôs (FPPE) position as one of the most reliable AI tokens available today. Further bolstering its appeal, FloppyPepe (FPPE) is collaborating with a top-leading artist to produce regular, hand-drawn pieces of FloppyPepe (FPPE) art, a creative endeavor. This creative endeavor, visual identity, and cultural cachet. At the core of FloppyPepe‚Äôs (FPPE) design is a deflationary tokenomics model. Each transaction involving this AI token burns 1% of tokens to increase scarcity while redistributing 3% to the community. This mechanism rewards long-term holders and contributes to a gradual reduction in the circulating supply, which could drive up the token‚Äôs value over time. Complementing this, the ecosystem introduces FloppyX , a cutting-edge AI agent that generates videos through text interactions, delivering consistent characters and incorporating real-time polls, feedback, and sentiment analysis. Alongside FloppyX is Meme-o-Matic , an AI agent designed to generate witty memes from submitted texts, video clips, and images, further amplifying community engagement. The newly integrated FloppyAI within this AI token also handles diverse inputs ranging from user queries to real-time market data. By applying advanced techniques such as natural language processing, pattern recognition, and predictive modeling, the system generates outputs in textual and visual formats while executing automated operational actions within the FloppyPepe (FPPE) ecosystem. This continuous feedback loop refines the AI token‚Äôs responses and adapts to shifting market dynamics. Recent developments include an AI video agent that produces high-quality videos and an AI text-to-image agent that was recently introduced to the Telegram community. Both are designed to expand the token‚Äôs utility and broaden its appeal. Notably, the ongoing presale for this AI token is attractively priced at $0.0000002 . The private round sold out within 24 hours and raised $907,200 . Act Now: Join The Presale For A Historic Crypto Leap With the rise of the Ethereum price, the ascent of a formidable AI token creates a market scenario that is truly beneficial for crypto enthusiasts who want to cash in and become wealthy. As the rising Ethereum price continues to fuel market optimism, and the unique features behind FloppyPepe (FPPE) are setting the stage for a paradigm shift in the digital asset realm. Early momentum is unmistakable. The private round of this AI token sold out within 24 hours to raise $907,200, a clear signal of the market‚Äôs confidence in its ability to transform lives and create unimaginable wealth.

This urgent development, first reported by Cointelegraph, signals a significant escalation in the global crackdown on illicit activities within the digital asset space. But who exactly is Aleksej Be≈°ciokov, and what does this Garantex founder arrest mean for the future of crypto exchanges? Who is Aleksej Be≈°ciokov and What is Garantex? Before diving into the specifics of the arrest, it‚Äôs crucial to understand who Aleksej Be≈°ciokov is and the nature of Garantex. Garantex is a cryptocurrency exchange that has come under intense scrutiny, particularly from the United States, due to concerns about its role in facilitating illicit financial flows. Here‚Äôs a quick rundown: Aleksej Be≈°ciokov: The founder of Garantex, now in the custody of Indian authorities. He is facing serious charges in the U.S., painting a picture of a key figure in the controversial world of crypto exchanges. Garantex: A Russian cryptocurrency exchange sanctioned by the U.S. Department of the Treasury‚Äôs Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC). The exchange has been flagged for allegedly enabling money laundering and facilitating transactions for illicit actors. The U.S. authorities have been keeping a close watch on Garantex, and Be≈°ciokov‚Äôs arrest underscores the international reach of law enforcement in targeting individuals associated with exchanges deemed to be operating outside the bounds of regulatory compliance. Unpacking the Money Laundering Charges: Why Was Be≈°ciokov Arrested? The arrest isn‚Äôt just about regulatory breaches; it‚Äôs about serious criminal allegations. Aleksej Be≈°ciokov is facing significant charges in the United States, including: Conspiracy to Launder Money: This is a grave charge indicating that Be≈°ciokov is accused of being involved in schemes to conceal the origins of illegally obtained funds, using Garantex as a conduit. Conspiracy to Operate an Unlicensed Money Transmitter: This charge suggests that Garantex allegedly functioned as a money transmitting business without the necessary licenses and in violation of U.S. laws. These money laundering charges highlight the severity of the situation. The U.S. sees these actions as a threat to financial integrity and national security. The accusations paint a picture of Garantex as more than just a platform for trading crypto; it‚Äôs portrayed as a potential tool for criminal activities. The extradition request from the U.S. further emphasizes the seriousness with which American authorities are treating this case. India‚Äôs Role and the Extradition Process: What Happens Next? India‚Äôs involvement in this arrest is pivotal. Be≈°ciokov was apprehended by the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI), India‚Äôs premier investigative agency. This signifies international cooperation in tackling crypto-related crime. But what does this mean for Be≈°ciokov and the extradition process? Arrest in India: Be≈°ciokov‚Äôs arrest in India demonstrates the global reach of international law enforcement and the willingness of nations to collaborate on such cases. Extradition to the U.S.: He is expected to be extradited to the United States in accordance with India‚Äôs Extradition Act. This legal process could involve hearings and appeals, but the initial signs point towards cooperation between India and the U.S. Legal Framework: India‚Äôs Extradition Act provides the legal basis for sending individuals accused of crimes in other countries back to face justice. This case will test and highlight the effectiveness of this framework in the context of cryptocurrency-related offenses. The India extradition process is now set to begin, and it will be closely watched by the crypto community and legal experts alike. It underscores the increasing legal ramifications for individuals operating in the crypto space, regardless of their geographical location. Is This Part of a Broader Crypto Exchange Crackdown? Be≈°ciokov‚Äôs arrest isn‚Äôt an isolated incident. It‚Äôs happening amidst a global push for stricter regulation and enforcement within the cryptocurrency sector. Governments worldwide are becoming increasingly concerned about the potential for crypto exchanges to be used for illicit activities. Is this the start of a larger crypto exchange crackdown ? Global Regulatory Scrutiny: Regulators across the globe are tightening their grip on crypto exchanges. Concerns about money laundering, terrorist financing, and sanctions evasion are driving this increased scrutiny. Increased Enforcement Actions: We‚Äôre seeing a rise in enforcement actions against crypto platforms that are perceived to be non-compliant or facilitating illegal activities. Garantex is just one example, but many other exchanges are under the microscope. International Cooperation: The Be≈°ciokov arrest highlights the growing collaboration between international law enforcement agencies. Countries are working together to share information and coordinate actions against crypto crime. This trend suggests that the era of loosely regulated crypto exchanges might be coming to an end. Exchanges operating internationally need to be more vigilant about compliance and anti-money laundering (AML) measures. The arrest sends a clear message: there are real-world consequences for failing to adhere to global financial regulations. What Does This Arrest Mean for the Crypto Industry? The arrest of Aleksej Be≈°ciokov is more than just about one individual or one exchange. It has broader implications for the entire cryptocurrency industry. What lessons can be learned, and what impact will this have on the future of crypto? Heightened Compliance Demands: Crypto exchanges worldwide will likely face even greater pressure to enhance their compliance frameworks. This includes robust KYC (Know Your Customer) and AML procedures. Increased User Scrutiny: Users of crypto exchanges may become more cautious and discerning, opting for platforms with a proven track record of regulatory compliance and transparency. Potential for Market Consolidation: Stricter regulations and enforcement actions could lead to market consolidation, with smaller, less compliant exchanges struggling to survive, while larger, more regulated platforms gain dominance. Focus on Decentralization vs. Regulation: This situation reignites the ongoing debate about decentralization in crypto versus the need for regulation. Finding the right balance remains a critical challenge for the industry. The case of Aleksej Be≈°ciokov and Garantex serves as a stark reminder that the crypto industry is not immune to traditional financial regulations and law enforcement. It underscores the necessity for crypto businesses to operate within legal frameworks and prioritize compliance to avoid severe repercussions. Conclusion: A Watershed Moment for Crypto Regulation The arrest of Garantex founder Aleksej Be≈°ciokov in India marks a significant moment in the ongoing evolution of cryptocurrency regulation. It demonstrates the increasing global cooperation in tackling crypto-related crime and sends a clear message to exchanges operating in the grey areas of compliance. As the extradition process unfolds and more details emerge, the crypto industry will be closely watching, understanding that this case could set precedents for future enforcement actions. The era of unchecked crypto operations is swiftly closing, paving the way for a more regulated and, hopefully, more secure digital asset ecosystem.

Changing enforcement approaches are emerging within the US crypto sector. Ripple‚Äôs legal strategy reflects a broader industry adjustment in oversight. The resolution may shape how future digital asset disputes are handled. The United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has moved closer to ending its prolonged legal battle against Ripple, according to Fox Business reporter Eleanor Terrett in a March 12 X post. Ripple, SEC Allegedly Nearing Agreement According to Terrett‚Äôs post on Wednesday, two sources familiar with the matter claim the SEC is considering ending its legal dispute with Ripple once final terms are agreed upon. SCOOP: Two well-placed sources tell me that the @SECGov vs. @Ripple case is in the process of wrapping up and could be over soon. My understanding is that the delay in reaching an agreement is due to Ripple's legal team negotiating more favorable terms regarding the August‚Ä¶ ‚Äî Eleanor Terrett (@EleanorTerrett) March 12, 2025 Negotiations have reportedly stalled due to Ripple‚Äôs legal team seeking a more favorable outcome concerning a July 2023 ruling by District Court Judge Analisa Torres , which required the company to pay a $125 million fine. The ruling was viewed as a partial win for Ripple, as the imposed fine was substantially lower than the nearly $2 billion originally sought by the SEC. In October 2024, the SEC appealed Torres‚Äô ruling, a move Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse criticized for damaging the regulator‚Äôs credibility and reputation. If Gensler and the SEC were rational, they would have moved on from this case long ago. It certainly hasn‚Äôt protected investors and instead has damaged the credibility and reputation of the SEC.

Crypto Sector Sees Regulatory Changes In The U.S. News of the potential deal comes amid broader regulatory shifts in the SEC‚Äôs approach to the blockchain industry following the resignation of former chair Gary Gensler. During Gensler‚Äôs tenure, the agency pursued multiple lawsuits against major crypto firms, including Kraken, Coinbase, and Consensys. Recently, the SEC has dropped several digital asset-related lawsuits, though cases against major firms like Coinbase and Robinhood remain ongoing. Former U.S. President Donald Trump has voiced support for cryptocurrency regulations but has received mixed reactions from the crypto community regarding his stance. If the SEC settles with Ripple, the company would be among a growing list of crypto firms no longer facing regulatory penalties. Ripple‚Äôs Fate and the Bigger Picture A resolution to the SEC‚Äôs case against Ripple would be a victory for the company, but the broader fight over crypto regulation remains far from settled. While some firms have seen enforcement actions dropped, others continue to face legal challenges, highlighting the fragmented approach that has left the industry in limbo. A shift away from aggressive lawsuits may signal a more measured strategy, but without a defined regulatory framework, digital asset firms remain in a state of uncertainty. The question now is whether policymakers will seize the moment to provide clarity or leave the industry guessing once again. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) How might a resolution in the SEC-Ripple case influence US crypto regulations? Resolving this legal dispute may prompt regulators to recalibrate their enforcement strategies, fostering a clearer framework for digital asset operations. Such a shift might influence oversight in similar future cases. What could this settlement mean for Ripple‚Äôs market outlook? A resolution might boost investor confidence and refine market perceptions about Ripple‚Äôs operational stance. This could also encourage a steadier regulatory environment for other digital asset ventures. How does this development affect future crypto legal challenges? This outcome may set a precedent, prompting clearer legal interpretations in crypto disputes. A defined resolution could reshape judicial reviews and strategies for regulators and digital asset firms in future challenges.

41560527,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=139600,1741821041,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Altcoin ETF Approval Halted: Uncertainty Grips Crypto Market as SEC Chairman Wait Continues,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/altcoin-etf-approval-halted/,"Excitement around Altcoin ETFs has hit a snag, leaving investors in suspense. The much-anticipated approval of exchange-traded funds (ETFs) for cryptocurrencies beyond Bitcoin and Ethereum is now facing significant delays. Why? The crypto community is pointing towards the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and the ongoing wait for a new chairman. Let‚Äôs dive into what this means for the future of Altcoin ETF and the broader crypto market. Why is the SEC Chairman Appointment Crucial for ETF Approval? The leadership at the SEC plays a pivotal role in shaping regulatory decisions, especially concerning innovative financial products like cryptocurrency ETFs. Currently, the SEC is awaiting the confirmation of a new chairman nominated by former U.S. President Donald Trump, Paul Atkins. Until this appointment is finalized and the new chairman takes office, major policy decisions, including the green light for ETF Approval for altcoins, are likely to remain in limbo. Here‚Äôs why the chairman‚Äôs role is so critical: Policy Direction: The chairman sets the overall agenda and regulatory tone for the SEC. A chairman with a more favorable or understanding stance towards crypto could expedite the review and approval process for crypto-related investment products. Decision-Making Authority: While decisions are often made collectively by the commissioners, the chairman‚Äôs influence is substantial. They can steer discussions, prioritize agendas, and influence the direction of investigations and approvals. Regulatory Clarity: A new chairman can bring fresh perspectives and potentially push for clearer regulatory frameworks for digital assets. This clarity is essential for the SEC to confidently approve complex financial instruments like Cryptocurrency ETF s. Altcoin ETF Approval: What‚Äôs the Current Status? Recent developments indicate a continued cautious approach from the SEC towards expanding crypto investment options. According to a CoinDesk report, the SEC has recently extended the review deadlines for several spot Altcoin ETF applications. These include ETFs focused on popular cryptocurrencies like: XRP (XRP ETF) Solana (SOL ETF) Dogecoin (DOGE ETF) Litecoin (LTC ETF) This extension of deadlines suggests that the SEC is not yet ready to give the nod to these products. The reasons for delay are multifaceted and likely include ongoing concerns about market manipulation, investor protection, and the overall maturity of the altcoin market. Paul Atkins: Potential New SEC Chairman ‚Äì What Does It Mean for Crypto? The nomination of Paul Atkins as the potential new SEC Chairman has sparked discussions within the crypto community. Atkins, a former SEC commissioner himself, is known for his pro-market stance and has previously expressed concerns about over-regulation. His potential appointment could signal a shift in the SEC‚Äôs approach to digital assets. However, it‚Äôs important to note: Nomination vs. Confirmation: While nominated by former President Trump, Atkins still needs to undergo a confirmation hearing. The date for this hearing remains unset, introducing further uncertainty. Potential Policy Shift: If confirmed, Atkins could bring a more industry-friendly perspective to the SEC. This might lead to a more streamlined process for reviewing and potentially approving Cryptocurrency ETF s, including those for altcoins. No Guarantees: Even with a potentially favorable chairman, the approval of Altcoin ETF s is not guaranteed. The SEC will still need to address its concerns regarding market risks and ensure investor protection. The Ripple Effect: Impact of Delayed ETF Approval on the Crypto Market The delay in ETF Approval for altcoins has several implications for the cryptocurrency market: Investor Sentiment: The prolonged wait can dampen investor enthusiasm, especially among institutional investors who are keen to access crypto markets through regulated and familiar investment vehicles like ETFs. Market Access: ETFs provide broader market access, particularly for retail investors who may find it challenging to directly hold and manage cryptocurrencies. Delays restrict this access and potentially slow down mainstream adoption. Price Volatility: Uncertainty surrounding regulatory approvals can contribute to price volatility in the altcoin market. Positive news about potential ETF approvals often leads to price surges, while delays can trigger dips. Competitive Landscape: Other regions, like Europe and Canada, have already approved Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs. The US lagging behind in Cryptocurrency ETF approvals could impact its competitive position in the global crypto landscape. Navigating the Uncertainty: What Can Crypto Investors Do? In the face of this regulatory uncertainty, what steps can crypto investors take? Stay Informed: Keep abreast of regulatory developments, SEC announcements, and news regarding the chairman appointment. Reliable sources like CoinDesk and other reputable crypto news outlets are crucial. Diversify Investments: Diversification remains a key strategy in volatile markets. Don‚Äôt put all your eggs in one basket, especially when it comes to speculative assets like altcoins. Long-Term Perspective: Regulatory processes can be lengthy. Maintain a long-term investment perspective and avoid making impulsive decisions based on short-term news cycles. Engage with the Community: Participate in discussions and forums to understand the broader market sentiment and share insights with fellow investors. Conclusion: The Waiting Game for Altcoin ETFs Continues The path to Altcoin ETF approval in the US remains uncertain, largely dependent on the appointment and approach of the new SEC chairman. While the nomination of Paul Atkins offers a glimmer of hope for a potentially more crypto-friendly regulatory environment, the confirmation process and subsequent policy shifts are not guaranteed. For now, the crypto market must continue to navigate this period of regulatory ambiguity, with investors closely watching for any signals that might indicate a change in direction from the SEC. The dream of easily accessible and regulated Cryptocurrency ETF s for a wider range of digital assets is still alive, but patience remains the name of the game.

Despite a surprise softening of US consumer price inflation that gives the Fed room to ease rates later in 2025, per data released on Wednesday, has failed to substantially lift the Ethereum price, which continues to languish well below $2,000. That‚Äôs despite a solid recovery from lows of other major cryptos like Bitcoin , XRP and BNB . Indeed, the ETH/BTC ration just hit its lowest level in nearly 5 years under 0.023. Ethereum‚Äôs accelerating downwards spiral versus Bitcoin is of major concern to its investors. At this rate, a retest of its 2019 lows around 0.016 could come imminently. And with the Ethereum price chart sending strong bearish signals, more downside is very likely. Here‚Äôs Where the Ethereum Price is Headed Next The Ethereum price has seen a break below, then rejection of the key long-term $2,140 resistance level in recent days. That sends a strong bearish signal that the 2024- early 2024 $2,000-$4,000 range is a thing of the past, and that Ethereum is likely to find a new range at lower levels. Bears will be eyeing a retest of the next major support zone around $1,500. A retest of these levels seems very likely in the context of an uncertain macro backdrop. Yes, softening US inflation gives the Fed more room to signal a slightly more dovish stance in 2025. But the markets main concern will remain growing US recession risk as D.O.G.E austerity and Trump trade war uncertainty start to take their toll economic growth. Mohamed El-Erian, a Bloomberg Opinion columnist, says the chance of a US recession is now at 25%-30%. El-Erian had the probability of a recession at 10% at the beginning of the year https://t.co/uM8FjGPhCZ pic.twitter.com/aT7P39i72f ‚Äî Bloomberg TV (@BloombergTV) March 12, 2025 If recession signals keep piling up in the coming weeks, and the market isn‚Äôt sufficiently satisfied that the Fed will be there to ‚Äúsave the day‚Äù, risk appetite is likely to continue to deteriorate. And while Bitcoin could hold up well thanks to strengthening narratives around it as a safe-haven, store of wealth asset, which have been emboldened since the Trump administration announced the creation of a strategic Bitcoin reserve , Ethereum is unlikely to receive much of a bid. Fundamentals thus suggest a retest of $1,500 is looking very likely. Buy the Ethereum Dip? So if the Ethereum price is destined to collapse to lower levels, would this be a good time for investors to buy the dip. Yes, for investors willing to hold through significant near-term turbulence, buying any ETH dip would likely be a good move. Macro uncertainties will not last forever. And, at some point, US financial conditions are likely to to substantially ease, meaning a surge of liquidity in the market. Prior periods of strong Ethereum price performance have come at times of increased/increasing liquidity from the Fed. So a strong rebound is to be expected as the Fed juices the market. Meanwhile, over the longer term, tailwinds from the Trump administration‚Äôs pro-crypto policy stance should also aid Ethereum. Eric Trump likes Ethereum. pic.twitter.com/Bl0s1zeygF ‚Äî Altcoin Daily (@AltcoinDailyio) February 3, 2025 The Trump administration is full of ETH HODLers. And regulatory clarity will give the Ethereum ecosystem a lot of room to grow over the coming years. Traders must also remember that Ethereum remains the dominant DeFi chain, and the most trusted smart contract blockchain in crypto, hence its backing from BlackRock. As ugly as things look right now, and as much FUD as there is in the market, Ethereum‚Äôs long-term outlook remains strong. Its biggest problem into the future is likely to remain a deteriorating market share as nimbler rivals attract new users at a faster rather than Ethereum does. That said, Ethereum is still far and away the best candidate for major institutions looking to take part in DeFi, thanks to its status as the most trusted and decentralized of the smart contract blockchains. Accumulating ETH as it approaches $1,500 with a view to hold for at least a few years could be a great strategy. Investors should not rule out the possibility that ETH reaches $10,000 by the end of Trump‚Äôs four year term.

The law regulates cryptocurrency automatic teller machines (ATMs). It establishes conditions for operating crypto ATMs and provides consumer protections for ATM users. The bill passed the state‚Äôs 49-member nonpartisan, unicameral legislature on March 6 with 48 votes in favor and one legislator excused from voting. Governor Jim Pillen signed the bill on March 11. The act makes ATM operators liable for some fraud Under the new law , crypto ATM operators must have a money transmitter license. They are required to make their fees known in advance and post clear warnings about potential scams and other risks associated with cryptocurrency. New customers will be limited to $2,000 a day in transactions, and established customers will be allowed $10,500 a day. Operators will also have to have a refund policy for customers who report fraud within 30 days. New customers are eligible for a full refund on funds lost to fraud while existing customers would get fees returned. Operators will be required to have a full-time compliance officer and an anti-fraud policy backed up by the use of blockchain analytics software. They will provide live customer service on weekdays from 7:00 a.m. to 9:00 p.m. and a ‚Äúdedicated communication method‚Äù with law enforcement. The governor spun the new law as support for the crypto industry. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôve been working hard to build Nebraska into a cryptocurrency leader. An important part of these efforts is to make sure that we have guardrails to prevent criminals from taking advantage of Nebraskans,‚Äù Pillen said in a statement announcing the bill‚Äôs signing. According to the American Association of Retired Persons (AARP), Nebraskans reported 239 scams with cryptocurrency in 2023. They lost a cumulative $14.6 million in those scams. Real losses were probably much higher but unreported, the AARP added. Nebraska has passed several acts affecting crypto The bill was introduced by Eliot Bostar in January. The law will go into effect three months after the legislature adjourns for Spring. According to Bitcoinlaws.io, there is no other Bitcoin-related legislation¬†currently being considered in the state. There is, however, a bill introduced at the request of the governor that would¬†impose¬†a 2.5-cent per kWh excise tax on cryptocurrency mining operations consuming over 1,000 kWh annually and allow public power districts to require financial assurances from these operations, among other things. That bill is currently in hearings. Bostar introduced the Adopt the Blockchain Basics Act, which would have regulated cryptocurrency mining, custody, and trading, in 2023. That bill was carried over into 2024, but its¬†status¬†since April has been ‚Äúindefinitely postponed.‚Äù Nebraska hosts Telcoin Bank, an issuer of the eUSD stablecoin. Telcoin was chartered as the state‚Äôs first Digital Asset Depository Institution in February, after applying in December. Telcoin founder and CEO Paul Neuner said, ‚ÄúThe Nebraska charter creates an actual bank charter and the first that is explicitly authorized to connect consumers to DeFi [decentralized finance].‚Äù The concept of Digital Asset Depository Institution was introduced in the Nebraska Financial Innovation Act of 2021. That law established a regulatory framework for digital asset depositories and allowed existing state-chartered banks to operate digital asset divisions. It also brought state legislation in line with the Uniform Commercial Code. Nebraska was also one of the 18 states that sued the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and its then-chair Gary Gensler in November, alleging the agency and its head had shown ‚Äúgross government overreach.‚Äù Cryptopolitan Academy: Tired of market swings?

Among the notable players are Qubetics, Bittensor TAO, and Bitcoin Cash, all of which have demonstrated significant potential for exponential returns. With the market‚Äôs volatility and fluctuating sentiment, these cryptocurrencies stand out for their resilience, innovation, and underlying technologies. For those looking for high-reward opportunities, these cryptos have captured the attention of the broader community. Bitcoin Cash (BCH) is proving its strength, managing to hold steady above critical support levels while offering participants a glimpse of growth potential. Meanwhile, Bittensor TAO is showing promising signs of recovery, poised to break key resistance levels with the backing of Bitcoin‚Äôs recent rally. As market conditions shift in favor of bullish movements, these two projects offer a solid foundation for those seeking best cryptos for exponential returns. Now, a new contender has entered the stage: Qubetics. Unlike its predecessors, Qubetics is focused on solving real-world problems that have plagued the blockchain and digital finance sectors. With its Real World Asset Tokenisation Marketplace, Qubetics aims to provide businesses, professionals, and individuals with the tools they need to navigate the ever-evolving world of digital assets. Qubetics: A New Era in Blockchain and Digital Finance Qubetics is making waves with its innovative approach to tokenizing real-world assets. The Real World Asset Tokenisation Marketplace aims to bridge the gap between traditional assets and the digital world. By allowing businesses and individuals to tokenize physical and digital assets, Qubetics will facilitate faster, more secure, and more transparent transactions. This platform is set to revolutionize how assets are traded and exchanged. For professionals and businesses, the ability to tokenize real-world assets provides opportunities to unlock liquidity, reduce barriers to entry, and create a more dynamic market for assets that were previously illiquid. Participants in the Qubetics presale have already witnessed significant momentum, with the $TICS token currently priced at $0.1074. As the presale progresses, experts predict substantial returns, with potential for 830% to 9,206% ROI after the mainnet launch, making Qubetics a prime candidate for those seeking best cryptos for exponential returns. The crypto presale is currently in its 25th stage, having sold over 499 million tokens to more than 22,900 holders. As the project continues to build momentum, early adopters are positioning themselves for significant gains. With a projected $TICS price increase to $1 after the presale, and potential for $5 to $15 following the mainnet launch, the community is buzzing with excitement over Qubetics‚Äô potential to solve long-standing issues in the blockchain space as one of the best cryptos for exponential returns. Bittensor TAO: A Rising Star in Blockchain Bittensor (TAO) is making a comeback after a rough period, and its prospects are looking bright. Following a 30% decline, TAO has rebounded by 13.93% in the last 24 hours, signaling strong upward momentum. Analysts are closely watching as TAO is testing a falling wedge breakout, a historically bullish pattern that could propel the price toward a $400 target. The recent market recovery, led by Bitcoin, has provided TAO with the support it needs to push toward new highs. TAO‚Äôs technical analysis suggests that if it can clear key resistance levels, it could potentially reach its target price of $400, offering participants a solid opportunity for exponential returns. The market‚Äôs current bullish sentiment is favoring altcoins like TAO, making it an ideal time for those looking to capitalize on the recovery. TAO‚Äôs blockchain network is particularly attractive due to its focus on artificial intelligence (AI), offering decentralized machine learning models. This innovative technology is drawing attention from the crypto community, with expectations that it will drive future growth and adoption. For those seeking exposure to the AI sector through blockchain, TAO provides an enticing entry point. Bitcoin Cash (BCH): Resilience Amidst Volatility Bitcoin Cash (BCH) has demonstrated resilience during periods of market turbulence, managing to stabilize above the $345 support level after a 5% drop. Despite the broader market downturn, BCH has shown more strength compared to Bitcoin, which posted losses of over 8%. BCH‚Äôs ability to hold key support levels is a positive sign for backers looking for stability in a volatile market. However, the derivatives markets reveal some downside risks. BCH could face significant sell-offs if the price falls below the $339 level, as many bear traders have already placed short positions, potentially triggering liquidations. Yet, BCH has shown that it can recover from such pullbacks, making it an attractive option for those looking for a more stable crypto asset that has the potential for exponential returns if it regains upward momentum. With increasing network activity and the potential for positive catalysts in the market, Bitcoin Cash remains a strong contender for those interested in capturing long-term gains. While the risk of downside exists, BCH‚Äôs robust infrastructure and backing by a loyal community position it as a resilient cryptocurrency in times of market uncertainty. Final Thoughts As the crypto market continues to evolve, community members and participants are presented with unique opportunities to generate exponential returns. Qubetics, Bittensor TAO, and Bitcoin Cash are all showing significant potential for growth, each offering a unique value proposition. Whether it‚Äôs Qubetics‚Äô innovative approach to tokenizing real-world assets, TAO‚Äôs cutting-edge AI-driven blockchain, or BCH‚Äôs resilience in the face of volatility, these cryptos are primed for exponential growth. Qubetics, in particular, is set to be a game-changer in the blockchain and digital finance sectors. Its Real World Asset Tokenisation Marketplace addresses the pressing need for liquidity and accessibility in the asset market, making it an exciting project for future gains. As the presale continues to gather momentum, those seeking best cryptos for exponential returns should keep an eye on Qubetics and its groundbreaking solutions.

On the technicals, Solana is inching toward a death cross for the third time in its history. Alameda Unstakes 177,000 SOL Amid Distribution Spree According to an Arkham post , an Alameda Research-associated address has unstaked $23 million SOL, distributing the funds to several addresses. On-chain data indicates that the Alameda staking address received $22.9 million SOL following a staking address unlock. Upon receipt of the tokens, the funds were distributed to 37 addresses associated with FTX and Alameda. Cumulatively, the 37 recipient addresses hold $178.82 million SOL, sparking fears of a selloff. Typically, unstaking large amounts of SOL triggers selling pressure for Solana price. In the event of a sale, excess SOL floods the market and if demands fall to match supply, prices take a massive hit. A move to exchanges will confirm speculation of a selloff with similar moves historically triggering corrections for Solana price. At the start of March, Solana whales unstaked nearly $1 billion SOL as prices tumbled to multiple-month lows. Solana Price Marches Toward Death Cross Onchain indicators say Solana is approaching a death cross for the third time in its history. The death cross is a bearish signal, occurring when the 50-day moving average crosses below the 200-day moving average. Achieving a death cross could send Solana price to new lows with previous occurrences proving extremely bearish. The first death cross in 2022 saw prices fall by over 90%, exacerbated by FTX‚Äôs implosion. The second death cross in 2022 saw prices take a nose dive before staging a recovery during the ‚ÄúTrump pump.‚Äù Experts say projections for SOL to reach $200 are unlikely as it trades at a six-month low. At the moment, Solana price is trading at $126.53 down by nearly 15% over the last week. For now, traders are proceeding with caution with the biggest indicator being a steep drop in daily trading volume. Over the last 24 hours, trading volume has fallen by 22.71% to settle at $4.1 billion.

OKX Europe is making significant strides in the regulated digital asset space. The exchange has strategically acquired a MiFID II-licensed firm in Malta, signaling a bold move towards offering regulated crypto derivatives to its European users. This development underscores OKX‚Äôs commitment to compliance and expansion within the European market, but what does this mean for the future of crypto trading in the region? Let‚Äôs dive into the details. OKX Europe‚Äôs Strategic Acquisition: A Game Changer? OKX Europe‚Äôs recent acquisition of a MiFID II-licensed firm in Malta is more than just a business deal; it‚Äôs a strategic maneuver designed to solidify its position in the European cryptocurrency market. This move is specifically aimed at enabling OKX to offer regulated crypto derivatives to its European customer base. Why is this significant? Regulatory Compliance: Operating under a MiFID II license demonstrates OKX‚Äôs commitment to adhering to European regulatory standards. This is crucial for building trust and legitimacy in the eyes of both users and regulators. Expansion of Services: The acquisition paves the way for OKX Europe to broaden its service offerings beyond spot trading, venturing into the lucrative and complex world of crypto derivatives. Market Access: A MiFID II license provides a robust framework for operating within the European financial market, opening doors to a wider audience of institutional and retail investors. However, it‚Äôs important to note that while the acquisition is a major step, OKX still needs to secure final approval from the Malta Financial Services Authority (MFSA). This regulatory nod is essential before OKX can officially commence operations under the MiFID II license later this year. Decoding the MiFID II License: What Does It Mean? MiFID II, or the Markets in Financial Instruments Directive II, is a cornerstone of the European Union‚Äôs financial regulation. But what exactly does a MiFID II License entail, and why is it so valuable for a cryptocurrency exchange like OKX? Essentially, MiFID II is designed to: Increase Transparency: It aims to make financial markets more transparent by imposing stricter reporting requirements and trading rules. Enhance Investor Protection: A core objective is to protect investors by ensuring firms act in their clients‚Äô best interests and provide appropriate levels of information and safeguards. Promote Fair Competition: MiFID II seeks to foster fair and efficient markets by regulating trading venues and investment firms across the EU. For OKX Europe, holding a MiFID II license means operating under a well-established regulatory framework that is recognized and respected across Europe. This license is not just a piece of paper; it‚Äôs a testament to OKX‚Äôs commitment to operating at a high standard of regulatory compliance, which is particularly important when dealing with complex financial products like crypto derivatives . Why Malta? The Allure of a Crypto-Friendly Nation Malta has long been recognized as a progressive jurisdiction in the cryptocurrency and blockchain space. Why did OKX choose Malta for this strategic expansion? Malta offers several key advantages that make it an attractive location for crypto businesses: Pro-Innovation Regulatory Environment: Malta was one of the first EU member states to establish a comprehensive legal framework for blockchain and cryptocurrencies, earning it the moniker ‚ÄúBlockchain Island.‚Äù EU Membership: Being part of the European Union allows companies based in Malta to benefit from EU-wide market access and regulatory harmonization. Talent Pool: Malta has cultivated a growing ecosystem of professionals with expertise in blockchain, fintech, and regulatory compliance. Favorable Tax Regime: Malta offers a competitive tax system that can be advantageous for international businesses. By acquiring a firm in Malta, OKX Europe is strategically positioning itself within a jurisdiction that is both crypto-friendly and compliant with European standards. This move leverages Malta‚Äôs supportive environment to facilitate its expansion into regulated crypto derivatives offerings. The Future of Crypto Derivatives in Europe: What to Expect? OKX Europe‚Äôs move comes at a pivotal time for the European cryptocurrency market. With the upcoming Markets in Crypto Assets (MiCA) regulation, the landscape is rapidly evolving. How will this acquisition and the focus on regulatory approval impact the availability and accessibility of crypto derivatives in Europe? Here‚Äôs what we can anticipate: Aspect Potential Impact Increased Regulatory Clarity MiCA and national licenses like MiFID II will provide clearer guidelines for crypto firms, fostering a more stable and predictable operating environment. Enhanced Investor Confidence Regulation can boost investor confidence by providing a level of protection and oversight that is currently lacking in many parts of the crypto market. Growth of Institutional Participation Regulatory frameworks can encourage institutional investors to enter the crypto derivatives market, bringing in greater liquidity and maturity. Product Innovation As regulatory clarity increases, we may see more innovative and sophisticated crypto derivative products tailored to the European market. However, challenges remain. Navigating the complex web of European and national regulations, ensuring compliance, and educating users about the risks and complexities of crypto derivatives will be ongoing tasks for OKX and other players in the space. Navigating Regulatory Hurdles: The Path to Approval While the acquisition of a MiFID II-licensed firm is a significant achievement, the journey isn‚Äôt over yet for OKX Europe. Securing regulatory approval from the MFSA is the next crucial step. What does this process typically involve, and what are the potential hurdles? The MFSA approval process will likely involve: Due Diligence: The MFSA will conduct thorough due diligence on OKX Europe, assessing its financial stability, operational capabilities, and compliance frameworks. Compliance Checks: Rigorous checks will be carried out to ensure OKX‚Äôs operations align with MiFID II requirements and Maltese regulations. Risk Management Assessment: The MFSA will evaluate OKX‚Äôs risk management systems and controls, particularly in relation to the offering of crypto derivatives. Ongoing Supervision: Even after approval, OKX will be subject to ongoing supervision by the MFSA to ensure continued compliance. The successful completion of this regulatory approval process is paramount for OKX to realize its ambitions of offering regulated crypto derivatives in Europe. The industry will be watching closely to see how this progresses, as it could set a precedent for other exchanges seeking to expand their regulated offerings in the region. Conclusion: A Strategic Win for OKX and European Crypto? OKX Europe‚Äôs acquisition of a MiFID II-licensed firm in Malta is undoubtedly a strategic win for the exchange, positioning it favorably to tap into the growing European market for regulated crypto derivatives . This move, coupled with its earlier MiCA registration, signals a clear commitment to operating within the bounds of European regulation and providing a compliant platform for its users. While final regulatory approval is still pending, this development represents a significant step forward for OKX Europe and potentially for the broader adoption of regulated crypto derivatives in Europe. As the regulatory landscape continues to evolve, OKX‚Äôs proactive approach could pave the way for a more mature and accessible crypto market in the region.

The Bolivian media outlet Urgente reported that President Luis Arce‚Äôs cabinet has also given YPFB the go-ahead to purchase US dollars from domestic financial institutions, including the state-run bank Banco Uni√≥n. Bolivia: Crypto Move The Cabinet noted that YPFB was free to use USD or crypto to conduct fuel import-related deals with overseas vendors. YPFB engineers at a facility in Bolivia. (Source: YPFB/Facebook) The government issued a special decree permitting the firm to use crypto and USD specifically to buy ‚Äúcrude oil and diesel.‚Äù The firm can also use crypto to buy related products that can be used to refine gasoline. Arce‚Äôs crisis-hit government has been locked in a standoff with Bolivia‚Äôs Former President Evo Morales since last year. Clashes between groups loyal to Arce and those who support Morales have led to armed takeovers of military posts and road blockades. Arce‚Äôs government has also been best with problems in the Bolivian parliament, the Plurinational Legislative Assembly. La Paz says this has ‚Äúimpeded the entry of foreign currency‚Äù by ‚Äúblocking the approval of loans totaling over $1.667 billion.‚Äù This has left YPFB short of the foreign currency it needs to pay for fuel imports. In turn, this has led to a drop in supplies of both diesel and gasoline.

Experts think countries fighting sanctions regimes are now turning to crypto as a payments tool. The government of Iran approved the use of crypto for imports in 2022, with some in Moscow calling Tehran a ‚Äúpioneer‚Äù in crypto-powered trade. Venezuela has also used crypto in fossil fuel trade deals. This, at one stage, led to the Nicol√°s Maduro-led government reportedly amassing a huge ‚Äústash‚Äù of Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) coins.

Many believe that Russian oil firms have made extensive use of crypto. Moscow has also openly spoken about using crypto to bypass US, EU, and UK sanctions for both imports and exports. Last year, the Bolivian lawmaker Mariela Baldivieso said farmers in the country could soon start using crypto as a remittance tool .

Coinbase, one of the world‚Äôs leading cryptocurrency exchanges, has just dropped a bombshell announcement. Buckle up, because they‚Äôre listing Aethir (ATH)! This news, revealed on X, has sent ripples of excitement throughout the crypto community. Mark your calendars for March 13th at 9:00 a.m. (PT) ‚Äì that‚Äôs when the Coinbase listing ATH goes live. But what exactly is Aethir, and why is this listing such a big deal? Let‚Äôs dive into the details. What is Aethir and the Buzz Around ATH? Aethir is not just another cryptocurrency project; it‚Äôs a platform focused on something truly groundbreaking: decentralized GPU usage. In a world increasingly reliant on processing power for everything from AI to gaming, Aethir is stepping in to democratize access to GPUs. Imagine a future where GPU resources are readily available and distributed, rather than concentrated in the hands of a few. That‚Äôs the vision Aethir is working towards. The ATH token is the lifeblood of this ecosystem. Think of it as the fuel that powers the Aethir network. It serves as the primary medium of exchange within the Aethir ecosystem, facilitating transactions and incentivizing participation. As the platform grows, the utility of the ATH token is expected to increase, making this Coinbase listing ATH announcement even more significant. Why is the Coinbase Listing ATH a Game Changer? Coinbase listing ATH is more than just adding another token to a crypto exchange. It‚Äôs a validation and a massive leap forward for Aethir and the concept of decentralized GPUs. Here‚Äôs why this listing is generating so much excitement: Increased Visibility and Accessibility: Coinbase is a giant in the crypto world, known for its user-friendly platform and broad reach. Listing ATH on Coinbase instantly exposes Aethir to millions of potential users and investors who may not have been aware of the project before. This increased visibility is crucial for adoption and growth. Enhanced Liquidity: A listing on a major exchange like Coinbase typically leads to a significant boost in liquidity. This means it will be easier to buy and sell ATH tokens, making it more attractive for traders and investors. Higher liquidity can also contribute to price stability and reduce volatility. Credibility and Trust: Coinbase has a rigorous vetting process for listing new tokens. Their decision to list ATH signals a level of confidence in the project‚Äôs legitimacy, technology, and potential. This endorsement can significantly enhance Aethir‚Äôs credibility within the often skeptical crypto space. Mainstream Adoption of Decentralized GPUs: By listing ATH, Coinbase is indirectly promoting the concept of decentralized GPUs to a mainstream audience. This can accelerate the adoption of this innovative technology and pave the way for a more distributed and accessible computing future. Decentralized GPUs: Unlocking the Power of Distributed Computing The concept of decentralized GPUs might sound technical, but its implications are far-reaching. Here‚Äôs a simplified look at why decentralized GPUs are so important: Democratizing Access to Computing Power: Currently, access to high-performance GPUs is often limited and expensive. Decentralized GPU networks aim to break down these barriers, making powerful computing resources available to anyone, anywhere.

Security researchers have discovered over the last few months that the group has been sabotaging malicious npm packages that steal credentials, exfiltrate cryptocurrency wallet data, and create a persistent backdoor in development environments. It marks a major escalation in their years-long cyberwar, which has already witnessed some of the biggest crypto heists in history. According to a new investigation by the Socket Research Team , a branch of Lazarus Group has penetrated the npm repository, one of the most popular package managers for JavaScript developers. The hackers then used typosquatting techniques to publish malicious versions of popular npm packages, deceiving unsuspecting developers into downloading the programs. The packages include is-buffer-validator, yoojae-validator, event-handle-package, array-empty-validator, react-event-dependency, and auth-validator. When executed, the compromised packages install BeaverTail malware. This ‚Äúadvanced‚Äù tool can steal login credentials, search through browser files for saved passwords and dump files from cryptocurrency wallets, such as Solana and Exodus. Security researchers noted that the stolen data were sent to the hardcoded command-and-control (C2) server, a common modus operandi employed by the Lazarus Group to relay confidential data back to their actors. Its purpose is to steal and transmit compromised data without being detected, and it was particularly threatening in the world of developers building financial and blockchain applications, says Kirill Boychenko, a threat intelligence analyst at Socket Security. Lazarus launched an offensive against Bybit, stealing nearly $1.46 billion In addition to these supply chain attacks, Lazarus Group has also been tied to one of the biggest cryptocurrency thefts on record. Its first action is suspected to have occurred on February 21, 2025, when group-linked hackers breached Bybit, one of the world‚Äôs biggest crypto exchanges, making off with an estimated $1.46 billion in crypto assets. The attack was extremely sophisticated and was allegedly launched from a compromised device of a Safe{Wallet} employee, a Bybit technology partner. Hackers leveraged a vulnerability in the infrastructure of Bybit‚Äôs Ethereum wallet and altered smart contract logic to redirect funds to their wallets. Although Bybit addressed the problem immediately, a statement from CEO Ben Zhou revealed that 20% of the stolen money had already been laundered via mixing services and was untraceable. This latest series of attacks is part of North Korea‚Äôs broader effort to evade international sanctions against it by stealing and laundering cryptocurrency. According to a 2024 United Nations report, North Korean cybercriminals were responsible for over 35% of global cryptocurrency thefts over the past year, accumulating over $1 billion in stolen assets. Lazarus Group is not just a cybercrime syndicate but also a geopolitics threat since stolen money is reportedly directly funnelled into the nation‚Äôs nuclear weapons and ballistic missile programs. Such Lazarus Group attacks have also progressed over the years, from direct exchange hacks to supply chain attacks and even developer and software repository attacks. By adding backdoors to open-source platforms like npm, PyPI, and GitHub, the group expands its potential attack range to many systems, eliminating the need to hack directly into cryptocurrency exchanges. Security experts are calling for stricter protections for crypto developers Noting these growing risks, cyber specialists are pushing for stricter security for developers and crypto users and protection from hackers. One such best practice is verifying the realness of npm packages before installation because typosquatting continues to be one of the most common methods cyber criminals use. Socket AI Scanner also tracks anomalies in your software dependencies or npm audit, which informs you whether any compromised packages are in use and allows you to remove them from your application before they can do any real damage. The guide recommends that users and developers take the initiative to protect themselves by enabling multi-factor authentication (MFA) for exchange wallets, developer platforms like GitHub, and other accounts. Network monitoring is now regarded as the first line of defence as the compromised system will usually send messages back to an external command and control (C2) server, which then uploads the malicious updates on the infected computer. Blocking illegitimate outbound traffic can cut hackers‚Äô access to this stolen data. Bybit launches recovery bounty as crypto security battle heats up Following the Bybit hack, the exchange also initiated a Recovery Bounty Program, rewarding anyone who helps find the stolen assets. The program allows for rewards of up to 10% of the money recovered. At the same time, the larger crypto ecosystem is busy ramping up security practices and alerting developers to protect against the same practices that can lead down this threatening path. But as Lazarus Group‚Äôs tactics advance ever more quickly, network defenders say the war on crypto has only just begun. Cryptopolitan Academy: Tired of market swings?

41561678,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=691882,1741822557,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/41561678.jpeg,State-backed Bolivian energy firm YPFB turns to crypto amid painful dollar shortage,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/bolivian-energy-firm-ypfb-turns-to-crypto/,"The Bolivian state energy company, Yacimientos Petrol√≠feros Fiscales Bolivianos (YPFB) has announced plans to make energy imports into the country with cryptocurrency as there is a current shortage of dollars within the country. This shortage is due to the dwindling exports of natural gases over the years. Up until June 2024, Bolivia‚Äôs central bank, Banco Central de Bolivia had a ban placed on Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. At the time, the bank cited Bolivia‚Äôs struggling economy as the reason for the ban. It also stated that the ban would align the country with Latin American crypto regulations. The ban was lifted for a simpler reason ‚Äî the global acceptance of cryptocurrencies. Other Latin American countries such as El Salvador, Argentina, Brazil, and Mexico had adopted the use of cryptocurrencies before Bolivia jumped on the wagon. With its economy still struggling and the reduction in exports, the country is again turning to cryptocurrency as a way out. Cryptocurrency for energy According to Reuters , a spokesperson for the state-run energy firm YPFB revealed that a system to use cryptocurrency to purchase fuel imports has been put in place. The energy firm also said that it had received government approval to use digital assets to help meet demand. Despite the government‚Äôs approval, YPFB has not yet used digital currency to purchase energy imports, but it intends to do so, according to a government spokesperson. Bolivia is catching up to other countries within South America with its increased acceptance and adoption of cryptocurrency and digital assets. Countries such as El Salvador and Argentina are integrating digital assets into their financial systems. Argentina‚Äôs state-owned energy firm, YPF, ventured into crypto mining operations in 2022 and has been supplying power for mining activities while making plans to further expand its crypto mining operations. Brazil established a law regulating digital assets in December 2022, and it came into effect in June 2023. The aim of the regulation was to legalize crypto as a payment method. Bolivia fuel shortages Bolivia‚Äôs economy is largely dependent on its vast natural resources. The country‚Äôs primary export is natural gas, but it also exports gold, zinc, and silver among other commodities. Bolivia‚Äôs natural gas exports were valued at $2.05B in 2023 and while this might sound like an impressive amount, those figures are a whopping 31% less than the value of Bolivia‚Äôs natural gas exports from the previous year which was valued at approximately $2.97B. Following the descending trend, the value of natural gas exports from Bolivia in 2021 was also higher than that of 2022. The exports of natural gas from Bolivia are typically imported by Argentina and Brazil. Over the years, the country has been experiencing a significant decline in its exports of natural gas, and as a result, has witnessed a decrease in its foreign currency reserves. This shortage of dollars has rendered the country incapable of regular function as it uses the US dollar to import goods, fuel included. The lack of dollars led to a fuel crisis in the country, and now, long lines at gas stations and scattered protests are becoming a norm. Bolivia functioned as a net energy exporter due to its large reserves of gas. The country also utilized its natural resources domestically. However, with the diminishing production, it has become reliant on imports to meet the country‚Äôs energy consumption needs.

National regulatory bodies across the European Union deliberated on the issue during a meeting led by the European Securities and Markets Authority‚Äôs (ESMA) Digital Finance Standing Committee on March 6. OKX Faces Intense Scrutiny The focus of the inquiry is OKX‚Äôs Web3 service, which happens to be a decentralized finance (DeFi) platform and self-custodial wallet that facilitates access to multiple blockchains and exchanges. Reports indicate that hackers, allegedly tied to North Korea, funneled approximately $100 million in stolen cryptocurrency through this platform. Bloomberg report suggests that authorities are now assessing whether OKX‚Äôs Web3 service falls under the jurisdiction of the EU‚Äôs newly implemented Markets in Cryptoassets (MiCA) regulation, which aims to oversee digital asset providers and ensure compliance with financial security measures. Some regulators, particularly from Austria and Croatia, argued that OKX‚Äôs Web3 service should be subject to MiCA‚Äôs regulatory framework despite fully decentralized platforms being exempt under the rules that came into force in late 2024. A key point of discussion at the meeting was whether the platform‚Äôs integration into OKX‚Äôs main website and its connection to an OKX Singapore entity constituted grounds for enforcement under MiCA. A regulatory presentation at the meeting reportedly outlined how OKX‚Äôs user interface enables token swaps and wallet connections directly through its website, suggesting centralized oversight rather than a purely decentralized model. Additionally, officials raised concerns about potential violations of sanctions against North Korea, given the laundering activities linked to the attack. The outcome of this regulatory scrutiny could lead to penalties for the crypto and further discussions on the application of EU financial laws to similar platforms. OKX Responds OKX has firmly rejected claims, calling the Bloomberg report misleading. The exchange clarified that its Web3 wallet and swap features function similarly to those of other major crypto platforms, and serve as aggregators to improve user efficiency rather than facilitating illicit transactions. According to OKX, its immediate response to the Bybit breach included freezing related funds on its centralized exchange and introducing a new tool to detect and block hacker-linked addresses from accessing its decentralized exchange or wallet services. The company expressed disappointment over Bybit‚Äôs statements and argued that they contributed to misinformation by wrongly implying an investigation into OKX. It even went on to emphasize that regulatory scrutiny is not directed at its operations but rather stems from broader industry discussions on decentralized finance regulations. Additionally, OKX suggested that the real issue lies in Bybit‚Äôs security shortcomings, rather than any wrongdoing on its part. The exchange strongly refuted what it described as false claims that misrepresented its role in the aftermath of the cyberattack.

Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong has stated that more government institutions are showing interest in digital assets, with a growing number engaging in trading, custody, and blockchain applications. Coinbase CEO: US Bitcoin Reserve Sparks More Government Crypto Adoption In a recent post on X platform, Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong announced that the company now collaborates with 145 government entities in the United States and 29 internationally. The company provides services such as custody, trading, and blockchain infrastructure to these institutions. Cobase CEO Armstrong noted that the launch of the U.S. Strategic Bitcoin Reserve has accelerated interest from government bodies. More institutions are looking to integrate digital assets into their financial frameworks. The top crypto exchange has positioned itself as a primary partner for public-sector organizations seeking to engage with crypto securely. More so, just days ago, the exchange secured its registration with the Financial Intelligence Unit (FIU), marking a key step toward resuming operations in India . Coinbase‚Äôs return follows a period of regulatory adjustments in the country. India‚Äôs crypto market, with its growing adoption, presents an opportunity for the exchange‚Äôs expansion. Government Partnerships for Crypto Services Coinbase has built relationships with multiple government entities at the federal, state, and local levels. The company provides custody solutions, trading infrastructure, and blockchain integration services to these institutions. As a publicly traded company, Coinbase adheres to strict regulatory standards. The firm emphasizes compliance and security, which has contributed to its role as a trusted crypto partner for governments worldwide. Notably, Coinbase has safeguarded digital assets for over 13 years without experiencing a security breach. The company employs advanced encryption methods, multi-factor authentication, and physical security measures to protect digital holdings. Governments are not only interested in Bitcoin as a store of value but also in blockchain technology for operational improvements. Public institutions are exploring the use of blockchain for secure transactions, record-keeping, and financial management. Coinbase CEO revealed the Exchange offers, portfolio management, due diligence, and technical solutions to support government entities in their crypto adoption. Additionally, most recently, Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong shared that the top crypto exchange plans to accelerate its U.S. expansion by hiring 1,000 employees in 2025. This decision comes as regulatory clarity improves, allowing Coinbase to focus on growth rather than legal uncertainties.

This came as he revealed a critical technical indicator, which has turned bearish for the flagship crypto, although he noted that BTC bulls can still invalidate this current bearish setup. Bitcoin Price At Risk Of Further Crash As S&P Monthly LMACD Turns Bearish In an X post, Severino indicated that the Bitcoin price could crash further as the S&P 500 monthly LMACD has begun to cross bearish and the histogram has turned red. This development is significant as IntoTheBlock data shows that BTC and the stock market still have a strong positive price correlation. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Action Says Bottom Is In, Analyst Reveals What‚Äôs Coming The crypto analyst stated that BTC bulls can turn this bearish setup for the Bitcoin price in the next 20 days, as diverging would lead to a bullish setup instead. However, the Bulls‚Äô failure to turn this around for Bitcoin could lead to a massive decline for the flagship crypto, worse than it has already witnessed. Severino stated that a confirmation of this bearish setup at the end of the month could kick off a bear market or Black Swan type event similar to what happened when the last two crossovers occurred. It is worth mentioning that BTC has already crashed to as low as $76,000 recently, sparking concerns that the bear market might already be here. However, crypto experts such as BitMEX co-founder Arthur Hayes have suggested that the bull market is still well in play for the Bitcoin price. Hayes noted that BTC has corrected around 30% from its current all-time high (ATH), which he remarked is normal in a bull run. The BitMEX founder predicts that the flagship crypto will rebound once the US Federal Reserve begins to ease its monetary policies. BTC Still Looking Good Despite Recent Crash Crypto analyst Kevin Capital has suggested that the Bitcoin price still looks good despite the recent crash. In his latest market update, he stated that BTC remains the best-looking chart and that everything is going according to plan for the flagship crypto. The analyst predicts that Bitcoin could still come down and test the range between $70,000 and $75,000, which he claims would still be completely fine. Related Reading: Bitcoin 77% Correction To $25,000, Will History Repeat Itself Kevin Capital remarked that the Bitcoin price could remain afloat if it holds a key market structure and the 3-day MACD resets. He added that some decent macro data could help the flagship crypto stay above key support levels. The US CPI data will be released today, which could provide some relief for the market if it shows that inflation is slowing. The analyst is confident that one good inflation report and the FOMC can help turn the tides. At the time of writing, the Bitcoin price is trading at around $81,860, up over 2% in the last 24 hours, according to data from CoinMarketCap.

Data from Ethereum block explorer shows the MEV attack occurred on decentralized exchange Uniswap v3‚Äôs USDC-USDT liquidity pool, where $19.8 million worth of value is locked. Details of the sandwich attack transaction. Source: Etherscan The MEV bot front-ran the transaction by swapping all the USDC liquidity out of the Uniswap v3 USDC-USDT pool and then put it back in after the transaction was executed, according to founder of The DeFi Report Michael Nadeau. The attacker tipped Ethereum block builder ‚Äúbob-the-builder.eth‚Äù $200,000 from the $220,764 swap and profited $8,000 themselves, Nadeau said. DeFi researcher ‚ÄúDeFiac‚Äù speculates the same trader using different wallets has fallen victim to a total of six sandwich attacks, citing ‚Äúinternal tools.‚Äù They pointed out that all funds traveled from borrowing and lending protocol Aave before being deposited on Uniswap. Two of the wallets fell victim to an MEV bot sandwich attack on March 12 at around 9:00 am UTC.

Both transactors made the same swap in the Uniswap v3 liquidity pool as the trader who made the $220,762 transfer. Others speculate the trades could be attempts at money laundering . ‚ÄúIf you have NK illicit funds you could construct a very mev-able tx, then privately send it to a mev bot and have them arb it in a bundle,‚Äù said founder of crypto data dashboard DefiLlama, 0xngmi. ‚ÄúThat way you wash all the money with close to 0 losses.‚Äù Related: THORChain at crossroads: Decentralization clashes with illicit activity While initially criticizing Uniswap, Nadeau later acknowledged that the transactions didn‚Äôt come from Uniswap's front end, which has MEV protection and default slippage settings.

The Nasdaq Composite jumped by 1.2%, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell by 0.2%, extending its own three-day slide, according to data from CNBC. Futures for major indexes ticked up after the closing bell. S&P 500 futures rose 0.2%, Nasdaq 100 futures climbed by 0.2%, and Dow futures added 45 points, or 0.1%. In extended trading, Intel surged 10% after appointing Lip-Bu Tan as its new CEO, while Adobe dropped 4% after projecting weaker-than-expected earnings for its second fiscal quarter. Tech stocks drive market rebound, the Dow lags behind Tech stocks were the biggest winners. The technology sector gained 1.6%, leading the entire market as investors rushed to scoop up shares of companies that had been battered in recent sessions. Nvidia and Palantir Technologies were among the biggest gainers, helping the Nasdaq Composite outperform other indexes. But not every part of the market joined the rally. The Dow Jones Industrial Average struggled, slipping another 0.2% to mark its third straight decline. Investors avoided traditional blue-chip stocks, focusing instead on high-growth tech names. Meanwhile, the Consumer Price Index (CPI) report for February showed inflation cooling, with prices rising 0.2% from the previous month and 2.8% over the past year, which calmed some fears about the economy, but trade concerns kept investors on edge. The Federal Reserve‚Äôs next move remains uncertain. ‚ÄúWe still believe the next Fed rate move is lower, but it is hard to have high confidence with the impact of tariffs still uncertain,‚Äù said Scott Helfstein, head of investment strategy at Global X. Trump‚Äôs tariffs and inflation fears loom over markets Donald Trump‚Äôs new tariffs on steel and aluminum officially went into effect on Wednesday, adding 25% duties on steel imports and 10% on aluminum, regardless of the country of origin. That sent shockwaves through the global economy. In response, Canada fired back with a 25% retaliatory tariff on more than $20 billion worth of U.S. goods. Traders had already been expecting some kind of technical bounce after recent sell-offs, but concerns over Trump‚Äôs trade policies kept the rally in check. The S&P 500 briefly fell into correction territory on Tuesday, slipping 10% below its February record high. The Nasdaq Composite and S&P 500 are both down 3% for the week, while the Dow has dropped 3.4%, making this its worst week since March 2023. More economic reports are due Thursday, including the latest weekly jobless claims and the February producer price index (PPI), a key measure of wholesale inflation. Investors will also be watching earnings from Dollar General and Ulta Beauty to gauge consumer spending trends. Some investors are moving their money away from U.S. markets. ‚ÄúRather than an outright sell-off, what we‚Äôve seen is largely rotation,‚Äù said Michael Green, chief strategist at Simplify Asset Management. ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs been a combination of money rotating out of the United States and into Europe, Japan, and Canada. To a certain extent, that‚Äôs contributed to the weakness in the dollar.‚Äù Green also warned that inflation might not be as contained as some think. ‚ÄúThat likely puts additional pressure on forward inflation trends and offsets some of the benefits of a weaker economy,‚Äù he said. If inflation continues to slow, it could give the Federal Reserve room to cut interest rates if the economy weakens. Volatility traders profit as market swings intensify While most investors have taken losses in recent weeks, volatility traders are cashing in. Since February 18, the S&P 500 has dropped 8.4%, and the Nasdaq Composite has fallen 11.9%. That sharp downturn has sent the Cboe Volatility Index (VIX) soaring. The VIX, often called the ‚Äúfear gauge‚Äù, has spiked 52% over the past month as uncertainty rattles the stock market. ‚ÄúWe make money when markets are in dispossession,‚Äù said Kris Sidial, co-chief investment officer at Ambrus Group, a hedge fund specializing in volatility trading. ‚ÄúMany investors increased their exposure to stocks when Trump was elected, thinking the second term would be like the first. They‚Äôre now seeing they‚Äôre offsides and have to rebalance.‚Äù Sidial and other traders use options strategies to profit from market swings. Michael Nauss, a trader at StatsEdgeTrading, described one approach: ‚ÄúYou buy puts and calls for the same strike price at the same expiration date. It‚Äôs called bracketing and allows traders to make money in both directions.‚Äù Traders are also taking advantage of higher premiums in the options market. ‚ÄúPut buying is expensive right now as investors rush to protect their positions,‚Äù Nauss added. Options trading has exploded in popularity. Robinhood, a major trading platform, reported last week as its biggest week ever for options volume. With stock market uncertainty growing, more investors are turning to derivatives to hedge their bets or speculate on wild price swings. While most analysts still don‚Äôt expect a recession, the odds of an economic downturn have increased since last year. Alec Kersman, a senior executive at Pimco, noted at CNBC‚Äôs CONVERGE LIVE event in Singapore that the chances of a U.S. recession are now higher than in 2024. Meanwhile, Trump‚Äôs tariffs could reshape the global economy, pushing trade partners to find alternatives to U.S. imports. If the trend continues, the U.S. may no longer be the dominant force in global trade. Markets remain in flux, with investors trying to navigate the uncertainty. With the Federal Reserve, inflation, and trade policies all in play, traders are expecting more volatility in the weeks ahead. Cryptopolitan Academy: Tired of market swings?

The 270% increase in Dogecoin network active addresses fails to support its present $0.17 value because the currency decreased 9% since the previous week. The price decline of DOGE has prompted numerous investors who are DOGE millionaires to explore alternative lucrative opportunities. The emerging decentralized finance token Mutuum Finance (MUTM) continues to get noticed through its $3.1 million presale because it shows excellent potential to transform users‚Äô financial returns. Mutuum Finance (MUTM): A DeFi Powerhouse in the Making Mutuum Finance (MUTM) represents something far more than a regular token because it has built a decentralized lending platform with genuine financial value. MUTM functions differently than the speculative cryptocurrency Dogecoin because it enables users to both loan and borrow funds while generating passive revenue using its mtTokens system. User deposits within the MUTM platform are represented by mtTokens that earn sustained interest as the tokens accumulate value for holders. The successful presale shows that the project represents strong potential going forward. Wall Street investors seek rapid participation before the upcoming price jump to $0.025 in Phase 3 where $3.1 million dollars have already been raised. The value of early-phase participation exceeds 25% since early participants maintain their tokens until the following phase completes. The token‚Äôs upcoming listing value that buyers secured today will generate a 400% return on investment because it is priced at $0.06. DOGE Faces Significant Market Challenges Dogecoin faces current difficulties as part of the overall tumultuous behavior within the meme coin market. The token has not surpassed its important resistance zones even though network activity jumped 270% and whales brought in 1.7 billion DOGE during a 72-hour period. The analysis of $0.16 support shows that analysts believe the price may fall to $0.13 in case this area gives way. The speculative nature of DOGE along with its absence of useful applications makes it a dangerous investment option during the current market period. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) delivers a practical value model through its decentralized lending system linked to a buy-and-distribute process which provides sustained price consistency as well as expansion. Mutuum Finance Unique Features The presale structure of Mutuum Finance (MUTM) provides rewards for its initial purchasers. The present price of MUTM at $0.02 enables investors to acquire significant value as the anticipated launch price stands at $0.06. Research analysts see Mutuum Finance (MUTM) reaching $1.50 by 2025 which represents a 7,400 percent increase from its present market value. DogsCoin millionaires currently show strong interest in MUTM tokens because they present a new opportunity for portfolio expansion. As an overcollateralized lending system MUTM ensures stability through its P2P lending feature which offers flexible solutions to borrowers. Through its buy-and-distribute process MUTM maintains steady token demand that both raises prices and bestows market value upon long-term token holders. A Golden Opportunity for Early Investors In its fight to establish dominance Dogecoin is seeing Mutuum Finance (MUTM) take leadership in decentralised financial sector. Phase 3 approach of the presale is ending soon which means investors only have limited time to acquire MUTM tokens at $0.02. Present investors buy early because their holdings will proliferate predominantly when MUTM gains popularity before its stock trading begins on essential exchanges. The cryptocurrency market shows extreme rigors however it provides lucrative chances to early market participants. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) delivers a complete package of novel features and valuable functions along with substantial growth potentials that stand out in the market. The time to act is now. Dogecoin faces a vulnerable future as Mutuum Finance (MUTM) shows potential for strong expansion which is drawing experienced investors to act immediately. Secure MUTM tokens now to benefit from lifelong gains through the market. The next phase is just around the corner, and prices won‚Äôt stay this low for long.

41566531,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=710967,1741831239,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/newsbtc.png,XRP Faces Bearish MVRV Crossover‚ÄîPrice Plunge To Continue?,https://www.newsbtc.com/xrp-news/xrp-faces-bearish-mvrv-crossover-price-plunge/,"On-chain data shows the XRP Market Value to Realized Value (MVRV) Ratio has just gone through a crossover that may not be positive for the asset‚Äôs price. XRP MVRV Ratio Has Dropped Under Its 200-Day MA As pointed out by analyst Ali Martinez in a new post on X, the MVRV Ratio‚Äôs latest crossover may signal a macro trend shift for XRP. The ‚ÄúMVRV Ratio‚Äù refers to an on-chain indicator that keeps track of the ratio between a given asset‚Äôs market cap and its realized cap. Related Reading: Bitcoin Bear Market Is Below This Level, Analyst Reveals The realized cap is a capitalization model that calculates the cryptocurrency‚Äôs ‚Äòtrue‚Äô value by assuming that the real value of any token in circulation is the spot price at which it was last transacted on the network. The previous transaction price of any coin can be considered the value at which its investor purchased it, so the realized cap represents the total amount of capital that the asset‚Äôs holders as a whole spent to purchase their holdings. In contrast, the market cap just tells us what value the investors are holding in the present. Since the MVRV Ratio takes the ratio between these two metrics, it basically signifies the profit-loss status of the market as a whole. The indicator being greater than 1 suggests investors are holding more than they invested, while it being under the mark implies a dominance of underwater tokens. Now, here is the chart shared by the analyst that shows the trend in the XRP MVRV Ratio, as well as its 200-day moving average (MA), over the last few months: As displayed in the above graph, the XRP MVRV Ratio has witnessed a plunge recently as a result of the drawdown that the cryptocurrency‚Äôs price has gone through. Though, despite the price crash, the indicator‚Äôs value continues to be well above the 1 level, meaning that the investors of the asset are still largely in the green. That said, there is one important level that the metric has indeed dipped below due to the downtrend: the 200-day MA. Related Reading: Solana Falls Under Realized Price: Here‚Äôs What Happened Last Time The MVRV Ratio broke above the level in the last few months of 2024 and remained above it until this breakdown. From the chart, it‚Äôs apparent that the previous crossover proved to be a bullish signal for XRP. Now that the reverse crossover has occurred, the analyst has noted that another potential macro trend shift could be ahead for the cryptocurrency‚Äôs price. It only remains to be seen whether the asset will continue to decline in the coming days and confirm the pattern or not. XRP Price At the time of writing, XRP is floating around 2.23, up more than 5% over the last seven days.

While Elon Musk, Jeff Bezos, Mark Zuckerberg, Larry Page, Bill Gates, Larry Ellison, Bernard Arnault, and Michael Dell are seeing billions wiped from their portfolios, Warren is sitting on a $334 billion cash pile that is untouched by the stock market collapse. Warren has spent the past nine quarters selling stocks instead of buying, including massive exits from Apple, Bank of America, and Citigroup. The decision was confusing at first, but now, as Wall Street tanks and tech stocks crumble due to fears that president Donald Trump‚Äôs tariff policies and trade war threats would send the economy into a recession, Warren was clearly one step ahead‚Äîagain. Warren dumped Apple and banks before the collapse As per usual, Warren saw what others didn‚Äôt. While investors were still riding the highs of a Trump-driven market rally, he was cashing out. Apple had just topped, Wall Street was setting records, and everyone thought stocks would keep climbing, but Warren wasn‚Äôt convinced. He sold billions in Apple shares and cut his stakes in Bank of America and Citigroup right before Trump took office again. His cash reserves surged to $334 billion, making up one-third of Berkshire Hathaway‚Äôs portfolio . Warren Buffett with late best friend Charlie Munger, who was the vice chairman of Berkshire Hathaway. Source: Robyn Twomey/Redux/laif To put that into perspective, that‚Äôs more than the entire value of every single company on the FTSE 100 combined together. Then came the crash on Monday when the Nasdaq dropped by 4% in a single day, its biggest decline in three years. Tech stocks tumbled, and the investors who had doubled down on the AI boom got crushed, but oh not Warren. Wall Street panics, but Warren waits Warren has been in the game long enough to know when to bet big and when to hold back. His strategy is simple: ‚ÄúBe fearful when others are greedy and greedy when others are fearful,‚Äù he has said. In the 90s, when LTCM, a major hedge fund, collapsed, Warren tried to bail it out with a $250 million rescue offer. In the 2008 financial crisis, when Goldman Sachs was on the verge of collapse, Warren stepped in with $5 billion, securing a deal that earned him a $3 billion profit. Warren also partnered with 3G Capital to buy Kraft Heinz, a decision he justified with one word: ‚ÄúKetchup.‚Äù In 2017, Warren tried to acquire Unilever for $143 billion, but the company‚Äôs board shut him down. This time, though, he‚Äôs not looking to save anyone. While other investors are scrambling for cover, Warren is sitting back and waiting for better opportunities. His greatness is truly unfathomable. Berkshire‚Äôs next moves and Warren‚Äôs latest bets But Warren hasn‚Äôt completely walked away from stocks. In Q4 2024, he opened a position in Constellation Brands (STZ), the parent company of Corona beer, while dumping Ulta Beauty (ULTA) just a few quarters after buying it. Warren held onto Apple and Chevron after making major cuts earlier in the year. But he reduced more of his holdings in Bank of America, Nu Holdings, and Citigroup, showing that he‚Äôs still wary of the financial sector. And then there‚Äôs crypto. Warren has made it very clear that he hates crypto, but through Nu Holdings, a major crypto-friendly bank, he technically has exposure to it. The irony? Trump, the only pro-crypto president the U.S. has ever had, is back in office‚Äîbut Warren doesn‚Äôt like him either. Source: Warren Buffett Twitter/X One thing Warren isn‚Äôt doing? Buying back Berkshire Hathaway shares. Despite record earnings, Berkshire has halted stock buybacks for two straight quarters. Warren seems to believe there are better places to put his money, and right now, that doesn‚Äôt include his own company. Instead, he‚Äôs increasing his stake in five Japanese trading houses, a move he started nearly six years ago. He‚Äôs not saying how much he‚Äôll buy, but in his words, ‚ÄúOver time, you will likely see Berkshire‚Äôs ownership of all five increase somewhat.‚Äù Warren‚Äôs instincts have made him a key player in some of Wall Street‚Äôs biggest deals as well as the greatest investor of all time. The market is falling apart, but Warren? He‚Äôs just waiting. Cryptopolitan Academy: Coming Soon - A New Way to Earn Passive Income with DeFi in 2025.

Crypto-wide trading volume has been dropping since it peaked in February amid dip-buying opportunities. According to CoinGecko data , daily trading volume hit its highest level this year in early February when it reached $440 billion. It has since sunk by 63% to $163 billion on March 12. Market data firm CoinMarketCap has slightly lower figures but they show the same trend ‚Äî that volume peaked in 2025 in early March before falling back 52% to current levels. Analytics firm Santiment said on X on March 13 that this decline in volume suggests that trader enthusiasm for the asset class is diminishing. ‚ÄúWhen trading volume for major cryptocurrencies consistently drops, even during slight price recoveries, it typically points toward diminishing trader enthusiasm.‚Äù Santiment added that trader behavior ‚Äúindicates a mix of exhaustion, hopelessness, and capitulation‚Äù following further market capitalization declines over the past fortnight. Declining crypto trading volume. Source: Santiment Total market capitalization has declined almost 25% since the beginning of February, shrinking by $900 billion as the crypto market correction deepens. Those declines have accelerated over the past 10 days when markets have lost 15% as fears of a recession in the United States increased amid escalating global trade tensions . Santiment stated that traders are becoming cautious, suggesting they might not believe that the current upward price movements will last. ‚ÄúEssentially, reduced trading activity reflects uncertainty, as fewer traders are convinced that buying at current levels will yield profitable outcomes,‚Äù the analysts added. Weakening trading volume amid minor price bounces can serve as an ‚Äúearly warning sign of weakening market momentum,‚Äù Santiment reported, adding that without robust buying participation, price gains can quickly lose steam, ‚Äúas there simply isn‚Äôt enough underlying support to sustain the upward trend.‚Äù ‚ÄúThis leads to the possibility that any rebound could be temporary, with prices vulnerable to another downturn.‚Äù Related: Bitcoin high-entry buyers are driving sell pressure, price may ‚Äòfloor‚Äô at $70K However, shrinking volume during minor rebounds isn‚Äôt necessarily a direct bearish signal, it said, adding that volume is a metric that measures participation from both retail and institutional traders and it needs to start rising before prices do. ‚ÄúTo signal a healthier and more sustainable recovery, bulls generally will want to see both rising prices and rising volumes simultaneously.‚Äù Crypto market capitalization is currently around $2.8 trillion, which is where it was this time last year before seven months of consolidation followed. Meanwhile, the Crypto Fear & Greed Index remains in ‚Äúfear‚Äù territory, below 50, where it has been since Feb. 21.

Among the top meme coins for exponential returns, Arctic Pablo Coin ($APC) and Dogwifhat ($WIF) have emerged as notable contenders. While Dogwifhat has experienced significant volatility, Arctic Pablo Coin presents a fresh opportunity with its innovative presale structure and compelling narrative. Arctic Pablo Coin: A New Frontier in Meme Coins Enter Arctic Pablo Coin ($APC), a meme coin that intertwines storytelling with investment opportunities. The narrative follows Arctic Pablo, an intrepid explorer navigating icy terrains and uncovering mystical $APC coins. This imaginative storyline engages potential investors and sets the stage for a unique presale experience. Unlike traditional presales divided into stages, Arctic Pablo Coin‚Äôs presale is conceptualized as a journey through various locations, each representing a presale phase. As Arctic Pablo traverses these enchanted realms, the price of $APC increases at each location, irrespective of the number of tokens sold. This innovative approach creates a sense of urgency and adventure, encouraging investors to join the expedition early to maximize potential returns. Currently, Arctic Pablo has arrived at Frosty Falls, the 14th location in this journey, with $APC priced at $0.000074. The presale has raised over $1.86 million, reflecting strong community interest and investor confidence. With a launch price set at $0.008, early investors have the potential to realize returns exceeding 10,694.59% from the Frosty Falls phase to the listing price. Arctic Pablo Coin employs a deflationary mechanism to enhance scarcity and value by permanently burning unsold tokens weekly during the presale. Tokens remaining after the presale will also be burned, fostering a deflationary environment that benefits investors by potentially increasing the value of the remaining tokens. Beyond the presale, Arctic Pablo Coin offers a staking program with an impressive 66% Annual Percentage Yield (APY). Investors can stake their $APC tokens and enjoy generous rewards, promoting long-term engagement and network security. All staked coins will be vested for two months after the launch, ensuring a stable and committed staking environment. It stands among the Top New Meme Coins for Exponential Returns . Dogwifhat: The Rise and Volatility of a Meme Coin Dogwifhat burst onto the crypto scene with the charm of its canine mascot donning a whimsical hat, quickly capturing the attention of meme coin enthusiasts. Built on the Solana blockchain, $WIF capitalized on the popularity of dog-themed cryptocurrencies, drawing parallels to predecessors like Dogecoin and Shiba Inu. Its community-driven approach and viral appeal contributed to a meteoric rise, with $WIF reaching an all-time high of $4.83 in March 2024, delivering substantial gains to early investors. However, the volatile nature of meme coins became evident as Dogwifhat‚Äôs price experienced significant fluctuations. As of March 12, 2025, $WIF is trading at approximately $0.436, reflecting a sharp decline from its peak. This downturn has been attributed to factors such as market corrections and challenges within the broader crypto ecosystem. Despite these setbacks, Dogwifhat maintains a dedicated community and continues to be a topic of interest among meme coin investors. Conclusion: Seize the Opportunity with Arctic Pablo Coin Based on our research and market trends, Arctic Pablo Coin stands out among the top new meme coins for exponential returns. Its innovative presale structure, compelling narrative, and strategic tokenomics create a unique investment opportunity. As Arctic Pablo‚Äôs journey progresses, each new location signifies not just a phase in the presale but also an invitation for investors to embark on this adventure.

The token surged from less than $10 on January 18th to a high of $74.59 on January 20th before quickly surrendering some gains within hours. Although the token remained competitive days after the president‚Äôs inauguration, by trading above $30, it quickly faded under pressure.

While most traders lost billions of dollars during its crash, a sizeable number of early investors cashed in for huge profits. Early Investors Cash Out Before Listing In Major Exchanges According to 10x Research, most early investors cashed in just before major exchanges listed the coin, as its value moved past $60 and briefly hit $70. The coin‚Äôs rapid surge in price was welcomed by everyone, with the early investors getting the best seats in the house. After its quick rise, TRUMP suffered a massive drop.

With the TRUMP token, the value significantly dropped within the week. By looking at the bigger picture, TRUMP token shed more than 80% since its peak last January. And on-chain data suggests that early investors quickly liquidated their positions, with retail and small traders used as pawns. Solana Chain Takes A Hit The Solana ecosystem is one of the biggest losers in the token‚Äôs crash. Aside from TRUMP, a few other Solana-based tokens faced selling pressure, including Raydium‚Äôs RAY token, which dropped by 60% in the last month. Even Solana‚Äôs native token, SOL, dropped by over 40% over the same period. The drop in value for SOL-based tokens suggests that the interest in meme coins or speculative tokens is waning.

Data shared by the blockchain data platform Santiment in a March 12 X post shows Tether‚Äôs ( USDT ) onchain activity has been on the rise, peaking with over 143,000 wallets making transfers on March 11, the highest in six months. ‚ÄúWhen USDT & other stablecoin activity spikes during price drops, traders are preparing to buy. Added buy pressure aids in crypto prices recovering,‚Äù Santiment said. Onchain activity for Tethers USDT has spiked, reaching a sixth-month high. Source: Santiment It comes as Bitcoin ( BTC ) dropped to a four-month low of $76,700 on March 11 , as the wider crypto market shed even more of the gains made post-US election amid macroeconomic uncertainty and an escalating tariff war. Speaking to Cointelegraph, Vincent Liu, chief investment officer at Kronos Research, said traders often accumulate Tether during dips to position themselves for buying opportunities, adding buy pressure that can help crypto prices recover. He speculates the uptick in USDT wallet activity likely reflects traders capitalizing on recent market volatility . ‚ÄúPossible causes include broader economic uncertainties, crypto-specific events like regulatory developments or post-election sentiment shifts, and Tether‚Äôs role as a stable haven, making it an ideal holding for investors preparing to deploy capital strategically,‚Äù Liu said. Related: Bitcoin, crypto ‚Äòdip buy hype‚Äô is now at its highest level in 7 months Liu says the surge in USDT activity is a bullish indicator, suggesting significant buying power on the sidelines, but the crypto market‚Äôs recovery will likely depend on factors like macroeconomic conditions, regulatory clarity, and investor confidence. ‚ÄúHowever, with the inflation rate easing to 2.8% in February, lower than expected in recent CPI data, this could reduce pressure on crypto prices and signal a more favorable environment,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúAdditionally, the upcoming Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) on March 18th may provide further indications on interest rates and monetary policy, potentially influencing market development and recovery,‚Äù Liu added. A key Bitcoin and crypto sentiment tracker, the Crypto Fear & Greed Index, hit its lowest score in over two years on Feb. 26 as it slipped deeper into ‚ÄúExtreme Fear,‚Äù reaching a score of 10. Crypto sentiment has staged a recovery since, but the index has still registered a score of 45 on March 13, still in fear territory.

While blockchain networks like Ethereum ( ETH ) have made significant strides in their adoption, they still face challenges surrounding these core aspects. Enter ZKPs (zero-knowledge proofs) ‚Äì a cryptographic breakthrough that is quickly becoming a game-changer in the blockchain world. In this article, we will explore how ZKPs are improving blockchain ecosystems by offering privacy-preserving features, enhancing scalability and enabling new use cases across industries. Understanding ZKPs At its core, a ZKP is a cryptographic protocol that allows one party to prove to another that a statement is true without revealing any additional information about the statement itself. In the context of blockchain, ZKPs can be used to verify transactions or other data on a network while keeping sensitive information private. For instance, a user could prove that they have enough funds to complete a transaction on a blockchain without disclosing the actual amount in their wallet or the details of the transaction. This concept of privacy ‚Äì coupled with the ability to verify data without exposing it ‚Äì is what makes ZKPs such a powerful tool for blockchain scalability and security. There are two primary types of ZKPs in the blockchain space. ZK-SNARKs (zero-knowledge succinct non-interactive argument of knowledge) ‚Äì A powerful cryptographic technique that enables fast, non-interactive proofs. They are particularly useful for applications requiring scalability, such as Ethereum‚Äôs ZK-rollups. ZK-STARKs (zero-knowledge scalable transparent argument of knowledge) ‚Äì These offer stronger security guarantees and are designed to be more scalable, as they don‚Äôt require a trusted setup, unlike ZK-SNARKs. ZKPs in action ‚Äì b lockchain privacy and security As blockchain adoption grows, privacy concerns have become one of the most pressing issues for users and regulators alike. ZKPs offer an elegant solution to this problem. By allowing users to prove the validity of transactions without revealing any sensitive data, ZKPs help maintain privacy while still ensuring that the transaction is valid. A good example of ZKPs in action is Zcash ( ZEC ), a privacy-focused cryptocurrency that leverages ZK-SNARKs to allow private transactions. Zcash users can send funds without revealing the transaction amounts or addresses involved, making it one of the most secure and privacy-preserving blockchains in the crypto space. In addition to privacy, ZKPs provide an extra layer of security. By ensuring that data is only validated through cryptographic proofs, they significantly reduce the risk of fraudulent or malicious activity on the network. For enterprises and individuals looking to use blockchain technology for confidential applications, this is a huge advantage. Scalability ‚Äì h ow ZKPs are enhancing blockchain networks While privacy and security are crucial, scalability remains a critical bottleneck for blockchain networks. As DApps (decentralized applications) and transactions grow in volume, traditional blockchain networks ‚Äì especially those using PoW (Proof-of-Work) ‚Äì struggle to keep up with demand due to network congestion and high fees. This is where ZK-rollups ‚Äì a layer-two scaling solution based on ZKPs ‚Äì come into play. ZK-rollups aggregate large numbers of transactions into a single proof, allowing the main chain to process them more efficiently. Since only a single proof needs to be posted on-chain, the scalability of the entire network improves dramatically, resulting in lower fees and faster transaction speeds. Ethereum, for example, has integrated ZK-rollups as part of its broader scalability solutions through the Ethereum 2.0 upgrade. Platforms like Loopring and zkSync have already begun utilizing ZK-rollups, significantly improving transaction throughput while maintaining the security of the Ethereum network. The real-world adoption of ZKPs The potential of ZKPs extends beyond just privacy and scalability. Several industry leaders and blockchain projects are already integrating ZKPs to solve real-world problems. Polygon ‚Äì One of the most prominent layer-two solutions for Ethereum, Polygon is working on integrating ZK-rollups into its ecosystem to further improve scalability and reduce costs for DeFi users. StarkWare ‚Äì By utilizing ZK-STARKs, StarkWare is enhancing scalability solutions for DApps and enterprise solutions. Optimism ‚Äì While Optimism focuses on optimistic rollups, there is increasing exploration of how ZKPs can work in conjunction with optimistic rollups to improve overall system efficiency. As these examples show, ZKPs are not just theoretical ‚Äì they are actively being used to address blockchain‚Äôs most pressing challenges. ZKPs ‚Äì The future of blockchain privacy, scalability and innovation The continued development and adoption of ZKPs will play a pivotal role in shaping the future of blockchain technology. As more blockchain networks adopt ZKPs, we can expect to see increased privacy protections, reduced network congestion and greater scalability. This will unlock new opportunities for DeFi (decentralized finance), gaming and enterprise applications. Moreover, the ability to preserve privacy while maintaining full transparency will likely become a standard expectation in blockchain protocols. ZKPs are not only advancing the usability of blockchain networks but also paving the way for a future where blockchain is used for a wide range of applications ‚Äì from secure voting systems and confidential data sharing to scalable financial services. Conclusion ZKPs are fast becoming a cornerstone of blockchain innovation. With their ability to enhance privacy, security and scalability, ZKPs will enable the next wave of growth and adoption for blockchain technology. As ZKPs continue to evolve, we are likely to see a transformation in the way blockchain networks operate ‚Äì ushering in a more private, efficient and secure decentralized future. For developers, investors and blockchain enthusiasts, understanding ZKPs and their applications will be key to staying ahead in the rapidly advancing world of crypto innovation.

According to the economic latest data released on Mar. 12, February‚Äôs Consumer Price Index rose 2.8%, below the 2.9% forecast. Core CPI, which excludes food and energy, dropped to 3.1%, slightly better than the expected 3.2%. Markets responded by increasing bets on Federal Reserve rate cuts. Traders now price in a 31.4% chance of a cut in May, up from just 9% last month. The probability of three cuts by year-end jumped to 32.5%, while expectations for four cuts surged from 1% to 21%. Bitcoin ( BTC ) briefly surpassed $84,000 before falling back to $83,000, wiping off the majority of its post-CPI gains, despite the softer inflation data. Equities were unable to sustain early gains, and other financial markets also suffered. Analysts point to ongoing trade tensions as a key factor limiting risk appetite. Canada recently responded to U.S. steel and aluminum tariffs with $21 billion in tariffs on U.S. exports. The European Union then imposed additional tariffs on American goods valued at $28 billion. There is growing concern that rising trade disputes may raise inflationary pressures and complicate the Federal Reserve‚Äôs decision-making.

Market uncertainty remains high, with investors closely watching developments in both monetary policy and global trade. On-chain data, meanwhile, indicates that cryptocurrency traders are losing confidence. Crypto-wide trading activity has been declining since its peak in late February, according to Santiment.

According to data from Dune Analytics, 701 out of the 1327 active Solana ( SOL ) validators have voted. 1.2% have abstained, 17.2% are against the proposal, and 37.5% are in favor. If SIMD-228 were approved, it would drastically cut staking rewards, reducing the amount of fresh SOL tokens entering circulation. There have been some concerns about how this would affect the network‚Äôs decentralization, even though it might lessen selling pressure. Currently, Solana‚Äôs inflation models depend on striking a balance between transaction fee burning and staking rewards. More fees are burnt during periods of heavy network traffic, which helps to counter inflation. However as transaction costs have decreased, fewer tokens are being removed from circulation. Staking incentives keep adding fresh SOL supply at a 6.8% inflation rate, which may drive down its price. SIMD-228 would lower staking rewards, reducing supply, and possibly increasing the value of SOL. However, smaller validators with low or no commission rates would find it difficult to remain profitable and might even be forced out. If enough validators leave, the decentralization of the network may weaken, which raises questions about its long-term viability. Before choosing SIMD-228, Solana developers looked at a number of options, including ones with fixed-rate adjustments. Meanwhile, Solana‚Äôs market performance has been poor in the past few weeks. As of Mar. 13, SOL is trading at $126, more than 50% down its peak of $293 in January. According to DefiLlama data , decentralized finance activity has decreased, as seen by the network‚Äôs total value locked falling from $12 billion in January to $7 billion. Due to low network usage especially as memecoin trading cools off, monthly fees have also dropped significantly, from $250 million in January to $89 million in February. Supply pressure may be reduced if SIMD-228 is approved, but its success relies on the expanding network demand. Reducing inflation by itself might not be enough to drive a strong recovery in the absence of more users and activity,",News|decentralization|layer 1|Solana,EN,0,0,SOL|TRADING|MARKET,"{'name': 'crypto.news', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/73/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",crypto_news,2025-03-13 03:56:49

Ledger Donjon acknowledged Trezor has made several security advancements of late but found cryptographic operations could still be performed on the microcontroller of Trezor‚Äôs Safe 3 and 5 models, which could make them ‚Äúvulnerable to more advanced attacks.‚Äù Fortunately, Trezor has since addressed the vulnerabilities found, Ledger‚Äôs chief technology officer Charles Guillemet said in a March 12 X post. ‚ÄúWe believe that making the ecosystem more secure helps everyone, and is critical as we push towards broader adoption of crypto and digital assets,‚Äù Guillemet added. Source: Charles Guillemet Trezor had already implemented ‚ÄúSecure Elements‚Äù ‚Äî chips designed to protect the user's PIN code and cryptographic secrets ‚Äî as some of Trezor‚Äôs devices could be tampered with by modifying the software running on it, potentially allowing threat actors to steal user funds. The Secure Elements feature ‚Äúeffectively thwarts any inexpensive hardware attack, in particular voltage glitching,‚Äù Ledger said in a March 12 post. ‚Äú[This] gives users confidence that their funds are safe even if their device gets misplaced or stolen.‚Äù However, Ledger found another potential attack vector stemmed from the microcontroller, the other main part of Trezor‚Äôs two-chip design for its Safe 3 and 5 models. Trezor implemented a firmware integrity check to detect modified software, but Ledger was able to demonstrate that an attacker could still bypass this security check. This issue has since been resolved by Trezor ‚Äî though neither Ledger nor Trezor have explained how. Cointelegraph reached out to Trezor but didn‚Äôt receive an immediate response. Trezor‚Äôs microcontroller in the Trezor Safe 3 model. Source: Ledger Trezor confirmed on X that user funds remain safe and that no action is required.

That‚Äôs why we have already implemented a multi-layer defense against supply chain attacks and always advise our users to purchase from official sources.‚Äù Ledger isn‚Äôt immune to security vulnerabilities either. In December 2023, a hacker committed a security breach into Ledger‚Äôs connector library and stole $484,000 worth of crypto assets.

However, in the shorter time frame, signs of potential reversal are emerging. Over the past 24 hours, Bitcoin has seen a slight recovery, with its price rising to $81,647. This shift has led analysts to closely examine whale activity and exchange trends to determine whether the correction phase may be nearing an end. Related Reading: Bitcoin‚Äôs SOPR Nears Critical Level‚ÄîIs a Deeper Correction Ahead? Binance‚Äôs Whale Activity and Its Impact on Bitcoin‚Äôs Trend One of CryptoQuant‚Äôs analysts, Darkfost, has identified a key trend in Binance‚Äôs whale activity that could impact Bitcoin‚Äôs price movements. Binance, as the largest cryptocurrency exchange by volume, plays a significant role in market liquidity, making its whale activity an important metric to monitor. Darkfost‚Äôs analysis of the Bitcoin Exchange Whale Ratio on Binance suggests that whales are reducing their selling pressure, which could signal a shift in market sentiment. The exchange whale ratio measures the proportion of the top 10 inflows to total inflows on an exchange. When this ratio is elevated, it indicates increased whale selling activity, often contributing to short-term price corrections or market consolidation phases. Conversely, a declining whale ratio suggests less selling pressure, which could help stabilize Bitcoin‚Äôs price or even contribute to a rebound. According to Darkfost, the declining whale ratio on Binance may indicate that the selling pressure from large Bitcoin holders is easing. Historically, a decrease in whale selling activity has preceded bullish market movements, making this metric a key indicator for traders. If this trend persists, Bitcoin could see reduced downward momentum, potentially setting the stage for price stabilization or recovery. Binance‚Äôs Dominance in Spot and Futures Trading In a separate analysis, CryptoQuant analyst Crazzyblockk has highlighted Binance‚Äôs continued dominance in both spot and futures markets. Binance holds the largest market share in crypto trading, reinforcing its position as a key player in price discovery and liquidity. Currently, Binance accounts for a 45.5% share of the USDT futures market, significantly ahead of other trading platforms. Crazzyblockk wrote: This highlights Binance as the preferred choice for derivatives trading, offering the best liquidity and execution. Related Reading: Bitcoin To Bottom Around $70,000?

33767162,[object Object],1741842047,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/33767162.jpeg,"Dogecoin Whales Accumulate Amid Price Crash, Analyst Reveals Catalyst That Could Drive DOGE To $0.5",https://bitcoinist.com/dogecoin-whales-accumulation/,"Crypto analyst Lumen has revealed a significant accumulation trend among Dogecoin whales , which provides a bullish outlook for the DOGE price. The analyst also mentioned what could drive the meme coin‚Äôs price to $0.5, marking a bullish reversal for Dogecoin. Dogecoin Whales Accumulate As Price Eyes Rally To $0.5 In an X post , Lumen revealed that Dogecoin whales accumulated 1.7 billion DOGE ($298 million) in 72 hours, which he noted signals bullish sentiment ahead of a potential Dogecoin ETF approval . These whales‚Äô accumulation has come amid a massive price crash for Dogecoin, which has dropped 20% in a week, falling from around $0.22 to as low as $0.16. Lumen then went on to give a price projection for the foremost meme coin. He stated that if DOGE reclaims $0.2 before the ETFs approval, there is a possibility that Dogecoin could rally to $0.5 because of the liquidity of ETFs. He added that the world‚Äôs richest man, Elon Musk , could also resume bull posting about DOGE as he had done before. It is worth mentioning that the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) recently postponed the approval process for Grayscale‚Äôs Dogecoin ETF , suggesting that the pending DOGE ETF applications are unlikely to be approved anytime soon. However, despite this development, crypto analyst Ali Martinez has predicted that DOGE could soon rebound. The analyst stated that investor sentiment around Dogecoin is at its most negative in over a year. Martinez added that historically, extreme fear has set the stage for major reversals. In line with this, he remarked that this could be a prime opportunity to be a contrarian. Current State For DOGE Crypto analyst Kevin Capital provided insights into Dogecoin‚Äôs current price action. He stated that DOGE has had a back test of the macro 0.5 Fibonacci level. It has also back-tested macro trend lines, including the 200-week Simple Moving Average (SMA) and Exponential Moving Average (EMA). Meanwhile, the meme coin‚Äôs 3-day Relative Strength Index (RSI) is at historical lows. The analyst stated that if the Bitcoin price holds up and macroeconomic data and monetary policy adjust, then this might be the last opportunity to buy DOGE relatively cheaply. He added that a lot of factors are at play and there is a lot of work to do but the risk reward at this level is ‚Äúsuperb‚Äù given the circumstances. Crypto analyst Trader Tardigrade also provided a bullish outlook for Dogecoin. He stated that DOGE is forming a 5-wave Ascending Broadening Wedge and is approaching a breakout on the 4-hour chart. The analyst added that after a confirmed RSI bullish divergence, DOGE bounced back to the descending line of the wedge, indicating that a reversal may be imminent. At the time of writing, the DOGE price is trading at around $0.16, up over 2% in the last 24 hours, according to data from CoinMarketCap.",Altcoin News|Ali Martinez|broadening wedge|Coinmarketcap|Doge|DOGE news|doge price|dogecoin|Dogecoin ETFs|Dogecoin news|dogecoin price|dogeusd|dogeusdt|Elon Musk|EMA|Exponential Moving Average|Fibonacci Level|Grayscale|Kevin Capital|Lumen|meme coin|relative strength index|RSI Bullish Divergence|SEC|Simple Moving Average|SMA|Trader Tardigrade,EN,0,0,INJ|ETH|ASIA|ALTCOIN|HNT|MARKET|SHIB|BNB|EXCHANGE|BTC|REGULATION|TRADING|OTHER|DOGE|SOL|BLOCKCHAIN|XRP|TON|BUSINESS|FIAT|BONK|PYUSD|COMMODITY|ADA|ZRX|MINING|FTT|DOT|USDT|RESEARCH|FORKS|IMX|ICP|TRX|TECHNOLOGY|ARB|WLD|SPONSORED|RAY|SUI|PEPE|WALLET|UNI|XMR|LINK|NEAR|SEI|MATIC|ARKM|USDC|LTC|LUNA|AIRDROP|BTG|MX|TOKEN SALE|BSV|FLOKI|TOKEN LISTING AND DELISTING|BITTENSOR|HBAR|CRO|WIF|ZEC|MEME|MOG|APE|JUP|AAVE|ONDO|XTZ|BGB|LUNC|XLM|APT|ZK|MANA|AR|AGX|FET|AXS|ADMINISTRATIVE EVENTS|XDC|BCH|MNT|FIL|AVAX|LDO|SSV|ETHFI|ETC|RUNE|FDUSD,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-03-13 05:00:47

A significant announcement just dropped from one of the biggest names in the crypto exchange world. Coinbase, a leading platform for buying, selling, and managing digital currencies, has declared it will be ending support for three specific tokens ‚Äì FLOKI (FLOKI), Turbo (TURBO), and Gigachad (GIGA) ‚Äì for its New York-based users. This news, delivered via a concise update on X, has sent ripples through the crypto community, raising questions about regulatory pressures and the future availability of certain digital assets in specific regions. Let‚Äôs dive into the details of this urgent development and unpack what it means for you. Why is Coinbase Delisting Tokens in New York? Coinbase‚Äôs decision to halt support for FLOKI, TURBO, and GIGA for New York users boils down to their commitment to maintaining high listing standards and adhering to regulatory frameworks. In their announcement, Coinbase explicitly stated that they regularly monitor the digital assets listed on their platform to ensure they continue to meet their stringent listing criteria . While the specifics behind why these particular tokens no longer meet these criteria for New York users weren‚Äôt detailed, it‚Äôs highly likely to be linked to the evolving landscape of crypto regulations , especially within the state of New York. New York is known for having some of the strictest regulatory environments for cryptocurrencies in the United States. The state‚Äôs Department of Financial Services (NYDFS) operates under a framework that requires virtual currency businesses to obtain a ‚ÄòBitLicense‚Äô to operate within the state. This license is notoriously difficult to acquire and maintain, demanding rigorous compliance and reporting standards. It‚Äôs plausible that FLOKI, TURBO, and GIGA, or the way they are structured or traded, might not align with the NYDFS‚Äôs current requirements, leading Coinbase to preemptively discontinue support to remain compliant. Here‚Äôs a quick breakdown of the key factors likely contributing to Coinbase‚Äôs decision: Stringent New York Regulations: New York‚Äôs BitLicense and regulatory scrutiny are among the toughest in the US, requiring exchanges to be extremely cautious about the assets they offer. Ongoing Asset Monitoring: Coinbase actively reviews listed assets to ensure they continuously meet their internal standards and legal requirements. Proactive Compliance: Delisting tokens might be a proactive step by Coinbase to avoid potential regulatory conflicts and maintain its operational license in New York. Risk Mitigation: Certain tokens might be deemed as carrying higher regulatory or compliance risks in New York, prompting exchanges to remove them. Impact of Crypto Regulations on Exchanges and Users The Coinbase delisting incident serves as a stark reminder of the significant impact crypto regulations have on both cryptocurrency exchanges and their users. Regulatory uncertainty and varying compliance standards across different jurisdictions create a complex operating environment for exchanges. This can lead to: Limited Asset Availability: Users in highly regulated regions like New York may have access to a smaller selection of cryptocurrencies compared to users in less regulated areas. Increased Compliance Costs: Exchanges face higher operational costs in complying with diverse and evolving regulations, which can sometimes be passed on to users through fees or limited services. Market Fragmentation: Differing regulatory approaches can fragment the cryptocurrency market, creating regional discrepancies in asset availability and trading rules. Potential for Delistings: As regulations tighten or become clearer, exchanges might need to delist certain tokens to maintain compliance, disrupting users who hold those assets. For users in New York specifically, this situation highlights the importance of understanding the regulatory landscape of their state and how it affects their cryptocurrency activities. It also underscores the need to stay informed about exchange policies and potential changes in asset support. What Happens to Your FLOKI, TURBO, and GIGA on Coinbase? If you are a Coinbase user in New York holding FLOKI, TURBO, or GIGA, it‚Äôs crucial to understand what this delisting means for you and what actions you need to take. Here‚Äôs a clear timeline and actionable steps: Date & Time Action Details April 14, 2 PM ET Trading Discontinued Coinbase will cease trading for FLOKI, TURBO, and GIGA for New York users. You will no longer be able to buy or sell these tokens on Coinbase if you are in New York. After April 14, 2 PM ET Withdrawal Only You will still be able to withdraw your FLOKI, TURBO, and GIGA tokens from Coinbase to an external wallet that supports these assets. Recommended Action Plan Your Next Steps If you hold these tokens on Coinbase and are in New York, decide whether to withdraw them to a personal wallet or sell them before the delisting date if possible (depending on trading availability before April 14, 2 PM ET). Actionable Insights for New York Users: Check Your Portfolio: Immediately review if you hold any FLOKI, TURBO, or GIGA on your Coinbase account. Plan for Withdrawal: If you wish to keep holding these tokens, ensure you have a compatible external wallet and understand the withdrawal process on Coinbase. Consider Selling (If Possible): Depending on market conditions and your investment strategy, you might consider selling these tokens before the trading halt, if trading is still available leading up to April 14th. Stay Informed: Keep an eye on Coinbase‚Äôs official communication channels for any further updates or instructions. Navigating Crypto Regulations and Exchange Delistings The situation with Coinbase delisting tokens in New York underscores a broader trend in the cryptocurrency space: the increasing influence of regulatory oversight. As the industry matures, regulatory bodies worldwide are stepping up their efforts to provide frameworks for digital assets. While these regulations aim to protect investors and ensure market integrity, they also bring challenges for exchanges and users alike. For cryptocurrency users, navigating this evolving landscape requires: Due Diligence: Research and understand the regulatory environment in your jurisdiction and how it impacts your crypto activities. Choosing Compliant Exchanges: Opt for exchanges that demonstrate a strong commitment to regulatory compliance, even if it means slightly fewer asset choices. Diversification of Platforms: Consider using multiple exchanges or decentralized platforms to mitigate risks associated with regional restrictions or delistings on a single platform. Staying Updated: Continuously monitor regulatory news and exchange announcements to adapt your strategies proactively. Conclusion: Staying Ahead in a Regulated Crypto World Coinbase‚Äôs decision to discontinue support for FLOKI, TURBO, and GIGA in New York is a significant event that highlights the growing intersection of crypto regulations and exchange operations. For users in New York , it‚Äôs a call to action to understand the implications and take necessary steps to manage their holdings. More broadly, it‚Äôs a signal to the entire crypto community about the increasing importance of regulatory compliance and the need to navigate the digital asset space with awareness and adaptability. As the cryptocurrency landscape continues to evolve, staying informed and proactive will be key to thriving in this dynamic and increasingly regulated environment.

The Ethereum price remains accumulated within a narrow range, hinting at the possibility of an excess price compression. As a result, the bulls are unable to exert pressure, as it could fade quickly with the bears possessing a significant dominance. Therefore, the ETH price could be stuck in a bearish well, but from a wider perspective, the token has laid a bear trap, which could result in a 200% upswing in the next 3 to 6 months. Will ETH Price Reach $5000? The latest pullback in the ETH price has compelled the token to lose one of its pivotal supports that it has held since July 2022. After the drop, the bearish activity reduced without an attempt to drag the price lower close to $1500. This suggests the bulls remain vigilant and are preventing excess price drain. Moreover, the historical price pattern suggests the ongoing consolidation has happened before, which has triggered a 175% rise to form a new ATH at $4,870. With similar trading conditions, the ETH price is believed to rise and form a new ATH slightly above $5000, but the current market dynamics display a diverse price action. The historical price action of Ethereum suggests the price is very close to a complete bearish exhaustion phase. The weekly RSI is about to hit the lower threshold, which has happened after the price marked ATH in 2018 and 2021. The drop in RSI came in time with the rise in the bearish activity, leading the token towards the bottom of the descending trend. Currently, the ETH price seems to be an inch away from marking the bottoms, which could be close to $1500 as RSI remains at 33, and a drop below 20 could trigger a strong rebound. Therefore, the Ethereum price could maintain a continued descending trend and test the local support at $1580. Here the bulls are expected to trigger a rebound and initiate a strong ascending trend towards a new ATH, probably above $5000.",Price Analysis|Ethereum,EN,0,0,TRADING|ETH|MARKET,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-03-13 05:15:05

But with hundreds of projects launching every month, which ones are actually worth holding for the long haul? One coin that‚Äôs got serious long-term potential is BTFD Coin, a rapidly growing meme project that‚Äôs already raised over $6.31 million in presale and has a massive 3,650% ROI potential on the horizon. With its $0.006 target price making waves among analysts, it‚Äôs quickly becoming a major talking point in the crypto community. Alongside BTFD, Floki Inu, Brett, and Peanut the Squirrel are also grabbing investor attention. Let‚Äôs dive into why these are the best cryptos to hold long term before they explode even further. BTFD Coin: The Bulls Squad Is Gearing Up for a Massive Breakout If there‚Äôs one meme coin making waves in presale, it‚Äôs BTFD Coin . This community-driven powerhouse has already pulled in over $6.31 million, with more than 71 billion tokens sold and a loyal army of 11,300+ holders joining its Bulls Squad. The hype around BTFD isn‚Äôt slowing down, and for good reason‚Äîit‚Äôs being hailed as one of the best cryptos to hold long term, with analysts predicting explosive growth post-launch. What‚Äôs driving the FOMO? Analysts forecast a 3,650% ROI, thanks to BTFD‚Äôs projected $0.006 moon price after listing. Right now, the presale is still open at just $0.00016, but this price won‚Äôt last much longer. With each presale stage, the entry price climbs, making the window for early investors tighter by the day. The best time to secure BTFD at its lowest available price is right now before the current presale phase ends. A $10,000 investment in Stage 14 at $0.00016 would secure 62,500,000 BTFD tokens. Once BTFD hits its expected $0.0006 listing price, that investment jumps to $37,500. If BTFD reaches its moon price of $0.006, that same $10,000 turns into an eye-watering $375,000. And that‚Äôs before even factoring in BTFD‚Äôs 90% APY staking, which lets holders earn passive income simply by holding onto their tokens. To buy BTFD Coin at the presale price, investors need to set up MetaMask or Trust Wallet, load it with BNB, ETH, or USDT, and head to the BTFD presale page to complete their purchase before the next price increase. Why did this coin make it to this list?

41573457,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=139742,1741842934,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,DeriW Testnet Launch Sets New Standards in Decentralized Derivatives Trading,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/deriw-testnet-launch-sets-new-standards-in-decentralized-derivatives-trading/,"HONG KONG, March 13, 2025 /PRNewswire/ ‚Äî DeriW , the world‚Äôs first zero-gas-fee decentralized perpetual exchange operated by CoinW, has officially launched its public testnet, marking a pivotal step toward a new era of DeFi derivatives trading. This testnet isn‚Äôt a generic trial run ‚Äì it‚Äôs a full-featured preview of DeriW‚Äôs high-performance, user-centric platform, designed to demonstrate concrete improvements in usability, speed, and security. Early users and developers can now experience lightning-fast trades, up to 100x leverage, and robust security measures in a realistic environment as DeriW prepares to challenge industry incumbents. A Closer Look at the Testnet: Usability, Performance & Security DeriW‚Äôs testnet is engineered to feel like a production-ready exchange. Usability is key: traders can quickly connect their self-custody wallets and begin trading cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum with up to 100x leverage and a low 0.02% transaction fee. The platform offers multiple order types (market, limit, take-profit, stop-loss) and a diverse selection of tokens, from major assets to emerging projects. With its zero gas fee model, DeriW eliminates blockchain transaction costs, enabling rapid order placement and frictionless trading‚Äîcomparable to centralized exchanges. On the performance front, the DeriW testnet showcases the platform‚Äôs cutting-edge infrastructure. Built on the Arbitrum Orbit Layer 3 network (DeriW Chain), it leverages optimistic rollup technology and a custom WASM/Geth-based architecture. In practical terms, this translates to extremely high throughput and low latency. With a capacity of up to 80,000 transactions per second, testnet traders can execute orders smoothly with minimal latency, ensuring the platform stays responsive even during intense trading activity. Security measures are woven deeply into the testnet‚Äôs design, reflecting DeriW‚Äôs priority on protecting users. By building on Arbitrum‚Äôs L3, DeriW inherits Ethereum‚Äôs battle-tested security properties and decentralization while adding its own enhancements. All trades and collateral remain on-chain under users‚Äô self-custody, eliminating the custodial risks found in centralized exchanges. To further harden the platform, DeriW launched a comprehensive bug bounty program in tandem with the testnet. Security researchers and users are incentivized with bounties ranging from 100 to 100,000 $DER tokens for identifying vulnerabilities. Additionally, the testnet operates with a closed-fund liquidity mechanism and an automatic risk recalibration system that ensure stability even under extreme market conditions. These concrete measures give testnet participants confidence that the platform‚Äôs performance comes without compromising safety. How DeriW Stacks Up In an increasingly competitive DeFi derivatives arena, DeriW‚Äôs testnet is already demonstrating unique advantages over other leading platforms‚Äô test networks: Gas Fees & Trading Costs: DeriW distinguishes itself with its zero gas fee model. Every trade on DeriW‚Äôs testnet is executed without on-chain transaction fees, which is a stark contrast to many competitors. DeriW‚Äôs approach of truly on-chain, gas-free trading gives it an edge in user experience ‚Äì traders get the convenience of a CEX-like feel without sacrificing on-chain transparency. Performance Throughput: When it comes to raw speed, DeriW sets a high bar, delivering up to ~80,000 TPS‚Äîexceptional among decentralized exchanges. In comparison, some newer standalone-chain DEXs offer around 10,000 TPS‚Äîbetter than legacy Ethereum-based platforms but only an eighth of DeriW‚Äôs capability. This firmly places DeriW among elite, next-generation exchanges that support high-frequency trading at scale. Notably, DeriW achieves this impressive throughput while remaining fully EVM-compatible and secured by Ethereum, powered by the Arbitrum Orbit framework‚Äîa key differentiator validated by real user conditions on its testnet. Leverage and Trading Features: High leverage is a hallmark of derivative exchanges, and DeriW doesn‚Äôt disappoint. It offers up to 100x leverage on major trading pairs, which is higher than most decentralized competitors. By providing 100x, DeriW is catering to a segment of traders who seek higher risk-reward profiles, similar to offerings on some centralized futures exchanges. Importantly, DeriW couples this with advanced order types (stop-loss, take-profit, etc.) on the testnet, ensuring traders have tools to manage the risk that comes with high leverage. This combination of flexibility and control is critical ‚Äì and DeriW is showing that even in a testnet environment, users can practice sophisticated trading strategies that rival those on established platforms. Liquidity Model & Price Execution: Perhaps the most innovative aspect differentiating DeriW is its Pendulum AMM liquidity pool. Unlike traditional order books or static AMMs with oracles, DeriW‚Äôs pool dynamically adjusts liquidity based on traders‚Äô positions. This ‚Äúpendulum‚Äù approach optimizes asset utilization in real-time, supporting volumes beyond initial capital, reducing slippage, and providing deeper liquidity. While orderbook-based DEXs rely on market makers‚Äîvulnerable to slippage during volatility‚ÄîDeriW‚Äôs closed-fund model and automatic risk recalibration ensure solvency and stability, combining order-book depth with AMM efficiency. Security and Decentralization: All leading DeFi derivatives platforms prioritize security but use different approaches. Some rely on decentralized validators, others utilize their own consensus mechanisms with federated validators, and another inherits security from Arbitrum Layer 2. DeriW leverages Ethereum‚Äôs robust security via Arbitrum‚Äôs rollup, enhanced by its unique UBPK (Unstolen Browser Private Key) mechanism that ensures private keys remain securely stored within user browsers. Benchmarks and Performance Metrics in Context Thanks to Arbitrum Orbit‚Äôs efficient consensus and block production, DeriW‚Äôs block time is expected to be on the order of a second or less, which is similar to other DEXs 0.2s block time advantage. Achieving near-instant finality is crucial for traders who might otherwise worry about timing and MEV (Maximal Extractable Value) issues. Although detailed latency stats are still being gathered, the user experience goal is clear : make on-chain trading on DeriW feel as immediate as trading on a centralized platform. Another important metric is uptime and reliability during the test. The DeriW team is closely monitoring system uptime and recovery from any crashes or network issues. A robust exchange must handle network spikes, degraded conditions, or attacks without downtime. By publishing these performance metrics and comparing them with industry standards, DeriW intends to demonstrate transparently where it stands. So far, the absence of gas fees and high throughput capacity on testnet have enabled continuous trading even when simulating thousands of concurrent users ‚Äì something that might clog less scalable testnets. The platform is also tracking how its automatic risk controls (like the pendulum mechanism) perform quantitatively: e.g., maintaining targeted liquidity levels, keeping slippage near zero, and ensuring the funding rates and PnL (profit and loss) for liquidity providers stay within expected bounds. These technical benchmarks, once validated on testnet, will serve as proof points that DeriW can handle real-world volumes and stress when it goes live. Expected Outcomes & Next Steps Before Mainnet Launch The testnet phase is not just a demo for DeriW ‚Äì it‚Äôs a critical period for learning and refining. The main goals include collecting user feedback on the trading interface and features, uncovering any bugs or security vulnerabilities, and optimizing the platform‚Äôs performance under realistic conditions. DeriW is actively analyzing user interactions with its new liquidity model (including preferred leverage levels, popular trading pairs, and responses to zero fees) to refine fee structures and risk management. Incentive initiatives, such as the Supernova event, serve both as promotional tools and practical stress tests to ensure the platform performs reliably under high trading volume. Feedback collected through community channels will directly guide improvements, prioritizing user-identified issues in ongoing development sprints. By Q2 2025, DeriW plans to transition from testnet to mainnet alongside the $DER Token Generation Event (TGE), officially launching its economic and governance models. Prior to mainnet launch, the team will thoroughly fine-tune smart contracts, bolster infrastructure, and enhance the user interface based on insights gained from testnet users. The roadmap beyond mainnet is ambitious: by Q3 2025, DeriW plans to introduce a professional-grade API for algorithmic traders and support custom trading pairs. By Q4 2025, the goal is to cultivate a global trading community and further improve the user experience through community-driven enhancements‚Äîall built upon the foundation established during the testnet. Engaging the Community and Conclusion DeriW actively keeps the community engaged and informed with regular testnet updates, transparent performance metrics, and ongoing social media interaction. Early testnet adopters gain not only rewards but also valuable firsthand experience, positioning them advantageously for the mainnet launch. Backed by the seasoned CoinW exchange group, the meticulous approach to this testnet demonstrates readiness for prime time. DeriW‚Äôs testnet isn‚Äôt just another generic launch‚Äîit‚Äôs a bold demonstration of innovation, combining proven DeFi strengths with fresh enhancements. By benchmarking against industry leaders, DeriW signals its ambition to lead in decentralized trading. The coming months will be critical, but current progress suggests DeriW is well-positioned to convert testnet success into a transformative mainnet launch. Users can stay tuned as DeriW moves from testnet to mainnet, carrying forward the insights and confidence gained during this trial by fire. About DeriW DeriW is the first zero-gas-fee decentralized perpetual contract exchange, blending Ethereum‚Äôs security with Layer 3 scalability to deliver CEX-like efficiency in a decentralized framework. Operated by CoinW‚Äôs seasoned fintech team, it redefines trading with 80,000 TPS throughput, ensuring speed, transparency, and trustless execution.

Have you been feeling the tension in the air? Well, there‚Äôs a glimmer of hope on the horizon! The widely-watched Crypto Fear & Greed Index is flashing a less fearful signal, indicating a potential change in investor sentiment. Let‚Äôs dive into what this means for the crypto world and what you should be watching. Decoding the Crypto Fear and Greed Index: What‚Äôs Behind the Numbers? The Crypto Fear and Greed Index , a valuable tool provided by Alternative.me, isn‚Äôt just a random number generator. It‚Äôs a carefully calculated metric designed to gauge the prevailing emotions in the cryptocurrency market. Think of it as a mood ring for crypto! As of March 13th, the index climbed to 45, a significant 11-point leap from the previous day. This jump is noteworthy, but it‚Äôs crucial to understand what this number actually represents. The index operates on a scale from 0 to 100, with: 0 ‚Äì 24: Extreme Fear ‚Äì This zone suggests investors are extremely worried, potentially leading to panic selling and market bottoms. 25 ‚Äì 49: Fear ‚Äì Fear still dominates, indicating caution and uncertainty among traders. 50 ‚Äì 74: Greed ‚Äì Greed starts to creep in, with investors becoming more optimistic and potentially driving prices up. 75 ‚Äì 100: Extreme Greed ‚Äì This zone signals excessive optimism, often associated with market tops and potential bubbles. Currently at 45, the index remains in the ‚ÄúFear‚Äù zone. While still indicating overall fear, the significant increase suggests a lessening of extreme negativity and a move towards a more neutral market sentiment . What Factors Drive the Crypto Fear & Greed Index? The Crypto Fear and Greed Index isn‚Äôt based on guesswork. It‚Äôs a composite index, meaning it takes into account a range of data points to paint a holistic picture of market emotions. Here‚Äôs a breakdown of the factors influencing the index: Volatility (25%): Measures the rapidness and magnitude of price changes in the crypto market. High volatility often breeds fear. Market Momentum/Volume (25%): Examines trading volume and market momentum compared to recent averages. Strong momentum can indicate growing confidence. Social Media (15%): Analyzes sentiment and discussions across social media platforms to gauge public perception of the crypto market. Surveys (15%): Periodically conducts crypto surveys to directly measure investor sentiment and expectations. Bitcoin Dominance (10%): Tracks Bitcoin‚Äôs share of the total crypto market cap. Fluctuations can reflect risk appetite. Google Trends (10%): Analyzes Google search queries related to Bitcoin and crypto to understand general interest and curiosity. By combining these diverse factors, the index provides a nuanced view of the collective crypto sentiment . Why Does Improved Market Sentiment Matter? A shift in market sentiment , as indicated by the rising Fear & Greed Index, is crucial for several reasons: Market Stability: Reduced fear can lead to less volatile price swings and a more stable trading environment. Investor Confidence: Improved sentiment can encourage sidelined investors to re-enter the market, injecting new capital. Sustainable Growth: Growth driven by optimism rather than panic buying is generally considered more sustainable in the long run. Altcoin Performance: Often, when Bitcoin‚Äôs sentiment improves, altcoins tend to follow, potentially leading to broader market gains. However, it‚Äôs essential to remember that the index is just one tool. It‚Äôs not a crystal ball predicting future prices. It‚Äôs more like a weather vane, showing which way the wind of market emotion is currently blowing. A reading of 45, while improved, still suggests caution is warranted. Bitcoin Fear and Greed Index: Is Bitcoin Leading the Charge? While the article refers to the general Crypto Fear and Greed Index , it‚Äôs worth noting that there are also Bitcoin-specific Fear and Greed Indices available. Since Bitcoin is the dominant cryptocurrency, its sentiment heavily influences the overall market. Therefore, tracking the Bitcoin Fear and Greed Index specifically can offer even deeper insights into market movements. A rise in the general index often correlates with improved sentiment surrounding Bitcoin, and vice-versa. Actionable Insights: What Should Crypto Investors Do? So, what should you take away from this improved crypto market analysis ? Don‚Äôt Get Carried Away: While the increase is positive, the index is still in ‚ÄúFear.‚Äù Remain cautious and avoid impulsive decisions based solely on this indicator. Do Your Own Research (DYOR): The Fear & Greed Index is one data point. Combine it with fundamental analysis, technical analysis, and news monitoring for a well-rounded view. Consider DCA: If you believe in the long-term potential of crypto, a gradual approach like Dollar-Cost Averaging (DCA) can be a prudent strategy, regardless of short-term sentiment fluctuations. Monitor the Index: Keep an eye on the Fear & Greed Index trends. Significant shifts can signal potential market turning points. Conclusion: A Glimmer of Hope or a False Dawn? The 11-point rise in the Crypto Fear and Greed Index is undoubtedly a positive development. It suggests that the pervasive fear that may have gripped the crypto market is beginning to ease. Whether this is the start of a sustained recovery or a temporary reprieve remains to be seen. However, it‚Äôs a clear signal that crypto sentiment is shifting, and astute investors should pay close attention. By understanding the nuances of the Fear & Greed Index and incorporating it into a broader analysis, you can navigate the crypto market with greater awareness and make more informed decisions.

The large-cap altcoin, with a fully diluted valuation of about $224 billion and a 24-hour average trading volume of $25 billion, has dropped more than 54 percent since December 2024. Ethereum Whales Cash Out The Ethereum network has experienced a huge cash outflow in the past few weeks amid leadership change from the Ethereum Foundation . The U.S. spot Ether ETFs have recorded a net cash outflow of nearly $200 million in the past three weeks. Interestingly, even BlackRock‚Äôs ETHA has been bleeding, whereby it recorded a net cash outflow of $11 million on Tuesday. According to on-chain data analytics from Coinglass, the Bitcoin miner reserves have been declining exponentially in the past years to hover about 1.92 million. Meanwhile, the overall supply of Ether on centralized exchanges increased by about 81,397 ETH units in the past 24 hours to about 15.01 million coins. Heavy Liquidation of ETH Whale at Hyperliquid Exchange Earlier on Wednesday, an Ether whale opened a long position of 175,179 ETH, worth about $335.6 million, with 50x leverage on the Hyperliquid trading platform. According to on-chain data , the whale investor actively closed 14,945 ETH positions, worth about $28.7 million. As a result, the whale investors left 160,234 ETH, worth around $306.8 million, to be liquidated, hence making a profit of $1.86M, which caused Hyperliquidity Provider(HLP) to lose $4 million in the past 24 hours. The notable loss on Hyperliquid raised alarm over the impact of high leverage causing liquidity drain. Furthermore, the entrance of a couple of similar traders could easily drain the liquidity for Hyperliquid pools. In response, Hyperliquid announced the reduction of Bitcoin and Ether leverage from 50x to 40x and 25x respectively. Regarding commentary and questions on the 0xf3f4 user's ETH long: To be clear: There was no protocol exploit or hack. This user had unrealized PNL, withdrew, which lowered their margin, and was liquidated. They ended with ~$1.8M in PNL. HLP lost ~$4M over the past 24h.

41574229,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=139696,1741843504,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Groundbreaking Bitcoin Bill: Senator Lummis Champions Strategic Reserve in US Congress,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/lummis-bitcoin-bill-strategic-reserve/,"Hold onto your hats, crypto enthusiasts! A potentially seismic shift is brewing in the U.S. political landscape, and it involves none other than Bitcoin. Wyoming Senator Cynthia Lummis, a known Bitcoin advocate, has just dropped a bombshell ‚Äì a bill aimed at establishing a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve for the United States. This isn‚Äôt just another crypto discussion; it‚Äôs a concrete proposal lodged right on the official Congress website, signaling a serious move towards integrating Bitcoin into the nation‚Äôs financial strategy. Let‚Äôs dive into the details of this fascinating development and explore what it could mean for the future of Bitcoin and the U.S. economy. What is Senator Lummis‚Äô Bold Bitcoin Bill Proposing? At its core, the bill introduced by Senator Cynthia Lummis is about more than just buying Bitcoin. It‚Äôs about strategically managing digital assets within the government framework. The central idea revolves around creating a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve , much like the nation maintains reserves of other critical assets. According to the details available on the Congress website and a press release from Senator Lummis‚Äô office dated March 11, the bill has a few key objectives: Transparency in Government Bitcoin Holdings: The bill emphasizes the need for clear and transparent management of any Bitcoin acquired by the U.S. government. This is crucial for accountability and public trust, especially in the nascent and often misunderstood world of cryptocurrency. Cost Efficiency Leveraging Federal Reserve Resources: A notable aspect is the intention to utilize resources from the Federal Reserve System to manage this Strategic Bitcoin Reserve . This approach aims to minimize additional costs and integrate Bitcoin management into existing financial infrastructure. Significant Bitcoin Acquisition: Perhaps the most eye-catching element is the proposal to implement a program to purchase 1 million units of Bitcoin. Senator Lummis‚Äô press release specifies that this acquisition would be spread out over a defined period to reach approximately 5% of the total Bitcoin supply. This is a substantial amount and would position the U.S. government as a significant holder of Bitcoin. In essence, this Bitcoin bill is a comprehensive approach to not just own Bitcoin, but to strategically incorporate it into the national financial framework with an eye on transparency and fiscal responsibility. Why a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve? Unpacking the Potential Benefits Why would the U.S. government consider establishing a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve ? The rationale likely stems from a mix of strategic foresight and recognizing the evolving financial landscape. Here are some potential benefits: Future-Proofing National Assets: Bitcoin, despite its volatility, is increasingly seen as a digital gold and a hedge against inflation by many. Holding a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve could be viewed as a way to diversify national assets and prepare for a future where digital currencies play a more prominent role in the global economy. Technological Leadership: Embracing Bitcoin could position the U.S. as a leader in the digital asset space. It sends a powerful signal globally about the nation‚Äôs willingness to innovate and adapt to technological advancements in finance. Potential Financial Gains: While not guaranteed, Bitcoin‚Äôs historical price appreciation suggests that a significant holding could lead to substantial financial gains for the government over the long term. This could offset costs and potentially generate revenue. National Security Implications: In a world where digital assets are becoming increasingly relevant, having a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve could also be seen as a matter of national security. It provides a foothold in this emerging asset class and ensures the U.S. is not left behind as other nations explore digital currencies. Senator Lummis, a vocal proponent of Bitcoin, likely sees this Bitcoin bill as a crucial step towards embracing the future of finance and ensuring the U.S. remains competitive and resilient in the digital age. Challenges and Considerations: Navigating the Road Ahead While the potential benefits of a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve are compelling, the path forward is not without its challenges and considerations: Challenge Description Market Volatility: Bitcoin‚Äôs price is notoriously volatile. A significant investment could be subject to substantial fluctuations, raising concerns about risk management and potential losses of public funds. Regulatory Uncertainty: The regulatory landscape for cryptocurrencies in the U.S. is still evolving. Clarity and consistent regulations are needed to effectively manage and oversee a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve . Operational Complexity: Managing a large Bitcoin reserve securely and efficiently requires specialized expertise and infrastructure. The Federal Reserve would need to develop or acquire these capabilities. Public Perception and Political Will: Convincing the public and garnering political support for investing in Bitcoin, especially given its volatility and association with speculation, could be an uphill battle. Security Risks: Custody and security of a large Bitcoin reserve are paramount. Safeguarding against theft, hacking, and loss requires robust security protocols and infrastructure. Addressing these challenges will be crucial for the successful implementation of the Bitcoin bill and the establishment of a truly effective Strategic Bitcoin Reserve . Examples from Around the Globe: Are Other Nations Considering Bitcoin Reserves? The idea of a national Strategic Bitcoin Reserve might seem novel to some, but the concept of nations embracing Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies is gaining traction globally. While no nation has yet officially declared a ‚ÄòStrategic Bitcoin Reserve‚Äô in the exact same terms as Senator Lummis‚Äô bill, several countries are taking significant steps in the Bitcoin and cryptocurrency space: El Salvador: Perhaps the most prominent example is El Salvador, which adopted Bitcoin as legal tender in 2021 and has been actively accumulating Bitcoin for its national reserves. While their approach differs, it showcases a nation-state directly incorporating Bitcoin into its financial strategy. Central African Republic: Following El Salvador, the Central African Republic also adopted Bitcoin as legal tender, signaling a growing interest in digital currencies among nations, particularly in regions seeking alternative financial systems. Switzerland and Crypto-Friendly Regions: While not building explicit Bitcoin reserves, Switzerland and certain regions within other countries have adopted highly crypto-friendly regulations and are becoming hubs for crypto innovation. This indirectly strengthens the ecosystem and validates the asset class. Growing Institutional Adoption: Globally, we are seeing increasing institutional adoption of Bitcoin by corporations and investment funds. This trend indicates a growing acceptance of Bitcoin as a legitimate asset and a store of value, potentially paving the way for more nations to consider similar strategic moves. These examples, while varied, demonstrate a global trend of exploring and integrating Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies into national and institutional frameworks. Senator Lummis‚Äô Bitcoin bill could position the U.S. at the forefront of this evolving landscape. Actionable Insights: What Does This Mean for You and the Crypto Market? So, what are the actionable takeaways from this groundbreaking Bitcoin bill and the proposal for a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve ? Increased Legitimacy for Bitcoin: The introduction of this bill by a U.S. Senator on the official Congress website significantly enhances the legitimacy of Bitcoin as an asset class. It signals that Bitcoin is being taken seriously at the highest levels of government. Potential Positive Market Impact: If the bill progresses and the U.S. government begins acquiring Bitcoin, it could create significant buying pressure in the market, potentially driving up prices. The proposed purchase of 1 million Bitcoin units is a substantial amount that could have a noticeable impact. Watch Regulatory Developments: Keep a close eye on the regulatory discussions and developments surrounding this bill. The way the U.S. government approaches regulating and managing Bitcoin will have far-reaching implications for the entire crypto industry. Long-Term Investment Signal: For long-term crypto investors, this bill could be seen as a positive signal. It suggests that despite short-term volatility, the long-term trajectory of Bitcoin and digital assets is towards greater adoption and integration into the mainstream financial system. Ultimately, Senator Lummis‚Äô Bitcoin bill is more than just a piece of legislation; it‚Äôs a statement. It reflects a growing recognition of Bitcoin‚Äôs potential and the need for governments to engage with and strategically incorporate digital assets into their financial planning. Conclusion: A Revolutionary Step or a Distant Dream? Senator Cynthia Lummis‚Äô Bitcoin bill proposing a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve is undoubtedly a significant development in the ongoing saga of cryptocurrency adoption. Whether it will become law remains to be seen, but its very existence signals a paradigm shift in how policymakers are beginning to view Bitcoin. It‚Äôs a bold, forward-thinking proposal that, if implemented, could have profound implications for the U.S. economy, the global financial landscape, and the future of Bitcoin itself. The journey of this bill through Congress will be closely watched by crypto enthusiasts, economists, and policymakers alike, as it could very well pave the way for a new era of digital asset integration into national financial strategies. This is a space to watch closely ‚Äì the future of finance is unfolding before our eyes.

The agency recently postponed its ruling on whether Cboe BZX can list options on Fidelity‚Äôs Ether ETF, pushing the deadline to May 14. Meanwhile, asset manager Franklin Templeton has filed for a Solana ETF with Cboe BZX, proposing that the fund be allowed to stake its SOL holdings for additional rewards. SEC Delays Decision on Cboe BZX‚Äôs Request to List Options on Fidelity‚Äôs Ether ETF The US SEC has postponed its ruling on whether the Cboe BZX Exchange can list options tied to Fidelity‚Äôs Ethereum exchange-traded fund (ETF). According to a March 12 SEC filing , the regulatory body has extended its decision deadline to May 14, giving itself additional time to review the proposal. The delay marks yet another instance of the SEC exercising caution in the evolving cryptocurrency investment landscape. While the introduction of options on Ether ETFs would represent a major milestone in integrating digital assets into traditional financial markets, regulatory uncertainty continues to loom over such innovations. Cboe BZX initially submitted its request to list options on Fidelity‚Äôs Ether ETF (FETH) in January. If approved, this move could significantly enhance liquidity and institutional engagement in the Ethereum market by allowing sophisticated investors to hedge their positions and employ advanced trading strategies. Options trading plays a crucial role in the traditional financial ecosystem, providing traders with flexibility in managing risk and leveraging market movements. By extending this mechanism to Ether ETFs, institutional investors could gain a new level of exposure to Ethereum while mitigating potential downside risks. Fidelity‚Äôs FETH currently holds approximately $780 million in net assets, making it one of the leading Ether ETFs in the market. As institutional interest in Ethereum continues to grow, the ability to trade options on such funds would further cement Ether‚Äôs position as a mainstream financial asset. The SEC‚Äôs latest delay comes against the backdrop of a wave of cryptocurrency ETF-related filings in recent months. In February, the agency acknowledged over a dozen exchange filings for various crypto-related ETFs. This increased engagement suggests a possible shift in the regulatory approach to digital assets under the new administration of US President Donald Trump, who assumed office for his second term on Jan. 20. While the SEC has long been cautious in its handling of cryptocurrency-related financial products, the acknowledgment of these filings indicates a gradual opening toward more crypto-friendly regulations. Market analysts speculate that the current wave of delays could be a sign that the SEC is carefully assessing the broader impact of approving options trading on Ether ETFs. Beyond the options listing, Cboe BZX made another groundbreaking request on March 11, asking the SEC for permission to incorporate Ethereum staking into Fidelity‚Äôs Ether ETF. If approved, this would mark the first instance of a publicly traded US Ether fund allowing staking‚Äîa mechanism that enables investors to earn rewards by locking up their ETH with validators on the Ethereum network. Staking has become an increasingly popular way to generate passive income within the crypto ecosystem. However, concerns over regulatory scrutiny have prevented major US-based crypto ETFs from integrating staking rewards into their offerings. The SEC‚Äôs stance on staking remains unclear, with the agency previously cracking down on certain staking services provided by centralized exchanges like Kraken. Approval of staking within an Ether ETF would be a major development, as it could enhance returns for investors and make these funds even more attractive compared to traditional investment vehicles. Competition Heats Up Among Ethereum ETFs While Fidelity‚Äôs FETH remains one of the more prominent Ether ETFs, BlackRock‚Äôs iShares Ethereum Trust (ETHA) leads the market with more than $3.7 billion in net assets, according to VettaFi data. The SEC is set to decide by April whether Nasdaq can list options tied to ETHA, a decision that could set a precedent for future approvals, including Fidelity‚Äôs bid. Ethereum ETFs have gained significant traction since their launch in July 2024, collectively amassing nearly $7 billion in net assets. Their growing adoption suggests increasing institutional confidence in Ethereum as a long-term asset class. With multiple filings under review, the SEC‚Äôs upcoming decisions could have profound implications for the cryptocurrency market. The agency has set an April deadline to rule on Nasdaq‚Äôs request to list options on BlackRock‚Äôs ETHA, while Cboe‚Äôs request to list options on Fidelity‚Äôs FETH will be addressed by May. If approved, options trading on Ether ETFs could open the floodgates for even greater institutional participation, further legitimizing Ethereum as an investable asset. However, the SEC‚Äôs history of delays and cautious approach suggests that regulatory approval is far from guaranteed. Cboe Files for Franklin Templeton‚Äôs Solana ETF Amid Growing Institutional Interest in Crypto In other ETF news, the Chicago Board Options BZX Exchange (Cboe) has officially submitted an application on behalf of asset management giant Franklin Templeton to list a Solana (SOL) exchange-traded fund (ETF) in the United States. According to a March 12 filing , Franklin Templeton‚Äôs proposed ETF will hold spot Solana, with an additional request to allow staking. The filing emphasized the importance of staking, likening it to traditional equity funds collecting dividends. The proposed Franklin Templeton Solana ETF aligns with the increasing trend of institutional interest in Solana, a blockchain network that has gained significant traction for its high-speed, low-cost transactions and growing decentralized finance (DeFi) and NFT ecosystems. The filing made a strong case for allowing staking, arguing that barring the ETF from staking its SOL would be equivalent to refusing dividends from stocks held in an equity-based exchange-traded product (ETP). Franklin Templeton‚Äôs foray into Solana follows its registration of a Solana trust on Feb. 10, joining major asset managers such as Grayscale, Bitwise, VanEck, 21Shares, and Canary Capital‚Äîall of whom have submitted applications to launch Solana investment products. Despite this momentum, regulatory approval remains uncertain. The SEC has historically taken a cautious approach to crypto-based financial products, often delaying or rejecting applications due to concerns over market manipulation, volatility, and investor protection. Solana‚Äôs inclusion in Franklin Templeton‚Äôs ETF filing is particularly noteworthy given its brief mention in the early crypto stockpile discussions by the Trump administration. Before scaling back to include only tokens seized through enforcement actions, President Trump initially named Solana among the assets considered for inclusion in the US government's digital holdings. This initial recognition by the administration, combined with Franklin Templeton‚Äôs growing involvement in the crypto sector, suggests a potential shift in how US regulators might view Solana as an institutional-grade investment asset. While the Franklin Templeton Solana ETF filing marks a significant milestone, it arrives amid continued regulatory delays on crypto-based investment products. The SEC, now operating under new leadership following former Chair Gary Gensler‚Äôs resignation in January 2025, recently announced that it would delay decisions on several altcoin ETF applications. This postponement reflects the regulator‚Äôs cautious stance as it evaluates whether approving ETFs for alternative cryptocurrencies aligns with its investor protection mandate. However, Bloomberg ETF analyst James Seyffart pointed out that such delays are standard procedure and do not necessarily indicate a lower probability of approval. Seyffart emphasized that the final deadline for these altcoin ETFs is not until October 2025, leaving ample time for regulatory assessments and potential adjustments. Franklin Templeton CEO Optimistic About Crypto Integration Franklin Templeton‚Äôs CEO, Jenny Johnson, remains optimistic about the evolving regulatory landscape under the Trump administration. In a Jan. 21 interview with Bloomberg, Johnson expressed confidence in a pro-crypto agenda that could lead to the deeper integration of traditional finance with blockchain technology. ‚ÄúI do think that it‚Äôs likely that ETFs and mutual funds will ultimately be built on blockchain just because it‚Äôs an incredibly efficient technology,‚Äù Johnson said. Her comments are part of the broader industry sentiment that blockchain could revolutionize traditional financial products, offering increased transparency, reduced settlement times, and enhanced security. If approved, Franklin Templeton‚Äôs Solana ETF would provide traditional investors with regulated exposure to SOL without the need for direct ownership or private key management. The additional request to incorporate staking could further enhance investor returns, making the ETF an attractive option for both retail and institutional investors. While the SEC‚Äôs regulatory timeline remains uncertain, the increasing number of filings for Solana-based investment products signals growing confidence in the blockchain‚Äôs long-term viability. Institutional interest continues to rise, and with market heavyweights like Franklin Templeton backing Solana, it may only be a matter of time before SOL joins Bitcoin and Ethereum in the ranks of fully regulated investment vehicles.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,REGULATION|SOL|ETH|BUSINESS|MARKET,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-03-13 05:30:00

Everyone knows this, which is why BTC remains the top player in the market to this day. However, with great power also comes great responsibility, or in this case ‚Äì a huge market cap. Since BTC is as large as it is, it doesn‚Äôt have much room for growth, at least not in the short term. Because of this, Bitcoin holders are investing heavily in FXGuys ($FXG), as this new project has virtually unlimited room for growth and great potential. It brings a great new crypto trading platform to the market, one that will help traders make money in all market conditions, even now! >>>JOIN FXGUYS HERE BTC‚Äôs Price Falls as Bitcoin Whales Take Profit It takes a lot for BTC‚Äôs price to move. This can be seen through a new BTC-related development. Namely, in the last two weeks 4,375 new wallets holding over 1 BTC token have been created . Even though this is quite a sizable lot, it still didn‚Äôt really move the Bitcoin price. However, Bitcoin whales taking profits did. Bitcoin whales recently realized over $80 million in profits, selling their BTC tokens as they did. Now this did affect the BTC price, as it fell by around 2% shortly after. BTC‚Äôs price is now at $88,268, but due to Trump adding BTC to the upcoming U.S. Crypto Reserve, Bitcoin‚Äôs price is 4.83% higher than it was 7 days ago. So, it‚Äôs clear that BTC‚Äôs price movements are a bit uncertain right now, which is mostly because of the current overly bearish crypto market. Experts aren‚Äôt sure where the Bitcoin price will go by year-end, as an extended bearish market could cause the BTC price to plunge below $80,000 soon. However, if bulls take over, then BTC‚Äôs price could cross $100,000 again this year. Thus, they recommend patience to all Bitcoin holders, and that‚Äôs what they‚Äôre getting. Namely, many Bitcoin holders are now flocking to FXGuys while they wait for the uncertainty surrounding BTC to die down. Also, they‚Äôre investing in this new crypto trading platform as it offers much more potential than Bitcoin does right now!

While Ethereum grapples with uncertain demand and macro factors, Rollblock‚Äôs revenue-based casino model gains momentum, highlighting how user-focused innovation can prevail despite broader market headwinds. Rollblock‚Äôs Approach to Rewards and Transparency Rollblock (RBLK) positions itself as a next-generation casino platform where players benefit directly from the platform‚Äôs success. Up to 30% of weekly gaming revenue goes to RBLK token buybacks, ensuring steady demand. Beyond that, Rollblock emphasizes player engagement and loyalty, granting access to exclusive perks and governance votes for those who hold its token. This approach resonates with users seeking real value, not just short-term gains. A good example here is Crypto RJ, who highlighted Rollblock as the best crypto coin in the GambleFi sector. At a time when many crypto projects rely on hype or unproven utilities, Rollblock‚Äôs actual revenue distribution stands out. Its presale has already secured more than $10 million , with tokens currently at $0.061, reflecting robust interest. Why Ethereum Struggles with Market Sentiment Even with a storied history as the second-largest cryptocurrency, Ethereum ‚Äôs vulnerability has become more apparent. The ETH price recently tested deeper lows, stirring fears of a potential breakdown if psychological support cracks. Observers say a variety of factors, including macroeconomic uncertainties and occasional whale liquidations, weigh heavily on ETH ‚Äôs outlook. The Ethereum price monthly price trend. Source: CoinGecko Complicating matters further, Ethereum ‚Äôs evolving network upgrades can create mixed messages. While improvements like sharding or scaling solutions promise efficiency boosts, they also push the narrative that Ethereum is still a work in progress. The Role of a Potential Bull Run Amid these headwinds, some analysts believe the next bull run could rejuvenate Ethereum . Historically, ETH has surged during bullish phases, offering a glimpse of its transformative potential. If institutional capital inflows or more favorable regulations accelerate, Ethereum might reclaim a dominant role in DeFi and NFTs. Yet skepticism lingers. If the global environment remains risk-off, large investors might sideline crypto allocations or look for tokens that promise near-term returns. That scenario complicates a full-scale bull run for Ethereum , especially if macro indicators remain bearish. How Rollblock Differentiates Itself Rollblock ‚Äôs model hinges on revenue, not speculation. The platform‚Äôs buyback program helps stabilize RBLK, mitigating panic selling when sentiment wavers. This design is particularly appealing to investors wary of abrupt price swings that plague purely speculative coins. Moreover, RBLK‚Äôs straightforward premise‚Äîa profitable casino distributing part of its earnings‚Äîmakes it less reliant on unclear roadmaps or hype-driven narratives. While Ethereum focuses on broad ecosystems and decentralized applications, Rollblock solves a more direct problem: how to reward users from existing, consistent income. ETH vs. RBLK: Contrasting Investment Paths Ethereum ‚Äôs open structure and large ecosystem still attract developers and projects. It‚Äôs a cornerstone of decentralized finance, with a diverse user base. If a bull run arrives, ETH holders could see meaningful gains, assuming the project maintains its lead in innovation. Rollblock , however, appeals to those preferring steady, revenue-backed potential. Its smaller market cap leaves room for growth, and the built-in buyback system could stabilize or elevate its price, irrespective of broader market dips. That reliability stands in stark contrast to Ethereum ‚Äôs repeated volatility. Implications for 2025 With ETH approaching critical levels , many wonder if upcoming upgrades will reverse the downturn or if external issues will keep pressure on the ETH price .

Imagine a calm sea, beautiful on the surface, yet hinting at the powerful storms brewing beneath. That‚Äôs a fitting analogy for Asia FX Markets right now. Traders are keenly observing the interplay of persistent trade tariffs, the ever-present specter of recession, and the recent strengthening of the US dollar following the latest Consumer Price Index (CPI) data release. For those involved in crypto or traditional finance, understanding these forex movements is crucial as they ripple across all markets, influencing investment strategies and risk assessments. Let‚Äôs dive into the factors creating this muted yet critical moment in Asia‚Äôs forex landscape. Why are Currency Tariffs Casting a Long Shadow on Asia FX? Tariffs, essentially taxes on imported goods, are more than just trade barriers; they are economic disruptors. For Asia, a region heavily reliant on international trade, especially with major economies like the United States and China, currency tariffs represent a significant headwind. Here‚Äôs why they are so impactful: Reduced Trade Volumes: Tariffs increase the cost of goods, making them less competitive in international markets. This can lead to a decrease in export volumes from Asian nations, directly impacting their trade balances and, consequently, their currencies. Supply Chain Disruptions: Global supply chains are intricately woven. Tariffs can unravel these chains, forcing businesses to rethink production locations, often leading to inefficiencies and increased costs. This uncertainty weighs heavily on investor sentiment and FX valuations. Currency Devaluation Pressure: To offset the negative impacts of tariffs, some countries might be tempted to devalue their currencies to make their exports cheaper. However, this can trigger a ‚Äòrace to the bottom‚Äô and lead to currency volatility, unsettling Asia FX Markets . Consider the ongoing trade tensions between major global players. These disputes, often manifested through tariff impositions, create a climate of uncertainty. Businesses become hesitant to invest, consumers may delay spending, and this collective caution reflects in the subdued movements of Asian currencies. It‚Äôs a domino effect where trade policy directly influences forex market behavior. Global Recession Fears : Are They Justified and How Do They Impact Asia FX? The ‚ÄòR‚Äô word ‚Äì Recession ‚Äì is increasingly being whispered in economic circles. Are these global recession fears justified, and how do they translate to the forex markets in Asia? Several factors are fueling these concerns: Inflationary Pressures: While inflation might be showing signs of cooling in some regions, it remains elevated in many parts of the world. Persistent high inflation erodes purchasing power and forces central banks to maintain or even increase interest rates, potentially slowing economic growth. Geopolitical Instability: Ongoing conflicts and geopolitical tensions add another layer of complexity. These events can disrupt energy supplies, increase commodity prices, and further fuel inflationary pressures, heightening recession risks. Slowing Global Growth: Major economies are showing signs of deceleration. China‚Äôs growth, while still robust compared to many nations, is facing headwinds. Europe is grappling with energy crises and the fallout from geopolitical events. A synchronized global slowdown inevitably impacts export-oriented economies in Asia. When recession fears escalate, investors typically flock to safe-haven assets. In the forex world, the US dollar often plays this role. As investors seek safety, demand for the dollar rises, strengthening it against other currencies, including those in Asia. This flight to safety contributes to the muted performance of Asia FX Markets during periods of heightened recession concerns. US Dollar Strength : Riding High Post-CPI ‚Äì What‚Äôs Next for Asia FX? The US dollar has demonstrated remarkable resilience, particularly after recent CPI data releases. But what exactly is driving this US Dollar Strength , and how does it influence Asian currencies? The latest CPI figures, while showing a slight moderation in inflation, still suggest that inflationary pressures are not completely tamed. This has led markets to anticipate that the Federal Reserve (Fed) will likely maintain its hawkish stance on interest rates. Higher interest rates make dollar-denominated assets more attractive to investors globally, increasing demand for the dollar. Here‚Äôs the impact of a strong dollar on Asia FX: Increased Import Costs: For Asian countries that import goods priced in US dollars (like commodities), a stronger dollar makes these imports more expensive in local currency terms. This can contribute to imported inflation. Debt Servicing Challenges: Many Asian nations hold dollar-denominated debt. A stronger dollar increases the cost of servicing this debt in local currency, potentially straining government finances and impacting economic stability. Competitive Pressures on Exports: A strong dollar can make Asian exports relatively more expensive compared to US goods in international markets, potentially hurting export competitiveness. The interplay between US Dollar Strength and Asia FX Markets is a critical dynamic to watch. If the dollar continues its upward trajectory, Asian currencies could face further downward pressure. Conversely, any signs of a weakening dollar could provide some breathing room for Asian FX. Decoding Inflation CPI Data : Is it a Friend or Foe to Asia FX? Inflation CPI data releases are pivotal moments for forex markets. The Consumer Price Index (CPI) measures the average change in prices paid by urban consumers for a basket of consumer goods and services. It‚Äôs a key indicator of inflation, and central banks closely monitor it to guide their monetary policy decisions. But is this data a friend or foe to Asia FX Markets ? The answer is nuanced and depends on the context: Higher-than-expected CPI: If CPI data comes in higher than anticipated, it typically strengthens the currency of the country releasing the data (in this case, the US dollar). This is because it signals potential for further interest rate hikes to combat inflation, making the currency more attractive to investors. For Asia FX Markets , this usually translates to downward pressure. Lower-than-expected CPI: Conversely, if CPI data is lower than expected, it can suggest that inflationary pressures are easing. This might lead to expectations of a less hawkish stance from the central bank, potentially weakening the currency. This could offer some relief to Asia FX Markets , allowing for potential appreciation. CPI Trends and Future Expectations: Beyond a single data point, the trend of CPI data is crucial. Is inflation consistently declining? Is it plateauing? Market reactions are heavily influenced by these trends and future expectations regarding inflation and central bank responses. For Asia FX Markets , understanding how to interpret Inflation CPI Data is essential. It‚Äôs not just about the immediate reaction but also about anticipating the longer-term implications for interest rates, economic growth, and currency valuations. Actionable Insights: Navigating the Current Forex Landscape So, what are the actionable takeaways from this complex interplay of tariffs, recession fears, dollar strength, and CPI data for those involved in crypto and traditional finance? Stay Informed: Keep a close watch on macroeconomic data releases, especially CPI, GDP growth figures, and trade policy announcements. These data points are crucial for understanding the direction of forex markets. Diversify your Portfolio: In times of uncertainty, diversification is key. Don‚Äôt overexpose yourself to a single currency or asset class. Consider a mix of assets, including cryptocurrencies, which can sometimes act as hedges against traditional market volatility. Risk Management is Paramount: Implement robust risk management strategies. Use stop-loss orders, manage your leverage, and be prepared for potential market swings. The current forex environment demands caution and preparedness. Understand Geopolitical Factors: Geopolitical events can have swift and significant impacts on forex markets. Stay informed about global political developments and their potential economic consequences. Seek Expert Advice: If you‚Äôre unsure how to navigate these complex market conditions, consider seeking advice from financial professionals. They can provide tailored guidance based on your risk tolerance and investment goals. Conclusion: A Muted Market with Powerful Potential for Change The current muted state of Asia FX Markets is not a sign of inactivity, but rather a reflection of the powerful, often conflicting forces at play. Currency Tariffs , global recession fears , US dollar strength driven by inflation CPI data ‚Äì these are all significant factors shaping the forex landscape. While the market might appear calm on the surface, beneath it lies a dynamic environment ripe with potential for significant shifts. By staying informed, understanding the key drivers, and implementing sound risk management strategies, investors can navigate this uncertainty and position themselves to capitalize on future opportunities in the ever-evolving world of forex and cryptocurrencies.

On-chain data from Arkham Intelligence confirms that these addresses, which have historically transferred SOL to major exchanges like Coinbase and Binance, now hold approximately $178.82 million in SOL. However, despite the substantial movement of funds, Solana‚Äôs price remains largely unaffected. FTX and Alameda‚Äôs Staking History Since the FTX collapse, Alameda has consistently shuffled large amounts of crypto assets. Since November 2023, FTX/Alameda has moved a staggering 7.845 million SOL‚Äîworth over $1 billion‚Äîto exchanges. Even after this latest unlock, their staking address still holds around 5.5 million SOL, valued at $693.8 million. The broader FTX reimbursement process has also led to the release of $1.57 billion worth of Solana tokens. Interestingly, previous Alameda asset movements‚Äîsuch as staking $10 million in MATIC or transferring $14.75 million in Ethereum‚Äîcaused noticeable price swings. Yet, despite today‚Äôs significant SOL unlock, the market reaction has been surprisingly muted. Why Didn‚Äôt Solana‚Äôs Price Move? Unlike previous movements, Solana‚Äôs price barely moved following Alameda‚Äôs $23 million unlock. Instead, SOL‚Äôs minor fluctuations happened before the transaction, driven by other market factors. In contrast, Ethereum jumped 10% when Alameda transferred a significantly smaller $14.75 million worth of ETH earlier this year. A possible reason for the lack of impact is the broader bearish sentiment in the crypto market. The SEC‚Äôs recent delay on multiple Solana ETF applications has added to the negative outlook, causing uncertainty. Meanwhile, Extreme Fear is gripping the market, leading to heavy outflows from major cryptocurrencies. What‚Äôs Next for Alameda‚Äôs Unlocked SOL? So far, Alameda has not disclosed how it plans to use the unstaked Solana tokens. One possibility is that these funds will be used for FTX creditor repayments, a process that began last month and is expected to take a long time. Given the scale of FTX‚Äôs outstanding obligations, however, even large token unlocks may not significantly shift Solana‚Äôs supply-demand balance. For now, Alameda‚Äôs latest move is just another chapter in the ongoing FTX saga. But with billions of dollars in SOL still in play, the market will be watching closely for its next steps.",News|Crypto news,EN,0,0,SOL|RESEARCH|MARKET|TRADING|ETH,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-03-13 05:36:50

The S&P 500, after reaching a record high on February 19, has since dropped more than 9%, with the Nasdaq Composite sinking 13%, according to data from CNBC. The US economy is now facing growing uncertainty because of that, and so investors are scrambling to reposition. Tech, airline, and bank stocks collapse as investors pull out Tech stocks that dominated the market have been slammed in the Wall Street sell off. Nvidia, which rode the AI hype, has tumbled by over 20% as investors worry about China‚Äôs expanding AI sector after the rise of DeepSeek. Tesla, which surged after President Donald Trump‚Äôs election victory, has crashed by 36%, erasing all of those gains as Elon Musk desperately tries to win back investors. Palantir, once flying high on US government contracts, has lost 30% after peaking last month amid Wall Street sell-off. Among the ‚ÄúMagnificent Seven‚Äù, Microsoft has held up the best but is still down 8%, the data shows. Airlines have also been hit hard, with Delta, American Airlines, and United Airlines all dropping by nearly 30% since the S&P 500 hit all-time highs back in December. Investors are reacting to warnings about lower demand and a possible slowdown in consumer spending. Banks are feeling the pressure of the Wall Street sell-off too. Citigroup, Morgan Stanley, and Goldman Sachs are all down 20% as recession fears increase and traders worry about slower corporate growth. The market‚Äôs shift away from risk is leaving banks in a tough spot. Goldman Sachs has cut its S&P 500 target, with David Kostin now expecting the index to rise 10% from current levels, instead of from 2024 levels. In an investor note sent on Tuesday, Kostin explained to investors that the ‚ÄúMagnificent Seven‚Äù accounted for more than half of the total correction, but he also warned that the market‚Äôs problems extend far beyond those stocks. Meanwhile, the Wall Street crash has also exposed how top-heavy the US market has become, as the equal-weighted S&P 500, which treats all stocks the same, is down by 6%, according to the CNBC data. Investors are now betting on defensive stocks But while others are tanking, defensive stocks are thriving, as American Water Works is up by 12%, and Merck & Co has climbed by 11%. US Steel and Nucor have also seen gains, benefiting from Trump‚Äôs latest trade threats, including a 50% tariff on Canadian steel imports. Some tech stocks that were previously ignored are holding up. Cisco and IBM, which have been left out of the AI boom, are only down by 6% since February and have managed to stay in positive territory for the year, according to data gotten from Google Finance. Small-cap stocks, which you‚Äôd expect to benefit from the tech sell-off as they have historically in the past and also surged after the election thanks to Trump‚Äôs promised tax cuts and deregulation to boost the economy, have instead crashed along with the Magnificent 7. Unlike last August, when small-caps rallied after a tech sell-off, this time they‚Äôre sinking alongside everything else. Also, the US stock market‚Äôs premium over European markets is shrinking. Years of outperformance made US stocks far more expensive than European ones, but the recent Wall Street drop has changed that. The S&P 500‚Äôs forward price-earnings ratio has fallen from 26x to 21x, while European stocks have only dropped from 15x to 14x, proving that investors who once saw Wall Street as the safest bet are now rethinking their positions, according to a note from Goldman Sachs on Tuesday. Consumer confidence has crashed, with February posting the biggest one-month drop since the pandemic, and though egg and gas prices have actually gone low, inflation concerns continue to haunt investors. Wall Street hedge funds like Citadel and Bridgewater are unwinding their positions. Moreover, bond markets are now pricing in three to four 25bp rate cuts this year, showing that Wall Street expects weaker economic growth ahead. While some analysts argue that a recession isn‚Äôt the ‚Äúbase case‚Äù yet, we‚Äôre pretty sure not everyone‚Äôs buying it. Trump himself admitted that he isn‚Äôt ruling out a recession for this year. Cryptopolitan Academy: Tired of market swings? Learn how DeFi can help you build steady passive income.

In response to the rising demand from institutions, Armstrong has hinted at plans to add 1,000 new staff members by 2025, citing increased regulatory clarity. Following his attendance of the White House crypto summit, he noted that the change in U.S. regulatory policy gives Coinbase greater confidence to make domestic investments.

Dalbon submitted a request to prosecutor Eduardo Taiano and judge Mar√≠a Servini, who are probing President Javier Milei‚Äôs involvement in the memecoin , seeking for an Interpol Red Notice to be issued for Davis, local outlets P√°gina 12 and Perfil reported on March 11. Dalbon said in the filing that there was a ‚Äúprocedural risk‚Äù if Davis remained free as he could have access to vast amounts of money that would allow him to either flee the US or go into hiding. ‚ÄúHis central role in the creation and promotion of the $LIBRA cryptocurrency, coupled with the international impact of the case, increases the likelihood that he will take steps to evade justice,‚Äù the document reportedly stated. Dalbon, who represented former Argentine president Cristina Fern√°ndez de Kirchner in her corruption case, asked for Davis‚Äô arrest and for ‚Äúan Interpol red notice [to] be issued in order to locate and arrest him, with a view to his extradition.‚Äù Interpol is the biggest international police organization and can issue Red Notices that request law enforcement agencies around the world to locate and provisionally arrest someone. LIBRA is a token that Milei shared across his social media accounts just minutes after its creation on Feb. 14, which catapulted it to a peak value of over $4 billion. The token‚Äôs creators held most of the supply and quickly sold their holdings, which caused the token‚Äôs price to crash , with many claiming the token was a pump-and-dump scheme. Hayden Davis (left) poses with Argentine President Javier Milei. Source: Javier Milei Days later, various lawyers reportedly filed fraud charges against Milei in an Argentine criminal court for promoting the token, while other lawyers reported the president for financial crimes to local authorities and to the US Justice Department. Related: Memecoins are likely dead for now, but they‚Äôll be back: CoinGecko Milei has claimed he didn‚Äôt ‚Äúpromote‚Äù the LIBRA token and insisted he just ‚Äúspread the word‚Äù about it. In a lengthy interview days after LIBRA‚Äôs collapse with YouTuber Stephen Findeisen, better known as ‚ÄúCoffeezilla,‚Äù Davis defended the token as a failure rather than a scam. Davis and his firm, Kelsier Ventures, were the biggest winners from the LIBRA token launch. He claimed to Findeisen that he netted around $100 million but said he didn‚Äôt own the tokens and wouldn‚Äôt be selling them. It was later reported that he sent a text message bragging about being able to pay Milei‚Äôs sister, Karina Milei, to have the president share the memecoin‚Äôs details on X. Davis later said he had no record of this on his phone and denied making payments to the Mileis.

A recent trade on Hyperliquid‚Äôs HLP vault wiped out $4 million‚Äînot due to a bug or an exploit, but through a calculated move that exploited market mechanics. A trader turned $10 million USDC into a $271 million Ethereum long position, walked away with $1.8 million in profit, and left HLP to absorb the loss. It is considered as the biggest single day loss since its launch in May 2023. Crypto analyst Three Sigma is questioning whether protocols relying on liquidations are playing into the hands of savvy traders. One trader VS. Hyperliquid‚Äôs HLP vault. $4M gone. No bug. No exploit. Just a brutal game of liquidity mechanics. Here‚Äôs how they pulled it off. pic.twitter.com/ivkMBcwS2q ‚Äî Three Sigma (@threesigmaxyz) March 12, 2025 The Setup: A Trader‚Äôs Clever Play In simple terms, HLP is Hyperliquid‚Äôs liquidity pool , where users can deposit funds to passively earn from market-making and liquidations. It generally profits when traders lose, but automated strategies can sometimes be exploited. This happened when a trader withdrew collateral, forcing HLP to take over a bad trade, leading to a $4 million loss. Trading at massive size comes with a challenge‚Äîhow to exit a position without crashing the market. Instead of selling ETH directly into the order books, the trader played the system. They withdrew their collateral, reducing their margin and triggering a forced liquidation. This move offloaded their entire position onto Hyperliquid‚Äôs HLP vault, which took on the $286 million ETH long. Knowing that HLP‚Äôs forced selling would drive ETH prices lower , the trader had a hedge ready. By shorting ETH on another exchange‚Äîpotentially Binance‚Äîthey ensured profits from the price drop while HLP absorbed the risk. It was a calculated move, not an accident. Analyst View: Was This an Exploit? Hyperliquid maintains that this wasn‚Äôt a traditional exploit. Unlike GLP, which is forced to take the other side of trades, Hyperliquid‚Äôs model allows for market makers to step in. In this case, while HLP suffered a $4 million loss, it wasn‚Äôt system-breaking‚Äîthe vault remains profitable overall. The loss was simply execution slippage, meaning the liquidator couldn‚Äôt perfectly match entry and exit prices. Analyst further points out that this isn‚Äôt the first time HLP has been targeted. In 2023, an attacker manipulated SNX prices on centralized exchanges, exploiting the vault for $37,000. Since then, Hyperliquid has adjusted its pricing models to prevent similar incidents. Regarding commentary and questions on the 0xf3f4 user's ETH long: To be clear: There was no protocol exploit or hack. This user had unrealized PNL, withdrew, which lowered their margin, and was liquidated. They ended with ~$1.8M in PNL. HLP lost ~$4M over the past 24h. HLP's‚Ä¶ ‚Äî Hyperliquid (@HyperliquidX) March 12, 2025 Will This Happen Again? Hyperliquid Responds Following the loss, Hyperliquid quickly implemented risk adjustments, including lowering max leverage to 40x for Bitcoin and 25x for Ethereum, and increasing margin requirements for large positions. More adjustments to HLP‚Äôs risk models are likely on the way. The incident briefly caused a 12% drop in Hyperliquid‚Äôs HYPE token , though it later recovered. Despite the loss, HLP remains profitable, having generated $60 million for investors since launch. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

Ripple (XRP) Climbs 18% to reclaim $2.24 as market recovery phase begins Ripple (XRP) price surged to $2.24 on Thursday, marking its highest opening price this week. As the latest U.S. Consumer Price Index ( CPI ) figures indicated easing inflation, traders are betting on a Fed rate pause. The CME Group‚Äôs FedWatch tool now suggests a 99% likelihood that the Fed will leave interest rates unchanged in its upcoming March 21 meeting. XRP price analysis Despite the bullish macroeconomic backdrop, Ripple price faces resistance near $2.50, requiring a substantial increase in trading volumes to maintain its upward momentum. If market inflows intensify, XRP could extend its rally toward the critical $3 mark. Ripple (XRP) Traders Expect Fresh Inflows as CME Group Signals 99% Chance of Fed Rate Pause Ripple (XRP) has experienced a notable price recovery over the past 48 hours, responding to a series of positive macroeconomic developments. On Thursday, XRP opened trading at $2.24, marking an 18% rise from Tuesday‚Äôs local low of $1.90. The recent price uptick coincided with growing optimism over a potential ceasefire in the Russia-Ukraine conflict and a cooling inflation trend in the U.S. economy. February‚Äôs CPI data revealed that the inflation rate eased to 2.8%, down from 3% in January, and below the anticipated 2.9%. On a monthly basis, CPI rose just 0.2%, significantly lower than January‚Äôs 0.5% increase. FedWatch Tool, March 13 2025 | Source: CME Group Market sentiment suggests that these inflation figures have alleviated concerns sparked by last Friday‚Äôs disappointing U.S. Non-Farm Payroll (NFP) report, which initially fueled recession fears. In response, traders are shifting their outlook toward a prolonged period of steady interest rates, boosting investor confidence across risk assets like XRP. Taking these developments into account, CME Group‚Äôs FedWatch tool ‚Äîwidely used by institutional investors‚Äînow signals a near-certain 99% probability that the Federal Reserve will maintain current rates in its March 21 decision. Should this outlook hold, crypto markets, including XRP, could see renewed capital inflows as traders who previously exited amid NFP uncertainty re-enter positions, anticipating a sustained bullish trend. XRP Derivative market analysis The latest XRP derivatives data from Coinglass indicates an emerging bullish sentiment, as key metrics suggest increasing trader confidence. Open interest has risen by 3.48% to $3.05 billion, signalling growing commitment among traders to their existing positions. More so, options open interest surged 10.69% to $1.37 million, reflecting a stronger institutional appetite for leveraged exposure to XRP price movements. XRP Derivative market analysis | March 13 While spot volume has dipped slightly by 3.96% to $8.35 billion, the increase in open interest suggests that traders are positioning for a potential upside rather than exiting the market. Further reinforcing the bullish case, Binance‚Äôs long/short ratio for XRP/USDT accounts stands at 2.49, while OKX traders show a similar bias with a 2.14 long/short ratio. This indicates that more traders are opening long positions in anticipation of further gains. Additionally, liquidation data shows that longs have outperformed shorts in recent liquidation events, with $4.25 million in long liquidations versus $4.61 million in short liquidations over 24 hours. This suggests that bears are losing control, potentially setting the stage for an XRP breakout above its $2.50 resistance level. XRP Price Forecast: Bulls Eye $2.60 as Market Recovers from Sell-off Phase XRP price is attempting to recover after a steep 27.53% correction, stabilizing above $2.24 as buyers defend the early recovery gains. According to market volume data, the XRP price rebound comes as volume contracts following a 1.63 billion token selloff, signaling that sellers are losing momentum. The recent 18.88% price surge over two days indicates renewed bullish pressure, with XRP attempting to reclaim the $2.34 resistance level, which aligns with the 20-day EMA. A successful breakout above this threshold could pave the way for a rally toward $2.60, where the upper Bollinger Band currently sits, acting as the next major resistance zone. XRP Price Forecast On the downside, failure to hold above $2.24 could reignite selling pressure, with the lower Bollinger Band at $1.92 emerging as key support. However, the long/short ratio data from Binance and OKX, showing a strong bullish bias, suggests market sentiment favors the upside. If momentum sustains, XRP could push toward $2.76, a key level from recent highs. However, a rejection at $2.34 may delay further gains, leaving the market range-bound before a decisive breakout.

Generally, the scammers will contact a target with a meeting offer or partnership, but once the call starts, they send a message feigning audio issues while a stock video of a bored venture capitalist is on the screen; they then send a link to a new call, according to Bax. Having audio issues on your Zoom call? That's not a VC, it's North Korean hackers. Fortunately, this founder realized what was going on. The call starts with a few ""VCs"" on the call.

Giulio Xiloyannis, co-founder of the blockchain gaming Mon Protocol, said scammers tried to dupe him and the head of marketing with a meeting about a partnership opportunity. However, he was alerted to the ruse when, at the last minute, he was prompted to use a Zoom link that ‚Äúpretends to not be able to read your audio to make you install malware.‚Äù ‚ÄúThe moment I saw a Gumicryptos partner speaking and a Superstate one I realized something was off,‚Äù he said. Source: Giulio Xiloyannis David Zhang, co-founder of US venture-backed stablecoin Stably, was also targeted. He said the scammers used his Google Meet link but then made up an excuse about an internal meeting, asking him to join that meeting instead. ‚ÄúThe site acted like a normal Zoom call. I took the call on my tablet though, so not sure what the behavior would‚Äôve been on desktop,‚Äù Zhang said. ‚ÄúIt probably tried to determine the OS before prompting the user to do something, but it just wasn‚Äôt built for mobile Oses.‚Äù Source: David Zhang Melbin Thomas, founder of Devdock AI, a decentralized AI platform for Web3 projects, said he was also hit with the scam and was unsure if his tech was still at risk. ‚ÄúThe same thing happened to me.

DeepSeek‚Äôs¬†Emergence: AI-Powered Innovation Triggers Industry Transformation In Q4 2024, the market saw a surge in top-tier AI Agents projects backed by Launchpads, driving a wave of asset issuance and quickly attracting capital and users. However, as the ICO rush began to subside, the hype in the AI Agents space had run its course. The market now urgently needed a catalyst to reignite growth. DeepSeek‚Äôs breakthrough technology leverages pure reinforcement learning (RL) to enhance AI‚Äôs reasoning capabilities while significantly reducing costs. This advancement positions AI as a more effective partner for real-world applications, transforming the AI Agent sector. This progress could breathe new life into the Agent field and reshape the industry landscape. The research report heralds DeepSeek‚Äôs debut as the ‚ÄúiPhone Moment‚Äù of the AI sector. Much like how the iPhone revolutionized the smartphone market, DeepSeek‚Äôs innovative technology is poised to lead a new era of crypto-tech development over the next few years. The Unique Value and Accelerating Growth of AI Agents The AI Agents ecosystem consists of four main sectors: AI Agent Frameworks: These serve as the core infrastructure for the AI Agents ecosystem, lowering development barriers and accelerating AI‚Äôs application. The Eliza project stands out with its technical innovations and sustainable business model. AI launchpads serve as hybrid incubators and trading platforms in the crypto space, lowering entry barriers for AI Agent projects and accelerating their launch, funding, and promotion. AI Agent meme coins, which blend AI and meme narratives, have strong potential to go viral, making them effective tools for rapid capital accumulation. Examples include BULLY from the Virtual ecosystem and TAOCAT and LLM from the Bittensor ecosystem. AI Agent applications focus on the implementation and commercialization of the technology in real-world scenarios, covering areas such as automated trading, asset management, market analysis, and cross-chain interaction. Representative projects are GRIFFAIN, NEUR, and BUZZ. AI Agent applications are expected to become the most promising segment in the sector. The report emphasizes that deep expertise and resilience are vital for the success of AI Agent teams. Teams like Virtual, SEKOIA, ai16z, and Swarm have proven this through their perseverance and dedication. Additionally, product usability is a critical factor in driving user adoption and widespread acceptance in the crypto market. 2025: The Maturation of Crypto Combining with Agents, Where Revenue and User Adoption Drive Value As the AI Agents market matures, it‚Äôs transitioning from a narrative-driven phase to one where value is based on data and revenue. The success of AI Agent projects will no longer be dictated by hype or the founding team‚Äôs pedigree but by their ability to achieve sustainable profitability and address real user needs through innovation. Directions that deserve future attention: Multi-Agent Systems and DeFAI (Decentralized Finance + AI): These sectors showcase AI‚Äôs tremendous potential for complex decision-making and financial automation, signaling long-term growth. Core Framework Updates: It‚Äôs essential to monitor the ongoing evolution of critical frameworks like Eliza and ARC, as their upgrades could create entirely new applications and business models. New Infrastructure Projects: AI models, data layers, and computing infrastructure tailored for the crypto ecosystem will be foundational to supporting the next-gen AI Agent ecosystem. As a leading investment institution,¬†HTX Ventures has consistently aligned its strategy with market trends. From backing DeepSeek to supporting AI Agents tokens, HTX Ventures sees tremendous potential in the synergy between AI and blockchain technologies, investing and positioning itself for the next wave of innovation.

41578169,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=139703,1741850720,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Surprising Bitcoin ETF Inflow: US Spot ETFs Recover with $14M Net Gain,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/bitcoin-etf-net-inflow-returns/,"After a spell of unease in the crypto markets, here‚Äôs a breath of fresh air: U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs have bounced back into positive territory! Ending a five-day run of net outflows, these investment vehicles collectively recorded a net inflow of $14.03 million on March 12th. Let‚Äôs dive into the details of this intriguing shift and what it might signal for the Bitcoin landscape. Bitcoin ETF Inflows Return: What Sparked the Turnaround? For the past week, the narrative surrounding spot Bitcoin ETFs had been dominated by net outflows, raising concerns about investor sentiment. However, data from Trader T (@thepfund) on X reveals a significant change on March 12th. A total net inflow of $14.03 million suggests a renewed interest, or at least a temporary pause in selling pressure, in these newly accessible Bitcoin investment products. This positive shift prompts the question: Is this a momentary blip, or the start of a sustained trend? Let‚Äôs break down the performance of individual ETFs to get a clearer picture. Spot Bitcoin ETF Performance: Who Were the Standout Performers? Not all crypto ETFs are created equal, and the March 12th data clearly illustrates this. While some funds enjoyed substantial inflows, others continued to experience outflows. Here‚Äôs a closer look at the key players: ARK Invest‚Äôs ARKB: The Star Performer ‚Äì Leading the pack by a significant margin, ARKB attracted a whopping $82.6 million in net inflows. This strong showing suggests robust investor confidence in ARK Invest‚Äôs Bitcoin ETF offering. Grayscale‚Äôs Mini BTC Trust (BTC): A Notable Inflow ‚Äì Following ARKB, Grayscale‚Äôs Mini BTC Trust also saw a positive inflow of $5.51 million. This is particularly interesting considering the outflows experienced by Grayscale‚Äôs original GBTC ETF. However, it wasn‚Äôt all green across the board. Several major ETFs experienced net outflows: BlackRock‚Äôs IBIT: A Rare Outflow ‚Äì Even industry giant BlackRock‚Äôs IBIT recorded net outflows of $46.36 million. While this might seem concerning, it‚Äôs crucial to remember that even the most successful ETFs can experience fluctuations in flows. Grayscale‚Äôs GBTC: Continued Outflows ‚Äì Grayscale‚Äôs GBTC continued its outflow trend, registering $11.81 million in net outflows. This ongoing trend is likely related to GBTC‚Äôs higher fee structure compared to newer spot Bitcoin ETFs. Other Outflows: Invesco‚Äôs BTCO ($12.4 million) and WisdomTree‚Äôs BTCW ($3.51 million) also experienced net outflows, indicating varying investor sentiment across different ETF providers. No Change: Interestingly, several other ETFs reported no changes in their holdings, suggesting a period of neutrality or balanced trading activity for these funds. To summarize the ETF performance, here‚Äôs a table for a clearer comparison: ETF Net Inflow/Outflow (March 12) ARK Invest‚Äôs ARKB $82.6 million (Inflow) Grayscale‚Äôs Mini BTC Trust $5.51 million (Inflow) BlackRock‚Äôs IBIT $46.36 million (Outflow) Grayscale‚Äôs GBTC $11.81 million (Outflow) Invesco‚Äôs BTCO $12.4 million (Outflow) WisdomTree‚Äôs BTCW $3.51 million (Outflow) Other ETFs No Change Decoding the ETF Inflows: What Does it Mean for the Bitcoin Market? The return to net ETF inflows , even at a modest $14.03 million, can be interpreted in several ways. Firstly, it could signal a temporary reprieve from selling pressure that had been impacting Bitcoin prices. Secondly, it might indicate that investors are viewing the recent price dips as buying opportunities, stepping in to accumulate Bitcoin exposure through ETFs. Thirdly, the strong performance of ARKB suggests that certain ETF issuers are successfully attracting new capital, potentially due to factors like marketing, brand recognition, or perceived fund management expertise. However, it‚Äôs crucial to maintain a balanced perspective. A single day of net inflows doesn‚Äôt necessarily confirm a long-term trend reversal. The Bitcoin market remains volatile and influenced by numerous factors, including macroeconomic conditions, regulatory developments, and broader risk sentiment. The outflows from IBIT and GBTC, despite the overall net inflow, also suggest that there‚Äôs still a degree of uncertainty or profit-taking occurring within the ETF space. Navigating the Crypto ETF Landscape: Actionable Insights for Investors For investors monitoring crypto ETFs , here are some actionable insights to consider: Diversification is Key: The varied performance of different ETFs highlights the importance of diversification. Don‚Äôt rely solely on one ETF provider; consider spreading your investments across multiple funds to mitigate risk. Monitor ETF Flows: Keep an eye on daily and weekly ETF flow data. Significant and sustained inflows can be a positive indicator for Bitcoin‚Äôs price, while consistent outflows may suggest bearish sentiment. Understand ETF Fee Structures: Be aware of the fees associated with different ETFs. Lower fees can result in better long-term returns, especially in a buy-and-hold strategy. GBTC‚Äôs higher fees are a key factor in its ongoing outflows. Consider ETF Holdings and Strategy: Research the underlying holdings and investment strategies of different ETFs. While most spot Bitcoin ETFs hold Bitcoin directly, nuances in custody solutions and fund management approaches may exist. Stay Informed: The crypto market is dynamic. Stay updated on market news, regulatory changes, and ETF developments to make informed investment decisions. Conclusion: A Glimmer of Hope or a Fleeting Moment? The $14.03 million net inflow into U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs on March 12th offers a welcome change from the recent outflow trend. While ARKB and Grayscale‚Äôs Mini BTC Trust led the inflows, the mixed performance across different ETFs underscores the evolving dynamics of this market. Whether this inflow marks the beginning of a sustained positive trend or a temporary pause remains to be seen. Investors should continue to monitor ETF flows, market sentiment, and broader macroeconomic factors to navigate the exciting yet unpredictable world of crypto investments.

Bitcoin reached its lowest point at $1,988 within a single day yet recovered by 3.9% before investors could pull out their funds. The market awaits confirmation from analysts to prove that ETH will break through resistance levels for an 18% price increase or fall to $1,500 due to descending triangle pressure. Investors now shift their focus to MUTM from Mutuum Finance because the DeFi token approaches the third presale phase while people expect major price increases. Ethereum‚Äôs Balancing Act The daily Ethereum price charts show a negative pattern of declining price levels accompanied by bearish patterns in significant moving averages which demonstrates weakening market strength. Despite a minor recovery, rejection near $2,152 underscores persistent selling pressure. The MACD technical indicators accompany bearish sentiment by showing sell signs while weekly exchange-traded fund withdrawals amount to $93.9 million dollars. Crypto analyst Ali Martinez detects a possible upward price movement when ETH is able to stay above significant trendlines for an 18% increase in value. The exposed position maintains dual characteristics which drives investors into temporary uncertainty. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Capitalizes on Market Jitters The Ethereum market instability creates an advantage for Mutuum Finance (MUTM) to emerge as a shining star during presales. Within Phase 3 of the project investors have contributed $3.1 million. The current price of $0.02 will increase to $0.025 during Phase 4. People who take part in early presales will receive a 25% profit boost during the following phase launch and the $0.06 listing value will result in a 200% profit increase for present purchasers. Research analysts predict that MUTM tokens will reach $3.50 by 2025 after presale completion which corresponds to a 17,400% value increase against current presale rates. The lending system of Mutuum Finance generates hope among its users. The platform generates innate demand for MUTM by issuing loans with multiple types of collateral and through mtTokens which represent deposits that generate an interest-bearing compensation. The tariff structure of the platform enhances supply reduction by pooling platform revenue into token purchases and stakeholder rewards. The project design delivers sustainable development support through its alignment against arbitrary resources without enduring substance. The period for investors to acquire Mutuum Finance at its lowest existing price is quickly running out. The current Phase 3 entry point at $0.02 is reaching quick sell-out levels while Phase 4 will boost its price by 25%. Phase 3 purchasers can seize a $0.06 exchange listing opportunity that provides triple returns before the platform launches to potentially deliver transformational profits. The early MUTM investors starting at $0.015 have secured a 400% profit increase while their potential profit potential might skyrocket if MUTM reaches its projected price of $3.50. Positioning for Exponential Returns Mathematical growth in combination with inherent market demand defines Mutuum Finance (MUTM) as an exceptional crypto investment opportunity. The presale success along with deflationary mechanisms in MUTM demonstrates better prospects than Ethereum‚Äôs wild market movements. Delaying would result in missing the last opportunity to buy MUTM tokens at low prices before volatility surges from exchange listings occur. The planned Ethereum volatility drives numerous investors to seek shelter in Mutuum Finance‚Äôs ongoing presale because its mathematical profitability model and practical utility features attract them. Waiting any longer to participate during Phase 3 will result in forfeiting what could become a 32 times profit opportunity. Buy MUTM tokens during this moment to secure your position in the market as prices will increase while the next price rally will leave your investment behind if delayed.

On March 13, Chainlink community liaison Zach Rynes described it as the ‚Äúmost bizarre clown market‚Äù he‚Äôs ever seen in crypto. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôve just seen the most bullish catalysts in the history of crypto in a single month, but the spooky macro conditions are suppressing positive market reactions,‚Äù he added.

Bear Market Fears Return Rynes listed some of the bullish fundamentals that have occurred recently, including the US establishing a strategic Bitcoin reserve , which eliminates the possibility of a crypto ban.¬†It also incentivizes nations around the world to begin stockpiling in an ‚Äúarms race of economic dominance.‚Äù There are also clear rules and regulations coming for stablecoins, market structure, and DeFi , ‚Äúenabling institutions to finally start engaging in the industry in a meaningful way while strengthening the dollar‚Äôs position,‚Äù he added.

Bitcoin has actually gained marginally over the past 12 hours to tap $84,000 during early trading in Asia on Thursday. However, the asset remains down more than 8% over the past week.

Alliance DAO Founder Sounds the Alarm on ETH‚Äôs Oversold State,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/ethereum-oversold-buying-temptation/,"Is Ethereum (ETH) currently presenting a golden buying opportunity? That‚Äôs the question rippling through the cryptocurrency community after prominent crypto figure Qiao Wang, a founding partner at Alliance DAO, declared Ethereum to be in an ‚Äúoversold‚Äù state. His recent comments on X (formerly Twitter) have sparked intense debate and renewed interest in the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization. Let‚Äôs dive deep into Wang‚Äôs analysis and what it could mean for you as a crypto investor. Is Ethereum Really Oversold? Qiao Wang‚Äôs Perspective Qiao Wang isn‚Äôt just any voice in the crypto space. As a founder of Alliance DAO, a significant player in decentralized autonomous organizations, his insights carry weight. Wang took to X to share his observation that Ethereum is oversold , drawing parallels to pivotal moments in crypto history. He specifically mentioned three instances where ETH price levels mirrored the current situation: The 2021 Terra Collapse: The dramatic implosion of the Terra ecosystem sent shockwaves through the entire crypto market, causing widespread panic and price drops, including for Ethereum. The 2018 Deep Bear Market: The infamous crypto winter of 2018 saw prolonged and significant price declines across the board, testing the resilience of even established cryptocurrencies like Ethereum. The Aftermath of the 2016 DAO Hack: The Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO) hack was a seminal event in Ethereum‚Äôs early days, leading to a hard fork and impacting investor confidence. Wang‚Äôs comparison to these critical junctures suggests he believes the current ETH price analysis reflects an undervaluation, potentially driven by market fear and uncertainty rather than fundamental weaknesses in Ethereum itself. He explicitly stated the temptation to buy ETH at these levels, indicating a belief in a potential price rebound. Why is Ethereum Oversold? Decoding the Market Dynamics To understand why Wang might consider Ethereum oversold , we need to look at the broader cryptocurrency market and specific factors impacting ETH. Several elements could be contributing to this perceived undervaluation: Macroeconomic Headwinds: Global economic uncertainty, inflation concerns, and rising interest rates often lead investors to reduce exposure to riskier assets like cryptocurrencies, putting downward pressure on prices. Regulatory Scrutiny: Ongoing regulatory debates and actions around cryptocurrencies create uncertainty and can dampen investor enthusiasm, particularly in the short term. Market Sentiment: Fear, uncertainty, and doubt (FUD) can become self-fulfilling prophecies in the crypto market. Negative news or price drops can trigger further selling, pushing prices below their intrinsic value. Profit-Taking and Rotation: After periods of growth, investors may take profits, leading to price corrections. Additionally, capital may rotate into other sectors or cryptocurrencies perceived to have higher short-term growth potential. These factors, combined with potentially exaggerated market reactions, could contribute to a situation where ETH price analysis suggests it‚Äôs trading below its fair value based on its technology, adoption, and long-term potential. The Contrarian View: Wang‚Äôs Past ETH Stance and Layer-2 Competition Interestingly, Wang‚Äôs current bullish (or at least ‚Äútempted to buy‚Äù) stance comes after he publicly disclosed selling his ETH holdings last year. In a podcast interview, he explained his decision, stating that after holding ETH for a decade, he believed its growth potential was nearing exhaustion. This highlights a crucial aspect of the Ethereum narrative: the rise of layer-2 solutions and competition from alternative blockchains like Solana. Wang estimated that Ethereum‚Äôs layer-2 scaling solutions, designed to improve transaction speed and reduce costs on the Ethereum network, have only a 10-20% chance of outperforming Solana (SOL). This is a significant statement, as it suggests he sees Solana, and potentially other layer-1 blockchains, as posing a serious challenge to Ethereum‚Äôs dominance in the long run. Ethereum Layer-2 Solutions vs. Solana: A Quick Comparison The debate between Ethereum‚Äôs layer-2 scaling approach and alternative layer-1 blockchains is central to understanding the future of the crypto ecosystem. Here‚Äôs a simplified comparison: Feature Ethereum Layer-2 Solutions (e.g., Arbitrum, Optimism, zkSync) Solana (SOL) Scaling Approach Off-chain processing while inheriting Ethereum‚Äôs security Optimized layer-1 blockchain for high throughput Transaction Speed Significantly faster and cheaper than mainnet Ethereum Very high transaction speed and low fees Ecosystem Maturity Growing ecosystem, but still developing compared to mainnet Ethereum Rapidly expanding ecosystem, gaining traction in DeFi and NFTs Security Inherits security from Ethereum mainnet Rely on its own consensus mechanism; security is constantly evolving Developer Adoption Strong developer community, leveraging Ethereum‚Äôs existing tools and resources Growing developer community, attracting projects seeking high performance Wang‚Äôs skepticism about Ethereum layer-2 solutions outperforming Solana likely stems from a belief that Solana‚Äôs layer-1 optimization offers a more direct and potentially more efficient path to scalability and user adoption. However, Ethereum‚Äôs layer-2 ecosystem is rapidly evolving, and advancements in technologies like zero-knowledge rollups could significantly alter this landscape. Actionable Insights: Navigating the Ethereum Oversold Situation So, what should you do with this information? Here are some actionable insights to consider: Do Your Own Research (DYOR): Wang‚Äôs opinion is valuable, but it‚Äôs crucial to conduct your own independent research. Look at Ethereum‚Äôs fundamentals, network activity, developer updates, and the broader market conditions. Consider Risk Tolerance: Investing in cryptocurrencies is inherently risky. Assess your risk tolerance and only invest what you can afford to lose. An oversold Ethereum might present an opportunity, but it‚Äôs not without risk. Diversify Your Portfolio: Don‚Äôt put all your eggs in one basket. Diversification across different cryptocurrencies and asset classes can help mitigate risk. Long-Term Perspective: Cryptocurrency markets are volatile. If you believe in the long-term potential of Ethereum, consider a long-term investment strategy rather than trying to time short-term market fluctuations. Stay Informed: Keep up-to-date with the latest news and developments in the crypto space, including Ethereum and its competitors. Follow reputable sources and analysts to make informed decisions. Conclusion: Is Now the Time to Buy Ethereum? Qiao Wang‚Äôs assertion that Ethereum is oversold is a compelling signal in the current market. His historical comparisons and the context of broader market dynamics suggest a potential buying opportunity for those who believe in Ethereum‚Äôs long-term prospects. However, it‚Äôs crucial to remember that even if ETH is currently undervalued, the cryptocurrency market remains volatile and unpredictable. Wang‚Äôs own past decision to sell ETH and his views on layer-2 competition serve as important reminders of the evolving nature of the crypto landscape and the need for careful consideration of both opportunities and risks. Ultimately, whether now is the right time to buy Ethereum depends on your individual investment strategy, risk tolerance, and belief in its future. Wang‚Äôs analysis provides a valuable perspective, but informed decision-making requires thorough research and a nuanced understanding of the cryptocurrency market .

Loaded Lions (LION) surged 35.3% over the past day, reaching an intraday high of $0.0081 at the time of writing, while its market cap remained just shy of $187 million, approaching the $1 billion mark. The price gains came along with a jump in trading volume, which nearly doubled over the past day, hovering around $3.4 million.

LION price analysis Technical indicators indicate that LION could see more gains in the short term. On the 1-hour/WCRO chart, LION has recently broken above the ascending parallel channel pattern it had been trading within since March 6, a break above which suggests a very dominant bullish trend supported by the strong buying pressure from traders. LION price, Supertrend and Aroon chart ‚Äî March 13 | Source: crypto.news The Supertrend indicator has moved below the price in the green zone, showing a bullish trend. At the same time, the Aroon Up is at 100%, while Aroon Down is at 0%, confirming strong buying pressure and a steady uptrend. Hence, LION could continue rallying, with the next target at the key resistance level of $0.0085. If it breaks above that, it could attract more bullish interest, pushing the price toward $0.01. Community expectations for LION in the long term range between $0.1725 and $0.20 by the end of 2025. Some even believe that a breakout above this level could push the price as high as $0.50 over the long run. At press time, LION was exchanging hands at $0.0080 per coin.

According to a March 12 report from local media outlet P√°gina 12, attorney Gregorio Dalbon, known for having represented former Argentine president Cristina Fern√°ndez de Kirchner, filed the request with prosecutor Eduardo Taiano and Judge Mar√≠a Servini. For those unaware, an Interpol Red Notice is essentially a global alert requesting law enforcement agencies worldwide to locate and provisionally arrest someone. Similar notices have been asked for in high-profile crypto cases, including for Terraform Labs‚Äô Do Kwon. In court documents, Dalbon reasoned that Davis played a ‚Äúcentral role‚Äù in the creation and promotion of the LIBRA token and posed a ‚Äúprocedural risk‚Äù due to his financial resources, ‚Äúwhich could make it easier for him‚Äù to flee or go into hiding. LIBRA became a national controversy after Argentine President Javier Milei shared it on social media just minutes after its launch, fueling speculation that his endorsement contributed to its meteoric rise. However, the token‚Äôs price crashed soon after, wiping out $4.4 billion in market capitalization and leaving many investors with heavy losses .

Davis, for his part, resurfaced recently after weeks of silence, announcing that he has hired legal representation and plans to address the case. His legal team includes Brian Klein of Waymaker Law, a well-known firm that handles complex financial crime cases involving the SEC and the U.S. Justice Department. In a statement, Davis maintained his innocence , claiming he ‚Äúonly wanted and sought the success‚Äù of LIBRA and had no intent to defraud investors, the P√°gina 12 report added. Meanwhile, Milei has also denied any wrongdoing , insisting he merely ‚Äúspread the word‚Äù about the token rather than formally promoting it. As previously reported by crypto.news, last week, Taiano told local media that he intends to freeze roughly 110 million in assets as part of an ongoing investigation into Milei‚Äôs involvement in the LIBRA scandal.

Purchasing Bitcoin with a credit card is a beginner-friendly option for new cryptocurrency investors already familiar with using their credit cards for online transactions. There may be some protection from the credit card company if something goes awry. Will buying Bitcoin with a credit card affect my credit score? Every purchasing decision you make with your credit card will have an effect on your credit score, either positive or negative. Crypto is likely to do more harm than good to a credit score. Here‚Äôs why: Particularly with large Bitcoin purchases, it will increase your credit utilization ratio. Banks don‚Äôt reflect kindly to high credit utilization above 50% of a credit limit. Traditional banks and card issuers classify crypto purchases as cash advances and risky transactions. Payment history still remains the key factor in your credit score. Credit issuers may well frown upon regular Bitcoin purchases. Did you know? Over 85% of retailers across the world accept credit cards, while only 25% of online retailers accept crypto payments. Credit cards are still more widely accepted; however, crypto acceptance is growing quickly. Where to buy Bitcoin (BTC) with a credit card You could buy Bitcoin with credit cards on centralized crypto exchanges (CEXs) . Well-known global platforms like Coinbase, Kraken and Binance all enable their users to buy Bitcoin with a credit card. Adding to this, you can use instant buy features to purchase Bitcoin with a credit card without depositing fiat currency into your account first. However, the regional availability for CEXs varies from platform to platform. This is usually dependent on local regulations and compliance. So, before picking a platform, you should check if it operates in your location and with your card issuer. What if a credit card transaction is declined? Many traditional banks actively block crypto-related transactions, which means you might find your credit card declined when attempting to purchase Bitcoin or other cryptocurrencies. This is often due to the bank‚Äôs policy against facilitating cryptocurrency transactions. However, there is good news: Modern fintech banking alternatives, such as digital banks and crypto-friendly payment platforms, are increasingly supportive of cryptocurrency purchases, offering a smoother transaction experience. Aside from bank restrictions, other reasons for declined crypto transactions can include fraud prevention measures, where the transaction is flagged as suspicious. Additionally, exceeding your credit card‚Äôs spending limit or encountering issues with your card‚Äôs authorization settings can also lead to a declined transaction. Is there a limit to how much Bitcoin can be bought with a credit card? The purchase limit for Bitcoin varies for each individual and is influenced by two main factors. First, the spending limit on your credit card, which is determined by your bank or card issuer. Second, the crypto exchange you‚Äôre using will impose its own purchase limits. For first-time buyers, these limits can be relatively low ‚Äî often just a few hundred dollars. However, depending on the exchange and your account history, these limits can typically be increased to $5,000 or more per week if needed. You should also be aware of the credit card Bitcoin purchase fees that can include: Exchange fees: Typically 3%‚Äì5% for credit card purchases (this is higher than other methods, which can be as low as 0.1%). Card issuer fees: Some treat crypto purchases as cash advances. Foreign transaction fees: It may apply to fiat foreign currency transactions. Did you know? 8%‚Äì10% of the adult global population is thought to own cryptocurrency of some form in 2025. A huge jump from 1%‚Äì2% in 2018, highlighting the increasing adoption rate. How to buy Bitcoin on CEXs with a credit card Buying Bitcoin with a credit card is one of the quickest and easiest ways to make a purchase. Once you have a verified exchange account, you can make the transaction almost instantly. Below is a step-by-step guide on how to buy Bitcoin with a Visa or Mastercard on Coinbase. Steps on other exchanges may vary, but the process is generally very similar. Step 1: Create a verified account Follow the user-friendly sign-up process. Ensure to activate 2-factor authentication (2FA) to double-lock your account. During the sign-up process, you‚Äôll need to verify your identity. Crypto regulations in many countries require exchanges to comply with KYC and AML regulations. To pass these checks, you must upload a valid government ID (passport, driving license or any other acceptable ID card). Step 2: Link your credit card Once your account is accessible, use the right-hand side panel to add your payment method. This will give you the option to link a credit card. Add your card details and click ‚ÄúAdd Card.‚Äù Step 3: Buy Bitcoin Using the right-hand side panel instant buy feature, select Bitcoin and the amount you‚Äôd like to purchase. The exchange buy limit will also be shown next to your credit card payment method. This is usually limited to 10,000 British pounds daily on Coinbase. When ready, click ‚ÄúBuy Now.‚Äù Confirm the purchase on your banking app. Once approved, the Bitcoin will be added to your exchange account and fiat debited from your credit card. How to protect yourself from fraud when buying Bitcoin with a credit card The irreversible nature of Bitcoin means security and fraud prevention should be at the top of your list. It is your responsibility to protect your financial information and crypto from being compromised. To stay safe when buying Bitcoin, you should: Only use a reputable and regulated exchange with a strong security record. Use core security features, including unique passwords and 2FA. Watch out for phishing attempts . Double-check URLs, and don‚Äôt click email links or unsolicited messages. Consider moving Bitcoin into a self-custody hardware wallet to protect against exchange hacks and fraud. Is it safe to buy BTC with a credit card? It is generally considered that buying Bitcoin with a credit card is one of the safest methods. This is because it helps to protect your wider financial information, such as direct access to bank accounts. You can also benefit from fraud prevention and spending limits that credit card companies offer. So, if your card details or accounts fall into the wrong hands, you will have higher levels of protection. Plus, there is even some recourse to reverse payments and have fraudulent payments struck off. While it does offer added protection and convenience, purchases will come at a higher cost. Credit card companies typically charge higher fees for crypto transactions, and you may face restrictions on the size of Bitcoin purchases. Many exchanges impose lower purchase limits for credit card transactions, especially for first-time buyers, which could make it less appealing for larger investments. Despite these drawbacks, the extra protection and ease of use make it a convenient option for those new to the crypto space. This article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.

This request aims to have Davis located and detained globally, pending extradition from the United States. Dalb√≥n, known for representing former Argentine President Cristina Fern√°ndez de Kirchner, filed the petition alongside lead prosecutor Eduardo Taiano and Judge Mar√≠a Servini. The petition argues that Davis is a significant flight risk due to his financial resources and foreign residency. Local reports highlight that the scale of investor losses justifies immediate legal action. Meanwhile, LIBRA‚Äôs price continues to decline sharply amid growing fear and uncertainty. The bearish market conditions have only worsened the situation for retail investors who have already suffered significant losses. Blockchain analysis firm Nansen has reported that LIBRA insiders secured major profits , while ordinary investors faced staggering losses. Wallets linked to Davis and another key figure, Kelsier, managed to withdraw substantial amounts before the token collapsed. Blockchain investigators also found evidence of market manipulation tactics, such as automated bot purchases to control liquidity. Davis has acknowledged using such tactics but claimed they were meant to prevent an immediate crash and reinvest liquidity when Argentine President Javier Milei resumed promoting the token. However, this plan failed, leaving many retail investors at a loss while insiders profited. The controversy deepens as LIBRA‚Äôs team has been linked to other questionable crypto ventures, including MELANIA, another project accused of being a rug pull . Reports also suggest that LIBRA insiders were in discussions with officials from Nigeria to launch a similar token, raising concerns about repeated crypto-related schemes across multiple countries. Authorities in Argentina have already frozen millions of dollars in crypto tied to the scheme. The LIBRA scandal has also led to ripple effects within the broader cryptocurrency industry. Ben Chow, co-founder of the decentralized finance platform Meteora, recently resigned, further highlighting how deeply the issue has shaken the sector. If Interpol approves Dalb√≥n‚Äôs request for a Red Notice, Davis will be flagged as a wanted individual across 195 countries. While a Red Notice does not mandate immediate arrest, it serves as a warning to international law enforcement agencies that Davis is being pursued for extradition. As the situation unfolds, the LIBRA meme coin continues its steep decline, reflecting the damage caused by the scandal. Investors remain uncertain about potential legal resolutions, and the case continues to cast a shadow over Argentina‚Äôs political and financial landscape.",,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|REGULATION|MARKET|BLOCKCHAIN|TRADING,"{'name': 'Coinpaprika', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/80/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaprika,2025-03-13 07:45:07

The inflation index releases have left many surprised, as the general expectation was that the core inflation rate would drop from 3.3% to 3.2% and the inflation rate would decline from 3% to 2.9%. The development has triggered discussions on Fed rate cuts. Will the US Federal Reserve cut interest rates? Let‚Äôs analyse! US Inflation Falls Below Expectations Both the US Core Inflation rate and the Inflation rate declined in February, compared to January 2025. It is the first time since July 2024 that both of these indexes have simultaneously dropped. In July 2024, the core inflation slipped from 3.3% to 3.2%, and the inflation rate decreased from 3% to 2.9%. The consistent drop in inflation rates between January and July 2024 was one of the reasons that encouraged the Federal Reserve to announce a series of interest rate cuts post July. In September, for the first time since July 2023, the interest rate was lowered from 5.5% to 5%. In November, it was reduced from 5% to 4.75%. In December, it was lowered to 4.5% from 4.75%. Will the Fed Cut Interest Rates? Cooling inflation means there is a high chance of an interest rate cut in the US. According to reports, the possibility of a rate cut in May has grown from 10% to 31.4%, while the likelihood of a cut by year-end has increased from 6.5% to 32.5%. The chance of four rate cuts this year has surged from 1% to 21%. Bitcoin Drops Despite Positive Inflation News In the last 30 days, the Bitcoin price has dropped by 15.3%. In the last seven days alone, the price has slipped by 9.3%. Yesterday, the Bitcoin market rose from $82,914.61 to $83,660.58. Currently, the market stands at $83,165.61 ‚Äì at least 0.59% below yesterday‚Äôs closing price. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

41578954,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=139746,1741851958,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Landmark: Ripple Secures Dubai Crypto License for Regulated XRP Services ‚Äì A Game Changer?,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/ripple-secures-dubai-crypto-license/,"In a significant stride for the digital asset landscape, Ripple, the company renowned for its XRP cryptocurrency and blockchain-based payment solutions, has just announced a major victory. They‚Äôve clinched the coveted approval from the Dubai Financial Services Authority (DFSA) to offer regulated cryptocurrency services within the Dubai International Finance Centre (DIFC). This exciting development signals a substantial expansion of Ripple‚Äôs global footprint and opens up new avenues for businesses in the United Arab Emirates (UAE) to leverage cutting-edge crypto technologies. Let‚Äôs dive into what this groundbreaking news means for Ripple, the crypto world, and the future of digital payments in the region. Decoding the Ripple Dubai Approval: What Does DFSA Clearance Mean? Securing the DFSA approval isn‚Äôt just another feather in Ripple‚Äôs cap; it‚Äôs a powerful testament to their commitment to regulatory compliance and their vision for mainstream crypto adoption. The DFSA is the independent regulator of financial services conducted in or from the DIFC, a leading global financial hub. Obtaining their clearance is a rigorous process, demanding adherence to stringent standards of operation, security, and consumer protection. For Ripple, this Dubai crypto license signifies: Legitimacy and Trust: Operating under DFSA regulation provides a stamp of approval, enhancing trust and credibility among institutions and businesses in the UAE. Access to the DIFC Ecosystem: The DIFC is home to a vast network of international banks, financial institutions, and multinational corporations. This approval grants Ripple access to offer its services to these key players. Regulatory Clarity: Operating within a regulated framework provides clarity and legal certainty, crucial for businesses hesitant about venturing into the often-murky waters of cryptocurrency regulations. Expansion of Global Payments Product: This approval allows Ripple to extend its global payments product, leveraging XRP, to companies within the UAE, facilitating faster, cheaper, and more transparent cross-border transactions. Why is Dubai a Strategic Location for Ripple‚Äôs Crypto Expansion? Dubai, and the UAE as a whole, has emerged as a progressive hub for innovation and technology, particularly in the blockchain and cryptocurrency space. Choosing Dubai for this strategic expansion is a smart move by Ripple for several compelling reasons: Pro-Crypto Stance: The UAE government has demonstrated a forward-thinking approach to digital assets, actively seeking to create a conducive environment for crypto businesses to thrive. Financial Hub Status: Dubai‚Äôs DIFC is a globally recognized financial center, attracting significant international business and investment. This makes it an ideal launchpad for Ripple to further its institutional adoption goals. Gateway to the Middle East and Beyond: Dubai serves as a strategic gateway to the broader Middle East, Africa, and South Asia (MEASA) region, offering Ripple access to a vast and rapidly growing market. Talent and Infrastructure: Dubai boasts a skilled workforce, advanced infrastructure, and a strong technological ecosystem, providing a solid foundation for Ripple‚Äôs operations. Unpacking the Benefits of Ripple‚Äôs Regulated Crypto Services in the UAE The introduction of Ripple‚Äôs Dubai approval for regulated crypto services within the DIFC promises a range of benefits for businesses operating in the UAE. Let‚Äôs explore some key advantages: Benefit Description Faster Payments Leveraging XRP and Ripple‚Äôs technology can significantly reduce transaction settlement times compared to traditional banking systems, enabling near-instant cross-border payments. Lower Costs Traditional international payments often involve hefty fees and intermediary charges. Ripple‚Äôs solutions aim to minimize these costs, making cross-border transactions more affordable. Increased Transparency Blockchain technology provides enhanced transparency in payment processing, allowing for better tracking and auditability of transactions. Enhanced Efficiency Automated processes and reduced reliance on manual interventions streamline payment workflows, boosting operational efficiency for businesses. Regulatory Compliant Operations Operating under DFSA regulation ensures compliance with international standards, mitigating risks and fostering a secure environment for crypto transactions. Challenges and Considerations for Ripple‚Äôs UAE Venture While the DFSA crypto regulation approval is a major win, Ripple will still need to navigate certain challenges and considerations as they roll out their services in Dubai: Market Adoption: While Dubai is crypto-friendly, broader adoption of XRP and Ripple‚Äôs solutions will require ongoing education and outreach to businesses and financial institutions in the region. Competition: The crypto landscape is competitive, with various players offering cross-border payment solutions. Ripple will need to differentiate itself and demonstrate its unique value proposition. Regulatory Evolution: Crypto regulations are still evolving globally. Ripple will need to remain adaptable and compliant with any future regulatory changes in the UAE and internationally. XRP Price Volatility: Like many cryptocurrencies, XRP can experience price volatility, which might be a concern for some businesses using it for payments. However, Ripple‚Äôs solutions aim to mitigate this through efficient transaction processing. Examples of How Businesses Can Leverage Ripple‚Äôs Dubai Crypto Services Imagine a multinational corporation with its regional headquarters in Dubai. With XRP Dubai expansion , they can now utilize Ripple‚Äôs regulated services to: Streamline Payments to International Suppliers: Instead of relying on slow and expensive traditional wire transfers, they can use XRP-powered payments to quickly and cost-effectively pay suppliers across borders. Facilitate Faster Remittances: Businesses involved in remittances can offer faster and cheaper services to individuals sending money to and from the UAE. Optimize Treasury Operations: Companies can leverage XRP for efficient and transparent treasury management, moving funds between subsidiaries and accounts globally with greater speed and control.

These banks provide services such as custody, trading, and fiat-crypto conversions, making Europe the leading region for integrating cryptocurrency into traditional finance. The rise of crypto-friendly banks is largely due to the development of a solid regulatory framework. Countries such as Germany, Switzerland, Liechtenstein, and Lithuania have pioneered this movement, hosting well-known institutions like SEBA Bank, Bank Frick, and Revolut. These banks enable cryptocurrency transactions and offer secure storage, staking, and asset tokenization services. Compared to other regions, Europe is far ahead. In the United States, banks have only recently gained permission to engage with crypto-related services following the White House Crypto Summit . Meanwhile, Europe has already established regulations that encourage banks to participate in the sector. A major factor behind this growth is the Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA) framework , which creates clear regulations for banks and financial institutions dealing with cryptocurrencies. MiCA ensures a secure and transparent environment, helping service providers expand across borders while gaining reliable access to banking support. The legal clarity provided by MiCA has made it easier for banks to integrate crypto services, setting Europe apart from regions with uncertain regulations. Taking advantage of these progressive laws, countries like Germany , Switzerland, and Malta have also introduced favorable tax policies. For example, Germany applies a 0% tax on long-term crypto profits, making it an attractive destination for investors. Digital banks, including Revolut, N26, and Fidor , have quickly embraced cryptocurrency services, appealing to modern customers seeking seamless digital finance solutions. These neobanks are often more agile than traditional U.S. banks, which remain cautious due to stricter regulations. Despite its leadership, Europe faces challenges such as price volatility, fraud risks, and strict Anti-Money Laundering (AML) and Know-Your-Customer (KYC) regulations. These obstacles require constant regulatory adjustments to ensure security while maintaining growth. With MiCA set to take full effect soon, Europe is likely to maintain its dominant position. However, growing regulations in Asia could introduce competition. To remain the leader in crypto-friendly banking, Europe must continue refining its policies and addressing emerging risks in the digital finance landscape.",,EN,0,0,REGULATION|ASIA|FIAT|TRADING|BUSINESS,"{'name': 'Coinpaprika', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/80/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaprika,2025-03-13 07:48:03

Recent insights from legal expert Fred Rispoli suggest that the resolution may be closer than expected. As the market eagerly awaits the resolution of the Ripple-SEC case, Rispoli‚Äôs comments have sparked widespread speculation regarding the potential outcomes. XRP Lawsuit: Why the SEC‚Äôs Delay Isn‚Äôt a Pivotal Issue? Lawyer Fred Rispoli is downplaying the role of the US Securities and Exchange Commission‚Äôs (SEC) delay in resolving the XRP lawsuit. Despite many considering the delay a major obstacle, Rispoli believes the case‚Äôs resolution is simpler than anticipated. Rispoli stated , ‚ÄúI just don‚Äôt see this being the big issue some are making it out to be‚Ä¶it‚Äôs unorthodox, but not difficult.‚Äù Significantly, Rispoli‚Äôs comments suggest that the SEC‚Äôs delay may not be a critical factor in the XRP lawsuit as many believe. He urges the community to shift the focus from the delay to the potential outcomes and implications of the lawsuit‚Äôs resolution. Previously, Rispoli dismissed discussions surrounding the SEC‚Äôs delay, deeming them unnecessary. He also addressed the SEC‚Äôs excuses as cowardly. Key Considerations Regarding Torres‚Äô Order: Lawyer‚Äôs Insights According to lawyer Fred Rispoli, the delay in the Ripple-SEC case isn‚Äôt a significant issue. This sentiment is echoed in his statement that the SEC will handle Judge Torres‚Äô enforcement order, not the judge herself. In addition, Rispoli shared insights on the Ripple and SEC‚Äôs possible move to jointly file a motion to vacate the judgment. The lawyer deems this as the ‚Äúcleanest way‚Äù to dismiss the XRP lawsuit. This approach involves the SEC and Ripple agreeing to vacate the judgment in exchange for Ripple dropping its appeal. Recently, an XRP advocacy platform, All Things XRP, shared five possible outcomes of the Ripple lawsuit. The potential outcomes include withdrawal of the SEC‚Äôs appeal, reduction of Ripple‚Äôs penalty, reversal of the court decision, lifting of the injunction, and complete closure of the case by the SEC. SEC‚Äôs Flexibility in Resolving Ripple Case Further, Rispoli shed light on the SEC‚Äôs flexibility to resolve the XRP lawsuit without vacating the order. The regulator can bypass vacating the order by drafting a settlement agreement with Ripple, agreeing not to enforce the judgment in exchange for Ripple dropping its appeal. Interestingly, the SEC Enforcement Manual prioritizes cooperation and settlement over litigation. This provides a framework for the regulator‚Äôs actions. However, the agency has historically exercised its discretion, sometimes bypassing due process. In this case, the agency‚Äôs flexibility could facilitate a fair outcome for the Ripple lawsuit, stated Rispoli. Rispoli‚Äôs comment comes in response to Fox Business journalist Eleanor Terrett‚Äôs report on an imminent XRP lawsuit settlement.

This transition has led to increased selling pressure, reflecting a shift in investor sentiment toward caution. Many market participants are now prioritizing liquidation over adding to their holdings, leading to downward pressure on Bitcoin's price. Recent data indicates that Bitcoin‚Äôs price structure has entered a phase typically seen after all-time highs. This phase follows the natural cycle of accumulation and distribution, where investors adjust their positions based on market trends. The latest distribution phase began in early 2025, coinciding with Bitcoin‚Äôs sharp correction. Investor activity further confirms this shift. All wallet size categories have contributed to the increased selling pressure , indicating that both large and small holders are actively reducing their positions. The impact of this trend has been particularly noticeable since mid-January, with a growing number of investors selling their assets at a loss, intensifying the market downturn. Market sentiment has also changed significantly. As uncertainty rises, investors have become more hesitant to increase their positions. Macroeconomic factors, including financial instability and trade tensions, have contributed to this cautious outlook. Earlier in the cycle, investors were actively buying Bitcoin during price pullbacks , expecting a continued uptrend. However, as liquidity tightened and risks increased, confidence in further accumulation declined. The lack of buying activity at lower levels suggests a capital rotation is taking place , leading to the possibility of a prolonged consolidation phase before the market finds stable ground. This means that Bitcoin could continue fluctuating until a strong support level is established. Despite these concerns, some analysts believe there are signs of stabilization. Observers have noted that the largest Bitcoin distribution by long-term holders in recent years appears to be tapering off. Selling activity from long-term holders has slowed , indicating a possible return to confidence among experienced investors. If this trend continues, it could lead to reduced market supply and potential stabilization. Bitcoin‚Äôs price remains volatile, with fluctuations driven by external economic and geopolitical factors. While the market faces uncertainty, signs of reduced selling pressure may suggest a possible shift in momentum .

The apex bank seeks to establish standards for crypto-related services, boost market transparency, and expand investment opportunities for high-net-worth investors. 3-Year Experimental Regime For Crypto Investment In Russia On March 12, the Bank of Russia proposed allowing a ‚Äúlimited circle of Russian investors‚Äù to trade cryptocurrencies. The bank emphasized that the proposal is based on a directive from Russia‚Äôs president Vladimir Putin. ‚ÄúIn accordance with the instructions of the President of Russia, the Bank of Russia has sent proposals to the government for discussion on regulating investments in cryptocurrencies,‚Äù the announcement stated. A statement by the central bank says the plan would introduce an experimental legal regime lasting three years in which qualified investors would be allowed to conduct crypto transactions. Investors who wish to participate in the experimental framework must have over 100 million rubles ($1.14 million) in investments or an annual income of over 50 million rubles ($570,000). Notably, eligibility also extends to institutions that have already satisfied existing qualification standards under the current framework. The Bank of Russia‚Äôs rationale for introducing the new crypto program for select investors came from efforts to establish standards for crypto-related services and increase market transparency while expanding investment opportunities for ‚Äúexperienced investors willing to assume higher risks.‚Äù Bank Of Russia Maintains Ban On Retail Crypto Payments The Bank of Russia reiterated its warnings about the inherent volatility and risks of investing in cryptocurrencies, stressing that any jurisdiction does not guarantee these assets. ‚ÄúTherefore, investors, when deciding to invest in cryptocurrency, should be aware that they are taking on the risks of potential loss of their funds,‚Äù the bank added. Despite the proposal, the Bank of Russia noted that cryptocurrency transactions between residents outside the experimental legal regime are banned. The bank suggested enforcing penalties for violations of the experimental regime. Nonetheless, the move marks Russia‚Äôs latest foray into the crypto space. Last year, the country‚Äôs lower house of the Federal Assembly, known as the State Duma, passed two bills legalizing cryptocurrency mining and enforcing another experimental regime on cross-border settlements and foreign trading in crypto.",Cryptocurrency|News|Cryptocurrency News|Russia,EN,0,0,FIAT|BUSINESS|REGULATION|BTC|MARKET,"{'name': 'ZyCrypto', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/zycrypto.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",zycrypto,2025-03-13 07:53:15

Despite this significant move, Solana‚Äôs price and demand have remained largely unaffected. The crypto market‚Äôs overall bearish sentiment appears to overshadow the potential impact of these token shifts. On-chain data reveals that Alameda‚Äôs unstaked tokens were distributed among 38 wallets linked to FTX , continuing a pattern seen in previous asset transfers by the trading firm. Since its collapse, Alameda has frequently moved substantial amounts of various cryptocurrencies, often influencing prices. However, in this case, Solana‚Äôs price remained stable despite the movement of a large token supply. This stands in contrast to past events where Alameda‚Äôs asset transfers caused noticeable price fluctuations. For example, when the firm moved Ethereum earlier in 2024, ETH experienced a double-digit price jump. Yet, this latest Solana transaction had minimal impact on market dynamics, even as Solana briefly declined and then spiked before the announcement was made. The exact purpose behind these token transfers remains unclear. However, speculation suggests that Alameda may be reallocating assets as part of FTX‚Äôs ongoing reimbursement efforts . Last month, FTX began its first phase of creditor repayments, and earlier this month, the exchange unlocked another massive batch of Solana tokens. If Alameda‚Äôs transfers are connected to this process, they could play a role in restoring funds to affected users. Despite these movements, Solana‚Äôs demand is not expected to shift significantly. The broader crypto market is experiencing extreme fear, leading to substantial outflows from major assets. In this environment, Alameda‚Äôs actions represent just a small fraction of the overall market activity. While the situation continues to unfold, investors are closely watching for any further developments that could influence Solana‚Äôs price and demand. For now, it appears that market conditions and regulatory decisions will have a much larger effect on Solana than Alameda‚Äôs token transfers.",,EN,0,0,SOL|MARKET|TRADING|ETH|BUSINESS,"{'name': 'Coinpaprika', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/80/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaprika,2025-03-13 07:53:50

Dalbon has formally requested an Interpol Red Notice, which would help locate and detain Davis in the U.S. before extraditing him to Argentina. He argues that Davis played a key role in the scandal and could flee due to his wealth and overseas residence.

However, the hype was short-lived, as the token‚Äôs value crashed within hours, wiping out millions in investor funds. The controversy didn‚Äôt just hit traders‚Äîit also put Milei‚Äôs administration under fire, with critics questioning whether he was part of the scheme or simply misled. Legal Battle Heats Up Dalbon, who has a history of high-profile cases, filed his request with Argentine prosecutor Eduardo Taiano and Judge Mar√≠a Servini. According to local media reports , he stressed Davis‚Äôs involvement in creating and promoting LIBRA, arguing that his freedom posed a serious risk. He accuses him of playing a key role in the scandal that caused massive losses for investors. He even argued in the filing that Davis posed a ‚Äúprocedural risk‚Äù if he is allowed to move freely, with huge financial backing, he could easily escape to the U.S. or go into hiding. Meanwhile, authorities have already taken action to freeze $100 million in crypto linked to the case.

However, it‚Äôs important to note that a Red Notice is not an automatic arrest warrant‚Äîeach country decides whether to act based on its own laws. What‚Äôs Next? The LIBRA scandal has rocked Argentina‚Äôs financial and political landscape. Investors lost millions, and the government is facing backlash over its handling of the situation. If Davis is arrested and extradited, it could mark a major step in holding those responsible accountable.

41579391,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=139700,1741852503,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Revealing Insights: Tether CEO Reflects on Navigating US Crypto Regulation Challenges,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/tether-ceo-crypto-regulation-challenges/,"In a candid address at the Cantor Global Technology Conference in New York, Tether‚Äôs CEO, Paolo Ardoino, offered a compelling reflection on the stablecoin giant‚Äôs arduous journey. Describing Tether‚Äôs experiences as going ‚Äúthrough hell,‚Äù as reported by CoinDesk, Ardoino‚Äôs words painted a vivid picture of the intense pressures and scrutiny faced by the leading stablecoin issuer, particularly from U.S. authorities. But what exactly are these challenges, and how has Tether navigated the complex landscape of crypto regulation ? Navigating the Labyrinth: Tether‚Äôs Crypto Challenges Under US Regulation Ardoino‚Äôs remarks shed light on the significant headwinds Tether encountered, primarily stemming from the watchful eyes of U.S. regulatory bodies. For years, Tether , the issuer of USDT, has operated under a cloud of skepticism and intense examination. This scrutiny wasn‚Äôt unfounded; the world of stablecoins, designed to maintain a steady value, was relatively new, and its potential impact on the broader financial system was still being understood. Let‚Äôs break down some key aspects of these crypto challenges : Regulatory Scrutiny: From its inception, Tether faced questions about the actual reserves backing its USDT stablecoin. Concerns were raised about whether each USDT was truly backed 1:1 by U.S. dollars or equivalent reserves, as initially claimed. This lack of transparency became a major point of contention with regulators. Legal Battles and Settlements: The pressure culminated in formal investigations and legal actions. Notably, Tether reached settlements with both the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) and the New York State Department of Financial Services (NYDFS) in 2021. These settlements, while resolving specific issues, came with financial penalties and mandates for increased transparency and compliance. Maintaining Stability Amidst Volatility: Beyond regulatory hurdles, Tether also faced the inherent challenge of maintaining USDT‚Äôs peg to the US dollar in the volatile cryptocurrency market. Market fluctuations, especially during periods of high stress, can test the resilience of any stablecoin. Despite these formidable Tether challenges , Ardoino‚Äôs address suggests a turning tide. The settlements with the CFTC and NYDFS, while undoubtedly painful, have arguably paved the way for a more constructive relationship with U.S. regulators. Has Tether successfully weathered the storm and emerged stronger? From Scrutiny to Stability? Understanding US Regulation and Tether‚Äôs Evolution The settlements with the CFTC and NYDFS marked a significant juncture for Tether. These agreements required Tether to pay fines and, more importantly, to enhance its transparency and reporting practices. This shift towards greater openness is crucial for building trust and fostering a more positive regulatory environment. Here‚Äôs a closer look at the impact of US regulation on Tether: Regulatory Body Settlement Outcome Key Impact on Tether Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) $41 million penalty Settlement of charges related to untrue or misleading statements and unlawful off-exchange retail commodity transactions. New York State Department of Financial Services (NYDFS) $18.5 million penalty Settlement related to misrepresentations regarding USDT backing and concealment of losses. Required enhanced reporting and compliance measures. These settlements, while costly, can be viewed as a necessary step in Tether ‚Äòs maturation. By addressing past concerns and committing to greater transparency, Tether is signaling its intent to operate within the bounds of US regulation and build a sustainable future. This evolution is vital not only for Tether but also for the broader stablecoin ecosystem. USDT‚Äôs Reign: Dominance in the Stablecoin Market Despite the regulatory battles and operational hurdles, USDT has not only survived but thrived. Data from DefiLlama underscores USDT‚Äôs undisputed dominance in the stablecoin market . With a staggering market capitalization of $143.5 billion, USDT commands a 63% share of the total stablecoin market cap, which stands at $227.7 billion. This dominance speaks volumes about USDT‚Äôs utility and the market‚Äôs reliance on it as a key instrument in cryptocurrency trading and DeFi (Decentralized Finance). Why does USDT hold such a commanding position in the stablecoin market ? Several factors contribute to its enduring popularity: First-MMover Advantage: USDT was one of the earliest stablecoins, establishing a significant network effect and becoming deeply integrated into crypto exchanges and trading platforms. Liquidity and Accessibility: USDT boasts unparalleled liquidity across numerous exchanges, making it easily accessible for traders worldwide. Its widespread adoption makes it a convenient on-ramp and off-ramp for fiat currencies in the crypto space. Market Familiarity: Years of usage have ingrained USDT into the habits of crypto traders and investors. Despite controversies, its familiarity and ubiquity contribute to its continued preference. However, the stablecoin market is becoming increasingly competitive. Rivals like USDC, backed by Coinbase and Circle, are gaining ground, emphasizing regulatory compliance and transparency as core values. Will USDT be able to maintain its dominant position in the face of rising competition and evolving regulatory landscapes? The Road Ahead: What‚Äôs Next for Tether and the Stablecoin Ecosystem? Paolo Ardoino‚Äôs reflection at the Cantor Global Technology Conference offers a glimpse into Tether‚Äôs past, present, and potentially its future. The journey has been fraught with crypto challenges , particularly concerning US regulation . However, the settlements and the continued market dominance of USDT suggest a degree of resilience and adaptation. Looking ahead, several key factors will shape Tether‚Äôs trajectory and the broader stablecoin market : Evolving Regulation: The regulatory landscape for stablecoins is still in flux globally, especially in the US and Europe. Future regulations could significantly impact how stablecoins operate and are governed. Tether‚Äôs ability to proactively adapt to these changes will be crucial. Transparency and Trust: Continued commitment to transparency regarding reserves and operations will be essential for building and maintaining trust, both with regulators and the market. Competition from Rivals: The rise of competing stablecoins, particularly those emphasizing regulatory compliance, poses a significant challenge to USDT‚Äôs dominance. Innovation and differentiation will be key for Tether to stay ahead. Tether‚Äôs story is a microcosm of the broader cryptocurrency industry‚Äôs journey ‚Äì marked by innovation, rapid growth, regulatory scrutiny, and constant evolution. As the leading stablecoin , Tether‚Äôs future path will undoubtedly have a significant impact on the entire crypto ecosystem.

The malware, including a package called BeaverTail, disguises itself as legitimate JavaScript libraries using typosquatting, where attackers slightly alter the names of trusted software to trick developers into downloading it. It primarily targets stored credentials in Chrome, Brave, and Firefox browsers, as well as Solana and Exodus wallets. Additionally, the group has been trying to trick crypto founders by using fake Zoom calls. Hackers pose as venture capitalists and send fake meeting links, claiming audio issues.

The price could hit a high of $3.99 in 2025. XRP Price Today: XRP value has gained 3.33% in 24-hours to $2.22. Ripple‚Äôs XRP finally neared the long-awaited $3 mark after President Donald Trump announced a new U.S. strategic crypto reserve that will include XRP and other digital assets. XRP price is currently up 3.33% to $2.22. If the bullish momentum sustains, XRP could aim at its next resistance levels at $2.31. On the flip side, if it loses out on steam, XRP price will remain range bound between its key support levels at $2.14 and $2.12. Our XRP price prediction will explore the potential answers to questions such as ‚ÄúWill XRP reach $10 in 2025?‚Äù by providing short term and long-term Ripple (XRP) price prediction. Overview Cryptocurrency XRP Token XRP Price $2.46 Market Cap $141.02 billion Trading Volume $14.24 billion Circulating Supply 57.94 billion XRP All-time High $3.84 Jan 04, 2018 All-time Low $0.002802 Jul 07, 2014 24-hour high $2.95 24-hour low $2.43 XRP Price Prediction 2025 The main factor that will decide XRP‚Äôs trend in 2025 is the conclusion of the Ripple vs SEC lawsuit . Which is expected to conclude on the 16th of April. This could finally materialize as, both Ripple Labs and the U.S. SEC are now keen on closing the case. There is more positive news for Ripple, as Franklin Templeton has announced filing for an XRP ETF. Once launched, it is expected to be listed on Cboe BZX Exchange. Moreover, Ripple has received approval from the Dubai Financial Services Authority (DFSA) to offer regulated crypto payments in the Dubai International Finance Centre (DIFC). The exchange inflow vs outflow graph from March 1st to March 11th, shows 501k outflows in comparison to 482k inflows. This signals a spike in strong investor interest, which is a big thumbs up for XRP. XRP Exchange Inflow vs Outflow If things go in favor of Ripple, XRP price could surge to a maximum of $5.81 by the end of 2025. In contrast, if the lawsuit continues, XRP could remain under a narrow range with a potential low of $2.3. That being said, we can expect an average price of $4.89. Year Potential Low Potential Average Potential High 2025 $2.3 $4.89 $5.81 Ripple (XRP) Price Prediction 2026 ‚Äì 2030 Year Potential Low ($) Potential Average ($) Potential High ($) 2026 5.6 6.25 8.64 2027 7.15 8.89 12.25 2028 11.3 14.11 16.53 2029 13.98 16.48 21.12 2030 16.92 19.87 26.97 XRP Price Prediction 2026 XRP price will likely witness a strong growth in 2026. There is a possibility that XRP can break through the $8.64 level and hold the price by the end of 2026. The minimum XRP price will be around $5.6, with an average trading price of $6.25. This could be a result of Ripple‚Äôs role in CBDC development and XRP‚Äôs rising institutional demand. XRP Price Prediction 2027 By 2027, market analysts and experts predict that XRP‚Äôs price will range between $7.15 to $12.25. XRP price might record an average level of $8.89. The reason behind this surge could be due to Ripple‚Äôs increasing domination in the payment sector, accelerating XRP‚Äôs buying demand and utility. XRP Price Prediction 2028 In 2028, Ripple could increase its use cases, including new dApps and announcements regarding XRP. This might boost the dominance of XRP as the second largest altcoin by market cap. We expect the XRP price to range between $11.3 to $16.53. The average trading price could be around $14.11. XRP Price Prediction 2029 Partnerships with multiple governments and wider adoption might strengthen XRP‚Äôs price in 2029. The altcoin might record a trading range between $13.98 to $21.12, with an average price of $16.48. XRP Price Prediction 2030 The long-term XRP price prediction depends on Ripple‚Äôs ability to expand its offerings across the crypto market. If everything remains positive, XRP price could scale between $16.92 to $26.97. With that price range, the average tag could be at $19.87. Ripple (XRP) Price Projection 2031, 2032, 2033, 2040, 2050 Based on historic price sentiments and XRP‚Äôs rising popularity, here are the long-term XRP price projections for 2031, 2032, 2033, 2040 and 2050.

Imagine an investment that shields you from fluctuations in the next market boom. Will you take it? That‚Äôs exactly what FXGuys ($FXG) gives you despite being in beta. While Solana (SOL) and Sui (SUI) struggle with price tension, FXGuys dominates with its Trader Funding Program, staking model, and Trade2Earn incentives. These features attract all traders looking for lucrative opportunities in the coming market boom. Therefore, its $FXG token is one of the best altcoins to buy in 2025! >>>JOIN FXGUYS HERE FXGuys Outpaces Solana as Investors Target Better Stability Solana is preparing for two major updates that will boost the long-term sustainability of its network. Known as SIMDs 0123 and SIMDs 0228, the proposals focus on regulating reward distribution and managing inflation. The expected changes could have a massive impact on validators and stakeholders within the network, causing SOL price tensions. On the other hand, FTX and Alameda unstaked and distributed 3.03 million SOL , worth $432.5 million, to 37 wallets, possibly indicating deposits to Binance and Coinbase exchanges. This move marks the largest unstaking since November 2023 and is part of 11.2 million SOL set for unlocking in early March 2025. Nevertheless, SOL traded at $147.46 on March 6, 2025, after a 5.88% rise in the last week. FXGuys has dominated Solana with its Trader Funding Program, Trade2Earn model, and high-yield staking, offering unrivaled financial benefits, passive income, and incentivized trading rewards. Investors Move from Sui to FXGuys for Increased Crypto Trading Rewards and Growth Sui has thrived in crypto trading because investors consider it a long-term investment due to its strong Layer 1 blockchain features with enhanced security. Also, the Sui network has an object-focused data model and massive scalability. Despite having a bullish potential and a potential 30% rally, investors are moving to other lucrative assets. Recently, SUI recorded a sharp decline, but investors are rushing to buy the dip, which will help to stabilize the token above its $2.45 support level. For context, SUI was valued at $2.87 on March 6, 2025, down 0.81% in the past week. While Sui remains competitive, investors are worried about the increasing price tension amid market volatility. FXGuys outshines Sui by blending trader funding, Trade2Earn rewards, and high-yield staking, offering real-world financial benefits, unmatched liquidity, and passive income. FXGuys: The New Crypto Project Revolutionizing Trading with Passive Income Opportunities Although Solana and Sui have dominated crypto trading markets for several years, increased volatility and sharp market declines have made investors reconsider their long-term investment strategy. Amid the increased market fluctuations, FXGuys has emerged as a dominant player for investors to consider in the next market boom. The new crypto trading platform offers users instant, real-world financial benefits despite only having a BETA platform and being in its public presale phase. FX Guys has features like the Trader Funding Program, staking model, and Trade2Earn incentives, which attract investors. The FXGuys Trader Funding Program caters to talented and skilled investors who lack the capital to invest in the market. It offers them up to $500,000 in trading capital, which is a unique offering in the whole crypto space. Analysts say the program makes $FXG one of the best altcoins to buy, helping increase investments from retail and institutional investors. Additionally, the FX Guys staking model means significant profits for the whole crypto industry. $FXG token holders get impressive staking rewards (up to a 20% APY) and a revenue share from the platform‚Äôs trading volume and fees. Thus, the investment strategy guarantees a constant flow of passive income for investors. Analysts say the FX Guys Trade2Earn program will change the whole crypto sector since it allows traders to earn $FXG tokens for all executed trades. This strategy enhances liquidity on FX Guys, and the rewards encourage traders to maintain continuous market activity. With the FXGuys BETA trading platform available for anyone seeking a free trial, market experts believe it will accelerate the rate of $FXG adoption. >>>JOIN FXGUYS HERE $FXG Thrives in Its Presale as Investors Seek Profitable Opportunities in a Volatile Market Investors want to maximize their earnings in the next crypto trading market boom as volatility increases. While Solana and Sui struggle with price tensions, FXGuys has stolen the spotlight with its appealing features and growth potential. FXGuys is increasing profitability for traders due to its many remarkable features and trading rewards. On that note, $FXG has become one of the best altcoins to buy, which has attracted many investors looking for more than the usual market speculation. Currently, at $0.05 in Stage 3 of its public presale stage, analysts say it is a cheap buy due to its profit prospects.

While five states have dismissed the idea, 18 others continue to explore ways to integrate Bitcoin into their financial systems. Garcia believes that Bitcoin reserves could drive innovation, improve investment frameworks, and enhance financial transparency. He emphasized that many citizens remain skeptical about tax money funding crypto purchases , arguing that states must educate the public on the broader economic benefits of Bitcoin in reserve portfolios. The executive also pointed out that the blockchain industry must demonstrate real-world value beyond speculation. He urged crypto firms to develop solutions that address practical issues, making it harder for lawmakers to ignore their benefits. VeChain‚Äôs blockchain-based sustainability verification was cited as an example of how decentralized technology can tackle pressing global challenges. Despite recent state-level rejections, Garcia cautioned against interpreting these decisions as widespread opposition to Bitcoin reserves. He highlighted that several states rejected the bills by narrow margins, suggesting that further discussion and education could shift opinions in the future. As the debate continues at the state level, momentum is also building on a national scale. Senator Lummis has reintroduced the BITCOIN Act, aiming to establish a US Strategic Bitcoin Reserve , backed by a significant BTC acquisition over five years. Originally proposed in 2024, the bill failed to pass, but recent policy shifts and executive orders suggest renewed interest in integrating Bitcoin into national financial strategies. While the future of Bitcoin reserves remains uncertain, increasing public awareness and addressing legislative concerns could play a crucial role in shaping the next phase of digital asset adoption. With growing interest in blockchain‚Äôs real-world applications, the conversation around Bitcoin as a reserve asset is far from over.",,EN,0,0,BTC|FIAT|BLOCKCHAIN|REGULATION|TECHNOLOGY,"{'name': 'Coinpaprika', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/80/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaprika,2025-03-13 07:58:08

Think of it as a significant power-up for digital freedom! This latest decision involves a substantial crypto funding injection of $4.8 million, building upon an initial investment and highlighting GnosisDAO‚Äôs belief in the future of secure, private internet access. But what exactly does this mean for you, the crypto enthusiast, and the wider digital world? Let‚Äôs dive into the details of this exciting development. Why is GnosisDAO Doubling Down on VPN Development? GnosisDAO isn‚Äôt new to the world of decentralized technologies. Known for its innovative approach and contributions to the blockchain space, GnosisDAO‚Äôs increased investment in VPN development speaks volumes about the growing importance of online privacy. In an age where data breaches and surveillance are increasingly common concerns, the need for robust and user-centric VPN solutions has never been greater. This isn‚Äôt just about hiding your browsing history; it‚Äôs about reclaiming digital sovereignty and ensuring a more secure and open internet for everyone. Here‚Äôs a breakdown of why this investment is a big deal: Privacy is Paramount: With increasing online surveillance and data collection, users are actively seeking tools to protect their digital footprint. A decentralized VPN offers a compelling alternative to traditional VPN services, promising greater transparency and control. Decentralization as a Core Value: GnosisDAO operates on the principles of decentralization. Extending this ethos to VPN technology aligns perfectly with their mission to build a more distributed and resilient digital ecosystem. Synergy with HOPR: The collaboration with HOPR, a leading mixnet developer, brings specialized expertise to the project. HOPR‚Äôs focus on metadata privacy complements GnosisDAO‚Äôs vision for a comprehensive decentralized solution. Long-Term Vision: This isn‚Äôt a short-sighted venture. The additional funding demonstrates GnosisDAO‚Äôs long-term commitment to establishing a viable and impactful decentralized VPN solution within the crypto space and beyond. The Journey So Far: From Seed Funding to Substantial Investment The Gnosis VPN project isn‚Äôt starting from scratch. It began in 2024 with an initial seed investment of $1.5 million from GnosisDAO. This initial capital injection was crucial in laying the groundwork and producing a proof of concept for the Gnosis VPN. Think of it as the initial spark that ignited a promising fire. This early phase allowed the teams at Gnosis and HOPR to: Validate the Concept: Prove the feasibility of a decentralized VPN solution within the Gnosis ecosystem. Establish Collaboration: Forge a strong working relationship between GnosisDAO and HOPR developers. Develop a Proof of Concept: Create a functional prototype to showcase the potential of the Gnosis VPN. The success of this initial phase has paved the way for the much larger $4.8 million investment. This significant increase in crypto funding is a testament to the project‚Äôs early promise and GnosisDAO‚Äôs confidence in its future impact. What Will the New Funding Actually Be Used For? So, where exactly will this $4.8 million go? It‚Äôs not just about throwing money at a problem; it‚Äôs about strategic allocation to ensure maximum impact. The funds are earmarked for several key areas crucial to the successful development and launch of the Gnosis VPN: Technical Research: Deeper exploration into advanced VPN technologies, protocol optimizations, and security enhancements. This ensures the Gnosis VPN is not just functional but also cutting-edge and resilient against evolving threats. User Onboarding Solutions: Making the VPN accessible and user-friendly is paramount for widespread adoption. A portion of the funding will focus on developing intuitive interfaces and streamlined onboarding processes, ensuring even non-technical users can easily benefit from decentralized privacy. HOPR Network Expansion: A robust and geographically diverse network is essential for a high-performance VPN. Expanding the HOPR Network infrastructure will improve speed, reliability, and global coverage of the Gnosis VPN. Furthermore, the agreement includes a strategic element that benefits GnosisDAO in the long run. Gnosis has secured the right to purchase HOPR tokens at a 30% discounted price. This not only represents a potential financial upside but also further aligns the incentives of both GnosisDAO and the HOPR Network , fostering a stronger and more collaborative partnership. Benefits of a Decentralized VPN: Why Should You Care? You might be wondering, ‚ÄúWhy should I care about a decentralized VPN?‚Äù Good question! The traditional VPN market is already quite saturated. However, decentralized VPNs offer some unique and compelling advantages, particularly for those invested in the crypto and Web3 space: Feature Traditional VPN Decentralized VPN (like Gnosis VPN) Transparency Often opaque, with limited insight into server infrastructure and data handling. Built on open-source principles, with greater transparency in network operations and data flows. Censorship Resistance Centralized infrastructure can be targeted by authorities for censorship or shutdown. Distributed nature makes it significantly harder to censor or shut down the entire network. Data Privacy Reliance on a single entity that controls servers and potentially user data. Data is distributed across a network, reducing the risk of centralized data breaches and single points of failure. Trust Model Requires trust in the VPN provider‚Äôs claims about privacy and security. Trust is distributed across the network and verifiable through blockchain and cryptographic principles. Economic Incentives Users pay subscription fees to a centralized provider. Potentially integrates crypto-economic models to incentivize node operators and reward users, creating a more sustainable and community-driven ecosystem. For crypto users, who often prioritize decentralization and privacy in their financial activities, a decentralized VPN like the Gnosis VPN could become an indispensable tool. It aligns with the core values of the crypto space and offers a more robust and resilient approach to online privacy. Challenges Ahead for Gnosis VPN Development While the future looks bright for Gnosis VPN, it‚Äôs important to acknowledge the challenges that lie ahead in its VPN development journey. Building a successful decentralized VPN is not without its hurdles: Scalability: Ensuring the VPN can handle a large number of users and maintain high speeds is a significant technical challenge. Decentralized networks can sometimes face scalability limitations compared to centralized systems. Performance Optimization: Balancing decentralization with optimal VPN performance (speed, latency) requires careful engineering and ongoing optimization. User Education and Adoption: Educating users about the benefits of decentralized VPNs and encouraging adoption will be crucial for the project‚Äôs success. Many users are already familiar with traditional VPNs, so highlighting the unique advantages of a decentralized approach is key. Regulatory Landscape: The regulatory environment surrounding VPNs and decentralized technologies is constantly evolving. Navigating these complexities and ensuring compliance will be an ongoing consideration. However, with the substantial crypto funding now secured and the expertise of both GnosisDAO and HOPR teams, the project is well-positioned to tackle these challenges head-on. The Bottom Line: A Powerful Step Towards Decentralized Privacy GnosisDAO‚Äôs $4.8 million investment in Gnosis VPN development is more than just a financial transaction; it‚Äôs a bold statement about the future of online privacy and the power of decentralized technologies. By doubling down on this project, GnosisDAO is not only contributing to the growth of the HOPR Network and the broader decentralized ecosystem but also taking a significant step towards empowering individuals with greater control over their digital lives. As the project progresses, it will be fascinating to watch how Gnosis VPN shapes the landscape of online privacy and sets a new standard for decentralized solutions in the crypto world and beyond.

Although the cryptocurrency remains below $85,000, it has recorded a 2.6% increase, with its price currently at $83,510. Despite this short-term uptick, Bitcoin is still down by roughly 7.5% over the past week, reflecting a continued downtrend. Regardless of¬†Bitcoin‚Äôs price struggles to regain higher levels, CryptoQuant analyst Avocado Onchain has identified a notable trend in BTC mining activity. Related Reading: Bitcoin‚Äôs SOPR Nears Critical Level‚ÄîIs a Deeper Correction Ahead? Rising Bitcoin Mining Difficulty and Miner Holding Strategy According to Avocado Onchain, Bitcoin‚Äôs mining difficulty has remained in an uptrend even as the market undergoes a 30% correction. The analyst wrote: During the extended correction phase that began in March 2024, mining difficulty saw a temporary drop, leading some to speculate that it resembled the end of the 2021 cycle. However, contrary to those predictions, Bitcoin‚Äôs price rebounded sharply. Although it is now undergoing a ~30% correction, mining difficulty continues to climb. Historically, a decline in mining difficulty has been associated with miners shutting down less efficient rigs, which often signals broader market distress. However, current data, according to Avocado suggests that miners have not yet begun offloading large amounts of Bitcoin, indicating that they are holding onto their reserves rather than selling at lower prices. Another key metric Avocado pointed out is the Miner Position Index (MPI). Previously, this metric showed signs of selling pressure in November 2024. However, this activity did not lead to a significant market downturn, according to the CryptoQuant analyst. Instead, miners appear to be maintaining a holding strategy, suggesting that the broader uptrend remains intact. If Bitcoin‚Äôs correction extends further, a decrease in mining difficulty could be a potential indicator of miner capitulation, but as of now, the network remains resilient. Stablecoin Transfers and Market Absorption In a separate analysis, CryptoQuant analyst Mignolet has observed a surge in the total amount of stablecoin transfers, a trend that typically does not occur while Bitcoin‚Äôs price is declining but rather after a drop, during a market consolidation phase. This suggests that large-scale investors could be absorbing market shocks through over-the-counter (OTC) transactions, reducing the impact of further price declines. Mignolet also noted that increased activity in stablecoin transfers, combined with a rise in active Bitcoin addresses, signals heightened network participation. This pattern has historically indicated spot accumulation, which can serve as a precursor to price recoveries.

The proposal seeks to reduce the asset inflation rate by 80% by moving from a fixed-rate token emission to a market-based model. Over the past week, mixed views circulated on digital asset spaces. At the time of writing, proponents have secured the necessary quorum (71.85%) in favor. Validators Lambast Possible Risks Crypto enthusiast Dave wrote on X that the move will favor larger validators over smaller players. He added that this will lead to high centralization and a scenario where the rich get richer. Solana validator SolBlaze.org noted that SIMD-0228 threatens Solana‚Äôs decentralization and the wider ecosystem. While it sounds good in theory, presently, the fixed 15% inflation decrease will be taken to extreme levels. According to the validator, rewards will plunge up to 80% with users looking for better yield. This reduced stake affects network security and disproportionately affects small validators. These network participants at 0% interest maintain servers and get block fees. Furthermore, Solana Foundation President Lily Liu described the proposal as half-baked, pointing to the benefits of a predictable capital market. She added that infrastructure remains the foundation of most networks and needs a certain level of stability. ‚Äú What‚Äôs the greater risk and cost to our ecosystem: overpaying for security, or underinvesting in growth? On security: we were dogged for years as the centralized VC chain. We finally overcame that. But now we have 228 which is a VC proposal that centralizes the network! On growth: we‚Äôve achieved impressive growth ‚Äì and we need to continue to invest. Other ecosystems have noticed our ascent and are gearing up to compete,‚Äù Lui wrote. Solana‚Äôs Co-founder Backs The Proposal Solana‚Äôs co-founder Anatoly Yakovenko backed the proposal, allaying the decentralization concerns. In an X post, he explained that the cost of inflation hitting $1-$2 billion annually will spark losses for small validators and wealth managers. Another argument for the proposal is the incentive for participation to secure the network while inflation drops. Per the release , higher inflation drives centralization. On the other hand, low inflation fuels Solana‚Äôs decentralized finance ( DeFi ) presence. ‚Äú Additionally, a high staking rate can be viewed as unhealthy for new DeFi protocols, since it means the implied hurdle rate is the inflation cost. Lowering the ‚Äúrisk-free‚Äù inflation rate creates stimulative conditions and allows new protocols to grow.‚Äù",Cryptocurrency|News|SOL|Solana,EN,0,0,SOL|MARKET|REGULATION,"{'name': 'ZyCrypto', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/zycrypto.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",zycrypto,2025-03-13 08:01:50

The large-cap altcoin, with a fully diluted valuation of about $18.8 billion and a 24-hour average trading volume of around $935 million, pumped over 11 percent in the past 24 hours to retest a crucial resistance level of around $1.72. Although the Open Mainnet is still in its infancy stage of mainstream adoption, the Pi network has remained relevant against all odds. Moreover, Pi coin has been the top trending digital asset on Coingecko in the past few consecutive days. Pi Coin Price Prediction As Coinpedia previously stated, Pi Price has been battling with bearish sentiment in the past two weeks as early adopters accelerate profit-taking. Moreover, early adopters of the Pi network, currently amounting to over 60 million, have been waiting for the token listing for the past six years. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Pi Network‚Äôs 82.8 Billion Token Control Raises Decentralization Concerns , However, Pi price flashed a bullish signal after rebounding over 11 percent in the past 24 hours to retest the neckline of a prior head and shoulders (H&S) pattern . From a technical analysis standpoint, Pi price must consistently close above the resistance level around $1.8 to invalidate further market correction. Furthermore, the four-hour Relative Strength Index (RSI) rebounded from the 70 percent level earlier today and dropped to 58 percent at the time of this writing. However, if Pi coin consistently closes below the resistance level around $1.8, a macro reversal pattern will be confirmed with a midterm target of around $1.2 in the coming weeks. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

This plan aims to guard traders from extreme market swings giving them a more steady and safe trading experience. But how does this fund help the typical crypto trader at a time when Bitcoin has dropped under $83k? Understanding LBank‚Äôs Futures Risk Protection Fund Price swings are a normal part of crypto trading, and quick price jumps can lead to forced sell-offs that put traders at a loss. LBank‚Äôs new fund tries to fight these sudden market shifts, giving users money protection when they face losses due to big price changes. The fund kicks in during what LBank calls ‚Äúwick events‚Äù ‚Äì times when the K-line price moves more than 2% away from the fair market price in just one minute before bouncing back. The protection covers the top 100 futures trading pairs, including Bitcoin (BTC) , Ethereum (ETH) , and Solana (SOL) making sure it includes a wide range of high-liquidity assets. How Traders Benefit Compensation for Losses ‚Äì Traders affected by forced liquidation or stop-loss triggers due to price spikes will receive 120% of their losses. This compensation is credited in USDT to their spot accounts within 48 hours, reducing the financial strain caused by sudden market movements. Additional Airdrop Rewards ‚Äì In addition to individual compensation, LBank will allocate an extra 10,000 USDT whenever a price spike occurs. This amount is proportionally distributed to all position holders of the affected trading pair, further rewarding active traders. Market Stability and Trust ‚Äì LBank‚Äôs creation of this fund shows its dedication to fair trading and market integrity. This move helps lower the risks linked to rapid trading and sudden market changes What Sets This Fund Apart? Unlike traditional insurance mechanisms, LBank‚Äôs approach ensures rapid and transparent settlements using USDT, simplifying the process for traders. With over 15 million users worldwide, the platform is leveraging its strong market presence to introduce a safety net that enhances user confidence and trading continuity. Moreover, by integrating data from the top five derivatives platforms listed on CoinMarketCap, LBank ensures that compensation decisions are based on market-wide consensus rather than internal pricing models. This level of transparency sets a new standard in risk protection for futures traders. The Bigger Picture: A Safer Futures Market While there are several hacks happening across the globe as the hype around top cryptos like Bitcoin and the rest intensifies, crypto futures trading also has major risks. Nonetheless, steps like LBank‚Äôs $100 million safety fund help lessen the effects of sudden market shifts. As more exchanges look into ways to handle risk, traders can expect a safer and more stable trading scene. For those actively engaged in futures trading, LBank‚Äôs latest move is a game-changer-offering not just protection, but also incentives that turn market volatility into an opportunity rather than a setback. As crypto markets continue to evolve, trader-first innovations like this could define the next phase of responsible trading.

However, with the rise of DuragDoge also known as the DOGE killer, it seems investors have already made their choice regarding the crypto coin to invest in. This top NFT coin has attracted a large number of savvy investors with its unique tale that every trader can relate to. There are a lot of meme coin projects that come with so many promises but don‚Äôt deliver much at the end of the day. $DURAG has come to change the narrative by combining the fun of memes with the usefulness of a crypto coin. Read on to find out why XRP and DOGE seem to be losing investors to the $DURAG crypto trading project. The Ripple (XRP) Ecosystem Faces More Bearish Tendencies In a recent tweet, a popular crypto analyst pointed out that XRP‚Äôs daily chart was making a head-and-shoulders shape. This is a scientific sign that prices are going down, and it usually comes before big drops. Notably, this negative outlook comes at a time when XRP and the crypto market as a whole are going through new chaos, just one day after a huge price increase. After selling at $1.96 two days before, XRP got close to $3 on Sunday. But XRP has dropped more than 18% and is now worth only $2.23. Taking this into account, the crypto expert said that if XRP falls below $2 again, bigger drops might be on the way. Dogecoin (DOGE) On The Path For a Rebound A classic cup-and-handle design has formed, which could mean that Dogecoin is going to go up in price. This type of basic analysis usually shows a period of building up before a breakout. The crypto trading market has been in a bear market since May 2021, when it hit its all-time high. The chart pattern shows a rounded bottom that lasts until late 2023. Recently, the price responded positively by breaking above a trendline that had been going down since early 2024. It reached a high of $0.2408 before corrective action pushed it back down to $0.1934, a 19.28% drop in one session. This pullback could be seen as a good test of the breakout zone, which could lead to a future rally-up. If Dogecoin stays above the support levels of $0.18 and $0.19, it could build steam toward higher resistance levels, which could mean big gains for traders. But whatever gains DOGE has in store for its investors can not be compared to the massive gains $DURAG offers as a top NFT coin. DuragDoge ($DURAG): The New Crypto Project Known As The DOGE Killer When traders talk about the best crypto to invest in 2025, they refer to no other crypto project than the DuragDoge project. The rich hustle culture at DuragDoge has emerged to shake up the market because it combines community culture with new ideas all tailored to making traders win. For meme coin fans who are always looking for new opportunities to explore in crypto trading, having $DURAG on your side would be the best way to make huge gains this year. In addition to a relatable story, this top NFT coin has a lot of useful features that can put you on a new path of profiting in crypto trading. As of right now, the presale for $DURAG is live, and experts are already calling it the best crypto to invest in for huge returns this 2025. The price of one $DURAG token is $0.0009, currently at the lowest price it can ever be. This was put in place by the founders of DuragDoge so that every crypto trader, both billionaires and beginners alike, can have access to join this next crypto boom. Summary While XRP and DOGE fight to keep their portfolios in green, the $DURAG crypto project is stressless surging in its presale, constantly hitting new marks. Smart investors have gotten on board with this new project as they are convinced that $DURAG is the best crypto to invest in right now. Join the $DURAG presale and make 100x gains today!

On-chain data indicated that 356,665 coins were sold recently, a converse action to the current market cool-down. In response, traders and investors speculate whether it is possible for LINK price to hit $45 ahead, as the coin is already up 2% in the past 24 hours despite the selloff. Chainlink Whale Selloff: 356K Token Dump Ignites Caution According to an X post by Onchain Lens on March 13, a Chainlink whale sold 356,665 coins for $4.59 million USDC at an average price of $12.88. Per the data, the whale address ‚Äò0xc6f7f‚Äô was recorded as making the selloff transaction. For context, colossal selloffs by whales signal a loss of confidence in an asset‚Äôs potential for gains. In turn, traders and investors reckon a poor market performance ahead. Besides, it‚Äôs also noteworthy that the sell order may be due to a panic-selling sentiment prevailing across the market at present. Traders and investors reflect a cautious approach to risk assets amid severe macro heat. Nevertheless, the Chainlink whale still holds 7,693 LINK tokens, worth $101,533. The undermined existing holding indicates that the trader may not be confident about gains ahead but still hopes for a best-case scenario wherein the price recovers from the broader volatility. Crypto Market Today However, the crypto market appears to be easing pressure as the latest U.S. CPI data revealed cooling inflation. In turn, BTC and major-league altcoins prevented further downside price risk today. Simultaneously, LINK price also eased up, witnessing slight intraday gains and reflecting resilience. Yet, market participants remain uncertain over future movements as the selloff indicates a dip while broader developments could conversely uplift the market sentiment. LINK Price Soars Despite Whale Selloff As of press time, LINK price witnessed gains worth 2% intraday and closed at $13.15. It bottomed and peaked at $12.82 and $13.77 over the past day. The coin is currently rising in sync with today‚Äôs broader crypto market trend. Top Analyst Weighs Bullish Remarks On Chainlink Simultaneously, renowned market analyst ‚ÄòBitcoin Buddha‚Äô took to X, projecting bullishness over future movements despite the massive selloff. As per the analyst‚Äôs post and price chart, Chainlink ‚Äúseems to be recovering after testing support near $12.‚Äù This paves the way for further gains and thus, a new ATH if recovery sustains, per the analyst. Source: Bitcoin Buddha, X On the other hand, a LINK price prediction by CoinGape revealed that the technical chart on the token‚Äôs weekly time frame shows a bullish engulfing pattern. This formation suggests a strong momentum that favors buyers. Overall, the abovementioned dynamics indicated that the coin could pump ahead despite the massive selloff. On the other hand, another report revealed that a $45 price target remains possible as long as Chainlink holds a key support zone between $6 and $9. Crypto market traders and investors continue to thoroughly monitor the token amid broader trends impacting the market.

Analysts predict further upside potential. Speculation is mounting about a potential Binance listing on March 14, while Gemini has hinted at a major announcement on March 13, fueling anticipation within the PI community. PI Outperforms the Leaders Pi Network‚Äôs native token saw the light of day on February 20, and since then, it has experienced significant volatility. The price surpassed $1.80 on launch day, but it tanked below $0.65 mere days later. The bulls retook control towards the end of February, and the valuation hit an all-time high of almost $3. The ongoing month has offered more turbulence, with PI dipping below $1.30 on March 9. However, that marked a local bottom, and currently, the price is worth approximately $1.70 (per CoinGecko‚Äôs data), representing a 15% increase on a daily scale. PI Price, Source: CoinGecko The coin‚Äôs resurgence coincides with a slight rebound of the entire cryptocurrency market. However, PI has outperformed most of the top 100 digital assets in terms of daily gains. Bitcoin (BTC), for instance, is up 2% for the day, whereas Ripple (XPR) has climbed by 3% for that timeframe. According to some industry participants, PI has much more room for growth. The X user JAVON MARKS recently claimed that the price chart seems to have formed ‚Äúa bullish Falling Wedge pattern breakout‚Äù that might be followed by a bull run to fresh peaks. ‚ÄúPrices could be set for an over 72% increase back close to the $3 mark,‚Äù the analyst predicted. The Approaching Pi Day Pi Network will celebrate its sixth birthday on March 14 . The date also symbolizes the mathematical constant œÄ (pi), which is approximately 3.14. Recently, there have been increased rumors that Binance might list PI that day. In February, the world‚Äôs largest crypto exchange held a community vote to determine whether its users would want to see PI available for trading. Over 86% of the voters clicked the ‚Äúyes‚Äù option, but PI remains unavailable on the platform. A potential listing will increase the coin‚Äôs liquidity and accessibility and could trigger upward pressure on the price. Historically, support from Binance has resulted in substantial rallies for the involved cryptocurrencies. Meanwhile, the US-based crypto exchange Gemini might also hop on the bandwagon. Earlier this week, the company prepared the community for big news that is about to be announced on March 13 . Some users commenting on the post suggested that the listing of PI could be the upcoming development. The well-known exchanges that have already embraced Pi Network‚Äôs native token include Bitget, Gate.io, MEXC, OKX, and more.

Although the BTC price managed to reclaim levels above $83,000, the real excitement lies around the XRP price. The token has demonstrated a strong comeback after visiting lows below $2, which manifests growing bullish momentum around the token. One of the major reasons for the downfall of the XRP price , which also restricted the rally from marking a new ATH during the 2021 bull run, was the ongoing lawsuit against Ripple. The delisting from the US-based exchanges has made some of the market participants uncertain over the next price action. Meanwhile, the price could trigger a strong bullish action soon as some reports suggest these uncertain clouds over Ripple are expected to fade away. As per some insider reports, the case is in the process of wrapping up. We have seen the SEC closing the investigation and lawsuits over various crypto platforms in the past couple of weeks. And the delay with Ripple is speculated to be over the fine of $125 million imposed by the SEC and the permanent injunction preventing the company from selling XRP to institutional investors. Despite the bullish sentiments surrounding it, the XRP price is facing some bearish pressure as it fails to surpass pivotal resistance after a rebound. The latest rebound, however, invalidated the H&S pattern, but the price failed to rise above $2.28, which raises some concerns. Meanwhile, the RSI is incremental regardless of a minor divergence. On the other hand, the Ichimoku cloud is preparing for a bullish crossover and as a result, the price is expected to maintain a range-bound consolidation between $2.03 and $2.27. Once the price rises above the range, it may continue to test the higher targets. With the speculation of the closure of the Ripple vs. SEC lawsuit, the traders are expected to become optimistic over the next price action. Besides, the platform is creating a DFSA license to enable blockchain-powered crypto payments while Franklin Templeton joins the race for XRP ETF along with Grayscale, Wisdomtree, etc. and others. Therefore, these external factors are expected to impact the XRP price, which may soar high and reach a 2-digit figure soon.",Price Analysis|Ripple (XRP),EN,0,0,TRADING|XRP|REGULATION|BTC|MARKET,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-03-13 08:16:51
