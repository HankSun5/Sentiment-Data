After reaching an all-time high (ATH) on November 22, Solana has experienced a 23% retracement, testing investor confidence. However, analysts remain optimistic, with many expecting a significant upward move in the coming weeks. Related Reading: Ethereum Forming A Symmetrical Pattern – Key Resistance At $4,100 Renowned analyst Jelle recently shared a technical analysis highlighting Solana’s strong potential. According to Jelle, the monthly chart for SOL is primed for an “absolute monster run,” indicating that the current consolidation phase may be laying the groundwork for a powerful breakout. This view aligns with the broader sentiment that Solana’s resilience above $210 could act as a springboard for the next phase of its rally. As one of the leading altcoins in the crypto market, Solana has attracted attention for its robust performance and potential to lead the next leg of the bull market. With the price now consolidating after a sharp pullback, all eyes are on SOL’s ability to maintain its critical support and reclaim momentum. Whether Solana can deliver on its bullish promise will be a key focus for traders and investors alike in the coming weeks. Solana Holds Key Demand Solana is currently trading above a critical level for this cycle—the $210 mark. This price point, which previously acted as a significant resistance, has now flipped into a vital support level, setting the stage for Solana’s next potential rally. The importance of this level cannot be overstated, as it represents a key area where buyers are stepping in to defend SOL’s bullish momentum. Renowned analyst Jelle recently shared a compelling technical analysis on X, emphasizing Solana’s strong outlook. According to Jelle, Solana’s monthly chart is primed for what he described as an “absolute monster run.” His analysis highlights how SOL’s price is now testing its 2021 all-time high (ATH) as support, a critical juncture that could determine its trajectory in the weeks to come. Jelle’s simple yet powerful chart indicates that if Solana manages to push decisively above the $210 level, it will confirm the strength of this support and potentially trigger a massive bull run. This rally could result in impressive gains for SOL, positioning it as a standout performer in the crypto market. Related Reading: Bitcoin Breaks ATH Pushing Back Into Price Discovery – BTC To $130K? For now, all eyes are on Solana’s ability to sustain its momentum and break higher. As it consolidates above this essential level, traders and investors are closely monitoring its next moves, anticipating the possibility of a historic price surge. Price Action Suggests A Big Move Soon Solana is trading at $221, maintaining its strength above the critical $210 support level. This resilience has bolstered confidence among investors, as SOL’s price action aligns bullishly across all time frames. Solana is gearing up for a major rally, but it must first overcome the $245 resistance level to confirm the uptrend. Market dynamics indicate that SOL is in a prime position for upward momentum. Unlike other assets that may show signs of hesitation or potential consolidation, Solana exhibits a well-defined price structure that strongly favors a breakout. The lack of bearish signals further solidifies this outlook, as there is little indication of an imminent correction or prolonged sideways trading.

If SOL successfully breaches the $245 resistance with strength, it could trigger a wave of buying pressure, propelling the price to new heights.

The stock’s been on a tear, climbing 40% since the U.S. presidential election. At $476.73, Tesla’s market cap now sits at a jaw-dropping $1.53 trillion. Compare that to Nvidia—last year’s golden child of growth stocks—sitting at $129.92 with a market cap of $318 billion. Analysts aren’t missing a beat. Tesla and Nvidia are two sides of the same coin: both are fueled by a tech future that seems unstoppable. Tesla has cars and autonomous tech; Nvidia has chips and AI infrastructure. One builds the machine, the other runs the software. Yet while Nvidia’s growth is starting to cool, Tesla’s numbers keep pulling investors in. Tesla’s 52-week range speaks volumes: it’s climbed from $138.80 all the way to $483.99 this year. Nvidia has moved between $47.32 and $152.89, a solid performance but far from Tesla’s high-octane climb. Why Wall Street’s watching Tesla like it watched Nvidia Cathie Wood, CEO of Ark Invest, says she sees Tesla hitting $2,600 by 2029, driven by what she calls “unmatched growth” in profits and revenues. If Wood’s predictions play out, Tesla could hit an enterprise value of $8.2 trillion in just five years. That makes Nvidia’s peak look tame by comparison. Investors are biting. The excitement is Tesla’s move toward AI-powered autonomous driving. It’s no secret Tesla isn’t just an electric car company anymore. Self-driving software and its robotaxi ambitions have Wall Street betting on a future Tesla that doesn’t just sell cars—it sells rides, powered by AI. Tesla’s strategy echoes Nvidia’s dominance during the AI boom. Nvidia’s chips became essential to generative AI development, fueling companies like OpenAI and driving profits to record highs. Tesla’s AI, on the other hand, lives on the roads. If it perfects autonomous driving, its software will become as essential as Nvidia’s chips. But there’s a catch. Tesla trades at a staggering price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 162. Nvidia’s ratio? A much more palatable 51.14. That makes Tesla a high-risk, high-reward bet. Goldman Sachs recently pointed this out, cautioning that Tesla’s valuation may be running ahead of its earnings. Nvidia’s growth is slowing, Tesla’s just getting started Nvidia is still the face of AI infrastructure, but the cracks are showing. After growing revenue by over 200% in recent quarters, analysts now expect Nvidia’s growth to slow to around 70%. Still impressive, but a clear sign that the AI boom is leveling out. Nvidia’s reliance on a handful of mega clients—like cloud giants and AI startups—has some investors worried. Tesla, meanwhile, is all momentum. The market sees a company that’s just scratching the surface of its AI potential. Self-driving cars are Tesla’s big bet. The trading data backs this up. Tesla has been gaining traction as one of Wall Street’s most traded stocks. Nvidia still holds the crown, with 197 million shares traded on December 17 compared to Tesla’s 108 million. Investors go all in on US stocks The bullish sentiment on Tesla is part of a broader trend. Bank of America’s Global Fund Manager Survey shows investors are dumping cash and going all in on equities. Cash allocations hit their lowest point since 2001, falling from 4.3% to 3.9%. That’s a sign investors are chasing gains and aren’t interested in sitting on the sidelines. Michael Hartnett, a strategist at Bank of America, called the mood “super-bullish.” Tesla’s surge, fueled by its AI story, is a perfect fit for this environment. Wall Street sees a growth machine, and it’s hungry for more. Interest rate cuts are adding fuel to the fire. Traders expect the Federal Reserve to start cutting rates, making stocks even more attractive. The S&P 500 is on track to close 2024 up more than 26%, far beyond anyone’s expectations. Analysts now predict another 10% climb next year, with growth stocks like Tesla leading the way. Nvidia played that role in 2023. Now Tesla’s taking the baton.

Her push for a national Bitcoin reserve comes amid a historic market upsurge that has propelled the world’s largest crypto by market capitalization to new heights in recent weeks, with BTC today marking a new record high above $108,000. No To Digital Euro, Yes To Strategic BTC Reserve In a speech before the European parliament, Sarah Knafo urged European lawmakers to establish a strategic BTC reserve. Knafo declared, “It is time to protect our people from inflation and the poor economic choices of our states.” She then reiterated her statements in a post on X (aka Twitter). She also cautioned that the European Central Bank’s plans of launching a central bank digital currency could result in a “dystopian world” where transactions are monitored, and citizens are debunked for simple remarks on social media platforms. The lawmaker stated, “it is time to bet on freedom,” adding: “No to the digital euro, yes to a strategic Bitcoin reserve.” Knafo further indicated that it’s time for the ECB to stop “totalitarian temptations” by urging a shift from regulatory overreach in crypto to adopting the decentralized nature of Bitcoin. She pointed out that Europe has adopted a different approach to crypto. While the U.S. mulls a strategic, national stockpile of the top cryptocurrency, local regulators in Europe have been mostly focused on regulation, taxation, and suppressing innovation. Knafo highlighted the outstanding success of El Salvador, where President Nayib Bukele made the unpopular decision to make Bitcoin legal tender in late 2021. Bukele was harshly criticized by U.S. politicians, the World Bank, and the IMF for the move. Nonetheless, the Latin American nation’s Bitcoin experiment has paid off handsomely , garnering over $300 million in unrealized profits so far. Calls To Stockpile Bitcoin Gain Traction Around The World Knafo’s speech comes as the U.S. stance toward Bitcoin undergoes massive changes following Donald Trump’s win against Kamala Harris last month. Trump and his allies have frequently voiced their support behind legislation to create a Bitcoin strategic reserve and will soon be well-positioned to make that a reality. Several U.S. lawmakers have made pushes to establish a strategic Bitcoin reserve. Binance ex-CEO Changpeng “CZ” Zhao recently forecasted the BTC reserve policy would be imitated globally. “This also has a knock-on effect on other countries in the world. If the U.S. is doing this, then every other country will have to do this,” he posited at the Bitcoin MENA conference last week. Notably, government officials in Brazil have already submitted legislation to realize that possibility, while a Japanese lawmaker named Satoshi put forth a formal request to his nation’s legislature last week to start a discussion about developing a national Bitcoin reserve for Japan.",Bitcoin|News|Bitcoin News|El Salvador,EN,0,0,ASIA|BTC|FIAT|MARKET|REGULATION,"{'name': 'ZyCrypto', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/zycrypto.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",zycrypto,2024-12-17 22:43:57

Cynthia Lummis",https://www.cryptopolitan.com/pro-digital-asset/,"Senator Cynthia Lummis believes 2025 will be a key year for Bitcoin, with the U.S. leading in digital assets under David Sacks. She proposes a Bitcoin reserve to protect against inflation and increase the dollar value. And believes the most pro digital asset administration ever. The year 2025 is looking like a big moment for Bitcoin and digital assets, with strong administration supporting their future. Senator Cynthia Lummis from Wyoming said that 2025 will be the year Bitcoin takes off. She believes the U.S. will become the world leader in digital assets and financial innovation. The Appointment of David Sacks as “Crypto Czar” Announcements comes with the appointment of David Sacks as the “Crypto Czar. ” David Sacks is a prominent venture capitalist and one of the early PayPal executives with deep knowledge and understanding of the tech world. Sacks has advocated for Bitcoin and other digital currencies, and many in the crypto community see him as a strong figure who can help shape policies that the growth of digital assets. Senator Lummis strongly supports Sacks’ leadership and believes that the U.S. will take a leading role in digital assets under his guidance. “ Under David Sacks’ leadership, the U.S. is primed to lead the world in digital assets and financial innovation,” said Lummis. Michael Saylor also supports this vision. He shares Lummis’ excitement, saying, “Under David Sacks’ leadership, the U.S. will not only lead the world in digital assets but also set the stage for financial innovation like we’ve never seen before.” Saylor’s endorsement of Sacks shows that many influential figures in the crypto community believe that this leadership is the key to true potential of digital assets in the U.S. Lummis’ Vision on Strategic Bitcoin Reserve One of Lummis’ bold proposals is the idea of a “strategic Bitcoin reserve” and mentions ” My Strategic Reserve.” This would involve the U.S. government acquiring and holding Bitcoin as part of its financial reserves, similar to how the country holds gold today. Lummis believes that Bitcoin can serve as a store of value that will protect the U.S. from inflation, strengthen the U.S. dollar, and improve the country’s financial health. She said, “I look forward to working closely with David Sacks to pass comprehensive digital asset legislation and my strategic Bitcoin reserve.” If adopted, this idea could change how the U.S. approaches its financial reserves and set an example for other countries to follow. The strategic Bitcoin reserve is not just a theoretical idea Lummis has suggested that the U.S. could use existing gold certificates to purchase Bitcoin without affecting the balance sheet. This could save billions of dollars and make the country’s financial system more resilient. With the right leadership and support, such a proposal could be a game changer for the global economy. The idea of the U.S. government formally adopting Bitcoin into its financial strategy would greatly increase the cryptocurrency market. Some states in the U.S., like Wisconsin and Michigan, have already begun experimenting with crypto in their investment portfolios. However, if the federal government takes action and incorporates Bitcoin into its reserves, it could open the doors for even more institutional investors and major players in the global financial markets. 2025 holds much promise for Bitcoin and digital assets. With leaders like Senator Cynthia Lummis, David Sacks, and Michael Saylor working together, the U.S. is on track to become the global leader in digital assets and financial innovation.

Trump Patriot (TRUMPPAT), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 19,000% in price in the coming days. This is because TRUMPPAT is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Trump Patriot can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Trump Patriot could become the next viral memecoin. Trump Patriot launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Trump Patriot on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Trump Patriot by entering its contract address – 9hmvtogFEjzZQMFfJ5Hiq7fQSq7E38mG3Qjb7X42qM6P – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like TRUMPPAT.

Sim, previously sanctioned by OFAC, oversaw the schemes, leveraging a complex web of crypto exchanges, money mules, and shell companies. Crypto cash-outs and the UAE connection The network’s key players operated primarily out of the United Arab Emirates. Lu Huaying, a Chinese national, allegedly began converting North Korean-obscured cryptocurrency into cash in early 2022. Between then and September 2023, Lu successfully laundered millions of dollars on behalf of Sim Hyon Sop. The scheme used money mules and crypto-to-fiat conversions to disguise the funds’ origins, allowing the DPRK to purchase goods and services essential for its missile development. Zhang Jian, another Chinese national based in the UAE, stepped in later. Between late 2022 and early 2023, Zhang facilitated fiat currency exchanges for Sim and allegedly acted as a cash courier. The funds, moved through layers of intermediaries, ultimately financed North Korea’s weapons programs. Green Alpine Trading, LLC, served as the core of the operation. Registered in the UAE, the front company was integral to the laundering process, providing Sim’s network with the infrastructure to move money seamlessly across borders. OFAC said Green Alpine attempted to provide “financial, material, and technological support” for North Korea’s illicit operations. The sanctions now freeze all U.S.-linked property and financial assets tied to Lu, Zhang, and Green Alpine Trading. Any entity controlled 50% or more by the sanctioned individuals or company is also blocked. U.S. citizens and institutions are barred from engaging with the network. North Korea’s crypto laundering tactics revealed North Korea’s strategy is simple but effective: steal crypto, launder it, and cash it out through proxies . Digital assets, with their anonymity and decentralized nature, have become critical to the DPRK’s revenue generation. The regime exploits cybercrime, fraudulent IT work, and stolen funds to bypass international sanctions. Sim Hyon Sop, the architect of the UAE-based operation, represents North Korea’s Korea Kwangson Banking Corp (KKBC). KKBC is a state-run entity already blacklisted under U.S. and United Nations sanctions for its role in funding the DPRK’s WMD programs. From China, Sim directs these schemes, setting up shell companies and managing bank accounts to obscure the origin of the funds. The Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) has long pointed to individuals like Sim as key players. They work as agents for state-backed institutions, pulling strings behind the scenes while using intermediaries like Lu and Zhang to handle the dirty work. By relying on trusted proxies, Sim’s network operates across multiple jurisdictions with minimal direct involvement from Pyongyang. The scale of North Korea’s crypto operations is staggering. Since 2017, estimates show that Pyongyang has stolen over $3 billion in cryptocurrency. These funds directly finance its ballistic missile and nuclear weapons programs, fueling the regime’s military ambitions while evading traditional banking systems.

The draft was reportedly presented by @btcpolicyorg as an executive order focusing on making Bitcoin a strategic reserve asset within the Exchange Stabilization Fund (ESF). The two-page document addressed certain key points the institute recognized as important to cover in what many consider a preliminary draft. Recommendations to gain a competitive advantage with Bitcoin The executive order describes Bitcoin as a strategic reserve asset that can bolster the US dollar’s resilience. It also demands the establishment of a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve (SBR) to serve as a permanent national asset for economic security. According to the draft, the US policy should include: Creating the Bitcoin reserve to grow the economy and maintain the US’s financial dominance in world markets. Making Bitcoin a strategic asset stored by the government to diversify national reserves and boost economic security. Striving to make the US the number one country for digital assets in terms of attracting investment, talent, and innovation. The draft highlights the need for the United States to adapt to global trends in digital finance as this is the only way to maintain economic stability and leadership. It also tags Bitcoin as a decentralized and finite store-of-value asset, with comparisons to digital gold — a sentiment many crypto stakeholders seem to agree with. MicroStrategy ’s Michael Saylor has even gone as far as suggesting the US sell all its gold to buy BTC. It may sound over the top, but Micahel Saylor has overtly supported Bitcoin, and his BTC gamble has paid off exponentially. Establishment of the SBR and Bitcoin designation According to the draft, the SBR will be handled by the Treasury Department, which will have strict oversight, including audits and security measures. The draft also recommended that any Bitcoins held by federal agencies should be transferred to the SBR within 7 days of the order’s issuance. It also declared Bitcoin as a reserve asset suitable for holding within the ESF, with acquisition programs to begin within two months. According to the acquisition program, about $21 billion in Bitcoin will be bought within a year using funds from the ESF. The purchases will happen under the watchful eyes of protocols to reduce mismanagement risks. Within a month, secure custody frameworks are expected to be implemented and this could include partnerships with secure service providers. Meanwhile, it will be up to the Treasury to create stringent standards to promote long-term security, including cryptographic verifications and less reliance on third parties. On sales from the SBR and transparency According to the draft, long-term preservation will be a priority, which means that any BTC the SBR buys will be locked down for at least two decades to protect the country’s financial strength. The documents say that Bitcoin sales can only happen under exceptional circumstances (e.g., economic or security crises). Asset liquidation will also require detailed justification and presidential approval. The draft also proposed that when the sales happen, they will be done with transparency and minimal disruption. There will be a public proof of reserve and cryptographic receipt of Bitcoin holdings will be published quarterly to promote transparency. The Treasury will be expected to provide reports on performance, security, and strategic benefits of Bitcoin within the ESF. Coordination between the various government agencies, including the Treasury, Federal Reserve and Department of Defense, among others will be encouraged in alignment with national security and economic policies. This draft has not been approved or signed, but many who have seen it seem to believe it is good enough. David Bailey, the CEO of Bitcoin Magazine, shared screenshots of the draft. He also endorsed the document and mentioned that the president’s signature is the only step needed to fully implement the Bitcoin reserve. The general sentiment among crypto stakeholders is that the draft is sufficient as a framework to integrate Bitcoin into America’s national reserves. If properly done, it could also boost the country’s security, long-term economic growth, and leadership in the crypto world.

The token was given out through an airdrop to current NFT holders, attracting interest in the crypto market. In the first hour of trading, according to data from CoinMarketCap , PENGU reached a trading volume of $90 million. Pudgy Penguins PENGU Token Popularity Soaring The airdrop gave 23.5% of PENGU’s total supply to holders of Pudgy Penguins NFTs. It also set aside 22% of the token’s supply for the Solana and Ethereum communities, strengthening its presence on multiple blockchains. To support easy trading, 12.3% of the total supply is reserved for decentralized exchanges. Meanwhile, the PENGU token trades at $0.03875, a 675% increase within 24 hours. PENGU’s successful launch has made Pudgy Penguins very popular, making it the second most valuable NFT collection after CryptoPunks. This launch highlights the growing trend of adding native tokens to existing NFT projects to create larger ecosystems and improve community engagement. PENGU Tokens Soars Following CoinMarketCap Listing Penguiana, the penguin-themed meme coin on the Solana blockchain, witnessed a 70% market valuation surge after CoinMarketCap’s June listing . This significant achievement underscores growing investor confidence. It also marked a pivotal advancement in Penguiana’s journey within the cryptocurrency landscape. $PENGU has broadened its accessibility through listings on prominent decentralized exchanges such as Raydium and Birdeye. These exchanges have facilitated the token’s swift uptake and trading. As Penguiana continues to evolve, the team remains focused on enlarging its ecosystem and deepening community engagement. Safety in the NFT Industry The NFT industry has witnessed significant growth and adoption in recent years. Some digital firms have also leveraged the platform to expand their offerings. For instance, Sony, a maker of gaming consoles, has filed a patent application to move NFTs between different games and platforms. However, with NFTs’ popularity, safety worries have surfaced, especially the safety of the platform used to produce, store, and trade NFTs. Recall that one Ethereum wallet suffered massive losses after selling 500 Moonbirds NFTs . Therefore, prioritizing safety in the NFT industry is critical to protecting users’ investments, preventing hacking or theft of valuable assets, and preserving the industry’s reputation.

If adopted, this move aims to position the United States as a global leader in digital assets. It highlights Bitcoin’s role as “digital gold” and seeks to drive capital inflows, technological adoption, and financial resilience. U.S. Proposes Strategic Bitcoin Reserve Under Trump to Strengthen Economy and Safeguard Dollar The proposal stresses the need for the U.S. to adapt to the growing influence of digital assets in global finance. Bitcoin is a decentralized, finite asset that can strengthen the U.S. economy and safeguard the dollar. The order aims to diversify the ESF’s holdings and secure long-term economic stability by formally designating Bitcoin as a strategic reserve asset. JUST IN: Bitcoin Policy Institute drafts Executive Order for a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve for President Trump pic.twitter.com/bxJHZKa8Ue — Bitcoin Magazine (@BitcoinMagazine) December 17, 2024 The executive order establishes a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve (SBR) to manage Bitcoin as a permanent national asset. The Treasury Secretary would administer it, and strict measures would ensure transparency and accountability. Regular audits, advanced security protocols, and comprehensive reporting would be required to build public confidence. The order calls for consolidating all Bitcoin currently under federal control. Within seven days, agencies like the U.S. Marshal Service would be required to stop selling, auctioning, or transferring Bitcoin. Once legal ownership is confirmed, those holdings would move to the Strategic Bitcoin Reserve. Additionally, the Treasury Secretary would have 60 days to implement an acquisition program to purchase and manage Bitcoin under the ESF. Trump’s Bitcoin Reserve Plan: Will Seized BTC Kickstart a New Financial Era? Bitcoin surged to a record high above $107,000 on Monday after President-elect Donald Trump reaffirmed plans to establish a U.S. bitcoin strategic reserve, igniting enthusiasm among crypto supporters. A strategic reserve is a stockpile of critical resources to stabilize markets during crises. Examples include the U.S. Strategic Petroleum Reserve and China’s reserves of metals and grains. Analysts are divided on whether Trump could create the reserve through an executive order or if Congress must act. Trump hinted the reserve could start with 200,000 seized bitcoins, currently worth around $21 billion. Adding more would require government purchases, potentially funded through debt issuance or selling gold reserves. Senator Cynthia Lummis has proposed legislation for the Treasury to purchase 200,000 BTC annually for five years , funded by Federal Reserve profits and gold holdings. Supporters argue a Bitcoin reserve could help dominate the global market, reduce deficits, and strengthen the U.S. dollar.

Qubetics Is the Best Crypto to Invest in 2024!,https://thecoinrise.com/cardano-left-you-behind-qubetics-is-the-best-crypto-to-invest-in-2024/,"The cryptocurrency market is filled with opportunities, but it’s also easy to miss out. Cardano, one of the most recognised names in crypto, delivered impressive growth for early investors. But if you’re still waiting for the next big thing, it’s time to turn your attention to Qubetics ($TICS) . With an affordable presale price and outstanding real-world applications, Qubetics is quickly becoming the best crypto to invest in 2024. Let’s dive into how Qubetics and Cardano compare and why Qubetics might be the best opportunity to watch this year. Qubetics ($TICS): A Practical Solution with Impressive Returns Qubetics is not just another cryptocurrency looking to make a splash. As the world’s first Web3 aggregator , Qubetics connects real-world businesses and individuals to blockchain technology through efficient, user-friendly solutions. At its core lies an innovative approach to solve global challenges, particularly in secure digital communications and decentralised transactions. Currently, Qubetics is in its 13th presale stage, with tokens priced at just $0.0342. So far, over 350 million tokens have been sold to more than 10,300 holders, raising $6.9 million. These numbers alone make Qubetics one of the best cryptos to invest in 2024, offering massive upside potential for early investors. If you invest $8,500 in Qubetics at $0.0342 per token, analysts predict significant gains. By the end of the presale, when $TICS reaches $0.25, your investment could grow by 630.19% ROI. If the token hits $1 post-presale, that translates to a 2,820.78% ROI. Should Qubetics reach $15 after its mainnet launch, your initial investment could rise to a jaw-dropping $3.7 million. One of Qubetics’ standout features is its decentralised VPN (dVPN). The dVPN ensures privacy and security in an age where digital surveillance is rampant. For professionals like doctors, lawyers, and entrepreneurs, Qubetics’ dVPN offers a private way to manage confidential transactions and sensitive data securely. For individuals, it means safer browsing, enhanced online privacy, and greater control over personal information. With growing concerns about cybersecurity, Qubetics’ dVPN has become a game-changer for both individuals and businesses. This unique blend of practical use cases and investor potential is why Qubetics has earned its place as the best crypto to invest in 2024. By solving real-world problems and bridging the gap between Web3 and traditional industries, Qubetics offers far more than just speculation. It’s a utility-driven investment for the future. Cardano (ADA): A Steady Leader in Blockchain Cardano is one of the most respected projects in the cryptocurrency space. Known for its academic approach to blockchain development, Cardano prioritises security, scalability, and sustainability. It has created a robust ecosystem designed to handle decentralised finance (DeFi), smart contracts, and real-world enterprise solutions. In 2024, Cardano continues to expand its ecosystem. The recent updates to its smart contract platform have improved efficiency and lowered transaction fees. With increased adoption of decentralised applications (dApps), Cardano has attracted developers and businesses seeking secure blockchain solutions. Despite its steady growth, Cardano’s price has remained relatively stable, with analysts predicting modest gains for 2024. While its ecosystem remains robust, its growth rate no longer matches the potential seen in emerging projects like Qubetics. Investors looking for exponential returns may find Qubetics’ presale more appealing than Cardano’s current market position. Conclusion: Qubetics is the Best Crypto to Invest in 2024 If you missed Cardano’s early success, now is your chance to seize a new opportunity. Qubetics ($TICS) is rapidly emerging as the best crypto to invest in 2024, offering affordable entry points, real-world applications like dVPN, and extraordinary ROI potential. With its 13th presale stage still ongoing and tokens priced at $0.0342, Qubetics combines practical blockchain solutions with an investment opportunity that could deliver life-changing returns. For investors seeking the next big winner, Qubetics delivers unmatched potential to outperform established projects like Cardano.

Recent market demand showed renewed spot open interest, as BTC grew to over $108,300, a new price record. Bitcoin (BTC) rallied to its most recent price record as market sentiment shifted to increased spot demand. Analysts noted since October, market influences depended on spot trading, rather than being driven by the derivative market. During earlier bull market stages, open interest on derivative positions was higher, while spot trading and flows to exchanges were slow. In the last quarter of 2024, the BTC Fund Flow Ratio increased its baseline, suggesting a higher inflow of funds to and from exchanges. The BTC fund flow ratio suggest spot exchange activity increased in the last quarter of 2024. | Source: Cryptoquant The fund flow ratio is a metric of on-chain BTC transfers against transfers to exchanges. A more active exchange flow means the focus shifted to spot trading. In the past quarter of 2024, both derivatives and spot trading accelerated. However, as the year comes to a close, spot activity is growing more dominant. Derivative open interest for BTC on major centralized exchanges stalled at around $33B, sinking slightly from its peak. The BTC derivative market goes through cycles of accumulation and liquidation of leveraged positions. Those cycles often boost the price to a new range, causing the liquidation of short positions. With time, interest shifts to additional accumulation on the spot market. Leveraged position accumulation and liquidation cycles are happening at lower levels, without causing significant drawdown events. At the same time, BTC traders often use the spot market to realize short-term gains and reaccumulate. The behavior of short-term trader whales also goes against retail sentiment. As BTC trades above $106,000, retail is bullish, while smart money has turned bearish. Overall, trading behavior shifted the Bitcoin fear and greed index to the ‘extreme greed’ level at 87 points. Demand for actual BTC reserves is rising Demand is rising for owning and controlling BTC in the form of long-term reserves. Instead of leveraged positions, bets on the value of BTC are made by storing coins that are instantly accessible. Demand for physical coins and spot trading led to an increase in the Coinbase premium index . The index has been in the green for most of the past 30-day period. The Coinbase premium index is showing higher demand for spot BTC buying on the US dollar market. The index measures BTC prices on Coinbase against the Binance market, suggesting increased demand for direct buying. Spot trading for BTC also expanded the share of US dollar trading. More than 21% of all BTC volumes are against the US dollar, diminishing the role of stablecoins. Despite the expansion of stablecoins, the dollar-based spot market indicates a shift to direct BTC demand. BTC keeps moving into whale wallets The other major sources for BTC holding are miners, who still own 1.9M coins. ETF buying is also ongoing, retaining even more coins through Coinbase Custody. The third biggest source of demand for BTC comes from corporate buyers, who are buying BTC through new bond issues. This source is also the biggest shift from fiat to crypto ownership, betting on long-term BTC growth. Demand from Bitcoin ETF absorbs most of the physical selling pressure. As older cohorts of holders realize profits, Bitcoin ETF absorbs up to 90% of that selling pressure. Even large-scale whales have easily found liquidity on the market. Demand from MicroStrategy, MARA Holdings, and other corporate buyers is also a significant drain on available coins. Demand far outpaces daily BTC production of just 450 new coins. The current conditions with actual transfers of coins to even larger whale wallets are expected to create a supply crunch. Based on the Rainbow chart , BTC is still in the accumulation zone and possibly far from the cycle top. The next potential levels see BTC test $110,000 and a peak above $125,000.

Salesforce plans to hire 2,000 new salespeople to focus on selling artificial intelligence (AI) products as the company planning to expand its AI offerings. Salesforce to Hire 2,000 Salespeople for AI Expansion CEO Marc Benioff made this announcement during a company event in San Francisco on Tuesday, saying that the demand for AI tools is so high that the company is increasing its hiring plans. “We’re adding another couple of thousand salespeople to help sell these products,” Benioff said. “ We already had 9,000 referrals for the 2,000 positions we’ve opened. It’s amazing.” This announcement makes a big increase from the initial plan. A month ago, Benioff mentioned that Salesforce would hire 1,000 new salespeople for AI roles. The company is now doubling the count as it prepares to release its new AI agent software in February 2025. Salesforce aims to make AI a key part of its product lineup, with AI tools to help sales teams, marketers, and customer service agents do their jobs more efficiently. The new salespeople will help introduce and sell Salesforce’s latest AI technology, including the upcoming second version of its Agentforce platform. This software is designed to create AI-powered agents to handle complex tasks, like answering questions in Salesforce’s Slack app using all available data. The new AI agents will be able to respond to customer queries, making business operations smoother and faster. Benioff is very excited about Salesforce’s potential for AI. In a recent interview, he shared, “I’ve never been more excited about anything at Salesforce, maybe in my career.” He added that he expects the company to have over a billion AI agents within the next year. “This is the most exciting thing that’s happened to Salesforce,” he said. Salesforce’s AI Push Following 2022 Layoffs Salesforce’s move into AI comes after the company laid off over 7,000 employees in 2022. Cutting over 7,000 jobs to adjust to changing economic conditions. As of January 2024, Salesforce had 72,682 employees. Now, the company is focused on hiring more people to increase growth in the AI space. With its new AI agents and expanded sales team, Salesforce is aiming to become a major player in the AI industry.

Coinbase asked a U.S. court to deny BiT Global’s lawsuit in Northern California, which seeks $1 billion in relief and a temporary restraining order on wrapped Bitcoin’s ( wBTC )’s delisting. The Justin Sun-affiliated BiT Global sued Coinbase on Dec. 13 for planning to remove the wrapped Bitcoin ( BTC ) asset from its U.S.-based exchange. BiT Global claimed delisting wBTC was illegal, would cause irreparable harm to the token’s economics, and was unjustified as Coinbase listed unserious cryptocurrencies like meme coins. Also, launching cbBTC breached antitrust laws and threatened to create a Coinbase-controlled monopoly in the tokenized Bitcoin marketplace. The crypto exchange argued that California’s Unfair Competition Law was inapplicable. DefiLlama confirmed that cbBTC ranked outside the top 10 tokenized BTC assets by market capitalization. Coinbase has the right to choose whom to do business with, and no law requires it to allow bad actors or suspected bad actors onto its exchange… Coinbase does not have anything approaching monopoly power, and because its decision to delist wBTC was proper and justified based on the careful review it undertook and the unacceptable risk of doing business with an entity associated with Mr. Sun. Coinbase response to BiT Global lawsuit According to the December 17 court filing, material changes to wBTC’s stewardship, particularly Justin Sun’s majority control of the Bitcoin reserves, prompted Coinbase and other entities to reconsider their support for the asset. You might also like: Sky mulls cutting support for wBTC over Justin Sun affiliations The Securities and Exchange Commission charged Sun and three of his wholly owned companies with federal violations. Additionally, the FBI reportedly opened an inquiry regarding potential terror financing involving Sun. The U.S. Department of Justice has not indicted Sun by publishing time, neither have authorities issued any arrest warrants for the Tron ( TRX ) founder. Coinbase stated that its new wBTC risk assessments, in line with company listing standards, raised red flags, primarily due to Sun’s involvement. The exchange described its decision as “common sense” and necessary to protect its customers. The company also emphasized that delisting wBTC would not impact the token’s overall on-chain activity, which largely takes place on other platforms. Nor can BiT claim harm, let alone irreparable harm, from being delisted from an exchange where less than 1% of transactions involving wBTC are made. Perhaps that is why BiT sat on its claims for nearly a month before filing suit, belying any urgency for relief. The U.S. crypto titan asked the California Court to rule against BiT Global’s TRO request and $1 billion relief package, due to the firm’s ties to an allegedly indictable individual and fabricated emergency regarding wBTC. We've filed our response to BiT Global’s effort to stop our delisting of wBTC before any discovery or even formal response to their bogus claims. We lay out why this lawsuit lacks any semblance of merit and why their request for a TRO should be denied.

Japan is famous for its strict regulation of both the crypto and gaming sectors. Critics, however, say that a “lack of clarity regarding legal regulations, accounting, and taxation issues” have thus far held Japanese firms back from developing blockchain gaming titles. Powerful Partnership? The wider JCBA launched in 2016. Its membership has since grown to 155 firms.

That said, risks remain tilted towards a renewed meme coin pump at any point before the end of the year, or in early 2025. Sentiment remains bullish ahead of the arrival of the Trump administration in the White House in January. A Bitcoin strategic reserve , which seems more and more likely every day right now, could send BTC to the moon. And that could mean rotation into altcoins , including major meme coins.

How High Will Shiba Inu Go? Assuming the Shiba Inu price hits new highs for the year soon, it could soon challenge its record highs in the $0.000090 area soon. Beyond that, a parabolic rally could be in store. A rally towards the 3.618 or 4.236 Fibonacci extension from the 2023 lows back to the 2021 highs suggests gains of as much as 10x from current levels are very possible. That would see Shiba Inu attain a market cap of over $150 billion. That may seem ridiculous, but if Bitcoin hits $200,000, that would see its market cap exceed $4 trillion. In this scenario, SHIB’s market cap would only amount to about 4% of Bitcoin’s, which is to unbelievable when considering its position as a leading meme coin in the market. The near-term future looks very bright for the meme coin space and Shiba Inu, though, as ever, these are incredibly volatile markets. In order to reap big gains, investors also need to be able to HODL through rapid and aggressive downturns.

Metaplanet Inc., often referred to as the “Japanese MicroStrategy,” has announced the issuance of ¥4.5 billion (approximately $30 million) in zero-interest bonds to fund its Bitcoin acquisition strategy. The firm is positioning itself as Asia’s largest corporate Bitcoin holder. The announcement marks Metaplanet’s fourth series of bonds, with a maturity date set for June 16, 2025. The zero-interest bonds will be released in tranches which will allow the company to raise funds for Bitcoin purchases. Metaplanet plans to redeem these bonds through the previously issued warrants, according to reports. Metaplanet’s strategic Bitcoin acquisition plan Since April 2024, Metaplanet has made Bitcoin its treasury reserve asset and has already acquired over 1,150 BTC, worth about $122.67 million. This approach is similar to MicroStrategy’s Bitcoin reserve. Metaplanet’s new bond issuance is to speed up its Bitcoin buying strategy specifically to purchase more Bitcoin. By issuing zero-interest bonds, Metaplanet avoids short-term financial stress while using the funds to grow its assets. Investors benefit because these bonds are sold at a discount but pay the full value at maturity. The bond issuance news resulted in a 51% surge in Metaplanet’s stock price over the past five trading sessions. Shares reached an all-time high of 4,270 JPY, increasing the company’s market capitalization beyond the $1 billion mark. Over 27.8 billion yen (~$180 million) worth of Metaplanet shares was traded, showing the company’s ability to capitalize on its Bitcoin-centric approach. Even Simon Gerovich, CEO of Metaplanet, acknowledged the market’s overwhelming response. Metaplanet plans to issue additional private placement bonds worth up to ¥5 billion to expand its Bitcoin reserves. These bonds are to be issued in partnership with EVO FUND. The proceeds from the bond issuances will also be allocated exclusively for Bitcoin purchases, reinforcing Metaplanet’s long-term vision. Shareholder rewards program in Bitcoin In addition to its bold investment moves, the company also announced a Bitcoin rewards program. The company announced a 30-million-yen ($199,500) prize pool, which will reward shareholders who own at least 100 shares as of December 31, 2024. Through a lottery system, 2,350 selected shareholders will receive varying amounts of Bitcoin.

Santa Rides Shiba (SANTSHIB), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 19,000% in price in the coming days. This is because SANTSHIB is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Santa Rides Shiba can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Santa Rides Shiba could become the next viral memecoin. Santa Rides Shiba launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Santa Rides Shiba on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Santa Rides Shiba by entering its contract address – CxpeR8vdgeVWZFwBytS7PRrXHBwVgPJWZBJUcpK3k7vT – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like SANTSHIB.

Analysts speculate that this critical support level will be a bounce-off point for the Dogecoin price to reach $4 . However, in the shadow of the Dogecoin price’s hype, many top investors are putting their money into a new altcoin, WallitIQ (WLTQ) . Why? This AI altcoin, in the second presale stage, is priced at just $0.0243 and has the potential to outpace Dogecoin in reaching the $4 price milestone. WallitIQ (WLTQ) Will Beat The Dogecoin Price To The $4 Mark A technical analysis of the Dogecoin price reveals that Dogecoin (DOGE) has sustained a crucial uptrend line. This trend line has acted as support, with the Dogecoin price consistently bouncing off without going below. Market data highlights strong buyer interest at these levels, as each dip towards the trend line has been met with renewed confidence and buying activity. Yet, top investors consider WallitIQ (WLTQ) the most promising altcoin of 2025 and have been investing massively in this new AI altcoin. Despite its modest presale price, WallitIQ (WLTQ) has a compelling value proposition that could see it leapfrog over Dogecoin and win the race to $4. At $0.0243 , WallitIQ (WLTQ) provides an unbeatable entry point compared to the Dogecoin price at $0.4098 . For investors, this means the ability to accumulate significantly more tokens with less capital. WallitIQ (WLTQ) Offering Practical Solutions That Drive Adoption For just $0.0243 , WallitIQ (WLTQ) offers an affordable entry point for investors seeking massive returns. While the Dogecoin price movements heavily rely on market sentiment, WallitIQ’s (WLTQ) growth is driven by its utility and adoption in DeFi solutions. Its practical solutions to everyday crypto problems and innovative features drive rapid adoption. WallitIQ (WLTQ) has already shown signs of massive adoption. In just a few weeks, the project has raised over $2.7 million in presale revenue, attracting investors eager to purchase the AI altcoin at its discounted price. With predictions of a potential 55,000% increase in value, WallitIQ (WLTQ) has already secured a listing on CoinMarketCap and is preparing for exchange listings in 2025. While Dogecoin (DOGE) has Elon Musk’s tweets as its wild card, WallitIQ (WLTQ)’s growth is underpinned by strong fundamentals. The team behind the project has demonstrated a commitment to security and an unforgettable use experience. WallitIQ (WLTQ) prioritizes security with advanced AI-powered anomaly detection to monitor activity and quickly identify potential threats. Further enhancing its credibility, WallitIQ (WLTQ) subjected one of its smart contracts to a rigorous audit by SolidProof, ensuring a secure and reliable system. Holders of WallitIQ (WLTQ) altcoin can enjoy multiple benefits, including using the altcoin to pay transaction fees, earning staking rewards of up to 180% APY, accessing premium features, and taking advantage of unlimited referral bonuses and community rewards. At such a low price of $0.0243, even a modest increase in value can generate significant gains, making it an ideal investment for those looking to maximize returns. Why You Should Act Now While the Dogecoin price predictions of $4 are tempting, WallitIQ (WLTQ) offers a low-risk, high-reward proposition that investors cannot ignore.

37776413,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=663540,1734480059,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/newsbtc.png,Analyst Who Correctly Predicted The Fantom Breakout Above $1 Reveals What’s Next In The Parabolic Trend,https://www.newsbtc.com/news/fantom/fantom-breakout-above-1-trend/,"A crypto analyst on TradingView, known as ‘Tradecitypro,’ has published a detailed Fantom (FTM) report, breaking down the cryptocurrency’s price action across the daily and 4-hour timeframe. After accurately predicting Fantom‘s surge above $1, the analyst highlights key price levels, market trends, potential price movements, and bullish technical indicators for FTM’s next parabolic trend. Fantom Daily Timeframe: Signs Of Trend Weakness After correctly forecasting FTM’s price breakout at $0.84, the TradingView analyst has revealed that the cryptocurrency is now following a parabolic uptrend, supported by a curved ascending trendline. According to the analyst, Fantom’s price has reacted multiple times to this distinctive trendline, ending price corrections and resuming its upward momentum. During the last bullish surge during Fantom’s uptrend, the cryptocurrency broke past the 0.7707 resistance and rose to the weekly resistance zone at 1.1116, where it stabilized above that level. Moreover, several indicators suggest that FTM may be slowing down and losing momentum. Its candle sizes have been gradually shrinking, indicating reduced bullish activity. Additionally, price corrections have intensified, signaling increased selling pressures and potential profit-taking. Fantom’s trading volume has also declined, suggesting that traders’ interests might shift. Another technical indicator that is currently bearish is the Relative Strength Index (RSI), which is showing signs of divergence, signaling a potential reversal of the price of FTM drops below 55.74 on the RSI. Looking ahead, the TradingView analyst has revealed that a notable sign of sharp bullish trends and pre-pump movements is when a cryptocurrency exhibits weakness and a potential for a price reversal. If the current bearish trend for Fantom continues, the analyst has set the first minor resistance level at 1.6218. Additionally, if FTM can maintain a stable price above this zone, its next and strongest resistance could be at 3.2506. This resistance zone is near FTM’s all-time high of $3.46, representing a significant supply region. On the other hand, if FTM experiences a price correction, it would likely drop to the first support at the curved trendline. If the trendline is broken, the next price levels to watch are 1.1116 and 0.7707. A sustained price decline below 0.7707 would invalidate the previous bullish scenario for Fantom, potentially pushing the price further down to between 0.5349 and 0.2928. 4-Hour Timeframe: Ascending Channel And Potential Breakouts In the 4-hour timeframe, the TradingView analyst revealed that Fantom is currently moving within an Ascending Channel. The cryptocurrency’s price is interacting with the midline of the channel, providing temporary support. The analyst has revealed that no significant moves will be expected if Fantom remains within this Ascending channel. However, if the cryptocurrency can break out, it could lead to two potential scenarios: the start of a new parabolic trend or a trend exhaustion due to a loss in bullish momentum. The TradingView analyst has identified the price level at 1.636 as Fantom’s next static resistance. However, if FTM’s price has not yet reached this zone, the analyst suggests a safer strategy of taking long positions based on Dow Theory and channel breakouts.

Feels good, right? Well, the market’s buzzing with three coins that might just get you there. BTFD Coin (BTFD) is shaking up the scene with its massive presale momentum, Play-to-Earn (P2E) game, and unbeatable community vibe. At the same time, Brett (BRETT) and COQ Inu (COQ) are making waves in the meme coin world with explosive gains and strong blockchain integration. If you’re scouting the best meme coins to buy for 2025, you’ve landed at the right spot. Let’s break down what makes these three coins worth watching, with a laser focus on BTFD Coin, the presale powerhouse currently turning heads across the crypto space. BTFD Coin (BTFD): A Presale Powerhouse You Don’t Want to Miss BTFD Coin is not just a meme; it’s a movement. Launched with the ethos of “Buy The F**ing Dip,”* BTFD has turned the legendary investment mantra into a full-blown ecosystem that rewards early movers. Since the presale kicked off at just $0.000004 per coin, it’s been nothing but up. Now in Stage 12, the price has hit $0.00013, with the coin set to list at $0.0006 at the end of the presale. Here’s the jaw-dropper: BTFD has raised over $4.1 million, with more than 56 billion coins sold and 5,700+ holders already on board. That’s what you call momentum. If you’re wondering, “How much could I earn?”, let’s do the maths. Say you invest $1,000 right now in Stage 12. At $0.00013 per coin, you’ll bag a staggering 7.69 million BTFD coins. When the presale ends and the price hits $0.0006, your $1,000 investment could balloon to $4,615. And that’s just the start. But BTFD isn’t just about hype. The project has actual substance with its Beta P2E game now live. You can join the Bulls Squad, tackle levels, and get a taste of what’s to come. Rewards aren’t live in the Beta yet, but this sneak peek is proof that BTFD is building something solid. Add to that staking rewards with an average 90% APY and it’s clear why investors are loading up their bags. Oh, and did I mention the BTFD Coin Referral Program? Share your referral code and earn 10% of the raise amount in BTFD tokens if you make the top 20 leaderboard. Your friends get an extra 10% BTFD when they spend $50 or more. Everybody wins. With Ethereum as its backbone and liquidity locked for three years, BTFD isn’t messing around. This isn’t just a meme coin; it’s a full-on ecosystem, primed for 2025’s bull run. If you’ve been hunting for the best meme coins to buy for 2025, don’t miss this dip. BTFD is your golden ticket. Brett (BRETT): The Rising Star on Base Chain Let’s talk about Brett (BRETT), a meme coin that’s captured hearts and wallets alike. Inspired by its Base Chain integration, Brett has proven that it’s more than just a flash in the pan. Trading at $0.1749 with a market cap of $1.8 billion, Brett’s price has doubled since November 2024, showing strong momentum in the competitive meme coin space. What’s driving this growth? A combination of strategic exchange listings and solid community support. Major exchanges have opened their doors to Brett, bringing more liquidity and visibility to the project. There’s also mounting speculation that Brett might score listings on Binance and Coinbase, which would catapult its popularity even further. Despite the high volatility (par for the course with meme coins), Brett’s trajectory is hard to ignore. Its recent performance and integration with Base Chain make it a strong contender among the best meme coins to buy for 2025. Whether it’s the next Pepe or something even bigger remains to be seen, but Brett has certainly earned its spot on this list. COQ Inu (COQ): Avalanche’s Meme Coin King Over on the Avalanche blockchain, COQ Inu (COQ) is quietly stealing the show. Priced at $0.000002373 with a market cap of $162 million, COQ Inu has firmly established itself as Avalanche’s top meme coin. Boasting a 24-hour trading volume of $20.44 million, it’s clear that COQ Inu isn’t just a niche project—it’s a growing phenomenon. COQ Inu’s secret sauce lies in its transparency and tokenomics. The team has burned liquidity and renounced contracts, ensuring the community’s trust in the project. Combine that with Avalanche’s low fees and lightning-fast transactions, and COQ Inu offers a compelling alternative to Ethereum-based meme coins. Market sentiment has been a major driver here. COQ Inu’s recent recognition among high-ROI meme coins has attracted investors seeking the next big win. With its unique position in the Avalanche ecosystem and its commitment to decentralisation, COQ Inu is certainly one of the best meme coins to buy for 2025 if you’re looking to diversify beyond Ethereum. Final Thoughts: Don’t Miss Out on BTFD Coin’s Presale With 2025 just around the corner, the race to snag the best meme coins to buy for 2025 is heating up. BTFD Coin (BTFD) stands out as the clear front-runner, with its explosive presale success, P2E game, and community-driven vision. Raising over $4.1 million and counting, BTFD is shaping up to be the ultimate early-mover opportunity for investors ready to ride the bull run. At the same time, Brett (BRETT) is surging ahead on Base Chain, and COQ Inu (COQ) continues to dominate Avalanche with its transparent, low-fee model. Each of these projects offers something unique, but if you’re after a game-changing investment, BTFD Coin deserves your attention. Don’t let this opportunity pass you by. Join the BTFD presale now, stack your bags, and prepare to ride the bull into 2025. Timing is everything—and this is your moment to buy the f***ing dip.

Tether has invested strategically in StablR, a European startup focused on euro-denominated stablecoins. This partnership is to increase the use of stablecoins across Europe, especially with the European Union’s new regulations on digital assets set to take effect in 2024. Why Is This Investment Important? Stablecoins are digital currencies pegged to real-world assets like the US dollar or euro. They offer stability and making them less volatile than other cryptocurrencies. Tether’s investment in StablR is the sign of company’s commitment to promoting stablecoins in Europe, particularly as the region prepares for the upcoming Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA) regulation, which will regulate cryptocurrencies and stablecoins in the EU. StablR, which has already received a license in Malta to issue MiCA-compliant stablecoins and will use Tether’s tokenization platform, Hadron , to facilitate the conversion of traditional assets into digital tokens. By converting it will allow businesses to create digital versions of stocks, bonds, commodities, and more while complying with legal regulations on the whole. StablR’s Role and the Future of Stablecoins StablR offers two types of stablecoins: EURR , which is pegged to the euro, and USDR , which is pegged to the US dollar. Both stablecoins are available on popular blockchain networks like ERC-20 and Solana , and transactions on different platforms. With the help of Tether’s platform, StablR plans to expand its offerings and make stablecoins available on more blockchain networks, allowing even more people and businesses to use them. The stablecoin market is growing especially in countries with unstable economies, Europe is also showing increased interest, with many looking for alternatives to traditional banking systems. Tether’s investment in StablR comes as crypto exchanges adapt to new regulations in Europe (MiCA) that require stablecoin issuers to meet strict compliance and transparency standards. Tether’s investment in StablR helps bring stablecoins like EURR and USDR into Europe’s financial system. With Tether’s support, this partnership makes stablecoins easier to use and ensures they follow the rules in digital currencies.

Related Reading: The $589 XRP Dream: Believers Aren’t ‘Delusional’ Enough, Expert Says The study indicates that in the third quarter of 2024 Solana’s ecosystem funding reached $173 million, the highest level since mid-2022. This money flow shows a strong conviction in Solana’s ability to be the top blockchain platform. Solana: Key Drivers Of Growth One of the key reasons for this positive prognosis is the upcoming introduction of a spot SOL Exchange-Traded Fund (ETF). As regulatory conditions improve, experts predict that institutional investors will flock to Solana, increasing its market position. We are so back!

Jump into the full report now ⬇️ pic.twitter.com/AzOZhiAib5 — Messari (@MessariCrypto) December 16, 2024 The introduction of a spot ETF might result in considerable financial inflows, placing Solana as a viable competitor to other cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin and Ethereum. Moreover, ongoing improvements to Solana’s infrastructure are anticipated to augment its performance. Jump Trading’s Firedancer client pledges to enhance transaction velocities and network scalability. The preliminary implementation has commenced, with complete deployment anticipated in 2025. This enhancement will broaden client alternatives while bolstering network security by reducing dependence on a singular codebase. Institutional Interest And Market Sentiment Reflecting the increasing institutional interest in Solana, companies like VanEck and Bitwise have lately registered for a spot SOL ETF. This action points to Solana’s unique value proposition as a high-performance blockchain starting to be acknowledged by conventional finance. If this tendency keeps up, many predict SOL’s price would soar to new heights; some even project it may hit $4,000. Solana’s market attitude remains positive, particularly after it just went past the $220 price level. If the movement continues, analysts anticipate SOL will reach its previous all-time high of $263. The combination of increased capital, technological breakthroughs and institutional support fosters Solana’s expansion.

In a new video update, Guy Turner, the host of CoinBureau, tells his 2.57 million YouTube subscribers that the market cap for Pyth Network ( PYTH ) may eventually soar due to its potential to generate massive fee revenue. “In my opinion, Pyth Network is one of the most underrated cryptos there is. That’s because it’s an oracle that provides high-frequency data feeds that blockchains like Solana depend on. In other words, Pyth Network is like Chainlink, and some would argue that it’s better than Chainlink. That’s because Pyth Network technically has its own blockchain called Pyth Net, which could theoretically leverage the PYTH token for fees someday. This could make PYTH bigger than LINK, which is already pretty darn big. For the time being, though, PYTH continues to fly under the radar, which is good news for those looking to get in early, but bad news for those who have already been accumulating for a while.” PYTH is trading for $0.49 at time of writing, up 7% in the last 24 hours. With a market cap of $1.79 billion, PYTH is the 83rd largest crypto project. Meanwhile, LINK is trading for $29.08 at time of writing, up slightly on the day. With a market cap of $18.21 billion, LINK is the 13th largest crypto project.

BTC 5-month price chart | Source: crypto.news BTC’s rally follows President-elect Donald Trump’s proposal to establish a U.S. Bitcoin strategic reserve, a concept that has sparked widespread excitement across markets. Trump’s announcement, made during his speech at the New York Stock Exchange on December 12, aims to position the U.S. ahead of global competitors in the digital asset space. He pointed to the need for America to “do something great with crypto” and to build reserves similar to its existing strategic oil stockpile. The idea of a Bitcoin reserve isn’t entirely new. It was first introduced through the BITCOIN Act, championed by Republican Senator Cynthia Lummis, which envisions the U.S. acquiring 1 million BTC over the next five years to help address the growing $35 trillion national debt. Another major factor driving this surge has been institutional activity, particularly from MicroStrategy, a firm synonymous with aggressive Bitcoin accumulation. In the past week alone, MicroStrategy announced it had purchased $1.5 billion worth of BTC at an average price of $100,386 per coin. This recent acquisition brings its total Bitcoin holdings to 439,000 BTC, valued at around $47 billion. The company’s Bitcoin strategy has paid off immensely, catapulting its market cap from $1.1 billion in 2020 to nearly $100 billion today. Moreover, MicroStrategy’s inclusion in the Nasdaq 100 index, effective next week, is also expected to boost further demand for its stock as funds and ETFs rebalance their portfolios. Meanwhile, Ethereum ( ETH ) hasn’t been left behind in this crypto frenzy. After a period of stagnation, ETH showed strong signs of life, climbing to a seven-day high of $4,106 on December 16—a 6% weekly gain. While Ethereum has faced some minor retracement due to profit booking, it remains steady around the $3,950 mark as of this writing. ETH 6-month price chart | Source: crypto.news Let’s dive deeper into the key developments driving Bitcoin and Ethereum, analyze the macroeconomic indicators shaping this bull run, and see what experts believe could happen in the days to come. Institutional powerplay Bitcoin and Ethereum are both showing strong momentum, but the underlying story becomes clearer when we look at ETF inflows, liquidations, and futures open interest. Spot Bitcoin ETFs have been on a tear this month. Since December began, they’ve seen consistent inflows every single day, adding over $5.16 billion as of Dec. 16. These inflows have pushed the total assets under management for Bitcoin ETFs to $123 billion — a strong signal of confidence, especially from institutional investors. Ethereum ETFs, however, tell a different story. Between their launch on Jul. 23 and Dec. 3, inflows were modest, reaching just $733.6 million. Compared to Bitcoin’s performance, this figure looks miniscule. But momentum has clearly shifted. Since Dec. 4, Ethereum ETFs have seen consistent inflows, adding $1.58 billion in a matter of days, suggesting that investors are warming up to Ethereum, likely encouraged by its price performance and Bitcoin’s strong market lead. Liquidation data adds more context to what’s happening in the market. Over the last 24 hours, as of Dec. 17, $339 million worth of positions were liquidated across the crypto market, with $205 million in longs and $134 million in shorts wiped out. 24-hour liquidation heatmap | Source: CoinGlass For Bitcoin, total liquidations have been around $60 million, with short positions making up the majority at $30 million, compared to $29 million from longs, suggesting that many traders betting against Bitcoin’s rally were forced out of their positions as BTC climbed past $108,000. Ethereum saw even heavier liquidations, totaling $78.5 million, with shorts again taking a larger hit at $52 million, again reflecting how ETH’s recent price push to $4,100 surprised many bearish traders. Meanwhile, Bitcoin’s futures open interest — the total value of outstanding futures contracts — has seen monumental growth . Back in early October, open interest sat at $32 billion. Following Trump’s election victory and the resulting bullish sentiment, that figure grew rapidly, reaching $55 billion by mid-November. Since then, open interest has continued to climb, hitting a massive $70 billion as of December 17. Rising open interest paired with increasing prices is a bullish signal, as it shows new money flowing into the market and traders placing bets on further upside. Put simply, Bitcoin’s rally isn’t running on fumes. ETF inflows are strong, futures activity is rising, and short sellers are being squeezed out of their positions. Ethereum, while slower to catch up, is now benefiting from the same momentum, with growing ETF inflows and shorts being liquidated. Both assets appear to have solid footing for their current uptrends, with institutional money and futures markets aligning to paint a bullish picture. Macroeconomic crosswinds The broader macroeconomic environment is currently a mixed bag, with a weakening U.S. Dollar, rate cut expectations, and political turbulence in Europe creating uncertainty across global markets. The USD, which had been gaining strength for a while, is now stalling. The November Retail Sales figure came in at 0.7%, beating expectations of 0.5%, but it wasn’t enough to inspire confidence . Excluding cars and transportation, growth was a weak 0.2%, below the forecasted 0.4%. Add to that the downward revisions for previous months, and it suggests consumer spending — the engine of the U.S. economy — is slowing. This ties directly to the Federal Reserve. The market expects a 25-basis-point rate cut on Dec. 18 with almost certainty. However, the Fed’s tone has been cautious about 2025. Expectations of aggressive rate cuts in the future are being dialed back, which has kept the Dollar from falling further. A stronger Dollar generally puts downward pressure on riskier assets, including Bitcoin, because investors often see USD as a safer bet. But now that the Dollar’s rally is pausing, it gives crypto some breathing room. At the same time, U.S. industrial production contracted by 0.1% in November when analysts expected growth of 0.3%, which signals that certain sectors of the economy are struggling. Combine that with sluggish equity markets — Asian and European stocks are down, and U.S. futures are sliding by around 1% — and we see a general lack of enthusiasm for traditional investments. Historically, when traditional assets underperform, and inflation remains under control, capital starts flowing into alternatives like Bitcoin. However, an overall bearish outlook can add choppiness and halt the bullish sentiments. Meanwhile, political instability in Germany — where Chancellor Olaf Scholz lost a confidence vote — and lingering economic troubles in France are weakening the Euro. Since the Euro makes up 58% of the U.S. Dollar Index, this directly supports the Dollar. However, global uncertainty often drives investors to look for assets that are independent of governments and central banks, like Bitcoin. Amid this, the U.S. 10-year Treasury yield has pulled back slightly to 4.38%, down from its recent high of 4.43%. If yields continue to fall and rate cuts accelerate, it becomes cheaper to borrow money, and investors will start looking for higher returns elsewhere. Bitcoin and Ethereum could likely benefit in these scenarios because they’re seen as high-return alternatives, especially when confidence in traditional markets is shaky. However, nothing is guaranteed. What do experts think? The ongoing Bitcoin and Ethereum rallies are creating the kind of setup that has historically led to explosive price movements. While the momentum is strong, there are signals investors should watch closely. One of the most key observations is Bitcoin’s tightening supply dynamics. As Quinten pointed out, “BlackRock eating up 9x daily mining supply,” — a clear indication that institutional investors are snapping up Bitcoin faster than it can be mined. BlackRock eating up 9x daily mining supply Supply shock incoming and normies still sleeping Institutional FOMO just starting — Quinten | 048.eth (@QuintenFrancois) December 17, 2024 With spot Bitcoin ETFs now giving institutions easy access to BTC, the supply shock narrative is gaining traction. If institutions continue to accumulate at this rate, a supply squeeze could amplify BTC’s next leg up. Meanwhile, Ethereum is showing its own signs of structural strength. According to Ali Martinez, in previous bull cycles, Ethereum’s parabolic runs occurred when long-term holders shifted from the belief phase into “greed mode.” In the past two bull cycles, #Ethereum $ETH went parabolic when long-term holders shifted into greed mode. Right now, they’re only in the early stages of the belief phase. The big move could still be ahead! pic.twitter.com/warxPOlSFj — Ali (@ali_charts) December 17, 2024 Right now, Ethereum is still in the early stages of belief, suggesting that the big move for ETH may still be ahead, aligning with Ethereum’s recent price performance, as it quietly climbed toward $4,000 after months of stagnation. Adding to this picture is Bitcoin’s MVRV ratio — a widely followed valuation tool. The MVRV ratio compares Bitcoin’s market value (its current market cap) to its realized value (average acquisition price based on on-chain data). Historical patterns show that BTC’s MVRV ratio peaked at 4.7x in 2017 and 4x in 2021. As Presto Research outlines , applying a conservative 3.5x multiple to Bitcoin’s projected realized value of $1.2 trillion by Q3 2025 could put BTC’s network value at $4.2 trillion — or about $210,000 per Bitcoin. However, the path to these price levels won’t be smooth. As Michaël van de Poppe noted, the Federal Reserve’s upcoming meeting introduces a key wildcard. New all-time high for #Bitcoin and a liquidity sweep for $ETH . FED Meeting around the corner, which is likely going to bring a ton of volatility into the markets. I won't be surprised we'll see $110K and $95K in the same week. — Michaël van de Poppe (@CryptoMichNL) December 16, 2024 While a rate cut is expected, the Fed’s commentary could trigger volatility. Bitcoin has often responded sharply to central bank decisions, as monetary policy directly impacts liquidity in financial markets. In Poppe’s words, “I won’t be surprised we’ll see $110K and $95K in the same week.” If Bitcoin’s rally extends further and investor confidence spreads, Ethereum’s historical tendency to lag behind and then catch up could play out again. To put it all together, the current rally has strong foundations: institutional demand, shrinking supply, and improving market sentiment. However, volatility remains a given, especially with the Fed’s decisions looming and macro uncertainties still in play. While the data points to a bullish path, managing risk is key as we move deeper into this cycle. Always remember the golden rule: never invest more than you can afford to lose.

Musk Loves Bitcoin (MUSKBTC), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 13,000% in price in the coming days. This is because MUSKBTC is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Musk Loves Bitcoin can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Musk Loves Bitcoin could become the next viral memecoin. Musk Loves Bitcoin launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Musk Loves Bitcoin on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Musk Loves Bitcoin by entering its contract address – 35GthqqwTd9HokNVfUzGpjsALCJbeUXXeKeJcrPCZsJB – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like MUSKBTC. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Press Releases,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|DOGE|SHIB|SOL,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2024-12-18 01:22:00

A new report from Nikkei details how BTC can sometimes be taxed at as much as 110%, as industry leaders and crypto advocates on the archipelago scramble desperately to get the government’s greasy fingers out of Satoshi’s wallet. According to Microstrategy’s Michael Saylor, it’s only “ paranoid crypto-anarchists ” who are worried about keeping bitcoin and government separate, or being able to use crypto non-custodially and permissionlessly. But for the Japanese, holding bitcoin and other crypto assets has now become a huge liability — thanks solely to the state. If we consult the creator of bitcoin themselves, Satoshi Nakamoto, we see that the whole project was always meant to be electronic cash that doesn’t require a financial institution or third party; this is something now coming to bitter remembrance for those Japanese who had wished for the state to get more involved. How Bitcoin can be taxed at over 100% in Japan Of course there is debate about taxation in pretty much every country. And when it comes down to brass tacks, there is no getting around that it is money taken (usually without one’s express consent) under threat of force, and then spent on whatever the strangers in political office far away want to spend it on. Like it or not, it’s theft. Still, to avoid being caged, most people understandably pay the extortion fees out of self-preservation. But in Japan, things are getting out of control for even the most happily obedient normie. While the leader of the Democratic Party for the People (DPP), Yuichiro Tamaki, has been fighting alongside industry groups to get a separate 20% tax for crypto in place, the country’s new prime minister seems uninterested. PM Shigeru Ishiba recently went so far as to publicly doubt the legitimacy of bitcoin as an asset and to imply that tax reform would be promoting a scam to the public. So the possibility of being taxed at up to 55% on gains in Japan remains in place. But the nightmare doesn’t end there. Enter: the inheritance tax. A new report from Japanese financial media outlet Nikkei details how in some cases, people might be taxed for even more bitcoin value than they got in the first place. The December 18 piece describes how the inheritance tax, combined with other taxes, could result in someone being taxed at 110%. Here’s the hypothetical breakdown: Someone buys 100 BTC in December 2014 (worth 4.6 million JPY). They die in December 2024, leaving the BTC (now valued at 1.437 billion JPY) to their child. The child must pay an inheritance tax maxed out at 55%. The heir then sells the BTC upon inheriting it, and must pay taxes on gains, with the acquisition price still being the original 4.6 million yen. Combine the two 55% taxes and others (inheritance tax, income tax, and local resident tax) and the child is now taxed at a rate higher than the value of the asset itself, or 110%. The article goes on to note that even in cases where less value is involved, rates can still reach 100%, and details that even small gains in crypto can end up being taxed at rates higher than those of stocks. “Even if the profit from selling virtual currency is small, there are many cases where the tax rate is higher than stocks,” the article by Tomoko Ōga states. “If the income amount subject to comprehensive taxation is 3.3 million yen or more but less than 6.95 million yen, the maximum income tax rate is 20% and the local resident tax is 10%, which is higher than the total of 20% for separate declaration taxation.” Perhaps there was something to that permissionless exchange thing after all, but each day the state gets more involved, the very real stakes and threats of punishment are jacked up higher and higher. Thankfully, this results in even more innovation and development of efficient P2P (peer-to-peer) protocols so peaceful people can use their money freely and efficiently, without having to be extorted of their inheritance or pay for war. But then again, maybe they are just being paranoid.

His insights come at a time when the crypto market has experienced significant growth, and after Bitwise released its annual top 10 crypto predictions for the next year. #1 Bitcoin Structured Products Surge Park predicts that by 2025, Bitcoin structured products will see an asset influx of at least $5 billion. He states, “The cold, hard truth is that most private wealth managers and institutions remain hesitant about taking on directional Bitcoin exposure.” Related Reading: Crypto Watchlist: Top 5 Coins To Watch This Week He elaborates that products like buffered notes and principal-protection ETFs will be pivotal in bridging this gap, offering tailored exposure to Bitcoin’s volatility to meet institutional preferences. “I predict that buffered notes, principal-protection ETFs, and similar instruments will unlock a floodgate of new demand, giving institutions access to Bitcoin’s volatility at the price they deserve, customized to their own preferences,” Park remarks. #2 Maple Finance Outpaces BlackRock’s BUIDL With a total value locked (TVL) of approximately $535 million as of his writing, Park believes Maple Finance will surpass BlackRock’s BUIDL project. He argues, “I hold an unapologetic view that decentralized markets, which enable novel financial primitives, will see adoption faster than ‘security tokenization’ projects retrofitting to legacy infrastructure.” Park sees decentralized lending platforms like Maple Finance, which provide institutional-grade services, as the category winners in the near future, potentially aided by favorable regulatory changes under the incoming Trump administration. “Institutional-grade, crypto-asset-backed decentralized lending like Maple Finance remains the most promising near-term category winner, bolstered by potential regulatory tailwinds,” Park forecasts. #3 Emergence Of A New Decentralized Crypto Stablecoin Despite past failures like LUNA, Park anticipates the rise of a new decentralized stablecoin backed by a decentralized strategic reserve. He asserts, “Bitcoin’s role as a reserve asset is now undeniable, spanning corporate balance sheets to nation-states,” but emphasizes the crypto community’s desire for a reserve that is “decentralized free from sovereign whims at all costs.” Related Reading: Crypto Market Hit Hard With $1.7 Billion Liquidated, Largest Event Since 2021 The new stablecoin, he predicts, will leverage heightened transparency and cryptographic proofs, aiming to restore trust and utility in decentralized finance. “Despite the scars left by LUNA, I predict a more robust effort will rise, built with heightened transparency and leveraging the long-awaited arrival of cryptographic proofs. I have some exemplary candidates in mind that can and will lead the way,” he states. These predictions by Park come after the predictions from Bitwise for 2025. The firm has projected Bitcoin to exceed $200,000, driven by institutional investment and ETF inflows. Ethereum and Solana are also expected to reach new all-time highs, further solidifying the growth narrative in the crypto space. Additionally, Bitwise sees 2025 as potentially becoming the “Year of the Crypto IPO,” with several crypto unicorns expected to go public in the US. At press time, Bitcoin traded at $106,794.

This development provides a bullish outlook for the Dogecoin price, which is currently consolidating. However, rival token ETFSwap (ETFS) provides a better opportunity for investors as it will enjoy a 70,000% rally in 18 days. Dogecoin Price Could Replicate 2021 Bull Pattern In an X post , Trader Tardigrade raised the possibility of the Dogecoin price replicating a bullish pattern from the 2021 market cycle. This bullish pattern led to a 30,000% surge in the Dogecoin price back then, suggesting that DOGE could again enjoy such price gains in this market cycle. The analyst’s accompanying chart showed that the Dogecoin price could reach as high as $16 if it replicates the 2021 bull pattern. The chart also showed that the Dogecoin price surge to $16 could happen sometime next year. However, despite this bullish outlook for the Dogecoin price, it looks almost impossible for DOGE to reach this target based on its circulating supply. A Dogecoin price surge to $16 will give DOGE a market cap of $2.3 trillion, which is almost impossible at the moment, considering that the crypto market is just valued at over $2 trillion. Why Investors Should Buy ETFSwap (ETFS) Which Will Rally 70,000% Investors are better off buying the ETFSwap (ETFS) token, which will rally 70,000% in 18 days. This bullish outlook for the token stems from its incredible utility, which is already gaining much attention. ETFS is the native token of the ETFSwap platform, which tokenizes exchange-traded funds (ETFs) and enables them to be traded on-chain. The ETFSwap (ETFS) token provides an easier and more convenient way to trade these traditional assets since investors simply need to convert the token for their desired ETF. This explains why traditional finance (TradFi) investors have been looking to purchase as many coins as possible since ETFS got listed on the Uniswap decentralized exchange (DEX). The massive demand for the token so far will contribute to the projected 70,000% rally in 18 days. This is why investors who have yet to invest need to hurry and buy as many coins as possible to position for this price surge. ETFSwap’s (ETFS) other use cases prove that the token can indeed witness this parabolic rally. The ETFSwap (ETFS) token provides access to crypto assets and other commodities on the ETFSwap platform including gold, silver, rubber, cotton, and crude oil, among others. Users will simply swap the token for their desired asset. This makes portfolio diversification much easier as investors will now be able to gain access to several asset classes in one place. As such, it is best to get ahead of these investors and accumulate as many coins as possible. The ETFS token is deflationary , which is another reason it could easily rally by 70,000% and outperform the Dogecoin price. The ETFSwap (ETFS) team has committed to burning some of the fees earned on the DeFi platform to buy back and burn as many ETFS tokens as possible. This deflationary mechanism makes it easier for the ETFSwap (ETFS) price to surge, especially considering the massive demand that the token is already witnessing. Conclusion The ETFSwap (ETFS) token is set to be listed on major exchanges in the coming weeks. It is best to front-run these listings as the 70,000% rally could begin as soon as these exchanges ETFS. Moreover, these exchanges will begin to accumulate ETFS ahead of the listing, so it is best to hurry and accumulate the coin. Buying the ETFSwap (ETFS) token means that you get to enjoy as much as a 700x return on investment (ROI). This is definitely an opportunity to make life-changing gains and one you shouldn’t pass on in this bull run.

One minute, they’re trending, and the next, they’re surging in price. The meme coin space is as fast-moving as a TikTok trend, and if you’re not careful, you could miss out on the next big thing. Lucky for you, we’re here to make sure that doesn’t happen. Whether you’re looking for the best meme coins to buy now or just trying to keep up with the latest movements in the meme coin world, we’ve got the lowdown on three big players: BTFD Coin, Notcoin, and Book of Meme. Just this week, BTFD Coin hit a major PR milestone, racking up over $4.1 million in presale funds. At a presale price of $0.00013, it’s safe to say that investors are paying attention. And who can blame them? This meme coin isn’t just meme-driven; it has real utility with its upcoming Play-to-Earn (P2E) game, staking rewards, and a community-first mentality. Let’s take a deeper dive into these three coins and find out which one’s the best fit for your portfolio. BTFD Coin: The Meme Coin With Serious Potential If you’re even remotely plugged into the meme coin scene, you’ve probably seen this one popping up everywhere. It’s got the hype, the community, and the momentum to make a serious play in 2025. The BTFD Coin presale is absolutely crushing it, and with over $4.1 million raised, it’s clear that investors are getting in on the ground floor. Now, let’s look at what $8,000 could do for you. At today’s presale price of $0.00013, $8,000 would buy you a whopping 61,538,462 coins. That’s a lot of tokens for a relatively low price. And if the coin even hits a modest target of $0.0006 (still super conservative), your $8,000 investment could shoot up to $36,923. That’s a return of over 460%, just from holding for a few months. Of course, with the P2E game and staking rewards , the upside is even greater. So yeah, if you’re wondering which of the best meme coins to buy now, BTFD Coin is certainly one to watch. Notcoin: Earn Rewards, No Staking Required Next up, we’ve got Notcoin, the meme coin that’s shaking things up in the TON ecosystem. If you’re into Telegram and its growing influence on Web3, then Notcoin might be your next big move. They’ve recently launched their Earn programme, a game-changing initiative that lets users earn rewards just by holding TON-based tokens in their Telegram wallet—no complex staking required. This new twist makes it super easy to earn passive rewards without all the hoops and hurdles usually associated with staking. The Earn program essentially works like a launchpool, rewarding holders of Notcoin and other TON-based tokens by giving them access to airdrops. Think of it like a rewards buffet, where all you have to do is be active and hold the right tokens. Users can earn rewards hourly and even participate in exclusive pools like the Gold, Platinum, and Early Notcoin Staker groups for extra bonuses. For meme coin enthusiasts looking for a way to earn while they sleep, Notcoin’s Earn programme is a no-brainer. Book of Meme: A Surge of Hope for 2025 Now let’s talk about Book of Meme, which has been turning heads lately. This coin has all the potential to skyrocket, with predictions pointing to a $0.04 surge in 2025. Yep, you read that right. If Book of Meme can hit that target, early investors are looking at some serious returns. For reference, it’s trading at $0.008 now, so, yes, that’s a major upside we’re talking about! But what makes Book of Meme stand out? It’s not just about the meme—it’s about the community and the culture behind it. With its solid growth and the influence of meme culture, Book of Meme is one of those coins that could go from zero to hero in a matter of months. Wrap It Up: Which Meme Coin Is Right for You? So, what’s the verdict? When it comes to the best meme coins to buy now, there’s a lot to consider, but the combination of community, utility, and growth potential is key. If you’re after serious growth, BTFD Coin is the frontrunner right now. With its P2E game, staking rewards, and bullish momentum, it’s an entire ecosystem in the making. But hey, if you’re looking for something a bit more passive with rewards, Notcoin’s Earn programme could be just the ticket. And let’s not forget Book of Meme, which might just have the surprise factor for 2025. Whatever you choose, make sure to do your research, and don’t miss out on the chance to get in early on these best meme coins to buy now. Who knows? In a few months, you might just be laughing all the way to the bank. So, what are you waiting for? Sign up for BTFD Coin’s presale today.

With over 10,300 token holders and 350 million $TICS tokens sold, Qubetics is quickly proving itself as one of the best coins to invest in today. At the same time, Litecoin’s growing network strength and Fantom’s upcoming major upgrade are catching the attention of savvy investors. Qubetics is not just about hype; it brings real-world solutions where older platforms fell short. Its 13th presale stage is making waves with solid numbers, a 10% price increase every week, and the potential for massive gains. Meanwhile, Litecoin and Fantom are pushing forward with key updates that strengthen their use cases and future outlook. Qubetics Presale Draws Over 10,300 Holders with Real-Life Applications Qubetics is transforming how people and businesses interact with cryptocurrencies. Its multi-chain Qubetics Wallet combines convenience and innovation, making it easier than ever to manage digital assets across devices like iOS, Android, and desktops. Qubetics isn’t just for crypto enthusiasts—it’s built for everyday use in real-world scenarios. For example, a freelancer working with international clients can receive payments in $TICS tokens, which are automatically converted to stablecoins like USDT or USDC during transactions. This ensures stability for both parties, even as markets shift. Small businesses can also streamline cross-border payments without relying on outdated banking systems. Another standout feature is Qubetics’ virtual and physical debit card integration with Visa and Mastercard. Whether it’s paying for groceries, buying digital subscriptions, or making big-ticket purchases, users can connect Qubetics Wallet to Apple Pay or Google Pay, bridging the gap between traditional payments and crypto. For investors looking for diversification, the Qubetics Marketplace offers access to tokenized assets. Imagine owning a share of a luxury apartment in London or a piece of fine art, all made possible through $TICS tokens. This simplified process opens doors for average investors to tap into high-value markets. The 13th presale stage highlights Qubetics’ rising appeal. With over 10,300 holders and 350 million $TICS tokens sold, the project has already raised $6.9 million. At the current price of $0.0342, analysts predict that $TICS could reach $0.25 by the top crypto presale’s end , delivering a 630.19% ROI. If prices hit $1 post-presale, an investment of $140,000 today could turn into $3,949,092, showcasing immense growth potential. If you want to know more about this project, take a look at this video here . Litecoin Strengthens Its Network and Hash Rate Litecoin (LTC) has been making strong moves lately. In the past month, its price surged by over 50%, bringing renewed investor confidence and pushing the number of wallets in profit to a two-year high. This upward momentum reflects growing trust in Litecoin as a reliable alternative to Bitcoin. Litecoin’s network security is also at its strongest point ever. The hash rate—a key measure of computational power protecting the network—recently hit an all-time high of 1.74 PH/s. This 50% increase shows rising participation from miners, solidifying Litecoin’s resilience and long-term sustainability. However, analysts caution traders to watch for technical patterns, like the “inverse cup and handle,” which could signal short-term pullbacks. Despite this, Litecoin’s fundamentals remain strong, with its growing adoption and robust network positioning it as a staple in the crypto market. Fantom Set to Rebrand with Sonic Upgrade and Faster Speeds Fantom (FTM) is gearing up for a game-changing upgrade with its transition to the Sonic mainnet. This upgrade aims to boost transaction speeds, reduce fees, and improve overall scalability, making Fantom a go-to platform for decentralised applications (dApps) and DeFi projects. Ahead of this upgrade, Fantom saw a 16% price surge, indicating strong market excitement. Analysts note that technical indicators, like the MACD bullish crossover, suggest further gains may be on the horizon. The Sonic upgrade is particularly significant because it enhances Fantom’s ability to handle more transactions at lower costs—key factors for attracting developers and new projects. For users, this upgrade means faster, cheaper transactions, positioning Fantom as one of the most efficient platforms in the DeFi space. By addressing previous scalability concerns, Fantom is set to compete with leading Layer-1 solutions. Conclusion Qubetics, Litecoin, and Fantom are showing impressive developments that make them stand out as some of the best coins to invest in today. Qubetics’ presale success, with over 10,300 holders and 350 million $TICS tokens sold , offers investors a unique opportunity with real-world solutions and massive growth potential. Litecoin’s strengthened network security and rising hash rate highlight its reliability, while Fantom’s Sonic upgrade promises faster transactions and lower fees. Each of these projects is building momentum for the future, making them strong contenders for anyone seeking long-term gains.

Hedera’s Integration with Chainlink Enhances DeFi Capabilities Hedera is enhancing its decentralized finance (DeFi) ecosystem by integrating Chainlink’s Data Feeds and Proof of Reserve on its mainnet. This collaboration aims to provide secure, real-time data essential for DeFi applications, enabling more robust and transparent financial products. The integration is expected to position Hedera as a competitive Layer One (L1) chain in the DeFi space. Additionally, the HBAR Foundation has joined Chainlink SCALE to strengthen developer access to oracle services, further supporting the growth of Hedera’s ecosystem. Cronos’ Pallene Upgrade Boosts Network Performance Cronos has completed the Cronos EVM v1.4.0 Pallene upgrade, significantly enhancing the network’s transaction processing capabilities. This upgrade introduces features that increase transaction execution speed by up to 600 times, positioning Cronos to support emerging AI agents and complex decentralized applications more efficiently. This development underscores Cronos’ commitment to improving scalability and performance, making it a more attractive platform for developers and users seeking high-speed blockchain solutions. Conclusion Qubetics, Hedera, and Cronos are shaking up the blockchain world in their own ways.

Trump Patriot (TRUMPPAT), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 19,000% in price in the coming days. This is because TRUMPPAT is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Trump Patriot can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Trump Patriot could become the next viral memecoin. Trump Patriot launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Trump Patriot on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Trump Patriot by entering its contract address – 9hmvtogFEjzZQMFfJ5Hiq7fQSq7E38mG3Qjb7X42qM6P – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like TRUMPPAT. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Press Releases,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|DOGE|EXCHANGE|SHIB|SOL,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2024-12-18 02:43:00

USDtb Debuts According to the official blog post , the stablecoin’s primary reserve asset, BUIDL, makes up 90% of USDtb’s overall backing, positioning it as the highest BUIDL-backed stablecoin to date. USDtb is independent of Ethena’s USDe, thereby providing users with an alternative stablecoin offering a distinct risk profile. Additionally, USDtb is expected to improve USDe’s resilience in volatile market conditions by potentially serving as a backup asset during periods of negative funding rates. The product has passed extensive audits from leading security firms such as Code4rena, Quantstamp, Cyfrin, and Pashov. It is being considered for inclusion in Spark’s $1 billion Tokenization Grand Prix. Ethena has tapped Copper, Zodia Custody, Komainu, and Coinbase Institutional to serve as custodians for its newly launched USDtb stablecoin. The token’s liquidity will be supported by major providers, including Jump, Cumberland, Amber Group, GSR Markets, and SCB Limited. USDtb’s Impact on Ethena’s Stablecoin Ecosystem José Maria Macedo, co-founder of blockchain research and development firm Delphi Labs, predicts that USDtb will become the largest on-chain tokenized treasury product within a month of its launch. Highlighting the significance for Ethena, Macedo noted that USDtb not only provides a “lower-risk” yield-bearing stablecoin option but also strengthens Ethena’s existing USDe stablecoin. The exec even went on to say that during periods when funding rates fall below treasury rates, Ethena can close out hedging positions and reallocate assets to USDtb. This approach reduces USDe’s exposure to negative funding rate concerns while ensuring that its floor yield matches the treasury rate. Meanwhile, Seraphim Czecker, Ethena’s head of growth, spoke about the impact of USDtb on Ethena’s operations, particularly in bearish market conditions. He explained that prolonged periods of negative funding rates no longer pose a threat to Ethena, as the platform can now allocate capital to its own real-world asset-backed stablecoin, USDtb. This effectively establishes a yield “floor” tied to the T-Bill rate, ensuring a stable APY even in unfavorable market environments. Czecker further highlighted USDtb’s scalability, noting its potential to exceed $100 billion in total value locked (TVL).

Solana Realized Cap Growth Has Slowed Down Recently In a new post on X, Glassnode has discussed about how the recent performance of Solana has stacked up against the two largest coins in the sector. “Looking at price performance, SOL outpaced both ETH and BTC for most of Q4 2024,” notes the analytics firm. “However, since early December, ETH has taken the lead, outperforming the other two assets.” As it stands right now, Bitcoin is up around 18% over the past month, Ethereum 28%, and Solana 3%. Thus, SOL has clearly fallen off after being the market leader just earlier. Related Reading: Bitcoin Top Here? What Historical HODLer Selloff Pattern Says What could be behind this shift in the market? The answer to the question could lie in the capital flows that these cryptocurrencies have recently been observing. In order to estimate the capital flows for the assets, Glassnode has made use of the Realized Cap indicator. The “Realized Cap” refers to an on-chain capitalization model that calculates the total value of any digital asset by assuming that the ‘real’ value of any token in circulation is the price at which it was last transacted on the blockchain. Since the last transfer for any coin is likely to represent the last point at which it changed hands, the price at its time could be considered its cost basis. Thus, the Realized Cap is a sum of the cost basis of all coins in the circulating supply or, more simply, a measure of the total amount of capital that the investors as a whole have put into the cryptocurrency. In this view, changes in the Realized Cap essentially reflect the amount of capital that’s exiting out of or entering into the asset. Below is the chart for the 7-day change in the indicator shared by the analytics firm, which showcases these outflows/inflows happening for Solana and others. From the chart, it’s visible that the 7-day change in the Realized Cap was at notable positive levels between September and early December. Bitcoin and Ethereum also observed capital inflows in this period, but SOL was simply growing at a significantly faster pace. Related Reading: Bitcoin Miners Now In Selling Mode For A Year: Should You Be Concerned? This month, though, the sector has seen a flip as both Bitcoin and Ethereum have pulled ahead of Solana. The earlier higher capital inflows were likely the drivers behind SOL’s outperformance, so with them gone, it makes sense that the top two assets would take over. SOL Price Whereas Bitcoin and Ethereum have enjoyed a surge over the last few days, Solana has been moving in a sideways trajectory as its price is still trading around $221.

It’s not just about a token; it’s about risk, reputation, and trust in the crypto ecosystem. Sun affiliated BiT Global filed a lawsuit against Coinbase and they have submitted a response to it. BiT Global isn’t happy with the delisting. They’ve accused Coinbase of damaging their reputation and profits. Meanwhile, the exchange has made it clear: their priority is user safety, not BiT’s business interests. What’s About wBTC Delisting? Coinbase decided to drop wBTC from its listings after discovering BiT Global now controls the token. What is the problem with that? Well, BiT Global is tied to Justin Sun and he has faced allegations of fraud, market manipulation, and is even under investigation by the FBI. Paul Grewal, Coinbase’s Chief Legal Officer, addressed the situation directly in a tweet. He called BiT’s claims “baseless” and reaffirmed the commitment of the exchange to protect its platform and users. Source : X.com For Coinbase, this connection was a red flag. They use strict reviews to make sure all listed assets meet their safety and integrity standards. To them, wBTC no longer made the cut. But BiT Global claims this move hurts them and wBTC users worldwide. They’ve gone to court to stop the delisting, asking for a Temporary Restraining Order (TRO). Coinbase’s Defense: Facts Over Fears Coinbase’s legal team isn’t holding back. In their response , they pointed out that BiT delayed filing the TRO until days before wBTC’s delisting. If it was so urgent, why wait? They also argued that the delisting wouldn’t make much of a dent. Less than 1% of global wBTC trading happens on Coinbase. So even if they delist it, the impact on the market is tiny. And the bigger issue? Reputation. According to Coinbase, any damage to wBTC’s trust didn’t start with their decision. It started with Justin Sun’s history. Legally, Coinbase stood firm. They said platforms have the right to decide what assets they list. No one can force them to list something they believe puts users at risk. What Comes Next? The case is heading to court on December 18, 2024. Coinbase seems confident in their stance, and they’re sticking to their decision. For BiT Global, this is a tough fight—they’ll need to prove their claims hold water. The outcome could change how crypto platforms handle delistings in the future. But for now, Coinbase has one focus: protecting their platform and the people who use it. This isn’t just another crypto dispute. It’s about setting standards for safety and trust in an unpredictable industry.",News|Exchange News,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|EXCHANGE|MARKET|REGULATION,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2024-12-18 03:20:37

However, XRP has hit reverse after touching $2.71 and is now trading at $2.55 level. XRP has strong support near the $2.40 levels and currently, the market is moving in the right direction and may rise slightly higher. A micro support region has been established between $2.55 and $2.62, though there is no immediate expectation for this level to be tested. The third wave is still unfolding, with a 100% extension reached. The ideal target for this third wave is around $2.81, but support should ideally remain above the current levels. Anything below this would be considered a deeper pullback, but still within the range of micro structures. The third wave is expected to extend higher, followed by waves 4 and 5, which could push XRP to retest its all-time high. However, the structure is currently fragile, and while the price movement is not as impulsive as previous rallies, support levels are holding firm. Breakout to $3.80 on Cards? According to analyst Josh of Crypto World, XRP has solid support around $2, where previous resistance is now acting as support. There haven’t been significant changes for XRP recently, but in the short term, the price is continuing its bullish breakout from a bull flag pattern.

Combining blockchain technology with artificial intelligence, Lightchain AI aims to revolutionize how speed, scalability, and real-world utility coexist. And now, with the Lightchain AI Presale underway, it’s the perfect time to explore why this platform is a game-changer. While Solana (SOL) has gained recognition for its lightning-fast transaction speeds and low fees, Lightchain AI is taking a different path. Instead of simply chasing throughput, it integrates AI-driven features to enhance scalability, security, and usability. Solana may dominate the race for speed, but Lightchain AI is redefining what it means to cross the finish line in the blockchain space. The Allure of Solana: A Blockchain Built for Speed Solana’s Lightning-Fast Network Solana’s architecture, built around Proof of History (PoH), allows it to process up to 65,000 transactions per second (TPS), significantly surpassing many other blockchain platforms. With transaction fees typically under $0.01, Solana has become an appealing choice for both developers and users. Its core advantages include efficient scalability, enabling support for a wide range of applications from DeFi to gaming, a developer-friendly ecosystem that attracts innovative projects with its growing set of tools and resources, and cost-effectiveness, making it ideal for microtransactions and dApps. Challenges Under the Hood Despite its impressive performance, Solana faces several challenges. Its network downtime has been a recurring issue, raising concerns about reliability. Additionally, critics point to centralization concerns, arguing that its validator structure leans more centralized, potentially conflicting with the decentralized principles of blockchain. Moreover, while Solana excels in speed, it lacks the advanced functionalities required for AI-driven or industry-specific applications, which limits its broader use case potential. Lightchain AI: Transforming Speed into Smart Efficiency A New Breed of Blockchain While Solana focuses on transaction volume, Lightchain AI’s AI-enhanced blockchain takes a more holistic approach. The platform introduces cutting-edge innovations like Proof of Intelligence (PoI) and the Artificial Intelligence Virtual Machine (AIVM) to not only deliver speed but also integrate real-world intelligence into its core operations. Why Lightchain AI Stands Out: Intelligent Consensus: PoI rewards nodes for meaningful computations, transforming validation processes into productive AI tasks. Adaptability: AIVM’s architecture dynamically scales resources based on workload demand, ensuring consistent performance. Broad Applicability: From healthcare to predictive analytics, Lightchain AI caters to a diverse range of industries. A Tale of Two Titans: Solana vs. Lightchain AI Transaction Throughput vs. AI Integration While Solana dominates transaction speeds, Lightchain AI introduces capabilities that Solana’s architecture cannot match: PoH vs. PoI: Solana’s Proof of History timestamps transactions for speed, while Lightchain AI’s Proof of Intelligence utilizes AI-driven computations for validation, merging utility with consensus. Static vs. Dynamic Processing: Solana excels in high-speed transactions but lacks the adaptability of Lightchain AI’s resource allocation. Scalability Without Compromise Solana’s scalability is often hampered during network congestion, a challenge Lightchain AI addresses through: Parallel Processing: Tasks are distributed across multiple nodes to maintain high throughput. Dynamic Resource Allocation: Lightchain AI optimizes computational power based on real-time demand, avoiding bottlenecks. Lightchain AI in Action: Real-World Applications 1. AI-Powered DeFi Innovation Lightchain AI enhances decentralized finance ( DeFi ) with predictive models that: Optimize Risk Assessment: Real-time analytics improve lending and trading protocols. Enable Smarter Investments: AI tools offer insights for yield farming and portfolio management. 2. Intelligent NFTs Lightchain AI is pushing the boundaries of non-fungible tokens ( NFTs ) by: Creating Adaptive Assets: NFTs evolve based on user behavior or real-world events. Integrating AI Features: Supports interactive collectibles for gaming and art. 3. Healthcare and Logistics From diagnosing diseases to improving supply chains, Lightchain AI’s AIVM is a game-changer: Medical Insights: AI enhances imaging analysis and predictive healthcare models. Transparent Supply Chains: Improves efficiency and accountability through data-driven tracking. The Future of Blockchain: Lightchain AI’s Vision Lightchain AI goes beyond traditional metrics of blockchain success by introducing AI-enhanced capabilities that redefine what’s possible. Its ability to combine speed, precision, and adaptability makes it a trailblazer in the blockchain revolution. What Sets Lightchain AI Apart: Real-World Impact: Industry-specific applications that solve tangible problems. Sustainability: Energy-efficient mechanisms reduce the environmental footprint. AI-Powered Solutions: Tools and features that extend beyond financial applications.

Coinbase’s chief legal officer Paul Grewal confirmed this in an X post : We’ve filed our response to BiT Global’s effort to stop our delisting of wBTC before any discovery or even formal response to their bogus claims. We explain why this lawsuit lacks merit and why their request for a TRO should be denied. ~ Paul Grewal The legal debacle occurred during transition maintenance for wBTC from BitGo to BiT Global and its Singaporean satellite. In August, BitGo stated that, in a bid to enhance the resilience of its protocol, it was sharing two of the three wBTC keys with those two firms. Coinbase acted on the concerns of crypto players BiT Global argued in its submission that Coinbase is simply promoting a rival tokenized Bitcoin product, cbBTC. They claimed Coinbase has resorted to defamatory remarks to instil fear and doubt about wBTC’s regulatory position and stability. However, Coinbase has maintained that their reaction comes from the concerns of the users. Mr. Sun has had regulatory issues and has been accused of market manipulation. This has contributed to Coinbase taking relevant measures. Under the arrangement between BitGo and BiT Global’s two entities, BitGo will be in charge of operations, as the two BiT Global firms hold collaterals for wBTC. BiT Global accuses Coinbase of violating federal laws over wBTC delisting Coinbase has stated that BiT Global wants to force it into business with an entity that is non-compliant with its standards due to Mr Sun’s material involvement. Yet, they need more audacity to mention Sun’s connection to the complaint and TRO request. BiT Global holds that Coinbase has breached several federal and state laws in its attempt to delist wBTC. Among the breached laws are the Sherman Act and the Lanham Act, which prohibits unfair monopolies.

Meanwhile, Pudgy Penguins (PENGU), a token launched just yesterday, recorded a remarkable 550% surge within 24 hours, propelling it into the top 100 cryptocurrencies by market cap. Bitget Token (BGB) also experienced a strong uptick, climbing 17% despite a broader market dip. The overall market cap declined by approximately 1% to $3.71 trillion, while trading volumes fell by 8.6% to $185 billion. The Fear and Greed Index signaled extreme greed, reading 80. So, let’s take a closer look at some of the leading cryptocurrencies by market cap and their price action on December 18. Crypto Prices Today: Market Tackles Turbulence But Some Alts Soar The crypto market showed a mixed reaction, with Bitcoin and Ethereum down by 1% to 3%. However, U.S.-based projects like XRP, Stellar (XLM), and Hedera (HBAR) surged by 3% to 6% over the last 24 hours, reflecting positive momentum among select altcoins despite the broader market dip. Bitcoin Price Today The Bitcoin (BTC) price dropped by 1% and was trading at $105,368. Its 24-hour low and high were $105,004 and $108,269, respectively. The market cap stood at $2.09 trillion, with $70 billion in trading volume. Its market dominance was recorded at 56.63%. As per SoSo Value , BTC ETFs saw an outflow of 247 million BTC on Tuesday, with Fidelity leading the outflows at 128 million BTC.

In crypto prices today, XRP’s market cap is $146 billion, with a trading volume of $17 billion, making it the third-largest cryptocurrency by market cap. Additionally, Ripple’s stablecoin RLUSD went live yesterday, marking Ripple’s entry into the stablecoin market.

Other notable meme coins like PEPE, BONK, and WIF have dropped by 2% to 6%. These movements reflect the trend in crypto prices today, as the meme coin market faces a correction amid broader market fluctuations. Top Crypto Gainer Prices Today Pudgy Penguins Pudgy Penguins (PENGU) became the top gainer for today, surging by 550% in the last 24 hours. The price skyrocketed after Binance launched it yesterday . Currently, PENGU is trading at $0.03, with a 24-hour low of $0.02 and a high of $0.06. Bitget Token Bitget Token (BGB) continues its strong performance, marking the second consecutive day as a top gainer. Today, it’s up by 17%, currently trading at $4.18. Its 24-hour low and high range between $3.56 and $4.23. The rise in price is attributed to Bitget, the leading cryptocurrency exchange, being granted a license to operate as a Bitcoin service provider by El Salvador’s Central Bank . Litecoin Litecoin (LTC) was up by approximately 7% in the last 24 hours and is currently trading at $125. Its 24-hour low and high were $114 and $129. The rise in price is mainly attributed to predictions from Bloomberg analysts that a Litecoin ETF could launch sooner than those for Solana and XRP. As seen in crypto prices today, Litecoin’s growth is notable amid broader market trends. Top Crypto Loser Prices Today Lido DAO Lido DAO (LDO) price was down by 9% and is currently trading at $2.08. Its 24-hour low and high were $2.05 and $2.31, making it the worst performer for today. In crypto prices today, Lido DAO’s decline stands out amidst other market movements.

Crypto prices today reflect a slight dip for Fantom. Besides, the hourly chart shows a bearish trend, with Bitcoin down by half a percent, and major altcoins like XRP, Solana (SOL), and Binance Coin (BNB) down by approximately 1% in the last hour. This indicates short-term selling pressure across the market.

Derek Merrin, the Leader of the Ohio House Republicans, introduced the bill. Derek Merrin, who was the former Mayor of Waterville, took to X to announce that House Bill 703, filed this week, would enable the state treasurer to invest in Bitcoin ( BTC ) in order to create an “Ohio Bitcoin Reserve” in the state treasury. His thought behind introducing the bill was that incorporating BTC into the state’s investment portfolio could help hedge against the slow erosion of the purchasing power of the U.S. dollar, thereby helping to retain the value of public funds across generations.

Advocates like Cynthia Lummis argue that with BTC gaining acceptance as a form of payment by large businesses and even government agencies in some instances, including it in state reserves would enhance a state’s financial strength. Further, this could push forward more corporate adoption for digital assets, legitimizing its position in global finance, according to Matthew Sigel, who heads the Digital Assets Research wing of VanEck .

Most of Ohio’s debt consists of general obligation bonds and special obligation bonds issued to fund infrastructure projects, education, and other public projects. As a result, if Ohio can now add BTC to its treasury reserves, the state would likely improve its long-term financial solvency. In time, such a strategy could brighten Ohio’s fiscal picture, easing the pressure to raise taxes or cut services and putting the state in a much better position to fulfill such obligations.

A nonprofit focused on government accountability, they questioned Hinman, who served as the SEC’s Division of Corporation Finance director from 2017 to 2020. The group found documents suggesting Hinman may have violated ethics rules about conflicts of interest and sent evidence to the SEC’s Office of Inspector General in May 2022. In February 2024, the SEC’s inspector general said the investigation was almost finished. The report could support their investigation before Clayton is confirmed as U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of New York. What Did Hinman Say in His Controversial 2018 Speech? In 2018, Hinman gave a high-profile speech stating that Ethereum’s digital token, Ether, was not a security, which led to an immediate rise in Ether’s price. This raised questions about whether Hinman violated the law by promoting Ether while having financial conflicts of interest. “Based on my understanding of the present state of Ether, the Ethereum network and its decentralized structure, current offers and sales of Ether are not securities transactions,” he had said. Outside groups, including Consumer Action for a Strong Economy (CASE), have continued to push the SEC to release the report. Pro-XRP lawyer John Deaton wrote, “TIME TO RELEASE THE REPORT @GaryGensler If we are going to move forward – we do so with complete TRANSPARENCY. If Gensler doesn’t release this report, Paul Atkins needs to do so immediately. @HesterPeirceand others should be calling for its release.” XRP vs SEC: The issue also revolves around a lawsuit filed on December 22, 2020, during the final days of the Trump administration. SEC Chairman Jay Clayton and William Hinman, Director of the SEC’s Division of Corporation Finance, sued Ripple Labs, its co-founder Chris Larsen, former CEO and executive chairman, and current CEO Brad Garlinghouse. The lawsuit accused them of selling $1.3 billion worth of XRP cryptocurrency as unregistered securities. Tristan Leavitt, in his 22-page letter, wrote how SEC commissioner Joseph Grundfest felt SEC’s actions against XRP were problematic. Grundfest wrote to the SEC and said, “The staff has articulated no material distinction between the operation of Ether and of XRP that is relevant to the application of the federal securities laws. Imposing securities law obligations on XRP while leaving Ether untouched raises fundamental fairness questions about the exercise of Commission discretion Ether and XRP should be treated similarly.",News|Crypto news|Ripple (XRP),EN,0,0,ETH|REGULATION|TRADING|XRP,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2024-12-18 04:02:28

Santa Rides Shiba (SANTSHIB), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 19,000% in price in the coming days. This is because SANTSHIB is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Santa Rides Shiba can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Santa Rides Shiba could become the next viral memecoin. Santa Rides Shiba launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Santa Rides Shiba on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Santa Rides Shiba by entering its contract address – CxpeR8vdgeVWZFwBytS7PRrXHBwVgPJWZBJUcpK3k7vT – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like SANTSHIB. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Press Releases,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|DOGE|EXCHANGE|SHIB|SOL,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2024-12-18 04:05:00

Over the past week, Bitcoin’s trading volume and market cap have shown consistent growth, signalling rising interest among institutional investors. According to CoinDesk’s latest report, Bitcoin’s trading volumes soared by 18% as the crypto broke through its previous resistance levels. Analysts point out that the renewed focus on Bitcoin ETFs and institutional adoption is fuelling this momentum. For example, BlackRock recently hinted at accelerating its plans for Bitcoin ETF approval, which could bring billions of fresh investments into the asset. Additionally, El Salvador’s Bitcoin strategy has seen a new surge in returns, highlighting the coin’s long-term value. On-chain data also shows that whales are accumulating Bitcoin again, suggesting bullish sentiment heading into the next halving cycle. For those keeping their eyes on stable investments, Bitcoin remains an anchor in the volatile market. Its growing adoption as digital gold and institutional backing makes it an essential part of a strong crypto portfolio. ZIGnaly Boosts Traders’ Earnings with Strategic Updates ZIGnaly is making strides in helping retail and pro traders level up their crypto earnings. This copy trading platform recently reported a 25% increase in user base after rolling out its latest AI-powered trading bots. The platform allows investors to mirror the trades of top-performing traders, which has gained massive traction among beginners looking to automate their crypto strategies. Earlier this week, ZIGnaly announced an upgrade to its profit-sharing model, reducing platform fees and increasing trader payouts by 12%. This move aims to attract more expert traders to the platform, creating win-win opportunities for both sides. Moreover, ZIGnaly’s native token saw a notable uptick after its integration with leading blockchains like Binance Smart Chain (BSC) and Ethereum. This opens doors for smoother liquidity and faster transaction speeds—critical features that ZIGnaly needed to stay competitive. For investors seeking reliable utility-driven platforms, ZIGnaly remains one of the best coins to invest in this month. Conclusion: Why These Are the Best Coins to Invest in This Month Qubetics, Bitcoin, and ZIGnaly each bring something valuable to the table for crypto investors. Bitcoin continues to deliver unmatched stability, solidifying its role as the cornerstone of every portfolio. ZIGnaly’s innovative platform upgrades make it a strong contender for traders seeking automated, profitable solutions.

With Bitcoin hitting record highs, important figures like Senator Cynthia Lummis and Dennis Porter are pushing hard to make it happen. The plan is to make Bitcoin a part of U.S. fiscal policy. This could help strengthen the U.S. dollar and even improve national security. It’s a bold idea that could completely reshape how America handles money. Cynthia Lummis and Her Vision for Bitcoin Cynthia Lummis, the Wyoming Senator, has been a Bitcoin supporter for a long time. She sees Bitcoin not just as a cryptocurrency, but as something that could help secure America’s financial future. She’s backing a proposal to turn part of the U.S. gold reserves into Bitcoin. Lummis argues this would save the government billions and give the dollar a much-needed boost. Source : X.com But she’s not in this alone. David Sacks, a venture capitalist who’s been named the “ Crypto Czar ,” is working alongside her to push for a new law that would make Bitcoin a key part of the U.S. reserves. This partnership is all about making sure the economy stays strong, even as we head into a more digital age. Dennis Porter and the Executive Order Dennis Porter, the CEO of Satoshi Action Fund, shared the first page of an Executive order via an X post. This EO could pave the way for the Strategic Bitcoin Reserve. This will allow the U.S Treasury to manage BTC as a reserve asset along with the dollar and gold. MASSIVE BREAKING: I can confirm that my team has finalized a model EXECUTIVE ORDER for the president of the United States to establish a ‘Strategic Bitcoin Reserve’ pic.twitter.com/rz3issLf2H — Dennis Porter (@Dennis_Porter_) December 17, 2024 The executive order also proposes taking around 200,000 Bitcoin—seized in criminal cases and worth about $20 billion—and using them as part of this reserve. Instead of selling these assets at auction, they would be put to work for national financial stability. To ensure transparency, the Treasury would oversee Bitcoin with robust security and conduct regular audits. What’s Next for Bitcoin in U.S. Reserves? If the plan goes ahead, the Strategic Bitcoin Reserve could have a major impact on the U.S. economy. It might help cut down the national debt, protect the country from inflation. It can even make the dollar more competitive on the global stage. Beyond that, it could give the U.S. a stronger negotiating position against economic powers like China and Russia. While the proposal sounds promising, it’s clear that challenges remain.

According to data shared by CryptoQuant analyst Avocado Onchain, spot market demand has emerged as a significant driving force behind Bitcoin’s ongoing price increases. This trend indicates growing buying pressure from long-term investors, as speculative activity in the futures market appears to be cooling. Related Reading: Bitcoin’s Next Big Move? Key Metric Reveals When to Cash In Profits Bitcoin Spot Market Demand Gains Strength The analyst’s observations provide insights into Bitcoin’s ongoing bull cycle, which began in the first half of 2023. According to Avocado, initially, the futures market led the charge in pushing Bitcoin’s price upward, signalling a speculative phase fuelled by short-term traders. However, this momentum was interrupted earlier this year when both the futures and spot markets experienced reduced trading activity starting in March. Since October, market activity has returned, with trading volumes rising across both futures and spot markets, providing fresh support for Bitcoin’s rally. In his analysis, Avocado Onchain noted a key trend: while futures market activity has recently declined, demand in the spot market has been steadily increasing. Spot market activity refers to the actual purchase of Bitcoin on exchanges for immediate delivery, typically driven by investors with a long-term perspective. This stands in contrast to futures markets, where traders speculate on price movements using contracts that do not require immediate ownership of the asset. Spot Market Demand Takes the Lead as Bitcoin Continues Its Upward Momentum “While futures market activity has declined, spot market demand continues to increase.

Historically, overheated futures markets have led to volatility, often triggering liquidations. However, the cooling of futures market activity, coupled with rising spot market demand, reflects a more sustainable form of buying pressure that can underpin Bitcoin’s long-term growth. The CryptoQuant analyst noted: Looking ahead, the futures market is likely to undergo cycles of overheating and liquidations, which will contribute to Bitcoin’s price growth. This price movement will, in turn, encourage further capital inflows into the spot market. Additionally, Avocado Onchain pointed to the 30-day exponential moving average (EMA) of Bitcoin’s funding rate, which shows “no signs of late-cycle overheating.” Related Reading: Bitcoin To Hit $180,000 If These Cycle Top Indicators Are Absent, Says VanEck’s Sigel The funding rate measures the cost of holding futures contracts and is often used as an indicator of market sentiment. Avocado mentioned that as BTC funding rate remains balanced, it suggests that BTC’s price movements are not being driven solely by leveraged positions, reducing the risk of sudden price reversals.

According to Fox Business’ Eleanor Terrett, a Senate aide confirmed that the Senate Banking Committee’s scheduled vote on her nomination has been canceled. Crenshaw, who was known for her anti-crypto stance, even opposed the approval of the Bitcoin spot ETF, issuing a dissent. This victory is seen as a step forward for the crypto community, with many expecting a pro-crypto shift in the SEC under new leadership. Crypto advocates flooded the Senate with 107,000 emails opposing Crenshaw’s renomination, showing the strength of the industry’s voice. Additionally, Senator Cynthia Lummis predicts that 2025 will be a major year for Bitcoin and digital assets, with David Sacks serving as the crypto czar. Crenshaw, appointed to the SEC in 2020 under the Trump administration and later renominated by President Biden, has been a strong ally of SEC Chair Gary Gensler. She is considered even more anti-crypto than Gensler, especially due to her opposition to key crypto policies. With Crenshaw not being renominated as SEC Chair, it significantly boosts the likelihood that the SEC will not continue its pursuit of Ripple Labs. This also opens the door for President Trump to appoint someone new, potentially more favorable to the crypto space. Why Didn’t The Crypto Market React? When an X user remarked that one would have expected this news to affect the market, attorney Fred Rispoli responded, saying, “These kinds of moves are fairly esoteric, and only the most dialed-in crypto folks are following it.

While the crypto industry is no stranger to adversity, this year has seen a surge of optimism regarding its potential. With the re-election of Donald Trump as President of the United States, the global cryptocurrency market has surpassed a valuation of $3 trillion for the first time in over three years. This resurgence is driven by a demand for Bitcoin and other digital assets, coinciding with the new administration’s policies and market sentiment. With the clouds starting to part, regulatory clarity and infrastructural progress have emerged as two key factors driving the industry’s successes and hard-earned legitimacy. This shift has fueled a steady influx of VC (venture capital) investments over the course of 2024, signaling the market is both maturing and preparing for a major breakout. So, how can startups take advantage of 2025’s fresh possibilities to garner VC attention? The answer lies in reflecting on the past year. Gains of 2024 This year welcomed a new level of maturity for the crypto sector, with some of the most successful projects prioritizing security, compliance and building trust with investors and the broader Web 3.0 community. Just two weeks into the year, the approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs supercharged market confidence, attracting institutional and retail investors. But why? The move legitimized Bitcoin in the eyes of skeptics, fueling interest in crypto to the general public and driving gradual price gains. By making Bitcoin more accessible through traditional financial markets, the approval opened the gates for larger institutional investments , which had previously been cautious about direct exposure to the crypto market. And now, Trump’s re-election has produced a market surge, with Bitcoin prices reaching a historic high, surging over 129% in 2024. While the specifics of Trump’s crypto policy remain uncertain, he is widely anticipated to be a strong ally to the industry, fueling optimism for what lies ahead. One of the most welcomed developments over the last 12 months has been the convergence between crypto and AI . While it was always clear that these two transformative technologies would eventually intersect, few could have predicted the speed and scale at which they merged – a nd the surface of what’s possible is only just being scratched. While there is no crystal ball to predict exactly what’s coming next year, startups can use 2024 as a compass, pinpointing which trends will be on VCs radar. Solving scalability through infrastructure For startups looking to scale successfully, one of the most critical areas to address is the infrastructure sector, particularly in the ongoing development and scaling of Ethereum’s ecosystem. As Ethereum continues to grow rapidly, scalability remains a major barrier, making it a key focus for VCs looking to invest in solutions that can handle high-volume transactions efficiently. Layer-two solutions are becoming increasingly essential in addressing the challenges facing Ethereum , and VCs are keen to support startups in developing the infrastructure needed to enhance the network’s efficiency, security and accessibility. Pioneering privacy solutions with AI and blockchain In 2025, AI and blockchain are set to significantly advance data privacy, addressing concerns highlighted by copyright lawsuits involving several high-profile companies . Innovations such as FHE (fully homomorphic encryption) and federated learning are set to pave the way for privacy-preserving AI training. Startups combining AI and blockchain to safeguard privacy while creating value for users are positioned to attract investor attention. In particular, solutions that allow individuals to maintain control over their data and be compensated for its use could disrupt traditional data-sharing models, creating new business opportunities. Beyond privacy, there are clear challenges in AI that Web 3.0 could help address, including improving accessibility and democratization, creating pathways for monetization and ownership and fostering incentives for open contributions. While the future remains uncertain, the growth of consumer adoption and institutional investment is likely to strengthen the foundations of the crypto industry and drive sustainable progress. In the coming year, we expect VCs to deepen their commitments, focusing on building long-term value while supporting talented founders whose solutions will drive the next wave of innovation. The rise of PayFi While DeFi has made steady progress, its full integration into traditional financial systems is still unfolding. Interest in DeFi is on the rise, and in 2025, the focus will shift towards PayFi (payment finance). First introduced last July, PayFi leverages blockchain as a settlement layer, using Web 3.0 payments and DeFi protocols to create more transparent, cost-effective and efficient financial transactions. For VCs, investing in PayFi startups presents an opportunity to be involved in the next wave of financial innovation, which is set to reshape the relationship between crypto and TradFi (traditional finance). Increasing focus on real-world assets for investment opportunities Tokenized RWAs (real-world assets) are quickly becoming a popular investment. By 2030, the market for tokenized RWAs is projected to reach $16 trillion , as companies are looking to bring more traditional asset classes onto blockchain platforms. ANZ, one of Australia’s top four banks, recently partnered with Singapore’s Project Guardian to explore tokenizing RWAs, which is an example of an institution looking to expand access to a wider range of asset classes. VCs should look out for projects innovating in this space, as tokenized RWAs allow even those with limited capital to participate in substantial ventures, opening opportunities for financial growth and stability, Bringing stablecoins and TradFi together As blockchain continues to align with TradFi, the stablecoin market will be a pivotal sector to watch. VCs should be keenly interested in the growing stablecoin market, particularly as major players recently announced new initiatives that will allow banks to issue stablecoins and other fiat-backed tokens internationally. Stablecoins, alongside payments and yield protocols, are expected to play a central role in the continued Web 3.0 expansion by providing stable, scalable and interoperable solutions for DeFi applications. They help to ensure seamless value transfer, which has the potential to help foster greater adoption across markets globally. As new projects enter the DeFi playing field, VCs will continue to intensify their investments, prioritizing the creation of long-term value and continue backing founders whose solutions are set to fuel and lead the next wave of progress in the blockchain and Web 3.0 ecosystem.

This day has also been designated as the initial distribution record date for those holding allowed claims in the plan’s convenience classes. Distribution Details According to a press release , payments for these claims are expected to begin within 60 days of the plan’s effective date. In line with this, recipients must complete know-your-customer (KYC) procedures and fulfill other distribution requirements, including submitting tax forms. This first round of payments will only apply to the convenience classes, with FTX noting that separate records and payment dates for other classes of claims will be announced later. The court-approved reorganization plan, finalized in October 2024, received overwhelming support from creditors, who stand to recover an average of 119% of the value of their claims. Furthermore, under the terms of the initiative, some will receive up to 140% in cash. FTX estimates that total recoveries will range between $14.7 billion and $16.5 billion. These repayments have been made possible through efforts to reclaim assets from various parties, including the U.S. Department of Justice and international regulators. The company’s CEO, John J. Ray III, highlighted that the latest development demonstrated the significant success of the recovery efforts. “For the past two years, our team of professionals have meticulously and efficiently worked to recover billions of dollars to reach this point.” He added that FTX is now in a strong position to begin reimbursing funds to customers and creditors. He also encouraged claim holders to ensure they complete all the necessary steps to avoid delays in receiving their payments. Distribution Agents and FTX Convictions To support the distribution process, the defunct exchange has partnered with two crypto custodians, BitGo and Kraken. The duo will help disburse the funds to both retail and institutional customers as well as other claimants in supported jurisdictions. FTX’s bankruptcy filing in late 2022 was one of the most significant collapses in the crypto industry. It was marked by several high-profile sentences, including the November 2023 conviction of former CEO Sam Bankman-Fried on charges of wire fraud and conspiracy, resulting in a 25-year imprisonment. In May 2024, FTX Digital Markets co-CEO Ryan Salame was sentenced to 7.5 years in prison, while Caroline Ellison, the former head of Alameda Research, received a two-year prison term. Two other executives, Nishad Singh and Gary Wang, avoided prison altogether.

According to a Bloomberg report the bank launched its test version of Project Dama 2, an asset servicing pilot, in November. This platform’s layer two system relies on public blockchains to provide a more affordable and efficient transaction. Boon-Hiong Chan, a Deutsche Bank Asia-Pacific innovation lead, said that the bank’s Layer 2 connects to Ethereum, one of the blockchain’s busiest networks. Deutsche Bank sees blockchain as a means to deal with margin pressures in financial services Chan explained that public blockchains such as Ethereum pose risks to regulated banks. The risks include uncertainty regarding who is performing the validation of transactions, the possibility of paying fees to sanctioned entities, and the possibility of unexpected changes to the blockchain. Chan added “Using two chains, a number of these regulatory concerns should be able to be satisfied.” Project Dama 2 is one of several initiatives in Singapore’s Project Guardian, where 24 major financial institutions are looking to tokenize assets via blockchain. Deutsche Bank, among other advocates, sees blockchain as a means to deal with margin pressures in financial services. But there are still questions as to how far banks should go in the crypto world.

Over the years, their popularity has skyrocketed, driven by community engagement, viral marketing, and a sprinkle of good old-fashioned internet humour. Today, we’re diving into three standout contenders in this space: BTFD Coin , Book of Meme, and Snek. These projects are not just riding the meme coin wave; they’re innovating gameplay, turning pages, and sneaking up in value. Each of these coins showcases exceptional potential for returns, making them some of the best meme coins to invest in December 2024. BTFD Coin is particularly noteworthy due to its innovative play-to-earn (P2E) gaming mechanics and staking rewards. This coin isn’t merely about memes; it’s about building a robust community and giving back to its holders. With a presale that launched on November 26, 2024, BTFD Coin is setting the stage for something big. Analysts are buzzing with excitement, predicting a significant increase in value as the presale progresses. With each stage, the anticipation grows, and potential investors are keen to jump on board before it’s too late. As for the presale itself, BTFD Coin has already raised over $4.1 million, hitting the $1 million mark in under ten days and $2.5 million in just fourteen days. This kind of traction is hard to ignore, especially when you consider the low entry price of $0.000004 per coin. With a projected listing price of $0.0006 post-presale, the potential for profit is substantial. It’s a prime example of why this coin is among the best meme coins to invest in December 2024. BTFD Coin: Innovating the Meme Coin Space BTFD Coin is making waves in the meme coin arena, primarily through its unique approach to gameplay and community engagement. The integration of a play-to-earn model not only attracts gamers but also incentivises participation within its ecosystem. Imagine earning rewards while playing games that resonate with the meme culture—it’s a win-win situation. This innovative approach aligns perfectly with the current trends in the crypto space, where gamification is becoming increasingly popular. The presale dynamics of BTFD Coin add another layer of excitement. Since its launch, the coin has surged through multiple presale stages, showcasing a healthy demand. Currently, it’s in its 12th stage, priced at $0.00013. With over 56 billion $BTFD coins sold and more than 5,700 holders, the community backing this coin is robust. Investors are flocking to BTFD Coin, eager to secure their stake in a project that’s not just about memes but about real utility and engagement. Now, let’s talk numbers. An investment of $150,000 during Stage 5, priced at $0.00005 per coin, would yield 3 billion $BTFD coins. When the price hits the projected $0.0006 at the end of the presale, that investment would translate to a whopping $1.8 million. That’s the kind of growth that gets investors buzzing, making BTFD Coin a frontrunner among the best meme coins to invest in December 2024. Book of Meme: Turning a New Page Next up is the Book of Meme, a project that’s creatively leveraging the meme culture to build a community and increase value. It’s a fresh take on the traditional meme coin concept, focusing on storytelling and user-generated content. The idea is simple yet powerful: users create and share memes, and the best ones are rewarded with tokens. This not only enhances community interaction but also incentivises creativity. The Book of Meme aims to turn the conventional narrative of meme coins on its head. Instead of merely relying on hype, it fosters a culture where users feel invested in the platform’s success. This model is particularly appealing to younger audiences who thrive on social media engagement and creativity. By gamifying the meme creation process, Book of Meme is carving out a unique place in the crypto landscape. Investors are taking notice of the potential for substantial returns. With its innovative approach, the Book of Meme is positioned as one of the best meme coins to invest in December 2024. Its community-driven model is not just about making a quick buck; it’s about building a sustainable ecosystem where everyone can thrive. As the project continues to grow, so too does the excitement around its future potential. Snek: Sneaking Upwards Finally, we have Snek, a meme coin that’s been quietly gaining traction. While it may not have the same level of mainstream attention as BTFD Coin or Book of Meme, Snek is steadily sneaking its way into the hearts of crypto enthusiasts. This coin is all about community, often leveraging humour and internet culture to create a loyal following. Snek’s appeal lies in its simplicity and relatability. It doesn’t try to overcomplicate things with grandiose promises; instead, it focuses on building a strong community. This grassroots approach can lead to organic growth, which is often more sustainable than hype-driven models. As more people discover Snek and its engaging community, the potential for upward movement in value becomes increasingly likely. The current market sentiment is highly favourable, and many analysts are predicting that Snek could be one of the best meme coins to invest in December 2024. As it continues to build its following and enhance its community engagement, investors are starting to take it seriously. Snek’s value might not skyrocket overnight, but its steady ascent could yield impressive returns for those who get in early. Conclusion Based on our research and market trends, it’s clear that the landscape of meme coins is evolving, and BTFD Coin, Book of Meme, and Snek are leading the charge. Each of these projects brings something unique to the table, whether it’s innovative gameplay, community-driven content, or a grassroots approach. For anyone looking to dive into the crypto world, these coins represent some of the best meme coins to invest in December 2024. With solid presale performances, robust community backing, and exciting potential for growth, the time to act is now. Don’t miss out on the opportunity to be part of this thrilling market—join the BTFD Coin presale now and secure your place in the future of meme coins!

Musk Loves Bitcoin (MUSKBTC), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 13,000% in price in the coming days. This is because MUSKBTC is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Musk Loves Bitcoin can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Musk Loves Bitcoin could become the next viral memecoin. Musk Loves Bitcoin launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Musk Loves Bitcoin on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Musk Loves Bitcoin by entering its contract address – 35GthqqwTd9HokNVfUzGpjsALCJbeUXXeKeJcrPCZsJB – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like MUSKBTC. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Press Releases,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|DOGE|SHIB|SOL,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2024-12-18 05:22:00

From MicroStrategy’s Bitcoin-centric strategy driving its market cap near $100 billion to US Bitcoin ETFs surpassing gold ETFs in assets under management for the first time, the cryptocurrency is solidifying its position as a formidable contender in institutional investment portfolios. MicroStrategy’s Stellar Year: A 546% Stock Surge Fueled by Bitcoin Holdings MicroStrategy (MSTR) has had a phenomenal year, with its stock price skyrocketing by 546% in 2024, propelling its market capitalization to $99.4 billion. The company’s strategic accumulation of Bitcoin has been a key driver of this unprecedented growth. This year alone, the enterprise software giant added 249,850 BTC to its holdings, bringing its total reserves to an astounding 439,000 BTC — solidifying its position as the largest corporate Bitcoin holder in the world. MicroStrategy’s current market cap is on the verge of surpassing the $100 billion milestone. With this achievement, it would outpace several prominent American companies if Bitcoin reaches higher price benchmarks. For instance, at a Bitcoin price of $138,000, MicroStrategy’s market cap could eclipse Starbucks , valued at $105.5 billion, and even Nike , which boasts a $115 billion valuation. Given its massive Bitcoin holdings, MicroStrategy’s fortunes are closely tied to the price trajectory of BTC. According to its net asset value (NAV) worksheet, the company’s fully diluted market cap stands at $114 billion, with the derived MSTR NAV hovering around $40 billion. MicroStrategy’s BTC-centric strategy means that every $1,000 move in Bitcoin’s price equates to an approximate $440 million change in the company’s market cap. The implications are profound: A modest 11% rally in Bitcoin’s price to $118,810 would push MicroStrategy’s market cap beyond Starbucks. A 32% increase in Bitcoin’s value to $140,000 would allow MicroStrategy to overtake Nike. These calculations assume MicroStrategy refrains from further adding to its Bitcoin reserves, which currently outpace its nearest corporate competitor, Marathon Digital, by an astounding 985%. The High-Stakes Bitcoin Strategy MicroStrategy’s aggressive Bitcoin acquisition strategy has drawn both praise and criticism. The company frequently issues debt to finance its Bitcoin purchases, a move that amplifies its exposure to BTC’s price movements. While this has proven immensely profitable during bullish market conditions, skeptics like Chainlink advocate Zach Rynes have expressed concern over the risks of the debt-based model. However, Ki-Young Ju, CEO of CryptoQuant, remains optimistic about MicroStrategy’s approach. In a recent post on X, he highlighted that Bitcoin has never traded below the cost basis of long-term holders, which currently stands at $30,000. Ju quipped that MicroStrategy would face financial ruin “only if an asteroid hits Earth.” MicroStrategy’s performance in 2024 demonstrates the transformative potential of a Bitcoin-centric investment strategy. Its unprecedented accumulation of BTC not only solidifies its dominance in the cryptocurrency space but also positions it to compete with traditional corporate giants in terms of market capitalization. As Bitcoin continues to rise, MicroStrategy’s future appears intertwined with the cryptocurrency’s trajectory. Whether the company reaches new milestones or grapples with market volatility, one thing remains clear: MicroStrategy has become a bellwether for corporate Bitcoin adoption and the broader integration of crypto into traditional financial markets. Bitcoin ETFs Surpass Gold Funds in AUM, Marking a Milestone for Crypto Adoption Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in the United States have outpaced gold ETFs in net assets for the first time. According to data from K33 Research, the collective assets under management (AUM) of US Bitcoin ETFs crossed $129 billion on Dec. 16, surpassing the total held in gold ETFs, which was just shy of that figure. This milestone highlights a shift in institutional investor sentiment, with asset managers increasingly favoring Bitcoin over the traditional safe-haven asset. The data includes both spot Bitcoin ETFs and those tracking Bitcoin's performance through financial derivatives like futures. The rapid rise of Bitcoin ETFs reflects a growing recognition of Bitcoin as a legitimate investment vehicle. According to Vetle Lund, K33 Research’s head of research, this achievement sheds light on Bitcoin’s emerging role in the broader financial market. Bloomberg ETF analyst Eric Balchunas added that when factoring in all Bitcoin ETFs — including spot, futures, and leveraged funds — their collective AUM reaches $130 billion, compared to $128 billion for gold ETFs. However, he noted that spot Bitcoin ETFs alone account for $120 billion, trailing gold’s $125 billion. Balchunas described Bitcoin’s ability to compete with gold ETFs in such a short timeframe as ”unreal,” particularly given that spot Bitcoin ETFs only launched in January 2024 after a protracted approval process with the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). The introduction of spot Bitcoin ETFs has been a key driver behind Bitcoin’s dominance in the ETF landscape. These funds, which directly hold Bitcoin rather than derivatives, have attracted significant inflows since their debut, breaking the $100 billion AUM threshold in November. BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) has emerged as the frontrunner among Bitcoin ETFs, with nearly $60 billion in AUM. In November, IBIT overtook BlackRock’s own gold ETF, the iShares Gold Trust (IAU), marking a symbolic victory for the cryptocurrency over the precious metal. The surge in Bitcoin ETF assets also mirrors broader optimism about Bitcoin’s future. Bryan Armour, director of passive strategies research at Morningstar, noted that the 2024 US presidential election results, which saw Donald Trump secure a victory, played a pivotal role in boosting Bitcoin ETF performance. The post-election period brought over $5 billion in inflows, reflecting renewed confidence in Bitcoin as an asset class. The growing interest in Bitcoin ETFs aligns with what analysts call the “debasement trade.” This trend refers to investors seeking refuge in assets like gold and Bitcoin amid economic uncertainties and rising geopolitical tensions. A report from JPMorgan in October highlighted several factors driving this shift, including structurally higher geopolitical uncertainty since 2022, persistent inflation concerns, and worries about high government deficits across major economies. These factors have made both gold and Bitcoin attractive options for investors preparing for potential ”catastrophic scenarios.” On Dec. 16, Bitcoin’s purchasing power relative to gold reached a new all-time high as well, as BTC prices surged to record levels. A Paradigm Shift in Asset Allocation Bitcoin ETFs surpassing gold funds in AUM represents a significant turning point in the investment landscape. While gold has long been the go-to asset for preserving wealth during times of uncertainty, Bitcoin is rapidly emerging as a modern alternative. Its appeal lies in its potential for high returns, ease of transferability, and growing mainstream acceptance. The milestone also highlights the success of institutional players like BlackRock in legitimizing Bitcoin through regulated financial products. By offering investors a secure and accessible way to gain exposure to Bitcoin, these ETFs have played a crucial role in driving adoption. Despite its remarkable ascent, Bitcoin still faces challenges, including regulatory scrutiny, market volatility, and skepticism from traditional financial institutions. However, its performance in 2024 has demonstrated resilience and a growing ability to compete with established assets like gold. As Bitcoin ETFs continue to attract inflows, they could reshape the broader financial market by encouraging more institutional and retail investors to allocate capital to digital assets. This shift not only elevates Bitcoin’s status but also paves the way for broader cryptocurrency adoption in traditional finance.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|FIAT|MARKET|TRADING,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2024-12-18 05:30:00

Rollblock Presale Tops $7 Million,https://timestabloid.com/price-dip-or-buying-opportunity-savvy-traders-hoarding-meme/,"Price dip or buying opportunity? That’s the question many investors are asking following the crypto market’s post- bull run cooloff. Savvy traders are seizing the opportunity to take new positions. In fact, the SHIB meme coin had 15% in weekly gains while PEPE toppled Uniswap’s valuation. Meanwhile, the Rollblock presale has surged past $7 million , capturing attention with its unique “GambleFi” model and staking rewards. $7.3M and counting: Rollblock crypto casino set presale record ahead of the bull run The meme hype is gaining ground, and so is the innovation that Rollblock brings to the iGaming scene. Since its launch, Rollblock’s crypto presale has been gaining traction as one of the most talked-about opportunities in the altcoin market. Currently in stage nine presale , Rollblock has raised over $7.3M as a vote of confidence for its iGaming ingenuity. The reasons are crystal clear! The project stands out for its unique “GambleFi” model, which combines crypto gaming and staking features. Unlike traditional casinos and their pitfalls, Rollblock focuses on security and transparency by leveraging Ethereum’s smart contract. Its novel AI-powered betting tools designed to enhance user experience have also struck a chord with many punters. That’s why its ongoing presale is being compared to PEPE and SHIB ‘s meme success. The market is buzzing, and Rollblock is still selling at a discounted $0.0415. Shiba Inu shows signs of bullishness. A new bull run or a fakeout? Another altcoin that savvy traders have been hoarding ahead of the bull run is the beloved dog-themed Shiba Inu meme coin . Over the past week, Shiba Inu has shown bullish signs after breaking new levels with a 15% MoM gain to $0.00003. The meme coin ‘s outstanding performance and community-driven ecosystem development fueled the HODLing. Shiba Inu ‘s robust burn mechanism got a reface from the 1 CENT DREAM project to incinerate supply and aid price rise. Adding to the positive sentiment, Shiba Inu ‘s Shibarium L2 has reached a new milestone—$6M in TVL, 2M addresses, and over 60M transactions processed. Investors’ confidence is also on the rise, and some analysts are forecasting its rise to $80M in valuation. PEPE meme coin overtakes UNI as whales pour in billions PEPE faithful are also reaping the fruit of their foresight even before the bull run began. The frog-inspired meme coin broke the record—$11B market cap after overtaking UNI. This achievement represents an astounding 18x growth from its humble beginnings at $591 million earlier this year. This month’s performance is no different. PEPE has surged 150% on the heels of whales pouring in $1.14B. The token’s rally was further bolstered by its Dec. 5 listing on Binance.US and expanded accessibility through platforms like Robinhood and MoonPay. The milestones have exposed PEPE to newer investors, and analysts predict more upside during the bull run . Conclusion The crypto market’s full steam saw a cooldown, and savvy traders are already capitalizing on opportunities that signal massive future gains. Shiba Inu ‘s bullish breakout and PEPE ‘s record-smashing milestones show the enduring power of meme coins . Yet, Rollblock’s impressive $7.3M presale and innovative “GambleFi” model are turning heads as the next big contender. For investors, this dip isn’t just a cooldown—it’s the perfect time to position for explosive returns. Discover the exciting opportunities of the Rollblock (RBLK) presale today!

Another factor that boosted this rally was the inclusion of MicroStrategy in the Nasdaq 100 index . In an X post, Bloomberg’s Eric Balchunas, tagging James Seyffart on X, revealed that Bitcoin-Ethereum combo ETFs are likely to launch first, followed by Hedera (HBAR).

First out is likely the btc + eth combo ETFs, then prob Litecoin (bc its fork of btc = commodity), then HBAR (bc not labeled security) and then XRP/Solana (which have been labeled securities in pending… pic.twitter.com/29vMdciZxE — Eric Balchunas (@EricBalchunas) December 17, 2024 Optimism for new crypto ETFs has surged following President-elect Donald Trump’s nomination of Paul Atkins , a pro-crypto former SEC commissioner, and dethrone of SEC Chair, Gary Gensler is clearing the ETF path in the US. It is also evident that Atkins’ lighter regulatory approach could streamline the way for a broader range of crypto ETFs. Spotlight on Solana and XRP ETFs While proposals for Solana and XRP ETFs have been submitted, approval is unlikely until the new SEC leadership takes over in January. Bloomberg analysts suggest these funds could see the green light by late 2025. Nate Geraci, President of ETF Store, has also joined the conversation stating, “It’s highly likely Solana ETFs will be approved by the end of next year at the latest.” Bitcoin adoption and the rise of crypto ETFs are driving prices to new heights—Read Bitcoin price prediction to see where it’s headed next! Altcoins in Focus Other altcoin ETFs, including those for Litecoin (LTC) and Hedera (HBAR), could gain approval sooner due to their regulatory clarity. Seyffart highlighted that neither Litecoin nor HBAR has been classified as a security by the SEC, which simplifies their path to market. However, he questioned whether there’s sufficient investor demand for these products. Looking ahead, the number of altcoins ETF applications is expected to triple in the coming months, reflecting growing interest in diversifying crypto investment options. Issuers appear confident in the regulatory shift, with Two Prime Digital Assets CEO Alexander Blume remarking, “They wouldn’t waste the time and expense if they didn’t believe approval was likely.” .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : XRP is the Largest Token After BTC & ETH Despite Trading Below $3-Here’s What to Expect if the Price Marks an ATH , The market is opening doors for alternative investment options since Bitcoin is getting high the market needs fresh inflow.

However, every once in a while, a project comes along that catches the attention of industry veterans and sparks conversations about its potential to redefine the entire space. As we approach 2024, crypto experts are fixated on a new blockchain challenger that promises to address long-standing issues like scalability, sustainability, and integration with emerging technologies such as artificial intelligence (AI). Lightchain Protocol AI Presale Could this be the blockchain project that sets the new standard for the industry? Here’s why experts are so intrigued. The Challenges of Current Industry Leaders Blockchain giants like Ethereum, Solana, and Binance Smart Chain have made remarkable strides, but each comes with its own set of challenges: Ethereum: Its high gas fees and reliance on Layer 2 solutions to scale often frustrate users and developers. Solana: Known for its speed, Solana has faced network outages and questions about centralization. Binance Smart Chain: While efficient, it has been criticized for prioritizing performance over true decentralization. These pain points highlight the need for a blockchain that can combine high performance, decentralization, and innovative integration—all while being accessible and sustainable. The Features Turning Heads The blockchain gaining traction among experts is rumored to introduce groundbreaking features that directly address these gaps. Although details are still limited, here’s what we know so far: Lightchain Protocol AI Presale 1. A Revolutionary Consensus Mechanism The platform is said to use an entirely new consensus mechanism—possibly called Proof of Intelligence (PoI)—that leverages AI-driven computations to validate transactions. This could significantly improve energy efficiency and scalability while rewarding meaningful contributions to the network. 2. AI Integration at Its Core With an integrated Artificial Intelligence Virtual Machine (AIVM), this blockchain goes beyond mere decentralization. It enables developers to create dApps that utilize real-time AI for predictive analytics, automation, and advanced decision-making. 3. Seamless Scalability Unlike many existing blockchains, this project reportedly achieves scalability without sacrificing decentralization or security. By eliminating the need for complex Layer 2 solutions, it promises a more streamlined and user-friendly experience. 4. Environmentally Friendly Operations Sustainability has become a critical factor for blockchain adoption, and this challenger claims to have addressed this through its innovative consensus mechanism, which dramatically reduces energy consumption. Lightchain Protocol AI Presale Why Experts Are Taking Notice Crypto experts are excited about this project because it tackles the most pressing issues holding back widespread blockchain adoption. Its potential to deliver a solution that is not only scalable but also intelligent and sustainable could set it apart in a crowded market. What Experts Are Watching: Technical Feasibility: Can the platform truly deliver on its promises of efficiency and scalability? Developer Support: Will it attract the developer community needed to build a robust ecosystem of applications? Institutional Interest: Early partnerships with enterprises or governments could provide the momentum required for mass adoption. Implications For The Crypto Industry If this blockchain lives up to expectations, it could redefine industry standards and challenge the dominance of established players like Ethereum and Solana. Beyond the crypto market, its AI integration could open the door to new applications in industries such as healthcare, finance, logistics, and gaming. Key Use Cases: Decentralized Finance (DeFi): Smarter, faster, and more secure financial services. Supply Chain Optimization: Transparent and intelligent tracking of goods and resources. AI-Powered Governance: Decentralized decision-making enhanced by real-time data analysis. Is This the Future of Blockchain? While it’s too early to say for certain, the buzz surrounding this blockchain challenger is hard to ignore. Its ability to address long-standing issues while introducing innovative features could make it the platform to watch in 2024. For investors and developers, the opportunity to get involved in a project with this level of potential is rare—and could prove transformative. Challenger Worth Watching The crypto world thrives on disruption, and this new blockchain challenger is poised to deliver just that. By combining cutting-edge technology with practical solutions to the industry’s biggest problems, it has the potential to meet and exceed the expectations of both the crypto community and the broader tech world. As details continue to emerge, this project is shaping up to be one of the most exciting developments of 2024.

Although labor markets show signs of moderation, inflation remains sticky with CPI surging to 2.8% in November from 2.4% in September. While the markets have already priced at the 25 basis points rate cut, analysts are curious about the US Fed Chair Powell’s comments on the 2025 monetary policy. Amid stick inflation, the US Federal Reserve might reduce 2025 rate cuts to three from the previously projected four rate cuts. This shows that the US central bank will once again turn hawkish in order to bring inflation under its desired 2% target. Kurt S Altrichter , the founder of Ivory Hill Wealth noted: “Tomorrow’s Fed meeting isn’t just about the expected rate cut — it’s about how committed the Fed remains to rate cuts in 2025. More cuts = better for stocks and bonds. Fewer cuts = markets adjust expectations”. On-Chain Data Signals Sell-Off Amid this uncertainty, short-term holders have opted for heavy profit booking during the recent meeting. On-chain analytics platform Santiment reported that BTC holders holding the asset for 90 to 365 days have been capitalizing on profits above $100K levels. In contrast, longer-term holders , who were active in the $90,000–$100,000 price range, have shown significantly less activity once the price surpassed $100,000. Source: Santiment Bitcoin Price Retracement Likely This Week If history repeats, the Bitcoin price is likely to see some retracement this week. As BTC has entered week 7 of its price discovery, popular crypto analyst Rekt Capital expects a pullback ahead. Highlighting data from previous cycles, the analyst notes that: In 2013, Bitcoin experienced a pullback during Week 7 of price discovery. In 2017, the cryptocurrency retraced by 34% in Week 8. In 2021, Bitcoin saw a 16% decline in Week 6. Thus, if BTC repeats history, we can expect a similar pullback which can take the Bitcoin price under $100K as well. Rekt Capital warns that such corrections are a normal part of Bitcoin’s cycle and have historically erased weeks of gains in a short time. BitMEX co-founder Arthur Hayes predicts market correction, forecasting a significant downturn around January 20 — Donald Trump’s presidential inauguration day. Hayes added that his Maelstrom investment fund plans to lighten up certain positions ahead of the anticipated market turbulence. Traders are going with liquidation, investors may not sell their holdings as top analysts including Peter Brandt predicted Bitcoin price to hit $125K. As of press time, BTC price is trading 2.5% down at $103,820, with its daily trading volume dropping 10%. The Coinglass liquidation data also shows $71 million in BTC liquidation in the last 24 hours. with $48 million in long liquidations.

Bitfinex’s latest reports suggest when BTC’s peak could come and how much climbing might be left for the flagship crypto. Related Reading: Bitcoin To Hit $180,000 If These Cycle Top Indicators Are Absent, Says VanEck’s Sigel Bitcoin’s ‘Unique’ Cycle In its latest Alpha Report, Bitfinex highlighted the crypto industry’s big strides in adoption and mainstream recognition this year, which have differentiated this cycle from previous ones. Notably, the launch and increasing institutional demand of Bitcoin and Ethereum spot exchange-traded funds (ETFs) have surpassed expectations and attracted a “new class of investors” to the crypto space. Per the report, this cycle has been “unique” as these new investors brought by ETFs and increasing confidence in the sector sent BTC’s price to a new ATH ahead of the Halving event, historically leading the flagship crypto to a new high after 5-7 months. The industry also saw a growing interest in diversifying national reserves with cryptocurrencies, with several jurisdictions worldwide considering implementing a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve after the flagship crypto’s recent performance. According to Bitfinex analysts, these factors have kept BTC’s corrections smaller than other cycles and will likely continue this trend for the rest of the bull run: In the current bull cycle, which began in mid to late 2023, Bitcoinʼs corrections have been smaller, particularly since the launch of Bitcoin ETFs in early 2024. With institutional and ETF demand providing consistent buying pressure, we expect this trend to continue, keeping future corrections limited and potentially shorter in duration. Moreover, the upcoming crypto-friendly US administration added to the growing bullish sentiment surrounding the industry, leading to the massive post-election rally. As a result, the crypto market has grown 130% year-to-date (YTD) to a market capitalization of $3.69 trillion, increasing nearly 70% this quarter. What’s Next For Bitcoin This Cycle? The report noted Bitcoin’s performance, highlighting its 573% surge from its 2022 low of $15,487. The flagship crypto has also seen an increase of 130% year-to-date (YTD), fueled by this year’s industry achievements. Earlier this month, Bitcoin broke past the $100,000 barrier for the first time, setting a new ATH closer to the $110,000 level on Monday. According to Bitfinex, the cryptocurrency still has several levels to climb in 2025, as historical data indicates that the market is mid-cycle. This data suggests BTC’s price will likely peak around Q3 and Q4 2025, as it tends to do approximately 450 days post-halving. Meanwhile, metrics like Market Value to Realized Value (MVRV), Net Unrealized Profit and Loss (NUPL), and the Bull-Bear market indicator signal that “we remain in the bull phase but far from euphoric peaks.” Bitfinex also explained that the Pi Cycle Top Indicator has historically been effective in timing cycle highs, forecasting the peaks with a three-day window. The previous cycle’s predictions indicate that Bitcoin could peak between mid-2025 and early-2026.

Nonetheless, the report notes that the flagship crypto has been on a trend of diminishing returns over the cycles. Based on this, Bitcoin’s price might see a 15% to 20% increase to the $160,000-$200,000 range instead. However, if the cryptocurrency mirrors 2017’s cycle pattern, BTC’s rally could extend until January of 2026, peaking at $229,000 with similar diminishing returns. As of this writing, BTC is trading at $107,729, just 0.3% below its ATH.

It piggybacks on this to amass a community of hungry traders and equips them with market-beating tools. These include trading signals, meme coin picks, a trading insiders group, staking, and trading rewards. The project raised a staggering $27 million in its first week of presale, which took Pepe Unchained five months to achieve. As such, the Wall Street Pepe ICO looks set to sell out in days or weeks.

Visit Flockerz Presale Solaxy Pepe Unchained raised over $70 million in its ICO for the first Pepe-themed Ethereum layer 2 blockchain. This shows a massive demand for layer 2 technology. With that in mind, Solaxy could be one of the strongest ICOs on the market right now. It’s the first Solana layer 2 blockchain, making Solana even more scalable than it already is. https://twitter.com/SOLAXYTOKEN/status/1867318005660889427 Due to Solana’s sheer popularity, it suffers from congestion issues despite being capable of 6,500 transactions per second (TPS). This leads to longer wait times, higher fees, and sometimes transaction failures. Solaxy fixes this by batching transactions and computing them off the main network before reporting them back to Solana for finality. This enhances Solana’s transactional capabilities, making transactions cheaper, faster, and smoother. Solaxy launched its ICO four days ago and has raised $630K so far. The current price is $0.001558, but this will rise later today.

Citing Bitcoin’s potential to strengthen the US dollar and enhance national economic security, the document outlines a framework for establishing it as a strategic reserve asset within the US Treasury’s Exchange Stabilization Fund (ESF). The draft, titled “Executive Order Designating Bitcoin as a Strategic Reserve Asset within the Exchange Stabilization Fund,” states that it is important for the United States to adapt to global financial innovations in order to maintain its economic leadership. It describes Bitcoin as a “decentralized and limited store of value asset” comparable to digital gold. The proposal addresses three key objectives: Establishment of the Strategic Bitcoin Reserve (SBR): The SBR will promote economic flexibility by increasing the diversity of U.S. reserve assets. Bitcoin Designation as a Strategic Asset: The bill positions Bitcoin as a key component of U.S. financial dominance, allowing for its inclusion in the ESF. Leadership in the Digital Assets Industry: The plan aims to attract capital, talent, and businesses in the digital assets industry to the United States. Related News: Tragicomic Event on This Altcoin: An Investor Turns $10,000 into $3 in Seconds The draft outlines specific actions to achieve these goals: Creation of the Strategic Bitcoin Reserve: Led by the Secretary of the Treasury, the SBR will operate under strict security, regular audits, and comprehensive reporting to ensure transparency and long-term accountability. Consolidation of Government Bitcoin Assets: Within seven days of the Executive Order going into effect, all Bitcoin held by federal agencies, including those seized in legal proceedings, will be transferred to the SBR. Purchase Program for Bitcoin: The Treasury will implement a Bitcoin purchase program within 60 days that aims to position the U.S. as a global leader in digital assets. *This is not investment advice.

Trump’s promise to fire SEC Chair Gary Gensler on day one seems to be coming true, as Gensler announced his resignation on January 20, the same day Trump is inaugurated. This big news helped push XRP to new yearly highs. Plus, Ripple’s RLUSD launched on December 17, taking a big step toward global growth. Meanwhile, SEC Commissioner Caroline Crenshaw became a target of the crypto community due to her strong anti-crypto stance and was denied renomination. All of these events could lead to something big on January 15, especially with Paul Atkins soon taking over as SEC Chair. Many are hopeful that this will bring a more relaxed approach to crypto regulation. What Will Happen on January 15? The SEC has requested an extension to file its principal brief in the ongoing XRP lawsuit with Ripple Labs. The new deadline for filing is set for January 15, 2025. According to attorney Fred Rispoli, this part of the case is strictly about paperwork — no new evidence or jury trial. There are two appeals in process: one from the SEC and another from Ripple, called a “cross-appeal.” Each side will submit an opening brief, followed by an opposition brief, and then a reply brief. Afterward, there will be a 15-minute oral argument in front of three judges . Fred said that while the argument is brief, it will be crucial, as the judges’ questions can provide insight into their initial thoughts on the case. However, he also said that the entire process could take up to a year and a half, despite the short duration of the oral argument. Even if the legal case continues, supporters remain optimistic that the new government will implement the right measures to support the crypto industry. Another bullish development is that Empower Oversight is urging Congress to release an SEC Inspector General report on former chairman Jay Clayton’s actions.

In this many US states are diving into Trump’s Bitcoin Reserve strategy. Ohio lawmaker Derek Merrin has proposed a groundbreaking bill called the Ohio Bitcoin Reserve Act (HB 703). This legislation, introduced on December 17, 2024, would allow the state treasurer to invest in Bitcoin as part of Ohio’s financial reserves. Today, I filed HB 703 to create the Ohio Bitcoin Reserve within the state treasury! Provides state treasurer authority & flexibility to invest in #Bitcoin This legislation creates the framework for Ohio’s state government to harness the power of Bitcoin to strengthen our… pic.twitter.com/hSWas2qeQd — Derek Merrin (@DerekMerrin) December 17, 2024 While not mandatory, the bill gives the treasurer the flexibility to include Bitcoin in the state’s asset portfolio. Merrin believes this move is essential to safeguard taxpayer funds from losing value due to the devaluation of the U.S. dollar. Bitcoin as a Hedge Against Economic Uncertainty Merrin’s proposal positions Bitcoin as a modern solution and is also required in times when the dollar declines and economic problems erupt. He described Bitcoin as “digital property rights for everyone,” basically to strengthen Ohio’s financial system. By adopting Bitcoin, the state could hedge against inflation and economic uncertainty, ensuring taxpayer money retains its value over time. Finally, this is also an option for states to show how these risky assets can be used to secure the state’s financial health with lower interest rates. Even though the bill was introduced just weeks before the current legislative session ends on December 31, Merrin intends to bring it back in January 2025 during the next session. He hopes this proposal will give Ohio lawmakers a clear plan to quickly adopt Bitcoin as part of the state’s financial strategy. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Bitcoin Hits $106K as Trump’s Reserve Plan Sparks Crypto Frenzy , Joining a Growing Trend Among States Ohio isn’t the only state looking into Bitcoin for its savings. Texas has come up with the “ Texas Strategic Bitcoin Reserve Act ,” which plans to keep Bitcoin as a long-term asset for at least five years. Meanwhile, Pennsylvania wants to invest up to 10% of its treasury in Bitcoin, believing it could help manage its finances in economic challenges. Bitcoin adoption and the rise of crypto ETFs are driving prices to new heights—Read Bitcoin price prediction to see where it’s headed next! Merrin’s Crypto Advocacy Looking at the current scenario Merrin holds a top “A” rating from Coinbase’s Stand With Crypto initiative and has called for a modern framework to protect individuals’ rights to own and trade digital assets. Merrin believes that adopting Bitcoin is not just a financial strategy but a step toward embracing the future of money. If Ohio’s Bitcoin Reserve Act becomes law, it will not only make it a market leader but will also protect Taxpayers from uncertain risks. Bitcoin reserve plan is gaining momentum in the US and many expect that it will be a reality sooner or later. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

This triggered a massive bullish wave across the markets, with more altcoins gaining strength and printing huge bullish candles. Meanwhile, the other cryptos within the top 10, like ETH, DOGE, ADA, or SOL, remained restricted within the range, rising slightly above their respective resistance levels. However, the start of the day’s trade turned out to be bearish, wiping out over $150 million of the market capitalisation with a slight drop in the trading volume of over 3%. Pudgy Penguins (PENGU): The Next Memecoin Sensation in the Markets Now that the bulls are displaying weakness, the tokens have dropped heavily, but some altcoins have managed to maintain an ascending trend. PENGU, the new token in the Pudgy Penguins ecosystems, launched on Solana with a splash, reaching the top 100. However, the excitement around the token turned into chaos as the price plunged over 57% from the highs of around $0.068, mainly driven by a sell-off of 20% of its supply. Pudgy Penguins has just gone live on BitgetGlobal with a huge airdrop distribution, considered the largest of all. Similar to the other airdrops, the PENGU also faced a huge sell-off soon after the launch of the spot trading. Besides, it has also entered the top 10 memecoins but the 50% pullback has raised major concerns. Therefore, it is required to be vigilant about this token before jumping into any trade. Bitget Token (BGB): Breaking New Highs The Bitget token price has been marking new highs every new day with a massive rise in the trading volume. The token marked a rise of over 16% and entered the top gainer’s list as the broader markets remain stuck under the bearish influence. The BGB price has broken above the rising parallel channel and has been trading within the discovery phase for the past week. In the times when a retracement was expected, the token rebounded and marched towards new highs. The RSI has reached its highest-ever level at 93.61 and is showing no signs of a bearish divergence. Hence the token is believed to maintain a healthy upswing and reach $5 before facing a retracement.",Price Analysis|Altcoins|Bitcoin,EN,0,0,BTC|ETH|MARKET|TRADING|BGB,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2024-12-18 06:23:42

Kris Marszalek, Crypto.com CEO, met Donald Trump at Mar-a-Lago on Dec. 16 to talk about the proposed crypto-related appointments within the financial departments and Congress. They also discussed drafts of a U.S. Strategic Bitcoin Reserve to be administered within the Treasury’s Exchange Stabilization Fund, as noted in his Nashville speech delivered in July.

The order is an effort to cement the United States’ leadership in digital assets, which will build economic resilience and global financial supremacy. The meeting with the 45-year-old CEO follows a recent phone call between Trump and Brian Armstrong, the CEO of Coinbase, which took place on Nov.19, as reported by Fortune. In addition to consulting with CEOs of crypto firms, Trump has enlisted several known crypto proponents, including Howard Lutnick as commerce secretary and Paul Atkins to lead the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission in his coming term, which has further cemented his pro-crypto stance. BTC also hit an all-time high of $108,268.45 on Dec. 17, likely fueled by the news of Trump meeting Marszalek. At the same time, Derek Merrin, who leads the Ohio House Republicans, has also proposed a bill to introduce a state-backed Bitcoin Reserve.

Meanwhile, Ohio also proposed a Bitcoin reserve bill after similar initiatives in Texas and Pennsylvania. President Biden backed a congressional stock trading ban after scrutiny over lawmakers’ crypto holdings, while SEC Commissioner Caroline Crenshaw’s renomination faces uncertainty due to crypto-related controversies and political shifts. Crypto.com CEO Meets Donald Trump United States President-elect Donald Trump recently met with Crypto.com CEO Kris Marszalek at his residence in Mar-a-Lago to discuss policies that could impact the cryptocurrency industry. According to a Dec. 16 social media post , Marszalek traveled to Florida for the meeting, during which they reportedly explored Trump’s proposal to establish a national Bitcoin reserve and discussed potential appointments to his administration that could shape the future of the crypto sector. The meeting coincided with Crypto.com’s decision to drop its lawsuit against the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). On the same day, the exchange voluntarily dismissed its case against the SEC and its commissioners with prejudice, according to a filing that was submitted to the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Texas. Marszalek previously announced in October that the exchange planned to file the lawsuit to counter a Wells notice received from the SEC. However, a Crypto.com spokesperson revealed that the case was withdrawn to align with the firm’s intent to collaborate with the incoming administration on regulatory frameworks for the industry. Since his election victory on Nov. 5, Trump very clearly indicated support for the crypto industry through his proposed appointments. The president-elect named several people with pro-crypto perspectives to key roles, including former PayPal COO David Sacks as the “AI and crypto czar” and former SEC commissioner Paul Atkins as his pick for SEC chair. In addition to Marszalek, Trump also met with Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong in November to discuss potential personnel appointments. These meetings happened after Trump launched his own digital asset initiative, World Liberty Financial, during his campaign. Ohio Proposes Bitcoin Reserve Fund Donald Trump is not the only person eyeing a Bitcoin stockpile. An Ohio lawmaker recently introduced legislation to establish a Bitcoin fund in the state treasury, making it the third U.S. state to pursue a Bitcoin reserve in just over a month. Ohio House Republicans leader Derek Merrin proposed HB 703, the Ohio Bitcoin Reserve Act, on Dec. 17. The bill will grant the state treasurer the authority to buy Bitcoin as part of a broader asset allocation strategy, though it does not mandate these purchases. Merrin described the initiative as a response to the devaluation of the U.S. dollar, and believes there is a need for Ohio to embrace emerging technology and safeguard tax dollars from losing value. He added that the legislation sets the stage for Ohio to take advantage of Bitcoin to strengthen its finances. He even compared the cryptocurrency to ”digital property rights” and called it revolutionary for global economies. The current legislative session is set to adjourn on Dec. 31, which means that the bill is unlikely to advance before then. Merrin stated that he expects the proposal to serve as a foundation for Ohio’s next legislative session, which begins Jan. 6 of 2025, when it will need to be reintroduced. Merrin is a vocal supporter of crypto, and holds a top-tier “A” rating from Coinbase’s Stand With Crypto lobbying arm. He also consistently advocated for policies protecting individuals' rights to own and transact with digital assets. Ohio’s efforts are similar to initiatives in Texas and Pennsylvania after Donald Trump’s presidential election victory in November. His win brought renewed attention to Bitcoin's potential role as a state or federal reserve asset. Texas Representative Giovanni Capriglione introduced the Texas Strategic Bitcoin Reserve Act on Dec. 12, proposing a five-year holding period for Bitcoin as a state reserve. In Pennsylvania, Representative Mike Cabell proposed legislation in November to permit the state treasury to allocate up to 10% of its holdings to Bitcoin. Biden Backs Congressional Stock Trading Ban President Joe Biden recently expressed his support for banning members of Congress from trading stocks while in office by stating that “nobody in the Congress should be able to make money in the stock market while they’re in the Congress.” In an interview to be released by the labor advocacy group More Perfect Union, Biden shared his thoughts amid calls to prevent potential conflicts of interest among lawmakers. Although President Biden previously avoided commenting on legislation restricting stock trading for government officials, past proposals gained some renewed traction in Congress. In July, lawmakers from both the House and Senate supported measures to prevent the president, vice president, and members of Congress from trading or selling various financial assets, including stocks, commodities, and cryptocurrencies. This extends to assets disclosed under the STOCK Act, which was introduced in 2012 to enhance transparency. Biden mentioned his own practice of relying solely on his Senate salary during his decades-long tenure representing Delaware from 1973 to 2009. While the president largely stayed silent on cryptocurrencies, he did sign an executive order in 2022 to create a regulatory framework for digital assets. Concerns over potential conflicts of interest have intensified following the election of President-elect Donald Trump, who holds large amounts of crypto, including tens of millions of dollars in personal wallets and through his decentralized finance project, World Liberty Financial. As a result of this, critics questioned whether Trump’s financial interests and those of his supporters in the crypto industry could influence his policy decisions. Several members of Congress, including Georgia Representative Mike Collins , Texas Senator Ted Cruz, and Wyoming Senator Cynthia Lummis, have disclosed their own cryptocurrency holdings, which only added to the scrutiny. Lummis is a strong Bitcoin advocate, and also proposed creating a strategic Bitcoin reserve for the United States, a move experts say could drive up the cryptocurrency’s price. It is still unclear whether President Biden would support extending a stock trading ban to include Supreme Court justices. While the justices are allowed to trade stocks, they risk potential conflicts of interest if they do not withdraw themselves from cases involving their financial holdings. Crenshaw’s SEC Nomination in Doubt Meanwhile, United States lawmakers on the Senate Banking Committee canceled a planned session to consider the renomination of Caroline Crenshaw for a second term as a commissioner at the SEC. According to a Dec. 17 announcement, the committee will no longer meet on Dec. 18 to vote on Crenshaw’s nomination or that of Gordon Ito to the Financial Stability Oversight Council. This reduces the likelihood of Crenshaw’s confirmation before Republicans gain majority control of the Senate in January. Cancelation of session to consider nominations (Source: US Senate Banking Committee ) Crenshaw has served as an SEC commissioner under both incoming President Donald Trump and current President Joe Biden, and her term ended in June this year. She is allowed to continue in her role for up to 18 months beyond her term’s expiration. So far, her nomination faced some pushback from crypto interest groups, which labeled her “more anti-crypto” than SEC Chair Gary Gensler. On the other hand, more than 40 organizations urged senators to support her, arguing that a Trump-led administration is unlikely to appoint any Democratic SEC commissioners. The SEC’s approach to cryptocurrency regulation and its political composition have been key issues for Trump, who campaigned on promises to overhaul the agency. Trump even vowed to fire Gensler immediately after taking office and suggested that his administration will adopt a more crypto-friendly stance. Crenshaw’s nomination, if reconsidered by the Republican-led Senate, is still uncertain. If confirmed, she could serve at the SEC until 2029.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|FIAT|REGULATION|TRADING,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2024-12-18 06:30:35

The announcement revived hope among Solana investors who have been waiting on the sidelines for the past few weeks as SOL consolidated around $210. Solana Price Rally to All-Time High of $300 Soon? After hitting the high of $263 on November 22, the Solana price has been moving sideways over the past few weeks and is showing signs of recovery after hitting a low of $203 last week. Despite the Bitcoin price drop and broader market correction, SOL bulls are relatively showing greater strength today. Challenging the widespread bearish sentiment, popular crypto analyst Crypto Jelle has offered a contrarian take on Solana (SOL). “Many have written off SOL, but the charts tell a different story,” Crypto Jelle noted. He pointed out that the asset is forming a falling wedge—a bullish technical pattern—near a key resistance level that recently flipped into support. The analyst remains optimistic, forecasting a potential Solana price rally to new all-time highs before the end of the year despite prevailing doubts. Source: Crypto Jelle As the Solana price eyes its next surge to $300, it needs to clear past the resistances of $244 and $265 in the midway. However, with the cup-and-handle breakout, the SOL price rally can extend further to $400. As of press time, the SOL price is trading at $217 with open interest surging 2.25% to $5.34 billion as per the Coinglass data . Bitwise Solana Staking ETP Goes Live Bitwise, the popular crypto asset manager launched a Solana Staking ETP (BSOL) on Monday in partnership with Marinade as its staking provider. The development comes within a month of Bitwise filing for a spot Solana ETF in the US. However, market analysts say that Solana ETF approval in the US might take time, and other altcoins like Hedera (HBAR), and Litecoin (LTC) may get the first pass. Bitwise already holds a presence in the European Solana ETP market with its ESOL product having $24 million in assets under management. However, ESOL has faced investor criticism due to its lack of staking rewards, a feature that has been increasingly profitable for Solana investors. The newly introduced Bitwise Solana ETP (BSOL) addresses this issue by incorporating staking rewards. While Solana ETP issuers don’t provide the full staking reward rate, Bitwise’s BSOL will pay 6.48%. his is slightly higher than the 5.49% offered by 21Shares’ Solana staking ETP, the fifth-largest crypto ETP in Europe. Additionally, BSOL comes with a competitive annual management fee of 0.85%, compared to 21Shares’ 2.5%.

Trump Patriot (TRUMPPAT), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 19,000% in price in the coming days. This is because TRUMPPAT is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Trump Patriot can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Trump Patriot could become the next viral memecoin. Trump Patriot launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Trump Patriot on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Trump Patriot by entering its contract address – 9hmvtogFEjzZQMFfJ5Hiq7fQSq7E38mG3Qjb7X42qM6P – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like TRUMPPAT. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Press Releases,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|DOGE|EXCHANGE|SHIB|SOL,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2024-12-18 06:45:00

It’s building the first meme coin staking platform, which will allow users to generate passive rewards on all the top meme coin assets. The presale will end in three days, and then $STARS will list on exchanges. As the end date nears, traders are making more significant investments in the presale. Currently, the total raise sits at $19.4 million. Favorable market conditions spurred by Bitcoin crossing $100K, alongside investors witnessing the success of Pepe Unchained after its ICO, are helping drive Crypto All-Stars’ presale momentum. $STARS Creates A New Meme Coin Economy The meme coin market is worth $117 billion today, and all the top projects have experienced significant price increases in recent months. However, compared to other asset classes, such as DeFi and AI, investors can do very little with their meme coins beyond buy and sell. Crypto All-Stars is changing this by creating a staking platform that allows users to generate passive income from their tokens. Holders across the meme coin industry will be highly interested in this. The Crypto All-Stars staking platform supports 11 of the top meme coins. These are: Dogecoin, Shiba Inu, Pepe, Bonk, Brett, Mog Coin, Floki, Milady, Turbo, Toshi, and Coq Inu. With the launch approaching so soon the All-Stars are getting their dance on! Does anyone else want a $STARS chandelier? pic.twitter.com/1JMT3tVLt6 — Crypto All-Stars (@all_stars_coin) December 10, 2024 The team also noted that they’ll add more meme coins later. To access the platform, users must hold $STARS, and the amount they hold determines how much they can earn. This creates a flywheel effect: All users must buy $STARS, and they’re incentivized to hold as much as possible. Therefore, it’s likely that we’ll see users hoard staking rewards rather than sell them. As the team adds new projects to the staking platform, this could significantly impact the Crypto All-Stars price. There won’t be enough supply for new users to buy, causing the price to rocket. Indeed, this means that those who buy during the presale could be at a significant advantage, as they are among the only investors to buy before the staking platform and accompanying utility-driven demand begins. Traders seek Pepe Unchained Alternative After 500% gain – is it $STARS? Utility-focused meme coin Pepe Unchained soared 500% within three days after its presale ended last week, underlining the explosive potential of popular presale tokens once they hit the open market. Pepe Unchained’s success has driven significant demand for Crypto All-Stars, with investors hoping for a rerun of its gains once $STARS lists on exchanges. As to how far it could go, analyst ClayBro is looking beyond the 500% gain that Pepe Unchained provided and suggests it could 10x in price. ClayBro underscores that the market appeal for meme coins is picking up, and Crypto All-Stars is well-positioned as an innovative application inside the sector. Other analysts are looking even further ahead. For instance, Crypto June says it can 100x. Something to note is that Pepe Unchained launched with a much higher market cap than Crypto All-Stars. This leaves more room for growth for $STARS, which is partly why analysts believe gains between 10x and 100x are possible. Secure Crypto All-stars For $0.0016782 Before It’s Too Late The Crypto All-Stars presale is available to buy at a fixed price of $0.0016782. But with three days until it ends, now is the time to act for those who haven’t done so already. Investors can buy $STARS via the project’s website or using the Best Wallet app. Crypto All-Stars has been audited by Coinsult and Solid Proof , with both firms finding the project to be safe and secure.

According to Eleanor Terett in Fox Business, the Senate Banking Committee canceled the vote on her renomination, effectively ending her tenure. Eleanor Terrett @EleanorTerrett · Follow 🚨BREAKING: A Senate aide has just informed me that tomorrow’s Senate Banking Committee scheduled markup vote on @SECGov Commissioner Caroline Crenshaw has been canceled. She will not be renominated to her position. 3:28 am · 18 Dec 2024 2.3K Reply Copy link Read 207 replies Known for her staunch anti-crypto stance, Crenshaw opposed the approval of the Bitcoin spot ETF and other pivotal policies. Her departure is expected to pave the way for a more pro-crypto regulatory environment under new leadership. Crenshaw, who joined the SEC in 2020, was initially appointed under the Trump administration and later renominated by President Biden. During her tenure, she was a close ally of SEC Chair Gary Gensler and was often considered even more aggressive in her approach to cryptocurrency regulation. Her exit marks a significant shift in the regulatory landscape, potentially altering the SEC’s focus on enforcement actions within the crypto sector. Industry pressures shaped the outcome The crypto community played a vital role in this outcome. Advocacy groups and individuals flooded the Senate with over 107,000 emails opposing Crenshaw’s renomination, a show of force highlighting the industry’s growing influence. This unprecedented mobilization demonstrates the sector’s readiness to fight against restrictive policies and push for fairer regulations. This sentiment is echoed by pro-crypto lawmakers like Senator Cynthia Lummis, who has predicted a transformative year for Bitcoin and digital assets in 2025. With Crenshaw no longer at the helm, there is anticipation of changes in the SEC’s approach, particularly around Bitcoin ETFs and other crypto assets. Crenshaw’s departure raises questions about the SEC’s ongoing legal battles, notably with Ripple Labs. Her strict enforcement stance against Ripple and other crypto projects was seen as a hallmark of her tenure. Without her influence, there is growing optimism that the SEC may reconsider its legal strategy, especially as pressure mounts for clearer regulatory guidelines. Interestingly, the crypto markets showed little immediate reaction to the news. Legal experts suggest this is due to the nuanced nature of the development, which may take time to resonate with broader market participants. However, the long-term implications could be profound, particularly for projects like Ripple that have faced significant challenges under the current regulatory framework. SEC’s future direction hinges on who replaces Crenshaw Speculation suggests that a Trump-appointed successor could adopt a more balanced approach toward crypto. This aligns with broader industry hopes for regulatory clarity and support for innovation. Meanwhile, the crypto industry is closely watching developments around the Bitcoin spot ETF. Crenshaw’s opposition was a key factor in delaying its approval, but her absence could accelerate the decision-making process. As the SEC’s leadership undergoes a shake-up, the potential for a more crypto-friendly regulatory environment is on the rise. The departure of a staunch opponent like Crenshaw opens the door for dialogue and progress, aligning with the crypto industry’s aspirations for growth and legitimacy.

The executive order is designed to take effect immediately upon being signed by Donald Trump on his first day in office.

The draft suggests that recognizing BTC as a strategic asset could enhance the country’s financial stability and security.

The order also acknowledged BTC as a decentralized and finite store-of-value asset, akin to digital gold. The institute believes that BTC’s unique attributes can bolster the resilience of the U.S. dollar and support American economic interests. The order maintained that BTC is a suitable asset for strategic acquisition within the Treasury Department’s Exchange Stabilization Fund (ESF). It also confirmed that Bitcoin establishes itself as a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve and could be a permanent national asset for the benefit of all Americans. The executive order suggested that it’s important to establish a Strategic BTC Reserve in order to grow the U.S. economy and to cement American financial dominance in the future. It also suggested that it’s important to expand the diversity of assets being held within the ESF to safeguard national economic activity and competitive advantage in the 21st Century. The presidential directive also highlighted the goal of the U.S. is to become the global leader of the digital assets industry. The order maintained that the U.S. can attain this by attracting capital, talent, and sound businesses to set up and expand in the U.S. The order seeks to diversify U.S reserve assets “This is meant to be a good thing for the United States and is not a giveaway to the Bitcoin or crypto industry. ” ~ Zack Shapiro, Head of Policy at Bitcoin Policy Institute. The executive order revealed it has established the Strategic BTC Reserve (SBR) with the goal of enhancing the diversity of U.S. reserve assets. It also argued that the SBR will be subject to regular audits, stringent security standards, and comprehensive reporting measures to ensure accountability and security over the long term. The order also wants to consolidate government bitcoin holdings within 7 days of the date of the order. It suggested that any Bitcoin under the control of any Federal agency, including the United State Marshal Service, shall not be sold, swapped, auctioned, or encumbered. The order recommended that upon the acquisition of a legal title, BTC should be transferred by the head of such Federal agency to the SBR. The executive order also proposed that Bitcoin be designated as a strategic reserve asset suitable for purchase and holding within the ESF. It also directed the Secretary of the Treasury to implement an acquisition program for Bitcoin to acquire and manage BTC within the ESF within 60 days of the date of the order. Zack Shapiro, Head of Policy at Bitcoin Policy Institute, denied claims by Stephanie Ruhle, host at MSNBC, that the order might be the biggest bailout to crypto ever. Shapiro highlighted that the people responsible for the bill, including Cynthia Lummis, are not planning to sell their bitcoin to the government as part of the bill. He also believes that the order is not meant to pay bonuses to wealthy crypto executives just because Bitcoin’s price might go up.

As established Web3 names like Chainlink and Solana experience stagnant growth, the spotlight turns to newer, promising projects poised for substantial returns. Stacks is gaining traction with its recent Nakamoto upgrade, enhancing transaction speed and introducing Bitcoin-backed sBTC that bridges smart contracts with Bitcoin’s liquidity. Similarly, Web3Bay is carving a niche in decentralized e-commerce, establishing a user-driven marketplace powered by its 3BAY token. Early investment in Web3Bay’s presale could yield unique benefits and strong community ties in a project with significant growth prospects. Stacks: Leveraging Bitcoin for Enhanced Web3 Functionality Stacks is transforming Bitcoin’s utility by integrating smart contracts and decentralized apps into its robust network. The Nakamoto upgrade marks a significant advancement by separating Stacks’ transactions from Bitcoin’s, enhancing efficiency. It introduces sBTC, a Bitcoin-backed asset that facilitates smart contract interactions with Bitcoin, potentially attracting new applications and DeFi projects to tap into Bitcoin’s vast market cap. As Stacks becomes increasingly adaptable, its market value has responded positively. Currently trading around $2.40 as of December 2024, Stacks is drawing developer interest and witnessing a surge in smart contract activity, setting it up as a leading Web3 crypto that could mainstream Web3 functionalities on Bitcoin’s platform. Web3Bay: A New Era of E-Commerce on the Blockchain While Stacks enhances Bitcoin usability, Web3Bay aims to revolutionize e-commerce through decentralization. This platform allows users to interact with digital assets transparently and securely, challenging centralized platforms that monopolize user data. Web3Bay’s 3BAY token facilitates transactions and offers perks like discounts on purchases and a role in governance, embodying a community-centric approach. Web3Bay also supports traditional payment methods like PayPal, marrying Web2 convenience with Web3’s innovative features, positioning it as an attractive Web3 crypto for those interested in decentralized marketplaces. The Benefits of Early Investment in Web3Bay’s Presale Participating in Web3Bay’s presale provides early investors with several advantages. The presale, spanning 28 stages with a 15% price increase per stage, rewards early engagement with lower prices and potential high returns. Early participants gain influence within the platform’s governance, directly impacting its evolution. Investing early helps stabilize Web3Bay’s foundation for a smoother launch, with plans for cross-chain compatibility to facilitate transactions across major blockchain networks. This strategic vision, combined with early investment benefits, makes Web3Bay a promising venture for potential growth. In Conclusion Both Stacks and Web3Bay are paving distinct paths in the Web3 sector, each offering unique innovations—Stacks with its Bitcoin-focused enhancements and Web3Bay with its user-centric e-commerce platform. For early backers, these projects not only offer a chance at lucrative returns but also an opportunity to be part of progressive Web3 developments. Whether you’re drawn to Stacks’ security enhancements or Web3Bay’s e-commerce revolution, both cryptos offer compelling reasons to consider investing in the evolving Web3 landscape.

This caused discrepancies in the displayed information for the Pudgy Penguins. The exchange quickly identified the issue and notified CoinMarketCap, which subsequently updated the data. To address user inconvenience, Binance announced a 135 million PENGU token airdrop for those who purchased Pudgy Penguins (PENGU) between 14:00 and 14:37 UTC on December 17. The airdrop will be distributed based on the volume of PENGU tokens each eligible user purchased during the snapshot period. It emphasized that blockchain transparency makes on-chain data the most reliable, with third-party data used for convenience. This swift action by the top crypto exchange underscores its commitment to user satisfaction. By addressing the issue promptly, the exchange not only fixed the problem but also provided compensation to impacted traders. The airdrop serves as a goodwill gesture, reinforcing the exchange’s reputation as a responsive and customer-focused platform. PENGU Token Price Surge and Market Context The PENGU token saw a significant price surge following its listing on Binance , with a 500% increase in its value within 24 hours. At the time of writing, the token exchanged hands at $0.029. Its all-time high reached $0.05, reflecting strong investor interest and market enthusiasm following the listing. The rapid rise in PENGU’s price highlights growing interest in the Pudgy Penguins project. As more users discover the token, further gains are likely. In contrast, the Simon Cat (CAT) token, which also saw a listing on Binance, experienced a decline in its price. The CAT token was trading at $0.000043, down 31% in the last 24 hours. Despite this drop, the token’s market capitalization is at $290 million, with trading volume reaching $600 million. The surge in PENGU’s price highlights the excitement surrounding new listings. This potential for price movement is catching the attention of traders. The performance of one token could influence trends across the broader cryptocurrency market.

Furthermore, the mid-cap altcoin, with a fully diluted valuation of about $16.5B and a daily average traded volume of about $657M, has attracted more institutional investors seeking to diversify their crypto portfolios. The utility-focused and DeFi-based altcoin has rallied over 160 percent since the beginning of November, thus breaking out of the former resistance level around $16.5. Moreover, the UNI/BTC pair has been attempting to initiate a trend reversal, as the altseason shows early signs of entering the parabolic phase. Uniswap Whales Prepares for Major Upswings According to on-chain data analysis provided by Santiment, more than 800k UNI tokens, worth over $13 million, have been deposited to different crypto exchanges in the past two days. Earlier today, spot-on-chain identified a mega whale with $89 million in the crypto portfolio, who deposited 1.49 million UNI, worth over $24 million to the Binance exchange . Earlier this week, the Uniswap team sent nearly 5 million UNI tokens to Coinbase Prime after a dormancy of more than 4 years. Institutions have been depositing $UNI into exchanges over the past 2 days! 1/ Whale “0x59a” with a $89.4M portfolio deposited 1.495M $UNI ($24.3M) to #Binance an hour ago, securing an estimated $13.7M profit (+129%) after 5 months. 2/ @Uniswap team-related wallet “0xa37” sent… pic.twitter.com/DOa7ynLXKn — Spot On Chain (@spotonchain) December 18, 2024 Midterm Targets In the daily time frame, the UNI price against the US dollar has been retesting a crucial resistance/support level above $16, which could easily yield the next bullish phase. Furthermore, the weekly Relative Strength Index (RSI) recently broke out of the 70 percent level for the first time since early this year. With the rising trend established in the higher time frames, UNI’s price is well positioned for at least a 100 percent increase in the near term. In case of short-term correction, UNI price will find a solid support level above $14, before continuing with the bullish outlook. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Crypto Market Live: Markets Consolidating as BTC, ETH & Others Plunge Hard While PENGU & BGB Prices Surge , Market Impact The notable bet on the Uniswap token to continue in a bullish outlook ahead will trigger a similar sentiment for the DeFi space, which has grown to over $138 billion in market cap and a 24-hour trading volume of around $11.4 billion.

After notable changes in its executive team, Binance has shown resilience and prospects for recovery. The departure of Changpeng Zhao, Binance’s CEO, who was also embroiled in legal challenges, initially caused a decline in the value of Binance coin (BNB). Despite this initial setback, the cryptocurrency has shown a positive trend. What next for BNB in the remainder of 2024 and beyond? What can be the future price movements? Let’s get into the BNB price prediction and technical analysis.

Alongside this decline, the overall market sentiment has stayed negative. The gap between the Bollinger Bands reflects market volatility, and the narrowing of this gap signals reduced volatility.

BNB/USDT descends to $711.3 The RSI indicator is positioned in the neutral zone, with its value decreasing to 55.76 over the past 24 hours.

The BNB/USD price has fallen to a low of $711 over the past 24 hours, marking a 0.91% decline for the day. While the bulls dominated the market last week, the bears have regained control today. Technical indicators suggest a bullish trend, but the price charts continue to favor bearish momentum. Is BNB a good investment? Considering the recent price moves, purchasing Binance coins to hold them for an extended period could yield significant returns. From a five-year plan standpoint, it is projected to see a large increase, possibly crossing above $9000 in 2030. However, financial choices shouldn’t be made exclusively based on our data. Why is BNB down? BNB’s price descended over the last 24 hours, above the support at $711. Sellers have recently stepped in to sell the assets; however, the support floor at that level seems stable, as bulls have dominated in the past weeks and the coin is still trading on the higher end of it’s price envelope. Will BNB reach $700? Most crypto analysts, including Wallet Investor and Coincodex, are bullish on BNB. According to Binance coin price prediction, its price is expected to cross the $700 mark by the end of 2024, which would be quite higher than the current Binance coin price. Will BNB reach $2000? Currently, BNB is feeling pressure from legal challenges around its ecosystem. However, as these issues are settled by next year, the coin’s price is expected to start a bull run. As per Binance coin price prediction, BNB will reach nearly $2000 by the end of 2026 and surpass this mark at the start of 2027. Will BNB reach $3000? Binance allows users to save up to 25% on spot margin trading fees by using BNB. Another additional factor is that users can save up to 10% on future trading expenditures with the token, which makes it a primary choice. Binance also uses a significant portion of its earnings to buy back BNB. The burning process also decreases the token supply and increases demand, which is expected to increase in value above $3000 in 2028, according to Binance coin price prediction. Does BNB have a good long-term future? All cryptocurrencies involve risks and uncertainties. However, BNB has a strong market position and a management team that runs the world’s largest cryptocurrency exchange. BNB has the potential for increased utility and is expected to retain a strong position in the cryptocurrency sphere. Binance coin price prediction suggests that holding it for the long haul is a good option, with tenfold expected returns in five years and the price reaching $7000 by 2030. Recent news/opinion on BNB BNB suddenly surges to $742 BNB’s surge began after Binance co-founder Changpeng Zhao, popularly known as ‘CZ,’ shared a tweet on December 3 hinting at the onset of ‘altseason’—a phase where altcoins typically outpace Bitcoin in percentage growth. Binance attributed the gains to CZ’s ‘magic operation,’ referencing a large-scale buyback program and new developments within the Binance ecosystem. Various analysts remain optimistic about BNB, crediting its rise to positive market sentiment and overall growth in the cryptocurrency market.

BNB historic price sentiment Binance coin (BNB) was launched in July 2017 through an Initial Coin Offering (ICO), with an initial price of around $0.10, according to historical crypto market data. As a utility token for the Binance cryptocurrency exchange, it offered users reduced trading fees. In late 2017, BNB’s price significantly increased and reached its first major peak in January 2018, hitting approximately $24. However, it experienced a decline following the broader market correction. BNB price history Throughout 2018 and 2019, BNB’s price experienced gradual growth as the BNB market soared. In 2018 BNB traded near $13 for most of the year but stepped down to $5 by December. However, BNB reached above $30 in June 2019. Despite the global economic uncertainty caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, BNB maintained relative stability and saw an upward trend in 2020. Due to the growing popularity of Binance as an exchange and the expansion of its ecosystem, the coin touched the $34 range in November 2020. BNB experienced a significant bull run in early 2021, reaching a high above $600 in May 2021. Positive market sentiment helped improve its market cap, which remained at an all-time high until recently. Binance Coin’s price dynamics in 2022 were characterized by volatility and were influenced by a combination of macroeconomic factors and regulatory developments around Binance exchange, which led to a bearish scenario. This took BNB to less than $220 in June and an average price of $250 in December. BNB remained a significant player in the cryptocurrency market in 2023, recovering to about $350 in April. However, it soon lost momentum, reaching about $205 in October. In late December, BNB climbed back to about $325. At the beginning of 2024, the Binance Coin traded near $300, rising to $425 by March. It surged further to $600 by the end of the month and peaked at an all-time high of $717.48 on June 6. After fluctuating between $488 and $605 in July and August, BNB recovered to $620 in September and recovered above $590 by the end of October. In November, BNB price went as high as $661 and at the start of December 2024, it is trading near $650 range.",Crypto Price Predictions|Binance|BNB,EN,0,0,EXCHANGE|MARKET|REGULATION|TRADING|BNB|TOKEN SALE,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2024-12-18 07:12:00

Market analysts and community members have been actively engaging in conversations about the digital asset’s possible price in the coming weeks and Cryptoinsightuk (@Cryptoinsightuk), a notable crypto analyst, recently weighed in. Cryptoinsightuk began with a poll asking the community what the asset’s price would be by Christmas Day. Over 2,000 community members responded. 36% of the participants predicted XRP would trade between $2 and $3.30. An additional 30% expected the price to range from $3.30 to $5, while 26% anticipated a value exceeding $5. Notably, only 8% of participants believed the cryptocurrency might fall below $2, indicating strong market confidence. Currently trading at $2.59, XRP has demonstrated notable upward momentum over the past 24 hours, increasing by 5.14%. This ascent, bolstered by the launch of RLUSD, has captured the attention of investors and generated excitement for a continued surge. How High Can XRP Climb By Christmas Day? Cryptoinsightuk shared his personal price projection, suggesting XRP could reach $5 before the end of the year. This forecast aligns with bullish predictions from other market observers. ChatGPT recently predicted that the digital asset could hit $4 on Christmas Day , and if its momentum continues, it could cross the $5 mark by the end of the year. $XRP People asking my thoughts on this.

With a strong focus on tokenizing real-world assets, a Certik-validated security audit, and upcoming listings on top-tier exchanges, RXS is positioned as a low-cost altcoin with explosive growth potential. Already in its 10th presale stage at $0.15, the project has raised over $27.4M and is building momentum as it aims to outpace Shiba Inu (SHIB) by 2025. Dogecoin (DOGE) Dogecoin (DOGE) has shown resilience with a 10.2% rebound following the recent market dip, bolstered by bullish momentum after the U.S. CPI report. The daily chart illustrates key technical indicators aligning for a potential extended recovery, yet resistance and support levels demand close attention. Dogecoin price forecast The primary resistance to monitor is the $0.46 level, marked by the upper Bollinger Band, which represents a critical psychological threshold. A breakout above this zone could pave the way toward the next target of $0.50, a level last tested during earlier bullish sentiment waves. Volume Delta data supports a scenario where consistent buying pressure might push DOGE into new short-term highs, but traders should watch for profit-taking near $0.50. On the downside, immediate support is found at $0.38, aligned with the lower Bollinger Band. Breaching this level could invalidate the bullish outlook, exposing DOGE to further corrections. A drop below $0.38 would open the floor to retest $0.36, where stronger support lies. Rexas Finance (RXS) could be the next Dogecoin (DOGE), poised for explosive growth like DOGE’s 18,400% surge last bull cycle. Rexas Finance (RXS) It is on the verge of a massive breakout.

Or will XRP continue to skyrocket over the next 60 days? Here are 6 of the most current signals regarding XRP’s price . But real quick first: As for more focused long-term accumulation holders and altcoin investors who make cyclical adjustments with the occasional swing trade to optimize their strategy: Is XRP the right place to park it for a while? Is it too Late to Buy XRP in 2024-2025? That’s an important question for many cryptocurrency investors looking at the top coins by market cap for opportunities to achieve their financial goals over their relevant timeframes. Using Bitcoin as a point of comparison, RippleNet does not appear to have reached as much of its TAM (total addressable market) along its product adoption curve. For example, Bitcoin is already on Wall Street as a number of ETF products, and XRP is not. But, Ripple’s CEO Brad Garlinghouse says his company considers an XRP ETF inevitable. Meanwhile, Ripple Labs has actively explored IPO options for some time , but outside the United States, because of the costly battle against the SEC. In addition to that gauge of XRP’s market adoption curve, the Belgium-based SWIFT cooperative is a directly relevant point of comparison. While SWIFT processes international payment volume on the order of USD $5 trillion daily, RippleNet appears to be just getting started. XRP tokens on the decentralized financial platform XRP Ledger facilitate something like USD $1.5 billion worth of similar transactions each day, according to data from XRP Scan. 1. XRP Stablecoin Gets Nod From NY Regulator Last week the New York state financial regulator, the Department of Financial Services, approved a new Ripple stablecoin—RLUSD. The issuer of XRP tokens for RippleNet launched the new product on Dec. 17. XRP token prices on crypto exchanges soared by 11% in market valuation following the regulator’s approval. They jumped from $2.38 to over $2.47 within minutes after the company’s announcement of a launch date. Once the product was released, XRP’s price went even further by tapping a multi-week peak of over $2.7. 2. Ripple Token Technicals Technical signals for Ripple were strong in mid-December. From Dec. 3 – 10, XRP retraced from a high above $2.70 and consolidated above the $1.90 level. XRP’s price then fired back up to above $2.70 on Tuesday, Dec. 17. So the tokens for RippleNet appeared to have found their long-term support level for another leg up in December. That’s impressive price performance and shows great buoyancy after what Jeff Park, chief strategist at crypto asset manager Bitwise, called , in an interview with Fortune, “one of the most violent liquidations we’ve had in the altcoin universe.” The way Park sees it, this retracement looks like a market just stopping briefly to catch its breath: “It looks severe. But the gains were even more astronomical preceding it, and this is a little bit of an exhaustion.” On Tuesday, Ripple’s simple and exponential moving averages across the 10-day, 20-day, 30-day, 50-day, 100-day, and 200-day periods indicated a Strong Buy recommendation, according to data from TradingView. One potential hazard for the XRP army is a large amount of whale-sized transfers to exchanges. That makes the potentially available supply more liquid and could signal selling intent by big players. A November surge of whale transfers doubled Binance’s XRP whale inflows since late October. The last time this metric was this high in Mar. 2024, it preceded a 3-month slide for the asset. 3. Strong Business Model, America’s ‘Secret’ Weapon? This fundamental evaluation of Ripple’s long-term future prospects as a payments business cannot be understated. Ripple maintains a SaaS product that is so good with a business and team around it that are so capable that RippleNet could be the US’s secret weapon to maintain global financial hegemony in the face of a fading dollar . That’s why popular digital asset researcher X Anderson, in a recent post, called XRP “a strategic weapon for the US.” Main reasons why Ripple along with XRP is a strategic weapon for the US: Ripple has built a next-generation B2B cross-border payments system controlled by a US company. RLUSD will be able to expand the usage of USD around the world, especially for financial institutions… — Anders (@X__Anderson) December 2, 2024 “Ripple has built a next-generation B2B cross-border payments system controlled by a US company,” Anderson wrote. “Ripple holds roughly 45% of all XRP, meaning a US-based company is the largest holder of XRP.” 4. XRP Ledger Daily TXs Trending Up For another fundamental analysis, the daily transaction volume on the XRP Ledger for decentralized finance may be cause for trader/investor bullishness into January. Total payments from one account to another increased from 0.73 million daily on Sept. 17 to 1.4 million daily on Dec. 16, nearly doubling in three months’ time. Accordingly, payment volume in XRP tokens using the XRP Ledger increased over the same period, from 762 million to 1.99 billion. Daily active accounts on XRP Ledger have also kept pace with the appreciating crypto spot exchange price for the Ripple token. Daily unique senders rose to over 105K on Dec. 2. The previous record was just a touch over 50K each of the three times this metric ever came anything close to this month’s all-time high. Daily new account activation figures are also bullish. 5. Trump Effect, Ripple SEC Lawsuit Dust Settles The outgoing Biden administration’s war on cryptocurrency via a very aggressive SEC is at an end with the incoming second one for New York City and cable television’s Donald Trump. The president-elect’s appointment of Peter Thiel’s PayPal apprentice, David Sacks, to be his crypto and AI czar is more proof the new White House will be friendly and supportive of cryptocurrencies like XRP. In a November tweet, Ripple Chief Legal Officer Stuart Alderoty stated that Ripple’s defense against the SEC in US court “provided the blueprint to defeat Gary Gensler’s inexplicable war on crypto.” During a recent 60 Minutes interview, Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse said his company recently launched a new crypto-focused US super PAC named Fairshake because of the SEC’s “war on crypto.” Its influence on policymakers will come with the gravitas of its legal victories, its international business partnerships with foreign governments and financial institutions, and its vast honeypot of financial resources and clearly no shortage of cash—not even through a prolonged and expensive SEC battle happening at the same time as a severe cyclical bear market for the crypto industry. 6. Dollar and Bitcoin Macro Cycles The dollar is in an inflationary, low-interest rate cycle for the time being. Meanwhile, Bitcoin is in its historical 12 – 18-month bullish price adjustment phase following a 50% supply cut every four years. This quadrennial’s “halving” occurred on April 20, 2024. As a result, XRP’s price is caught up in a very broad, macro-cycle, multi-month financial updraft that, in many previous cycles, has dramatically increased the daily market exchange rate for altcoins like XRP. #XRP is not dumping, it’s a whole market thing. Triggered by #BTC dump. Fundamentals are very strong for XRP, if you’re a holder, my gut is telling me it will hit $5 by Feb 2025. All this is noise. Not Financial Advice. I am not qualified to give any advice. pic.twitter.com/33dtboWwRl — Vincent Van Code (@vincent_vancode) December 5, 2024 An AI startup founder and Ripple investor who goes by Vincent Van Code on X recently pointed to a $5 target level for XRP’s price by February. Just as Ripple’s price began to retrace in early December, Van Code wrote, “Fundamentals are very strong for XRP, if you’re a holder, my gut is telling me it will hit $5 by Feb 2025. All this is noise.” The post 6 Signs Ripple (XRP) Is About to Make Another Colossal Splash appeared first on CryptoPotato .",Crypto News|featured1|XRPBTC|XRPUSD|Donald Trump|Ripple (XRP) Price|SEC,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|MARKET|REGULATION|TRADING|XRP,"{'name': 'Crypto Potato', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopotato.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopotato,2024-12-18 07:23:42

Here Are the Details,https://en.bitcoinsistemi.com/us-treasury-department-sanctions-this-countrys-cryptocurrency-laundering-network-here-are-the-details/,"The U.S. Treasury Department has imposed sanctions on two individuals and an organization accused of laundering cryptocurrency for North Korea, as part of the country’s efforts to counter illicit financial activities. US Sanctions North Korea's Crypto Laundering Network The Treasury's Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) identified Lu Huaying and Zhang Jian, both Chinese citizens, as key figures in the money laundering network. These individuals are alleged to have facilitated money laundering on behalf of Sim Hyon Sop, the sanctioned banking representative of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK). The duo reportedly operated through a front company in the United Arab Emirates called Green Alpine Trading, which has also been designated a sanctioned entity. The company is accused of serving as a central hub in the network. The U.S. Treasury has highlighted North Korea’s role in using its agents and proxies to conduct illicit financial activities, including cryptocurrency theft, fraudulent IT work, and money laundering. According to the Treasury, these funds support North Korea’s weapons of mass destruction (WMD) and ballistic missile programs. North Korean hacker groups, including the infamous Lazarus Group, have been linked to some of the largest cryptocurrency heists in history, including the $600 million hack of the Ronin Ethereum sidechain in 2022. North Korean Hackers' Deceptive Tactics North Korean hackers reportedly use tactics such as impersonating recruiters or executives of legitimate cryptocurrency firms to trick their targets. For example, blockchain security firm SlowMist revealed that a Lazarus Group hacker once pretended to be an executive from Chinese blockchain firm Fenbushi Capital and convinced victims on LinkedIn to click on malicious links. *This is not investment advice.

However, for ETH to reach this milestone, it must surpass the critical resistance level of $4,000. Ethereum Spot ETFs Attracting Consistent Inflows According to data from SoSoValue, Ethereum spot ETF inflows have remained consistently positive since November 22. The cumulative net inflows total $2.32 billion, with a significant $1.5 billion added between November 22 and December 16 alone. Related Reading: Ethereum Finally Set For A New All-Time High? Here’s What Analysts Say Breaking it down by weekly inflows, the week ending December 13 saw net inflows of $854.85 million, closely followed by $836.69 million during the week ending December 6. Moreover, the total net assets held by Ethereum ETFs have climbed to $14.28 billion, which represents approximately 2.93% of ETH’s total circulating supply. Grayscale’s Ethereum Trust (ETHE) ranks as the largest holder with $5.87 billion in net assets, followed by Blackrock’s iShares Ethereum Trust (ETHA) with $4.02 billion. These strong inflows into Ethereum ETFs have bolstered bullish sentiment, with Ethereum bulls anticipating a possible rally to a new ATH for the second-largest cryptocurrency by market cap. Crypto analyst Momin Saqib took X to share his thoughts on ETH price action. The analyst noted that ETH looks poised to break through the local highs of the $4,000 range and is eyeing the $4,500 price level. He added: Ethereum inflows have been coming in non-stop for the last few weeks! After seeing $BTC at $107K…. I think institutions don’t have much options left to bet on higher upside of crypto industry! Higher! Looking at Ethereum’s weekly chart, the digital asset has made four significant attempts to break through the $4,000 resistance level. While it briefly surpassed this level during its second attempt, creating its current ATH of $4,878, it ultimately proved to be a false breakout, followed by a prolonged bear market over the next two years. Analyst Rekt Capital noted that ETH’s post-breakout retest of the $3,100 price level was successful, propelling the cryptocurrency back into the $4,000 zone. They highlighted that ETH has held above the $4,000 zone as support for the second consecutive week, a key development that could pave the way for further upward momentum. Despite The Potential Upside, ETH Traders Remain Cautious While strengthening fundamentals, bullish technical indicators, and persistent ETF inflows paint a positive picture for Ethereum, some analysts remain cautiously optimistic about ETH’s short-term price action. Related Reading: Ethereum Crosses $3,800: Is The ‘God Candle’ Nearing? Analysts Weigh In For instance, analyst CryptoBullet emphasized that ETH may see a quick wick to $3,700 before rebounding. The analyst added that ETH’s ability to hold above key resistance levels indicates its strong bullish momentum. Another factor potentially dampening short-term optimism is Justin Sun, founder of Tron (TRX), who recently unstaked $208 million worth of ETH from Lido Finance. This move has raised concerns about potential selling pressure. ETH trades at $3,947 at press time, down 0.2% in the past 24 hours.

Bloomberg ETF analyst Eric Balchunas predicts that altcoin ETFs for XRP, Litecoin (LTC), Hedera (HBAR), and Solana (SOL) are likely to secure approval soon. In a post on X (formerly Twitter), Balchunas highlighted that the initial wave of altcoin ETFs may include Bitcoin (BTC) and Ether (ETH) combination ETFs, followed by Litecoin ETFs.

It is expected that the US Fed will make some important announcements after the meeting. There is a high chance of the announcement of a 25 basis points interest rate cut. Let’s examine the scenario. US Fed Expected to Cut Rates Again According to Kalshi, there is at least a 96% probability that the Federal Reserve will announce a 25 basis points rate cut today. There is currently a 96% chance the Fed will cut 25bps tomorrow This would be the Fed's third rate cut of 2024 for a total of 100bps pic.twitter.com/AReQQXK8bQ — Kalshi (@Kalshi) December 17, 2024 This year, the US Fed has already executed at least two rate cuts. Once the new rate cut is implemented, the total rate cuts of 2024 will reach as high as 100 basis points. US Inflation Metrics Back on the Rise Inflation pressure has risen sharply in the last couple of months. This adds complexity to the Federal Reserve’s attempt to stabilise the economy. At the start of this year, the US CPI Index was as low as 308.417 Points. In April, it rose to 313.55 points. In October, it touched the yearly peak of 315.66 Points. However, in November, it slightly dropped to 315.49 Points. In January, 2024, the US Producer Prices index was at 142.683 Points. In June, it reached 144.834 Points. Since June, it has grown consistently. In November, it touched a yearly peak of 146.493 Points. At the beginning of the year, the US Personal Consumption Expenditure Price index was around 122.115 Points. In April, it touched a peak of 123.234 Points. Since June, it has surged steadily. In September, it was at 123.931 Points. In October, it climbed to a monthly peak of 124.266 Points. US Labour Market Challenges It was the deteriorating situation in the US job market that primarily prompted the policymakers to consider the rate cut option. Though initially the job market witnessed certain improvements, recently it began weakening. The US Initial Jobless Claims index was 224K on November 30. In the first week of December, it rebounded to 242K – the level it was at least 8 weeks earlier. On November 23, the US Continuing Jobless Claims index was at 1.87K Thousand. On November 30, it surged to 1.89K Thousand. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Will South Korea Punish Crypto Tax Evaders?

Binance Australia derivatives exchange trading as Oztures Trading Pty Ltd misclassified over 500 clients as wholesale clients. ASIC Files Lawsuit Against Binance Australia Derivatives In a press release on December 18, the Australian regulator ASIC said it has sued Binance Australia Derivatives. The regulator alleges that the exchange offered crypto derivative products to 505 retail investors , misclassifying them as wholesale. From July 7, 2022–April 21, 2023, Australian retail investors were denied critical consumer protections under Australian financial services laws. This represents 83% of its Australian client base . ASIC claims that retail investors trading crypto derivative products need consumer protections, including disclosure statement and compliant dispute resolution scheme access. Also, the regulator highlighted that Binance Australia Derivatives also failed to make Target Market Determination (TMD) under design and distribution obligations. “Binance allegedly failed to ensure that the services it provided under its Australian financial services licence were provided efficiently, honestly and fairly,” said ASIC Deputy Chair Sarah Court . In addition, it added that Binance’s compliance systems were inadequate and exposed investors to high-risk, speculative products without consumer protections. Besides, many clients have suffered significant financial losses. The exchange needs to comply with the conditions of its license, claims the regulator. Binance’s Arm Faced Problems in 2023 Binance’s Australian arm has a history of regulatory challenges and conflicts with the regulator. In June 2023, Binance Australia ceased Australian dollar (AUD) deposits and withdrawals by bank transfer. Earlier, Australian Securities and Investments Commission canceled the derivatives license of Binance Australia Derivatives in April. It began a probe against the exchange for mistakenly categorizing traders as wholesale investors. Recently, Australian regulator ASIC released draft guidance offering greater clarity on digital asset regulation and current financial product definitions. However, it faced criticism from crypto industry experts, warning exodus of firms from the country.

The stablecoin aims to drive innovation, expand use cases, and increase engagement within the XRPL ecosystem. The XRPL, renowned for its speed, scalability, and cost-efficiency, was built to support assets, including cryptocurrencies and fiat-backed tokens. According to Ripple’s Chief Technology Officer David Schwartz, the introduction of RLUSD brings significant advantages to the decentralized exchange (DEX) on the XRPL. In a recent video shared to X by Amelie (@_Crypto_Barbie), Schwartz highlighted how credible assets like RLUSD could enhance trading volumes, benefiting developers, users, and applications. The Role of XRP and RLUSD in the Ecosystem A standout feature of the XRPL DEX is its auto-bridging mechanism. This feature automatically identifies XRP as an intermediary to facilitate trades between different assets, ensuring transaction efficiency. Schwartz noted that the integration of RLUSD will further optimize this process, as it fosters more trading activity on the platform. RLUSD also has the distinction of having NYDFS approval , which places it above its peers. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 According to Schwartz, XRP and RLUSD complement each other due to their differing characteristics. While XRP is optimized for use as a bridge currency, RLUSD’s stability enables applications in sectors such as real-world asset tokenization, foreign exchange markets, and trade financing. One of the primary benefits of RLUSD lies in its potential to unlock new opportunities for developers and builders in the blockchain space. The demand for stablecoins has been increasing, driven by their utility in facilitating global transactions and reducing volatility. Ripple’s stablecoin aims to capitalize on this trend by encouraging innovative on-chain applications. For Ripple’s proprietary payment solutions, Schwartz revealed that XRP will continue to serve its purpose as a bridge currency. However, RLUSD’s introduction allows Ripple to expand its ecosystem into new areas. Schwartz emphasized that this move positions Ripple to address the growing demand for stablecoin-based applications, particularly in markets that require price stability. The XRPL recently experienced a boom because of meme coins , and the attention from RLUSD could take the ecosystem to new heights. Schwartz closed the video stating, “We’re entering a growing market expected to see significant expansion, especially with stablecoins. Builders will certainly take advantage of the new opportunities presented by this ecosystem.” Disclaimer : This content is meant to inform and should not be considered financial advice.

PDX Beam is set to become the first ever end-to-end payment transaction process and crypto-to-cash payments platform for merchants and consumers. PDX Global, the developer company, recently finished a round of testing for the app and claimed it is ready for a live public beta test on Dec. 19. According to the press release received by crypto.news, PDX Beam offers users instant crypto-to-cash settlements directly on the blockchain-based platform, without having to go through traditional intermediaries such as credit cards and banks. Once the app is publicly accessible, users will be able to avoid banking charges and payment delays by using PDX Beam to convert crypto into cash within seconds. Users simply have to sign up to PDX Beam and link their secure wallet. To make crypto payments in-store or online, the app will convert the user’s crypto funds into local currency after paying the mandatory gas fees for network use on the relevant blockchain . The free app claims the user does not need to have a “special exchange account” to make the purchase. On the other hand, merchants will be able to accept crypto funds from consumers without needing to own a crypto account or even touching the crypto side of the transaction. This is because PDX Beam is integrated with point-of-sale systems and business software. The app is also gearing up to facilitate physical and online purchases for marketplace platforms like Clover and Shopify. By bridging the gap between crypto and traditional currencies, the platform further expands on the potential of crypto as a form of payment for every day use.

The team expects the platform to be able to complete transactions in 15 seconds or less by the time the software is launched. CEO of PDX Global, Shane Rodgers, stated that most merchants still believe that they must allocate a significant amount of funds into crypto payment systems in order to start accepting crypto from customers. With PDX Beam, merchants can simply integrate the app into their systems using any POS Terminal equipped with an API or custom code for QR scanning without additional costs to accept crypto payments. “Transactions can be settled either in same day ACH [Automated Clearing House] or real-time instant settlement at the merchant’s option, reducing fees to a fraction of the transaction cost of a debit or credit card,” said Rodgers. According to a recent survey by Deloitte, around 85% of merchants in the U.S. expect crypto will be used for daily payments in the few years ahead.

Kim Nam-guk’s Trial Sets a Precedent,https://coinpedia.org/news/will-south-korea-punish-crypto-tax-evaders-kim-nam-guks-trial-sets-a-precedent/,"The post Will South Korea Punish Crypto Tax Evaders? Kim Nam-guk’s Trial Sets a Precedent appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News In an eye-opening case, Recently Kim Nam-guk, a former lawmaker from South Korea’s Democratic Party is accused of hiding his crypto wealth. Prosecutors have requested to the Seoul Southern District Court a six-month prison sentence for Kim on charges of intentionally hiding a large sum of cryptocurrency in his asset declarations to the National Assembly, which he is legally required to submit. The case shows South Korea’s zero tolerance for defaulters in crypto tax-related cases. The case is heating a crypto tax debate and how to tackle such cases in the current scenario where crypto assets are seen as a safety net by many small-scale traders and investors. How Kim Hid His Cryptocurrency ? According to the prosecutors, Kim planned to hide his crypto assets from the National Assembly’s Ethics Committee, which reviews the financial details of lawmakers. He transferred a significant portion of his crypto holdings to a regular bank account to make it appear as though he was not holding coins. Plus, he misreported his total assets, falsely declaring much lower amounts than he possessed. This was done by converting some of his coin deposits into regular bank deposits and reporting them as part of his total assets while keeping the actual value of his cryptocurrency hidden. False Declarations in 2021 and 2022 Kim’s asset declarations in both 2021 and 2022 were significantly lower than what he truly owned. In 2021, he declared assets worth approximately 1.2 billion won, but prosecutors believe he had 9.9 billion won in cryptocurrency at the time. Kim in his Defense Despite being a serious tax defaulter, Last month, Kim Nam-guk criticized his party’s push for virtual asset taxation, calling it an ineffective move to gain more support. The Democratic Party is currently discussing a revision of the tax law to increase the tax deduction limit for virtual assets to 50 million won, as promised in the last election. The court will soon decide on his punishment, which could set a precedent for how such cases are handled in the future.

Santa Rides Shiba (SANTSHIB), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 19,000% in price in the coming days. This is because SANTSHIB is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Santa Rides Shiba can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Santa Rides Shiba could become the next viral memecoin. Santa Rides Shiba launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Santa Rides Shiba on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Santa Rides Shiba by entering its contract address – CxpeR8vdgeVWZFwBytS7PRrXHBwVgPJWZBJUcpK3k7vT – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like SANTSHIB. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Press Releases,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|DOGE|EXCHANGE|SHIB|SOL,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2024-12-18 08:04:00

These comments have fueled speculations, especially amid soaring optimism over pro-crypto regulations and a Bitcoin strategic reserve in the US. Besides, it also comes as the broader market experienced a setback today, which has left investors looking for potential reasons behind the latest dip. Arthur Hayes Predicts Crypto Market Crash Ahead Arthur Hayes’s recent blog showed that the BitMEX co-founder is expecting a crypto market crash as soon as next month. This comment has fueled speculations, especially as Bitcoin and top altcoins have recorded a robust rally recently. However, despite the gloomy predictions, it appears that the expert remains optimistic on the long-term trajectory of BTC and the broader market. In his recent Blog, Hayes said that the crypto rally started with Donald Trump’s election victory in November. Notably, Trump’s pledge to make the US the crypto capital and hinting towards a Bitcoin Strategic Reserve has fueled market optimism, which has helped gains in the sector. While Hayes also lauded the Bitcoin Strategic Reserve (BSR) development, he also said “I still don’t believe that BSR will happen.” He believes that politicians would rather spend newly created dollars on public goods than invest in Bitcoin. Despite that, he remained optimistic about the long-term BTC trajectory, noting that just the discussions over BSR have created a “buying pressure” in the market. He further stated: “While I don’t believe the US government will purchase Bitcoin, it doesn’t affect my positive price outlook.” Meanwhile, despite the optimism, Hayes predicts short-term corrections for BTC during its run toward the $1 million mark. In addition, he also said that a crypto market crash is likely in January around Trump’s inauguration day on January 20. However, despite the gloomy outlook, he said that following the “harrowing dump”, the market will witness a “crack-up-boom phase in the crypto bull market.” Bitcoin & Altcoins Retreat Sparking Speculations The recent global shift towards the digital assets space has sparked a robust rally in Bitcoin and other crypto. Notably, EU politicians have also called for a Bitcoin Strategic Reserve recently, following the global buzz after Donald Trump hinted towards a similar move for the US. Considering all these aspects, the market sentiment appeared to have remained high. However, despite that, the recent dip in the market has fueled speculations. Besides, Arthur Hayes’s warning about a potential crypto market crash ahead has further triggered discussions in the market. It appears that some investors are booking profits after the recent massive rally, which has weighed on the broader market performance. In addition, the market participants might be taking a pause ahead of the US FOMC later today , which would provide cues on the Fed’s rate cut policy stance and the broader economic health. How’s The Crypto Market Performing? The global crypto market cap declined nearly 3% today to $3.64 trillion, with Arthur Hayes’s crypto market crash prediction further weighing on sentiments. Bitcoin price today recorded a dip of 2.5% to $104,140, after touching its ATH of $108,268.45 in the last 24 hours. Despite the recent dip, BTC noted monthly gains of 13%. On the other hand, the latest Ethereum price showed a decline of 4% to $3,851, a day after the crypto crossed the brief $4K mark. Cardano price retreated 4%, while XRP slipped 1%, despite RLUSD launch optimism and soaring whale activity recently. Among the top meme coins , Dogecoin price today was down nearly 4% to $0.3845. On the other hand, Shiba Inu price dipped about 5% while Pepe Coin retreated more than 7% in the last 24 hours. However, despite the recent setback noted in the broader digital assets space, it appears that the market experts remained optimistic about the long-term picture of the sector.

Matthew Sigel, the head of digital assets research at VanEck, says in a new interview with Natalie Brunell that the reserve might not be generated from Congressional legislation, however. “I think more likely it’ll be an executive action that tries to reclassify the roughly 200,000 Bitcoin that the US government already owns, having seized in crimes or other events, and just call that a Bitcoin reserve and pledge not to sell it. Our prediction for next year is that there will either be a national Bitcoin reserve like what I’ve just described, or that one or a handful of states will pass their own, and I think the most likely candidates for that are Pennsylvania, Florida or Texas.” In July, Republican Senator Cynthia Lummis of Wyoming said she would announce a bill to establish a BTC reserve as a means of securing the value of the US dollar amid a record-breaking national debt. The legislation would drive the US government to accumulate one million BTC, or 5% of BTC’s total supply in five years. On the campaign trail this year, President-elect Donald Trump promised that the US would stop selling its trove of seized Bitcoin on the open market and instead strategically hold the asset as an investment. Earlier this month, a member of the Texas House of Representatives proposed new legislation that would enable the Lone Star State to establish a strategic Bitcoin reserve within its treasury. The decentralized betting platform Polymarket currently prices the odds that Trump will create a Bitcoin reserve in his first 100 days in office at 41%.

Tracked by CoinMarketCap (CMC), this index measures the market’s shift between Bitcoin and altcoins based on their relative performance over 90 days. With a score above 50, the market remains in Altcoin Season , a period when altcoins outperform Bitcoin in price gains. This shift indicates a growing preference among investors for altcoins, which can offer higher volatility and potentially greater returns. But what does this drop in the index mean for traders and the broader crypto market? Understanding the Altcoin Season Index 1. How the Index Works The Altcoin Season Index evaluates the performance of the top 100 cryptocurrencies , excluding stablecoins and wrapped tokens, compared to Bitcoin over the past 90 days. The scoring system is simple: Above 75: Strong Altcoin Season, with most coins outperforming Bitcoin. Below 25: Bitcoin Season, with Bitcoin dominating altcoin performance. The index serves as a barometer for market sentiment, guiding traders on whether to focus on Bitcoin or diversify into altcoins. 2. Altcoin vs. Bitcoin Performance For the market to be in Altcoin Season, 75% or more of altcoins need to outperform Bitcoin. At 59, the index indicates a balanced but altcoin-leaning market, reflecting a competitive environment where altcoins are holding their ground. What a Drop to 59 Signals The three-point drop in the index suggests subtle shifts in market dynamics. While the score remains in Altcoin Season territory, the reduced margin hints at Bitcoin regaining some relative strength. Here’s what this means: 1. Increased Bitcoin Activity The drop may signify rising interest in Bitcoin, possibly due to macroeconomic factors or significant news, such as regulatory developments or institutional adoption. 2. Consolidation Among Altcoins Altcoin performance may be consolidating as traders take profits from recent rallies. This can lead to decreased momentum and reduced index scores. 3. Investor Sentiment A slight decline in the index could reflect shifting sentiment, with investors cautiously returning to Bitcoin or waiting for clear market trends before making significant moves. Why Altcoin Season Remains Strong Despite the minor drop, the crypto market remains firmly in Altcoin Season. Here’s why altcoins continue to shine: 1. Diversification and Innovation Altcoins often provide exposure to emerging blockchain technologies, from DeFi platforms to NFT ecosystems. This diversification attracts investors looking for the next big opportunity. 2. Higher Volatility Altcoins tend to exhibit greater price swings, which can lead to substantial short-term gains. Traders capitalizing on these movements contribute to altcoin dominance. 3. Bitcoin Saturation As Bitcoin matures, its price gains become less dramatic compared to smaller-cap altcoins. This dynamic encourages investors to explore altcoin projects with higher growth potential. Top Performing Altcoins Driving the Index While Bitcoin remains the market leader, several altcoins have outperformed it recently, contributing to the Altcoin Season Index score: Ethereum (ETH): With its strong presence in decentralized finance (DeFi) and upcoming updates, ETH continues to attract significant investment. Solana (SOL): Known for its scalability and low transaction costs, Solana has seen substantial adoption. Polygon (MATIC): Benefiting from Layer 2 scaling solutions, Polygon has gained traction among developers and users alike. Pepe (PEPE): A meme coin gaining popularity due to community-driven hype and speculation. Risks and Opportunities During Altcoin Season Opportunities High Returns: Altcoins often deliver exponential returns during this phase. Emerging Projects: It’s a great time to identify and invest in innovative blockchain projects. Risks Volatility: While altcoins can generate massive gains, they are also prone to steep corrections. Market Sentiment Swings: A sudden shift toward Bitcoin or external factors like regulatory crackdowns can impact altcoin performance. What to Watch for Moving Forward 1. Bitcoin’s Influence A significant rally or increased dominance by Bitcoin could push the Altcoin Season Index lower. Watch for Bitcoin breaking key resistance levels or news of institutional inflows. 2. Regulatory Developments Government policies toward cryptocurrencies, especially altcoins, could shape the market’s direction. Favorable regulations might strengthen Altcoin Season, while crackdowns could boost Bitcoin’s relative appeal. 3. Altcoin-Specific Innovations Keep an eye on advancements within the altcoin ecosystem, such as new protocol upgrades, partnerships, or use cases that could drive further outperformance. Conclusion: The Implications of a 59 Altcoin Season Index The Altcoin Season Index’s drop to 59 reflects a nuanced market where altcoins still outperform Bitcoin but with reduced dominance. This balance provides opportunities for traders who diversify their portfolios, leveraging both Bitcoin’s stability and altcoins’ growth potential. As the crypto market evolves, staying informed about trends like the Altcoin Season Index can help investors make smarter decisions. Whether you’re holding Bitcoin, trading altcoins, or exploring new blockchain projects, understanding these dynamics is crucial for navigating the ever-changing world of cryptocurrency.

Layer-2 scaling solutions, such as Mantle Network and Manta Network, are gaining traction by improving transaction throughput and reducing congestion. However, Razewin offers an entirely different approach with its mobile-based mining system. This article will compare Layer-2 solutions to Razewin’s technology, examining which is better suited for the next phase of blockchain development. Layer-2 Solutions and Blockchain Scalability Layer-2 solutions are designed to improve the scalability of existing blockchain networks, particularly those based on Ethereum. By offloading transactions from Layer-1 blockchains, Layer-2 solutions help reduce congestion and lower gas fees. Popular Layer-2 technologies include rollups, sidechains, and state channels, all of which aim to make blockchain networks more efficient. Mantle Network, for example, uses a rollup-based system that allows for faster, cheaper transactions. By processing transactions off-chain and bundling them into a single batch, Mantle reduces the load on Ethereum’s mainnet, enhancing scalability without sacrificing security. Similarly, Manta Network focuses on privacy and scalability, using zero-knowledge proofs to create a secure and efficient Layer-2 solution. Razewin’s Energy-Efficient Alternative While Layer-2 solutions focus on improving transaction speeds and lowering fees, they still rely on the energy-intensive Proof-of-Work (PoW) mining system for network security. Razewin, on the other hand, takes a completely different approach by using mobile-based mining that requires far less energy than traditional PoW methods. Razewin’s system allows users to mine cryptocurrency via their smartphones, turning physical movement into mining rewards. This not only reduces the environmental impact of mining but also makes it more accessible to a broader audience. By using a mobile-first approach, Razewin sidesteps the scalability challenges faced by traditional blockchains while also offering a more sustainable solution. Which Technology Is Leading the Next Revolution? Both Layer-2 solutions and Razewin’s mobile mining model represent important innovations in the blockchain space. Layer-2 technologies are essential for improving the scalability of existing blockchains, particularly for decentralized applications (dApps) that require fast and cheap transactions. However, they do not address the environmental concerns associated with PoW mining. Razewin, on the other hand, tackles both scalability and energy efficiency by offering a low-energy alternative to traditional mining. Its mobile-based system is more sustainable and accessible, making it a strong contender for the future of blockchain technology. Conclusion Layer-2 solutions and Razewin’s mobile-based mining model each offer unique advantages for the future of blockchain. Layer-2 scaling improves transaction throughput and reduces fees, but it does not address the environmental impact of mining. Razewin’s sustainable, low-energy approach provides an alternative that could lead the next wave of blockchain innovation, especially as the demand for eco-friendly solutions grows.

Musk Loves Bitcoin (MUSKBTC), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 13,000% in price in the coming days. This is because MUSKBTC is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Musk Loves Bitcoin can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Musk Loves Bitcoin could become the next viral memecoin. Musk Loves Bitcoin launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Musk Loves Bitcoin on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Musk Loves Bitcoin by entering its contract address – 35GthqqwTd9HokNVfUzGpjsALCJbeUXXeKeJcrPCZsJB – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like MUSKBTC. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Press Releases,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|DOGE|SHIB|SOL,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2024-12-18 09:28:00

Timing the Market Evolution Predicting 2025 as the “year of digital assets” suggests a timeline for significant milestones, including: Widespread adoption of digital currencies. Clarity in U.S. regulatory policies. Integration of blockchain technology into mainstream industries. 3. Bridging Innovation and Regulation Lummis’ advocacy highlights the balance between fostering innovation and implementing regulations to protect consumers while encouraging growth in the digital asset ecosystem. The Current State of Digital Assets Rising Institutional Interest Major corporations, hedge funds, and investment platforms are increasingly adding Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies to their portfolios. Regulatory Developments The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) are actively working to clarify their roles in regulating digital assets. Technological Advancements Blockchain technology continues to evolve, offering scalable solutions that address challenges like security, speed, and interoperability. What Could Make 2025 a Game-Changer? 1. Regulatory Clarity The implementation of comprehensive cryptocurrency regulations could provide the legal certainty needed for mass adoption. Key areas include: Stablecoin regulations. Licensing requirements for crypto exchanges. Consumer protection policies. 2. Institutional Adoption With Bitcoin ETFs already surpassing gold ETFs in assets under management, 2025 could see even greater institutional involvement. 3. Retail Adoption User-friendly apps, wallets, and educational initiatives could drive retail participation, making cryptocurrencies more accessible to the average consumer. 4. Technological Breakthroughs Advancements in blockchain scalability, security, and interoperability could position digital assets as practical solutions for industries ranging from finance to supply chain management. Wyoming’s Role in the Crypto Revolution Wyoming, under Lummis’ influence, has become a hub for crypto innovation: Crypto-Friendly Laws: The state has enacted 24 pro-crypto laws, offering clarity and support for blockchain companies. First Crypto Banks: Wyoming is home to the first crypto banks, like Kraken and Avanti, which operate under a special-purpose depository institution (SPDI) charter. Incentives for Blockchain Companies: Low taxes and business-friendly policies attract blockchain startups to the state. Global Trends Supporting Lummis’ Prediction 1. Nation-State Adoption Countries like El Salvador and others have adopted Bitcoin as legal tender, setting a precedent for broader government-level adoption. 2. Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDCs) Numerous central banks are exploring or launching CBDCs, highlighting the global shift toward digital finance. 3. Decentralized Finance (DeFi) DeFi platforms are democratizing access to financial services, offering alternatives to traditional banking systems. 4. Tokenization of Assets From real estate to art, tokenization is creating new opportunities for fractional ownership and liquidity in previously illiquid markets. Challenges on the Road to 2025 While the future looks promising, several obstacles need to be addressed: 1. Regulatory Uncertainty Ongoing debates in the U.S. about which agencies should oversee digital assets continue to create confusion. 2. Market Volatility Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies are notorious for their price volatility, which could deter conservative investors. 3. Security Concerns Hacks and fraud remain significant issues in the crypto space, emphasizing the need for robust cybersecurity measures. 4. Public Perception Misinformation and skepticism about cryptocurrencies could slow adoption rates. The Role of Legislation and Advocacy Key Legislative Developments Bitcoin Strategic Reserve Bills: States like Ohio and Texas are considering strategic Bitcoin reserves, showcasing growing state-level support for digital assets. Federal Initiatives: The Biden administration and incoming President-elect Trump have both discussed frameworks for cryptocurrency regulation. Advocacy Efforts Lummis and other pro-crypto lawmakers are working to educate their peers about the benefits and risks of digital assets, aiming to create a balanced regulatory environment. What 2025 Could Look Like for Digital Assets Mainstream Integration Digital assets could become an integral part of everyday transactions, from retail purchases to international remittances. Enhanced Financial Inclusion Cryptocurrencies and blockchain technology could provide financial services to the unbanked and underbanked populations worldwide. Booming Ecosystems DeFi, NFTs, and tokenized assets could see exponential growth, creating new opportunities for investment and innovation. Global Leadership Countries and states embracing digital assets early could position themselves as leaders in the emerging digital economy. Conclusion: A Vision for the Future Cynthia Lummis’ prediction that 2025 will be the year of Bitcoin and digital assets underscores the rapid progress and growing importance of cryptocurrencies in today’s financial landscape. With advancements in technology, increasing institutional adoption, and ongoing legislative efforts, the stage is set for a transformative shift in how the world views and uses digital assets.

However, concerns about the company’s financial stability tied to the Bitcoin price have emerged, particularly from Ki Young Ju, CEO of CryptoQuant. Ju cautioned that while the prospect of MicroStrategy facing bankruptcy is not impossible, it would require an event as unlikely as “an asteroid hitting Earth.” MicroStrategy’s Financial Risks As Bitcoin Price Floor Holds At $30,000 In a recent post on X (formerly Twitter), Ju elaborated on the matter by stating that BTC has maintained a consistent price floor, never dropping below the long-term cost basis of major holders, which currently stands at $30,000. He noted: MicroStrategy’s debt is $7 billion, while its Bitcoin holdings are valued at $46 billion. Based solely on Bitcoin, the liquidation price would be around $16,500. The last cycle’s bottom was at $16,000. Talking about a drop to that level now feels as improbable as predicting $3,000 when Bitcoin was at $60,000. Related Reading: Ethereum Reaches $4,100 For The First Time In Over Three Years, Aiming For $5,000 Next In the context of current price movements, CryptoQuant noted that the price surge toward BTC’s new all-time high above $108,000 on Tuesday was fueled by short liquidations totaling approximately $151 million over the past 12 hours, The firm disclosed that the Bitcoin-to-gold ratio also reached an all-time high during this surge, reinforcing Bitcoin’s reputation as “digital gold” and affirming its role as a preferred store of value compared to traditional gold assets. Additionally, MicroStrategy’s recent inclusion in the Nasdaq 100 has bolstered market sentiment. Saylor hinted at further Bitcoin purchases, even with spot prices exceeding $100,000. CryptoQuant asserts that this inclusion could lead to passive fund inflows into MicroStrategy shares, providing the company with greater access to capital for its Bitcoin acquisitions. BTC Purchases For Sixth Consecutive Weeks Saylor stated on Monday that Microstrategy has purchased the market’s leading crypto for the sixth week in a row. This transaction adds to the firm’s considerable Bitcoin portfolio, which currently stands at 439,000 BTC, acquired for around $27.1 billion at an average price of $61,725 per coin. Additionally, Saylor revealed that the firm’s Bitcoin assets have produced significant gains, with a 46.4% increase quarter-to-date (QTD) and a 72.4% gain year-to-date (YTD). Related Reading: Solana Monthly Chart ‘Looks Ready For A Monster Run’ – Details CryptoQuant also noted that this week’s central bank meetings appear to be secondary to market sentiment surrounding Bitcoin. While it remains highly unlikely, an “extremely dovish stance” from the Federal Reserve and Chairman Jerome Powell could provide the necessary momentum for BTC to rise even further. At the time of writing, BTC is trading at $104,140, down 2.6% on the 24-hour time frame but still up 6.5% on the week.

37793266,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=629500,1734514279,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/37793266.jpeg,Should president Trump ban US Congress members from crypto trading just like with stocks?,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/should-trump-ban-us-congress-members-crypto/,"Self-proclaimed ‘crypto president’ Donal Trump faces a new ethical crossroads: Should he block U.S. Congress members from trading cryptos, mirroring the proposed ban on stocks, which he supports? With the crypto market becoming a multi-trillion-dollar industry, allowing lawmakers to trade in it could look like handing the keys to the vault to the people writing the rules. Banning Congress from trading stocks has been a hot topic for a while now. Sitting president Joe Biden threw his support behind it ages ago, saying lawmakers shouldn’t profit from markets they have the power to influence. Polls show 75% of Americans agree. But crypto, which is decentralized, global, and volatile, presents an entirely different beast. It’s never been done before. There are no existing patterns to follow, and Mr. Trump is not the most responsible person on the planet. Trump’s crypto love affair Trump is Bitcoin’s loudest advocate in Washington right now. He’s backed policies like halting government bitcoin sales and appointing crypto allies to powerful regulatory posts. His approach to crypto has made him wildly popular among us blockchain enthusiasts, but it has also raised questions about his own investments. Trump’s personal crypto holdings and ties to industry players could muddy the waters when it comes to enforcing ethical standards. Richard Painter, a former White House ethics lawyer, has shared that he’s worried Trump’s financial interests could influence the decisions he makes—or doesn’t make—on regulating cryptocurrencies. “The conflicts have substantially increased alongside the expansion of his business empire,” he said. And let’s be honest, a crypto-friendly SEC chief under Trump could be great for the market but questionable for governance. Columbia Law School professor John Coffee took it a step further, pointing out how Trump’s administration would mean lighter enforcement on crypto companies . While that might sound like music to the ears of Bitcoin bulls, it’s a problem when lawmakers stand to profit personally from the rules they create. The legislative battle over Congress’s trades The idea of banning Congress from trading anything isn’t new. The ETHICS Act, introduced years ago, sought to stop lawmakers and their families from profiting in markets they influence. As of press time, Congress members can still trade stock freely, despite the growing public demand for change. The ETHICS Act could extend to cryptocurrencies, but it’s still a proposal, not a law. Even if it passes, enforcing it would be another uphill battle. Crypto moves fast, much faster than Washington. And unlike stocks , it’s not tied to a central exchange. Banning it could be a massive disaster, but allowing it could be worse. Polls show the public is tired of lawmakers profiting while supposedly serving the people. Ethical governance is the buzzword, but applying it to a decentralized market like crypto is a whole different game. One misstep, and the public’s fragile trust in Congress could crumble further. Wonder what that’ll do to Trump’s legacy. What other countries are doing The U.S. isn’t the only one grappling with these questions. In the UK, lawmakers have to show all their financial interests, including stocks and cryptos. Canada’s Conflict of Interest Act does the same, making sure there is tight transparency in public office. Australia too. Lawmakers must disclose their crypto holdings to avoid potential scandals. Germany offers lawmakers more leeway but is facing calls to tighten its rules. And in the European Union, transparency and ethical investment policies are top priorities. Compared to these places, the U.S. looks like the Wild West, with rules that are vague and barely enforced. Crypto is still new, and lawmakers who own it might better understand its complexities. That could help them draft smarter, fairer regulations. But crypto is supposed to represent financial freedom. Restricting it could send the wrong message about the industry. There’s also the argument about attracting talent to public service. If financial restrictions are too harsh, qualified individuals might avoid politics altogether. Though let’s just face it: Trump’s probably not gonna ban Congress from either stock or crypto trading. He loves making money far too much for that.",OP-ED|BTC|SEC|USD,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|REGULATION|TRADING,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2024-12-18 09:31:19

Why $PHNIX Could Be the Next $PEPE, $WIF, or $SHIB",https://thecoinrise.com/phnix-the-next-big-meme-coin-on-the-xrp-ledger-why-phnix-could-be-the-next-pepe-wif-or-shib/,"In the dynamic world of cryptocurrencies, meme coins have carved out a unique niche, capturing the imagination of investors and enthusiasts alike. Tokens like PEPE, WIF, and SHIB have demonstrated the power of community-driven projects to achieve exponential growth. Now, a new contender has emerged on the XRP Ledger (XRPL): $PHNIX . Launched on December 3, 2024, $PHNIX has quickly gained traction, positioning itself as a symbol of resilience and rebirth within the XRP community. The Symbolism Behind $PHNIX The phoenix, a mythical bird that rises from its ashes, has long been associated with themes of renewal and indestructibility. Within the XRP community, this symbolism resonates deeply, especially in light of challenges such as the SEC lawsuit that once cast doubt on XRP’s future. However, XRP’s resurgence has mirrored the phoenix’s legendary rebirth, inspiring the creation of $PHNIX as a tribute to this enduring spirit. As stated on their official website, “$PHNIX is here to be the ultimate symbol of the resilience of XRP in the face of adversity.” Why $PHNIX Could Be the Next PEPE, WIF, or SHIB 1. Strong Community Engagement : Meme coins thrive on active and passionate communities. $PHNIX has rapidly cultivated a dedicated following, with enthusiasts rallying around its symbolic representation of XRP’s resilience. The project’s emphasis on community involvement is evident through initiatives like encouraging supporters to add $PHNIX-themed sunglasses to their profile pictures, fostering a sense of unity and shared purpose. 2. Strategic Marketing and Partnerships : The $PHNIX team has outlined plans for extensive marketing campaigns, including collaborations with Key Opinion Leaders (KOLs) and traditional marketing avenues, to amplify the token’s reach. Additionally, efforts are underway to secure listings on centralized exchanges (CEX) and form strategic partnerships, further enhancing $PHNIX’s visibility and accessibility. 3. Alignment with XRP’s Narrative : By embodying the phoenix, $PHNIX taps into a narrative that is already deeply ingrained within the XRP community. This alignment not only attracts existing XRP supporters but also appeals to new investors drawn to the compelling story of resilience and rebirth. As noted in a recent press release, “$PHNIX builds on this symbolism, serving as a memecoin that embodies the widely recognized mascot of XRP.” 4. Utilizing the XRPL Ecosystem : Operating on the XRP Ledger offers $PHNIX several advantages, including fast transaction speeds and low fees. These features make it more appealing for traders and investors, facilitating seamless transactions and fostering increased adoption. The token is available on FirstLedger, a decentralized exchange on the XRPL network, with no transaction taxes, ensuring a user-friendly trading experience. Recent Performance and Growth Since its launch, $PHNIX has demonstrated impressive growth. Within days, its market capitalization soared, capturing the attention of the crypto community. This rapid ascent mirrors the early trajectories of other successful meme coins, suggesting that $PHNIX could follow a similar path to prominence. As reported by CryptoPotato, $PHNIX has experienced significant price appreciation, indicating strong market interest. Conclusion While the cryptocurrency market is inherently volatile and investing in meme coins carries significant risk, $PHNIX presents a compelling case for potential growth. Its deep-rooted symbolism, strategic marketing efforts, and alignment with the resilient spirit of XRP position it as a strong contender to become the next major meme coin on the XRP Ledger. As always, potential investors should conduct thorough research and consider their risk tolerance before making investment decisions.

This move comes as part of Binance’s regular reviews to ensure listed tokens meet its high standards. However, the delisting has led to a sharp price drop of 20% to 40% for these coins. Why Are These Tokens Being Delisted? Binance cited various factors behind the delisting decision. The platform conducts regular reviews to ensure listed assets meet high standards, considering factors like development activity, trading volume, network stability, and regulatory compliance. After a thorough evaluation, WRX, AKRO, and BLZ were found not to align with these criteria. This decision highlights Binance’s commitment to protecting users and maintaining a sustainable crypto ecosystem. Key Dates to Keep in Mind The delisting process begins with the removal of all trading pairs; Trading Pairs Removal: Trading for WRX/USDT, AKRO/USDT, BLZ/BTC, and BLZ/USDT, will delist on December 25, 2024, at 03:00 (UTC). Deposits and Withdrawals: Deposits of these tokens will no longer be credited after December 26, 2024, at 03:00 (UTC). Withdrawals will be supported only until February 25, 2025, at 03:00 (UTC). For futures traders, Binance will settle and close all BLZUSDT contracts on December 23, 2024. Meanwhile, services like Binance Margin, Auto-Invest, and Gift Cards will gradually phase out support for these tokens in the coming weeks. WRX, AKRO, BLZ, Recorded Massive Drop Following Binance’s announcement to delist these tokens, their prices experienced a sharp decline. India’s leading crypto exchange token, WazirX (WRX) , dropped by 40% in just a few hours, now trading around $0.15. Similarly, Kaon (formerly Akropolis), represented by AKRO, also faced a steep fall, plunging by 25% followed by the BLZ token recording a drop of 24% now trading around $0.10.

The achievement has reignited discussions related to the future potential of Bitcoin. As the cryptocurrency world awaits the launch of a Bitcoin Reserve in the United States under Donald Trump, who is set to take oath as the president on January 25, 2025, a crypto enthusiast, identified as Atlas on X, predicts that the move could push the price of Bitcoin to as high as $1M. Yes! You have heard it right. One Million Per A Bitcoin! Is it possible? Let’s listen to what Atlas has to say. Ready? Trump’s Bitcoin Reserve Plan Cryptocurrency emerged as a key topic during the US political campaign. Both Donald Trump and Kamala Harris presented many revolutionary proposals for the industry. Trump’s proposal for a US Bitcoin reserve gained immense popularity, as it presented primarily as a strategy to shield the US economy from the threat of inflation. Atlas states that the Tump-led US government would buy at least 20% of the total supply of Bitcoin. ➠ 2 ◈ Trump’s election campaign popularized the notion of a $BTC reserve, pitching it as a future-focused economic solution ◈ Critics were quick to condemn the plan, citing Bitcoin’s volatility as a major issue ◈ Many argued it would create more problems than benefits for… — Atlas (@crptAtlas) December 17, 2024 Bitcoin Reserve: Benefits and Criticism From its initial presentation, the BTC reserve plan attracted severe criticism. Almost all the arguments against the proposal hinge on the fact that Bitcoin is highly volatile in nature. Most critics believe that it is unwise to use a highly volatile asset as a reserve and it will push the US economy to a disaster. Supporters See Long-Term Benefits Those advocating for the proposal highlight the fact that Bitcoin has the capacity to act as a hedge against economic risks. In the last one year, Bitcoin has seen a growth of 152.7%, reinforcing its value as a strategic asset for financial stability. Global Context: Why Bitcoin is Crucial Undisputedly, Russia sees embracing Bitcoin as a strategy to overcome the sanctions imposed against the country by the western power in response to its aggressive military action against Ukraine. Atlas notes that at least $300 billion of Russian assets were freezed by the western power using the economic sanction. Bitcoin as a Strategic Asset Definitely, countries, unhappily with the way the US dominates the global economy using the US dollar, like China, will accept any sensible strategy that can help them reduce their reliance on the US dollar. Atlas opines that nations like Russia and China are eager to embrace strategies to help them rescue their reliance on the US dollar. Bitcoin’s Price and Adoption Potential Right now, the US has no choice but to embrace Bitcoin. It is important to grab the early-mover advantage to establish the country’s dominance in the Bitcoin market. This indicates that it is highly likely for the US to acquire 20% of the BTC supply. Atlas forecasts that if the US adopts Bitcoin, it could push the price to as high as $1,000,000. It’s pure economics. Reducing supply and increasing demand are the ideal conditions for price growth. In conclusion, the US Bitcoin Reserve could revolutionise the global financial system. With rising demand, reduced supply, and global competition, BTC’s future looks promising.

Meanwhile, these levels favour both the bulls and the bears at frequent intervals, suggesting a particular pattern being formed within the markets. The bull remains vigilant over the price trends of the cryptos and, after a brief consolidation, triggers a strong rise towards the higher resistance. Meanwhile, the emergence of the primitive tokens that have experienced multiple bull & bear markets has raised the speculation of traders shifting their focus back to the fundamentals more than the trend. Hedera (HBAR) Price Eyes At a New ATH at $1 Hedera price triggered a massive upswing after rebounding from the November lows; HBAR price surged and achieved levels not seen since December 2021. With this recovery, the market participants became confident of the upcoming price action as the platform witnessed a huge influx of buying volume that it had never witnessed ever in history. This seems to have triggered a strong bullish case for the HBAR price, which is believed to mark new highs before the end of the year and eventually reach $1 or levels just above, marking the peak for the ongoing bull run. The latest integration of Hedera & Chainlink seems to have fueled the rally, which is about to enter a fresh bullish range. The price is stuck between 0.786 & 1 FIB levels between $0.44 and $0.571. As the RSI has displayed a bearish divergence from the overbought zone, a small pullback in the price is expected, which has begun and reached levels below $0.25. However, if the RSI hovers within the upper zone, the bullish momentum could be held, which may revamp a strong rise towards the ATH at $0.571 before the end of the year. Uniswap (UNI) Price Aims for a 100% Rise Soon The top DeFi token, Uniswap, has been largely volatile since the start of the year and experienced over 220% rise followed by 13% retracement. The price failed to clear one of the pivotal resistance zones between $18.9 and $19.6, the neckline of the parabolic recovery. However, the UNI price is expected to face an extended pullback and eventually trigger a strong rebound in no time. The UNI price is currently facing extreme bearish pressure for the second consecutive week, which suggests it may maintain a strong descending trend until the end. The OBV has displayed a bearish divergence but may certainly not validate a momental shift from the ongoing bullish trend. The token is experiencing a rise in volumes after a long time and with the first weekly Golden Cross, the price is expected to get a larger boost and trigger a 100% rise, reaching levels above $24.",Price Analysis|Altcoins,EN,0,0,ALTCOIN|MARKET|TRADING|UNI|HBAR,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2024-12-18 09:49:56

Republican Representative Derek Merrin spearheaded this initiative, adding Ohio to the growing list of states considering Bitcoin as part of their financial strategy. This move follows a similar bill introduced in Texas by Representative Giovanni Capriglione, highlighting a broader trend of state governments exploring Bitcoin adoption. What Is a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve? A strategic Bitcoin reserve involves a state or entity holding a portion of its financial assets in Bitcoin. The rationale is to leverage Bitcoin’s potential as a hedge against inflation, diversify reserves, and embrace the technological advancements driving the digital economy. For states like Ohio, creating a Bitcoin reserve signals a commitment to innovation and positions them as leaders in cryptocurrency adoption. Details of Ohio’s Bitcoin Reserve Bill Key Provisions Proposed by: Ohio Republican Representative Derek Merrin. Goal: Establish a state-owned Bitcoin reserve to diversify Ohio’s financial assets. Potential Uses: Hedge against inflation. Support technological innovation within the state. Attract blockchain and crypto-related businesses to Ohio. Timeline and Implementation While specific timelines for the bill’s passage and implementation remain unclear, its introduction marks a significant step toward integrating cryptocurrency into state-level financial strategies. Texas Leads the Way in Bitcoin Reserves The Texas Bill Just days before Ohio’s announcement, Texas Representative Giovanni Capriglione introduced a similar bill. Texas has long been a hub for cryptocurrency mining and innovation, and a Bitcoin reserve could further solidify its status as a crypto-friendly state. Lessons for Ohio Ohio can look to Texas for guidance in implementing a strategic Bitcoin reserve, including: Legal frameworks for procurement and storage. Collaboration with blockchain experts. Educating the public on the benefits and risks of cryptocurrency reserves. Why Are States Considering Bitcoin Reserves? 1. Hedge Against Inflation Bitcoin’s fixed supply of 21 million coins makes it a potential hedge against inflation, unlike fiat currencies, which can be printed in unlimited amounts. 2. Economic Diversification State-owned Bitcoin reserves diversify financial portfolios, reducing reliance on traditional assets like bonds and equities. 3. Encouraging Innovation Adopting Bitcoin can position states as leaders in technological innovation, attracting blockchain startups and investment. 4. Preparing for a Digital Future As cryptocurrencies gain mainstream acceptance, states with Bitcoin reserves will be better equipped to navigate the evolving financial landscape. Challenges in Establishing a Bitcoin Reserve While the concept of a strategic Bitcoin reserve is promising, there are significant challenges: 1. Regulatory Hurdles Cryptocurrency regulation in the U.S. remains complex, with varying rules at the state and federal levels. States like Ohio must navigate these regulations to ensure compliance. 2. Volatility Risks Bitcoin’s price volatility poses a risk to state finances. Effective risk management strategies will be crucial for maintaining financial stability. 3. Public Perception Educating residents about the benefits and risks of a Bitcoin reserve will be essential to gain public support. 4. Security Concerns Ensuring the safety of state-owned Bitcoin reserves will require robust cybersecurity measures to prevent theft and hacking. Economic Implications for Ohio Boosting Blockchain Adoption Creating a Bitcoin reserve could attract blockchain startups and investors, fostering economic growth and job creation in Ohio. Increasing Revenue Streams If Bitcoin’s value continues to rise, Ohio’s Bitcoin reserve could generate significant returns, benefiting the state budget. Enhancing State Reputation By embracing cryptocurrency, Ohio positions itself as a forward-thinking state, encouraging innovation and technological advancement. Global Trends in Bitcoin Reserves Nation-State Adoption Countries like El Salvador have already adopted Bitcoin as legal tender and maintain national Bitcoin reserves. Ohio’s move aligns with this global trend, albeit at the state level. Institutional Adoption Major corporations like MicroStrategy and Tesla have invested heavily in Bitcoin, showcasing its potential as a strategic asset. What’s Next for Ohio? 1. Legislative Process Ohio lawmakers will debate and refine the bill before it can be passed into law. Public hearings and expert consultations are expected. 2. Collaboration with Industry Experts Partnering with blockchain and cryptocurrency experts will be crucial for implementing the reserve effectively. 3. Addressing Public Concerns Ohio must address questions around Bitcoin’s volatility, environmental impact, and long-term viability to gain public trust. Conclusion: A Bold Step Toward the Future Ohio’s introduction of a Bitcoin strategic reserve bill marks a pivotal moment in cryptocurrency adoption at the state level. While challenges remain, the potential benefits—including economic diversification, technological innovation, and financial stability—make this a compelling initiative. As more states follow suit, Bitcoin’s role in public finance could reshape the future of government asset management. For Ohio, this bold step positions the state as a leader in embracing the digital economy.

37793594,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=111284,1734515496,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Crypto Fear & Greed Index Drops to 81: Market Still in ‘Extreme Greed’ Zone,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/crypto-fear-greed-index-falls-to-81/,"Understanding the Crypto Fear & Greed Index The Crypto Fear & Greed Index , a popular tool for gauging investor sentiment in the cryptocurrency market, fell to 81 on December 18, 2024, dropping six points from the previous day. Despite the decline, the market remains firmly in the “Extreme Greed” zone, indicating continued bullish sentiment among traders and investors. This index, provided by Alternative, serves as a thermometer for the emotional state of the crypto market. A score of 0 reflects “Extreme Fear,” while 100 represents “Extreme Greed.” Understanding how this index works and what it signals can help traders and investors make more informed decisions. What Is the Crypto Fear & Greed Index? The Crypto Fear & Greed Index aggregates data from multiple sources to measure market sentiment, assigning a single score between 0 and 100. It provides insights into whether the market is leaning toward fear , signaling potential undervaluation, or greed , indicating overvaluation. Factors Influencing the Index The index considers six key metrics: Volatility (25%) : Examines market fluctuations over time. Market Momentum/Volume (25%) : Assesses trading activity and price movement. Social Media (15%) : Analyzes sentiment from platforms like Twitter and Reddit. Surveys (15%) : Collects opinions from the crypto community. Bitcoin Dominance (10%) : Tracks Bitcoin’s market share relative to altcoins. Google Trends (10%) : Monitors search interest in cryptocurrency-related terms. The Significance of a Score of 81 With the index at 81 , the market is clearly in the “Extreme Greed” zone. Here’s what this means: 1. High Bullish Sentiment Investors and traders are optimistic, driving prices higher across the cryptocurrency market. Such sentiment often corresponds with new entrants into the market and increased trading activity. 2. Risk of Overvaluation “Extreme Greed” can signal a potential market bubble. Overvaluation may lead to sharp corrections, especially if sentiment shifts due to negative news or profit-taking. 3. Momentum for Altcoins During periods of extreme greed, altcoins often see increased attention and price gains as traders seek higher returns beyond Bitcoin. Implications of the Recent Drop The six-point drop in the index could suggest: 1. Cooling Market Sentiment The slight decline may indicate a pause in market euphoria, potentially leading to short-term consolidation or a minor pullback in prices. 2. Healthy Correction A reduction in extreme greed can be seen as a healthy correction, offering a more sustainable path for the market to grow without overheating. 3. External Factors Macro events, regulatory news, or changes in global markets may have contributed to the slight decline in sentiment. How to Use the Crypto Fear & Greed Index for Trading 1. Identifying Market Trends Extreme Fear (0-24): Indicates undervalued conditions, potentially signaling buying opportunities. Fear (25-49): Suggests caution but may still present opportunities for long-term investors. Neutral (50): Balanced market conditions. Greed (51-74): Bullish sentiment with potential for short-term gains. Extreme Greed (75-100): Overvalued market, where caution is advised. 2. Timing Entries and Exits During extreme greed, traders might consider taking profits or setting stop-loss orders to manage risks. During extreme fear, dollar-cost averaging or opening new positions could yield long-term gains. 3. Complementary Indicators Use the index alongside other tools like RSI (Relative Strength Index), MACD (Moving Average Convergence Divergence), and support/resistance levels for a comprehensive strategy. Key Trends in Crypto Sentiment Bitcoin’s Dominance Bitcoin’s performance often sets the tone for the entire market. Currently, its dominance is contributing to the overall “Extreme Greed” sentiment. Altcoin Activity With Bitcoin leading the charge, altcoins like Ethereum, Solana, and Polygon often follow suit, experiencing heightened trading activity. Market Volatility Periods of extreme greed often correlate with increased volatility, creating both opportunities and risks for traders. The Role of Social Media and Google Trends Social Media Influence Crypto discussions on platforms like Twitter and Reddit significantly impact market sentiment. Positive news or celebrity endorsements can drive the index higher, while FUD (fear, uncertainty, doubt) can push it lower. Google Trends Search interest in terms like “buy Bitcoin” or “crypto bull run” offers a glimpse into retail investor behavior. An uptick in search trends often coincides with higher index scores. What’s Next for the Market? 1. Continued Monitoring of the Index Investors should keep an eye on the index to anticipate potential market reversals. A drop below 75 could signal the start of a more cautious phase. 2. Focus on Key Market Drivers Institutional Activity: Moves by large investors can significantly influence sentiment. Regulatory News: Developments in crypto regulations can sway the index in either direction. Macro Trends: Global economic conditions, such as inflation rates and currency stability, also play a role. 3. Opportunities in Altcoins As the market remains in Altcoin Season, traders may find opportunities in undervalued projects or emerging technologies. Conclusion: Navigating Extreme Greed The Crypto Fear & Greed Index at 81 highlights the market’s strong bullish sentiment, but the slight decline suggests a possible moderation in euphoria.

Holding an impressive 439,000 BTC , MicroStrategy has leveraged the cryptocurrency’s upward momentum to boost its market cap to $99.4 billion , positioning itself to outpace global brands like Starbucks and Nike if Bitcoin continues its bullish trend. In this article, we explore how MicroStrategy’s strategic investment in Bitcoin is reshaping the financial landscape, examine its potential to surpass industry giants, and assess the risks and rewards associated with its bold approach. MicroStrategy and Bitcoin: An Unbreakable Bond MicroStrategy, a business intelligence and software solutions company, took a transformative turn in 2020 when CEO Michael Saylor announced the company’s pivot toward Bitcoin as a primary treasury reserve asset. This decision was rooted in Saylor’s belief in Bitcoin as “digital gold” and a hedge against inflation. Since then, MicroStrategy has accumulated 439,000 BTC , making it the largest corporate holder of Bitcoin globally. The company’s strategy has not only reshaped its financial outlook but also sparked a wave of Bitcoin adoption among institutional investors. The Numbers Behind MicroStrategy’s Success MicroStrategy’s market cap growth is closely tied to Bitcoin’s price movements. The company gains approximately $440 million for every $1,000 increase in Bitcoin’s price , a testament to the outsized impact of its cryptocurrency holdings. Milestone Projections According to Cointelegraph , MicroStrategy could soon surpass major global brands if Bitcoin reaches the following price points: Bitcoin Price Market Cap Brand Comparison $118,810 $105.5 billion Surpasses Starbucks ($105.5B) $140,000 $115 billion Surpasses Nike ($115B) This ambitious projection highlights the potential of MicroStrategy’s Bitcoin-centric strategy, as it capitalizes on the cryptocurrency’s increasing adoption and value. Why MicroStrategy’s Bitcoin Bet Matters MicroStrategy’s decision to double down on Bitcoin has significant implications for both the cryptocurrency market and the corporate world. Pioneering Institutional Adoption By incorporating Bitcoin into its corporate strategy, MicroStrategy has set a precedent for other companies. It has demonstrated that Bitcoin can serve as a legitimate reserve asset and a tool for value preservation in uncertain economic times. Market Leadership in Cryptocurrency Holdings With its massive Bitcoin holdings, MicroStrategy has positioned itself as a leader in the crypto space. Its success has encouraged other corporations, such as Tesla and Square, to explore Bitcoin investments. Strengthened Brand Identity MicroStrategy’s alignment with Bitcoin has boosted its visibility and appeal, especially among cryptocurrency enthusiasts and investors. This association has further solidified its image as an innovative and forward-thinking company. The Debt-Fueled Strategy: A Double-Edged Sword While MicroStrategy’s Bitcoin strategy has delivered substantial gains, it has also attracted scrutiny due to its reliance on debt to fund cryptocurrency purchases. The company currently holds $7 billion in debt , compared to its $47 billion in Bitcoin holdings . Supporters’ Perspective Proponents argue that MicroStrategy’s long-term Bitcoin investment outweighs its debt obligations. As Bitcoin’s value appreciates, the company’s holdings could generate exponential returns, offsetting any financial liabilities. Critics’ Concerns Market Volatility : Bitcoin’s price is highly volatile, and a significant downturn could expose MicroStrategy to substantial financial risks. Debt Repayment : Critics warn that a prolonged bear market could make it challenging for the company to service its debt, especially if its stock price declines. Stock Premium Debate : Some analysts, such as Clifford Asness of AQR Capital, have questioned the sustainability of MicroStrategy’s trading premium, suggesting that new share buyers may be enriching existing shareholders at their own expense. Bitcoin’s Role in MicroStrategy’s Growth Bitcoin has been the driving force behind MicroStrategy’s growth, providing a significant boost to its market cap and stock price. However, the cryptocurrency’s performance also introduces an element of uncertainty. Bullish Momentum Bitcoin’s recent rally has been fueled by growing institutional interest, increased adoption, and macroeconomic factors such as inflation concerns. This upward trajectory has been a boon for MicroStrategy, solidifying its position as a market leader. Potential Downside If Bitcoin experiences a significant price correction, MicroStrategy’s stock could face downward pressure. The company’s financial health is intrinsically linked to Bitcoin’s market performance, making it vulnerable to crypto market fluctuations. MicroStrategy’s Vision for the Future Despite the inherent risks, MicroStrategy remains committed to its Bitcoin strategy. CEO Michael Saylor has consistently expressed confidence in the cryptocurrency’s long-term potential, positioning it as a cornerstone of the company’s financial strategy. Expanding Bitcoin Adoption MicroStrategy’s success has inspired other corporations to explore Bitcoin as a reserve asset, contributing to the cryptocurrency’s growing adoption. This trend underscores Bitcoin’s potential to become a mainstream financial instrument. Pioneering Innovation By integrating Bitcoin into its corporate strategy, MicroStrategy has positioned itself as a pioneer in the intersection of technology and finance. This forward-thinking approach aligns with the company’s mission to drive innovation and create value for its stakeholders. Key Takeaways for Investors MicroStrategy’s bold approach to Bitcoin investment offers valuable insights for investors: Diversification : The company’s strategy highlights the importance of diversification and innovation in portfolio management. Risk Management : Investors should be mindful of the risks associated with market volatility and debt obligations. Long-Term Vision : MicroStrategy’s commitment to Bitcoin underscores the importance of adopting a long-term perspective in investment strategies. Conclusion: A Bold Gamble with Promising Prospects MicroStrategy’s journey with Bitcoin is a testament to the transformative potential of cryptocurrency in the corporate world. While the company’s debt-fueled strategy has drawn criticism, its massive Bitcoin holdings position it for unprecedented growth if the cryptocurrency’s value continues to rise. As MicroStrategy inches closer to surpassing global brands like Starbucks and Nike, its success serves as both an inspiration and a cautionary tale for other corporations. The company’s bold bet on Bitcoin highlights the opportunities and challenges of embracing cryptocurrency in an ever-evolving financial landscape. Whether MicroStrategy’s strategy will yield long-term success or expose it to significant financial risks remains to be seen. For now, the company’s commitment to Bitcoin has solidified its place as a trailblazer in the intersection of technology, finance, and innovation.",Crypto News|BITCOIN|Microstrategy|Starbucks,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|FIAT|MARKET|TRADING,"{'name': 'Bitcoin World', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinworld,2024-12-18 09:52:39

Named Project Dama 2, this initiative is part of the Monetary Authority of Singapore’s (MAS) Project Guardian and involves major financial institutions exploring blockchain technology for asset tokenization. This innovative L2 protocol enhances public blockchains like Ethereum, focusing on cost efficiency, security, and regulatory compliance. By leveraging curated validators that meet strict compliance standards, Deutsche Bank’s solution ensures safer interactions, reducing risks such as inadvertently engaging with sanctioned entities or unverified validators. The protocol also incorporates advanced features like ZKsync technology, which boosts transaction speed and security. One standout feature is the introduction of ""super admin rights"" for regulators , granting oversight authorities the ability to monitor transactions transparently when necessary. This approach balances blockchain’s benefits, such as scalability and interoperability, with stringent regulatory requirements, offering a more secure and efficient framework for financial institutions. Public blockchains like Ethereum have the potential to revolutionize finance, particularly through asset tokenization. However, traditional financial institutions have hesitated to adopt them due to compliance concerns. Risks include vulnerabilities to unexpected events, like hard forks, which can disrupt digital ledgers. Deutsche Bank's Layer-2 framework addresses these challenges while maintaining a detailed transaction record separate from the underlying Layer-1 blockchain. Project Dama 2, developed with crypto firms Memento Blockchain Pte. and Interop Labs, aims to bridge TradFi and decentralized systems. It offers a tailored approach to compliance while taking advantage of blockchain's scalability and cost-saving potential. According to Boon-Hiong Chan, Deutsche Bank’s Asia-Pacific innovation lead, public blockchains can offer unmatched benefits if compliance risks are effectively managed. By connecting to Ethereum, the solution highlights the possibilities of integrating decentralized technology with traditional financial systems. This development underscores the importance of collaboration in advancing blockchain innovation . The project reflects a strategic move toward combining TradFi's regulatory rigor with the efficiency of decentralized systems. If approved by regulators , Deutsche Bank plans to launch a minimum viable product (MVP) for Dama 2 next year. This pilot could serve as a model for other financial institutions navigating similar challenges, potentially setting new standards for compliance and innovation in the financial sector.",,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|ETH|FIAT|TECHNOLOGY|FORKS,"{'name': 'Coinpaprika', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/80/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaprika,2024-12-18 09:54:31
37793754,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=629523,1734515732,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/37793754.jpeg,US DOJ to call Perplexity executive to testify against Google in the antitrust case,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/doj-calls-perplexity-testify-against-google/,"Following Google’s appeal regarding the antitrust case, the Department of Justice (DOJ) seeks to summon particular witnesses. Dmitry Shevelenko, the chief business officer of Perplexity, has been called upon to testify against Google, a direct competitor in the tech arena. According to reports , Dmitry Shevelenko is to be interviewed by the DOJ regarding the relationship between generative AI and Search Access Points, distribution, barriers to entry and expansion, and data sharing. DOJ believes the information might strengthen its argument that Google monopolizes the search business and excludes potential competitors and, as a result, deserves more severe penalties. The link between Perplexity and Google Perplexity and other generative AI tools, such as OpenAI’ s ChatGPT Search, have emerged as a potential alternative to internet searches. These tools can provide direct responses to complex inquiries, even when faced with inaccurate or made-up information. Google, however, saw it as a challenge and responded by developing its own AI search tools, including AI Overviews, which display AI-generated responses above search results. Recently, Aravind Srinivas, the CEO of Perplexity AI expressed his desire to form a partnership with news publishers who have accused the Google challenger of stealing their workstream. He attacked Google’s business model of directing consumers to websites while making money from advertisements or sponsored results. Aravind Srinivas stated, “We certainly were very surprised about the lawsuit because we actually wanted a conversation.” This shows that Perplexity has shown interest in going against Google. This must be the reason why DOJ knows they will cooperate. What is the weight of Perplexity’s testimony? In October, Google served a summons on Perplexity to obtain company documents to substantiate its case that it has a viable competitor in the search industry. However, Google lamented in a court filing that it had not received “a single document” from Perplexity as of December 11. The company contends that after two months of waiting, there is “no conceivable justification for further delay.” According to the filling, Perplexity has already consented to fulfill 12 of Google’s 14 document requests. Still, it claims that it is continuing to assess the burden associated with the collection of such a potentially extensive universe of documents. Perplexity further states that it has agreed to submit copies of licensing agreements related to AI training. But Google wants all of Perplexity’s licensing agreements and has urged Google to “meet and confer” on this matter. The antitrust case The antitrust case was started by the DOJ in 2020 and was joined by more than 30 state attorneys general. The case stated that Google has unfair control over the internet search market. It claimed that Google was breaking the law to stop competing search engines like Bing and DuckDuckGo from doing business. Source: Cloudflare Cloudflare report analysis also showed the extent of Google’s monopoly to be 88.5%. In particular, Google made deals with big companies like internet browsers and smartphone makers like Apple and Android to be the default search engine on their products. This pushed rivals out of the market and stopped them from growing. Ted Sfikas, field chief technology officer at Amplitude explained, “Google’s Search market is so dominant and it is inextricably tied to Google Chrome, Google Ad Network, Google Ads Hub, Google Analytics, and Google Tag Manager, they are demonstrating monopoly power when they cause harm to the market.” Source: Cloudflare According to Cloudflare, Chrome led by 65.8%, which is also part of Google. Judge Amit Mehta agreed with the DOJ that Google acted as a monopolist in the internet search space by barring competitors. This created a feedback loop between monopolization and increased ad revenue, which allowed the company to raise digital ad prices and further dominate the market. According to the verdict, Google has an 89.2% share of the general search market, which rises to 94.9% on mobile devices. However, Google announced its intention to appeal the ruling, alleging that it would restrict consumers’ access to their preferred search engine .

With the heavy liquidation of long traders, amounting to over $333 million in the past 24 hours, the flagship coin is likely to continue consolidating to pave the way for more bullish sentiment ahead. With 2024 remaining less than two weeks to come to an end, more whale investors have been betting on more uptrends. Moreover, Bitcoin’s open internet (OI) has continued to rise exponentially to a new all-time high of above $68 billion.

Later today, the Federal Reserve will release its final FOMC data for 2024, with analysts forecasting a 25 basis point cut to 4.50 percent amid the cooling down of inflation. On Thursday, the Bank of Japan (BoJ) will review its monetary policies including its benchmark interest rate, with analysts predicting a hold at 0.25 percent. Later on Thursday, the Bank of England (BoE) will release its lending rate, with experts forecasting a hold at 4.75 percent. What Next? According to crypto analyst Ali Martinez, Bitcoin traders and holders should brace themselves for a rougher ride as the flagship coin enters the parabolic phase of the bull market. The crypto analyst compared the 2024/2025 Bitcoin rally to the 2017 and 2020/2021, but with more bullish sentiment. In this regard, the crypto analyst expects Bitcoin price to experience a brief correction after reaching $110k, a steeper correction after hitting $125k, a bigger correction after hitting $150k, and the bull run to end after hitting $220k later in 2025.",News|Bitcoin|Price Analysis,EN,0,0,ALTCOIN|ASIA|BTC|FIAT|TRADING,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2024-12-18 09:55:46

These fake emails, crafted to appear legitimate, urge users to verify their recovery phrases on a fraudulent website, granting attackers full access to victims’ cryptocurrency wallets. The surge in holiday transactions adds urgency to the ongoing threat of crypto scams. The phishing campaign, detailed by tech news outlet Bleeping Computer, begins with deceptive emails titled “Security Alert: Data Breach May Expose Your Recovery Phrase.” These emails claim that a recent Ledger data breach may have put users’ recovery phrases at risk and direct recipients to a fake Ledger-branded website. Hosted on Amazon Web Services, the site appears professional and mimics Ledger’s legitimate platform. Users are prompted to conduct a ""security check"" by entering their recovery phrases, which are then validated against a recognized word list. Regardless of input, the site falsely claims phrases are invalid, encouraging users to try again, ensuring scammers obtain accurate information. Once attackers have the recovery phrases, they can take full control of wallets, draining funds and seizing other digital assets. This scam highlights the dangers of phishing during the holiday season, a time when online activity spikes, and vigilance is often lowered. Ledger has not confirmed a new data breach but reminded users of its long-standing policy: “Ledger will never ask for your 24-word recovery phrase. If someone does, it’s a scam.” The company has faced phishing issues before, especially after a 2020 breach that exposed customer information, leading to targeted phishing campaigns. Another incident in December 2023 saw Ledger’s connector library exploited, resulting in nearly $500,000 in losses. These recurring events have eroded trust among some users, with one remarking, “For a company we trust to safeguard our assets, this is not reassuring.” Crypto fraud has fluctuated recently, with phishing-related losses dropping by 53% in November 2024 to $9.3 million. However, this latest attack suggests scammers are refining their tactics. Security experts warn that crypto investors must remain cautious and take proactive measures to protect their wallets, especially during high-risk periods like the holidays. Ultimately, safeguarding digital assets is the individual’s responsibility.",,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|WALLET,"{'name': 'Coinpaprika', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/80/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaprika,2024-12-18 09:59:36

One of the major factors has been the approval of ETFs. This caused the price to go higher and encouraged institutional adoption. Read on as we’ll explain how Bitcoin ETFs have influenced the crypto bull market and the wider implications for the cryptocurrency ecosystem. What are Bitcoin ETFs? A Bitcoin ETF allows you to invest without the actual ownership of Bitcoin. It is traded on traditional stock exchanges. You will be able to buy shares in an ETF as you would with any stock, instead of in crypto wallets or exchanges. Most ETFs track the underlying price performance of Bitcoin either by holding the cryptocurrency outright or by utilizing futures contracts. The setup therefore provides a way for investors to benefit in the rises in the price of Bitcoin without ownership challenges. Why Bitcoin ETFs Matter Approval of Bitcoin ETF certainly shifted the dynamics of the cryptocurrency market. This is revolutionary for many reasons: Accessibility: More individuals can now invest in Bitcoin thanks to Bitcoin ETFs, which make it quite simple. Credibility: In the view of more conventional investors, Bitcoin has a lot of validity because ETFs have received regulatory approval. Institutional Adoption: Big institutions can invest in Bitcoin through regulated ETFs. Liquidity: ETFs provide liquidity as more players join the market, which improves the efficiency of Bitcoin trading. Price Stability: The infamously erratic price of Bitcoin will be stabilized with greater involvement through ETFs. The 2024 Bitcoin Bull Run The approval of Bitcoin ETFs in 2024 has been accompanied by a strong crypto bull market. Bitcoin’s price broke above $50,000 earlier in the year, driven by optimism around ETF-driven growth. Institutional investors, who were earlier skeptical, have begun pouring money into Bitcoin as a hedge against inflation and a store of value. Factors Driving the Bull Run Several factors have contributed to the Bitcoin price surge in 2024: ETF Approvals : The green light from regulators has opened floodgates for new investments. Increased Institutional Adoption : Hedge funds, pension funds, and asset managers are now participating in the market. Global Economic Uncertainty : Investors are turning to Bitcoin as a safe haven during times of inflation and geopolitical tensions. Retail Investor Interest : Buzz around ETFs has reignited interest among retail investors, creating additional demand. A Look at Institutional Adoption Institutional adoption is the key to Bitcoin’s success in 2024. While ETFs made Bitcoin more accessible to institutions, the latter started accepting it as a strategic asset. Unlike retail investors, institutions invest on a large scale and have a greater effect on the price of Bitcoin. Institutional Benefits of Bitcoin ETFs Impact Simplified Access Encourages larger investments. Regulatory Oversight Reduces risks of fraud. Liquidity Easier to enter and exit positions. Portfolio Diversification Bitcoin acts as a non-correlated asset. In that respect, these benefits have triggered an increase in institutional participation, a factor which has helped push Bitcoin’s price higher, and consequently widen its acceptance into the mainstream class of investments. ETF-Driven Growth and Market Dynamics The functions of ETFs go way beyond mere gains in prices. Their approval itself has gone through a chain in the cryptocurrency market at large. Consider the following instance:. Improved Sentiment : The regulatory nod for ETFs has increased confidence in Bitcoin and the entire crypto sector. More Innovation: The success of Bitcoin ETFs is encouraging conversations around Ethereum and other cryptocurrencies about their possible appearance as ETFs. Market Maturation: ETFs work towards a more organized and regularized market, which brings in conservative investors. Challenges and Risks While Bitcoin ETFs have brought optimism, there are also challenges to consider: Regulatory Risks : Future regulatory changes could impact ETF operations. Market Manipulation : Critics argue that ETFs could expose Bitcoin to new forms of manipulation. Over-reliance on Institutions : Heavy reliance on institutional investments might reduce Bitcoin’s decentralized ethos. Investors should remain aware of these risks and consider them while navigating the crypto bull market. The Road Ahead For the unparalleled price rise of Bitcoin, the role of ETFs is indispensable. These ETFs legitimize Bitcoin in the marketplace, therefore offering further access, credibility, and scope of expansion. From there on, much focus might happen in developing ETFs around other cryptocurrencies or some new financial instruments using such digital currencies. As this market matures, Bitcoin can finally assume a leading position in being a strong virtual asset in the global finance system. Bitcoin ETFs have been a cornerstone of the 2024 crypto bull run, leading price increases and institutional adoption. Their approval has lent credibility to Bitcoin, welcomed a wide array of investors, and shifted the dynamics of the cryptocurrency market. While there are still issues, this year’s progress underlines the increasing presence of cryptocurrencies within the traditional financial system.",Reviews|ETF,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|ETH|MARKET|TRADING,"{'name': 'Bitcoin World', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinworld,2024-12-18 10:02:42

This milestone reflects the growing popularity of Bitcoin as a modern alternative to traditional assets like gold. Despite gold ETFs having a 20-year advantage, Bitcoin ETFs have surged ahead within just a year of their launch in January 2024. The approval of Bitcoin spot ETFs in the US has bridged the gap between cryptocurrency and traditional finance, offering investors a regulated way to gain exposure to Bitcoin without directly owning it. This accessibility has driven significant demand from both institutional and retail investors , contributing to Bitcoin ETFs surpassing gold in AUM. Notable financial players, including BlackRock, Fidelity, and Ark Invest, have entered the Bitcoin ETF market, adding credibility and fueling competition. Gold ETFs have long been seen as a safe haven against inflation and economic instability. However, Bitcoin, often referred to as ""digital gold,"" has emerged as a modern, decentralized alternative with similar store-of-value qualities. Bitcoin’s capped supply of 21 million coins makes it an attractive hedge against inflation, especially for younger investors seeking innovation and higher returns. Bitcoin's remarkable price performance in 2024 has further solidified its appeal. Analysts suggest that this shift represents a generational change , with younger investors embracing Bitcoin’s technological and financial potential. Meanwhile, traditional investors seeking diversification are increasingly incorporating Bitcoin ETFs into their portfolios. The rapid growth of Bitcoin ETFs highlights a broader acceptance of cryptocurrencies within the financial system. After years of regulatory hurdles, US approval of Bitcoin spot ETFs in 2024 has set a global precedent, paving the way for similar products in other regions. This regulatory clarity has boosted confidence in Bitcoin as a legitimate financial asset . Despite concerns over Bitcoin’s volatility, its institutional adoption signals a maturing market. Experts predict that continued inflows from traditional investors could further expand Bitcoin’s lead over gold in the ETF market. As Bitcoin solidifies its position in mainstream finance, its rise underscores a fundamental transformation in investor preferences. This historic moment demonstrates that Bitcoin is no longer a fringe asset—it is now challenging gold’s status as the ultimate store of value. The shift reflects how innovation and decentralization are reshaping financial markets and redefining where investors place their trust.",,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|FIAT|MARKET|TRADING,"{'name': 'Coinpaprika', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/80/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaprika,2024-12-18 10:05:29

Spot Bitcoin ETFs Surpass Gold ETFs! Here's the Data!,https://en.bitcoinsistemi.com/bitcoin-takes-over-golds-throne-spot-bitcoin-etfs-surpass-gold-etfs-heres-the-data/,"Demand for spot Bitcoin ETFs has surged further following Donald Trump’s victory, with US Bitcoin ETFs surpassing gold funds in assets under management for the first time. As Bitcoin overtakes its arch-rival gold, K33 Research Head of Research Vetle Lunde recently shared that as of December 16, Bitcoin ETFs have surpassed US gold ETFs in total assets under management. The combined AUM of Bitcoin ETFs, including spot, futures, and leveraged funds, has reached $129 billion, analysts at K33 Research noted. Bloomberg ETF analyst Eric Balchunas also drew attention to Bitcoin's peace and said that it is a great success for Bitcoin ETFs to compete with gold in this way, especially despite being launched only 11 months ago. “If you include all Bitcoin ETFs (spot, futures, leveraged), they have $130 billion in assets compared to $128 billion in gold ETFs. However, if you look at just spot ETFs, BTC has $120 billion in assets compared to $125 billion in gold,” Balchunas said. ETF Store CEO Nate Geraci did not remain indifferent to the success of Bitcoin ETFs and stated that he expects Bitcoin ETFs to exceed gold ETFs in AUM by three times. Nate Geraci, in his post from the X account, predicted that from a long-term perspective, Bitcoin ETFs could triple the total assets under management of gold ETFs. Stating that Bitcoin ETFs currently have an AUM of $120 billion, while the AUM of gold ETFs is around $125 billion, Geraci stated that Bitcoin ETFs could reach three times that of gold ETFs. Geraci acknowledged that the three-fold estimate may seem ambitious, but added that the three-fold gap could widen further in the future. https://twitter.com/NateGeraci/status/1869192425073443109 *This is not investment advice.

This move comes as the firm faces significant regulatory challenges in the United States, where efforts to introduce a Solana ETF have been stalled. The BSOL ETP aims to attract investors with staking rewards of up to 8% annually, offering an appealing alternative to US-based ETFs, which are prohibited from providing such returns due to securities laws. This decision follows Bitwise’s acquisition of a European ETP issuer in August, which has enabled a smoother entry into the European market. By focusing on Europe, Bitwise is tapping into a region with more favorable regulatory conditions for staking products. Recently, similar Solana staking ETPs have been introduced in the EU, such as VanEck’s offering. These products remain unavailable in the US, where regulatory restrictions have created significant hurdles. The BSOL ETP highlights Bitwise's strategy to differentiate itself. The ability to offer staking rewards sets it apart from US ETFs , which are constrained by current securities laws. In the US, all ETF applications for Solana must exclude staking rewards. However, some experts speculate this could change under a different regulatory leadership at the SEC, potentially allowing US ETFs to integrate staking features in the future. Solana’s price has recently faced some market corrections but has maintained relative strength compared to other cryptocurrencies. While the launch of BSOL has not yet had a noticeable impact on Solana’s price, the token continues to exhibit bullish trends, keeping investor interest alive . Bitwise’s decision to prioritize Europe raises questions about its long-term strategy. If US regulations remain restrictive, the firm may deepen its focus on the European market. Alternatively, a more crypto-friendly SEC in the US could open the door for staking rewards and renew Bitwise's interest in launching a Solana ETF domestically. For now, BSOL offers a compelling option for European investors , providing both access to Solana and the opportunity to earn staking rewards. This move not only reflects Bitwise’s adaptability but also underscores the growing appeal of staking products in jurisdictions with more accommodating regulations.",,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|MARKET|REGULATION|SOL|TRADING,"{'name': 'Coinpaprika', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/80/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaprika,2024-12-18 10:10:41

In his tweet, Schwartz stated , “Since the idea of $RLUSD many months ago to launch in a matter of hours, I’ve been looking forward to more use cases realized on the XRPL and more liquidity on-chain with a trusted stablecoin like RLUSD.

Known for its strict regulatory standards, the NYDFS approval underscores RLUSD’s compliance and credibility within the digital asset market. RLUSD, designed to maintain a 1:1 peg to the U.S. dollar, offers transparency, stability, and reliability for users globally. This regulatory achievement further strengthens Ripple’s position in the digital payments and stablecoin sectors, ensuring that RLUSD is a trusted asset for enterprises, developers, and end-users. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Unlocking New Use Cases and On-Chain Liquidity The introduction of RLUSD is expected to drive liquidity and innovation within the XRP Ledger (XRPL), a decentralized and open-source blockchain network. Known for its speed, scalability, and low transaction costs, XRPL will benefit from RLUSD as a stable, on-chain asset for payments, lending, decentralized finance (DeFi), and other financial services. Schwartz highlighted RLUSD’s role in creating “countless opportunities” for developers and users. The stablecoin’s launch allows developers to build applications with reduced volatility risks, offering reliable solutions for cross-border transactions, decentralized applications (dApps), and financial products. Ripple’s Long-Term Vision for XRPL Adoption RLUSD’s launch aligns with Ripple’s strategy to expand the utility of XRPL and accelerate blockchain adoption globally. As a trusted stablecoin, RLUSD is expected to attract new participants to the ecosystem, improving liquidity for businesses and users while fostering innovation in financial services. David Schwartz’s remarks reflect Ripple’s broader goal of bridging traditional finance with blockchain technology.

At the time of writing, data from CoinGecko showed that the token had fallen by 57.8% within 24 hours to settle at $0.02892. Airdrop Aftermath The highly-anticipated airdrop launched on December 17 saw about 62.8 billion PENGU tokens distributed to millions of qualified NFT holders, traders, and team members. However, following an initial surge that catapulted the token into the top 100 cryptocurrencies by market cap, it suffered a swift sell-off that saw its value plummet by more than 60%, falling from a high of $0.06845 to a low of $0.027. Interestingly, the damage wasn’t limited to the cryptocurrency, with Pudgy Penguins’ NFT collection suffering a similar fate. Within a single day, it saw its floor price plunge by more than 48% to 17.1 ETH, about $64,450, a stark contrast to its all-time high (ATH) level of 36.33 ETH. The downtrend notwithstanding, information from CryptoSlam showed an increase in trading activity, with the collection’s daily sales volume skyrocketing 258% to $21.7 million. While some investors cashed out their holdings, others used the opportunity to buy the dip, with the average sale price currently sitting at 19.89 ETH. A Pattern of Post-Airdrop Volatility While the rapid drop in PENGU’s market value may have raised some eyebrows, the phenomenon is not particularly new, with several other cryptocurrency giveaways leading to a market frenzy. Some observers have attributed this to an emerging trend among airdrop recipients who quickly cash out their holdings, leading to a marked price instability at the beginning of a coin’s post-distribution trading. For example, NFT marketplace Magic Eden’s ME token and Movement Network’s MOVE also experienced similar patterns following their respective airdrops. Both of them registered sharp divestment, with ME in particular losing 80% of its value as thousands of claimants exited their positions. However, regardless of the turbulence, PENGU still retains a market cap just shy of $2 billion, placing it at #78 among the largest cryptocurrencies in the market. Additionally, as of this writing, its price had made some marginal recoveries and was 10.5% above its lowest level recorded only hours ago.

This happened with new milestones set by the token, giving holders a perfect crypto trading experience. Let’s see how this Pudgy Penguin token equipped a trader with heavy returns. PENGU Token Launch Turned Crypto Trader’s $6 Into 87K The crypto exchange Binance went through PENGU token launch yesterday, fueling its demand with a massive crypto airdrop. The exchange has listed the token for spot trading with pairs like USD, BNB, FDUSD, and TRY and distributed almost half of the total supply. Interestingly, the Pudgy Penguin token was already in demand due to the impressive success of the Pudgy Penguin NFT collection. And this one crypto trader utilized the same demand, turning $6 into $870k. As per Arkham Intelligence, the crypto trader invested only $6 to buy the PENGU coin before the main liquidity pool launched the token on the Solana network and paired it with $1100 of SOL. During the same period, the trader succeeded in snipping the token at an unreasonably low price. However, that grew multiple folds, resulting in the PENGU price soaring 800% .

The token formed a massive peak right after the launch, setting an ATH at $0.04989. However, a mass sell-off from the early holders and the PENGU airdrop-induced volatility has affected the PENGU price. More importantly, a now-fixed token glitch in the Binance airdrop put an unsatisfactory beginning for the token. Fast forward to now, the PENGU price is $0.03336, with a market capitalization of $2.08B, per CoinmarketCap. Despite a 33% drop from the peak, it is up by 567% in 24 hours. This is the consolidation period for the token induced by the sudden demand around the listing time. Once this is over, the PENGU coin can re-enter a bullish trajectory with the support of exchange listings and market demand. What’s In There For You? PENGU is the native token for the popular Pudgy Penguin NFT ecosystem, which includes 8,888 penguin-themed NFTs. The NFT project has recently listed its official crypto asset in the market with a major PENGU airdrop through Binance, which first pumped the token price to 800% before facing a mass sell-off. Within this period, a crypto trader made 14,500x returns with his PENGU tokens, turning $6 into $87K. Many similar users have had profitable crypto trading experiences, but a few sold early in fear, missing the opportunity.

Santa Rides Shiba (SANTSHIB), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 19,000% in price in the coming days. This is because SANTSHIB is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Santa Rides Shiba can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Santa Rides Shiba could become the next viral memecoin. Santa Rides Shiba launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Santa Rides Shiba on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Santa Rides Shiba by entering its contract address – CxpeR8vdgeVWZFwBytS7PRrXHBwVgPJWZBJUcpK3k7vT – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like SANTSHIB. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Press Releases,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|DOGE|EXCHANGE|SHIB|SOL,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2024-12-18 11:32:00

ASIC claims that Binance misclassified over 500 retail investors as wholesale clients, denying them important consumer protections under Australian law. The charges are serious and Binance needs strong evidence to come out clean as in worse worst-case scenario they might lose their licence in Australia. What Happened? Between July 2022 and April 2023, Binance Australia allowed retail investors to trade risky crypto derivative products. However, these investors were wrongly labeled as wholesale clients, which meant they didn’t receive essential protections like proper disclosure statements and access to dispute resolution schemes. This misclassification affected 83% of Binance’s Australian clients. ASIC’s Concerns ASIC has accused Binance of not operating fairly and abiding by the laws. According to the regulator, Binance’s compliance systems were inadequate and not transparent, as an outcome many clients reportedly suffered financial losses. ASIC Deputy Chair Sarah Court stated that Binance failed to meet the requirements of its financial services license. What’s Next for Binance? Binance compliance issues are not new and many countries have taken down Binance’s violations strictly like Nigeria, India, and US agencies even linked the firm to illegal money laundering cases to fund terrorist groups in Hamas. Currently, Binance is facing an Intellectual property theft case in the US. In the meanwhile, Mark Longo, who owns Peanut the Squirrel, has asked Binance to stop using the name “PNUT” for its memecoin, saying it violates his trademark. ASIC Crypto Crackdown Before Binance, ASIC fined Kraken, a major crypto platform, for offering illegal margin trading products in Australia which caused local traders to lose over $8 million. For investors, these recent cases are reminders of the importance of proper protection and the risks involved in trading crypto derivatives. While the US is planning to bring crypto-friendly regulations other countries are still struggling to streamline crypto asset challenges with old restricted crypto policies. Will it be too late for Australia to realize the real crypto game?

Wall Street is pushing for Ripple’s XRP to win a U.S.-listed spot ETF, following in the footsteps of Bitcoin and Ether (ETH), which scored their own spot ETFs earlier this year. However, the Bloomberg analyst suggests that an XRP, or even Solana (ETF), will likely happen after a Litecoin ETF launches. Bitcoin, Ethereum Combo Funds To Lead ETF Wave Of 2025 Bloomberg’s Eric Balchunas took to X to reveal that he expects “a wave of cryptocurrency ETFs next year, albeit not all at once”, sharing an analysis from fellow ETF analyst James Seyffart. Balchunas anticipates Bitcoin and Ethereum combo ETFs hitting the market, as well as potential offerings for Litecoin, XRP, Solana, and HBAR. In fact, he is certain that the new Bitcoin and Ether combo funds will be greenlighted first, followed by ETFs tracking Litecoin (LTC) or Hedera Hashgraph (HBAR) ETFs. Notably, asset managers, including Bitwise, Hashdex, and Franklin Templeton, have already filed to introduce the Bitcoin and Ethereum combo ETFs. The SEC is widely expected to embrace a more crypto-friendly outlook next year after pro-crypto Paul Atkins was nominated to replace crypto foe SEC Chair Gary Gensler. Gensler announced that he would step down from the agency on the day of Trump’s inauguration on Jan. 20. However, this does not mean that XRP ETFs will be greenlit shortly after Atkins takes office, according to the Bloomberg ETF expert. XRP, Solana ETFs Not Coming In Near Future? Notably, Balchunas doesn’t think the Securities and Exchange Commission will soon approve spot XRP and SOL ETFs. As you know, both XRP and Solana have been named as securities in pending lawsuits in the US. As such, these issues must first be resolved before the SEC can grant its approval. But, neither LTC nor HBAR has ever been called a security by the SEC, which makes their path to spot exchange-traded funds less complex than larger market-cap assets like XRP and Solana. Moreover, Litecoin is a fork of Bitcoin, hence it may be considered a “commodity”, just like its progenitor. While Balchunas sees HABR and LTC as having a higher likelihood of winning SEC approval, he said it is unclear whether there is enough investor demand for the ETF products. As of press time, Canary Capital is the only asset manager that has filed registration documents for a spot LTC ETF with the SEC.",Cryptocurrency|News|Litecoin|LTC|Ripple|Solana|XRP News,EN,0,0,BTC|LTC|REGULATION|SOL|XRP,"{'name': 'ZyCrypto', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/zycrypto.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",zycrypto,2024-12-18 11:32:51

One of the factors that made the company eligible for inclusion was a market gap gain, driven by gains in Bitcoin, an asset that MicroStrategy holds in vast quantities. MicroStrategy is financing its Bitcoin buys with equity and debt. This creates risks for shareholders. Equity dilution becomes a major cost when the asset bought with share issuance proceeds declines in price. Debt servicing can become an issue when asset prices collapse enough. For these reasons, I consider MicroStrategy stock unsuitable for most investors. MicroStrategy ( MSTR ) made headlines Yesterday when it was picked for inclusion in the NASDAQ-100 index. The company’s index inclusion was spurred in no small part by a series of well-timed Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) purchases, which took its market cap to a level where it was eligible to be added to the index. Although many investors were optimistic that MicroStrategy’s index inclusion would lift the stock, MSTR actually dipped in the days after the NASDAQ inclusion news was announced. It should be noted that MSTR’s actual index inclusion does not occur until December 23. The stock may yet experience a post-inclusion rally. However, investors who anticipate the inclusion may be making bets on the effect of index inclusion already. There is significant money to be made by front-running index fund buys, and MSTR will be in NASDAQ-100 index funds soon enough. Tuesday trading in MSTR seems to indicate that investors either don’t think that index inclusion will lift MSTR much, or think it will have a positive impact that will be outweighed by issues facing the company. Speaking of issues: MicroStrategy would face a large one if Bitcoin were to embark on a large, long-lasting drawdown–something BTC has, in fact, done many times in the past . The company is using a mix of debt and equity to finance its Bitcoin purchases, and these both come with problems in the event that the asset purchased goes down in price. Debt comes with interest expenses, which in MSTR’s case were already high as a percentage of the company’s revenue before the Bitcoin purchases. Equity issuance, on the other hand, reduces the percentage of the total enterprise that is owned by the pre-issuance shareholders. In other words, unless the asset purchased appreciates or pays income exceeding the amount of dilution, the dilution makes each share worth less. It’s certainly possible for MicroStrategy’s Bitcoin buying strategy to work out. Bitcoin has many advantages over other cryptocurrencies, including its supply cap, higher hash rate and greater decentralization . Cryptocurrency is useful for people who have one reason or another to be wary of their spending being tracked–a category that includes not just black market participants, but also political dissidents. As long as this use case remains, Bitcoin is likely to enjoy some measure of non-speculative demand. If that’s the case, then Bitcoin’s market value represents more than just a bubble, and its price could keep going up. With all that being said, Bitcoin’s historical volatility indicates that drawdowns far in excess of 50% are possible if not likely. Since its creation in 2009, Bitcoin has undergone at least five crashes greater than 50% , and three of those were greater than 80%. Therefore, it would be wise for those holding Bitcoin and its corporate proxy, MicroStrategy, to model for scenarios where the cryptocurrency declines by that much, to see whether their portfolios would survive it. As for Bitcoin itself: history teaches that it would likely recover from such a hypothetical crash. It has done so in the past, and it still has both its use case and its advantages over other cryptos. However, it’s not necessarily the case that Bitcoin holders would survive such an event. A retiree holding an asset at heavy weighting prior to it declining 80% in price would be in trouble, as would a person at any age holding the asset while being in debt. That latter category includes MicroStrategy. As of its most recent financial report, MSTR had 12% more debt than equity , and 343% more operating costs than revenue. The company cannot finance all of its obligations from operations alone. MicroStrategy does have more revenue than interest expense, with a ‘revenue interest coverage’ ratio of 6.4. That sounds reasonable but remember that that revenue has to pay interest along with operating expenses; the company’s deeply negative operating income cannot cover interest expenses. So, it looks like either Bitcoin sales, operating asset sales or debt refinancing will be needed to keep those interest payments at bay. For this reason, MicroStrategy is highly vulnerable to the price volatility inherent in Bitcoin, and is not a buy for risk-averse investors. Equity Raises Shortly after the release of its third quarter earnings, MicroStrategy announced a plan to buy $42 billion worth of Bitcoin, financed by 50% equity and 50% debt. Both the debt and the equity components of this plan have their risks. The risks of equity are the easiest to explain, so I’ll start with those. The risk of issuing equity is that doing so threatens to make shares that existed prior to the issuance, worth less than before. When equity is issued, the immediate effect is to replace a percentage of per-share ownership with an equivalent value in cash. Initially, the effect on shareholder wealth is zero, less a small impact from investment banking fees. However, as time goes on, the company has to invest the newly raised cash in lucrative opportunities, otherwise inflation and opportunity costs erode the value of the cash raised to the point where it reduces shareholder wealth in real terms. So, MicroStrategy’s equity raises present a risk to shareholders if the new Bitcoin purchases don’t work out. With MSTR continuing to buy Bitcoin at all-time highs, the possibility of said purchases not working out is real. With that being said, the risks with the equity raises are not existential ones. It’s a different story with debt. Debt The debt that MicroStrategy is taking out to finance its Bitcoin purchases is an existential threat in a scenario where Bitcoin declines precipitously in price. The reason is simple: debt creates interest expenses, and MicroStrategy does not generate enough operating income to cover those expenses. Therefore, the company will need to either sell Bitcoin or refinance its debt to keep covering its interest expenses. In the event that Bitcoin crashes, that becomes hard to do. How steep a fall in the price of Bitcoin would be required in order for MSTR to experience solvency issues? We can get at that by reviewing some facts: MicroStrategy had $4.21 billion worth of debt, bearing $18 million in quarterly interest expenses at the end of the third quarter. The future amount of interest is higher because the company issued a $1 billion interest-bearing bond right before the quarter ended (on September 20 ). The yield on the $1 billion note was 0.625%, meaning it adds $6.25 million in annual interest expenses. It’s likely that none of this showed up in the third quarter income statement because the new bond does not make its first payment until March 15, 2025. Therefore, forward annual interest expense is likely $78.25 million ($6.25 million plus $72 million from the previously mentioned $18 million quarterly payments). The company issued $3 billion in convertible debt since the end of the third quarter (with no interest attached to it). That brings the total debt to $7.21 billion. It has $2.05 billion in maturities coming up in the next five years. MSTR’s Bitcoin was worth $44.5 billion at the time of this writing. Given the above facts, what level of Bitcoin price decline would cause serious problems for MSTR? One thing we know is that, at an 84% price decline, MicroStrategy’s Bitcoin value would drop below the value of its debt. Such a decline would take the company’s Bitcoin to $7.12 billion. That’s not such an immediate threat in itself because the company’s debt carries very little interest. However, it could be a threat over time: $78.25 million in interest is a little over 1% of $7.12 billion, so MicroStrategy having to sell Bitcoin at such a level would gradually chip away at the value of the BTC holdings. Also, MicroStrategy has two maturities totaling $2.05 billion coming up in 2027 and 2028, which would eat up 28.8% of the company’s Bitcoin in a scenario where BTC were down 84% from today’s level. Last but not least, MicroStrategy had about $398 million more operating costs than revenue last quarter, which works out to $1.59 billion per year, and that also has to be covered somehow. Unless the operating business were sold off, these expenses would eat up all of MicroStrategy’s Bitcoin in 4.47 years, in a scenario where BTC had declined 84% in price. Considering the maturities, interest expenses and operating expenses all together, the costs would burn through all of MSTR’s Bitcoin in about three years–again assuming it’s down 84%. That would be a real solvency risk for MicroStrategy. Now, of course, the above assumes that MicroStrategy doesn’t refinance its debt or sell its operating business. Selling the operating business is an option, although it only kicks the can down the road a few years. Refinancing debt creates issues because, if Bitcoin were down 84%, then MicroStrategy’s stock would likely be down too, meaning there’d be little appetite for convertible bonds and the company would probably have to issue at very high interest rates to get any takers. For these reasons, I believe that MicroStrategy would be existentially threatened in a situation where Bitcoin declined 84% in price. Valuation An additional concern for anybody considering going long MicroStrategy today is that the company is arguably overvalued, even in a scenario where Bitcoin trades flat or goes up slightly. The company currently trades at 21.94 times last quarter’s book value . It also trades at 162 times sales. The “actual” price/book ratio is likely somewhat lower now because of the gains Bitcoin has made, but is still probably greater than one. This begs the question: why pay a premium for a stock that has become essentially a bet on another asset? MicroStrategy’s operations are nowhere near profitable; if the company has anything going for it, it’s the Bitcoin horde. However, it trades at very high multiples to said horde, and its heavy amount of leverage creates severe problems in a scenario where Bitcoin declines precipitously in price. MicroStrategy multiples (Seeking Alpha Quant) A Concluding Note Before concluding, I should address one critique that could be made of the argument I outlined in this article: that the scenario I modelled (a -84% BTC price change) is very extreme. It is extreme, but not unprecedented: as I showed at the start of the article, BTC has declined more than 80% in price at least three times. It’s plausible to think it will do so again. Additionally, sometimes extreme scenarios can illustrate general principles. Although MicroStrategy would not become insolvent with Bitcoin down 40%, 50% or 60%, the issues that appear in my -84% scenario appear in milder forms in smaller BTC price crashes. Does MicroStrategy cease existing because of a 50% Bitcoin price dip? No, but the general problem that my model uncovered–the problem of having to sell off Bitcoin at unfavorable prices to cover operating expenses and interest–definitely starts rearing its ugly head in such a scenario. For this reason, I think that MicroStrategy faces too much tail risk to be investable. Sure, the company will thrive if Bitcoin keeps rising, but it isn’t prudent to just assume that a raging bull market will continue forever. It’s in the nature of volatile assets to come down in price sometimes, and Bitcoin is nothing if not volatile.",BTC-USD|MSTR,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|TRADING,"{'name': 'Seeking Alpha', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/seekingalpha.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",seekingalpha,2024-12-18 11:33:30

According to a Dec. 18 announcement, the Solana (SOL)-based staking ETP has been listed on the Frankfurt Stock Exchange’s Xetra trading venue in partnership with Marinade, a self-custodial automation tool. At the time of publication, Bitwise had not responded to Cointelegraph’s request for additional details about the partnership. The new ETP offers an annual percentage yield (APY) of 6.48% for stakers, surpassing European competitors like 21Shares, which provides an APY of 5.49%. Competitive Fees to Challenge Rivals BSOL’s management fee is set at 0.85%, significantly undercutting 21Shares’ 2.5% fee. In November, Bitwise registered a statutory trust in Delaware for its proposed spot Solana ETF, though it still awaits further regulatory filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Bridging Gaps in Solana ETPs Bitwise’s first Solana ETP in Europe, ESOL, debuted in August following its acquisition of ETC Group. While ESOL lacked staking rewards, BSOL integrates this feature, addressing a key gap in the market. The acquisition also added nine European-listed crypto ETPs to Bitwise’s portfolio, boosting its assets under management to over $4.5 billion. Currently, ESOL holds $24 million in assets under management. Bullish Outlook on Crypto ETFs VanEck’s head of digital asset research, Matthew Sigel, predicts a high likelihood of U.S. approval for a spot Solana ETF by the end of 2025. Bitwise executives Matt Hougan and Ryan Rasmussen recently forecast that Bitcoin could hit $200,000 or more by the end of 2025 and potentially surpass gold’s $18 trillion market cap by 2029. They also expect at least five “crypto unicorns,” such as Circle and Kraken, to go public in 2025.",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Crypto Intelligence,EN,0,0,BTC|EXCHANGE|MARKET|SOL|TRADING,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2024-12-18 11:34:17

The famous crypto asset management firm, Bitwise, just launched its Bitwise Solana Staking ETP (BSOL). They launched the product on Deutsche Börse Xetra. It is a great product for investors looking for institutional grade exposure to Solana. It is paired with the benefits of staking rewards. This launch shows the growing dominance of Solana in the blockchain space . Why This ETP Stands Out This isn’t Bitwise’s first rodeo in staking ETPs. They previously introduced Ethereum and Aptos staking ETPs, but the new Solana focused product feels special. Solana is famous for its incredible speed of 65k transactions per second and scalable architecture. The blockchain is quickly becoming a favorite among developers as well as investors. With Bitwise Solana Staking ETP, the firm taps into its potential and gives European investors low cost and transparent access to Solana staking. BSOL is designed to provide superior staking returns, which are like dividends for crypto. But unlike regular staking, this product removes the complexities. It’s fully backed and linked to the Compass Solana Total Return Monthly Index, ensuring transparency in tracking performance. Solana is one of the finest blockchains available in the market with a whole ecosystem surrounding it. This launch represents Bitwise’s confidence in Solana’s future. As Hunter Horsley, the company’s CEO, pointed out, Solana is becoming a rising star in the crypto asset world. The ETP underscores Bitwise’s strategy to offer high-quality staking products that meet the needs of serious investors. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Solana Struggles Below $215: Is It Going To Recover? , What to Expect The company’s total client assets have already surpassed $12 billion in 2024, and its recent acquisition of ETC Group solidifies its position in Europe. BSOL is part of a broader European push, following earlier hits like their Ethereum staking ETP and physically backed Bitcoin ETP. With Bitwise Solana Staking ETP , retail investors will get easier access to innovative crypto products. The asset management firm plans to keep expanding its European portfolio with more cutting-edge offerings while maintaining its commitment to transparency and low costs. This product launch is a step forward in making crypto more accessible and rewarding not just for institutions but for retail investors as well. The future looks promising, and Bitwise seems determined to lead the way. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

While famous meme coins have captured headlines, lesser-known digital assets quietly hold the potential for life-changing returns. Exploring five under-the-radar tokens, this article dives into promising opportunities that could transform a modest sum into a fortune by the middle of 2025. DOGEN: The First Memetoken for Alpha Males Who Demand the Best Unleash your inner alpha with DOGEN, the meme token built for those who want to live a beautiful life. DOGEN is the alpha dog that never misses a chance to win big . This is the token for winners who won’t settle for anything less. Think luxury cars, stacks of cash, and beautiful women — that’s the Alpha DOGEN lifestyle! HODL Like a Boss, Conquer the Market Ready to live like an Alpha DOGEN and enjoy the finer things in life? It’s on the runway, gearing up for a 700% takeoff by the end of the presale — and that’s just the start. With DOGEN, you’re looking at potential thousand-fold returns as memetokens lead the hottest trend of this altcoin season. The earlier you jump in, the more you win! It’s a deal that others will envy, and you’ll be at the top of the pack. Missed WIF, Popcat or Ponke rise? DOGEN is the new doggie on the Solana memetokens ground alongside BONK, WIF, and Popcat known for their astonishing 1000% growth . Currently undervalued, DOGEN is poised to take this crypto narrative to the next level, potentially breaking records in this bull run. Community-Driven with Real Value DOGEN isn’t just a short-lived hype; it’s a growing movement . The team behind DOGEN is laser-focused on building a thriving community of alpha leaders who refuse to settle for less and are geared up to dominate the market. This token offers real value , from exciting campaigns to exclusive perks for early adopters. DOGEN is an opportunity to be part of something that lasts. DOGEN’s multi-level referral program is as fierce as it gets: You’ll score 7% from every token your direct bros (1st level) buy using your referral code. Plus, there are more rewards down the line — you can grow your profits as your referrals bring in even more users. Hold DOGEN and let others envy you! Join the Dogen Army today and conquer the crypto world! BONK: A Solana-Based Memecoin with Community Focus BONK is a memecoin on the Solana blockchain featuring a Shiba Inu mascot. It was designed to shift influence away from venture capital tokens and empower the Solana community. Half of its total supply was distributed via airdrops to users in Solana’s NFT and DeFi sectors. After being listed on Coinbase, its value rose over 100%, becoming the third-largest memecoin by market cap in late 2023. BONK has gained traction with initiatives like BonkSwap, a decentralized exchange. Its large supply and the nature of memecoins create challenges, but continued development in the Solana ecosystem makes BONK a relevant cryptocurrency in today’s market. It appears attractive for those seeking involvement within the Solana space. Dogwifhat: A Dog-Themed Meme Coin on Solana Dogwifhat (WIF) is a meme coin on the Solana blockchain inspired by the Dogwifhat meme. It is part of a growing trend of dog-themed tokens in the cryptocurrency world. These coins focus on building communities and creating online engagement. WIF uses the Solana network, known for its speed and low transaction costs. The coin’s appeal lies in its playful theme and the strong potential for viral attention. Its value depends heavily on maintaining interest and community growth. In the current market, its attractiveness depends on trends in meme coins and market conditions. Like all meme coins, success is tied to community efforts rather than underlying technology or utility. PEPE Memecoin: Tribute to an Internet Icon PEPE is a deflationary memecoin inspired by the Pepe the Frog meme. It was launched on the Ethereum network to honor this early internet phenomenon. The coin stands out with no transaction taxes, a focus on memes, and no utility claims, staying true to its comedic roots. In mid-2023, PEPE reached a market cap of $1.6 billion, sparking global interest in memecoins. It uses a burn mechanism to reduce its supply and rewards long-term holders. Listed on major platforms like Binance and KuCoin, PEPE benefits from Ethereum’s secure network. Whether PEPE remains attractive depends on market interest in memes and tokens with limited practical use. Floki Cryptocurrency: From Meme Coin to Expanding Ecosystem Floki began as a meme coin influenced by Elon Musk’s tweet about naming his Shiba Inu “Floki” in 2021. It has since moved toward a more utility-driven approach. The coin supports projects like the NFT game Valhalla and DeFi platform FlokiFi. It also enables real-world transactions via its prepaid Floki Card and partnership with NOWPayments. Floki works on charity initiatives, such as building schools in Laos and Nigeria. Its recognition as a leading meme coin in 2023 shows its growing potential. Floki’s mix of NFTs, decentralized finance, and charitable aims makes it stand out among meme coins, presenting an attractive option for those seeking utility-focused cryptocurrency projects. Conclusion BONK, WIF, PEPE, and FLOKI show promise but may take longer to deliver significant gains. DOGEN stands out as a token built for those who demand the finest. With an expected 700% growth by the end of its presale and the potential for explosive returns, DOGEN targets market dominance and offers exclusive perks to its loyal supporters.

In a letter to Trump, Warren emphasized the need for Musk to address potential conflicts of interest if he is to continue advising the incoming administration. The letter from Warren highlights existing rules published by the General Services Administration. These rules mandate that transition team members avoid both real and perceived conflicts of interest. The democratic party Senator from Massachusetts pointed out that members are prohibited from engaging in matters that could affect their financial interests. Despite these stipulations, it remains unclear whether Musk, whose net worth is valued at $474 billion by the Bloomberg Billionaire Index , is subject to these standards. Musk, renowned for founding Tesla and SpaceX, holds a dual role in the transition process. He is not only serving as an adviser but also co-leading a proposed advisory board aimed at eliminating government waste, named the Department of Government Efficiency (D.O.G.E.). Warren questions Musk’s ethics and political influence Speaking to MSNBC, Warren expressed alarm over Musk’s unchecked influence, especially given his business empire’s entanglement with government contracts and regulatory issues. Warren argued that multiple of the Tesla CEO’s companies are directly involved with the US government. To her, Musk’s close relationship with US President-elect Trump could possibly make those companies “richer.” “These are conflicts of interest in levels that have never been seen before,” she said in the interview. Elizabeth Warren takes issue with @elonmusk advising Trump on efficiency. Apparently creating electric cars, reusable rockets, and brain interfaces counts as ""nothing for society"" in her world. pic.twitter.com/sHps2kQuXC — Mario Nawfal (@MarioNawfal) December 18, 2024 Musk has been a visible and vocal supporter of Trump since his presidential campaign. His efforts included hosting events, making media appearances and funding initiatives to boost voter turnout. Notably, Musk’s advocacy for Trump’s platform aligns closely with his business interests. For instance, Trump has pledged to accelerate federal initiatives, such as SpaceX’s Mars exploration programs, while Musk’s Tesla benefits from federal subsidies for its electric vehicle infrastructure. “Putting Mr. Musk in a position to influence billions of dollars of government contracts and regulatory enforcement without a stringent conflict of interest agreement in place is an invitation for corruption on a scale not seen in our lifetimes,” Warren’s letter remarked. The US Senator also noted that ethical oversight is critical to ensuring the government does not become a vehicle for enriching America’s wealthiest individuals. Ties to the Trump administration The extent of Musk’s involvement in the administration extends beyond advocacy. He has emerged as a central figure in shaping government policies and spending priorities, raising questions about impartiality. Meanwhile, several of Musk’s ventures, including Tesla, SpaceX, Starlink, and Neuralink, face regulatory scrutiny or have contracts with federal agencies. Tesla is currently under investigation by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration for pedestrian accidents involving its vehicles. Additionally, the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has raised potential securities fraud concerns regarding Musk’s recent activities. Other enterprises, such as Neuralink and Starlink, also have pending regulatory matters before federal authorities. When questioned by Time magazine about potential conflicts of interest, Trump dismissed concerns, stating that Musk prioritizes the country over his business interests. “ He considers this to be his most important project, ” Trump said. However, Warren’s letter contests this narrative, citing Musk’s vast financial stakes and the potential for ethical breaches. She called for transparency and a robust conflict-of-interest agreement to safeguard public trust in the administration. In a statement addressing Warren’s concerns, Trump’s transition team spokesperson Karoline Leavitt dismissed the senator’s critique as political theater. “… Pocahontas (Warren) can play political games and send toothless letters, but the Trump-Vance transition will continue to be held to the highest ethical and legal standards possible—a standard unfamiliar to a career politician whose societal impact is 1/1024th of Elon Musk’s .” From Zero to Web3 Pro: Your 90-Day Career Launch Plan",News|DOGE|SpaceX|Tesla|USD|xAI,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|DOGE|EXCHANGE|MARKET|REGULATION,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2024-12-18 11:43:42

Bitcoin and Ether Combo ETF Expected to Pave Way for New Crypto ETFs The crypto exchange-traded fund (ETF) landscape in the United States is poised for major developments in 2025, and a Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) combo ETF is expected to lead a new wave of crypto funds. Bloomberg senior ETF analyst Eric Balchunas and fellow analyst James Seyffart believe that this inaugural ETF will be followed by others tracking assets like Litecoin (LTC) and Hedera (HBAR). Seyffart acknowledged that there are still some regulatory challenges faced by certain crypto assets, especially after the Securities and Exchange Commission’s (SEC) rejection of Solana (SOL) ETFs on Dec. 7. He explained that ETFs tied to assets like SOL and XRP are unlikely to advance until a new SEC chair is selected and assumes office. The analysts pointed out that Litecoin and Hedera are viewed more favorably by regulators, which increases their likelihood of approval. Litecoin’s status as a Bitcoin fork and its potential classification as a “commodity” boosts its chances as well. The fact that Hedera is not labeled as a security by the SEC also gives it a regulatory advantage. In contrast, XRP and SOL face more serious regulatory hurdles. The SEC classified both as securities, and Ripple is already engaged in a legal battle over XRP’s status. Despite these challenges, Balchunas and Seyffart are still a bit uncertain about the investor demand for Litecoin and Hedera ETFs, even if they are approved. The potential shift in the SEC’s stance on crypto is linked to Trump’s expected nomination of Paul Atkins, a pro-crypto businessman and former SEC commissioner, as the agency's next chair. This move could start a shift toward de-regulation and more crypto-friendly policies. The current SEC Chair Gary Gensler announced his resignation , effective on Trump’s inauguration day on Jan. 20. Bitwise Launches Solana Staking ETP in Europe Solana’s regulatory hurdles are not holding everyone back. Bitwise launched a Solana staking exchange-traded product (ETP) in Europe under the stock ticker BSOL to strengthen its presence in the European crypto market. The ETP was introduced on Dec. 17 in partnership with Marinade, a self-custodial automation tool, and offers an annual percentage yield (APY) of 6.48%. This is more than competitors like 21Shares, which provides an APY of about 5.49%. BSOL’s very competitive management fee of 0.85% also challenges its European rivals, including 21Shares. The ETP was launched as Bitwise still awaits regulatory approval for a spot Solana ETF in the United States. In November, the firm registered a statutory trust in Delaware as a precursor to filing with the SEC. While Bitwise awaits the green light, VanEck’s head of digital asset research Matthew Sigel is still confident that the approval odds for a U.S. spot Solana ETF will be “overwhelmingly high” by the end of 2025. Bitwise’s European expansion started in August with the launch of its first Solana ETP, ESOL, which does not offer staking rewards. The introduction of BSOL addresses this gap by providing an integrated staking feature. Bitwise’s European footprint was also boosted by its acquisition of ETC Group, adding nine crypto ETPs to its portfolio and raising its assets under management to over $4.5 billion. The ESOL product currently holds about $24 million in assets under management. (Source: Bitwise ) Bitwise is still optimistic about the future of crypto markets. Investment chief Matt Hougan and research head Ryan Rasmussen predict that at least five crypto unicorns, including Circle and Kraken, will go public by 2025. Bitcoin ETFs Surpass Gold in AUM Balchunas and Seyffart might be right about Bitcoin’s power in the ETF space. Net assets in U.S. Bitcoin ETFs surpassed those in gold funds for the first time. On Dec. 16, Bitcoin ETFs collectively reached $129 billion in assets under management (AUM), surpassing U.S. gold ETFs, according to K33 Research. Eric Balchunas pointed out that the AUM figure includes both spot Bitcoin ETFs and those tracking the crypto through derivatives like futures. He also shed some light on the very rapid growth of Bitcoin ETFs, and stated that it is remarkable that they are competing with gold only 11 months after spot Bitcoin ETF launched. If spot ETFs alone are considered, Bitcoin ETFs hold $120 billion compared to gold’s $125 billion. The rise of Bitcoin ETFs started in January with the launch of spot BTC funds after a lengthy approval process by the SEC. Since then, Bitcoin ETFs have grown very quickly, and broke the $100 billion in net assets by November. Analysts believe this impressive growth was due to a more positive outlook for Bitcoin, which was spurred by market dynamics after Donald Trump’s election victory. BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) leads the market by managing close to $60 billion in assets, and surpassed BlackRock’s own iShares Gold Trust (IAU) in November. Investors are increasingly turning to Bitcoin and gold as part of a “debasement trade,” which is a strategy aimed at hedging against economic uncertainties. JPMorgan noticed this trend back in October, and linked it to rising geopolitical tensions, persistent inflation concerns, and high government deficits. Bitcoin Poised for $200K by 2025 Bitcoin’s price is expected to see a lot of growth in 2025, driven by strong institutional demand and increasing adoption, according to analysts at Bitfinex. In a Dec. 17 market report , they predicted that Bitcoin could reach a minimum of $145,000 by mid-2025, with a best-case scenario of $200,000 under more favorable conditions. While they still predict some price volatility in the first quarter of the year, they believe any dips will be short-lived because of large inflows into spot Bitcoin ETFs and the rising global and institutional adoption. Since the launch of U.S.-based spot Bitcoin ETFs in January, these funds attracted approximately $36 billion, making them major players in the market with holdings exceeding 1.13 million BTC. This institutional interest is considered to be a key factor in stabilizing Bitcoin’s price during market corrections. The current Bitcoin price of around $104,000 is already prompting long-term bullish projections from well known voices in the crypto industry. Nic Carter of Castle Island Ventures suggested that Bitcoin could eventually reach $900,000 to match gold’s market cap. Bitfinex analysts shared various scenarios for Bitcoin’s future trajectory. If the price mirrors the 2021 cycle, it could potentially reach $339,000, which is a 40% increase above its moving averages. In a more conservative scenario resembling the extended 2017 cycle, Bitcoin might peak at around $290,000 by early 2026. Speculation around the United States creating a strategic Bitcoin reserve also adds another layer of intrigue. After Donald Trump’s election victory, pro-crypto Senator Cynthia Lummis shared her plans to propose legislation for the U.S. government to buy and hold Bitcoin for at least 20 years. Crypto analyst Tyler Durden believes that such a move by any nation could disrupt the traditional four-year market cycles and create a new narrative for Bitcoin’s price trajectory.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,BTC|FIAT|MARKET|REGULATION|SOL,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2024-12-18 11:47:29

33767162,[object Object],1734523042,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/33767162.jpeg,Crypto All-Stars Presale Ends This Friday: Hype for DEX Launch,https://bitcoinist.com/crypto-all-stars-presale-ends-friday/,"Crypto All-Stars presale ends on Friday and has already raised a commendable $21M+. The anticipation of its native token, $STARS, being listed on a top-tier decentralized exchange (DEX) early next week is fueling excitement about the presale’s end. $STARS powering the world’s first unified meme coin staking protocol during the same time frame is further elevating the buzz. It’s no wonder investors are rushing to the presale to buy as many $STARS tokens as possible in anticipation of the token’s price spiking. A Reward Multiplier on a Novel Staking Protocol Once it goes live, $STARS will play a key role in the MemeVault, acting as a reward multiplier on the novel staking protocol. The more the meme coin market grows, the more potential to bet on and join in this macro growth with exposure to a number of coins. Further boosting the meme coin’s credibility, $STARS HODLers reduce the circulating supply to create scarcity, which often increases the price of the remaining tokens available to trade. Owing to these reasons, there’s enormous potential for the coin to spike once being listed on a crypto exchange after the presale finishes. There’s also a good deal of FOMO as the frequency of buys has increased now on the last stage. There are only three days to buy $STARS for just $0.0016782. The price tag likely won’t be this low again. This makes now an opportune time to buy, as evidenced by the recent snatching of $2M $STARS. Crypto Analyst: $STARS Will Double Post-DEX Listing Considering $STARS early success, it wouldn’t come as a surprise if it were to be listed on a leading DEX like Uniswap, which has an impressive $1.42B 24-hour trading volume . Plugging into the exchange’s 5.19M 30-day users could significantly boost the coin’s demand and adoption, bringing its value to greater heights. The DEX also aligns with the blockchain’s true ethos: decentralization, making it more attractive to meme coin lovers who value the privacy of decentralized finance (DeFi). Over the past 24-hours, there’s been major whale activity. Highlighting significant interest in $STARS, an investor purchased 22,380,815 $STARS just ten hours ago. It’s no wonder that after the post-exchange listing, crypto analyst ClayBro foresees the coin’s price doubling . The excitement surrounding $STARS is intensifying as more crypto investors look for meme coins with actual utility – especially ones that offer additional token rewards. Join the Crypto All-Stars Presale Before It’s Too Late $STARS has the potential to flourish in the meme coin space thanks to its novel staking platform, which offers distinct reward and burning mechanisms. You can easily buy $STARS before its price likely jumps. Head to the official Crypto All-Stars presale website, connect your crypto wallet, and buy $STARS using $ETH, $USDT, $BNB, or fiat. Once doing so, you’ll gain early access to the first-of-its-kind MemeVault and can stake $STARS for 151% rewards.

Is it now time for the memes to bounce? What are the best price levels to pick up $DOGE, $PEPE, and $WIF? Time to take a position in $DOGE? Source: TradingView The $DOGE price is in an ascending channel on the daily time frame. Having just touched the bottom of the channel, and currently sitting on some good horizontal support, this could be the time to take a position. If the price does bounce from here, the top of the channel is at around $0.50. A breakout of the top of the channel, with confirmation above, could lead to a measured move of at least $0.60, depending on where the breakout occurs. If, on the other hand, the price falls through the bottom of the channel, and makes a lower low, the uptrend would be negated and it would be back to the drawing board once again. That said, a continuation of the trend seems more likely. $PEPE retests - now the bounce? Source: TradingView $PEPE has been in a local downtrend for the past nine days now, and the price has almost come down to retest the top of the bull flag. The price has retested the 0.618 Fibonacci, and there is the potential for a wick to come down and retest the bull flag trendline, and also the 0.786 Fibonacci. Source: TradingView With the main trend still very much to the upside, it would not be expected that the price breaks back inside of the bull flag, although if it did, a price below $0.00001730 would make a lower low. That said, this level is very good support, as can be seen in the chart above. $WIF at very strong support Source: TradingView $WIF does look primed for a bounce here. The price has come all the way down to the deepest Fibonacci level for this move at the 0.786, which also happens to be a very strong horizontal support level. If the price did wick through, the ascending trendline, as well as the descending trendline from the all-time high, would act as good support. In conclusion, all three of the above memecoins look as though they are ready for a bounce. As usual, much will depend on Bitcoin. The $BTC price will either have to go up, or remain relatively stable for a while. Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

Everyone's buzzing about the likelihood of another rate cut that will supposedly galvanize risk-taking in the economy and financial markets. Here's the twist: The central bank is expected to signal three rate cuts for 2025, not the four it projected in September, as well as revise growth and inflation forecasts higher. No surprise, then, that bitcoin and ether are trading nearly 2% lower, driving bigger losses in small-cap tokens. Among them, Pudgy Penguins' PENGU token , which has slumped over 50% since Tuesday's airdrop. The front-end call premiums in both BTC and ETH have already taken a hit , signalling a more cautious vibe in the market. Traditional markets are also factoring in a hawkish cut. Now, seasoned traders will tell you that when expectations lean too heavily one way, there's always room for disappointment. Put more simply, if interest rate projections stay the same or Fed Chairman Jerome Powell eases concerns about sticky inflation during his press conference while maintaining a data-dependent approach, we could see a nice bump in risk assets — cryptos included. VIRTUAL, the native coin of AI and tokenization platform Virtuals Protocol, might shine in that case, having risen 11% in Asian hours. ""AI within crypto is shaping up to be a fascinating trend, especially in social trading, where data-driven insights and automation can empower traders,"" said Neal Wen, head of global business development at Kronos Research. Leading on-chain perpetuals platform HyperLiquid's HYPE token is another candidate, trading 4% higher at press time. Social media chatter points to limited exchange availability and token retention as a catalyst for the rally. That said, don't let your guard down. Some observers say the pace of future rate cuts really hinges on Friday's core PCE data, the Fed's preferred inflation measure. As Valentin Fournier, an analyst at BRN, put it: ""The Federal Reserve is set to announce a 25 basis-point interest-rate cut today — it's last for the year. Future cuts may rely heavily on Friday's Core PCE report, which is expected to hold steady at 3.3% year over year. Any surprises with rising inflation could rattle the markets, especially since bitcoin is already feeling some bearish pressure and is lacking the upward momentum."" Additionally, the decline in Chinese government bond yields has folks over at the Wall Street Journal raising red flags about the world's second-largest economy facing a depression, a prolonged period marked by a sharp drop in economic growth and rising unemployment. These concerns could easily destabilize global markets, so it's definitely a good time to stay alert.

The token of the Pudgy Penguins ecosystem token debuted amid massive hype on Tuesday. Its charm was its association with an already popular NFT collection, leading to a frenzy of buying with hopes of quick gains. But the token had garnered the necessary liquidity at launch, meaning early, enthusiastic buyers bought the token at a $5 trillion market capitalization. Liquidity is the ability to buy or sell an asset without causing a significant price change. For PENGU, the initial liquidity pools were shallow, meaning there weren't enough buyers and sellers to keep the price stable. One unlucky trader lost big on the airdrop, turning $10,000 into less than $5 in seconds. Just before the official airdrop, they had swapped 45 wrapped Solana for PENGU but got only 78 tokens due to a glitch in Jupiter's decentralized exchange. The trade was sent to a low-liquidity pool on Raydium, inflating the token's price to an unrealistic $14 trillion market cap. This mishap was due to low liquidity, where even small trades can cause huge price swings. The PENGU token was created weeks before its launch, leading to premature trading and significant losses for those who jumped in too early without checking the market cap. Derivatives Positioning Positioning in BTC futures is heating up, with open interest approaching the November high of 663.71K BTC. Meanwhile, ETH open interest has hit a record of over 339K ETH. Funding rates in perpetuals tied to major coins are holding steady at around an annualized 10%, bang in the middle of the -200% to 200% range, which marks the extremes for bearish and bullish sentiment.

However, crypto expert Alex Kolicich reveals why MSTR may not be the best way to gain Bitcoin exposure. Let’s understand his insights! Prime Misconception About MSTR The price of MSTR remains at $386.42. In the last 30 days, the market has experienced a surge of over 10.96%. Portraying MicroStrategy as an overpriced entry point into Bitcoin, Alex argues that it trades at a 140% premium to its NAV. There is so much misinformation out there about $MSTR It isn’t a “synthetic call” on bitcoin, nor is it even a leveraged way of buying Bitcoin. It’s a poorly structured, tax-inefficient fund that trades at a 140% premium to NAV A thread: — Alex Kolicich (@AlexKolicich) December 16, 2024 Bitcoin Exposure and Pricing Issues MicroStrategy holds at least 439,002 BTC, worth at least $45,782,223,524, which is around 2.09% of the total supply of Bitcoin. This translates to around $177.60 in NAV per share of Bitcoin. The crypto expert notes that the MicoStrategy market provides less than $0.45 in Bitcoin exposure for every $1 spent on it. He criticises that instead of offering more exposure, MicroStrategy offers less Bitcoin exposure than buying BTC directly. MicroStrategy Is Not Leveraged or Long Volatility The expert points out that when MSTR issues convertible debt, it effectively shorts volatility by selling a bond and a call option. He adds that unlike call options, MicroStrategy does not provide leverage on invested dollars. Shareholder Dilution Alex emphasises that rising BTC prices trigger convertible debt, resulting in dilution of the Bitcoin exposure of the shareholders of MicroStrategy. Structural Issues with MicroStrategy Emphasising the fact that MicroStrategy is a C-Corp, and explaining how the structure of MSTR is different from ETFs, the crypto expert points out that the gains of a C-Corp are generally subject to double taxation (corporate and personal taxes). Better Alternatives for Bitcoin Exposure Projecting BITX as a more efficient and cost-effective alternative to MSTR, the expert claims that products like BITX offer 2x leveraged Bitcoin exposure without trading at a premium to NAV. In conclusion, investors should critically evaluate MSTR before jumping in. With its tax inefficiency, premium pricing, and limited Bitcoin exposure, better alternatives like BITX might offer smarter and more profitable ways to invest in BTC.",News|Bitcoin,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|REGULATION|TRADING,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2024-12-18 12:00:19

The analyst drew similarities between the current price and that of 2023 while revealing what could happen next for the flagship crypto. What Next As Bitcoin Price Mirrors 2023 Move In an X post, Charting Guy revealed that the Bitcoin price is still following 2023. The analyst predicted that the flagship crypto could hit the $110,000 to $120,000 area on this leg up, with this surge expected to happen later this week or early next week. Bitcoin looks to already be on its way to this price target, having recently hit a new ATH at $108,000. Related Reading: Analyst Who Correctly Predicted The Fantom Breakout Above $1 Reveals What’s Next In The Parabolic Trend Charting Guy also predicted that the Bitcoin price would tap the resistance on the daily Relative Strength Index (RSI), forming a triple bearish divergence, marking a slight local top for the flagship crypto. Once that happens, the analyst believes that Bitcoin will consolidate between $105 and $115,000 for a few weeks. The Bitcoin price could then record a fakeout move up to the $125,000 to $130,000 range into Donald Trump’s inauguration with a quick dump afterwards. Charting Guy predicts that this dump could maybe lead to a final retest of the $100,000 psychological level. Once that is done, Bitcoin could then begin the final leg up, starting from mid-February to the 1.618 Fibonacci level at around $170,000. The analyst opined that this could mark the final cycle top. What Happens As BTC Consolidates As the Bitcoin price consolidates from around Christmas to Donald Trump’s inauguration, Charting Guy believes that altcoins will go “absolutely insane.” The analyst also predicts that these altcoins will witness another parabolic rally roughly one month after Bitcoin tops in late March. Related Reading: Ethereum Price Crash Incoming? Tron’s Justin Sun Unstakes $209 Million ETH From Lido Finance These altcoins are expected to rally higher while the Bitcoin price makes lower highs. Charting Guy noted that different altcoins could top at different times. Some could happen at the start of next year, some during the Inauguration, and others when BTC tops in March or possibly extend to April. The analyst is confident that all these altcoins will get a major top in the first quarter of next year, with an extension to April possible for some coins. Charting Guy stated that the exact top for these altcoins will depend on each altcoin and its chart structure, wave count, Fibonacci levels, and other technical indicators. Specifically, the analyst highlighted LINK and XRP, stating that both coins could have their wave 3 topping in early Q1, with a wave 4 correction into the summer and a fifth wave higher high into August and September. The analyst added that the fifth wave isn’t really guaranteed and is speculative.

The company’s stock options reportedly showed up on several brokerage accounts. Despite the continued speculation, Semler Scientific has not made any official announcement to confirm the news. The company aims to increase investors’ investment options through trading SMLR stock options. Semler Scientific chairman Eric Semler revealed in a December 5 press release that the company had requested options exchanges to approve trading options as it met the requirements. Options trading gives investors the right to buy or sell a stock before a given time at a specific price. A company’s shares must reach a price of between $3 and $5, record 500,000 to 1 million shares daily trading volume, and a project with a market cap of $75 million and above to be eligible for options trading. According to Nasdaq data, SMLR is trading at $74.41 at the time of writing. At the previous close, Semler Scientific’s market capitalization stood at $557 million. The data further indicated that the company’s average trading volume was slightly above $1 million. Semler Scientific shares have grown significantly this year The company’s shares have soared this year after Semler Scientific adopted a Bitcoin reserve strategy in May. According to Google Finance data from May 28, the SMLR stock spiked by over 30%, reaching $30.38. The company’s shares have increased by over 39% since then. Chairman Semler explained that its strategy and increased BTC purchases would create a store of value for the company. The chairman further argued that BTC would present a compelling investment among shareholders. The medical technology firm pointed out Bitcoin’s finite supply, which increases its scarcity. The chairman highlighted that the coin’s characteristics placed it at a vantage point as a hedge against inflation and a safe haven in case of global economic instability. Semler further mentioned that the company weighed other alternatives before settling on BTC as the right option. Since then, Semler Scientific has accumulated 2084 BTC, with the latest purchase being on December 16. The company bought 211 BTC worth approximately $21.5 million at about $101,890 per BTC. According to Semler, the investment has attained a BTC Yield of 67% quarter-to-date and 92.8% since the adoption of the Bitcoin Treasury in May. The company’s Bitcoin strategy is similar to MicroStrategy, with some referring to Semler Scientific as “MicroStrategy II.” Other companies, including Mara Holdings and Riot Platforms, have also joined the BTC accumulation trend. Second prospectus supplement filing SMLR announced a $150M shelf offering when their MCAP was only $200M.. I think the next one will be >$500M and coming very soon — THE BITCOIN PHARAOH (@thebtcpharaoh) December 17, 2024 The medical technology company filed for a second prospectus supplement with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission on December 16 to offer $50 million in shares to its at-the-market (ATM) program with Cantor. The company’s registration statement for the ATM program under the S-3 Shelf was in August. Semler also indicated in the filing that the ATM offering has generated $100 million from the sale of over 1.9 million shares of its common stock since the registration. The addition would push the amount under the ATM to $150 million. The company’s boost of funds under the ATM increases the amount Semler Scientific has dedicated toward more BTC purchases.

Arthur Hayes Predicts Crypto Market Volatility During Trump's 2025 Inauguration Hayes expressed his concerns in a social media post, suggesting that this incident could trigger a “regrettable dump” in crypto markets. Hayes said he plans to adjust his investment strategy to mitigate potential losses, including reducing certain positions ahead of the expected volatility. It also stated its intention to repurchase underlying positions at lower prices in the first half of 2025. Despite speculation about a possible US national Bitcoin reserve under Trump’s administration, Hayes downplayed the possibility of such a development, saying, “I don’t think national Bitcoin reserves are going to happen.” Hayes’ prediction comes at a time when crypto markets continue to respond to macroeconomic events, regulatory developments, and political shifts, underscoring the impact of global events on digital assets. Hayes' comments have raised a number of concerns and curiosity among market participants regarding potential price movements in the coming months. *This is not investment advice.

At a legislative council meeting on Dec. 18, Christopher Hui, Hong Kong’s Secretary for Financial Services and the Treasury, presented a stablecoin bill in its second reading. In light of fiat stablecoin issuers’ increasing significance in the financial sector, the law aims to provide a legal framework for them. The suggested regulation requires stablecoin issuers to have reserves equivalent to the value of circulating stablecoins, made out of liquid, high-quality assets. The right to redeem stablecoins at face value without exorbitant fees or delays would also be ensured for holders. The framework also incorporates strict risk management procedures, disclosure requirements, and anti-money laundering safeguards. You might also like: What are stablecoins and how do they work? The Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) would have the power to license stablecoin issuers, keep an eye on compliance, and look into infractions to guarantee monitoring. Widespread support for the bill during last year’s public consultation strengthened Hong Kong’s resolve to regulate virtual assets sensibly and by international norms. Hui also mentioned in his speech that, “fiat stablecoins have the potential to develop into a generally accepted medium of payment, thus posting a more urgent risk to monetary and financial stability.” He explained that the rapid adoption of stablecoins if left unchecked, could disrupt traditional financial systems, undermine monetary policies, and create vulnerabilities due to their reliance on private entities for issuance and reserves. These concerns are amplified by the growing significance of stablecoins , which have reached a market capitalization of $220 billion at the time of writing. Leading the market are issuers like Tether , with a market capitalization of $142 billion, and Circle’s USDC , valued at $42 billion. While these assets provide stability in a notoriously volatile market, their size and reliance on centralized issuers pose systemic risks. Hui’s concerns highlight that such large-scale reliance on private entities for issuance and reserve management could disrupt financial stability, particularly if reserves are mismanaged or redemption guarantees are not met during periods of economic stress. This urgency for regulation is further emphasized by Hong Kong’s efforts to distinguish its digital asset framework from the stringent cryptocurrency restrictions in Mainland China. The stringent cryptocurrency regulations in Mainland China stand in stark contrast to the Hong Kong plan. While China focuses on its central bank digital currency , the digital yuan, Hong Kong’s regulatory framework seeks to provide clarity and oversight to private issuers like Tether and Circle. Hong Kong is working to promote a more diverse digital asset ecosystem, while China has outlawed the majority of private cryptocurrency activity. By implementing these steps, Hong Kong aims to close the gap between established financial systems and the emerging digital asset market by implementing these steps. Clarity in regulations may help draw Web3 innovators and stablecoin issuers looking for a stable and safe working environment.

It will also provide Indian blockchain companies with easy entry into the UAE market through RAK DAO’s ecosystem of over 400 companies, in addition to its legal and regulatory framework. On the other hand, IBA’s extensive network and domain knowledge of the blockchain landscape in India has over 115 million crypto users, and a booming startup ecosystem will be available for UAE-based companies. IBA’s founder, Mr. Raj Kapoor , says the company is trying to bridge the environmental , social, and governance deficit on blockchain, encouraging sustainable practices and responsible innovation. Their emphasis on transparency and decentralized governance harmonizes developments in the blockchain industry with ESG requirements, providing ethical and sustainable growth. In a direct message to crypto.news, Kapoor said: “We are observing how such frameworks are leveraged, their impact, and how these best practices could be adopted at a national level. This partnership aims to foster meaningful policy transformation back home.” Kapoor emphasized the need to optimize existing structures, consume less energy for blockchain work, and make sure technological advances are in line with sustainability goals. He noted that innovative technologies like blockchain contribute toward transparency and ethically sourced products in industries like agriculture, fashion, and electronics. This allows strict adherence to ESG regulations to be tracked in real time with blockchain-based certificates.

By providing a conducive environment for entrepreneurs , the zones have contributed to the diversification of the economy, with 40+ free zones operating in the region. The Web3 ecosystem has a very strong regulatory framework in RAK DAO, unlike India where regulatory ambiguity has stifled progress in blockchain technology’s growth. It thus reduces operational hurdles, enabling innovators to focus on solutions rather than compliance, says Kapoor. Kapoor also hopes this partnership can provide Indian Web3 startups to access funding from international investors. The ambient for the free zones with common law frameworks like RAK DAO are a cornerstone for blockchain. Common law creates legal certainty, investor protection, and familiar dispute resolution mechanisms with global reach, which are foundational to every decentralized technology. The stability of regulatory principles also attracts blockchain companies that need predictable, clear regulations to expand innovations and build trust across the global markets.
