After reaching an all-time high (ATH) on November 22, Solana has experienced a 23% retracement, testing investor confidence. However, analysts remain optimistic, with many expecting a significant upward move in the coming weeks. Related Reading: Ethereum Forming A Symmetrical Pattern – Key Resistance At $4,100 Renowned analyst Jelle recently shared a technical analysis highlighting Solana’s strong potential. According to Jelle, the monthly chart for SOL is primed for an “absolute monster run,” indicating that the current consolidation phase may be laying the groundwork for a powerful breakout. This view aligns with the broader sentiment that Solana’s resilience above $210 could act as a springboard for the next phase of its rally. As one of the leading altcoins in the crypto market, Solana has attracted attention for its robust performance and potential to lead the next leg of the bull market. With the price now consolidating after a sharp pullback, all eyes are on SOL’s ability to maintain its critical support and reclaim momentum. Whether Solana can deliver on its bullish promise will be a key focus for traders and investors alike in the coming weeks. Solana Holds Key Demand Solana is currently trading above a critical level for this cycle—the $210 mark. This price point, which previously acted as a significant resistance, has now flipped into a vital support level, setting the stage for Solana’s next potential rally. The importance of this level cannot be overstated, as it represents a key area where buyers are stepping in to defend SOL’s bullish momentum. Renowned analyst Jelle recently shared a compelling technical analysis on X, emphasizing Solana’s strong outlook. According to Jelle, Solana’s monthly chart is primed for what he described as an “absolute monster run.” His analysis highlights how SOL’s price is now testing its 2021 all-time high (ATH) as support, a critical juncture that could determine its trajectory in the weeks to come. Jelle’s simple yet powerful chart indicates that if Solana manages to push decisively above the $210 level, it will confirm the strength of this support and potentially trigger a massive bull run. This rally could result in impressive gains for SOL, positioning it as a standout performer in the crypto market. Related Reading: Bitcoin Breaks ATH Pushing Back Into Price Discovery – BTC To $130K? For now, all eyes are on Solana’s ability to sustain its momentum and break higher. As it consolidates above this essential level, traders and investors are closely monitoring its next moves, anticipating the possibility of a historic price surge. Price Action Suggests A Big Move Soon Solana is trading at $221, maintaining its strength above the critical $210 support level. This resilience has bolstered confidence among investors, as SOL’s price action aligns bullishly across all time frames. Solana is gearing up for a major rally, but it must first overcome the $245 resistance level to confirm the uptrend. Market dynamics indicate that SOL is in a prime position for upward momentum. Unlike other assets that may show signs of hesitation or potential consolidation, Solana exhibits a well-defined price structure that strongly favors a breakout. The lack of bearish signals further solidifies this outlook, as there is little indication of an imminent correction or prolonged sideways trading.

If SOL successfully breaches the $245 resistance with strength, it could trigger a wave of buying pressure, propelling the price to new heights.

The stock’s been on a tear, climbing 40% since the U.S. presidential election. At $476.73, Tesla’s market cap now sits at a jaw-dropping $1.53 trillion. Compare that to Nvidia—last year’s golden child of growth stocks—sitting at $129.92 with a market cap of $318 billion. Analysts aren’t missing a beat. Tesla and Nvidia are two sides of the same coin: both are fueled by a tech future that seems unstoppable. Tesla has cars and autonomous tech; Nvidia has chips and AI infrastructure. One builds the machine, the other runs the software. Yet while Nvidia’s growth is starting to cool, Tesla’s numbers keep pulling investors in. Tesla’s 52-week range speaks volumes: it’s climbed from $138.80 all the way to $483.99 this year. Nvidia has moved between $47.32 and $152.89, a solid performance but far from Tesla’s high-octane climb. Why Wall Street’s watching Tesla like it watched Nvidia Cathie Wood, CEO of Ark Invest, says she sees Tesla hitting $2,600 by 2029, driven by what she calls “unmatched growth” in profits and revenues. If Wood’s predictions play out, Tesla could hit an enterprise value of $8.2 trillion in just five years. That makes Nvidia’s peak look tame by comparison. Investors are biting. The excitement is Tesla’s move toward AI-powered autonomous driving. It’s no secret Tesla isn’t just an electric car company anymore. Self-driving software and its robotaxi ambitions have Wall Street betting on a future Tesla that doesn’t just sell cars—it sells rides, powered by AI. Tesla’s strategy echoes Nvidia’s dominance during the AI boom. Nvidia’s chips became essential to generative AI development, fueling companies like OpenAI and driving profits to record highs. Tesla’s AI, on the other hand, lives on the roads. If it perfects autonomous driving, its software will become as essential as Nvidia’s chips. But there’s a catch. Tesla trades at a staggering price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 162. Nvidia’s ratio? A much more palatable 51.14. That makes Tesla a high-risk, high-reward bet. Goldman Sachs recently pointed this out, cautioning that Tesla’s valuation may be running ahead of its earnings. Nvidia’s growth is slowing, Tesla’s just getting started Nvidia is still the face of AI infrastructure, but the cracks are showing. After growing revenue by over 200% in recent quarters, analysts now expect Nvidia’s growth to slow to around 70%. Still impressive, but a clear sign that the AI boom is leveling out. Nvidia’s reliance on a handful of mega clients—like cloud giants and AI startups—has some investors worried. Tesla, meanwhile, is all momentum. The market sees a company that’s just scratching the surface of its AI potential. Self-driving cars are Tesla’s big bet. The trading data backs this up. Tesla has been gaining traction as one of Wall Street’s most traded stocks. Nvidia still holds the crown, with 197 million shares traded on December 17 compared to Tesla’s 108 million. Investors go all in on US stocks The bullish sentiment on Tesla is part of a broader trend. Bank of America’s Global Fund Manager Survey shows investors are dumping cash and going all in on equities. Cash allocations hit their lowest point since 2001, falling from 4.3% to 3.9%. That’s a sign investors are chasing gains and aren’t interested in sitting on the sidelines. Michael Hartnett, a strategist at Bank of America, called the mood “super-bullish.” Tesla’s surge, fueled by its AI story, is a perfect fit for this environment. Wall Street sees a growth machine, and it’s hungry for more. Interest rate cuts are adding fuel to the fire. Traders expect the Federal Reserve to start cutting rates, making stocks even more attractive. The S&P 500 is on track to close 2024 up more than 26%, far beyond anyone’s expectations. Analysts now predict another 10% climb next year, with growth stocks like Tesla leading the way. Nvidia played that role in 2023. Now Tesla’s taking the baton.

Her push for a national Bitcoin reserve comes amid a historic market upsurge that has propelled the world’s largest crypto by market capitalization to new heights in recent weeks, with BTC today marking a new record high above $108,000. No To Digital Euro, Yes To Strategic BTC Reserve In a speech before the European parliament, Sarah Knafo urged European lawmakers to establish a strategic BTC reserve. Knafo declared, “It is time to protect our people from inflation and the poor economic choices of our states.” She then reiterated her statements in a post on X (aka Twitter). She also cautioned that the European Central Bank’s plans of launching a central bank digital currency could result in a “dystopian world” where transactions are monitored, and citizens are debunked for simple remarks on social media platforms. The lawmaker stated, “it is time to bet on freedom,” adding: “No to the digital euro, yes to a strategic Bitcoin reserve.” Knafo further indicated that it’s time for the ECB to stop “totalitarian temptations” by urging a shift from regulatory overreach in crypto to adopting the decentralized nature of Bitcoin. She pointed out that Europe has adopted a different approach to crypto. While the U.S. mulls a strategic, national stockpile of the top cryptocurrency, local regulators in Europe have been mostly focused on regulation, taxation, and suppressing innovation. Knafo highlighted the outstanding success of El Salvador, where President Nayib Bukele made the unpopular decision to make Bitcoin legal tender in late 2021. Bukele was harshly criticized by U.S. politicians, the World Bank, and the IMF for the move. Nonetheless, the Latin American nation’s Bitcoin experiment has paid off handsomely , garnering over $300 million in unrealized profits so far. Calls To Stockpile Bitcoin Gain Traction Around The World Knafo’s speech comes as the U.S. stance toward Bitcoin undergoes massive changes following Donald Trump’s win against Kamala Harris last month. Trump and his allies have frequently voiced their support behind legislation to create a Bitcoin strategic reserve and will soon be well-positioned to make that a reality. Several U.S. lawmakers have made pushes to establish a strategic Bitcoin reserve. Binance ex-CEO Changpeng “CZ” Zhao recently forecasted the BTC reserve policy would be imitated globally. “This also has a knock-on effect on other countries in the world. If the U.S. is doing this, then every other country will have to do this,” he posited at the Bitcoin MENA conference last week. Notably, government officials in Brazil have already submitted legislation to realize that possibility, while a Japanese lawmaker named Satoshi put forth a formal request to his nation’s legislature last week to start a discussion about developing a national Bitcoin reserve for Japan.",Bitcoin|News|Bitcoin News|El Salvador,EN,0,0,ASIA|BTC|FIAT|MARKET|REGULATION,"{'name': 'ZyCrypto', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/zycrypto.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",zycrypto,2024-12-17 22:43:57

Cynthia Lummis",https://www.cryptopolitan.com/pro-digital-asset/,"Senator Cynthia Lummis believes 2025 will be a key year for Bitcoin, with the U.S. leading in digital assets under David Sacks. She proposes a Bitcoin reserve to protect against inflation and increase the dollar value. And believes the most pro digital asset administration ever. The year 2025 is looking like a big moment for Bitcoin and digital assets, with strong administration supporting their future. Senator Cynthia Lummis from Wyoming said that 2025 will be the year Bitcoin takes off. She believes the U.S. will become the world leader in digital assets and financial innovation. The Appointment of David Sacks as “Crypto Czar” Announcements comes with the appointment of David Sacks as the “Crypto Czar. ” David Sacks is a prominent venture capitalist and one of the early PayPal executives with deep knowledge and understanding of the tech world. Sacks has advocated for Bitcoin and other digital currencies, and many in the crypto community see him as a strong figure who can help shape policies that the growth of digital assets. Senator Lummis strongly supports Sacks’ leadership and believes that the U.S. will take a leading role in digital assets under his guidance. “ Under David Sacks’ leadership, the U.S. is primed to lead the world in digital assets and financial innovation,” said Lummis. Michael Saylor also supports this vision. He shares Lummis’ excitement, saying, “Under David Sacks’ leadership, the U.S. will not only lead the world in digital assets but also set the stage for financial innovation like we’ve never seen before.” Saylor’s endorsement of Sacks shows that many influential figures in the crypto community believe that this leadership is the key to true potential of digital assets in the U.S. Lummis’ Vision on Strategic Bitcoin Reserve One of Lummis’ bold proposals is the idea of a “strategic Bitcoin reserve” and mentions ” My Strategic Reserve.” This would involve the U.S. government acquiring and holding Bitcoin as part of its financial reserves, similar to how the country holds gold today. Lummis believes that Bitcoin can serve as a store of value that will protect the U.S. from inflation, strengthen the U.S. dollar, and improve the country’s financial health. She said, “I look forward to working closely with David Sacks to pass comprehensive digital asset legislation and my strategic Bitcoin reserve.” If adopted, this idea could change how the U.S. approaches its financial reserves and set an example for other countries to follow. The strategic Bitcoin reserve is not just a theoretical idea Lummis has suggested that the U.S. could use existing gold certificates to purchase Bitcoin without affecting the balance sheet. This could save billions of dollars and make the country’s financial system more resilient. With the right leadership and support, such a proposal could be a game changer for the global economy. The idea of the U.S. government formally adopting Bitcoin into its financial strategy would greatly increase the cryptocurrency market. Some states in the U.S., like Wisconsin and Michigan, have already begun experimenting with crypto in their investment portfolios. However, if the federal government takes action and incorporates Bitcoin into its reserves, it could open the doors for even more institutional investors and major players in the global financial markets. 2025 holds much promise for Bitcoin and digital assets. With leaders like Senator Cynthia Lummis, David Sacks, and Michael Saylor working together, the U.S. is on track to become the global leader in digital assets and financial innovation.

Trump Patriot (TRUMPPAT), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 19,000% in price in the coming days. This is because TRUMPPAT is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Trump Patriot can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Trump Patriot could become the next viral memecoin. Trump Patriot launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Trump Patriot on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Trump Patriot by entering its contract address – 9hmvtogFEjzZQMFfJ5Hiq7fQSq7E38mG3Qjb7X42qM6P – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like TRUMPPAT.

Sim, previously sanctioned by OFAC, oversaw the schemes, leveraging a complex web of crypto exchanges, money mules, and shell companies. Crypto cash-outs and the UAE connection The network’s key players operated primarily out of the United Arab Emirates. Lu Huaying, a Chinese national, allegedly began converting North Korean-obscured cryptocurrency into cash in early 2022. Between then and September 2023, Lu successfully laundered millions of dollars on behalf of Sim Hyon Sop. The scheme used money mules and crypto-to-fiat conversions to disguise the funds’ origins, allowing the DPRK to purchase goods and services essential for its missile development. Zhang Jian, another Chinese national based in the UAE, stepped in later. Between late 2022 and early 2023, Zhang facilitated fiat currency exchanges for Sim and allegedly acted as a cash courier. The funds, moved through layers of intermediaries, ultimately financed North Korea’s weapons programs. Green Alpine Trading, LLC, served as the core of the operation. Registered in the UAE, the front company was integral to the laundering process, providing Sim’s network with the infrastructure to move money seamlessly across borders. OFAC said Green Alpine attempted to provide “financial, material, and technological support” for North Korea’s illicit operations. The sanctions now freeze all U.S.-linked property and financial assets tied to Lu, Zhang, and Green Alpine Trading. Any entity controlled 50% or more by the sanctioned individuals or company is also blocked. U.S. citizens and institutions are barred from engaging with the network. North Korea’s crypto laundering tactics revealed North Korea’s strategy is simple but effective: steal crypto, launder it, and cash it out through proxies . Digital assets, with their anonymity and decentralized nature, have become critical to the DPRK’s revenue generation. The regime exploits cybercrime, fraudulent IT work, and stolen funds to bypass international sanctions. Sim Hyon Sop, the architect of the UAE-based operation, represents North Korea’s Korea Kwangson Banking Corp (KKBC). KKBC is a state-run entity already blacklisted under U.S. and United Nations sanctions for its role in funding the DPRK’s WMD programs. From China, Sim directs these schemes, setting up shell companies and managing bank accounts to obscure the origin of the funds. The Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) has long pointed to individuals like Sim as key players. They work as agents for state-backed institutions, pulling strings behind the scenes while using intermediaries like Lu and Zhang to handle the dirty work. By relying on trusted proxies, Sim’s network operates across multiple jurisdictions with minimal direct involvement from Pyongyang. The scale of North Korea’s crypto operations is staggering. Since 2017, estimates show that Pyongyang has stolen over $3 billion in cryptocurrency. These funds directly finance its ballistic missile and nuclear weapons programs, fueling the regime’s military ambitions while evading traditional banking systems.

The draft was reportedly presented by @btcpolicyorg as an executive order focusing on making Bitcoin a strategic reserve asset within the Exchange Stabilization Fund (ESF). The two-page document addressed certain key points the institute recognized as important to cover in what many consider a preliminary draft. Recommendations to gain a competitive advantage with Bitcoin The executive order describes Bitcoin as a strategic reserve asset that can bolster the US dollar’s resilience. It also demands the establishment of a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve (SBR) to serve as a permanent national asset for economic security. According to the draft, the US policy should include: Creating the Bitcoin reserve to grow the economy and maintain the US’s financial dominance in world markets. Making Bitcoin a strategic asset stored by the government to diversify national reserves and boost economic security. Striving to make the US the number one country for digital assets in terms of attracting investment, talent, and innovation. The draft highlights the need for the United States to adapt to global trends in digital finance as this is the only way to maintain economic stability and leadership. It also tags Bitcoin as a decentralized and finite store-of-value asset, with comparisons to digital gold — a sentiment many crypto stakeholders seem to agree with. MicroStrategy ’s Michael Saylor has even gone as far as suggesting the US sell all its gold to buy BTC. It may sound over the top, but Micahel Saylor has overtly supported Bitcoin, and his BTC gamble has paid off exponentially. Establishment of the SBR and Bitcoin designation According to the draft, the SBR will be handled by the Treasury Department, which will have strict oversight, including audits and security measures. The draft also recommended that any Bitcoins held by federal agencies should be transferred to the SBR within 7 days of the order’s issuance. It also declared Bitcoin as a reserve asset suitable for holding within the ESF, with acquisition programs to begin within two months. According to the acquisition program, about $21 billion in Bitcoin will be bought within a year using funds from the ESF. The purchases will happen under the watchful eyes of protocols to reduce mismanagement risks. Within a month, secure custody frameworks are expected to be implemented and this could include partnerships with secure service providers. Meanwhile, it will be up to the Treasury to create stringent standards to promote long-term security, including cryptographic verifications and less reliance on third parties. On sales from the SBR and transparency According to the draft, long-term preservation will be a priority, which means that any BTC the SBR buys will be locked down for at least two decades to protect the country’s financial strength. The documents say that Bitcoin sales can only happen under exceptional circumstances (e.g., economic or security crises). Asset liquidation will also require detailed justification and presidential approval. The draft also proposed that when the sales happen, they will be done with transparency and minimal disruption. There will be a public proof of reserve and cryptographic receipt of Bitcoin holdings will be published quarterly to promote transparency. The Treasury will be expected to provide reports on performance, security, and strategic benefits of Bitcoin within the ESF. Coordination between the various government agencies, including the Treasury, Federal Reserve and Department of Defense, among others will be encouraged in alignment with national security and economic policies. This draft has not been approved or signed, but many who have seen it seem to believe it is good enough. David Bailey, the CEO of Bitcoin Magazine, shared screenshots of the draft. He also endorsed the document and mentioned that the president’s signature is the only step needed to fully implement the Bitcoin reserve. The general sentiment among crypto stakeholders is that the draft is sufficient as a framework to integrate Bitcoin into America’s national reserves. If properly done, it could also boost the country’s security, long-term economic growth, and leadership in the crypto world.

The token was given out through an airdrop to current NFT holders, attracting interest in the crypto market. In the first hour of trading, according to data from CoinMarketCap , PENGU reached a trading volume of $90 million. Pudgy Penguins PENGU Token Popularity Soaring The airdrop gave 23.5% of PENGU’s total supply to holders of Pudgy Penguins NFTs. It also set aside 22% of the token’s supply for the Solana and Ethereum communities, strengthening its presence on multiple blockchains. To support easy trading, 12.3% of the total supply is reserved for decentralized exchanges. Meanwhile, the PENGU token trades at $0.03875, a 675% increase within 24 hours. PENGU’s successful launch has made Pudgy Penguins very popular, making it the second most valuable NFT collection after CryptoPunks. This launch highlights the growing trend of adding native tokens to existing NFT projects to create larger ecosystems and improve community engagement. PENGU Tokens Soars Following CoinMarketCap Listing Penguiana, the penguin-themed meme coin on the Solana blockchain, witnessed a 70% market valuation surge after CoinMarketCap’s June listing . This significant achievement underscores growing investor confidence. It also marked a pivotal advancement in Penguiana’s journey within the cryptocurrency landscape. $PENGU has broadened its accessibility through listings on prominent decentralized exchanges such as Raydium and Birdeye. These exchanges have facilitated the token’s swift uptake and trading. As Penguiana continues to evolve, the team remains focused on enlarging its ecosystem and deepening community engagement. Safety in the NFT Industry The NFT industry has witnessed significant growth and adoption in recent years. Some digital firms have also leveraged the platform to expand their offerings. For instance, Sony, a maker of gaming consoles, has filed a patent application to move NFTs between different games and platforms. However, with NFTs’ popularity, safety worries have surfaced, especially the safety of the platform used to produce, store, and trade NFTs. Recall that one Ethereum wallet suffered massive losses after selling 500 Moonbirds NFTs . Therefore, prioritizing safety in the NFT industry is critical to protecting users’ investments, preventing hacking or theft of valuable assets, and preserving the industry’s reputation.

If adopted, this move aims to position the United States as a global leader in digital assets. It highlights Bitcoin’s role as “digital gold” and seeks to drive capital inflows, technological adoption, and financial resilience. U.S. Proposes Strategic Bitcoin Reserve Under Trump to Strengthen Economy and Safeguard Dollar The proposal stresses the need for the U.S. to adapt to the growing influence of digital assets in global finance. Bitcoin is a decentralized, finite asset that can strengthen the U.S. economy and safeguard the dollar. The order aims to diversify the ESF’s holdings and secure long-term economic stability by formally designating Bitcoin as a strategic reserve asset. JUST IN: Bitcoin Policy Institute drafts Executive Order for a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve for President Trump pic.twitter.com/bxJHZKa8Ue — Bitcoin Magazine (@BitcoinMagazine) December 17, 2024 The executive order establishes a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve (SBR) to manage Bitcoin as a permanent national asset. The Treasury Secretary would administer it, and strict measures would ensure transparency and accountability. Regular audits, advanced security protocols, and comprehensive reporting would be required to build public confidence. The order calls for consolidating all Bitcoin currently under federal control. Within seven days, agencies like the U.S. Marshal Service would be required to stop selling, auctioning, or transferring Bitcoin. Once legal ownership is confirmed, those holdings would move to the Strategic Bitcoin Reserve. Additionally, the Treasury Secretary would have 60 days to implement an acquisition program to purchase and manage Bitcoin under the ESF. Trump’s Bitcoin Reserve Plan: Will Seized BTC Kickstart a New Financial Era? Bitcoin surged to a record high above $107,000 on Monday after President-elect Donald Trump reaffirmed plans to establish a U.S. bitcoin strategic reserve, igniting enthusiasm among crypto supporters. A strategic reserve is a stockpile of critical resources to stabilize markets during crises. Examples include the U.S. Strategic Petroleum Reserve and China’s reserves of metals and grains. Analysts are divided on whether Trump could create the reserve through an executive order or if Congress must act. Trump hinted the reserve could start with 200,000 seized bitcoins, currently worth around $21 billion. Adding more would require government purchases, potentially funded through debt issuance or selling gold reserves. Senator Cynthia Lummis has proposed legislation for the Treasury to purchase 200,000 BTC annually for five years , funded by Federal Reserve profits and gold holdings. Supporters argue a Bitcoin reserve could help dominate the global market, reduce deficits, and strengthen the U.S. dollar.

Qubetics Is the Best Crypto to Invest in 2024!,https://thecoinrise.com/cardano-left-you-behind-qubetics-is-the-best-crypto-to-invest-in-2024/,"The cryptocurrency market is filled with opportunities, but it’s also easy to miss out. Cardano, one of the most recognised names in crypto, delivered impressive growth for early investors. But if you’re still waiting for the next big thing, it’s time to turn your attention to Qubetics ($TICS) . With an affordable presale price and outstanding real-world applications, Qubetics is quickly becoming the best crypto to invest in 2024. Let’s dive into how Qubetics and Cardano compare and why Qubetics might be the best opportunity to watch this year. Qubetics ($TICS): A Practical Solution with Impressive Returns Qubetics is not just another cryptocurrency looking to make a splash. As the world’s first Web3 aggregator , Qubetics connects real-world businesses and individuals to blockchain technology through efficient, user-friendly solutions. At its core lies an innovative approach to solve global challenges, particularly in secure digital communications and decentralised transactions. Currently, Qubetics is in its 13th presale stage, with tokens priced at just $0.0342. So far, over 350 million tokens have been sold to more than 10,300 holders, raising $6.9 million. These numbers alone make Qubetics one of the best cryptos to invest in 2024, offering massive upside potential for early investors. If you invest $8,500 in Qubetics at $0.0342 per token, analysts predict significant gains. By the end of the presale, when $TICS reaches $0.25, your investment could grow by 630.19% ROI. If the token hits $1 post-presale, that translates to a 2,820.78% ROI. Should Qubetics reach $15 after its mainnet launch, your initial investment could rise to a jaw-dropping $3.7 million. One of Qubetics’ standout features is its decentralised VPN (dVPN). The dVPN ensures privacy and security in an age where digital surveillance is rampant. For professionals like doctors, lawyers, and entrepreneurs, Qubetics’ dVPN offers a private way to manage confidential transactions and sensitive data securely. For individuals, it means safer browsing, enhanced online privacy, and greater control over personal information. With growing concerns about cybersecurity, Qubetics’ dVPN has become a game-changer for both individuals and businesses. This unique blend of practical use cases and investor potential is why Qubetics has earned its place as the best crypto to invest in 2024. By solving real-world problems and bridging the gap between Web3 and traditional industries, Qubetics offers far more than just speculation. It’s a utility-driven investment for the future. Cardano (ADA): A Steady Leader in Blockchain Cardano is one of the most respected projects in the cryptocurrency space. Known for its academic approach to blockchain development, Cardano prioritises security, scalability, and sustainability. It has created a robust ecosystem designed to handle decentralised finance (DeFi), smart contracts, and real-world enterprise solutions. In 2024, Cardano continues to expand its ecosystem. The recent updates to its smart contract platform have improved efficiency and lowered transaction fees. With increased adoption of decentralised applications (dApps), Cardano has attracted developers and businesses seeking secure blockchain solutions. Despite its steady growth, Cardano’s price has remained relatively stable, with analysts predicting modest gains for 2024. While its ecosystem remains robust, its growth rate no longer matches the potential seen in emerging projects like Qubetics. Investors looking for exponential returns may find Qubetics’ presale more appealing than Cardano’s current market position. Conclusion: Qubetics is the Best Crypto to Invest in 2024 If you missed Cardano’s early success, now is your chance to seize a new opportunity. Qubetics ($TICS) is rapidly emerging as the best crypto to invest in 2024, offering affordable entry points, real-world applications like dVPN, and extraordinary ROI potential. With its 13th presale stage still ongoing and tokens priced at $0.0342, Qubetics combines practical blockchain solutions with an investment opportunity that could deliver life-changing returns. For investors seeking the next big winner, Qubetics delivers unmatched potential to outperform established projects like Cardano.

Recent market demand showed renewed spot open interest, as BTC grew to over $108,300, a new price record. Bitcoin (BTC) rallied to its most recent price record as market sentiment shifted to increased spot demand. Analysts noted since October, market influences depended on spot trading, rather than being driven by the derivative market. During earlier bull market stages, open interest on derivative positions was higher, while spot trading and flows to exchanges were slow. In the last quarter of 2024, the BTC Fund Flow Ratio increased its baseline, suggesting a higher inflow of funds to and from exchanges. The BTC fund flow ratio suggest spot exchange activity increased in the last quarter of 2024. | Source: Cryptoquant The fund flow ratio is a metric of on-chain BTC transfers against transfers to exchanges. A more active exchange flow means the focus shifted to spot trading. In the past quarter of 2024, both derivatives and spot trading accelerated. However, as the year comes to a close, spot activity is growing more dominant. Derivative open interest for BTC on major centralized exchanges stalled at around $33B, sinking slightly from its peak. The BTC derivative market goes through cycles of accumulation and liquidation of leveraged positions. Those cycles often boost the price to a new range, causing the liquidation of short positions. With time, interest shifts to additional accumulation on the spot market. Leveraged position accumulation and liquidation cycles are happening at lower levels, without causing significant drawdown events. At the same time, BTC traders often use the spot market to realize short-term gains and reaccumulate. The behavior of short-term trader whales also goes against retail sentiment. As BTC trades above $106,000, retail is bullish, while smart money has turned bearish. Overall, trading behavior shifted the Bitcoin fear and greed index to the ‘extreme greed’ level at 87 points. Demand for actual BTC reserves is rising Demand is rising for owning and controlling BTC in the form of long-term reserves. Instead of leveraged positions, bets on the value of BTC are made by storing coins that are instantly accessible. Demand for physical coins and spot trading led to an increase in the Coinbase premium index . The index has been in the green for most of the past 30-day period. The Coinbase premium index is showing higher demand for spot BTC buying on the US dollar market. The index measures BTC prices on Coinbase against the Binance market, suggesting increased demand for direct buying. Spot trading for BTC also expanded the share of US dollar trading. More than 21% of all BTC volumes are against the US dollar, diminishing the role of stablecoins. Despite the expansion of stablecoins, the dollar-based spot market indicates a shift to direct BTC demand. BTC keeps moving into whale wallets The other major sources for BTC holding are miners, who still own 1.9M coins. ETF buying is also ongoing, retaining even more coins through Coinbase Custody. The third biggest source of demand for BTC comes from corporate buyers, who are buying BTC through new bond issues. This source is also the biggest shift from fiat to crypto ownership, betting on long-term BTC growth. Demand from Bitcoin ETF absorbs most of the physical selling pressure. As older cohorts of holders realize profits, Bitcoin ETF absorbs up to 90% of that selling pressure. Even large-scale whales have easily found liquidity on the market. Demand from MicroStrategy, MARA Holdings, and other corporate buyers is also a significant drain on available coins. Demand far outpaces daily BTC production of just 450 new coins. The current conditions with actual transfers of coins to even larger whale wallets are expected to create a supply crunch. Based on the Rainbow chart , BTC is still in the accumulation zone and possibly far from the cycle top. The next potential levels see BTC test $110,000 and a peak above $125,000.

Salesforce plans to hire 2,000 new salespeople to focus on selling artificial intelligence (AI) products as the company planning to expand its AI offerings. Salesforce to Hire 2,000 Salespeople for AI Expansion CEO Marc Benioff made this announcement during a company event in San Francisco on Tuesday, saying that the demand for AI tools is so high that the company is increasing its hiring plans. “We’re adding another couple of thousand salespeople to help sell these products,” Benioff said. “ We already had 9,000 referrals for the 2,000 positions we’ve opened. It’s amazing.” This announcement makes a big increase from the initial plan. A month ago, Benioff mentioned that Salesforce would hire 1,000 new salespeople for AI roles. The company is now doubling the count as it prepares to release its new AI agent software in February 2025. Salesforce aims to make AI a key part of its product lineup, with AI tools to help sales teams, marketers, and customer service agents do their jobs more efficiently. The new salespeople will help introduce and sell Salesforce’s latest AI technology, including the upcoming second version of its Agentforce platform. This software is designed to create AI-powered agents to handle complex tasks, like answering questions in Salesforce’s Slack app using all available data. The new AI agents will be able to respond to customer queries, making business operations smoother and faster. Benioff is very excited about Salesforce’s potential for AI. In a recent interview, he shared, “I’ve never been more excited about anything at Salesforce, maybe in my career.” He added that he expects the company to have over a billion AI agents within the next year. “This is the most exciting thing that’s happened to Salesforce,” he said. Salesforce’s AI Push Following 2022 Layoffs Salesforce’s move into AI comes after the company laid off over 7,000 employees in 2022. Cutting over 7,000 jobs to adjust to changing economic conditions. As of January 2024, Salesforce had 72,682 employees. Now, the company is focused on hiring more people to increase growth in the AI space. With its new AI agents and expanded sales team, Salesforce is aiming to become a major player in the AI industry.

Coinbase asked a U.S. court to deny BiT Global’s lawsuit in Northern California, which seeks $1 billion in relief and a temporary restraining order on wrapped Bitcoin’s ( wBTC )’s delisting. The Justin Sun-affiliated BiT Global sued Coinbase on Dec. 13 for planning to remove the wrapped Bitcoin ( BTC ) asset from its U.S.-based exchange. BiT Global claimed delisting wBTC was illegal, would cause irreparable harm to the token’s economics, and was unjustified as Coinbase listed unserious cryptocurrencies like meme coins. Also, launching cbBTC breached antitrust laws and threatened to create a Coinbase-controlled monopoly in the tokenized Bitcoin marketplace. The crypto exchange argued that California’s Unfair Competition Law was inapplicable. DefiLlama confirmed that cbBTC ranked outside the top 10 tokenized BTC assets by market capitalization. Coinbase has the right to choose whom to do business with, and no law requires it to allow bad actors or suspected bad actors onto its exchange… Coinbase does not have anything approaching monopoly power, and because its decision to delist wBTC was proper and justified based on the careful review it undertook and the unacceptable risk of doing business with an entity associated with Mr. Sun. Coinbase response to BiT Global lawsuit According to the December 17 court filing, material changes to wBTC’s stewardship, particularly Justin Sun’s majority control of the Bitcoin reserves, prompted Coinbase and other entities to reconsider their support for the asset. You might also like: Sky mulls cutting support for wBTC over Justin Sun affiliations The Securities and Exchange Commission charged Sun and three of his wholly owned companies with federal violations. Additionally, the FBI reportedly opened an inquiry regarding potential terror financing involving Sun. The U.S. Department of Justice has not indicted Sun by publishing time, neither have authorities issued any arrest warrants for the Tron ( TRX ) founder. Coinbase stated that its new wBTC risk assessments, in line with company listing standards, raised red flags, primarily due to Sun’s involvement. The exchange described its decision as “common sense” and necessary to protect its customers. The company also emphasized that delisting wBTC would not impact the token’s overall on-chain activity, which largely takes place on other platforms. Nor can BiT claim harm, let alone irreparable harm, from being delisted from an exchange where less than 1% of transactions involving wBTC are made. Perhaps that is why BiT sat on its claims for nearly a month before filing suit, belying any urgency for relief. The U.S. crypto titan asked the California Court to rule against BiT Global’s TRO request and $1 billion relief package, due to the firm’s ties to an allegedly indictable individual and fabricated emergency regarding wBTC. We've filed our response to BiT Global’s effort to stop our delisting of wBTC before any discovery or even formal response to their bogus claims. We lay out why this lawsuit lacks any semblance of merit and why their request for a TRO should be denied.

Japan is famous for its strict regulation of both the crypto and gaming sectors. Critics, however, say that a “lack of clarity regarding legal regulations, accounting, and taxation issues” have thus far held Japanese firms back from developing blockchain gaming titles.

A French magistrate and member of the Cour des Comptes, Knafo’s background includes public service and political advising, most notably for right-wing Jewish presidential candidate Éric Zemmour. Knafo’s public role has steadily risen since her election to the European Parliament in 2024. Why The EU Needs A Strategic Bitcoin Reserve In her speech on the Parliament floor, Knafo drew upon global examples—citing El Salvador’s early adoption of Bitcoin and political figures such as former US President Donald Trump and Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell—to underscore a rising wave of institutional acceptance. She asserted that the EU’s current financial strategies put member states at a disadvantage within what she characterized as a rapidly evolving monetary landscape. “Already 3 years ago, on the other side of the Atlantic, the president of El Salvador decided to invest for his country in crypto-currencies,” said Knafo, referencing El Salvador’s 2021 legal tender law. “At the time, he was reviled by the political class and the IMF. Today, he’s up 100%.” Emphasizing a perceived missed opportunity for EU nations, Knafo argued that El Salvador’s move has yielded significant capital gains—resources that, she said, the country has used to bolster both “the security and sovereignty of his country.” Turning to the United States, she acknowledged that “Donald Trump will establish a strategic Bitcoin reserve for the United States.”. Knafo also invoked the public stance of Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell , stating that “Jerome Powell is now talking about it as ‘digital gold.’” She positioned these developments as signs that other major economies are adapting to decentralized finance, while “the European Union […] continues to accumulate tragically inflationary deficits,” with existing regulatory measures that she criticized as overly restrictive. “We don’t want this dystopian world,” Knafo warned, referencing the European Central Bank’s work on a digital euro . “Where tomorrow a European bureaucrat will be able to prohibit us from certain transactions and even eliminate us from the banking system at the click of a button for something we say on social networks.” Throughout her address, Knafo appealed for a wholesale shift in EU financial policy: “It’s time to say no to the totalitarian temptations of the European Central Bank, which wants to impose a digital euro entirely in its own hands […] It’s time to bet on freedom.” She went on to advocate for a flourishing Bitcoin mining sector in the EU, suggesting that France’s nuclear energy infrastructure could supply a competitive edge. “We, the French, hold the cards with our nuclear trump card,” she said, framing domestic power generation as an untapped enabler of large-scale mining operations. Knafo also addressed the need to adjust current taxation policies, urging lawmakers to “stop taxing cryptocurrency holders” and stressing that crypto-asset holders took personal risks to generate their wealth. She characterized existing government deficits as directly fueling inflation and economic instability: “Government deficits that drive money creation […] create inflation, that lead to chaos […] Let them protect themselves from the insane spiral you’ve created.” At press time, Bitcoin traded at $106,947.",Bitcoin News|bitcoin|bitcoin news|bitcoin price|btc|BTC news|btc price|Sarah Knafo|Strategic Bitcoin Reserve|Strategic Bitcoin Reserve EU,EN,0,0,AAVE|ADA|ALTCOIN|ASIA|BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|BUSINESS|COMMODITY|DOGE|DOT|ETH|EXCHANGE|FIAT|LINK|LTC|LUNA|MARKET|MATIC|MINING|REGULATION|SHIB|SOL|SPONSORED|TECHNOLOGY|TRADING|TRX|UNI|USDT|WALLET|XMR|XRP|ZEC|ZRX|OTHER|RESEARCH|ARB|BITTENSOR|BNB|CRO|WIF|HBAR|ICP|IMX|INJ|NEAR|PEPE|SUI|TON|USDC|FLOKI|ONDO|BONK|SEI|JUP|BSV|WLD|APE|HNT|FTT|BTG|MOG|PYUSD|MEME|RAY|ARKM|MX|AIRDROP|TOKEN SALE|FORKS|TOKEN LISTING AND DELISTING,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2024-12-17 23:30:31

Can the Shiba Inu Price Recover? The Shiba Inu price is currently just over 20% down from its recent highs and these losses could extend in the short term. That said, risks remain tilted towards a renewed meme coin pump at any point before the end of the year, or in early 2025. Sentiment remains bullish ahead of the arrival of the Trump administration in the White House in January. A Bitcoin strategic reserve , which seems more and more likely every day right now, could send BTC to the moon. And that could mean rotation into altcoins , including major meme coins. All the while, the incoming Department of Government Efficiency (D.O.G.E.) will keep Dogecoin (DOGE) and the broader meme coin market in focus.

How High Will Shiba Inu Go? Assuming the Shiba Inu price hits new highs for the year soon, it could soon challenge its record highs in the $0.000090 area soon. Beyond that, a parabolic rally could be in store. A rally towards the 3.618 or 4.236 Fibonacci extension from the 2023 lows back to the 2021 highs suggests gains of as much as 10x from current levels are very possible. That would see Shiba Inu attain a market cap of over $150 billion. That may seem ridiculous, but if Bitcoin hits $200,000, that would see its market cap exceed $4 trillion. In this scenario, SHIB’s market cap would only amount to about 4% of Bitcoin’s, which is to unbelievable when considering its position as a leading meme coin in the market. The near-term future looks very bright for the meme coin space and Shiba Inu, though, as ever, these are incredibly volatile markets. In order to reap big gains, investors also need to be able to HODL through rapid and aggressive downturns.

Metaplanet Inc., often referred to as the “Japanese MicroStrategy,” has announced the issuance of ¥4.5 billion (approximately $30 million) in zero-interest bonds to fund its Bitcoin acquisition strategy. The firm is positioning itself as Asia’s largest corporate Bitcoin holder. The announcement marks Metaplanet’s fourth series of bonds, with a maturity date set for June 16, 2025. The zero-interest bonds will be released in tranches which will allow the company to raise funds for Bitcoin purchases. Metaplanet plans to redeem these bonds through the previously issued warrants, according to reports. Metaplanet’s strategic Bitcoin acquisition plan Since April 2024, Metaplanet has made Bitcoin its treasury reserve asset and has already acquired over 1,150 BTC, worth about $122.67 million. This approach is similar to MicroStrategy’s Bitcoin reserve. Metaplanet’s new bond issuance is to speed up its Bitcoin buying strategy specifically to purchase more Bitcoin. By issuing zero-interest bonds, Metaplanet avoids short-term financial stress while using the funds to grow its assets. Investors benefit because these bonds are sold at a discount but pay the full value at maturity. The bond issuance news resulted in a 51% surge in Metaplanet’s stock price over the past five trading sessions. Shares reached an all-time high of 4,270 JPY, increasing the company’s market capitalization beyond the $1 billion mark. Over 27.8 billion yen (~$180 million) worth of Metaplanet shares was traded, showing the company’s ability to capitalize on its Bitcoin-centric approach. Even Simon Gerovich, CEO of Metaplanet, acknowledged the market’s overwhelming response. Metaplanet plans to issue additional private placement bonds worth up to ¥5 billion to expand its Bitcoin reserves. These bonds are to be issued in partnership with EVO FUND. The proceeds from the bond issuances will also be allocated exclusively for Bitcoin purchases, reinforcing Metaplanet’s long-term vision. Shareholder rewards program in Bitcoin In addition to its bold investment moves, the company also announced a Bitcoin rewards program. The company announced a 30-million-yen ($199,500) prize pool, which will reward shareholders who own at least 100 shares as of December 31, 2024. Through a lottery system, 2,350 selected shareholders will receive varying amounts of Bitcoin. Metaplanet issued ¥4.5 billion in zero-interest bonds to increase its Bitcoin holdings, strengthening its position as Asia’s largest corporate Bitcoin holder.

Santa Rides Shiba (SANTSHIB), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 19,000% in price in the coming days. This is because SANTSHIB is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Santa Rides Shiba can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Santa Rides Shiba could become the next viral memecoin. Santa Rides Shiba launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Santa Rides Shiba on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Santa Rides Shiba by entering its contract address – CxpeR8vdgeVWZFwBytS7PRrXHBwVgPJWZBJUcpK3k7vT – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum.

Analysts speculate that this critical support level will be a bounce-off point for the Dogecoin price to reach $4 . However, in the shadow of the Dogecoin price’s hype, many top investors are putting their money into a new altcoin, WallitIQ (WLTQ) . Why? This AI altcoin, in the second presale stage, is priced at just $0.0243 and has the potential to outpace Dogecoin in reaching the $4 price milestone.

37776413,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=663540,1734480059,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/newsbtc.png,Analyst Who Correctly Predicted The Fantom Breakout Above $1 Reveals What’s Next In The Parabolic Trend,https://www.newsbtc.com/news/fantom/fantom-breakout-above-1-trend/,"A crypto analyst on TradingView, known as ‘Tradecitypro,’ has published a detailed Fantom (FTM) report, breaking down the cryptocurrency’s price action across the daily and 4-hour timeframe. After accurately predicting Fantom‘s surge above $1, the analyst highlights key price levels, market trends, potential price movements, and bullish technical indicators for FTM’s next parabolic trend. Fantom Daily Timeframe: Signs Of Trend Weakness After correctly forecasting FTM’s price breakout at $0.84, the TradingView analyst has revealed that the cryptocurrency is now following a parabolic uptrend, supported by a curved ascending trendline. According to the analyst, Fantom’s price has reacted multiple times to this distinctive trendline, ending price corrections and resuming its upward momentum. During the last bullish surge during Fantom’s uptrend, the cryptocurrency broke past the 0.7707 resistance and rose to the weekly resistance zone at 1.1116, where it stabilized above that level. Moreover, several indicators suggest that FTM may be slowing down and losing momentum. Its candle sizes have been gradually shrinking, indicating reduced bullish activity. Additionally, price corrections have intensified, signaling increased selling pressures and potential profit-taking. Fantom’s trading volume has also declined, suggesting that traders’ interests might shift. Another technical indicator that is currently bearish is the Relative Strength Index (RSI), which is showing signs of divergence, signaling a potential reversal of the price of FTM drops below 55.74 on the RSI. Looking ahead, the TradingView analyst has revealed that a notable sign of sharp bullish trends and pre-pump movements is when a cryptocurrency exhibits weakness and a potential for a price reversal. If the current bearish trend for Fantom continues, the analyst has set the first minor resistance level at 1.6218. Additionally, if FTM can maintain a stable price above this zone, its next and strongest resistance could be at 3.2506. This resistance zone is near FTM’s all-time high of $3.46, representing a significant supply region. On the other hand, if FTM experiences a price correction, it would likely drop to the first support at the curved trendline. If the trendline is broken, the next price levels to watch are 1.1116 and 0.7707. A sustained price decline below 0.7707 would invalidate the previous bullish scenario for Fantom, potentially pushing the price further down to between 0.5349 and 0.2928. 4-Hour Timeframe: Ascending Channel And Potential Breakouts In the 4-hour timeframe, the TradingView analyst revealed that Fantom is currently moving within an Ascending Channel. The cryptocurrency’s price is interacting with the midline of the channel, providing temporary support. The analyst has revealed that no significant moves will be expected if Fantom remains within this Ascending channel. However, if the cryptocurrency can break out, it could lead to two potential scenarios: the start of a new parabolic trend or a trend exhaustion due to a loss in bullish momentum. The TradingView analyst has identified the price level at 1.636 as Fantom’s next static resistance. However, if FTM’s price has not yet reached this zone, the analyst suggests a safer strategy of taking long positions based on Dow Theory and channel breakouts.

Feels good, right? Well, the market’s buzzing with three coins that might just get you there. BTFD Coin (BTFD) is shaking up the scene with its massive presale momentum, Play-to-Earn (P2E) game, and unbeatable community vibe. At the same time, Brett (BRETT) and COQ Inu (COQ) are making waves in the meme coin world with explosive gains and strong blockchain integration. If you’re scouting the best meme coins to buy for 2025, you’ve landed at the right spot. Let’s break down what makes these three coins worth watching, with a laser focus on BTFD Coin, the presale powerhouse currently turning heads across the crypto space. BTFD Coin (BTFD): A Presale Powerhouse You Don’t Want to Miss BTFD Coin is not just a meme; it’s a movement. Launched with the ethos of “Buy The F**ing Dip,”* BTFD has turned the legendary investment mantra into a full-blown ecosystem that rewards early movers. Since the presale kicked off at just $0.000004 per coin, it’s been nothing but up. Now in Stage 12, the price has hit $0.00013, with the coin set to list at $0.0006 at the end of the presale. Here’s the jaw-dropper: BTFD has raised over $4.1 million, with more than 56 billion coins sold and 5,700+ holders already on board. That’s what you call momentum. If you’re wondering, “How much could I earn?”, let’s do the maths. Say you invest $1,000 right now in Stage 12. At $0.00013 per coin, you’ll bag a staggering 7.69 million BTFD coins. When the presale ends and the price hits $0.0006, your $1,000 investment could balloon to $4,615. And that’s just the start. But BTFD isn’t just about hype. The project has actual substance with its Beta P2E game now live. You can join the Bulls Squad, tackle levels, and get a taste of what’s to come. Rewards aren’t live in the Beta yet, but this sneak peek is proof that BTFD is building something solid. Add to that staking rewards with an average 90% APY and it’s clear why investors are loading up their bags. Oh, and did I mention the BTFD Coin Referral Program? Share your referral code and earn 10% of the raise amount in BTFD tokens if you make the top 20 leaderboard. Your friends get an extra 10% BTFD when they spend $50 or more. Everybody wins. With Ethereum as its backbone and liquidity locked for three years, BTFD isn’t messing around. This isn’t just a meme coin; it’s a full-on ecosystem, primed for 2025’s bull run. If you’ve been hunting for the best meme coins to buy for 2025, don’t miss this dip. BTFD is your golden ticket. Brett (BRETT): The Rising Star on Base Chain Let’s talk about Brett (BRETT), a meme coin that’s captured hearts and wallets alike. Inspired by its Base Chain integration, Brett has proven that it’s more than just a flash in the pan. Trading at $0.1749 with a market cap of $1.8 billion, Brett’s price has doubled since November 2024, showing strong momentum in the competitive meme coin space. What’s driving this growth? A combination of strategic exchange listings and solid community support. Major exchanges have opened their doors to Brett, bringing more liquidity and visibility to the project. There’s also mounting speculation that Brett might score listings on Binance and Coinbase, which would catapult its popularity even further. Despite the high volatility (par for the course with meme coins), Brett’s trajectory is hard to ignore. Its recent performance and integration with Base Chain make it a strong contender among the best meme coins to buy for 2025. Whether it’s the next Pepe or something even bigger remains to be seen, but Brett has certainly earned its spot on this list. COQ Inu (COQ): Avalanche’s Meme Coin King Over on the Avalanche blockchain, COQ Inu (COQ) is quietly stealing the show. Priced at $0.000002373 with a market cap of $162 million, COQ Inu has firmly established itself as Avalanche’s top meme coin. Boasting a 24-hour trading volume of $20.44 million, it’s clear that COQ Inu isn’t just a niche project—it’s a growing phenomenon. COQ Inu’s secret sauce lies in its transparency and tokenomics. The team has burned liquidity and renounced contracts, ensuring the community’s trust in the project. Combine that with Avalanche’s low fees and lightning-fast transactions, and COQ Inu offers a compelling alternative to Ethereum-based meme coins. Market sentiment has been a major driver here. COQ Inu’s recent recognition among high-ROI meme coins has attracted investors seeking the next big win. With its unique position in the Avalanche ecosystem and its commitment to decentralisation, COQ Inu is certainly one of the best meme coins to buy for 2025 if you’re looking to diversify beyond Ethereum. Final Thoughts: Don’t Miss Out on BTFD Coin’s Presale With 2025 just around the corner, the race to snag the best meme coins to buy for 2025 is heating up. BTFD Coin (BTFD) stands out as the clear front-runner, with its explosive presale success, P2E game, and community-driven vision. Raising over $4.1 million and counting, BTFD is shaping up to be the ultimate early-mover opportunity for investors ready to ride the bull run. At the same time, Brett (BRETT) is surging ahead on Base Chain, and COQ Inu (COQ) continues to dominate Avalanche with its transparent, low-fee model. Each of these projects offers something unique, but if you’re after a game-changing investment, BTFD Coin deserves your attention. Don’t let this opportunity pass you by. Join the BTFD presale now, stack your bags, and prepare to ride the bull into 2025. Timing is everything—and this is your moment to buy the f***ing dip.

Tether has invested strategically in StablR, a European startup focused on euro-denominated stablecoins. This partnership is to increase the use of stablecoins across Europe, especially with the European Union’s new regulations on digital assets set to take effect in 2024. Why Is This Investment Important? Stablecoins are digital currencies pegged to real-world assets like the US dollar or euro. They offer stability and making them less volatile than other cryptocurrencies. Tether’s investment in StablR is the sign of company’s commitment to promoting stablecoins in Europe, particularly as the region prepares for the upcoming Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA) regulation, which will regulate cryptocurrencies and stablecoins in the EU. StablR, which has already received a license in Malta to issue MiCA-compliant stablecoins and will use Tether’s tokenization platform, Hadron , to facilitate the conversion of traditional assets into digital tokens. By converting it will allow businesses to create digital versions of stocks, bonds, commodities, and more while complying with legal regulations on the whole. StablR’s Role and the Future of Stablecoins StablR offers two types of stablecoins: EURR , which is pegged to the euro, and USDR , which is pegged to the US dollar. Both stablecoins are available on popular blockchain networks like ERC-20 and Solana , and transactions on different platforms. With the help of Tether’s platform, StablR plans to expand its offerings and make stablecoins available on more blockchain networks, allowing even more people and businesses to use them. The stablecoin market is growing especially in countries with unstable economies, Europe is also showing increased interest, with many looking for alternatives to traditional banking systems. Tether’s investment in StablR comes as crypto exchanges adapt to new regulations in Europe (MiCA) that require stablecoin issuers to meet strict compliance and transparency standards. Tether’s investment in StablR helps bring stablecoins like EURR and USDR into Europe’s financial system. With Tether’s support, this partnership makes stablecoins easier to use and ensures they follow the rules in digital currencies.

Related Reading: The $589 XRP Dream: Believers Aren’t ‘Delusional’ Enough, Expert Says The study indicates that in the third quarter of 2024 Solana’s ecosystem funding reached $173 million, the highest level since mid-2022. This money flow shows a strong conviction in Solana’s ability to be the top blockchain platform. Solana: Key Drivers Of Growth One of the key reasons for this positive prognosis is the upcoming introduction of a spot SOL Exchange-Traded Fund (ETF). As regulatory conditions improve, experts predict that institutional investors will flock to Solana, increasing its market position. We are so back!

Jump into the full report now ⬇️ pic.twitter.com/AzOZhiAib5 — Messari (@MessariCrypto) December 16, 2024 The introduction of a spot ETF might result in considerable financial inflows, placing Solana as a viable competitor to other cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin and Ethereum. Moreover, ongoing improvements to Solana’s infrastructure are anticipated to augment its performance. Jump Trading’s Firedancer client pledges to enhance transaction velocities and network scalability. The preliminary implementation has commenced, with complete deployment anticipated in 2025. This enhancement will broaden client alternatives while bolstering network security by reducing dependence on a singular codebase. Institutional Interest And Market Sentiment Reflecting the increasing institutional interest in Solana, companies like VanEck and Bitwise have lately registered for a spot SOL ETF. This action points to Solana’s unique value proposition as a high-performance blockchain starting to be acknowledged by conventional finance. If this tendency keeps up, many predict SOL’s price would soar to new heights; some even project it may hit $4,000. Solana’s market attitude remains positive, particularly after it just went past the $220 price level. If the movement continues, analysts anticipate SOL will reach its previous all-time high of $263. The combination of increased capital, technological breakthroughs and institutional support fosters Solana’s expansion.

In a new video update, Guy Turner, the host of CoinBureau, tells his 2.57 million YouTube subscribers that the market cap for Pyth Network ( PYTH ) may eventually soar due to its potential to generate massive fee revenue. “In my opinion, Pyth Network is one of the most underrated cryptos there is. That’s because it’s an oracle that provides high-frequency data feeds that blockchains like Solana depend on. In other words, Pyth Network is like Chainlink, and some would argue that it’s better than Chainlink. That’s because Pyth Network technically has its own blockchain called Pyth Net, which could theoretically leverage the PYTH token for fees someday. This could make PYTH bigger than LINK, which is already pretty darn big. For the time being, though, PYTH continues to fly under the radar, which is good news for those looking to get in early, but bad news for those who have already been accumulating for a while.” PYTH is trading for $0.49 at time of writing, up 7% in the last 24 hours. With a market cap of $1.79 billion, PYTH is the 83rd largest crypto project. Meanwhile, LINK is trading for $29.08 at time of writing, up slightly on the day. With a market cap of $18.21 billion, LINK is the 13th largest crypto project.

Table of Contents Bitcoin soars to new highs Institutional powerplay Macroeconomic crosswinds What do experts think? Bitcoin soars to new highs Bitcoin ( BTC ) has once again stolen the spotlight. On Dec. 17, BTC climbed to an all-time high of $108,260, pushing its post-U.S. election gains to over 50%. As of this writing. 17, it is trading around $106,663 levels. BTC 5-month price chart | Source: crypto.news BTC’s rally follows President-elect Donald Trump’s proposal to establish a U.S. Bitcoin strategic reserve, a concept that has sparked widespread excitement across markets. Trump’s announcement, made during his speech at the New York Stock Exchange on December 12, aims to position the U.S. ahead of global competitors in the digital asset space. He pointed to the need for America to “do something great with crypto” and to build reserves similar to its existing strategic oil stockpile. The idea of a Bitcoin reserve isn’t entirely new. It was first introduced through the BITCOIN Act, championed by Republican Senator Cynthia Lummis, which envisions the U.S. acquiring 1 million BTC over the next five years to help address the growing $35 trillion national debt. Another major factor driving this surge has been institutional activity, particularly from MicroStrategy, a firm synonymous with aggressive Bitcoin accumulation. In the past week alone, MicroStrategy announced it had purchased $1.5 billion worth of BTC at an average price of $100,386 per coin. This recent acquisition brings its total Bitcoin holdings to 439,000 BTC, valued at around $47 billion. The company’s Bitcoin strategy has paid off immensely, catapulting its market cap from $1.1 billion in 2020 to nearly $100 billion today. Moreover, MicroStrategy’s inclusion in the Nasdaq 100 index, effective next week, is also expected to boost further demand for its stock as funds and ETFs rebalance their portfolios. Meanwhile, Ethereum ( ETH ) hasn’t been left behind in this crypto frenzy. After a period of stagnation, ETH showed strong signs of life, climbing to a seven-day high of $4,106 on December 16—a 6% weekly gain. While Ethereum has faced some minor retracement due to profit booking, it remains steady around the $3,950 mark as of this writing. ETH 6-month price chart | Source: crypto.news Let’s dive deeper into the key developments driving Bitcoin and Ethereum, analyze the macroeconomic indicators shaping this bull run, and see what experts believe could happen in the days to come. Institutional powerplay Bitcoin and Ethereum are both showing strong momentum, but the underlying story becomes clearer when we look at ETF inflows, liquidations, and futures open interest. Spot Bitcoin ETFs have been on a tear this month. Since December began, they’ve seen consistent inflows every single day, adding over $5.16 billion as of Dec. 16. These inflows have pushed the total assets under management for Bitcoin ETFs to $123 billion — a strong signal of confidence, especially from institutional investors. Ethereum ETFs, however, tell a different story. Between their launch on Jul. 23 and Dec. 3, inflows were modest, reaching just $733.6 million. Compared to Bitcoin’s performance, this figure looks miniscule. But momentum has clearly shifted. Since Dec. 4, Ethereum ETFs have seen consistent inflows, adding $1.58 billion in a matter of days, suggesting that investors are warming up to Ethereum, likely encouraged by its price performance and Bitcoin’s strong market lead. Liquidation data adds more context to what’s happening in the market. Over the last 24 hours, as of Dec. 17, $339 million worth of positions were liquidated across the crypto market, with $205 million in longs and $134 million in shorts wiped out. 24-hour liquidation heatmap | Source: CoinGlass For Bitcoin, total liquidations have been around $60 million, with short positions making up the majority at $30 million, compared to $29 million from longs, suggesting that many traders betting against Bitcoin’s rally were forced out of their positions as BTC climbed past $108,000. Ethereum saw even heavier liquidations, totaling $78.5 million, with shorts again taking a larger hit at $52 million, again reflecting how ETH’s recent price push to $4,100 surprised many bearish traders. Meanwhile, Bitcoin’s futures open interest — the total value of outstanding futures contracts — has seen monumental growth . Back in early October, open interest sat at $32 billion. Following Trump’s election victory and the resulting bullish sentiment, that figure grew rapidly, reaching $55 billion by mid-November. Since then, open interest has continued to climb, hitting a massive $70 billion as of December 17. Rising open interest paired with increasing prices is a bullish signal, as it shows new money flowing into the market and traders placing bets on further upside. Put simply, Bitcoin’s rally isn’t running on fumes. ETF inflows are strong, futures activity is rising, and short sellers are being squeezed out of their positions. Ethereum, while slower to catch up, is now benefiting from the same momentum, with growing ETF inflows and shorts being liquidated. Both assets appear to have solid footing for their current uptrends, with institutional money and futures markets aligning to paint a bullish picture. Macroeconomic crosswinds The broader macroeconomic environment is currently a mixed bag, with a weakening U.S. Dollar, rate cut expectations, and political turbulence in Europe creating uncertainty across global markets. The USD, which had been gaining strength for a while, is now stalling. The November Retail Sales figure came in at 0.7%, beating expectations of 0.5%, but it wasn’t enough to inspire confidence . Excluding cars and transportation, growth was a weak 0.2%, below the forecasted 0.4%. Add to that the downward revisions for previous months, and it suggests consumer spending — the engine of the U.S. economy — is slowing. This ties directly to the Federal Reserve. The market expects a 25-basis-point rate cut on Dec. 18 with almost certainty. However, the Fed’s tone has been cautious about 2025. Expectations of aggressive rate cuts in the future are being dialed back, which has kept the Dollar from falling further. A stronger Dollar generally puts downward pressure on riskier assets, including Bitcoin, because investors often see USD as a safer bet. But now that the Dollar’s rally is pausing, it gives crypto some breathing room. At the same time, U.S. industrial production contracted by 0.1% in November when analysts expected growth of 0.3%, which signals that certain sectors of the economy are struggling. Combine that with sluggish equity markets — Asian and European stocks are down, and U.S. futures are sliding by around 1% — and we see a general lack of enthusiasm for traditional investments. Historically, when traditional assets underperform, and inflation remains under control, capital starts flowing into alternatives like Bitcoin. However, an overall bearish outlook can add choppiness and halt the bullish sentiments. Meanwhile, political instability in Germany — where Chancellor Olaf Scholz lost a confidence vote — and lingering economic troubles in France are weakening the Euro. Since the Euro makes up 58% of the U.S. Dollar Index, this directly supports the Dollar. However, global uncertainty often drives investors to look for assets that are independent of governments and central banks, like Bitcoin. Amid this, the U.S. 10-year Treasury yield has pulled back slightly to 4.38%, down from its recent high of 4.43%. If yields continue to fall and rate cuts accelerate, it becomes cheaper to borrow money, and investors will start looking for higher returns elsewhere. Bitcoin and Ethereum could likely benefit in these scenarios because they’re seen as high-return alternatives, especially when confidence in traditional markets is shaky. However, nothing is guaranteed. What do experts think? The ongoing Bitcoin and Ethereum rallies are creating the kind of setup that has historically led to explosive price movements. While the momentum is strong, there are signals investors should watch closely. One of the most key observations is Bitcoin’s tightening supply dynamics. As Quinten pointed out, “BlackRock eating up 9x daily mining supply,” — a clear indication that institutional investors are snapping up Bitcoin faster than it can be mined. BlackRock eating up 9x daily mining supply Supply shock incoming and normies still sleeping Institutional FOMO just starting — Quinten | 048.eth (@QuintenFrancois) December 17, 2024 With spot Bitcoin ETFs now giving institutions easy access to BTC, the supply shock narrative is gaining traction. If institutions continue to accumulate at this rate, a supply squeeze could amplify BTC’s next leg up. Meanwhile, Ethereum is showing its own signs of structural strength. According to Ali Martinez, in previous bull cycles, Ethereum’s parabolic runs occurred when long-term holders shifted from the belief phase into “greed mode.” In the past two bull cycles, #Ethereum $ETH went parabolic when long-term holders shifted into greed mode. Right now, they’re only in the early stages of the belief phase. The big move could still be ahead! pic.twitter.com/warxPOlSFj — Ali (@ali_charts) December 17, 2024 Right now, Ethereum is still in the early stages of belief, suggesting that the big move for ETH may still be ahead, aligning with Ethereum’s recent price performance, as it quietly climbed toward $4,000 after months of stagnation. Adding to this picture is Bitcoin’s MVRV ratio — a widely followed valuation tool. The MVRV ratio compares Bitcoin’s market value (its current market cap) to its realized value (average acquisition price based on on-chain data). Historical patterns show that BTC’s MVRV ratio peaked at 4.7x in 2017 and 4x in 2021. As Presto Research outlines , applying a conservative 3.5x multiple to Bitcoin’s projected realized value of $1.2 trillion by Q3 2025 could put BTC’s network value at $4.2 trillion — or about $210,000 per Bitcoin. However, the path to these price levels won’t be smooth. As Michaël van de Poppe noted, the Federal Reserve’s upcoming meeting introduces a key wildcard. New all-time high for #Bitcoin and a liquidity sweep for $ETH . FED Meeting around the corner, which is likely going to bring a ton of volatility into the markets. I won't be surprised we'll see $110K and $95K in the same week. — Michaël van de Poppe (@CryptoMichNL) December 16, 2024 While a rate cut is expected, the Fed’s commentary could trigger volatility. Bitcoin has often responded sharply to central bank decisions, as monetary policy directly impacts liquidity in financial markets. In Poppe’s words, “I won’t be surprised we’ll see $110K and $95K in the same week.” If Bitcoin’s rally extends further and investor confidence spreads, Ethereum’s historical tendency to lag behind and then catch up could play out again. To put it all together, the current rally has strong foundations: institutional demand, shrinking supply, and improving market sentiment. However, volatility remains a given, especially with the Fed’s decisions looming and macro uncertainties still in play. While the data points to a bullish path, managing risk is key as we move deeper into this cycle. Always remember the golden rule: never invest more than you can afford to lose.

Musk Loves Bitcoin (MUSKBTC), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 13,000% in price in the coming days. This is because MUSKBTC is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Musk Loves Bitcoin can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Musk Loves Bitcoin could become the next viral memecoin. Musk Loves Bitcoin launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Musk Loves Bitcoin on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Musk Loves Bitcoin by entering its contract address – 35GthqqwTd9HokNVfUzGpjsALCJbeUXXeKeJcrPCZsJB – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like MUSKBTC. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Press Releases,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|DOGE|SHIB|SOL,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2024-12-18 01:22:00

A new report from Nikkei details how BTC can sometimes be taxed at as much as 110%, as industry leaders and crypto advocates on the archipelago scramble desperately to get the government’s greasy fingers out of Satoshi’s wallet. According to Microstrategy’s Michael Saylor, it’s only “ paranoid crypto-anarchists ” who are worried about keeping bitcoin and government separate, or being able to use crypto non-custodially and permissionlessly. But for the Japanese, holding bitcoin and other crypto assets has now become a huge liability — thanks solely to the state. If we consult the creator of bitcoin themselves, Satoshi Nakamoto, we see that the whole project was always meant to be electronic cash that doesn’t require a financial institution or third party; this is something now coming to bitter remembrance for those Japanese who had wished for the state to get more involved. How Bitcoin can be taxed at over 100% in Japan Of course there is debate about taxation in pretty much every country. And when it comes down to brass tacks, there is no getting around that it is money taken (usually without one’s express consent) under threat of force, and then spent on whatever the strangers in political office far away want to spend it on. Like it or not, it’s theft. Still, to avoid being caged, most people understandably pay the extortion fees out of self-preservation. But in Japan, things are getting out of control for even the most happily obedient normie. While the leader of the Democratic Party for the People (DPP), Yuichiro Tamaki, has been fighting alongside industry groups to get a separate 20% tax for crypto in place, the country’s new prime minister seems uninterested. PM Shigeru Ishiba recently went so far as to publicly doubt the legitimacy of bitcoin as an asset and to imply that tax reform would be promoting a scam to the public. So the possibility of being taxed at up to 55% on gains in Japan remains in place. But the nightmare doesn’t end there. Enter: the inheritance tax. A new report from Japanese financial media outlet Nikkei details how in some cases, people might be taxed for even more bitcoin value than they got in the first place. The December 18 piece describes how the inheritance tax, combined with other taxes, could result in someone being taxed at 110%. Here’s the hypothetical breakdown: Someone buys 100 BTC in December 2014 (worth 4.6 million JPY). They die in December 2024, leaving the BTC (now valued at 1.437 billion JPY) to their child. The child must pay an inheritance tax maxed out at 55%. The heir then sells the BTC upon inheriting it, and must pay taxes on gains, with the acquisition price still being the original 4.6 million yen. Combine the two 55% taxes and others (inheritance tax, income tax, and local resident tax) and the child is now taxed at a rate higher than the value of the asset itself, or 110%. The article goes on to note that even in cases where less value is involved, rates can still reach 100%, and details that even small gains in crypto can end up being taxed at rates higher than those of stocks. “Even if the profit from selling virtual currency is small, there are many cases where the tax rate is higher than stocks,” the article by Tomoko Ōga states. “If the income amount subject to comprehensive taxation is 3.3 million yen or more but less than 6.95 million yen, the maximum income tax rate is 20% and the local resident tax is 10%, which is higher than the total of 20% for separate declaration taxation.” Perhaps there was something to that permissionless exchange thing after all, but each day the state gets more involved, the very real stakes and threats of punishment are jacked up higher and higher. Thankfully, this results in even more innovation and development of efficient P2P (peer-to-peer) protocols so peaceful people can use their money freely and efficiently, without having to be extorted of their inheritance or pay for war. But then again, maybe they are just being paranoid.

His insights come at a time when the crypto market has experienced significant growth, and after Bitwise released its annual top 10 crypto predictions for the next year. #1 Bitcoin Structured Products Surge Park predicts that by 2025, Bitcoin structured products will see an asset influx of at least $5 billion. He states, “The cold, hard truth is that most private wealth managers and institutions remain hesitant about taking on directional Bitcoin exposure.” Related Reading: Crypto Watchlist: Top 5 Coins To Watch This Week He elaborates that products like buffered notes and principal-protection ETFs will be pivotal in bridging this gap, offering tailored exposure to Bitcoin’s volatility to meet institutional preferences. “I predict that buffered notes, principal-protection ETFs, and similar instruments will unlock a floodgate of new demand, giving institutions access to Bitcoin’s volatility at the price they deserve, customized to their own preferences,” Park remarks. #2 Maple Finance Outpaces BlackRock’s BUIDL With a total value locked (TVL) of approximately $535 million as of his writing, Park believes Maple Finance will surpass BlackRock’s BUIDL project. He argues, “I hold an unapologetic view that decentralized markets, which enable novel financial primitives, will see adoption faster than ‘security tokenization’ projects retrofitting to legacy infrastructure.” Park sees decentralized lending platforms like Maple Finance, which provide institutional-grade services, as the category winners in the near future, potentially aided by favorable regulatory changes under the incoming Trump administration. “Institutional-grade, crypto-asset-backed decentralized lending like Maple Finance remains the most promising near-term category winner, bolstered by potential regulatory tailwinds,” Park forecasts. #3 Emergence Of A New Decentralized Crypto Stablecoin Despite past failures like LUNA, Park anticipates the rise of a new decentralized stablecoin backed by a decentralized strategic reserve. He asserts, “Bitcoin’s role as a reserve asset is now undeniable, spanning corporate balance sheets to nation-states,” but emphasizes the crypto community’s desire for a reserve that is “decentralized free from sovereign whims at all costs.” Related Reading: Crypto Market Hit Hard With $1.7 Billion Liquidated, Largest Event Since 2021 The new stablecoin, he predicts, will leverage heightened transparency and cryptographic proofs, aiming to restore trust and utility in decentralized finance. “Despite the scars left by LUNA, I predict a more robust effort will rise, built with heightened transparency and leveraging the long-awaited arrival of cryptographic proofs. I have some exemplary candidates in mind that can and will lead the way,” he states. These predictions by Park come after the predictions from Bitwise for 2025. The firm has projected Bitcoin to exceed $200,000, driven by institutional investment and ETF inflows. Ethereum and Solana are also expected to reach new all-time highs, further solidifying the growth narrative in the crypto space. Additionally, Bitwise sees 2025 as potentially becoming the “Year of the Crypto IPO,” with several crypto unicorns expected to go public in the US. At press time, Bitcoin traded at $106,794.

Dogecoin Price Could Replicate 2021 Bull Pattern In an X post , Trader Tardigrade raised the possibility of the Dogecoin price replicating a bullish pattern from the 2021 market cycle. This bullish pattern led to a 30,000% surge in the Dogecoin price back then, suggesting that DOGE could again enjoy such price gains in this market cycle. The analyst’s accompanying chart showed that the Dogecoin price could reach as high as $16 if it replicates the 2021 bull pattern. The chart also showed that the Dogecoin price surge to $16 could happen sometime next year. However, despite this bullish outlook for the Dogecoin price, it looks almost impossible for DOGE to reach this target based on its circulating supply. A Dogecoin price surge to $16 will give DOGE a market cap of $2.3 trillion, which is almost impossible at the moment, considering that the crypto market is just valued at over $2 trillion. Why Investors Should Buy ETFSwap (ETFS) Which Will Rally 70,000% Investors are better off buying the ETFSwap (ETFS) token, which will rally 70,000% in 18 days. This bullish outlook for the token stems from its incredible utility, which is already gaining much attention. ETFS is the native token of the ETFSwap platform, which tokenizes exchange-traded funds (ETFs) and enables them to be traded on-chain. The ETFSwap (ETFS) token provides an easier and more convenient way to trade these traditional assets since investors simply need to convert the token for their desired ETF. This explains why traditional finance (TradFi) investors have been looking to purchase as many coins as possible since ETFS got listed on the Uniswap decentralized exchange (DEX). The massive demand for the token so far will contribute to the projected 70,000% rally in 18 days. This is why investors who have yet to invest need to hurry and buy as many coins as possible to position for this price surge. ETFSwap’s (ETFS) other use cases prove that the token can indeed witness this parabolic rally. The ETFSwap (ETFS) token provides access to crypto assets and other commodities on the ETFSwap platform including gold, silver, rubber, cotton, and crude oil, among others. Users will simply swap the token for their desired asset. This makes portfolio diversification much easier as investors will now be able to gain access to several asset classes in one place. As such, it is best to get ahead of these investors and accumulate as many coins as possible. The ETFS token is deflationary , which is another reason it could easily rally by 70,000% and outperform the Dogecoin price. The ETFSwap (ETFS) team has committed to burning some of the fees earned on the DeFi platform to buy back and burn as many ETFS tokens as possible. This deflationary mechanism makes it easier for the ETFSwap (ETFS) price to surge, especially considering the massive demand that the token is already witnessing. Conclusion The ETFSwap (ETFS) token is set to be listed on major exchanges in the coming weeks. It is best to front-run these listings as the 70,000% rally could begin as soon as these exchanges ETFS. Moreover, these exchanges will begin to accumulate ETFS ahead of the listing, so it is best to hurry and accumulate the coin. Buying the ETFSwap (ETFS) token means that you get to enjoy as much as a 700x return on investment (ROI). This is definitely an opportunity to make life-changing gains and one you shouldn’t pass on in this bull run.

One minute, they’re trending, and the next, they’re surging in price. The meme coin space is as fast-moving as a TikTok trend, and if you’re not careful, you could miss out on the next big thing. Lucky for you, we’re here to make sure that doesn’t happen. Whether you’re looking for the best meme coins to buy now or just trying to keep up with the latest movements in the meme coin world, we’ve got the lowdown on three big players: BTFD Coin, Notcoin, and Book of Meme. Just this week, BTFD Coin hit a major PR milestone, racking up over $4.1 million in presale funds. At a presale price of $0.00013, it’s safe to say that investors are paying attention. And who can blame them? This meme coin isn’t just meme-driven; it has real utility with its upcoming Play-to-Earn (P2E) game, staking rewards, and a community-first mentality. Let’s take a deeper dive into these three coins and find out which one’s the best fit for your portfolio. BTFD Coin: The Meme Coin With Serious Potential If you’re even remotely plugged into the meme coin scene, you’ve probably seen this one popping up everywhere. It’s got the hype, the community, and the momentum to make a serious play in 2025. The BTFD Coin presale is absolutely crushing it, and with over $4.1 million raised, it’s clear that investors are getting in on the ground floor. Now, let’s look at what $8,000 could do for you. At today’s presale price of $0.00013, $8,000 would buy you a whopping 61,538,462 coins. That’s a lot of tokens for a relatively low price. And if the coin even hits a modest target of $0.0006 (still super conservative), your $8,000 investment could shoot up to $36,923. That’s a return of over 460%, just from holding for a few months. Of course, with the P2E game and staking rewards , the upside is even greater. So yeah, if you’re wondering which of the best meme coins to buy now, BTFD Coin is certainly one to watch. Notcoin: Earn Rewards, No Staking Required Next up, we’ve got Notcoin, the meme coin that’s shaking things up in the TON ecosystem. If you’re into Telegram and its growing influence on Web3, then Notcoin might be your next big move. They’ve recently launched their Earn programme, a game-changing initiative that lets users earn rewards just by holding TON-based tokens in their Telegram wallet—no complex staking required. This new twist makes it super easy to earn passive rewards without all the hoops and hurdles usually associated with staking. The Earn program essentially works like a launchpool, rewarding holders of Notcoin and other TON-based tokens by giving them access to airdrops. Think of it like a rewards buffet, where all you have to do is be active and hold the right tokens. Users can earn rewards hourly and even participate in exclusive pools like the Gold, Platinum, and Early Notcoin Staker groups for extra bonuses. For meme coin enthusiasts looking for a way to earn while they sleep, Notcoin’s Earn programme is a no-brainer. Book of Meme: A Surge of Hope for 2025 Now let’s talk about Book of Meme, which has been turning heads lately. This coin has all the potential to skyrocket, with predictions pointing to a $0.04 surge in 2025. Yep, you read that right. If Book of Meme can hit that target, early investors are looking at some serious returns. For reference, it’s trading at $0.008 now, so, yes, that’s a major upside we’re talking about! But what makes Book of Meme stand out? It’s not just about the meme—it’s about the community and the culture behind it. With its solid growth and the influence of meme culture, Book of Meme is one of those coins that could go from zero to hero in a matter of months. Wrap It Up: Which Meme Coin Is Right for You? So, what’s the verdict? When it comes to the best meme coins to buy now, there’s a lot to consider, but the combination of community, utility, and growth potential is key. If you’re after serious growth, BTFD Coin is the frontrunner right now. With its P2E game, staking rewards, and bullish momentum, it’s an entire ecosystem in the making. But hey, if you’re looking for something a bit more passive with rewards, Notcoin’s Earn programme could be just the ticket. And let’s not forget Book of Meme, which might just have the surprise factor for 2025. Whatever you choose, make sure to do your research, and don’t miss out on the chance to get in early on these best meme coins to buy now. Who knows? In a few months, you might just be laughing all the way to the bank. So, what are you waiting for? Sign up for BTFD Coin’s presale today.

With over 10,300 token holders and 350 million $TICS tokens sold, Qubetics is quickly proving itself as one of the best coins to invest in today. At the same time, Litecoin’s growing network strength and Fantom’s upcoming major upgrade are catching the attention of savvy investors. Qubetics is not just about hype; it brings real-world solutions where older platforms fell short. Its 13th presale stage is making waves with solid numbers, a 10% price increase every week, and the potential for massive gains. Meanwhile, Litecoin and Fantom are pushing forward with key updates that strengthen their use cases and future outlook. Qubetics Presale Draws Over 10,300 Holders with Real-Life Applications Qubetics is transforming how people and businesses interact with cryptocurrencies. Its multi-chain Qubetics Wallet combines convenience and innovation, making it easier than ever to manage digital assets across devices like iOS, Android, and desktops. Qubetics isn’t just for crypto enthusiasts—it’s built for everyday use in real-world scenarios. For example, a freelancer working with international clients can receive payments in $TICS tokens, which are automatically converted to stablecoins like USDT or USDC during transactions. This ensures stability for both parties, even as markets shift. Small businesses can also streamline cross-border payments without relying on outdated banking systems. Another standout feature is Qubetics’ virtual and physical debit card integration with Visa and Mastercard. Whether it’s paying for groceries, buying digital subscriptions, or making big-ticket purchases, users can connect Qubetics Wallet to Apple Pay or Google Pay, bridging the gap between traditional payments and crypto. For investors looking for diversification, the Qubetics Marketplace offers access to tokenized assets. Imagine owning a share of a luxury apartment in London or a piece of fine art, all made possible through $TICS tokens. This simplified process opens doors for average investors to tap into high-value markets. The 13th presale stage highlights Qubetics’ rising appeal. With over 10,300 holders and 350 million $TICS tokens sold, the project has already raised $6.9 million. At the current price of $0.0342, analysts predict that $TICS could reach $0.25 by the top crypto presale’s end , delivering a 630.19% ROI. If prices hit $1 post-presale, an investment of $140,000 today could turn into $3,949,092, showcasing immense growth potential. If you want to know more about this project, take a look at this video here . Litecoin Strengthens Its Network and Hash Rate Litecoin (LTC) has been making strong moves lately. In the past month, its price surged by over 50%, bringing renewed investor confidence and pushing the number of wallets in profit to a two-year high. This upward momentum reflects growing trust in Litecoin as a reliable alternative to Bitcoin. Litecoin’s network security is also at its strongest point ever. The hash rate—a key measure of computational power protecting the network—recently hit an all-time high of 1.74 PH/s. This 50% increase shows rising participation from miners, solidifying Litecoin’s resilience and long-term sustainability. However, analysts caution traders to watch for technical patterns, like the “inverse cup and handle,” which could signal short-term pullbacks. Despite this, Litecoin’s fundamentals remain strong, with its growing adoption and robust network positioning it as a staple in the crypto market. Fantom Set to Rebrand with Sonic Upgrade and Faster Speeds Fantom (FTM) is gearing up for a game-changing upgrade with its transition to the Sonic mainnet. This upgrade aims to boost transaction speeds, reduce fees, and improve overall scalability, making Fantom a go-to platform for decentralised applications (dApps) and DeFi projects. Ahead of this upgrade, Fantom saw a 16% price surge, indicating strong market excitement. Analysts note that technical indicators, like the MACD bullish crossover, suggest further gains may be on the horizon. The Sonic upgrade is particularly significant because it enhances Fantom’s ability to handle more transactions at lower costs—key factors for attracting developers and new projects. For users, this upgrade means faster, cheaper transactions, positioning Fantom as one of the most efficient platforms in the DeFi space. By addressing previous scalability concerns, Fantom is set to compete with leading Layer-1 solutions. Conclusion Qubetics, Litecoin, and Fantom are showing impressive developments that make them stand out as some of the best coins to invest in today. Qubetics’ presale success, with over 10,300 holders and 350 million $TICS tokens sold , offers investors a unique opportunity with real-world solutions and massive growth potential. Litecoin’s strengthened network security and rising hash rate highlight its reliability, while Fantom’s Sonic upgrade promises faster transactions and lower fees. Each of these projects is building momentum for the future, making them strong contenders for anyone seeking long-term gains.

Hedera’s Integration with Chainlink Enhances DeFi Capabilities Hedera is enhancing its decentralized finance (DeFi) ecosystem by integrating Chainlink’s Data Feeds and Proof of Reserve on its mainnet.

This upgrade introduces features that increase transaction execution speed by up to 600 times, positioning Cronos to support emerging AI agents and complex decentralized applications more efficiently.

Trump Patriot (TRUMPPAT), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 19,000% in price in the coming days. This is because TRUMPPAT is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Trump Patriot can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Trump Patriot could become the next viral memecoin. Trump Patriot launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Trump Patriot on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Trump Patriot by entering its contract address – 9hmvtogFEjzZQMFfJ5Hiq7fQSq7E38mG3Qjb7X42qM6P – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like TRUMPPAT. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Press Releases,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|DOGE|EXCHANGE|SHIB|SOL,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2024-12-18 02:43:00

Developed in partnership with Securitize, USDtb is designed to operate like existing fiat-backed stablecoins such as USDC and USDT, with reserves invested in cash or cash-equivalent assets to maintain a 1:1 value ratio. USDtb Debuts According to the official blog post , the stablecoin’s primary reserve asset, BUIDL, makes up 90% of USDtb’s overall backing, positioning it as the highest BUIDL-backed stablecoin to date. USDtb is independent of Ethena’s USDe, thereby providing users with an alternative stablecoin offering a distinct risk profile. Additionally, USDtb is expected to improve USDe’s resilience in volatile market conditions by potentially serving as a backup asset during periods of negative funding rates. The product has passed extensive audits from leading security firms such as Code4rena, Quantstamp, Cyfrin, and Pashov. It is being considered for inclusion in Spark’s $1 billion Tokenization Grand Prix. Ethena has tapped Copper, Zodia Custody, Komainu, and Coinbase Institutional to serve as custodians for its newly launched USDtb stablecoin. The token’s liquidity will be supported by major providers, including Jump, Cumberland, Amber Group, GSR Markets, and SCB Limited. USDtb’s Impact on Ethena’s Stablecoin Ecosystem José Maria Macedo, co-founder of blockchain research and development firm Delphi Labs, predicts that USDtb will become the largest on-chain tokenized treasury product within a month of its launch. Highlighting the significance for Ethena, Macedo noted that USDtb not only provides a “lower-risk” yield-bearing stablecoin option but also strengthens Ethena’s existing USDe stablecoin. The exec even went on to say that during periods when funding rates fall below treasury rates, Ethena can close out hedging positions and reallocate assets to USDtb. This approach reduces USDe’s exposure to negative funding rate concerns while ensuring that its floor yield matches the treasury rate. Meanwhile, Seraphim Czecker, Ethena’s head of growth, spoke about the impact of USDtb on Ethena’s operations, particularly in bearish market conditions. He explained that prolonged periods of negative funding rates no longer pose a threat to Ethena, as the platform can now allocate capital to its own real-world asset-backed stablecoin, USDtb. This effectively establishes a yield “floor” tied to the T-Bill rate, ensuring a stable APY even in unfavorable market environments. Czecker further highlighted USDtb’s scalability, noting its potential to exceed $100 billion in total value locked (TVL).
