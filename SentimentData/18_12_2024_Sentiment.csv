After reaching an all-time high (ATH) on November 22, Solana has experienced a 23% retracement, testing investor confidence. However, analysts remain optimistic, with many expecting a significant upward move in the coming weeks. Related Reading: Ethereum Forming A Symmetrical Pattern – Key Resistance At $4,100 Renowned analyst Jelle recently shared a technical analysis highlighting Solana’s strong potential. According to Jelle, the monthly chart for SOL is primed for an “absolute monster run,” indicating that the current consolidation phase may be laying the groundwork for a powerful breakout. This view aligns with the broader sentiment that Solana’s resilience above $210 could act as a springboard for the next phase of its rally. As one of the leading altcoins in the crypto market, Solana has attracted attention for its robust performance and potential to lead the next leg of the bull market. With the price now consolidating after a sharp pullback, all eyes are on SOL’s ability to maintain its critical support and reclaim momentum. Whether Solana can deliver on its bullish promise will be a key focus for traders and investors alike in the coming weeks. Solana Holds Key Demand Solana is currently trading above a critical level for this cycle—the $210 mark. This price point, which previously acted as a significant resistance, has now flipped into a vital support level, setting the stage for Solana’s next potential rally. The importance of this level cannot be overstated, as it represents a key area where buyers are stepping in to defend SOL’s bullish momentum. Renowned analyst Jelle recently shared a compelling technical analysis on X, emphasizing Solana’s strong outlook. According to Jelle, Solana’s monthly chart is primed for what he described as an “absolute monster run.” His analysis highlights how SOL’s price is now testing its 2021 all-time high (ATH) as support, a critical juncture that could determine its trajectory in the weeks to come. Jelle’s simple yet powerful chart indicates that if Solana manages to push decisively above the $210 level, it will confirm the strength of this support and potentially trigger a massive bull run. This rally could result in impressive gains for SOL, positioning it as a standout performer in the crypto market. Related Reading: Bitcoin Breaks ATH Pushing Back Into Price Discovery – BTC To $130K? For now, all eyes are on Solana’s ability to sustain its momentum and break higher. As it consolidates above this essential level, traders and investors are closely monitoring its next moves, anticipating the possibility of a historic price surge. Price Action Suggests A Big Move Soon Solana is trading at $221, maintaining its strength above the critical $210 support level. This resilience has bolstered confidence among investors, as SOL’s price action aligns bullishly across all time frames. Solana is gearing up for a major rally, but it must first overcome the $245 resistance level to confirm the uptrend. Market dynamics indicate that SOL is in a prime position for upward momentum. Unlike other assets that may show signs of hesitation or potential consolidation, Solana exhibits a well-defined price structure that strongly favors a breakout. The lack of bearish signals further solidifies this outlook, as there is little indication of an imminent correction or prolonged sideways trading.

If SOL successfully breaches the $245 resistance with strength, it could trigger a wave of buying pressure, propelling the price to new heights.

The stock’s been on a tear, climbing 40% since the U.S. presidential election. At $476.73, Tesla’s market cap now sits at a jaw-dropping $1.53 trillion. Compare that to Nvidia—last year’s golden child of growth stocks—sitting at $129.92 with a market cap of $318 billion. Analysts aren’t missing a beat. Tesla and Nvidia are two sides of the same coin: both are fueled by a tech future that seems unstoppable. Tesla has cars and autonomous tech; Nvidia has chips and AI infrastructure. One builds the machine, the other runs the software. Yet while Nvidia’s growth is starting to cool, Tesla’s numbers keep pulling investors in. Tesla’s 52-week range speaks volumes: it’s climbed from $138.80 all the way to $483.99 this year. Nvidia has moved between $47.32 and $152.89, a solid performance but far from Tesla’s high-octane climb. Why Wall Street’s watching Tesla like it watched Nvidia Cathie Wood, CEO of Ark Invest, says she sees Tesla hitting $2,600 by 2029, driven by what she calls “unmatched growth” in profits and revenues. If Wood’s predictions play out, Tesla could hit an enterprise value of $8.2 trillion in just five years. That makes Nvidia’s peak look tame by comparison. Investors are biting. The excitement is Tesla’s move toward AI-powered autonomous driving. It’s no secret Tesla isn’t just an electric car company anymore. Self-driving software and its robotaxi ambitions have Wall Street betting on a future Tesla that doesn’t just sell cars—it sells rides, powered by AI. Tesla’s strategy echoes Nvidia’s dominance during the AI boom. Nvidia’s chips became essential to generative AI development, fueling companies like OpenAI and driving profits to record highs. Tesla’s AI, on the other hand, lives on the roads. If it perfects autonomous driving, its software will become as essential as Nvidia’s chips. But there’s a catch. Tesla trades at a staggering price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 162. Nvidia’s ratio? A much more palatable 51.14. That makes Tesla a high-risk, high-reward bet. Goldman Sachs recently pointed this out, cautioning that Tesla’s valuation may be running ahead of its earnings. Nvidia’s growth is slowing, Tesla’s just getting started Nvidia is still the face of AI infrastructure, but the cracks are showing. After growing revenue by over 200% in recent quarters, analysts now expect Nvidia’s growth to slow to around 70%. Still impressive, but a clear sign that the AI boom is leveling out. Nvidia’s reliance on a handful of mega clients—like cloud giants and AI startups—has some investors worried. Tesla, meanwhile, is all momentum. The market sees a company that’s just scratching the surface of its AI potential. Self-driving cars are Tesla’s big bet. The trading data backs this up. Tesla has been gaining traction as one of Wall Street’s most traded stocks. Nvidia still holds the crown, with 197 million shares traded on December 17 compared to Tesla’s 108 million. Investors go all in on US stocks The bullish sentiment on Tesla is part of a broader trend. Bank of America’s Global Fund Manager Survey shows investors are dumping cash and going all in on equities. Cash allocations hit their lowest point since 2001, falling from 4.3% to 3.9%. That’s a sign investors are chasing gains and aren’t interested in sitting on the sidelines. Michael Hartnett, a strategist at Bank of America, called the mood “super-bullish.” Tesla’s surge, fueled by its AI story, is a perfect fit for this environment. Wall Street sees a growth machine, and it’s hungry for more. Interest rate cuts are adding fuel to the fire. Traders expect the Federal Reserve to start cutting rates, making stocks even more attractive. The S&P 500 is on track to close 2024 up more than 26%, far beyond anyone’s expectations. Analysts now predict another 10% climb next year, with growth stocks like Tesla leading the way. Nvidia played that role in 2023. Now Tesla’s taking the baton.

Her push for a national Bitcoin reserve comes amid a historic market upsurge that has propelled the world’s largest crypto by market capitalization to new heights in recent weeks, with BTC today marking a new record high above $108,000. No To Digital Euro, Yes To Strategic BTC Reserve In a speech before the European parliament, Sarah Knafo urged European lawmakers to establish a strategic BTC reserve. Knafo declared, “It is time to protect our people from inflation and the poor economic choices of our states.” She then reiterated her statements in a post on X (aka Twitter). She also cautioned that the European Central Bank’s plans of launching a central bank digital currency could result in a “dystopian world” where transactions are monitored, and citizens are debunked for simple remarks on social media platforms. The lawmaker stated, “it is time to bet on freedom,” adding: “No to the digital euro, yes to a strategic Bitcoin reserve.” Knafo further indicated that it’s time for the ECB to stop “totalitarian temptations” by urging a shift from regulatory overreach in crypto to adopting the decentralized nature of Bitcoin. She pointed out that Europe has adopted a different approach to crypto. While the U.S. mulls a strategic, national stockpile of the top cryptocurrency, local regulators in Europe have been mostly focused on regulation, taxation, and suppressing innovation. Knafo highlighted the outstanding success of El Salvador, where President Nayib Bukele made the unpopular decision to make Bitcoin legal tender in late 2021. Bukele was harshly criticized by U.S. politicians, the World Bank, and the IMF for the move. Nonetheless, the Latin American nation’s Bitcoin experiment has paid off handsomely , garnering over $300 million in unrealized profits so far. Calls To Stockpile Bitcoin Gain Traction Around The World Knafo’s speech comes as the U.S. stance toward Bitcoin undergoes massive changes following Donald Trump’s win against Kamala Harris last month. Trump and his allies have frequently voiced their support behind legislation to create a Bitcoin strategic reserve and will soon be well-positioned to make that a reality. Several U.S. lawmakers have made pushes to establish a strategic Bitcoin reserve. Binance ex-CEO Changpeng “CZ” Zhao recently forecasted the BTC reserve policy would be imitated globally. “This also has a knock-on effect on other countries in the world. If the U.S. is doing this, then every other country will have to do this,” he posited at the Bitcoin MENA conference last week. Notably, government officials in Brazil have already submitted legislation to realize that possibility, while a Japanese lawmaker named Satoshi put forth a formal request to his nation’s legislature last week to start a discussion about developing a national Bitcoin reserve for Japan.",Bitcoin|News|Bitcoin News|El Salvador,EN,0,0,ASIA|BTC|FIAT|MARKET|REGULATION,"{'name': 'ZyCrypto', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/zycrypto.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",zycrypto,2024-12-17 22:43:57

Cynthia Lummis",https://www.cryptopolitan.com/pro-digital-asset/,"Senator Cynthia Lummis believes 2025 will be a key year for Bitcoin, with the U.S. leading in digital assets under David Sacks. She proposes a Bitcoin reserve to protect against inflation and increase the dollar value. And believes the most pro digital asset administration ever. The year 2025 is looking like a big moment for Bitcoin and digital assets, with strong administration supporting their future. Senator Cynthia Lummis from Wyoming said that 2025 will be the year Bitcoin takes off. She believes the U.S. will become the world leader in digital assets and financial innovation. The Appointment of David Sacks as “Crypto Czar” Announcements comes with the appointment of David Sacks as the “Crypto Czar. ” David Sacks is a prominent venture capitalist and one of the early PayPal executives with deep knowledge and understanding of the tech world. Sacks has advocated for Bitcoin and other digital currencies, and many in the crypto community see him as a strong figure who can help shape policies that the growth of digital assets. Senator Lummis strongly supports Sacks’ leadership and believes that the U.S. will take a leading role in digital assets under his guidance. “ Under David Sacks’ leadership, the U.S. is primed to lead the world in digital assets and financial innovation,” said Lummis. Michael Saylor also supports this vision. He shares Lummis’ excitement, saying, “Under David Sacks’ leadership, the U.S. will not only lead the world in digital assets but also set the stage for financial innovation like we’ve never seen before.” Saylor’s endorsement of Sacks shows that many influential figures in the crypto community believe that this leadership is the key to true potential of digital assets in the U.S. Lummis’ Vision on Strategic Bitcoin Reserve One of Lummis’ bold proposals is the idea of a “strategic Bitcoin reserve” and mentions ” My Strategic Reserve.” This would involve the U.S. government acquiring and holding Bitcoin as part of its financial reserves, similar to how the country holds gold today. Lummis believes that Bitcoin can serve as a store of value that will protect the U.S. from inflation, strengthen the U.S. dollar, and improve the country’s financial health. She said, “I look forward to working closely with David Sacks to pass comprehensive digital asset legislation and my strategic Bitcoin reserve.” If adopted, this idea could change how the U.S. approaches its financial reserves and set an example for other countries to follow. The strategic Bitcoin reserve is not just a theoretical idea Lummis has suggested that the U.S. could use existing gold certificates to purchase Bitcoin without affecting the balance sheet. This could save billions of dollars and make the country’s financial system more resilient. With the right leadership and support, such a proposal could be a game changer for the global economy. The idea of the U.S. government formally adopting Bitcoin into its financial strategy would greatly increase the cryptocurrency market. Some states in the U.S., like Wisconsin and Michigan, have already begun experimenting with crypto in their investment portfolios. However, if the federal government takes action and incorporates Bitcoin into its reserves, it could open the doors for even more institutional investors and major players in the global financial markets. 2025 holds much promise for Bitcoin and digital assets. With leaders like Senator Cynthia Lummis, David Sacks, and Michael Saylor working together, the U.S. is on track to become the global leader in digital assets and financial innovation.

Trump Patriot (TRUMPPAT), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 19,000% in price in the coming days. This is because TRUMPPAT is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Trump Patriot can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Trump Patriot could become the next viral memecoin. Trump Patriot launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Trump Patriot on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Trump Patriot by entering its contract address – 9hmvtogFEjzZQMFfJ5Hiq7fQSq7E38mG3Qjb7X42qM6P – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like TRUMPPAT.

Sim, previously sanctioned by OFAC, oversaw the schemes, leveraging a complex web of crypto exchanges, money mules, and shell companies. Crypto cash-outs and the UAE connection The network’s key players operated primarily out of the United Arab Emirates. Lu Huaying, a Chinese national, allegedly began converting North Korean-obscured cryptocurrency into cash in early 2022. Between then and September 2023, Lu successfully laundered millions of dollars on behalf of Sim Hyon Sop. The scheme used money mules and crypto-to-fiat conversions to disguise the funds’ origins, allowing the DPRK to purchase goods and services essential for its missile development. Zhang Jian, another Chinese national based in the UAE, stepped in later. Between late 2022 and early 2023, Zhang facilitated fiat currency exchanges for Sim and allegedly acted as a cash courier. The funds, moved through layers of intermediaries, ultimately financed North Korea’s weapons programs. Green Alpine Trading, LLC, served as the core of the operation. Registered in the UAE, the front company was integral to the laundering process, providing Sim’s network with the infrastructure to move money seamlessly across borders. OFAC said Green Alpine attempted to provide “financial, material, and technological support” for North Korea’s illicit operations. The sanctions now freeze all U.S.-linked property and financial assets tied to Lu, Zhang, and Green Alpine Trading. Any entity controlled 50% or more by the sanctioned individuals or company is also blocked. U.S. citizens and institutions are barred from engaging with the network. North Korea’s crypto laundering tactics revealed North Korea’s strategy is simple but effective: steal crypto, launder it, and cash it out through proxies . Digital assets, with their anonymity and decentralized nature, have become critical to the DPRK’s revenue generation. The regime exploits cybercrime, fraudulent IT work, and stolen funds to bypass international sanctions. Sim Hyon Sop, the architect of the UAE-based operation, represents North Korea’s Korea Kwangson Banking Corp (KKBC). KKBC is a state-run entity already blacklisted under U.S. and United Nations sanctions for its role in funding the DPRK’s WMD programs. From China, Sim directs these schemes, setting up shell companies and managing bank accounts to obscure the origin of the funds. The Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) has long pointed to individuals like Sim as key players. They work as agents for state-backed institutions, pulling strings behind the scenes while using intermediaries like Lu and Zhang to handle the dirty work. By relying on trusted proxies, Sim’s network operates across multiple jurisdictions with minimal direct involvement from Pyongyang. The scale of North Korea’s crypto operations is staggering. Since 2017, estimates show that Pyongyang has stolen over $3 billion in cryptocurrency. These funds directly finance its ballistic missile and nuclear weapons programs, fueling the regime’s military ambitions while evading traditional banking systems.

The draft was reportedly presented by @btcpolicyorg as an executive order focusing on making Bitcoin a strategic reserve asset within the Exchange Stabilization Fund (ESF). The two-page document addressed certain key points the institute recognized as important to cover in what many consider a preliminary draft. Recommendations to gain a competitive advantage with Bitcoin The executive order describes Bitcoin as a strategic reserve asset that can bolster the US dollar’s resilience. It also demands the establishment of a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve (SBR) to serve as a permanent national asset for economic security. According to the draft, the US policy should include: Creating the Bitcoin reserve to grow the economy and maintain the US’s financial dominance in world markets. Making Bitcoin a strategic asset stored by the government to diversify national reserves and boost economic security. Striving to make the US the number one country for digital assets in terms of attracting investment, talent, and innovation. The draft highlights the need for the United States to adapt to global trends in digital finance as this is the only way to maintain economic stability and leadership. It also tags Bitcoin as a decentralized and finite store-of-value asset, with comparisons to digital gold — a sentiment many crypto stakeholders seem to agree with. MicroStrategy ’s Michael Saylor has even gone as far as suggesting the US sell all its gold to buy BTC. It may sound over the top, but Micahel Saylor has overtly supported Bitcoin, and his BTC gamble has paid off exponentially. Establishment of the SBR and Bitcoin designation According to the draft, the SBR will be handled by the Treasury Department, which will have strict oversight, including audits and security measures. The draft also recommended that any Bitcoins held by federal agencies should be transferred to the SBR within 7 days of the order’s issuance. It also declared Bitcoin as a reserve asset suitable for holding within the ESF, with acquisition programs to begin within two months. According to the acquisition program, about $21 billion in Bitcoin will be bought within a year using funds from the ESF. The purchases will happen under the watchful eyes of protocols to reduce mismanagement risks. Within a month, secure custody frameworks are expected to be implemented and this could include partnerships with secure service providers. Meanwhile, it will be up to the Treasury to create stringent standards to promote long-term security, including cryptographic verifications and less reliance on third parties. On sales from the SBR and transparency According to the draft, long-term preservation will be a priority, which means that any BTC the SBR buys will be locked down for at least two decades to protect the country’s financial strength. The documents say that Bitcoin sales can only happen under exceptional circumstances (e.g., economic or security crises). Asset liquidation will also require detailed justification and presidential approval. The draft also proposed that when the sales happen, they will be done with transparency and minimal disruption. There will be a public proof of reserve and cryptographic receipt of Bitcoin holdings will be published quarterly to promote transparency. The Treasury will be expected to provide reports on performance, security, and strategic benefits of Bitcoin within the ESF. Coordination between the various government agencies, including the Treasury, Federal Reserve and Department of Defense, among others will be encouraged in alignment with national security and economic policies. This draft has not been approved or signed, but many who have seen it seem to believe it is good enough. David Bailey, the CEO of Bitcoin Magazine, shared screenshots of the draft. He also endorsed the document and mentioned that the president’s signature is the only step needed to fully implement the Bitcoin reserve. The general sentiment among crypto stakeholders is that the draft is sufficient as a framework to integrate Bitcoin into America’s national reserves. If properly done, it could also boost the country’s security, long-term economic growth, and leadership in the crypto world.

The token was given out through an airdrop to current NFT holders, attracting interest in the crypto market. In the first hour of trading, according to data from CoinMarketCap , PENGU reached a trading volume of $90 million. Pudgy Penguins PENGU Token Popularity Soaring The airdrop gave 23.5% of PENGU’s total supply to holders of Pudgy Penguins NFTs. It also set aside 22% of the token’s supply for the Solana and Ethereum communities, strengthening its presence on multiple blockchains. To support easy trading, 12.3% of the total supply is reserved for decentralized exchanges. Meanwhile, the PENGU token trades at $0.03875, a 675% increase within 24 hours. PENGU’s successful launch has made Pudgy Penguins very popular, making it the second most valuable NFT collection after CryptoPunks. This launch highlights the growing trend of adding native tokens to existing NFT projects to create larger ecosystems and improve community engagement. PENGU Tokens Soars Following CoinMarketCap Listing Penguiana, the penguin-themed meme coin on the Solana blockchain, witnessed a 70% market valuation surge after CoinMarketCap’s June listing . This significant achievement underscores growing investor confidence. It also marked a pivotal advancement in Penguiana’s journey within the cryptocurrency landscape. $PENGU has broadened its accessibility through listings on prominent decentralized exchanges such as Raydium and Birdeye. These exchanges have facilitated the token’s swift uptake and trading. As Penguiana continues to evolve, the team remains focused on enlarging its ecosystem and deepening community engagement. Safety in the NFT Industry The NFT industry has witnessed significant growth and adoption in recent years. Some digital firms have also leveraged the platform to expand their offerings. For instance, Sony, a maker of gaming consoles, has filed a patent application to move NFTs between different games and platforms. However, with NFTs’ popularity, safety worries have surfaced, especially the safety of the platform used to produce, store, and trade NFTs. Recall that one Ethereum wallet suffered massive losses after selling 500 Moonbirds NFTs . Therefore, prioritizing safety in the NFT industry is critical to protecting users’ investments, preventing hacking or theft of valuable assets, and preserving the industry’s reputation.

If adopted, this move aims to position the United States as a global leader in digital assets. It highlights Bitcoin’s role as “digital gold” and seeks to drive capital inflows, technological adoption, and financial resilience. U.S. Proposes Strategic Bitcoin Reserve Under Trump to Strengthen Economy and Safeguard Dollar The proposal stresses the need for the U.S. to adapt to the growing influence of digital assets in global finance. Bitcoin is a decentralized, finite asset that can strengthen the U.S. economy and safeguard the dollar. The order aims to diversify the ESF’s holdings and secure long-term economic stability by formally designating Bitcoin as a strategic reserve asset. JUST IN: Bitcoin Policy Institute drafts Executive Order for a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve for President Trump pic.twitter.com/bxJHZKa8Ue — Bitcoin Magazine (@BitcoinMagazine) December 17, 2024 The executive order establishes a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve (SBR) to manage Bitcoin as a permanent national asset. The Treasury Secretary would administer it, and strict measures would ensure transparency and accountability. Regular audits, advanced security protocols, and comprehensive reporting would be required to build public confidence. The order calls for consolidating all Bitcoin currently under federal control. Within seven days, agencies like the U.S. Marshal Service would be required to stop selling, auctioning, or transferring Bitcoin. Once legal ownership is confirmed, those holdings would move to the Strategic Bitcoin Reserve. Additionally, the Treasury Secretary would have 60 days to implement an acquisition program to purchase and manage Bitcoin under the ESF. Trump’s Bitcoin Reserve Plan: Will Seized BTC Kickstart a New Financial Era? Bitcoin surged to a record high above $107,000 on Monday after President-elect Donald Trump reaffirmed plans to establish a U.S. bitcoin strategic reserve, igniting enthusiasm among crypto supporters. A strategic reserve is a stockpile of critical resources to stabilize markets during crises. Examples include the U.S. Strategic Petroleum Reserve and China’s reserves of metals and grains. Analysts are divided on whether Trump could create the reserve through an executive order or if Congress must act. Trump hinted the reserve could start with 200,000 seized bitcoins, currently worth around $21 billion. Adding more would require government purchases, potentially funded through debt issuance or selling gold reserves. Senator Cynthia Lummis has proposed legislation for the Treasury to purchase 200,000 BTC annually for five years , funded by Federal Reserve profits and gold holdings. Supporters argue a Bitcoin reserve could help dominate the global market, reduce deficits, and strengthen the U.S. dollar.

Qubetics Is the Best Crypto to Invest in 2024!,https://thecoinrise.com/cardano-left-you-behind-qubetics-is-the-best-crypto-to-invest-in-2024/,"The cryptocurrency market is filled with opportunities, but it’s also easy to miss out. Cardano, one of the most recognised names in crypto, delivered impressive growth for early investors. But if you’re still waiting for the next big thing, it’s time to turn your attention to Qubetics ($TICS) . With an affordable presale price and outstanding real-world applications, Qubetics is quickly becoming the best crypto to invest in 2024. Let’s dive into how Qubetics and Cardano compare and why Qubetics might be the best opportunity to watch this year. Qubetics ($TICS): A Practical Solution with Impressive Returns Qubetics is not just another cryptocurrency looking to make a splash. As the world’s first Web3 aggregator , Qubetics connects real-world businesses and individuals to blockchain technology through efficient, user-friendly solutions. At its core lies an innovative approach to solve global challenges, particularly in secure digital communications and decentralised transactions. Currently, Qubetics is in its 13th presale stage, with tokens priced at just $0.0342. So far, over 350 million tokens have been sold to more than 10,300 holders, raising $6.9 million. These numbers alone make Qubetics one of the best cryptos to invest in 2024, offering massive upside potential for early investors. If you invest $8,500 in Qubetics at $0.0342 per token, analysts predict significant gains. By the end of the presale, when $TICS reaches $0.25, your investment could grow by 630.19% ROI. If the token hits $1 post-presale, that translates to a 2,820.78% ROI. Should Qubetics reach $15 after its mainnet launch, your initial investment could rise to a jaw-dropping $3.7 million. One of Qubetics’ standout features is its decentralised VPN (dVPN). The dVPN ensures privacy and security in an age where digital surveillance is rampant. For professionals like doctors, lawyers, and entrepreneurs, Qubetics’ dVPN offers a private way to manage confidential transactions and sensitive data securely. For individuals, it means safer browsing, enhanced online privacy, and greater control over personal information. With growing concerns about cybersecurity, Qubetics’ dVPN has become a game-changer for both individuals and businesses. This unique blend of practical use cases and investor potential is why Qubetics has earned its place as the best crypto to invest in 2024. By solving real-world problems and bridging the gap between Web3 and traditional industries, Qubetics offers far more than just speculation. It’s a utility-driven investment for the future. Cardano (ADA): A Steady Leader in Blockchain Cardano is one of the most respected projects in the cryptocurrency space. Known for its academic approach to blockchain development, Cardano prioritises security, scalability, and sustainability. It has created a robust ecosystem designed to handle decentralised finance (DeFi), smart contracts, and real-world enterprise solutions. In 2024, Cardano continues to expand its ecosystem. The recent updates to its smart contract platform have improved efficiency and lowered transaction fees. With increased adoption of decentralised applications (dApps), Cardano has attracted developers and businesses seeking secure blockchain solutions. Despite its steady growth, Cardano’s price has remained relatively stable, with analysts predicting modest gains for 2024. While its ecosystem remains robust, its growth rate no longer matches the potential seen in emerging projects like Qubetics. Investors looking for exponential returns may find Qubetics’ presale more appealing than Cardano’s current market position. Conclusion: Qubetics is the Best Crypto to Invest in 2024 If you missed Cardano’s early success, now is your chance to seize a new opportunity. Qubetics ($TICS) is rapidly emerging as the best crypto to invest in 2024, offering affordable entry points, real-world applications like dVPN, and extraordinary ROI potential. With its 13th presale stage still ongoing and tokens priced at $0.0342, Qubetics combines practical blockchain solutions with an investment opportunity that could deliver life-changing returns. For investors seeking the next big winner, Qubetics delivers unmatched potential to outperform established projects like Cardano.

Recent market demand showed renewed spot open interest, as BTC grew to over $108,300, a new price record. Bitcoin (BTC) rallied to its most recent price record as market sentiment shifted to increased spot demand. Analysts noted since October, market influences depended on spot trading, rather than being driven by the derivative market. During earlier bull market stages, open interest on derivative positions was higher, while spot trading and flows to exchanges were slow. In the last quarter of 2024, the BTC Fund Flow Ratio increased its baseline, suggesting a higher inflow of funds to and from exchanges. The BTC fund flow ratio suggest spot exchange activity increased in the last quarter of 2024. | Source: Cryptoquant The fund flow ratio is a metric of on-chain BTC transfers against transfers to exchanges. A more active exchange flow means the focus shifted to spot trading. In the past quarter of 2024, both derivatives and spot trading accelerated. However, as the year comes to a close, spot activity is growing more dominant. Derivative open interest for BTC on major centralized exchanges stalled at around $33B, sinking slightly from its peak. The BTC derivative market goes through cycles of accumulation and liquidation of leveraged positions. Those cycles often boost the price to a new range, causing the liquidation of short positions. With time, interest shifts to additional accumulation on the spot market. Leveraged position accumulation and liquidation cycles are happening at lower levels, without causing significant drawdown events. At the same time, BTC traders often use the spot market to realize short-term gains and reaccumulate. The behavior of short-term trader whales also goes against retail sentiment. As BTC trades above $106,000, retail is bullish, while smart money has turned bearish. Overall, trading behavior shifted the Bitcoin fear and greed index to the ‘extreme greed’ level at 87 points. Demand for actual BTC reserves is rising Demand is rising for owning and controlling BTC in the form of long-term reserves. Instead of leveraged positions, bets on the value of BTC are made by storing coins that are instantly accessible. Demand for physical coins and spot trading led to an increase in the Coinbase premium index . The index has been in the green for most of the past 30-day period. The Coinbase premium index is showing higher demand for spot BTC buying on the US dollar market. The index measures BTC prices on Coinbase against the Binance market, suggesting increased demand for direct buying. Spot trading for BTC also expanded the share of US dollar trading. More than 21% of all BTC volumes are against the US dollar, diminishing the role of stablecoins. Despite the expansion of stablecoins, the dollar-based spot market indicates a shift to direct BTC demand. BTC keeps moving into whale wallets The other major sources for BTC holding are miners, who still own 1.9M coins. ETF buying is also ongoing, retaining even more coins through Coinbase Custody. The third biggest source of demand for BTC comes from corporate buyers, who are buying BTC through new bond issues. This source is also the biggest shift from fiat to crypto ownership, betting on long-term BTC growth. Demand from Bitcoin ETF absorbs most of the physical selling pressure. As older cohorts of holders realize profits, Bitcoin ETF absorbs up to 90% of that selling pressure. Even large-scale whales have easily found liquidity on the market. Demand from MicroStrategy, MARA Holdings, and other corporate buyers is also a significant drain on available coins. Demand far outpaces daily BTC production of just 450 new coins. The current conditions with actual transfers of coins to even larger whale wallets are expected to create a supply crunch. Based on the Rainbow chart , BTC is still in the accumulation zone and possibly far from the cycle top. The next potential levels see BTC test $110,000 and a peak above $125,000.

Salesforce plans to hire 2,000 new salespeople to focus on selling artificial intelligence (AI) products as the company planning to expand its AI offerings. Salesforce to Hire 2,000 Salespeople for AI Expansion CEO Marc Benioff made this announcement during a company event in San Francisco on Tuesday, saying that the demand for AI tools is so high that the company is increasing its hiring plans. “We’re adding another couple of thousand salespeople to help sell these products,” Benioff said. “ We already had 9,000 referrals for the 2,000 positions we’ve opened. It’s amazing.” This announcement makes a big increase from the initial plan. A month ago, Benioff mentioned that Salesforce would hire 1,000 new salespeople for AI roles. The company is now doubling the count as it prepares to release its new AI agent software in February 2025. Salesforce aims to make AI a key part of its product lineup, with AI tools to help sales teams, marketers, and customer service agents do their jobs more efficiently. The new salespeople will help introduce and sell Salesforce’s latest AI technology, including the upcoming second version of its Agentforce platform. This software is designed to create AI-powered agents to handle complex tasks, like answering questions in Salesforce’s Slack app using all available data. The new AI agents will be able to respond to customer queries, making business operations smoother and faster. Benioff is very excited about Salesforce’s potential for AI. In a recent interview, he shared, “I’ve never been more excited about anything at Salesforce, maybe in my career.” He added that he expects the company to have over a billion AI agents within the next year. “This is the most exciting thing that’s happened to Salesforce,” he said. Salesforce’s AI Push Following 2022 Layoffs Salesforce’s move into AI comes after the company laid off over 7,000 employees in 2022. Cutting over 7,000 jobs to adjust to changing economic conditions. As of January 2024, Salesforce had 72,682 employees. Now, the company is focused on hiring more people to increase growth in the AI space. With its new AI agents and expanded sales team, Salesforce is aiming to become a major player in the AI industry.

Coinbase asked a U.S. court to deny BiT Global’s lawsuit in Northern California, which seeks $1 billion in relief and a temporary restraining order on wrapped Bitcoin’s ( wBTC )’s delisting. The Justin Sun-affiliated BiT Global sued Coinbase on Dec. 13 for planning to remove the wrapped Bitcoin ( BTC ) asset from its U.S.-based exchange. BiT Global claimed delisting wBTC was illegal, would cause irreparable harm to the token’s economics, and was unjustified as Coinbase listed unserious cryptocurrencies like meme coins. Also, launching cbBTC breached antitrust laws and threatened to create a Coinbase-controlled monopoly in the tokenized Bitcoin marketplace. The crypto exchange argued that California’s Unfair Competition Law was inapplicable. DefiLlama confirmed that cbBTC ranked outside the top 10 tokenized BTC assets by market capitalization. Coinbase has the right to choose whom to do business with, and no law requires it to allow bad actors or suspected bad actors onto its exchange… Coinbase does not have anything approaching monopoly power, and because its decision to delist wBTC was proper and justified based on the careful review it undertook and the unacceptable risk of doing business with an entity associated with Mr. Sun. Coinbase response to BiT Global lawsuit According to the December 17 court filing, material changes to wBTC’s stewardship, particularly Justin Sun’s majority control of the Bitcoin reserves, prompted Coinbase and other entities to reconsider their support for the asset. You might also like: Sky mulls cutting support for wBTC over Justin Sun affiliations The Securities and Exchange Commission charged Sun and three of his wholly owned companies with federal violations. Additionally, the FBI reportedly opened an inquiry regarding potential terror financing involving Sun. The U.S. Department of Justice has not indicted Sun by publishing time, neither have authorities issued any arrest warrants for the Tron ( TRX ) founder. Coinbase stated that its new wBTC risk assessments, in line with company listing standards, raised red flags, primarily due to Sun’s involvement. The exchange described its decision as “common sense” and necessary to protect its customers. The company also emphasized that delisting wBTC would not impact the token’s overall on-chain activity, which largely takes place on other platforms. Nor can BiT claim harm, let alone irreparable harm, from being delisted from an exchange where less than 1% of transactions involving wBTC are made. Perhaps that is why BiT sat on its claims for nearly a month before filing suit, belying any urgency for relief. The U.S. crypto titan asked the California Court to rule against BiT Global’s TRO request and $1 billion relief package, due to the firm’s ties to an allegedly indictable individual and fabricated emergency regarding wBTC. We've filed our response to BiT Global’s effort to stop our delisting of wBTC before any discovery or even formal response to their bogus claims. We lay out why this lawsuit lacks any semblance of merit and why their request for a TRO should be denied.

Japan is famous for its strict regulation of both the crypto and gaming sectors. Critics, however, say that a “lack of clarity regarding legal regulations, accounting, and taxation issues” have thus far held Japanese firms back from developing blockchain gaming titles. Powerful Partnership? The wider JCBA launched in 2016. Its membership has since grown to 155 firms.

That said, risks remain tilted towards a renewed meme coin pump at any point before the end of the year, or in early 2025. Sentiment remains bullish ahead of the arrival of the Trump administration in the White House in January. A Bitcoin strategic reserve , which seems more and more likely every day right now, could send BTC to the moon. And that could mean rotation into altcoins , including major meme coins.

How High Will Shiba Inu Go? Assuming the Shiba Inu price hits new highs for the year soon, it could soon challenge its record highs in the $0.000090 area soon. Beyond that, a parabolic rally could be in store. A rally towards the 3.618 or 4.236 Fibonacci extension from the 2023 lows back to the 2021 highs suggests gains of as much as 10x from current levels are very possible. That would see Shiba Inu attain a market cap of over $150 billion. That may seem ridiculous, but if Bitcoin hits $200,000, that would see its market cap exceed $4 trillion. In this scenario, SHIB’s market cap would only amount to about 4% of Bitcoin’s, which is to unbelievable when considering its position as a leading meme coin in the market. The near-term future looks very bright for the meme coin space and Shiba Inu, though, as ever, these are incredibly volatile markets. In order to reap big gains, investors also need to be able to HODL through rapid and aggressive downturns.

Metaplanet Inc., often referred to as the “Japanese MicroStrategy,” has announced the issuance of ¥4.5 billion (approximately $30 million) in zero-interest bonds to fund its Bitcoin acquisition strategy. The firm is positioning itself as Asia’s largest corporate Bitcoin holder. The announcement marks Metaplanet’s fourth series of bonds, with a maturity date set for June 16, 2025. The zero-interest bonds will be released in tranches which will allow the company to raise funds for Bitcoin purchases. Metaplanet plans to redeem these bonds through the previously issued warrants, according to reports. Metaplanet’s strategic Bitcoin acquisition plan Since April 2024, Metaplanet has made Bitcoin its treasury reserve asset and has already acquired over 1,150 BTC, worth about $122.67 million. This approach is similar to MicroStrategy’s Bitcoin reserve. Metaplanet’s new bond issuance is to speed up its Bitcoin buying strategy specifically to purchase more Bitcoin. By issuing zero-interest bonds, Metaplanet avoids short-term financial stress while using the funds to grow its assets. Investors benefit because these bonds are sold at a discount but pay the full value at maturity. The bond issuance news resulted in a 51% surge in Metaplanet’s stock price over the past five trading sessions. Shares reached an all-time high of 4,270 JPY, increasing the company’s market capitalization beyond the $1 billion mark. Over 27.8 billion yen (~$180 million) worth of Metaplanet shares was traded, showing the company’s ability to capitalize on its Bitcoin-centric approach. Even Simon Gerovich, CEO of Metaplanet, acknowledged the market’s overwhelming response. Metaplanet plans to issue additional private placement bonds worth up to ¥5 billion to expand its Bitcoin reserves. These bonds are to be issued in partnership with EVO FUND. The proceeds from the bond issuances will also be allocated exclusively for Bitcoin purchases, reinforcing Metaplanet’s long-term vision. Shareholder rewards program in Bitcoin In addition to its bold investment moves, the company also announced a Bitcoin rewards program. The company announced a 30-million-yen ($199,500) prize pool, which will reward shareholders who own at least 100 shares as of December 31, 2024. Through a lottery system, 2,350 selected shareholders will receive varying amounts of Bitcoin.

Santa Rides Shiba (SANTSHIB), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 19,000% in price in the coming days. This is because SANTSHIB is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Santa Rides Shiba can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Santa Rides Shiba could become the next viral memecoin. Santa Rides Shiba launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Santa Rides Shiba on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Santa Rides Shiba by entering its contract address – CxpeR8vdgeVWZFwBytS7PRrXHBwVgPJWZBJUcpK3k7vT – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like SANTSHIB.

Analysts speculate that this critical support level will be a bounce-off point for the Dogecoin price to reach $4 . However, in the shadow of the Dogecoin price’s hype, many top investors are putting their money into a new altcoin, WallitIQ (WLTQ) . Why? This AI altcoin, in the second presale stage, is priced at just $0.0243 and has the potential to outpace Dogecoin in reaching the $4 price milestone. WallitIQ (WLTQ) Will Beat The Dogecoin Price To The $4 Mark A technical analysis of the Dogecoin price reveals that Dogecoin (DOGE) has sustained a crucial uptrend line. This trend line has acted as support, with the Dogecoin price consistently bouncing off without going below. Market data highlights strong buyer interest at these levels, as each dip towards the trend line has been met with renewed confidence and buying activity. Yet, top investors consider WallitIQ (WLTQ) the most promising altcoin of 2025 and have been investing massively in this new AI altcoin. Despite its modest presale price, WallitIQ (WLTQ) has a compelling value proposition that could see it leapfrog over Dogecoin and win the race to $4. At $0.0243 , WallitIQ (WLTQ) provides an unbeatable entry point compared to the Dogecoin price at $0.4098 . For investors, this means the ability to accumulate significantly more tokens with less capital. WallitIQ (WLTQ) Offering Practical Solutions That Drive Adoption For just $0.0243 , WallitIQ (WLTQ) offers an affordable entry point for investors seeking massive returns. While the Dogecoin price movements heavily rely on market sentiment, WallitIQ’s (WLTQ) growth is driven by its utility and adoption in DeFi solutions. Its practical solutions to everyday crypto problems and innovative features drive rapid adoption. WallitIQ (WLTQ) has already shown signs of massive adoption. In just a few weeks, the project has raised over $2.7 million in presale revenue, attracting investors eager to purchase the AI altcoin at its discounted price. With predictions of a potential 55,000% increase in value, WallitIQ (WLTQ) has already secured a listing on CoinMarketCap and is preparing for exchange listings in 2025. While Dogecoin (DOGE) has Elon Musk’s tweets as its wild card, WallitIQ (WLTQ)’s growth is underpinned by strong fundamentals. The team behind the project has demonstrated a commitment to security and an unforgettable use experience. WallitIQ (WLTQ) prioritizes security with advanced AI-powered anomaly detection to monitor activity and quickly identify potential threats. Further enhancing its credibility, WallitIQ (WLTQ) subjected one of its smart contracts to a rigorous audit by SolidProof, ensuring a secure and reliable system. Holders of WallitIQ (WLTQ) altcoin can enjoy multiple benefits, including using the altcoin to pay transaction fees, earning staking rewards of up to 180% APY, accessing premium features, and taking advantage of unlimited referral bonuses and community rewards. At such a low price of $0.0243, even a modest increase in value can generate significant gains, making it an ideal investment for those looking to maximize returns. Why You Should Act Now While the Dogecoin price predictions of $4 are tempting, WallitIQ (WLTQ) offers a low-risk, high-reward proposition that investors cannot ignore.

37776413,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=663540,1734480059,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/newsbtc.png,Analyst Who Correctly Predicted The Fantom Breakout Above $1 Reveals What’s Next In The Parabolic Trend,https://www.newsbtc.com/news/fantom/fantom-breakout-above-1-trend/,"A crypto analyst on TradingView, known as ‘Tradecitypro,’ has published a detailed Fantom (FTM) report, breaking down the cryptocurrency’s price action across the daily and 4-hour timeframe. After accurately predicting Fantom‘s surge above $1, the analyst highlights key price levels, market trends, potential price movements, and bullish technical indicators for FTM’s next parabolic trend. Fantom Daily Timeframe: Signs Of Trend Weakness After correctly forecasting FTM’s price breakout at $0.84, the TradingView analyst has revealed that the cryptocurrency is now following a parabolic uptrend, supported by a curved ascending trendline. According to the analyst, Fantom’s price has reacted multiple times to this distinctive trendline, ending price corrections and resuming its upward momentum. During the last bullish surge during Fantom’s uptrend, the cryptocurrency broke past the 0.7707 resistance and rose to the weekly resistance zone at 1.1116, where it stabilized above that level. Moreover, several indicators suggest that FTM may be slowing down and losing momentum. Its candle sizes have been gradually shrinking, indicating reduced bullish activity. Additionally, price corrections have intensified, signaling increased selling pressures and potential profit-taking. Fantom’s trading volume has also declined, suggesting that traders’ interests might shift. Another technical indicator that is currently bearish is the Relative Strength Index (RSI), which is showing signs of divergence, signaling a potential reversal of the price of FTM drops below 55.74 on the RSI. Looking ahead, the TradingView analyst has revealed that a notable sign of sharp bullish trends and pre-pump movements is when a cryptocurrency exhibits weakness and a potential for a price reversal. If the current bearish trend for Fantom continues, the analyst has set the first minor resistance level at 1.6218. Additionally, if FTM can maintain a stable price above this zone, its next and strongest resistance could be at 3.2506. This resistance zone is near FTM’s all-time high of $3.46, representing a significant supply region. On the other hand, if FTM experiences a price correction, it would likely drop to the first support at the curved trendline. If the trendline is broken, the next price levels to watch are 1.1116 and 0.7707. A sustained price decline below 0.7707 would invalidate the previous bullish scenario for Fantom, potentially pushing the price further down to between 0.5349 and 0.2928. 4-Hour Timeframe: Ascending Channel And Potential Breakouts In the 4-hour timeframe, the TradingView analyst revealed that Fantom is currently moving within an Ascending Channel. The cryptocurrency’s price is interacting with the midline of the channel, providing temporary support. The analyst has revealed that no significant moves will be expected if Fantom remains within this Ascending channel. However, if the cryptocurrency can break out, it could lead to two potential scenarios: the start of a new parabolic trend or a trend exhaustion due to a loss in bullish momentum. The TradingView analyst has identified the price level at 1.636 as Fantom’s next static resistance. However, if FTM’s price has not yet reached this zone, the analyst suggests a safer strategy of taking long positions based on Dow Theory and channel breakouts.

Feels good, right? Well, the market’s buzzing with three coins that might just get you there. BTFD Coin (BTFD) is shaking up the scene with its massive presale momentum, Play-to-Earn (P2E) game, and unbeatable community vibe. At the same time, Brett (BRETT) and COQ Inu (COQ) are making waves in the meme coin world with explosive gains and strong blockchain integration. If you’re scouting the best meme coins to buy for 2025, you’ve landed at the right spot. Let’s break down what makes these three coins worth watching, with a laser focus on BTFD Coin, the presale powerhouse currently turning heads across the crypto space. BTFD Coin (BTFD): A Presale Powerhouse You Don’t Want to Miss BTFD Coin is not just a meme; it’s a movement. Launched with the ethos of “Buy The F**ing Dip,”* BTFD has turned the legendary investment mantra into a full-blown ecosystem that rewards early movers. Since the presale kicked off at just $0.000004 per coin, it’s been nothing but up. Now in Stage 12, the price has hit $0.00013, with the coin set to list at $0.0006 at the end of the presale. Here’s the jaw-dropper: BTFD has raised over $4.1 million, with more than 56 billion coins sold and 5,700+ holders already on board. That’s what you call momentum. If you’re wondering, “How much could I earn?”, let’s do the maths. Say you invest $1,000 right now in Stage 12. At $0.00013 per coin, you’ll bag a staggering 7.69 million BTFD coins. When the presale ends and the price hits $0.0006, your $1,000 investment could balloon to $4,615. And that’s just the start. But BTFD isn’t just about hype. The project has actual substance with its Beta P2E game now live. You can join the Bulls Squad, tackle levels, and get a taste of what’s to come. Rewards aren’t live in the Beta yet, but this sneak peek is proof that BTFD is building something solid. Add to that staking rewards with an average 90% APY and it’s clear why investors are loading up their bags. Oh, and did I mention the BTFD Coin Referral Program? Share your referral code and earn 10% of the raise amount in BTFD tokens if you make the top 20 leaderboard. Your friends get an extra 10% BTFD when they spend $50 or more. Everybody wins. With Ethereum as its backbone and liquidity locked for three years, BTFD isn’t messing around. This isn’t just a meme coin; it’s a full-on ecosystem, primed for 2025’s bull run. If you’ve been hunting for the best meme coins to buy for 2025, don’t miss this dip. BTFD is your golden ticket. Brett (BRETT): The Rising Star on Base Chain Let’s talk about Brett (BRETT), a meme coin that’s captured hearts and wallets alike. Inspired by its Base Chain integration, Brett has proven that it’s more than just a flash in the pan. Trading at $0.1749 with a market cap of $1.8 billion, Brett’s price has doubled since November 2024, showing strong momentum in the competitive meme coin space. What’s driving this growth? A combination of strategic exchange listings and solid community support. Major exchanges have opened their doors to Brett, bringing more liquidity and visibility to the project. There’s also mounting speculation that Brett might score listings on Binance and Coinbase, which would catapult its popularity even further. Despite the high volatility (par for the course with meme coins), Brett’s trajectory is hard to ignore. Its recent performance and integration with Base Chain make it a strong contender among the best meme coins to buy for 2025. Whether it’s the next Pepe or something even bigger remains to be seen, but Brett has certainly earned its spot on this list. COQ Inu (COQ): Avalanche’s Meme Coin King Over on the Avalanche blockchain, COQ Inu (COQ) is quietly stealing the show. Priced at $0.000002373 with a market cap of $162 million, COQ Inu has firmly established itself as Avalanche’s top meme coin. Boasting a 24-hour trading volume of $20.44 million, it’s clear that COQ Inu isn’t just a niche project—it’s a growing phenomenon. COQ Inu’s secret sauce lies in its transparency and tokenomics. The team has burned liquidity and renounced contracts, ensuring the community’s trust in the project. Combine that with Avalanche’s low fees and lightning-fast transactions, and COQ Inu offers a compelling alternative to Ethereum-based meme coins. Market sentiment has been a major driver here. COQ Inu’s recent recognition among high-ROI meme coins has attracted investors seeking the next big win. With its unique position in the Avalanche ecosystem and its commitment to decentralisation, COQ Inu is certainly one of the best meme coins to buy for 2025 if you’re looking to diversify beyond Ethereum. Final Thoughts: Don’t Miss Out on BTFD Coin’s Presale With 2025 just around the corner, the race to snag the best meme coins to buy for 2025 is heating up. BTFD Coin (BTFD) stands out as the clear front-runner, with its explosive presale success, P2E game, and community-driven vision. Raising over $4.1 million and counting, BTFD is shaping up to be the ultimate early-mover opportunity for investors ready to ride the bull run. At the same time, Brett (BRETT) is surging ahead on Base Chain, and COQ Inu (COQ) continues to dominate Avalanche with its transparent, low-fee model. Each of these projects offers something unique, but if you’re after a game-changing investment, BTFD Coin deserves your attention. Don’t let this opportunity pass you by. Join the BTFD presale now, stack your bags, and prepare to ride the bull into 2025. Timing is everything—and this is your moment to buy the f***ing dip.

Tether has invested strategically in StablR, a European startup focused on euro-denominated stablecoins. This partnership is to increase the use of stablecoins across Europe, especially with the European Union’s new regulations on digital assets set to take effect in 2024. Why Is This Investment Important? Stablecoins are digital currencies pegged to real-world assets like the US dollar or euro. They offer stability and making them less volatile than other cryptocurrencies. Tether’s investment in StablR is the sign of company’s commitment to promoting stablecoins in Europe, particularly as the region prepares for the upcoming Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA) regulation, which will regulate cryptocurrencies and stablecoins in the EU. StablR, which has already received a license in Malta to issue MiCA-compliant stablecoins and will use Tether’s tokenization platform, Hadron , to facilitate the conversion of traditional assets into digital tokens. By converting it will allow businesses to create digital versions of stocks, bonds, commodities, and more while complying with legal regulations on the whole. StablR’s Role and the Future of Stablecoins StablR offers two types of stablecoins: EURR , which is pegged to the euro, and USDR , which is pegged to the US dollar. Both stablecoins are available on popular blockchain networks like ERC-20 and Solana , and transactions on different platforms. With the help of Tether’s platform, StablR plans to expand its offerings and make stablecoins available on more blockchain networks, allowing even more people and businesses to use them. The stablecoin market is growing especially in countries with unstable economies, Europe is also showing increased interest, with many looking for alternatives to traditional banking systems. Tether’s investment in StablR comes as crypto exchanges adapt to new regulations in Europe (MiCA) that require stablecoin issuers to meet strict compliance and transparency standards. Tether’s investment in StablR helps bring stablecoins like EURR and USDR into Europe’s financial system. With Tether’s support, this partnership makes stablecoins easier to use and ensures they follow the rules in digital currencies.

Related Reading: The $589 XRP Dream: Believers Aren’t ‘Delusional’ Enough, Expert Says The study indicates that in the third quarter of 2024 Solana’s ecosystem funding reached $173 million, the highest level since mid-2022. This money flow shows a strong conviction in Solana’s ability to be the top blockchain platform. Solana: Key Drivers Of Growth One of the key reasons for this positive prognosis is the upcoming introduction of a spot SOL Exchange-Traded Fund (ETF). As regulatory conditions improve, experts predict that institutional investors will flock to Solana, increasing its market position. We are so back!

Jump into the full report now ⬇️ pic.twitter.com/AzOZhiAib5 — Messari (@MessariCrypto) December 16, 2024 The introduction of a spot ETF might result in considerable financial inflows, placing Solana as a viable competitor to other cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin and Ethereum. Moreover, ongoing improvements to Solana’s infrastructure are anticipated to augment its performance. Jump Trading’s Firedancer client pledges to enhance transaction velocities and network scalability. The preliminary implementation has commenced, with complete deployment anticipated in 2025. This enhancement will broaden client alternatives while bolstering network security by reducing dependence on a singular codebase. Institutional Interest And Market Sentiment Reflecting the increasing institutional interest in Solana, companies like VanEck and Bitwise have lately registered for a spot SOL ETF. This action points to Solana’s unique value proposition as a high-performance blockchain starting to be acknowledged by conventional finance. If this tendency keeps up, many predict SOL’s price would soar to new heights; some even project it may hit $4,000. Solana’s market attitude remains positive, particularly after it just went past the $220 price level. If the movement continues, analysts anticipate SOL will reach its previous all-time high of $263. The combination of increased capital, technological breakthroughs and institutional support fosters Solana’s expansion.

In a new video update, Guy Turner, the host of CoinBureau, tells his 2.57 million YouTube subscribers that the market cap for Pyth Network ( PYTH ) may eventually soar due to its potential to generate massive fee revenue. “In my opinion, Pyth Network is one of the most underrated cryptos there is. That’s because it’s an oracle that provides high-frequency data feeds that blockchains like Solana depend on. In other words, Pyth Network is like Chainlink, and some would argue that it’s better than Chainlink. That’s because Pyth Network technically has its own blockchain called Pyth Net, which could theoretically leverage the PYTH token for fees someday. This could make PYTH bigger than LINK, which is already pretty darn big. For the time being, though, PYTH continues to fly under the radar, which is good news for those looking to get in early, but bad news for those who have already been accumulating for a while.” PYTH is trading for $0.49 at time of writing, up 7% in the last 24 hours. With a market cap of $1.79 billion, PYTH is the 83rd largest crypto project. Meanwhile, LINK is trading for $29.08 at time of writing, up slightly on the day. With a market cap of $18.21 billion, LINK is the 13th largest crypto project.

BTC 5-month price chart | Source: crypto.news BTC’s rally follows President-elect Donald Trump’s proposal to establish a U.S. Bitcoin strategic reserve, a concept that has sparked widespread excitement across markets. Trump’s announcement, made during his speech at the New York Stock Exchange on December 12, aims to position the U.S. ahead of global competitors in the digital asset space. He pointed to the need for America to “do something great with crypto” and to build reserves similar to its existing strategic oil stockpile. The idea of a Bitcoin reserve isn’t entirely new. It was first introduced through the BITCOIN Act, championed by Republican Senator Cynthia Lummis, which envisions the U.S. acquiring 1 million BTC over the next five years to help address the growing $35 trillion national debt. Another major factor driving this surge has been institutional activity, particularly from MicroStrategy, a firm synonymous with aggressive Bitcoin accumulation. In the past week alone, MicroStrategy announced it had purchased $1.5 billion worth of BTC at an average price of $100,386 per coin. This recent acquisition brings its total Bitcoin holdings to 439,000 BTC, valued at around $47 billion. The company’s Bitcoin strategy has paid off immensely, catapulting its market cap from $1.1 billion in 2020 to nearly $100 billion today. Moreover, MicroStrategy’s inclusion in the Nasdaq 100 index, effective next week, is also expected to boost further demand for its stock as funds and ETFs rebalance their portfolios. Meanwhile, Ethereum ( ETH ) hasn’t been left behind in this crypto frenzy. After a period of stagnation, ETH showed strong signs of life, climbing to a seven-day high of $4,106 on December 16—a 6% weekly gain. While Ethereum has faced some minor retracement due to profit booking, it remains steady around the $3,950 mark as of this writing. ETH 6-month price chart | Source: crypto.news Let’s dive deeper into the key developments driving Bitcoin and Ethereum, analyze the macroeconomic indicators shaping this bull run, and see what experts believe could happen in the days to come. Institutional powerplay Bitcoin and Ethereum are both showing strong momentum, but the underlying story becomes clearer when we look at ETF inflows, liquidations, and futures open interest. Spot Bitcoin ETFs have been on a tear this month. Since December began, they’ve seen consistent inflows every single day, adding over $5.16 billion as of Dec. 16. These inflows have pushed the total assets under management for Bitcoin ETFs to $123 billion — a strong signal of confidence, especially from institutional investors. Ethereum ETFs, however, tell a different story. Between their launch on Jul. 23 and Dec. 3, inflows were modest, reaching just $733.6 million. Compared to Bitcoin’s performance, this figure looks miniscule. But momentum has clearly shifted. Since Dec. 4, Ethereum ETFs have seen consistent inflows, adding $1.58 billion in a matter of days, suggesting that investors are warming up to Ethereum, likely encouraged by its price performance and Bitcoin’s strong market lead. Liquidation data adds more context to what’s happening in the market. Over the last 24 hours, as of Dec. 17, $339 million worth of positions were liquidated across the crypto market, with $205 million in longs and $134 million in shorts wiped out. 24-hour liquidation heatmap | Source: CoinGlass For Bitcoin, total liquidations have been around $60 million, with short positions making up the majority at $30 million, compared to $29 million from longs, suggesting that many traders betting against Bitcoin’s rally were forced out of their positions as BTC climbed past $108,000. Ethereum saw even heavier liquidations, totaling $78.5 million, with shorts again taking a larger hit at $52 million, again reflecting how ETH’s recent price push to $4,100 surprised many bearish traders. Meanwhile, Bitcoin’s futures open interest — the total value of outstanding futures contracts — has seen monumental growth . Back in early October, open interest sat at $32 billion. Following Trump’s election victory and the resulting bullish sentiment, that figure grew rapidly, reaching $55 billion by mid-November. Since then, open interest has continued to climb, hitting a massive $70 billion as of December 17. Rising open interest paired with increasing prices is a bullish signal, as it shows new money flowing into the market and traders placing bets on further upside. Put simply, Bitcoin’s rally isn’t running on fumes. ETF inflows are strong, futures activity is rising, and short sellers are being squeezed out of their positions. Ethereum, while slower to catch up, is now benefiting from the same momentum, with growing ETF inflows and shorts being liquidated. Both assets appear to have solid footing for their current uptrends, with institutional money and futures markets aligning to paint a bullish picture. Macroeconomic crosswinds The broader macroeconomic environment is currently a mixed bag, with a weakening U.S. Dollar, rate cut expectations, and political turbulence in Europe creating uncertainty across global markets. The USD, which had been gaining strength for a while, is now stalling. The November Retail Sales figure came in at 0.7%, beating expectations of 0.5%, but it wasn’t enough to inspire confidence . Excluding cars and transportation, growth was a weak 0.2%, below the forecasted 0.4%. Add to that the downward revisions for previous months, and it suggests consumer spending — the engine of the U.S. economy — is slowing. This ties directly to the Federal Reserve. The market expects a 25-basis-point rate cut on Dec. 18 with almost certainty. However, the Fed’s tone has been cautious about 2025. Expectations of aggressive rate cuts in the future are being dialed back, which has kept the Dollar from falling further. A stronger Dollar generally puts downward pressure on riskier assets, including Bitcoin, because investors often see USD as a safer bet. But now that the Dollar’s rally is pausing, it gives crypto some breathing room. At the same time, U.S. industrial production contracted by 0.1% in November when analysts expected growth of 0.3%, which signals that certain sectors of the economy are struggling. Combine that with sluggish equity markets — Asian and European stocks are down, and U.S. futures are sliding by around 1% — and we see a general lack of enthusiasm for traditional investments. Historically, when traditional assets underperform, and inflation remains under control, capital starts flowing into alternatives like Bitcoin. However, an overall bearish outlook can add choppiness and halt the bullish sentiments. Meanwhile, political instability in Germany — where Chancellor Olaf Scholz lost a confidence vote — and lingering economic troubles in France are weakening the Euro. Since the Euro makes up 58% of the U.S. Dollar Index, this directly supports the Dollar. However, global uncertainty often drives investors to look for assets that are independent of governments and central banks, like Bitcoin. Amid this, the U.S. 10-year Treasury yield has pulled back slightly to 4.38%, down from its recent high of 4.43%. If yields continue to fall and rate cuts accelerate, it becomes cheaper to borrow money, and investors will start looking for higher returns elsewhere. Bitcoin and Ethereum could likely benefit in these scenarios because they’re seen as high-return alternatives, especially when confidence in traditional markets is shaky. However, nothing is guaranteed. What do experts think? The ongoing Bitcoin and Ethereum rallies are creating the kind of setup that has historically led to explosive price movements. While the momentum is strong, there are signals investors should watch closely. One of the most key observations is Bitcoin’s tightening supply dynamics. As Quinten pointed out, “BlackRock eating up 9x daily mining supply,” — a clear indication that institutional investors are snapping up Bitcoin faster than it can be mined. BlackRock eating up 9x daily mining supply Supply shock incoming and normies still sleeping Institutional FOMO just starting — Quinten | 048.eth (@QuintenFrancois) December 17, 2024 With spot Bitcoin ETFs now giving institutions easy access to BTC, the supply shock narrative is gaining traction. If institutions continue to accumulate at this rate, a supply squeeze could amplify BTC’s next leg up. Meanwhile, Ethereum is showing its own signs of structural strength. According to Ali Martinez, in previous bull cycles, Ethereum’s parabolic runs occurred when long-term holders shifted from the belief phase into “greed mode.” In the past two bull cycles, #Ethereum $ETH went parabolic when long-term holders shifted into greed mode. Right now, they’re only in the early stages of the belief phase. The big move could still be ahead! pic.twitter.com/warxPOlSFj — Ali (@ali_charts) December 17, 2024 Right now, Ethereum is still in the early stages of belief, suggesting that the big move for ETH may still be ahead, aligning with Ethereum’s recent price performance, as it quietly climbed toward $4,000 after months of stagnation. Adding to this picture is Bitcoin’s MVRV ratio — a widely followed valuation tool. The MVRV ratio compares Bitcoin’s market value (its current market cap) to its realized value (average acquisition price based on on-chain data). Historical patterns show that BTC’s MVRV ratio peaked at 4.7x in 2017 and 4x in 2021. As Presto Research outlines , applying a conservative 3.5x multiple to Bitcoin’s projected realized value of $1.2 trillion by Q3 2025 could put BTC’s network value at $4.2 trillion — or about $210,000 per Bitcoin. However, the path to these price levels won’t be smooth. As Michaël van de Poppe noted, the Federal Reserve’s upcoming meeting introduces a key wildcard. New all-time high for #Bitcoin and a liquidity sweep for $ETH . FED Meeting around the corner, which is likely going to bring a ton of volatility into the markets. I won't be surprised we'll see $110K and $95K in the same week. — Michaël van de Poppe (@CryptoMichNL) December 16, 2024 While a rate cut is expected, the Fed’s commentary could trigger volatility. Bitcoin has often responded sharply to central bank decisions, as monetary policy directly impacts liquidity in financial markets. In Poppe’s words, “I won’t be surprised we’ll see $110K and $95K in the same week.” If Bitcoin’s rally extends further and investor confidence spreads, Ethereum’s historical tendency to lag behind and then catch up could play out again. To put it all together, the current rally has strong foundations: institutional demand, shrinking supply, and improving market sentiment. However, volatility remains a given, especially with the Fed’s decisions looming and macro uncertainties still in play. While the data points to a bullish path, managing risk is key as we move deeper into this cycle. Always remember the golden rule: never invest more than you can afford to lose.

Musk Loves Bitcoin (MUSKBTC), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 13,000% in price in the coming days. This is because MUSKBTC is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Musk Loves Bitcoin can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Musk Loves Bitcoin could become the next viral memecoin. Musk Loves Bitcoin launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Musk Loves Bitcoin on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Musk Loves Bitcoin by entering its contract address – 35GthqqwTd9HokNVfUzGpjsALCJbeUXXeKeJcrPCZsJB – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like MUSKBTC. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Press Releases,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|DOGE|SHIB|SOL,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2024-12-18 01:22:00

A new report from Nikkei details how BTC can sometimes be taxed at as much as 110%, as industry leaders and crypto advocates on the archipelago scramble desperately to get the government’s greasy fingers out of Satoshi’s wallet. According to Microstrategy’s Michael Saylor, it’s only “ paranoid crypto-anarchists ” who are worried about keeping bitcoin and government separate, or being able to use crypto non-custodially and permissionlessly. But for the Japanese, holding bitcoin and other crypto assets has now become a huge liability — thanks solely to the state. If we consult the creator of bitcoin themselves, Satoshi Nakamoto, we see that the whole project was always meant to be electronic cash that doesn’t require a financial institution or third party; this is something now coming to bitter remembrance for those Japanese who had wished for the state to get more involved. How Bitcoin can be taxed at over 100% in Japan Of course there is debate about taxation in pretty much every country. And when it comes down to brass tacks, there is no getting around that it is money taken (usually without one’s express consent) under threat of force, and then spent on whatever the strangers in political office far away want to spend it on. Like it or not, it’s theft. Still, to avoid being caged, most people understandably pay the extortion fees out of self-preservation. But in Japan, things are getting out of control for even the most happily obedient normie. While the leader of the Democratic Party for the People (DPP), Yuichiro Tamaki, has been fighting alongside industry groups to get a separate 20% tax for crypto in place, the country’s new prime minister seems uninterested. PM Shigeru Ishiba recently went so far as to publicly doubt the legitimacy of bitcoin as an asset and to imply that tax reform would be promoting a scam to the public. So the possibility of being taxed at up to 55% on gains in Japan remains in place. But the nightmare doesn’t end there. Enter: the inheritance tax. A new report from Japanese financial media outlet Nikkei details how in some cases, people might be taxed for even more bitcoin value than they got in the first place. The December 18 piece describes how the inheritance tax, combined with other taxes, could result in someone being taxed at 110%. Here’s the hypothetical breakdown: Someone buys 100 BTC in December 2014 (worth 4.6 million JPY). They die in December 2024, leaving the BTC (now valued at 1.437 billion JPY) to their child. The child must pay an inheritance tax maxed out at 55%. The heir then sells the BTC upon inheriting it, and must pay taxes on gains, with the acquisition price still being the original 4.6 million yen. Combine the two 55% taxes and others (inheritance tax, income tax, and local resident tax) and the child is now taxed at a rate higher than the value of the asset itself, or 110%. The article goes on to note that even in cases where less value is involved, rates can still reach 100%, and details that even small gains in crypto can end up being taxed at rates higher than those of stocks. “Even if the profit from selling virtual currency is small, there are many cases where the tax rate is higher than stocks,” the article by Tomoko Ōga states. “If the income amount subject to comprehensive taxation is 3.3 million yen or more but less than 6.95 million yen, the maximum income tax rate is 20% and the local resident tax is 10%, which is higher than the total of 20% for separate declaration taxation.” Perhaps there was something to that permissionless exchange thing after all, but each day the state gets more involved, the very real stakes and threats of punishment are jacked up higher and higher. Thankfully, this results in even more innovation and development of efficient P2P (peer-to-peer) protocols so peaceful people can use their money freely and efficiently, without having to be extorted of their inheritance or pay for war. But then again, maybe they are just being paranoid.

His insights come at a time when the crypto market has experienced significant growth, and after Bitwise released its annual top 10 crypto predictions for the next year. #1 Bitcoin Structured Products Surge Park predicts that by 2025, Bitcoin structured products will see an asset influx of at least $5 billion. He states, “The cold, hard truth is that most private wealth managers and institutions remain hesitant about taking on directional Bitcoin exposure.” Related Reading: Crypto Watchlist: Top 5 Coins To Watch This Week He elaborates that products like buffered notes and principal-protection ETFs will be pivotal in bridging this gap, offering tailored exposure to Bitcoin’s volatility to meet institutional preferences. “I predict that buffered notes, principal-protection ETFs, and similar instruments will unlock a floodgate of new demand, giving institutions access to Bitcoin’s volatility at the price they deserve, customized to their own preferences,” Park remarks. #2 Maple Finance Outpaces BlackRock’s BUIDL With a total value locked (TVL) of approximately $535 million as of his writing, Park believes Maple Finance will surpass BlackRock’s BUIDL project. He argues, “I hold an unapologetic view that decentralized markets, which enable novel financial primitives, will see adoption faster than ‘security tokenization’ projects retrofitting to legacy infrastructure.” Park sees decentralized lending platforms like Maple Finance, which provide institutional-grade services, as the category winners in the near future, potentially aided by favorable regulatory changes under the incoming Trump administration. “Institutional-grade, crypto-asset-backed decentralized lending like Maple Finance remains the most promising near-term category winner, bolstered by potential regulatory tailwinds,” Park forecasts. #3 Emergence Of A New Decentralized Crypto Stablecoin Despite past failures like LUNA, Park anticipates the rise of a new decentralized stablecoin backed by a decentralized strategic reserve. He asserts, “Bitcoin’s role as a reserve asset is now undeniable, spanning corporate balance sheets to nation-states,” but emphasizes the crypto community’s desire for a reserve that is “decentralized free from sovereign whims at all costs.” Related Reading: Crypto Market Hit Hard With $1.7 Billion Liquidated, Largest Event Since 2021 The new stablecoin, he predicts, will leverage heightened transparency and cryptographic proofs, aiming to restore trust and utility in decentralized finance. “Despite the scars left by LUNA, I predict a more robust effort will rise, built with heightened transparency and leveraging the long-awaited arrival of cryptographic proofs. I have some exemplary candidates in mind that can and will lead the way,” he states. These predictions by Park come after the predictions from Bitwise for 2025. The firm has projected Bitcoin to exceed $200,000, driven by institutional investment and ETF inflows. Ethereum and Solana are also expected to reach new all-time highs, further solidifying the growth narrative in the crypto space. Additionally, Bitwise sees 2025 as potentially becoming the “Year of the Crypto IPO,” with several crypto unicorns expected to go public in the US. At press time, Bitcoin traded at $106,794.

This development provides a bullish outlook for the Dogecoin price, which is currently consolidating. However, rival token ETFSwap (ETFS) provides a better opportunity for investors as it will enjoy a 70,000% rally in 18 days. Dogecoin Price Could Replicate 2021 Bull Pattern In an X post , Trader Tardigrade raised the possibility of the Dogecoin price replicating a bullish pattern from the 2021 market cycle. This bullish pattern led to a 30,000% surge in the Dogecoin price back then, suggesting that DOGE could again enjoy such price gains in this market cycle. The analyst’s accompanying chart showed that the Dogecoin price could reach as high as $16 if it replicates the 2021 bull pattern. The chart also showed that the Dogecoin price surge to $16 could happen sometime next year. However, despite this bullish outlook for the Dogecoin price, it looks almost impossible for DOGE to reach this target based on its circulating supply. A Dogecoin price surge to $16 will give DOGE a market cap of $2.3 trillion, which is almost impossible at the moment, considering that the crypto market is just valued at over $2 trillion. Why Investors Should Buy ETFSwap (ETFS) Which Will Rally 70,000% Investors are better off buying the ETFSwap (ETFS) token, which will rally 70,000% in 18 days. This bullish outlook for the token stems from its incredible utility, which is already gaining much attention. ETFS is the native token of the ETFSwap platform, which tokenizes exchange-traded funds (ETFs) and enables them to be traded on-chain. The ETFSwap (ETFS) token provides an easier and more convenient way to trade these traditional assets since investors simply need to convert the token for their desired ETF. This explains why traditional finance (TradFi) investors have been looking to purchase as many coins as possible since ETFS got listed on the Uniswap decentralized exchange (DEX). The massive demand for the token so far will contribute to the projected 70,000% rally in 18 days. This is why investors who have yet to invest need to hurry and buy as many coins as possible to position for this price surge. ETFSwap’s (ETFS) other use cases prove that the token can indeed witness this parabolic rally. The ETFSwap (ETFS) token provides access to crypto assets and other commodities on the ETFSwap platform including gold, silver, rubber, cotton, and crude oil, among others. Users will simply swap the token for their desired asset. This makes portfolio diversification much easier as investors will now be able to gain access to several asset classes in one place. As such, it is best to get ahead of these investors and accumulate as many coins as possible. The ETFS token is deflationary , which is another reason it could easily rally by 70,000% and outperform the Dogecoin price. The ETFSwap (ETFS) team has committed to burning some of the fees earned on the DeFi platform to buy back and burn as many ETFS tokens as possible. This deflationary mechanism makes it easier for the ETFSwap (ETFS) price to surge, especially considering the massive demand that the token is already witnessing. Conclusion The ETFSwap (ETFS) token is set to be listed on major exchanges in the coming weeks. It is best to front-run these listings as the 70,000% rally could begin as soon as these exchanges ETFS. Moreover, these exchanges will begin to accumulate ETFS ahead of the listing, so it is best to hurry and accumulate the coin. Buying the ETFSwap (ETFS) token means that you get to enjoy as much as a 700x return on investment (ROI). This is definitely an opportunity to make life-changing gains and one you shouldn’t pass on in this bull run.

One minute, they’re trending, and the next, they’re surging in price. The meme coin space is as fast-moving as a TikTok trend, and if you’re not careful, you could miss out on the next big thing. Lucky for you, we’re here to make sure that doesn’t happen. Whether you’re looking for the best meme coins to buy now or just trying to keep up with the latest movements in the meme coin world, we’ve got the lowdown on three big players: BTFD Coin, Notcoin, and Book of Meme. Just this week, BTFD Coin hit a major PR milestone, racking up over $4.1 million in presale funds. At a presale price of $0.00013, it’s safe to say that investors are paying attention. And who can blame them? This meme coin isn’t just meme-driven; it has real utility with its upcoming Play-to-Earn (P2E) game, staking rewards, and a community-first mentality. Let’s take a deeper dive into these three coins and find out which one’s the best fit for your portfolio. BTFD Coin: The Meme Coin With Serious Potential If you’re even remotely plugged into the meme coin scene, you’ve probably seen this one popping up everywhere. It’s got the hype, the community, and the momentum to make a serious play in 2025. The BTFD Coin presale is absolutely crushing it, and with over $4.1 million raised, it’s clear that investors are getting in on the ground floor. Now, let’s look at what $8,000 could do for you. At today’s presale price of $0.00013, $8,000 would buy you a whopping 61,538,462 coins. That’s a lot of tokens for a relatively low price. And if the coin even hits a modest target of $0.0006 (still super conservative), your $8,000 investment could shoot up to $36,923. That’s a return of over 460%, just from holding for a few months. Of course, with the P2E game and staking rewards , the upside is even greater. So yeah, if you’re wondering which of the best meme coins to buy now, BTFD Coin is certainly one to watch. Notcoin: Earn Rewards, No Staking Required Next up, we’ve got Notcoin, the meme coin that’s shaking things up in the TON ecosystem. If you’re into Telegram and its growing influence on Web3, then Notcoin might be your next big move. They’ve recently launched their Earn programme, a game-changing initiative that lets users earn rewards just by holding TON-based tokens in their Telegram wallet—no complex staking required. This new twist makes it super easy to earn passive rewards without all the hoops and hurdles usually associated with staking. The Earn program essentially works like a launchpool, rewarding holders of Notcoin and other TON-based tokens by giving them access to airdrops. Think of it like a rewards buffet, where all you have to do is be active and hold the right tokens. Users can earn rewards hourly and even participate in exclusive pools like the Gold, Platinum, and Early Notcoin Staker groups for extra bonuses. For meme coin enthusiasts looking for a way to earn while they sleep, Notcoin’s Earn programme is a no-brainer. Book of Meme: A Surge of Hope for 2025 Now let’s talk about Book of Meme, which has been turning heads lately. This coin has all the potential to skyrocket, with predictions pointing to a $0.04 surge in 2025. Yep, you read that right. If Book of Meme can hit that target, early investors are looking at some serious returns. For reference, it’s trading at $0.008 now, so, yes, that’s a major upside we’re talking about! But what makes Book of Meme stand out? It’s not just about the meme—it’s about the community and the culture behind it. With its solid growth and the influence of meme culture, Book of Meme is one of those coins that could go from zero to hero in a matter of months. Wrap It Up: Which Meme Coin Is Right for You? So, what’s the verdict? When it comes to the best meme coins to buy now, there’s a lot to consider, but the combination of community, utility, and growth potential is key. If you’re after serious growth, BTFD Coin is the frontrunner right now. With its P2E game, staking rewards, and bullish momentum, it’s an entire ecosystem in the making. But hey, if you’re looking for something a bit more passive with rewards, Notcoin’s Earn programme could be just the ticket. And let’s not forget Book of Meme, which might just have the surprise factor for 2025. Whatever you choose, make sure to do your research, and don’t miss out on the chance to get in early on these best meme coins to buy now. Who knows? In a few months, you might just be laughing all the way to the bank. So, what are you waiting for? Sign up for BTFD Coin’s presale today.

With over 10,300 token holders and 350 million $TICS tokens sold, Qubetics is quickly proving itself as one of the best coins to invest in today. At the same time, Litecoin’s growing network strength and Fantom’s upcoming major upgrade are catching the attention of savvy investors. Qubetics is not just about hype; it brings real-world solutions where older platforms fell short. Its 13th presale stage is making waves with solid numbers, a 10% price increase every week, and the potential for massive gains. Meanwhile, Litecoin and Fantom are pushing forward with key updates that strengthen their use cases and future outlook. Qubetics Presale Draws Over 10,300 Holders with Real-Life Applications Qubetics is transforming how people and businesses interact with cryptocurrencies. Its multi-chain Qubetics Wallet combines convenience and innovation, making it easier than ever to manage digital assets across devices like iOS, Android, and desktops. Qubetics isn’t just for crypto enthusiasts—it’s built for everyday use in real-world scenarios. For example, a freelancer working with international clients can receive payments in $TICS tokens, which are automatically converted to stablecoins like USDT or USDC during transactions. This ensures stability for both parties, even as markets shift. Small businesses can also streamline cross-border payments without relying on outdated banking systems. Another standout feature is Qubetics’ virtual and physical debit card integration with Visa and Mastercard. Whether it’s paying for groceries, buying digital subscriptions, or making big-ticket purchases, users can connect Qubetics Wallet to Apple Pay or Google Pay, bridging the gap between traditional payments and crypto. For investors looking for diversification, the Qubetics Marketplace offers access to tokenized assets. Imagine owning a share of a luxury apartment in London or a piece of fine art, all made possible through $TICS tokens. This simplified process opens doors for average investors to tap into high-value markets. The 13th presale stage highlights Qubetics’ rising appeal. With over 10,300 holders and 350 million $TICS tokens sold, the project has already raised $6.9 million. At the current price of $0.0342, analysts predict that $TICS could reach $0.25 by the top crypto presale’s end , delivering a 630.19% ROI. If prices hit $1 post-presale, an investment of $140,000 today could turn into $3,949,092, showcasing immense growth potential. If you want to know more about this project, take a look at this video here . Litecoin Strengthens Its Network and Hash Rate Litecoin (LTC) has been making strong moves lately. In the past month, its price surged by over 50%, bringing renewed investor confidence and pushing the number of wallets in profit to a two-year high. This upward momentum reflects growing trust in Litecoin as a reliable alternative to Bitcoin. Litecoin’s network security is also at its strongest point ever. The hash rate—a key measure of computational power protecting the network—recently hit an all-time high of 1.74 PH/s. This 50% increase shows rising participation from miners, solidifying Litecoin’s resilience and long-term sustainability. However, analysts caution traders to watch for technical patterns, like the “inverse cup and handle,” which could signal short-term pullbacks. Despite this, Litecoin’s fundamentals remain strong, with its growing adoption and robust network positioning it as a staple in the crypto market. Fantom Set to Rebrand with Sonic Upgrade and Faster Speeds Fantom (FTM) is gearing up for a game-changing upgrade with its transition to the Sonic mainnet. This upgrade aims to boost transaction speeds, reduce fees, and improve overall scalability, making Fantom a go-to platform for decentralised applications (dApps) and DeFi projects. Ahead of this upgrade, Fantom saw a 16% price surge, indicating strong market excitement. Analysts note that technical indicators, like the MACD bullish crossover, suggest further gains may be on the horizon. The Sonic upgrade is particularly significant because it enhances Fantom’s ability to handle more transactions at lower costs—key factors for attracting developers and new projects. For users, this upgrade means faster, cheaper transactions, positioning Fantom as one of the most efficient platforms in the DeFi space. By addressing previous scalability concerns, Fantom is set to compete with leading Layer-1 solutions. Conclusion Qubetics, Litecoin, and Fantom are showing impressive developments that make them stand out as some of the best coins to invest in today. Qubetics’ presale success, with over 10,300 holders and 350 million $TICS tokens sold , offers investors a unique opportunity with real-world solutions and massive growth potential. Litecoin’s strengthened network security and rising hash rate highlight its reliability, while Fantom’s Sonic upgrade promises faster transactions and lower fees. Each of these projects is building momentum for the future, making them strong contenders for anyone seeking long-term gains.

Hedera’s Integration with Chainlink Enhances DeFi Capabilities Hedera is enhancing its decentralized finance (DeFi) ecosystem by integrating Chainlink’s Data Feeds and Proof of Reserve on its mainnet. This collaboration aims to provide secure, real-time data essential for DeFi applications, enabling more robust and transparent financial products. The integration is expected to position Hedera as a competitive Layer One (L1) chain in the DeFi space. Additionally, the HBAR Foundation has joined Chainlink SCALE to strengthen developer access to oracle services, further supporting the growth of Hedera’s ecosystem. Cronos’ Pallene Upgrade Boosts Network Performance Cronos has completed the Cronos EVM v1.4.0 Pallene upgrade, significantly enhancing the network’s transaction processing capabilities. This upgrade introduces features that increase transaction execution speed by up to 600 times, positioning Cronos to support emerging AI agents and complex decentralized applications more efficiently. This development underscores Cronos’ commitment to improving scalability and performance, making it a more attractive platform for developers and users seeking high-speed blockchain solutions. Conclusion Qubetics, Hedera, and Cronos are shaking up the blockchain world in their own ways.

Trump Patriot (TRUMPPAT), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 19,000% in price in the coming days. This is because TRUMPPAT is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Trump Patriot can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Trump Patriot could become the next viral memecoin. Trump Patriot launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Trump Patriot on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Trump Patriot by entering its contract address – 9hmvtogFEjzZQMFfJ5Hiq7fQSq7E38mG3Qjb7X42qM6P – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like TRUMPPAT. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Press Releases,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|DOGE|EXCHANGE|SHIB|SOL,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2024-12-18 02:43:00

USDtb Debuts According to the official blog post , the stablecoin’s primary reserve asset, BUIDL, makes up 90% of USDtb’s overall backing, positioning it as the highest BUIDL-backed stablecoin to date. USDtb is independent of Ethena’s USDe, thereby providing users with an alternative stablecoin offering a distinct risk profile. Additionally, USDtb is expected to improve USDe’s resilience in volatile market conditions by potentially serving as a backup asset during periods of negative funding rates. The product has passed extensive audits from leading security firms such as Code4rena, Quantstamp, Cyfrin, and Pashov. It is being considered for inclusion in Spark’s $1 billion Tokenization Grand Prix. Ethena has tapped Copper, Zodia Custody, Komainu, and Coinbase Institutional to serve as custodians for its newly launched USDtb stablecoin. The token’s liquidity will be supported by major providers, including Jump, Cumberland, Amber Group, GSR Markets, and SCB Limited. USDtb’s Impact on Ethena’s Stablecoin Ecosystem José Maria Macedo, co-founder of blockchain research and development firm Delphi Labs, predicts that USDtb will become the largest on-chain tokenized treasury product within a month of its launch. Highlighting the significance for Ethena, Macedo noted that USDtb not only provides a “lower-risk” yield-bearing stablecoin option but also strengthens Ethena’s existing USDe stablecoin. The exec even went on to say that during periods when funding rates fall below treasury rates, Ethena can close out hedging positions and reallocate assets to USDtb. This approach reduces USDe’s exposure to negative funding rate concerns while ensuring that its floor yield matches the treasury rate. Meanwhile, Seraphim Czecker, Ethena’s head of growth, spoke about the impact of USDtb on Ethena’s operations, particularly in bearish market conditions. He explained that prolonged periods of negative funding rates no longer pose a threat to Ethena, as the platform can now allocate capital to its own real-world asset-backed stablecoin, USDtb. This effectively establishes a yield “floor” tied to the T-Bill rate, ensuring a stable APY even in unfavorable market environments. Czecker further highlighted USDtb’s scalability, noting its potential to exceed $100 billion in total value locked (TVL).

Solana Realized Cap Growth Has Slowed Down Recently In a new post on X, Glassnode has discussed about how the recent performance of Solana has stacked up against the two largest coins in the sector. “Looking at price performance, SOL outpaced both ETH and BTC for most of Q4 2024,” notes the analytics firm. “However, since early December, ETH has taken the lead, outperforming the other two assets.” As it stands right now, Bitcoin is up around 18% over the past month, Ethereum 28%, and Solana 3%. Thus, SOL has clearly fallen off after being the market leader just earlier. Related Reading: Bitcoin Top Here? What Historical HODLer Selloff Pattern Says What could be behind this shift in the market? The answer to the question could lie in the capital flows that these cryptocurrencies have recently been observing. In order to estimate the capital flows for the assets, Glassnode has made use of the Realized Cap indicator. The “Realized Cap” refers to an on-chain capitalization model that calculates the total value of any digital asset by assuming that the ‘real’ value of any token in circulation is the price at which it was last transacted on the blockchain. Since the last transfer for any coin is likely to represent the last point at which it changed hands, the price at its time could be considered its cost basis. Thus, the Realized Cap is a sum of the cost basis of all coins in the circulating supply or, more simply, a measure of the total amount of capital that the investors as a whole have put into the cryptocurrency. In this view, changes in the Realized Cap essentially reflect the amount of capital that’s exiting out of or entering into the asset. Below is the chart for the 7-day change in the indicator shared by the analytics firm, which showcases these outflows/inflows happening for Solana and others. From the chart, it’s visible that the 7-day change in the Realized Cap was at notable positive levels between September and early December. Bitcoin and Ethereum also observed capital inflows in this period, but SOL was simply growing at a significantly faster pace. Related Reading: Bitcoin Miners Now In Selling Mode For A Year: Should You Be Concerned? This month, though, the sector has seen a flip as both Bitcoin and Ethereum have pulled ahead of Solana. The earlier higher capital inflows were likely the drivers behind SOL’s outperformance, so with them gone, it makes sense that the top two assets would take over. SOL Price Whereas Bitcoin and Ethereum have enjoyed a surge over the last few days, Solana has been moving in a sideways trajectory as its price is still trading around $221.

It’s not just about a token; it’s about risk, reputation, and trust in the crypto ecosystem. Sun affiliated BiT Global filed a lawsuit against Coinbase and they have submitted a response to it. BiT Global isn’t happy with the delisting. They’ve accused Coinbase of damaging their reputation and profits. Meanwhile, the exchange has made it clear: their priority is user safety, not BiT’s business interests. What’s About wBTC Delisting? Coinbase decided to drop wBTC from its listings after discovering BiT Global now controls the token. What is the problem with that? Well, BiT Global is tied to Justin Sun and he has faced allegations of fraud, market manipulation, and is even under investigation by the FBI. Paul Grewal, Coinbase’s Chief Legal Officer, addressed the situation directly in a tweet. He called BiT’s claims “baseless” and reaffirmed the commitment of the exchange to protect its platform and users. Source : X.com For Coinbase, this connection was a red flag. They use strict reviews to make sure all listed assets meet their safety and integrity standards. To them, wBTC no longer made the cut. But BiT Global claims this move hurts them and wBTC users worldwide. They’ve gone to court to stop the delisting, asking for a Temporary Restraining Order (TRO). Coinbase’s Defense: Facts Over Fears Coinbase’s legal team isn’t holding back. In their response , they pointed out that BiT delayed filing the TRO until days before wBTC’s delisting. If it was so urgent, why wait? They also argued that the delisting wouldn’t make much of a dent. Less than 1% of global wBTC trading happens on Coinbase. So even if they delist it, the impact on the market is tiny. And the bigger issue? Reputation. According to Coinbase, any damage to wBTC’s trust didn’t start with their decision. It started with Justin Sun’s history. Legally, Coinbase stood firm. They said platforms have the right to decide what assets they list. No one can force them to list something they believe puts users at risk. What Comes Next? The case is heading to court on December 18, 2024. Coinbase seems confident in their stance, and they’re sticking to their decision. For BiT Global, this is a tough fight—they’ll need to prove their claims hold water. The outcome could change how crypto platforms handle delistings in the future. But for now, Coinbase has one focus: protecting their platform and the people who use it. This isn’t just another crypto dispute. It’s about setting standards for safety and trust in an unpredictable industry.",News|Exchange News,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|EXCHANGE|MARKET|REGULATION,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2024-12-18 03:20:37

However, XRP has hit reverse after touching $2.71 and is now trading at $2.55 level. XRP has strong support near the $2.40 levels and currently, the market is moving in the right direction and may rise slightly higher. A micro support region has been established between $2.55 and $2.62, though there is no immediate expectation for this level to be tested. The third wave is still unfolding, with a 100% extension reached. The ideal target for this third wave is around $2.81, but support should ideally remain above the current levels. Anything below this would be considered a deeper pullback, but still within the range of micro structures. The third wave is expected to extend higher, followed by waves 4 and 5, which could push XRP to retest its all-time high. However, the structure is currently fragile, and while the price movement is not as impulsive as previous rallies, support levels are holding firm. Breakout to $3.80 on Cards? According to analyst Josh of Crypto World, XRP has solid support around $2, where previous resistance is now acting as support. There haven’t been significant changes for XRP recently, but in the short term, the price is continuing its bullish breakout from a bull flag pattern.

Combining blockchain technology with artificial intelligence, Lightchain AI aims to revolutionize how speed, scalability, and real-world utility coexist. And now, with the Lightchain AI Presale underway, it’s the perfect time to explore why this platform is a game-changer. While Solana (SOL) has gained recognition for its lightning-fast transaction speeds and low fees, Lightchain AI is taking a different path. Instead of simply chasing throughput, it integrates AI-driven features to enhance scalability, security, and usability. Solana may dominate the race for speed, but Lightchain AI is redefining what it means to cross the finish line in the blockchain space. The Allure of Solana: A Blockchain Built for Speed Solana’s Lightning-Fast Network Solana’s architecture, built around Proof of History (PoH), allows it to process up to 65,000 transactions per second (TPS), significantly surpassing many other blockchain platforms. With transaction fees typically under $0.01, Solana has become an appealing choice for both developers and users. Its core advantages include efficient scalability, enabling support for a wide range of applications from DeFi to gaming, a developer-friendly ecosystem that attracts innovative projects with its growing set of tools and resources, and cost-effectiveness, making it ideal for microtransactions and dApps. Challenges Under the Hood Despite its impressive performance, Solana faces several challenges. Its network downtime has been a recurring issue, raising concerns about reliability. Additionally, critics point to centralization concerns, arguing that its validator structure leans more centralized, potentially conflicting with the decentralized principles of blockchain. Moreover, while Solana excels in speed, it lacks the advanced functionalities required for AI-driven or industry-specific applications, which limits its broader use case potential. Lightchain AI: Transforming Speed into Smart Efficiency A New Breed of Blockchain While Solana focuses on transaction volume, Lightchain AI’s AI-enhanced blockchain takes a more holistic approach. The platform introduces cutting-edge innovations like Proof of Intelligence (PoI) and the Artificial Intelligence Virtual Machine (AIVM) to not only deliver speed but also integrate real-world intelligence into its core operations. Why Lightchain AI Stands Out: Intelligent Consensus: PoI rewards nodes for meaningful computations, transforming validation processes into productive AI tasks. Adaptability: AIVM’s architecture dynamically scales resources based on workload demand, ensuring consistent performance. Broad Applicability: From healthcare to predictive analytics, Lightchain AI caters to a diverse range of industries. A Tale of Two Titans: Solana vs. Lightchain AI Transaction Throughput vs. AI Integration While Solana dominates transaction speeds, Lightchain AI introduces capabilities that Solana’s architecture cannot match: PoH vs. PoI: Solana’s Proof of History timestamps transactions for speed, while Lightchain AI’s Proof of Intelligence utilizes AI-driven computations for validation, merging utility with consensus. Static vs. Dynamic Processing: Solana excels in high-speed transactions but lacks the adaptability of Lightchain AI’s resource allocation. Scalability Without Compromise Solana’s scalability is often hampered during network congestion, a challenge Lightchain AI addresses through: Parallel Processing: Tasks are distributed across multiple nodes to maintain high throughput. Dynamic Resource Allocation: Lightchain AI optimizes computational power based on real-time demand, avoiding bottlenecks. Lightchain AI in Action: Real-World Applications 1. AI-Powered DeFi Innovation Lightchain AI enhances decentralized finance ( DeFi ) with predictive models that: Optimize Risk Assessment: Real-time analytics improve lending and trading protocols. Enable Smarter Investments: AI tools offer insights for yield farming and portfolio management. 2. Intelligent NFTs Lightchain AI is pushing the boundaries of non-fungible tokens ( NFTs ) by: Creating Adaptive Assets: NFTs evolve based on user behavior or real-world events. Integrating AI Features: Supports interactive collectibles for gaming and art. 3. Healthcare and Logistics From diagnosing diseases to improving supply chains, Lightchain AI’s AIVM is a game-changer: Medical Insights: AI enhances imaging analysis and predictive healthcare models. Transparent Supply Chains: Improves efficiency and accountability through data-driven tracking. The Future of Blockchain: Lightchain AI’s Vision Lightchain AI goes beyond traditional metrics of blockchain success by introducing AI-enhanced capabilities that redefine what’s possible. Its ability to combine speed, precision, and adaptability makes it a trailblazer in the blockchain revolution. What Sets Lightchain AI Apart: Real-World Impact: Industry-specific applications that solve tangible problems. Sustainability: Energy-efficient mechanisms reduce the environmental footprint. AI-Powered Solutions: Tools and features that extend beyond financial applications.

Coinbase’s chief legal officer Paul Grewal confirmed this in an X post : We’ve filed our response to BiT Global’s effort to stop our delisting of wBTC before any discovery or even formal response to their bogus claims. We explain why this lawsuit lacks merit and why their request for a TRO should be denied. ~ Paul Grewal The legal debacle occurred during transition maintenance for wBTC from BitGo to BiT Global and its Singaporean satellite. In August, BitGo stated that, in a bid to enhance the resilience of its protocol, it was sharing two of the three wBTC keys with those two firms. Coinbase acted on the concerns of crypto players BiT Global argued in its submission that Coinbase is simply promoting a rival tokenized Bitcoin product, cbBTC. They claimed Coinbase has resorted to defamatory remarks to instil fear and doubt about wBTC’s regulatory position and stability. However, Coinbase has maintained that their reaction comes from the concerns of the users. Mr. Sun has had regulatory issues and has been accused of market manipulation. This has contributed to Coinbase taking relevant measures. Under the arrangement between BitGo and BiT Global’s two entities, BitGo will be in charge of operations, as the two BiT Global firms hold collaterals for wBTC. BiT Global accuses Coinbase of violating federal laws over wBTC delisting Coinbase has stated that BiT Global wants to force it into business with an entity that is non-compliant with its standards due to Mr Sun’s material involvement. Yet, they need more audacity to mention Sun’s connection to the complaint and TRO request. BiT Global holds that Coinbase has breached several federal and state laws in its attempt to delist wBTC. Among the breached laws are the Sherman Act and the Lanham Act, which prohibits unfair monopolies.

The overall market cap declined by approximately 1% to $3.71 trillion, while trading volumes fell by 8.6% to $185 billion. The Fear and Greed Index signaled extreme greed, reading 80. So, let’s take a closer look at some of the leading cryptocurrencies by market cap and their price action on December 18. Crypto Prices Today: Market Tackles Turbulence But Some Alts Soar The crypto market showed a mixed reaction, with Bitcoin and Ethereum down by 1% to 3%. However, U.S.-based projects like XRP, Stellar (XLM), and Hedera (HBAR) surged by 3% to 6% over the last 24 hours, reflecting positive momentum among select altcoins despite the broader market dip. Bitcoin Price Today The Bitcoin (BTC) price dropped by 1% and was trading at $105,368. Its 24-hour low and high were $105,004 and $108,269, respectively.

Other notable meme coins like PEPE, BONK, and WIF have dropped by 2% to 6%. These movements reflect the trend in crypto prices today, as the meme coin market faces a correction amid broader market fluctuations. Top Crypto Gainer Prices Today Pudgy Penguins Pudgy Penguins (PENGU) became the top gainer for today, surging by 550% in the last 24 hours. The price skyrocketed after Binance launched it yesterday . Currently, PENGU is trading at $0.03, with a 24-hour low of $0.02 and a high of $0.06. Bitget Token Bitget Token (BGB) continues its strong performance, marking the second consecutive day as a top gainer. Today, it’s up by 17%, currently trading at $4.18. Its 24-hour low and high range between $3.56 and $4.23. The rise in price is attributed to Bitget, the leading cryptocurrency exchange, being granted a license to operate as a Bitcoin service provider by El Salvador’s Central Bank . Litecoin Litecoin (LTC) was up by approximately 7% in the last 24 hours and is currently trading at $125. Its 24-hour low and high were $114 and $129. The rise in price is mainly attributed to predictions from Bloomberg analysts that a Litecoin ETF could launch sooner than those for Solana and XRP. As seen in crypto prices today, Litecoin’s growth is notable amid broader market trends. Top Crypto Loser Prices Today Lido DAO Lido DAO (LDO) price was down by 9% and is currently trading at $2.08. Its 24-hour low and high were $2.05 and $2.31, making it the worst performer for today. In crypto prices today, Lido DAO’s decline stands out amidst other market movements.

Crypto prices today reflect a slight dip for Fantom. Besides, the hourly chart shows a bearish trend, with Bitcoin down by half a percent, and major altcoins like XRP, Solana (SOL), and Binance Coin (BNB) down by approximately 1% in the last hour. This indicates short-term selling pressure across the market.

Derek Merrin, the Leader of the Ohio House Republicans, introduced the bill. Derek Merrin, who was the former Mayor of Waterville, took to X to announce that House Bill 703, filed this week, would enable the state treasurer to invest in Bitcoin ( BTC ) in order to create an “Ohio Bitcoin Reserve” in the state treasury. His thought behind introducing the bill was that incorporating BTC into the state’s investment portfolio could help hedge against the slow erosion of the purchasing power of the U.S. dollar, thereby helping to retain the value of public funds across generations.

Advocates like Cynthia Lummis argue that with BTC gaining acceptance as a form of payment by large businesses and even government agencies in some instances, including it in state reserves would enhance a state’s financial strength. Further, this could push forward more corporate adoption for digital assets, legitimizing its position in global finance, according to Matthew Sigel, who heads the Digital Assets Research wing of VanEck .

Most of Ohio’s debt consists of general obligation bonds and special obligation bonds issued to fund infrastructure projects, education, and other public projects. As a result, if Ohio can now add BTC to its treasury reserves, the state would likely improve its long-term financial solvency. In time, such a strategy could brighten Ohio’s fiscal picture, easing the pressure to raise taxes or cut services and putting the state in a much better position to fulfill such obligations.

A nonprofit focused on government accountability, they questioned Hinman, who served as the SEC’s Division of Corporation Finance director from 2017 to 2020. The group found documents suggesting Hinman may have violated ethics rules about conflicts of interest and sent evidence to the SEC’s Office of Inspector General in May 2022. In February 2024, the SEC’s inspector general said the investigation was almost finished. The report could support their investigation before Clayton is confirmed as U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of New York. What Did Hinman Say in His Controversial 2018 Speech? In 2018, Hinman gave a high-profile speech stating that Ethereum’s digital token, Ether, was not a security, which led to an immediate rise in Ether’s price. This raised questions about whether Hinman violated the law by promoting Ether while having financial conflicts of interest. “Based on my understanding of the present state of Ether, the Ethereum network and its decentralized structure, current offers and sales of Ether are not securities transactions,” he had said. Outside groups, including Consumer Action for a Strong Economy (CASE), have continued to push the SEC to release the report. Pro-XRP lawyer John Deaton wrote, “TIME TO RELEASE THE REPORT @GaryGensler If we are going to move forward – we do so with complete TRANSPARENCY. If Gensler doesn’t release this report, Paul Atkins needs to do so immediately. @HesterPeirceand others should be calling for its release.” XRP vs SEC: The issue also revolves around a lawsuit filed on December 22, 2020, during the final days of the Trump administration. SEC Chairman Jay Clayton and William Hinman, Director of the SEC’s Division of Corporation Finance, sued Ripple Labs, its co-founder Chris Larsen, former CEO and executive chairman, and current CEO Brad Garlinghouse. The lawsuit accused them of selling $1.3 billion worth of XRP cryptocurrency as unregistered securities. Tristan Leavitt, in his 22-page letter, wrote how SEC commissioner Joseph Grundfest felt SEC’s actions against XRP were problematic. Grundfest wrote to the SEC and said, “The staff has articulated no material distinction between the operation of Ether and of XRP that is relevant to the application of the federal securities laws. Imposing securities law obligations on XRP while leaving Ether untouched raises fundamental fairness questions about the exercise of Commission discretion Ether and XRP should be treated similarly.",News|Crypto news|Ripple (XRP),EN,0,0,ETH|REGULATION|TRADING|XRP,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2024-12-18 04:02:28

Santa Rides Shiba (SANTSHIB), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 19,000% in price in the coming days. This is because SANTSHIB is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Santa Rides Shiba can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Santa Rides Shiba could become the next viral memecoin. Santa Rides Shiba launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Santa Rides Shiba on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Santa Rides Shiba by entering its contract address – CxpeR8vdgeVWZFwBytS7PRrXHBwVgPJWZBJUcpK3k7vT – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like SANTSHIB. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Press Releases,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|DOGE|EXCHANGE|SHIB|SOL,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2024-12-18 04:05:00

Over the past week, Bitcoin’s trading volume and market cap have shown consistent growth, signalling rising interest among institutional investors. According to CoinDesk’s latest report, Bitcoin’s trading volumes soared by 18% as the crypto broke through its previous resistance levels. Analysts point out that the renewed focus on Bitcoin ETFs and institutional adoption is fuelling this momentum. For example, BlackRock recently hinted at accelerating its plans for Bitcoin ETF approval, which could bring billions of fresh investments into the asset. Additionally, El Salvador’s Bitcoin strategy has seen a new surge in returns, highlighting the coin’s long-term value. On-chain data also shows that whales are accumulating Bitcoin again, suggesting bullish sentiment heading into the next halving cycle. For those keeping their eyes on stable investments, Bitcoin remains an anchor in the volatile market. Its growing adoption as digital gold and institutional backing makes it an essential part of a strong crypto portfolio. ZIGnaly Boosts Traders’ Earnings with Strategic Updates ZIGnaly is making strides in helping retail and pro traders level up their crypto earnings. This copy trading platform recently reported a 25% increase in user base after rolling out its latest AI-powered trading bots. The platform allows investors to mirror the trades of top-performing traders, which has gained massive traction among beginners looking to automate their crypto strategies. Earlier this week, ZIGnaly announced an upgrade to its profit-sharing model, reducing platform fees and increasing trader payouts by 12%. This move aims to attract more expert traders to the platform, creating win-win opportunities for both sides. Moreover, ZIGnaly’s native token saw a notable uptick after its integration with leading blockchains like Binance Smart Chain (BSC) and Ethereum. This opens doors for smoother liquidity and faster transaction speeds—critical features that ZIGnaly needed to stay competitive. For investors seeking reliable utility-driven platforms, ZIGnaly remains one of the best coins to invest in this month. Conclusion: Why These Are the Best Coins to Invest in This Month Qubetics, Bitcoin, and ZIGnaly each bring something valuable to the table for crypto investors. Bitcoin continues to deliver unmatched stability, solidifying its role as the cornerstone of every portfolio. ZIGnaly’s innovative platform upgrades make it a strong contender for traders seeking automated, profitable solutions.

With Bitcoin hitting record highs, important figures like Senator Cynthia Lummis and Dennis Porter are pushing hard to make it happen. The plan is to make Bitcoin a part of U.S. fiscal policy. This could help strengthen the U.S. dollar and even improve national security. It’s a bold idea that could completely reshape how America handles money. Cynthia Lummis and Her Vision for Bitcoin Cynthia Lummis, the Wyoming Senator, has been a Bitcoin supporter for a long time. She sees Bitcoin not just as a cryptocurrency, but as something that could help secure America’s financial future. She’s backing a proposal to turn part of the U.S. gold reserves into Bitcoin. Lummis argues this would save the government billions and give the dollar a much-needed boost. Source : X.com But she’s not in this alone. David Sacks, a venture capitalist who’s been named the “ Crypto Czar ,” is working alongside her to push for a new law that would make Bitcoin a key part of the U.S. reserves. This partnership is all about making sure the economy stays strong, even as we head into a more digital age. Dennis Porter and the Executive Order Dennis Porter, the CEO of Satoshi Action Fund, shared the first page of an Executive order via an X post. This EO could pave the way for the Strategic Bitcoin Reserve. This will allow the U.S Treasury to manage BTC as a reserve asset along with the dollar and gold. MASSIVE BREAKING: I can confirm that my team has finalized a model EXECUTIVE ORDER for the president of the United States to establish a ‘Strategic Bitcoin Reserve’ pic.twitter.com/rz3issLf2H — Dennis Porter (@Dennis_Porter_) December 17, 2024 The executive order also proposes taking around 200,000 Bitcoin—seized in criminal cases and worth about $20 billion—and using them as part of this reserve. Instead of selling these assets at auction, they would be put to work for national financial stability. To ensure transparency, the Treasury would oversee Bitcoin with robust security and conduct regular audits. What’s Next for Bitcoin in U.S. Reserves? If the plan goes ahead, the Strategic Bitcoin Reserve could have a major impact on the U.S. economy. It might help cut down the national debt, protect the country from inflation. It can even make the dollar more competitive on the global stage. Beyond that, it could give the U.S. a stronger negotiating position against economic powers like China and Russia. While the proposal sounds promising, it’s clear that challenges remain.

According to data shared by CryptoQuant analyst Avocado Onchain, spot market demand has emerged as a significant driving force behind Bitcoin’s ongoing price increases. This trend indicates growing buying pressure from long-term investors, as speculative activity in the futures market appears to be cooling. Related Reading: Bitcoin’s Next Big Move? Key Metric Reveals When to Cash In Profits Bitcoin Spot Market Demand Gains Strength The analyst’s observations provide insights into Bitcoin’s ongoing bull cycle, which began in the first half of 2023. According to Avocado, initially, the futures market led the charge in pushing Bitcoin’s price upward, signalling a speculative phase fuelled by short-term traders. However, this momentum was interrupted earlier this year when both the futures and spot markets experienced reduced trading activity starting in March. Since October, market activity has returned, with trading volumes rising across both futures and spot markets, providing fresh support for Bitcoin’s rally. In his analysis, Avocado Onchain noted a key trend: while futures market activity has recently declined, demand in the spot market has been steadily increasing. Spot market activity refers to the actual purchase of Bitcoin on exchanges for immediate delivery, typically driven by investors with a long-term perspective. This stands in contrast to futures markets, where traders speculate on price movements using contracts that do not require immediate ownership of the asset. Spot Market Demand Takes the Lead as Bitcoin Continues Its Upward Momentum “While futures market activity has declined, spot market demand continues to increase.

Historically, overheated futures markets have led to volatility, often triggering liquidations. However, the cooling of futures market activity, coupled with rising spot market demand, reflects a more sustainable form of buying pressure that can underpin Bitcoin’s long-term growth. The CryptoQuant analyst noted: Looking ahead, the futures market is likely to undergo cycles of overheating and liquidations, which will contribute to Bitcoin’s price growth. This price movement will, in turn, encourage further capital inflows into the spot market. Additionally, Avocado Onchain pointed to the 30-day exponential moving average (EMA) of Bitcoin’s funding rate, which shows “no signs of late-cycle overheating.” Related Reading: Bitcoin To Hit $180,000 If These Cycle Top Indicators Are Absent, Says VanEck’s Sigel The funding rate measures the cost of holding futures contracts and is often used as an indicator of market sentiment. Avocado mentioned that as BTC funding rate remains balanced, it suggests that BTC’s price movements are not being driven solely by leveraged positions, reducing the risk of sudden price reversals.

According to Fox Business’ Eleanor Terrett, a Senate aide confirmed that the Senate Banking Committee’s scheduled vote on her nomination has been canceled. Crenshaw, who was known for her anti-crypto stance, even opposed the approval of the Bitcoin spot ETF, issuing a dissent. This victory is seen as a step forward for the crypto community, with many expecting a pro-crypto shift in the SEC under new leadership. Crypto advocates flooded the Senate with 107,000 emails opposing Crenshaw’s renomination, showing the strength of the industry’s voice. Additionally, Senator Cynthia Lummis predicts that 2025 will be a major year for Bitcoin and digital assets, with David Sacks serving as the crypto czar. Crenshaw, appointed to the SEC in 2020 under the Trump administration and later renominated by President Biden, has been a strong ally of SEC Chair Gary Gensler. She is considered even more anti-crypto than Gensler, especially due to her opposition to key crypto policies. With Crenshaw not being renominated as SEC Chair, it significantly boosts the likelihood that the SEC will not continue its pursuit of Ripple Labs. This also opens the door for President Trump to appoint someone new, potentially more favorable to the crypto space. Why Didn’t The Crypto Market React? When an X user remarked that one would have expected this news to affect the market, attorney Fred Rispoli responded, saying, “These kinds of moves are fairly esoteric, and only the most dialed-in crypto folks are following it.

While the crypto industry is no stranger to adversity, this year has seen a surge of optimism regarding its potential. With the re-election of Donald Trump as President of the United States, the global cryptocurrency market has surpassed a valuation of $3 trillion for the first time in over three years. This resurgence is driven by a demand for Bitcoin and other digital assets, coinciding with the new administration’s policies and market sentiment. With the clouds starting to part, regulatory clarity and infrastructural progress have emerged as two key factors driving the industry’s successes and hard-earned legitimacy. This shift has fueled a steady influx of VC (venture capital) investments over the course of 2024, signaling the market is both maturing and preparing for a major breakout. So, how can startups take advantage of 2025’s fresh possibilities to garner VC attention? The answer lies in reflecting on the past year. Gains of 2024 This year welcomed a new level of maturity for the crypto sector, with some of the most successful projects prioritizing security, compliance and building trust with investors and the broader Web 3.0 community. Just two weeks into the year, the approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs supercharged market confidence, attracting institutional and retail investors. But why? The move legitimized Bitcoin in the eyes of skeptics, fueling interest in crypto to the general public and driving gradual price gains. By making Bitcoin more accessible through traditional financial markets, the approval opened the gates for larger institutional investments , which had previously been cautious about direct exposure to the crypto market. And now, Trump’s re-election has produced a market surge, with Bitcoin prices reaching a historic high, surging over 129% in 2024. While the specifics of Trump’s crypto policy remain uncertain, he is widely anticipated to be a strong ally to the industry, fueling optimism for what lies ahead. One of the most welcomed developments over the last 12 months has been the convergence between crypto and AI . While it was always clear that these two transformative technologies would eventually intersect, few could have predicted the speed and scale at which they merged – a nd the surface of what’s possible is only just being scratched. While there is no crystal ball to predict exactly what’s coming next year, startups can use 2024 as a compass, pinpointing which trends will be on VCs radar. Solving scalability through infrastructure For startups looking to scale successfully, one of the most critical areas to address is the infrastructure sector, particularly in the ongoing development and scaling of Ethereum’s ecosystem. As Ethereum continues to grow rapidly, scalability remains a major barrier, making it a key focus for VCs looking to invest in solutions that can handle high-volume transactions efficiently. Layer-two solutions are becoming increasingly essential in addressing the challenges facing Ethereum , and VCs are keen to support startups in developing the infrastructure needed to enhance the network’s efficiency, security and accessibility. Pioneering privacy solutions with AI and blockchain In 2025, AI and blockchain are set to significantly advance data privacy, addressing concerns highlighted by copyright lawsuits involving several high-profile companies . Innovations such as FHE (fully homomorphic encryption) and federated learning are set to pave the way for privacy-preserving AI training. Startups combining AI and blockchain to safeguard privacy while creating value for users are positioned to attract investor attention. In particular, solutions that allow individuals to maintain control over their data and be compensated for its use could disrupt traditional data-sharing models, creating new business opportunities. Beyond privacy, there are clear challenges in AI that Web 3.0 could help address, including improving accessibility and democratization, creating pathways for monetization and ownership and fostering incentives for open contributions. While the future remains uncertain, the growth of consumer adoption and institutional investment is likely to strengthen the foundations of the crypto industry and drive sustainable progress. In the coming year, we expect VCs to deepen their commitments, focusing on building long-term value while supporting talented founders whose solutions will drive the next wave of innovation. The rise of PayFi While DeFi has made steady progress, its full integration into traditional financial systems is still unfolding. Interest in DeFi is on the rise, and in 2025, the focus will shift towards PayFi (payment finance). First introduced last July, PayFi leverages blockchain as a settlement layer, using Web 3.0 payments and DeFi protocols to create more transparent, cost-effective and efficient financial transactions. For VCs, investing in PayFi startups presents an opportunity to be involved in the next wave of financial innovation, which is set to reshape the relationship between crypto and TradFi (traditional finance). Increasing focus on real-world assets for investment opportunities Tokenized RWAs (real-world assets) are quickly becoming a popular investment. By 2030, the market for tokenized RWAs is projected to reach $16 trillion , as companies are looking to bring more traditional asset classes onto blockchain platforms. ANZ, one of Australia’s top four banks, recently partnered with Singapore’s Project Guardian to explore tokenizing RWAs, which is an example of an institution looking to expand access to a wider range of asset classes. VCs should look out for projects innovating in this space, as tokenized RWAs allow even those with limited capital to participate in substantial ventures, opening opportunities for financial growth and stability, Bringing stablecoins and TradFi together As blockchain continues to align with TradFi, the stablecoin market will be a pivotal sector to watch. VCs should be keenly interested in the growing stablecoin market, particularly as major players recently announced new initiatives that will allow banks to issue stablecoins and other fiat-backed tokens internationally. Stablecoins, alongside payments and yield protocols, are expected to play a central role in the continued Web 3.0 expansion by providing stable, scalable and interoperable solutions for DeFi applications. They help to ensure seamless value transfer, which has the potential to help foster greater adoption across markets globally. As new projects enter the DeFi playing field, VCs will continue to intensify their investments, prioritizing the creation of long-term value and continue backing founders whose solutions are set to fuel and lead the next wave of progress in the blockchain and Web 3.0 ecosystem.

This day has also been designated as the initial distribution record date for those holding allowed claims in the plan’s convenience classes. Distribution Details According to a press release , payments for these claims are expected to begin within 60 days of the plan’s effective date. In line with this, recipients must complete know-your-customer (KYC) procedures and fulfill other distribution requirements, including submitting tax forms. This first round of payments will only apply to the convenience classes, with FTX noting that separate records and payment dates for other classes of claims will be announced later. The court-approved reorganization plan, finalized in October 2024, received overwhelming support from creditors, who stand to recover an average of 119% of the value of their claims. Furthermore, under the terms of the initiative, some will receive up to 140% in cash. FTX estimates that total recoveries will range between $14.7 billion and $16.5 billion. These repayments have been made possible through efforts to reclaim assets from various parties, including the U.S. Department of Justice and international regulators. The company’s CEO, John J. Ray III, highlighted that the latest development demonstrated the significant success of the recovery efforts. “For the past two years, our team of professionals have meticulously and efficiently worked to recover billions of dollars to reach this point.” He added that FTX is now in a strong position to begin reimbursing funds to customers and creditors. He also encouraged claim holders to ensure they complete all the necessary steps to avoid delays in receiving their payments. Distribution Agents and FTX Convictions To support the distribution process, the defunct exchange has partnered with two crypto custodians, BitGo and Kraken. The duo will help disburse the funds to both retail and institutional customers as well as other claimants in supported jurisdictions. FTX’s bankruptcy filing in late 2022 was one of the most significant collapses in the crypto industry. It was marked by several high-profile sentences, including the November 2023 conviction of former CEO Sam Bankman-Fried on charges of wire fraud and conspiracy, resulting in a 25-year imprisonment. In May 2024, FTX Digital Markets co-CEO Ryan Salame was sentenced to 7.5 years in prison, while Caroline Ellison, the former head of Alameda Research, received a two-year prison term. Two other executives, Nishad Singh and Gary Wang, avoided prison altogether.

According to a Bloomberg report the bank launched its test version of Project Dama 2, an asset servicing pilot, in November. This platform’s layer two system relies on public blockchains to provide a more affordable and efficient transaction. Boon-Hiong Chan, a Deutsche Bank Asia-Pacific innovation lead, said that the bank’s Layer 2 connects to Ethereum, one of the blockchain’s busiest networks. Deutsche Bank sees blockchain as a means to deal with margin pressures in financial services Chan explained that public blockchains such as Ethereum pose risks to regulated banks. The risks include uncertainty regarding who is performing the validation of transactions, the possibility of paying fees to sanctioned entities, and the possibility of unexpected changes to the blockchain. Chan added “Using two chains, a number of these regulatory concerns should be able to be satisfied.” Project Dama 2 is one of several initiatives in Singapore’s Project Guardian, where 24 major financial institutions are looking to tokenize assets via blockchain. Deutsche Bank, among other advocates, sees blockchain as a means to deal with margin pressures in financial services. But there are still questions as to how far banks should go in the crypto world.

Over the years, their popularity has skyrocketed, driven by community engagement, viral marketing, and a sprinkle of good old-fashioned internet humour. Today, we’re diving into three standout contenders in this space: BTFD Coin , Book of Meme, and Snek. These projects are not just riding the meme coin wave; they’re innovating gameplay, turning pages, and sneaking up in value. Each of these coins showcases exceptional potential for returns, making them some of the best meme coins to invest in December 2024. BTFD Coin is particularly noteworthy due to its innovative play-to-earn (P2E) gaming mechanics and staking rewards. This coin isn’t merely about memes; it’s about building a robust community and giving back to its holders. With a presale that launched on November 26, 2024, BTFD Coin is setting the stage for something big. Analysts are buzzing with excitement, predicting a significant increase in value as the presale progresses. With each stage, the anticipation grows, and potential investors are keen to jump on board before it’s too late. As for the presale itself, BTFD Coin has already raised over $4.1 million, hitting the $1 million mark in under ten days and $2.5 million in just fourteen days. This kind of traction is hard to ignore, especially when you consider the low entry price of $0.000004 per coin. With a projected listing price of $0.0006 post-presale, the potential for profit is substantial. It’s a prime example of why this coin is among the best meme coins to invest in December 2024. BTFD Coin: Innovating the Meme Coin Space BTFD Coin is making waves in the meme coin arena, primarily through its unique approach to gameplay and community engagement. The integration of a play-to-earn model not only attracts gamers but also incentivises participation within its ecosystem. Imagine earning rewards while playing games that resonate with the meme culture—it’s a win-win situation. This innovative approach aligns perfectly with the current trends in the crypto space, where gamification is becoming increasingly popular. The presale dynamics of BTFD Coin add another layer of excitement. Since its launch, the coin has surged through multiple presale stages, showcasing a healthy demand. Currently, it’s in its 12th stage, priced at $0.00013. With over 56 billion $BTFD coins sold and more than 5,700 holders, the community backing this coin is robust. Investors are flocking to BTFD Coin, eager to secure their stake in a project that’s not just about memes but about real utility and engagement. Now, let’s talk numbers. An investment of $150,000 during Stage 5, priced at $0.00005 per coin, would yield 3 billion $BTFD coins. When the price hits the projected $0.0006 at the end of the presale, that investment would translate to a whopping $1.8 million. That’s the kind of growth that gets investors buzzing, making BTFD Coin a frontrunner among the best meme coins to invest in December 2024. Book of Meme: Turning a New Page Next up is the Book of Meme, a project that’s creatively leveraging the meme culture to build a community and increase value. It’s a fresh take on the traditional meme coin concept, focusing on storytelling and user-generated content. The idea is simple yet powerful: users create and share memes, and the best ones are rewarded with tokens. This not only enhances community interaction but also incentivises creativity. The Book of Meme aims to turn the conventional narrative of meme coins on its head. Instead of merely relying on hype, it fosters a culture where users feel invested in the platform’s success. This model is particularly appealing to younger audiences who thrive on social media engagement and creativity. By gamifying the meme creation process, Book of Meme is carving out a unique place in the crypto landscape. Investors are taking notice of the potential for substantial returns. With its innovative approach, the Book of Meme is positioned as one of the best meme coins to invest in December 2024. Its community-driven model is not just about making a quick buck; it’s about building a sustainable ecosystem where everyone can thrive. As the project continues to grow, so too does the excitement around its future potential. Snek: Sneaking Upwards Finally, we have Snek, a meme coin that’s been quietly gaining traction. While it may not have the same level of mainstream attention as BTFD Coin or Book of Meme, Snek is steadily sneaking its way into the hearts of crypto enthusiasts. This coin is all about community, often leveraging humour and internet culture to create a loyal following. Snek’s appeal lies in its simplicity and relatability. It doesn’t try to overcomplicate things with grandiose promises; instead, it focuses on building a strong community. This grassroots approach can lead to organic growth, which is often more sustainable than hype-driven models. As more people discover Snek and its engaging community, the potential for upward movement in value becomes increasingly likely. The current market sentiment is highly favourable, and many analysts are predicting that Snek could be one of the best meme coins to invest in December 2024. As it continues to build its following and enhance its community engagement, investors are starting to take it seriously. Snek’s value might not skyrocket overnight, but its steady ascent could yield impressive returns for those who get in early. Conclusion Based on our research and market trends, it’s clear that the landscape of meme coins is evolving, and BTFD Coin, Book of Meme, and Snek are leading the charge. Each of these projects brings something unique to the table, whether it’s innovative gameplay, community-driven content, or a grassroots approach. For anyone looking to dive into the crypto world, these coins represent some of the best meme coins to invest in December 2024. With solid presale performances, robust community backing, and exciting potential for growth, the time to act is now. Don’t miss out on the opportunity to be part of this thrilling market—join the BTFD Coin presale now and secure your place in the future of meme coins!

Musk Loves Bitcoin (MUSKBTC), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 13,000% in price in the coming days. This is because MUSKBTC is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Musk Loves Bitcoin can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Musk Loves Bitcoin could become the next viral memecoin. Musk Loves Bitcoin launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Musk Loves Bitcoin on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Musk Loves Bitcoin by entering its contract address – 35GthqqwTd9HokNVfUzGpjsALCJbeUXXeKeJcrPCZsJB – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like MUSKBTC.

From MicroStrategy’s Bitcoin-centric strategy driving its market cap near $100 billion to US Bitcoin ETFs surpassing gold ETFs in assets under management for the first time, the cryptocurrency is solidifying its position as a formidable contender in institutional investment portfolios. MicroStrategy’s Stellar Year: A 546% Stock Surge Fueled by Bitcoin Holdings MicroStrategy (MSTR) has had a phenomenal year, with its stock price skyrocketing by 546% in 2024, propelling its market capitalization to $99.4 billion. The company’s strategic accumulation of Bitcoin has been a key driver of this unprecedented growth. This year alone, the enterprise software giant added 249,850 BTC to its holdings, bringing its total reserves to an astounding 439,000 BTC — solidifying its position as the largest corporate Bitcoin holder in the world. MicroStrategy’s current market cap is on the verge of surpassing the $100 billion milestone. With this achievement, it would outpace several prominent American companies if Bitcoin reaches higher price benchmarks. For instance, at a Bitcoin price of $138,000, MicroStrategy’s market cap could eclipse Starbucks , valued at $105.5 billion, and even Nike , which boasts a $115 billion valuation. Given its massive Bitcoin holdings, MicroStrategy’s fortunes are closely tied to the price trajectory of BTC. According to its net asset value (NAV) worksheet, the company’s fully diluted market cap stands at $114 billion, with the derived MSTR NAV hovering around $40 billion. MicroStrategy’s BTC-centric strategy means that every $1,000 move in Bitcoin’s price equates to an approximate $440 million change in the company’s market cap. The implications are profound: A modest 11% rally in Bitcoin’s price to $118,810 would push MicroStrategy’s market cap beyond Starbucks. A 32% increase in Bitcoin’s value to $140,000 would allow MicroStrategy to overtake Nike. These calculations assume MicroStrategy refrains from further adding to its Bitcoin reserves, which currently outpace its nearest corporate competitor, Marathon Digital, by an astounding 985%. The High-Stakes Bitcoin Strategy MicroStrategy’s aggressive Bitcoin acquisition strategy has drawn both praise and criticism. The company frequently issues debt to finance its Bitcoin purchases, a move that amplifies its exposure to BTC’s price movements. While this has proven immensely profitable during bullish market conditions, skeptics like Chainlink advocate Zach Rynes have expressed concern over the risks of the debt-based model. However, Ki-Young Ju, CEO of CryptoQuant, remains optimistic about MicroStrategy’s approach. In a recent post on X, he highlighted that Bitcoin has never traded below the cost basis of long-term holders, which currently stands at $30,000. Ju quipped that MicroStrategy would face financial ruin “only if an asteroid hits Earth.” MicroStrategy’s performance in 2024 demonstrates the transformative potential of a Bitcoin-centric investment strategy. Its unprecedented accumulation of BTC not only solidifies its dominance in the cryptocurrency space but also positions it to compete with traditional corporate giants in terms of market capitalization. As Bitcoin continues to rise, MicroStrategy’s future appears intertwined with the cryptocurrency’s trajectory. Whether the company reaches new milestones or grapples with market volatility, one thing remains clear: MicroStrategy has become a bellwether for corporate Bitcoin adoption and the broader integration of crypto into traditional financial markets. Bitcoin ETFs Surpass Gold Funds in AUM, Marking a Milestone for Crypto Adoption Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in the United States have outpaced gold ETFs in net assets for the first time. According to data from K33 Research, the collective assets under management (AUM) of US Bitcoin ETFs crossed $129 billion on Dec. 16, surpassing the total held in gold ETFs, which was just shy of that figure. This milestone highlights a shift in institutional investor sentiment, with asset managers increasingly favoring Bitcoin over the traditional safe-haven asset. The data includes both spot Bitcoin ETFs and those tracking Bitcoin's performance through financial derivatives like futures. The rapid rise of Bitcoin ETFs reflects a growing recognition of Bitcoin as a legitimate investment vehicle. According to Vetle Lund, K33 Research’s head of research, this achievement sheds light on Bitcoin’s emerging role in the broader financial market. Bloomberg ETF analyst Eric Balchunas added that when factoring in all Bitcoin ETFs — including spot, futures, and leveraged funds — their collective AUM reaches $130 billion, compared to $128 billion for gold ETFs. However, he noted that spot Bitcoin ETFs alone account for $120 billion, trailing gold’s $125 billion. Balchunas described Bitcoin’s ability to compete with gold ETFs in such a short timeframe as ”unreal,” particularly given that spot Bitcoin ETFs only launched in January 2024 after a protracted approval process with the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). The introduction of spot Bitcoin ETFs has been a key driver behind Bitcoin’s dominance in the ETF landscape. These funds, which directly hold Bitcoin rather than derivatives, have attracted significant inflows since their debut, breaking the $100 billion AUM threshold in November. BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) has emerged as the frontrunner among Bitcoin ETFs, with nearly $60 billion in AUM. In November, IBIT overtook BlackRock’s own gold ETF, the iShares Gold Trust (IAU), marking a symbolic victory for the cryptocurrency over the precious metal. The surge in Bitcoin ETF assets also mirrors broader optimism about Bitcoin’s future. Bryan Armour, director of passive strategies research at Morningstar, noted that the 2024 US presidential election results, which saw Donald Trump secure a victory, played a pivotal role in boosting Bitcoin ETF performance. The post-election period brought over $5 billion in inflows, reflecting renewed confidence in Bitcoin as an asset class. The growing interest in Bitcoin ETFs aligns with what analysts call the “debasement trade.” This trend refers to investors seeking refuge in assets like gold and Bitcoin amid economic uncertainties and rising geopolitical tensions. A report from JPMorgan in October highlighted several factors driving this shift, including structurally higher geopolitical uncertainty since 2022, persistent inflation concerns, and worries about high government deficits across major economies. These factors have made both gold and Bitcoin attractive options for investors preparing for potential ”catastrophic scenarios.” On Dec. 16, Bitcoin’s purchasing power relative to gold reached a new all-time high as well, as BTC prices surged to record levels. A Paradigm Shift in Asset Allocation Bitcoin ETFs surpassing gold funds in AUM represents a significant turning point in the investment landscape. While gold has long been the go-to asset for preserving wealth during times of uncertainty, Bitcoin is rapidly emerging as a modern alternative. Its appeal lies in its potential for high returns, ease of transferability, and growing mainstream acceptance. The milestone also highlights the success of institutional players like BlackRock in legitimizing Bitcoin through regulated financial products. By offering investors a secure and accessible way to gain exposure to Bitcoin, these ETFs have played a crucial role in driving adoption. Despite its remarkable ascent, Bitcoin still faces challenges, including regulatory scrutiny, market volatility, and skepticism from traditional financial institutions. However, its performance in 2024 has demonstrated resilience and a growing ability to compete with established assets like gold. As Bitcoin ETFs continue to attract inflows, they could reshape the broader financial market by encouraging more institutional and retail investors to allocate capital to digital assets. This shift not only elevates Bitcoin’s status but also paves the way for broader cryptocurrency adoption in traditional finance.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|FIAT|MARKET|TRADING,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2024-12-18 05:30:00
33767162,[object Object],1734499825,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/33767162.jpeg,"Just 104 Ethereum Whales Control 57% Of All Supply, Data Reveals",https://bitcoinist.com/104-ethereum-whales-57-of-all-supply-data-reveals/,"On-chain data shows the most massive Ethereum whales control most of the supply, with their holdings only continuing to grow. Ethereum Mega Whales Own More Than 57% Of All Tokens In Existence In a new post on X, the on-chain analytics firm Santiment has discussed how the ETH supply held by the different segments of the user base has looked recently. The indicator of relevance here is the “ Supply Distribution ,” which keeps track of the percentage of the Ethereum circulating supply that a given wallet group is holding right now. Addresses or investors are divided into these cohorts based on the number of coins they carry in their balance. For instance, the 1 to 10 coins group includes all wallets owning between 1 and 10 ETH. In the context of the current topic, three broad ranges containing multiple cohorts are of interest: 0 to 100 coins, 100 to 100,000 coins, and 100,000+ coins. The first includes the market’s small hands, like the retail investors. These holders don’t have holdings that amount to much in the grand scheme of things, so they individually don’t hold any importance in the market. In the second cohort, the 100 to 100,000 coins one, the wallets start becoming a bit large, but only toward the end of the range. The range includes two of the key investor groups in the sector, the sharks and whales . The whales are significantly more massive than the sharks, so they are the cohort carrying the more importance in the market. Finally, the largest addresses on the network hold more than 100,000 ETH. At the current price, this amount nears $400 million, so the investors in this group would be quite massive indeed. An appropriate name for them would perhaps be “ mega whales .” Now, here is the chart shared by the analytics firm that shows the trend in the Supply Distribution for these three Ethereum wallet ranges over the past decade: As displayed in the above graph, the percentage of the Ethereum supply held by the mega whales has risen over the past couple of years. At the same time, both smaller wallet ranges have lost dominance, with the sharks and whales in particular witnessing a rather steep drop. The mega whales, consisting of only 104 members, today own 57.35% of the ETH supply, a new all-time high. Meanwhile, the holdings of the sharks and whales sit at an all-time low of 33.46%. Generally, the centralization of supply isn’t positive for any cryptocurrency. Still, it matters especially for Ethereum as the network runs on a consensus mechanism based on the Proof-of-Stake (PoS). This means that if an entity or a group of entities controls 51% of the supply, they can take over the network. That said, many mega whales would not be ‘real’ investors but wallets belonging to staking pools and other platforms, who merely hold the coins in one place on behalf of many investors.

That’s the question many investors are asking following the crypto market’s post- bull run cooloff. Savvy traders are seizing the opportunity to take new positions. In fact, the SHIB meme coin had 15% in weekly gains while PEPE toppled Uniswap’s valuation. Meanwhile, the Rollblock presale has surged past $7 million , capturing attention with its unique “GambleFi” model and staking rewards. $7.3M and counting: Rollblock crypto casino set presale record ahead of the bull run The meme hype is gaining ground, and so is the innovation that Rollblock brings to the iGaming scene. Since its launch, Rollblock’s crypto presale has been gaining traction as one of the most talked-about opportunities in the altcoin market. Currently in stage nine presale , Rollblock has raised over $7.3M as a vote of confidence for its iGaming ingenuity. The reasons are crystal clear! The project stands out for its unique “GambleFi” model, which combines crypto gaming and staking features. Unlike traditional casinos and their pitfalls, Rollblock focuses on security and transparency by leveraging Ethereum’s smart contract. Its novel AI-powered betting tools designed to enhance user experience have also struck a chord with many punters. That’s why its ongoing presale is being compared to PEPE and SHIB ‘s meme success. The market is buzzing, and Rollblock is still selling at a discounted $0.0415. Shiba Inu shows signs of bullishness. A new bull run or a fakeout? Another altcoin that savvy traders have been hoarding ahead of the bull run is the beloved dog-themed Shiba Inu meme coin . Over the past week, Shiba Inu has shown bullish signs after breaking new levels with a 15% MoM gain to $0.00003. The meme coin ‘s outstanding performance and community-driven ecosystem development fueled the HODLing. Shiba Inu ‘s robust burn mechanism got a reface from the 1 CENT DREAM project to incinerate supply and aid price rise. Adding to the positive sentiment, Shiba Inu ‘s Shibarium L2 has reached a new milestone—$6M in TVL, 2M addresses, and over 60M transactions processed. Investors’ confidence is also on the rise, and some analysts are forecasting its rise to $80M in valuation. PEPE meme coin overtakes UNI as whales pour in billions PEPE faithful are also reaping the fruit of their foresight even before the bull run began. The frog-inspired meme coin broke the record—$11B market cap after overtaking UNI. This achievement represents an astounding 18x growth from its humble beginnings at $591 million earlier this year. This month’s performance is no different. PEPE has surged 150% on the heels of whales pouring in $1.14B. The token’s rally was further bolstered by its Dec. 5 listing on Binance.US and expanded accessibility through platforms like Robinhood and MoonPay. The milestones have exposed PEPE to newer investors, and analysts predict more upside during the bull run . Conclusion The crypto market’s full steam saw a cooldown, and savvy traders are already capitalizing on opportunities that signal massive future gains. Shiba Inu ‘s bullish breakout and PEPE ‘s record-smashing milestones show the enduring power of meme coins . Yet, Rollblock’s impressive $7.3M presale and innovative “GambleFi” model are turning heads as the next big contender. For investors, this dip isn’t just a cooldown—it’s the perfect time to position for explosive returns. Discover the exciting opportunities of the Rollblock (RBLK) presale today!

Factors adding to this rally are major expectations of lower interest rate cuts in December, as it typically helped Bitcoin. Another factor that boosted this rally was the inclusion of MicroStrategy in the Nasdaq 100 index . In an X post, Bloomberg’s Eric Balchunas, tagging James Seyffart on X, revealed that Bitcoin-Ethereum combo ETFs are likely to launch first, followed by Hedera (HBAR). Solana (SOL) and XRP ETFs might take longer due to their legal battles with the SEC. We expect a wave of cryptocurrency ETFs next year, albeit not all at once.

It is also evident that Atkins’ lighter regulatory approach could streamline the way for a broader range of crypto ETFs. Spotlight on Solana and XRP ETFs While proposals for Solana and XRP ETFs have been submitted, approval is unlikely until the new SEC leadership takes over in January. Bloomberg analysts suggest these funds could see the green light by late 2025. Nate Geraci, President of ETF Store, has also joined the conversation stating, “It’s highly likely Solana ETFs will be approved by the end of next year at the latest.” Bitcoin adoption and the rise of crypto ETFs are driving prices to new heights—Read Bitcoin price prediction to see where it’s headed next! Altcoins in Focus Other altcoin ETFs, including those for Litecoin (LTC) and Hedera (HBAR), could gain approval sooner due to their regulatory clarity. Seyffart highlighted that neither Litecoin nor HBAR has been classified as a security by the SEC, which simplifies their path to market. However, he questioned whether there’s sufficient investor demand for these products. Looking ahead, the number of altcoins ETF applications is expected to triple in the coming months, reflecting growing interest in diversifying crypto investment options. Issuers appear confident in the regulatory shift, with Two Prime Digital Assets CEO Alexander Blume remarking, “They wouldn’t waste the time and expense if they didn’t believe approval was likely.” .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : XRP is the Largest Token After BTC & ETH Despite Trading Below $3-Here’s What to Expect if the Price Marks an ATH , The market is opening doors for alternative investment options since Bitcoin is getting high the market needs fresh inflow.

However, every once in a while, a project comes along that catches the attention of industry veterans and sparks conversations about its potential to redefine the entire space. As we approach 2024, crypto experts are fixated on a new blockchain challenger that promises to address long-standing issues like scalability, sustainability, and integration with emerging technologies such as artificial intelligence (AI). Lightchain Protocol AI Presale Could this be the blockchain project that sets the new standard for the industry? Here’s why experts are so intrigued. The Challenges of Current Industry Leaders Blockchain giants like Ethereum, Solana, and Binance Smart Chain have made remarkable strides, but each comes with its own set of challenges: Ethereum: Its high gas fees and reliance on Layer 2 solutions to scale often frustrate users and developers. Solana: Known for its speed, Solana has faced network outages and questions about centralization. Binance Smart Chain: While efficient, it has been criticized for prioritizing performance over true decentralization. These pain points highlight the need for a blockchain that can combine high performance, decentralization, and innovative integration—all while being accessible and sustainable. The Features Turning Heads The blockchain gaining traction among experts is rumored to introduce groundbreaking features that directly address these gaps. Although details are still limited, here’s what we know so far: Lightchain Protocol AI Presale 1. A Revolutionary Consensus Mechanism The platform is said to use an entirely new consensus mechanism—possibly called Proof of Intelligence (PoI)—that leverages AI-driven computations to validate transactions. This could significantly improve energy efficiency and scalability while rewarding meaningful contributions to the network. 2. AI Integration at Its Core With an integrated Artificial Intelligence Virtual Machine (AIVM), this blockchain goes beyond mere decentralization. It enables developers to create dApps that utilize real-time AI for predictive analytics, automation, and advanced decision-making. 3. Seamless Scalability Unlike many existing blockchains, this project reportedly achieves scalability without sacrificing decentralization or security. By eliminating the need for complex Layer 2 solutions, it promises a more streamlined and user-friendly experience. 4. Environmentally Friendly Operations Sustainability has become a critical factor for blockchain adoption, and this challenger claims to have addressed this through its innovative consensus mechanism, which dramatically reduces energy consumption. Lightchain Protocol AI Presale Why Experts Are Taking Notice Crypto experts are excited about this project because it tackles the most pressing issues holding back widespread blockchain adoption.

The market’s baseline expectation is a 25 bps rate cut by the central bank, which can lead to some optimism. Notably, traders are staying cautious before making further moves. Crypto billionaire Arthur Hayes predicted major turbulence in Bitcoin and crypto market during Donald Trump’s oath-taking ceremony on January 20. Bitcoin Price Retraces Ahead Fed Rate Cut Decision Just hours before the Fed rate cut decision, Bitcoin price is seeing some selling pressure retracing under $104,000 levels. Bank of America executive Mark Cabana noted that the US central bank is likely to announce a 25 bps rate cut amid concerns about maintaining a restrictive monetary policy for too long. Although labor markets show signs of moderation, inflation remains sticky with CPI surging to 2.8% in November from 2.4% in September. While the markets have already priced at the 25 basis points rate cut, analysts are curious about the US Fed Chair Powell’s comments on the 2025 monetary policy. Amid stick inflation, the US Federal Reserve might reduce 2025 rate cuts to three from the previously projected four rate cuts. This shows that the US central bank will once again turn hawkish in order to bring inflation under its desired 2% target. Kurt S Altrichter , the founder of Ivory Hill Wealth noted: “Tomorrow’s Fed meeting isn’t just about the expected rate cut — it’s about how committed the Fed remains to rate cuts in 2025. More cuts = better for stocks and bonds. Fewer cuts = markets adjust expectations”. On-Chain Data Signals Sell-Off Amid this uncertainty, short-term holders have opted for heavy profit booking during the recent meeting. On-chain analytics platform Santiment reported that BTC holders holding the asset for 90 to 365 days have been capitalizing on profits above $100K levels. In contrast, longer-term holders , who were active in the $90,000–$100,000 price range, have shown significantly less activity once the price surpassed $100,000. Source: Santiment Bitcoin Price Retracement Likely This Week If history repeats, the Bitcoin price is likely to see some retracement this week. As BTC has entered week 7 of its price discovery, popular crypto analyst Rekt Capital expects a pullback ahead. Highlighting data from previous cycles, the analyst notes that: In 2013, Bitcoin experienced a pullback during Week 7 of price discovery. In 2017, the cryptocurrency retraced by 34% in Week 8. In 2021, Bitcoin saw a 16% decline in Week 6. Thus, if BTC repeats history, we can expect a similar pullback which can take the Bitcoin price under $100K as well. Rekt Capital warns that such corrections are a normal part of Bitcoin’s cycle and have historically erased weeks of gains in a short time. BitMEX co-founder Arthur Hayes predicts market correction, forecasting a significant downturn around January 20 — Donald Trump’s presidential inauguration day. Hayes added that his Maelstrom investment fund plans to lighten up certain positions ahead of the anticipated market turbulence. Traders are going with liquidation, investors may not sell their holdings as top analysts including Peter Brandt predicted Bitcoin price to hit $125K. As of press time, BTC price is trading 2.5% down at $103,820, with its daily trading volume dropping 10%. The Coinglass liquidation data also shows $71 million in BTC liquidation in the last 24 hours. with $48 million in long liquidations.

Bitfinex’s latest reports suggest when BTC’s peak could come and how much climbing might be left for the flagship crypto. Related Reading: Bitcoin To Hit $180,000 If These Cycle Top Indicators Are Absent, Says VanEck’s Sigel Bitcoin’s ‘Unique’ Cycle In its latest Alpha Report, Bitfinex highlighted the crypto industry’s big strides in adoption and mainstream recognition this year, which have differentiated this cycle from previous ones. Notably, the launch and increasing institutional demand of Bitcoin and Ethereum spot exchange-traded funds (ETFs) have surpassed expectations and attracted a “new class of investors” to the crypto space. Per the report, this cycle has been “unique” as these new investors brought by ETFs and increasing confidence in the sector sent BTC’s price to a new ATH ahead of the Halving event, historically leading the flagship crypto to a new high after 5-7 months. The industry also saw a growing interest in diversifying national reserves with cryptocurrencies, with several jurisdictions worldwide considering implementing a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve after the flagship crypto’s recent performance. According to Bitfinex analysts, these factors have kept BTC’s corrections smaller than other cycles and will likely continue this trend for the rest of the bull run: In the current bull cycle, which began in mid to late 2023, Bitcoinʼs corrections have been smaller, particularly since the launch of Bitcoin ETFs in early 2024. With institutional and ETF demand providing consistent buying pressure, we expect this trend to continue, keeping future corrections limited and potentially shorter in duration. Moreover, the upcoming crypto-friendly US administration added to the growing bullish sentiment surrounding the industry, leading to the massive post-election rally. As a result, the crypto market has grown 130% year-to-date (YTD) to a market capitalization of $3.69 trillion, increasing nearly 70% this quarter. What’s Next For Bitcoin This Cycle? The report noted Bitcoin’s performance, highlighting its 573% surge from its 2022 low of $15,487. The flagship crypto has also seen an increase of 130% year-to-date (YTD), fueled by this year’s industry achievements. Earlier this month, Bitcoin broke past the $100,000 barrier for the first time, setting a new ATH closer to the $110,000 level on Monday. According to Bitfinex, the cryptocurrency still has several levels to climb in 2025, as historical data indicates that the market is mid-cycle. This data suggests BTC’s price will likely peak around Q3 and Q4 2025, as it tends to do approximately 450 days post-halving. Meanwhile, metrics like Market Value to Realized Value (MVRV), Net Unrealized Profit and Loss (NUPL), and the Bull-Bear market indicator signal that “we remain in the bull phase but far from euphoric peaks.” Bitfinex also explained that the Pi Cycle Top Indicator has historically been effective in timing cycle highs, forecasting the peaks with a three-day window. The previous cycle’s predictions indicate that Bitcoin could peak between mid-2025 and early-2026.

Nonetheless, the report notes that the flagship crypto has been on a trend of diminishing returns over the cycles. Based on this, Bitcoin’s price might see a 15% to 20% increase to the $160,000-$200,000 range instead. However, if the cryptocurrency mirrors 2017’s cycle pattern, BTC’s rally could extend until January of 2026, peaking at $229,000 with similar diminishing returns. As of this writing, BTC is trading at $107,729, just 0.3% below its ATH.

It piggybacks on this to amass a community of hungry traders and equips them with market-beating tools. These include trading signals, meme coin picks, a trading insiders group, staking, and trading rewards. The project raised a staggering $27 million in its first week of presale, which took Pepe Unchained five months to achieve. As such, the Wall Street Pepe ICO looks set to sell out in days or weeks.

Visit Flockerz Presale Solaxy Pepe Unchained raised over $70 million in its ICO for the first Pepe-themed Ethereum layer 2 blockchain. This shows a massive demand for layer 2 technology. With that in mind, Solaxy could be one of the strongest ICOs on the market right now. It’s the first Solana layer 2 blockchain, making Solana even more scalable than it already is. https://twitter.com/SOLAXYTOKEN/status/1867318005660889427 Due to Solana’s sheer popularity, it suffers from congestion issues despite being capable of 6,500 transactions per second (TPS). This leads to longer wait times, higher fees, and sometimes transaction failures. Solaxy fixes this by batching transactions and computing them off the main network before reporting them back to Solana for finality. This enhances Solana’s transactional capabilities, making transactions cheaper, faster, and smoother. Solaxy launched its ICO four days ago and has raised $630K so far. The current price is $0.001558, but this will rise later today.

Citing Bitcoin’s potential to strengthen the US dollar and enhance national economic security, the document outlines a framework for establishing it as a strategic reserve asset within the US Treasury’s Exchange Stabilization Fund (ESF). The draft, titled “Executive Order Designating Bitcoin as a Strategic Reserve Asset within the Exchange Stabilization Fund,” states that it is important for the United States to adapt to global financial innovations in order to maintain its economic leadership. It describes Bitcoin as a “decentralized and limited store of value asset” comparable to digital gold. The proposal addresses three key objectives: Establishment of the Strategic Bitcoin Reserve (SBR): The SBR will promote economic flexibility by increasing the diversity of U.S. reserve assets. Bitcoin Designation as a Strategic Asset: The bill positions Bitcoin as a key component of U.S. financial dominance, allowing for its inclusion in the ESF. Leadership in the Digital Assets Industry: The plan aims to attract capital, talent, and businesses in the digital assets industry to the United States. Related News: Tragicomic Event on This Altcoin: An Investor Turns $10,000 into $3 in Seconds The draft outlines specific actions to achieve these goals: Creation of the Strategic Bitcoin Reserve: Led by the Secretary of the Treasury, the SBR will operate under strict security, regular audits, and comprehensive reporting to ensure transparency and long-term accountability. Consolidation of Government Bitcoin Assets: Within seven days of the Executive Order going into effect, all Bitcoin held by federal agencies, including those seized in legal proceedings, will be transferred to the SBR. Purchase Program for Bitcoin: The Treasury will implement a Bitcoin purchase program within 60 days that aims to position the U.S. as a global leader in digital assets. *This is not investment advice.

Trump’s promise to fire SEC Chair Gary Gensler on day one seems to be coming true, as Gensler announced his resignation on January 20, the same day Trump is inaugurated. This big news helped push XRP to new yearly highs. Plus, Ripple’s RLUSD launched on December 17, taking a big step toward global growth. Meanwhile, SEC Commissioner Caroline Crenshaw became a target of the crypto community due to her strong anti-crypto stance and was denied renomination. All of these events could lead to something big on January 15, especially with Paul Atkins soon taking over as SEC Chair. Many are hopeful that this will bring a more relaxed approach to crypto regulation. What Will Happen on January 15? The SEC has requested an extension to file its principal brief in the ongoing XRP lawsuit with Ripple Labs. The new deadline for filing is set for January 15, 2025. According to attorney Fred Rispoli, this part of the case is strictly about paperwork — no new evidence or jury trial. There are two appeals in process: one from the SEC and another from Ripple, called a “cross-appeal.” Each side will submit an opening brief, followed by an opposition brief, and then a reply brief. Afterward, there will be a 15-minute oral argument in front of three judges . Fred said that while the argument is brief, it will be crucial, as the judges’ questions can provide insight into their initial thoughts on the case. However, he also said that the entire process could take up to a year and a half, despite the short duration of the oral argument. Even if the legal case continues, supporters remain optimistic that the new government will implement the right measures to support the crypto industry. Another bullish development is that Empower Oversight is urging Congress to release an SEC Inspector General report on former chairman Jay Clayton’s actions.
