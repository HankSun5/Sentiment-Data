After reaching an all-time high (ATH) on November 22, Solana has experienced a 23% retracement, testing investor confidence. However, analysts remain optimistic, with many expecting a significant upward move in the coming weeks. Related Reading: Ethereum Forming A Symmetrical Pattern – Key Resistance At $4,100 Renowned analyst Jelle recently shared a technical analysis highlighting Solana’s strong potential. According to Jelle, the monthly chart for SOL is primed for an “absolute monster run,” indicating that the current consolidation phase may be laying the groundwork for a powerful breakout. This view aligns with the broader sentiment that Solana’s resilience above $210 could act as a springboard for the next phase of its rally. As one of the leading altcoins in the crypto market, Solana has attracted attention for its robust performance and potential to lead the next leg of the bull market. With the price now consolidating after a sharp pullback, all eyes are on SOL’s ability to maintain its critical support and reclaim momentum. Whether Solana can deliver on its bullish promise will be a key focus for traders and investors alike in the coming weeks. Solana Holds Key Demand Solana is currently trading above a critical level for this cycle—the $210 mark. This price point, which previously acted as a significant resistance, has now flipped into a vital support level, setting the stage for Solana’s next potential rally. The importance of this level cannot be overstated, as it represents a key area where buyers are stepping in to defend SOL’s bullish momentum. Renowned analyst Jelle recently shared a compelling technical analysis on X, emphasizing Solana’s strong outlook. According to Jelle, Solana’s monthly chart is primed for what he described as an “absolute monster run.” His analysis highlights how SOL’s price is now testing its 2021 all-time high (ATH) as support, a critical juncture that could determine its trajectory in the weeks to come. Jelle’s simple yet powerful chart indicates that if Solana manages to push decisively above the $210 level, it will confirm the strength of this support and potentially trigger a massive bull run. This rally could result in impressive gains for SOL, positioning it as a standout performer in the crypto market. Related Reading: Bitcoin Breaks ATH Pushing Back Into Price Discovery – BTC To $130K? For now, all eyes are on Solana’s ability to sustain its momentum and break higher. As it consolidates above this essential level, traders and investors are closely monitoring its next moves, anticipating the possibility of a historic price surge. Price Action Suggests A Big Move Soon Solana is trading at $221, maintaining its strength above the critical $210 support level. This resilience has bolstered confidence among investors, as SOL’s price action aligns bullishly across all time frames. Solana is gearing up for a major rally, but it must first overcome the $245 resistance level to confirm the uptrend. Market dynamics indicate that SOL is in a prime position for upward momentum. Unlike other assets that may show signs of hesitation or potential consolidation, Solana exhibits a well-defined price structure that strongly favors a breakout. The lack of bearish signals further solidifies this outlook, as there is little indication of an imminent correction or prolonged sideways trading.

If SOL successfully breaches the $245 resistance with strength, it could trigger a wave of buying pressure, propelling the price to new heights.

The stock’s been on a tear, climbing 40% since the U.S. presidential election. At $476.73, Tesla’s market cap now sits at a jaw-dropping $1.53 trillion. Compare that to Nvidia—last year’s golden child of growth stocks—sitting at $129.92 with a market cap of $318 billion. Analysts aren’t missing a beat. Tesla and Nvidia are two sides of the same coin: both are fueled by a tech future that seems unstoppable. Tesla has cars and autonomous tech; Nvidia has chips and AI infrastructure. One builds the machine, the other runs the software. Yet while Nvidia’s growth is starting to cool, Tesla’s numbers keep pulling investors in. Tesla’s 52-week range speaks volumes: it’s climbed from $138.80 all the way to $483.99 this year. Nvidia has moved between $47.32 and $152.89, a solid performance but far from Tesla’s high-octane climb. Why Wall Street’s watching Tesla like it watched Nvidia Cathie Wood, CEO of Ark Invest, says she sees Tesla hitting $2,600 by 2029, driven by what she calls “unmatched growth” in profits and revenues. If Wood’s predictions play out, Tesla could hit an enterprise value of $8.2 trillion in just five years. That makes Nvidia’s peak look tame by comparison. Investors are biting. The excitement is Tesla’s move toward AI-powered autonomous driving. It’s no secret Tesla isn’t just an electric car company anymore. Self-driving software and its robotaxi ambitions have Wall Street betting on a future Tesla that doesn’t just sell cars—it sells rides, powered by AI. Tesla’s strategy echoes Nvidia’s dominance during the AI boom. Nvidia’s chips became essential to generative AI development, fueling companies like OpenAI and driving profits to record highs. Tesla’s AI, on the other hand, lives on the roads. If it perfects autonomous driving, its software will become as essential as Nvidia’s chips. But there’s a catch. Tesla trades at a staggering price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 162. Nvidia’s ratio? A much more palatable 51.14. That makes Tesla a high-risk, high-reward bet. Goldman Sachs recently pointed this out, cautioning that Tesla’s valuation may be running ahead of its earnings. Nvidia’s growth is slowing, Tesla’s just getting started Nvidia is still the face of AI infrastructure, but the cracks are showing. After growing revenue by over 200% in recent quarters, analysts now expect Nvidia’s growth to slow to around 70%. Still impressive, but a clear sign that the AI boom is leveling out. Nvidia’s reliance on a handful of mega clients—like cloud giants and AI startups—has some investors worried. Tesla, meanwhile, is all momentum. The market sees a company that’s just scratching the surface of its AI potential. Self-driving cars are Tesla’s big bet. The trading data backs this up. Tesla has been gaining traction as one of Wall Street’s most traded stocks. Nvidia still holds the crown, with 197 million shares traded on December 17 compared to Tesla’s 108 million. Investors go all in on US stocks The bullish sentiment on Tesla is part of a broader trend. Bank of America’s Global Fund Manager Survey shows investors are dumping cash and going all in on equities. Cash allocations hit their lowest point since 2001, falling from 4.3% to 3.9%. That’s a sign investors are chasing gains and aren’t interested in sitting on the sidelines. Michael Hartnett, a strategist at Bank of America, called the mood “super-bullish.” Tesla’s surge, fueled by its AI story, is a perfect fit for this environment. Wall Street sees a growth machine, and it’s hungry for more. Interest rate cuts are adding fuel to the fire. Traders expect the Federal Reserve to start cutting rates, making stocks even more attractive. The S&P 500 is on track to close 2024 up more than 26%, far beyond anyone’s expectations. Analysts now predict another 10% climb next year, with growth stocks like Tesla leading the way. Nvidia played that role in 2023. Now Tesla’s taking the baton.

Her push for a national Bitcoin reserve comes amid a historic market upsurge that has propelled the world’s largest crypto by market capitalization to new heights in recent weeks, with BTC today marking a new record high above $108,000. No To Digital Euro, Yes To Strategic BTC Reserve In a speech before the European parliament, Sarah Knafo urged European lawmakers to establish a strategic BTC reserve. Knafo declared, “It is time to protect our people from inflation and the poor economic choices of our states.” She then reiterated her statements in a post on X (aka Twitter). She also cautioned that the European Central Bank’s plans of launching a central bank digital currency could result in a “dystopian world” where transactions are monitored, and citizens are debunked for simple remarks on social media platforms. The lawmaker stated, “it is time to bet on freedom,” adding: “No to the digital euro, yes to a strategic Bitcoin reserve.” Knafo further indicated that it’s time for the ECB to stop “totalitarian temptations” by urging a shift from regulatory overreach in crypto to adopting the decentralized nature of Bitcoin. She pointed out that Europe has adopted a different approach to crypto. While the U.S. mulls a strategic, national stockpile of the top cryptocurrency, local regulators in Europe have been mostly focused on regulation, taxation, and suppressing innovation. Knafo highlighted the outstanding success of El Salvador, where President Nayib Bukele made the unpopular decision to make Bitcoin legal tender in late 2021. Bukele was harshly criticized by U.S. politicians, the World Bank, and the IMF for the move. Nonetheless, the Latin American nation’s Bitcoin experiment has paid off handsomely , garnering over $300 million in unrealized profits so far. Calls To Stockpile Bitcoin Gain Traction Around The World Knafo’s speech comes as the U.S. stance toward Bitcoin undergoes massive changes following Donald Trump’s win against Kamala Harris last month. Trump and his allies have frequently voiced their support behind legislation to create a Bitcoin strategic reserve and will soon be well-positioned to make that a reality. Several U.S. lawmakers have made pushes to establish a strategic Bitcoin reserve. Binance ex-CEO Changpeng “CZ” Zhao recently forecasted the BTC reserve policy would be imitated globally. “This also has a knock-on effect on other countries in the world. If the U.S. is doing this, then every other country will have to do this,” he posited at the Bitcoin MENA conference last week. Notably, government officials in Brazil have already submitted legislation to realize that possibility, while a Japanese lawmaker named Satoshi put forth a formal request to his nation’s legislature last week to start a discussion about developing a national Bitcoin reserve for Japan.",Bitcoin|News|Bitcoin News|El Salvador,EN,0,0,ASIA|BTC|FIAT|MARKET|REGULATION,"{'name': 'ZyCrypto', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/zycrypto.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",zycrypto,2024-12-17 22:43:57

Cynthia Lummis",https://www.cryptopolitan.com/pro-digital-asset/,"Senator Cynthia Lummis believes 2025 will be a key year for Bitcoin, with the U.S. leading in digital assets under David Sacks. She proposes a Bitcoin reserve to protect against inflation and increase the dollar value. And believes the most pro digital asset administration ever. The year 2025 is looking like a big moment for Bitcoin and digital assets, with strong administration supporting their future. Senator Cynthia Lummis from Wyoming said that 2025 will be the year Bitcoin takes off. She believes the U.S. will become the world leader in digital assets and financial innovation. The Appointment of David Sacks as “Crypto Czar” Announcements comes with the appointment of David Sacks as the “Crypto Czar. ” David Sacks is a prominent venture capitalist and one of the early PayPal executives with deep knowledge and understanding of the tech world. Sacks has advocated for Bitcoin and other digital currencies, and many in the crypto community see him as a strong figure who can help shape policies that the growth of digital assets. Senator Lummis strongly supports Sacks’ leadership and believes that the U.S. will take a leading role in digital assets under his guidance. “ Under David Sacks’ leadership, the U.S. is primed to lead the world in digital assets and financial innovation,” said Lummis. Michael Saylor also supports this vision. He shares Lummis’ excitement, saying, “Under David Sacks’ leadership, the U.S. will not only lead the world in digital assets but also set the stage for financial innovation like we’ve never seen before.” Saylor’s endorsement of Sacks shows that many influential figures in the crypto community believe that this leadership is the key to true potential of digital assets in the U.S. Lummis’ Vision on Strategic Bitcoin Reserve One of Lummis’ bold proposals is the idea of a “strategic Bitcoin reserve” and mentions ” My Strategic Reserve.” This would involve the U.S. government acquiring and holding Bitcoin as part of its financial reserves, similar to how the country holds gold today. Lummis believes that Bitcoin can serve as a store of value that will protect the U.S. from inflation, strengthen the U.S. dollar, and improve the country’s financial health. She said, “I look forward to working closely with David Sacks to pass comprehensive digital asset legislation and my strategic Bitcoin reserve.” If adopted, this idea could change how the U.S. approaches its financial reserves and set an example for other countries to follow. The strategic Bitcoin reserve is not just a theoretical idea Lummis has suggested that the U.S. could use existing gold certificates to purchase Bitcoin without affecting the balance sheet. This could save billions of dollars and make the country’s financial system more resilient. With the right leadership and support, such a proposal could be a game changer for the global economy. The idea of the U.S. government formally adopting Bitcoin into its financial strategy would greatly increase the cryptocurrency market. Some states in the U.S., like Wisconsin and Michigan, have already begun experimenting with crypto in their investment portfolios. However, if the federal government takes action and incorporates Bitcoin into its reserves, it could open the doors for even more institutional investors and major players in the global financial markets. 2025 holds much promise for Bitcoin and digital assets. With leaders like Senator Cynthia Lummis, David Sacks, and Michael Saylor working together, the U.S. is on track to become the global leader in digital assets and financial innovation.

Trump Patriot (TRUMPPAT), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 19,000% in price in the coming days. This is because TRUMPPAT is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Trump Patriot can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Trump Patriot could become the next viral memecoin. Trump Patriot launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Trump Patriot on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Trump Patriot by entering its contract address – 9hmvtogFEjzZQMFfJ5Hiq7fQSq7E38mG3Qjb7X42qM6P – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like TRUMPPAT.

Sim, previously sanctioned by OFAC, oversaw the schemes, leveraging a complex web of crypto exchanges, money mules, and shell companies. Crypto cash-outs and the UAE connection The network’s key players operated primarily out of the United Arab Emirates. Lu Huaying, a Chinese national, allegedly began converting North Korean-obscured cryptocurrency into cash in early 2022. Between then and September 2023, Lu successfully laundered millions of dollars on behalf of Sim Hyon Sop. The scheme used money mules and crypto-to-fiat conversions to disguise the funds’ origins, allowing the DPRK to purchase goods and services essential for its missile development. Zhang Jian, another Chinese national based in the UAE, stepped in later. Between late 2022 and early 2023, Zhang facilitated fiat currency exchanges for Sim and allegedly acted as a cash courier. The funds, moved through layers of intermediaries, ultimately financed North Korea’s weapons programs. Green Alpine Trading, LLC, served as the core of the operation. Registered in the UAE, the front company was integral to the laundering process, providing Sim’s network with the infrastructure to move money seamlessly across borders. OFAC said Green Alpine attempted to provide “financial, material, and technological support” for North Korea’s illicit operations. The sanctions now freeze all U.S.-linked property and financial assets tied to Lu, Zhang, and Green Alpine Trading. Any entity controlled 50% or more by the sanctioned individuals or company is also blocked. U.S. citizens and institutions are barred from engaging with the network. North Korea’s crypto laundering tactics revealed North Korea’s strategy is simple but effective: steal crypto, launder it, and cash it out through proxies . Digital assets, with their anonymity and decentralized nature, have become critical to the DPRK’s revenue generation. The regime exploits cybercrime, fraudulent IT work, and stolen funds to bypass international sanctions. Sim Hyon Sop, the architect of the UAE-based operation, represents North Korea’s Korea Kwangson Banking Corp (KKBC). KKBC is a state-run entity already blacklisted under U.S. and United Nations sanctions for its role in funding the DPRK’s WMD programs. From China, Sim directs these schemes, setting up shell companies and managing bank accounts to obscure the origin of the funds. The Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) has long pointed to individuals like Sim as key players. They work as agents for state-backed institutions, pulling strings behind the scenes while using intermediaries like Lu and Zhang to handle the dirty work. By relying on trusted proxies, Sim’s network operates across multiple jurisdictions with minimal direct involvement from Pyongyang. The scale of North Korea’s crypto operations is staggering. Since 2017, estimates show that Pyongyang has stolen over $3 billion in cryptocurrency. These funds directly finance its ballistic missile and nuclear weapons programs, fueling the regime’s military ambitions while evading traditional banking systems.

The draft was reportedly presented by @btcpolicyorg as an executive order focusing on making Bitcoin a strategic reserve asset within the Exchange Stabilization Fund (ESF). The two-page document addressed certain key points the institute recognized as important to cover in what many consider a preliminary draft. Recommendations to gain a competitive advantage with Bitcoin The executive order describes Bitcoin as a strategic reserve asset that can bolster the US dollar’s resilience. It also demands the establishment of a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve (SBR) to serve as a permanent national asset for economic security. According to the draft, the US policy should include: Creating the Bitcoin reserve to grow the economy and maintain the US’s financial dominance in world markets. Making Bitcoin a strategic asset stored by the government to diversify national reserves and boost economic security. Striving to make the US the number one country for digital assets in terms of attracting investment, talent, and innovation. The draft highlights the need for the United States to adapt to global trends in digital finance as this is the only way to maintain economic stability and leadership. It also tags Bitcoin as a decentralized and finite store-of-value asset, with comparisons to digital gold — a sentiment many crypto stakeholders seem to agree with. MicroStrategy ’s Michael Saylor has even gone as far as suggesting the US sell all its gold to buy BTC. It may sound over the top, but Micahel Saylor has overtly supported Bitcoin, and his BTC gamble has paid off exponentially. Establishment of the SBR and Bitcoin designation According to the draft, the SBR will be handled by the Treasury Department, which will have strict oversight, including audits and security measures. The draft also recommended that any Bitcoins held by federal agencies should be transferred to the SBR within 7 days of the order’s issuance. It also declared Bitcoin as a reserve asset suitable for holding within the ESF, with acquisition programs to begin within two months. According to the acquisition program, about $21 billion in Bitcoin will be bought within a year using funds from the ESF. The purchases will happen under the watchful eyes of protocols to reduce mismanagement risks. Within a month, secure custody frameworks are expected to be implemented and this could include partnerships with secure service providers. Meanwhile, it will be up to the Treasury to create stringent standards to promote long-term security, including cryptographic verifications and less reliance on third parties. On sales from the SBR and transparency According to the draft, long-term preservation will be a priority, which means that any BTC the SBR buys will be locked down for at least two decades to protect the country’s financial strength. The documents say that Bitcoin sales can only happen under exceptional circumstances (e.g., economic or security crises). Asset liquidation will also require detailed justification and presidential approval. The draft also proposed that when the sales happen, they will be done with transparency and minimal disruption. There will be a public proof of reserve and cryptographic receipt of Bitcoin holdings will be published quarterly to promote transparency. The Treasury will be expected to provide reports on performance, security, and strategic benefits of Bitcoin within the ESF. Coordination between the various government agencies, including the Treasury, Federal Reserve and Department of Defense, among others will be encouraged in alignment with national security and economic policies. This draft has not been approved or signed, but many who have seen it seem to believe it is good enough. David Bailey, the CEO of Bitcoin Magazine, shared screenshots of the draft. He also endorsed the document and mentioned that the president’s signature is the only step needed to fully implement the Bitcoin reserve. The general sentiment among crypto stakeholders is that the draft is sufficient as a framework to integrate Bitcoin into America’s national reserves. If properly done, it could also boost the country’s security, long-term economic growth, and leadership in the crypto world.

The token was given out through an airdrop to current NFT holders, attracting interest in the crypto market. In the first hour of trading, according to data from CoinMarketCap , PENGU reached a trading volume of $90 million. Pudgy Penguins PENGU Token Popularity Soaring The airdrop gave 23.5% of PENGU’s total supply to holders of Pudgy Penguins NFTs. It also set aside 22% of the token’s supply for the Solana and Ethereum communities, strengthening its presence on multiple blockchains. To support easy trading, 12.3% of the total supply is reserved for decentralized exchanges. Meanwhile, the PENGU token trades at $0.03875, a 675% increase within 24 hours. PENGU’s successful launch has made Pudgy Penguins very popular, making it the second most valuable NFT collection after CryptoPunks. This launch highlights the growing trend of adding native tokens to existing NFT projects to create larger ecosystems and improve community engagement. PENGU Tokens Soars Following CoinMarketCap Listing Penguiana, the penguin-themed meme coin on the Solana blockchain, witnessed a 70% market valuation surge after CoinMarketCap’s June listing . This significant achievement underscores growing investor confidence. It also marked a pivotal advancement in Penguiana’s journey within the cryptocurrency landscape. $PENGU has broadened its accessibility through listings on prominent decentralized exchanges such as Raydium and Birdeye. These exchanges have facilitated the token’s swift uptake and trading. As Penguiana continues to evolve, the team remains focused on enlarging its ecosystem and deepening community engagement. Safety in the NFT Industry The NFT industry has witnessed significant growth and adoption in recent years. Some digital firms have also leveraged the platform to expand their offerings. For instance, Sony, a maker of gaming consoles, has filed a patent application to move NFTs between different games and platforms. However, with NFTs’ popularity, safety worries have surfaced, especially the safety of the platform used to produce, store, and trade NFTs. Recall that one Ethereum wallet suffered massive losses after selling 500 Moonbirds NFTs . Therefore, prioritizing safety in the NFT industry is critical to protecting users’ investments, preventing hacking or theft of valuable assets, and preserving the industry’s reputation.

If adopted, this move aims to position the United States as a global leader in digital assets. It highlights Bitcoin’s role as “digital gold” and seeks to drive capital inflows, technological adoption, and financial resilience. U.S. Proposes Strategic Bitcoin Reserve Under Trump to Strengthen Economy and Safeguard Dollar The proposal stresses the need for the U.S. to adapt to the growing influence of digital assets in global finance. Bitcoin is a decentralized, finite asset that can strengthen the U.S. economy and safeguard the dollar. The order aims to diversify the ESF’s holdings and secure long-term economic stability by formally designating Bitcoin as a strategic reserve asset. JUST IN: Bitcoin Policy Institute drafts Executive Order for a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve for President Trump pic.twitter.com/bxJHZKa8Ue — Bitcoin Magazine (@BitcoinMagazine) December 17, 2024 The executive order establishes a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve (SBR) to manage Bitcoin as a permanent national asset. The Treasury Secretary would administer it, and strict measures would ensure transparency and accountability. Regular audits, advanced security protocols, and comprehensive reporting would be required to build public confidence. The order calls for consolidating all Bitcoin currently under federal control. Within seven days, agencies like the U.S. Marshal Service would be required to stop selling, auctioning, or transferring Bitcoin. Once legal ownership is confirmed, those holdings would move to the Strategic Bitcoin Reserve. Additionally, the Treasury Secretary would have 60 days to implement an acquisition program to purchase and manage Bitcoin under the ESF. Trump’s Bitcoin Reserve Plan: Will Seized BTC Kickstart a New Financial Era? Bitcoin surged to a record high above $107,000 on Monday after President-elect Donald Trump reaffirmed plans to establish a U.S. bitcoin strategic reserve, igniting enthusiasm among crypto supporters. A strategic reserve is a stockpile of critical resources to stabilize markets during crises. Examples include the U.S. Strategic Petroleum Reserve and China’s reserves of metals and grains. Analysts are divided on whether Trump could create the reserve through an executive order or if Congress must act. Trump hinted the reserve could start with 200,000 seized bitcoins, currently worth around $21 billion. Adding more would require government purchases, potentially funded through debt issuance or selling gold reserves. Senator Cynthia Lummis has proposed legislation for the Treasury to purchase 200,000 BTC annually for five years , funded by Federal Reserve profits and gold holdings. Supporters argue a Bitcoin reserve could help dominate the global market, reduce deficits, and strengthen the U.S. dollar.

Qubetics Is the Best Crypto to Invest in 2024!,https://thecoinrise.com/cardano-left-you-behind-qubetics-is-the-best-crypto-to-invest-in-2024/,"The cryptocurrency market is filled with opportunities, but it’s also easy to miss out. Cardano, one of the most recognised names in crypto, delivered impressive growth for early investors. But if you’re still waiting for the next big thing, it’s time to turn your attention to Qubetics ($TICS) . With an affordable presale price and outstanding real-world applications, Qubetics is quickly becoming the best crypto to invest in 2024. Let’s dive into how Qubetics and Cardano compare and why Qubetics might be the best opportunity to watch this year. Qubetics ($TICS): A Practical Solution with Impressive Returns Qubetics is not just another cryptocurrency looking to make a splash. As the world’s first Web3 aggregator , Qubetics connects real-world businesses and individuals to blockchain technology through efficient, user-friendly solutions. At its core lies an innovative approach to solve global challenges, particularly in secure digital communications and decentralised transactions. Currently, Qubetics is in its 13th presale stage, with tokens priced at just $0.0342. So far, over 350 million tokens have been sold to more than 10,300 holders, raising $6.9 million. These numbers alone make Qubetics one of the best cryptos to invest in 2024, offering massive upside potential for early investors. If you invest $8,500 in Qubetics at $0.0342 per token, analysts predict significant gains. By the end of the presale, when $TICS reaches $0.25, your investment could grow by 630.19% ROI. If the token hits $1 post-presale, that translates to a 2,820.78% ROI. Should Qubetics reach $15 after its mainnet launch, your initial investment could rise to a jaw-dropping $3.7 million. One of Qubetics’ standout features is its decentralised VPN (dVPN). The dVPN ensures privacy and security in an age where digital surveillance is rampant. For professionals like doctors, lawyers, and entrepreneurs, Qubetics’ dVPN offers a private way to manage confidential transactions and sensitive data securely. For individuals, it means safer browsing, enhanced online privacy, and greater control over personal information. With growing concerns about cybersecurity, Qubetics’ dVPN has become a game-changer for both individuals and businesses. This unique blend of practical use cases and investor potential is why Qubetics has earned its place as the best crypto to invest in 2024. By solving real-world problems and bridging the gap between Web3 and traditional industries, Qubetics offers far more than just speculation. It’s a utility-driven investment for the future. Cardano (ADA): A Steady Leader in Blockchain Cardano is one of the most respected projects in the cryptocurrency space. Known for its academic approach to blockchain development, Cardano prioritises security, scalability, and sustainability. It has created a robust ecosystem designed to handle decentralised finance (DeFi), smart contracts, and real-world enterprise solutions. In 2024, Cardano continues to expand its ecosystem. The recent updates to its smart contract platform have improved efficiency and lowered transaction fees. With increased adoption of decentralised applications (dApps), Cardano has attracted developers and businesses seeking secure blockchain solutions. Despite its steady growth, Cardano’s price has remained relatively stable, with analysts predicting modest gains for 2024. While its ecosystem remains robust, its growth rate no longer matches the potential seen in emerging projects like Qubetics. Investors looking for exponential returns may find Qubetics’ presale more appealing than Cardano’s current market position. Conclusion: Qubetics is the Best Crypto to Invest in 2024 If you missed Cardano’s early success, now is your chance to seize a new opportunity. Qubetics ($TICS) is rapidly emerging as the best crypto to invest in 2024, offering affordable entry points, real-world applications like dVPN, and extraordinary ROI potential. With its 13th presale stage still ongoing and tokens priced at $0.0342, Qubetics combines practical blockchain solutions with an investment opportunity that could deliver life-changing returns. For investors seeking the next big winner, Qubetics delivers unmatched potential to outperform established projects like Cardano.

Recent market demand showed renewed spot open interest, as BTC grew to over $108,300, a new price record. Bitcoin (BTC) rallied to its most recent price record as market sentiment shifted to increased spot demand. Analysts noted since October, market influences depended on spot trading, rather than being driven by the derivative market. During earlier bull market stages, open interest on derivative positions was higher, while spot trading and flows to exchanges were slow. In the last quarter of 2024, the BTC Fund Flow Ratio increased its baseline, suggesting a higher inflow of funds to and from exchanges. The BTC fund flow ratio suggest spot exchange activity increased in the last quarter of 2024. | Source: Cryptoquant The fund flow ratio is a metric of on-chain BTC transfers against transfers to exchanges. A more active exchange flow means the focus shifted to spot trading. In the past quarter of 2024, both derivatives and spot trading accelerated. However, as the year comes to a close, spot activity is growing more dominant. Derivative open interest for BTC on major centralized exchanges stalled at around $33B, sinking slightly from its peak. The BTC derivative market goes through cycles of accumulation and liquidation of leveraged positions. Those cycles often boost the price to a new range, causing the liquidation of short positions. With time, interest shifts to additional accumulation on the spot market. Leveraged position accumulation and liquidation cycles are happening at lower levels, without causing significant drawdown events. At the same time, BTC traders often use the spot market to realize short-term gains and reaccumulate. The behavior of short-term trader whales also goes against retail sentiment. As BTC trades above $106,000, retail is bullish, while smart money has turned bearish. Overall, trading behavior shifted the Bitcoin fear and greed index to the ‘extreme greed’ level at 87 points. Demand for actual BTC reserves is rising Demand is rising for owning and controlling BTC in the form of long-term reserves. Instead of leveraged positions, bets on the value of BTC are made by storing coins that are instantly accessible. Demand for physical coins and spot trading led to an increase in the Coinbase premium index . The index has been in the green for most of the past 30-day period. The Coinbase premium index is showing higher demand for spot BTC buying on the US dollar market. The index measures BTC prices on Coinbase against the Binance market, suggesting increased demand for direct buying. Spot trading for BTC also expanded the share of US dollar trading. More than 21% of all BTC volumes are against the US dollar, diminishing the role of stablecoins. Despite the expansion of stablecoins, the dollar-based spot market indicates a shift to direct BTC demand. BTC keeps moving into whale wallets The other major sources for BTC holding are miners, who still own 1.9M coins. ETF buying is also ongoing, retaining even more coins through Coinbase Custody. The third biggest source of demand for BTC comes from corporate buyers, who are buying BTC through new bond issues. This source is also the biggest shift from fiat to crypto ownership, betting on long-term BTC growth. Demand from Bitcoin ETF absorbs most of the physical selling pressure. As older cohorts of holders realize profits, Bitcoin ETF absorbs up to 90% of that selling pressure. Even large-scale whales have easily found liquidity on the market. Demand from MicroStrategy, MARA Holdings, and other corporate buyers is also a significant drain on available coins. Demand far outpaces daily BTC production of just 450 new coins. The current conditions with actual transfers of coins to even larger whale wallets are expected to create a supply crunch. Based on the Rainbow chart , BTC is still in the accumulation zone and possibly far from the cycle top. The next potential levels see BTC test $110,000 and a peak above $125,000.

Salesforce plans to hire 2,000 new salespeople to focus on selling artificial intelligence (AI) products as the company planning to expand its AI offerings. Salesforce to Hire 2,000 Salespeople for AI Expansion CEO Marc Benioff made this announcement during a company event in San Francisco on Tuesday, saying that the demand for AI tools is so high that the company is increasing its hiring plans. “We’re adding another couple of thousand salespeople to help sell these products,” Benioff said. “ We already had 9,000 referrals for the 2,000 positions we’ve opened. It’s amazing.” This announcement makes a big increase from the initial plan. A month ago, Benioff mentioned that Salesforce would hire 1,000 new salespeople for AI roles. The company is now doubling the count as it prepares to release its new AI agent software in February 2025. Salesforce aims to make AI a key part of its product lineup, with AI tools to help sales teams, marketers, and customer service agents do their jobs more efficiently. The new salespeople will help introduce and sell Salesforce’s latest AI technology, including the upcoming second version of its Agentforce platform. This software is designed to create AI-powered agents to handle complex tasks, like answering questions in Salesforce’s Slack app using all available data. The new AI agents will be able to respond to customer queries, making business operations smoother and faster. Benioff is very excited about Salesforce’s potential for AI. In a recent interview, he shared, “I’ve never been more excited about anything at Salesforce, maybe in my career.” He added that he expects the company to have over a billion AI agents within the next year. “This is the most exciting thing that’s happened to Salesforce,” he said. Salesforce’s AI Push Following 2022 Layoffs Salesforce’s move into AI comes after the company laid off over 7,000 employees in 2022. Cutting over 7,000 jobs to adjust to changing economic conditions. As of January 2024, Salesforce had 72,682 employees. Now, the company is focused on hiring more people to increase growth in the AI space. With its new AI agents and expanded sales team, Salesforce is aiming to become a major player in the AI industry.

Coinbase asked a U.S. court to deny BiT Global’s lawsuit in Northern California, which seeks $1 billion in relief and a temporary restraining order on wrapped Bitcoin’s ( wBTC )’s delisting. The Justin Sun-affiliated BiT Global sued Coinbase on Dec. 13 for planning to remove the wrapped Bitcoin ( BTC ) asset from its U.S.-based exchange. BiT Global claimed delisting wBTC was illegal, would cause irreparable harm to the token’s economics, and was unjustified as Coinbase listed unserious cryptocurrencies like meme coins. Also, launching cbBTC breached antitrust laws and threatened to create a Coinbase-controlled monopoly in the tokenized Bitcoin marketplace. The crypto exchange argued that California’s Unfair Competition Law was inapplicable. DefiLlama confirmed that cbBTC ranked outside the top 10 tokenized BTC assets by market capitalization. Coinbase has the right to choose whom to do business with, and no law requires it to allow bad actors or suspected bad actors onto its exchange… Coinbase does not have anything approaching monopoly power, and because its decision to delist wBTC was proper and justified based on the careful review it undertook and the unacceptable risk of doing business with an entity associated with Mr. Sun. Coinbase response to BiT Global lawsuit According to the December 17 court filing, material changes to wBTC’s stewardship, particularly Justin Sun’s majority control of the Bitcoin reserves, prompted Coinbase and other entities to reconsider their support for the asset. You might also like: Sky mulls cutting support for wBTC over Justin Sun affiliations The Securities and Exchange Commission charged Sun and three of his wholly owned companies with federal violations. Additionally, the FBI reportedly opened an inquiry regarding potential terror financing involving Sun. The U.S. Department of Justice has not indicted Sun by publishing time, neither have authorities issued any arrest warrants for the Tron ( TRX ) founder. Coinbase stated that its new wBTC risk assessments, in line with company listing standards, raised red flags, primarily due to Sun’s involvement. The exchange described its decision as “common sense” and necessary to protect its customers. The company also emphasized that delisting wBTC would not impact the token’s overall on-chain activity, which largely takes place on other platforms. Nor can BiT claim harm, let alone irreparable harm, from being delisted from an exchange where less than 1% of transactions involving wBTC are made. Perhaps that is why BiT sat on its claims for nearly a month before filing suit, belying any urgency for relief. The U.S. crypto titan asked the California Court to rule against BiT Global’s TRO request and $1 billion relief package, due to the firm’s ties to an allegedly indictable individual and fabricated emergency regarding wBTC. We've filed our response to BiT Global’s effort to stop our delisting of wBTC before any discovery or even formal response to their bogus claims. We lay out why this lawsuit lacks any semblance of merit and why their request for a TRO should be denied.

Japan is famous for its strict regulation of both the crypto and gaming sectors. Critics, however, say that a “lack of clarity regarding legal regulations, accounting, and taxation issues” have thus far held Japanese firms back from developing blockchain gaming titles.

A French magistrate and member of the Cour des Comptes, Knafo’s background includes public service and political advising, most notably for right-wing Jewish presidential candidate Éric Zemmour. Knafo’s public role has steadily risen since her election to the European Parliament in 2024. Why The EU Needs A Strategic Bitcoin Reserve In her speech on the Parliament floor, Knafo drew upon global examples—citing El Salvador’s early adoption of Bitcoin and political figures such as former US President Donald Trump and Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell—to underscore a rising wave of institutional acceptance. She asserted that the EU’s current financial strategies put member states at a disadvantage within what she characterized as a rapidly evolving monetary landscape. “Already 3 years ago, on the other side of the Atlantic, the president of El Salvador decided to invest for his country in crypto-currencies,” said Knafo, referencing El Salvador’s 2021 legal tender law. “At the time, he was reviled by the political class and the IMF. Today, he’s up 100%.” Emphasizing a perceived missed opportunity for EU nations, Knafo argued that El Salvador’s move has yielded significant capital gains—resources that, she said, the country has used to bolster both “the security and sovereignty of his country.” Turning to the United States, she acknowledged that “Donald Trump will establish a strategic Bitcoin reserve for the United States.”. Knafo also invoked the public stance of Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell , stating that “Jerome Powell is now talking about it as ‘digital gold.’” She positioned these developments as signs that other major economies are adapting to decentralized finance, while “the European Union […] continues to accumulate tragically inflationary deficits,” with existing regulatory measures that she criticized as overly restrictive. “We don’t want this dystopian world,” Knafo warned, referencing the European Central Bank’s work on a digital euro . “Where tomorrow a European bureaucrat will be able to prohibit us from certain transactions and even eliminate us from the banking system at the click of a button for something we say on social networks.” Throughout her address, Knafo appealed for a wholesale shift in EU financial policy: “It’s time to say no to the totalitarian temptations of the European Central Bank, which wants to impose a digital euro entirely in its own hands […] It’s time to bet on freedom.” She went on to advocate for a flourishing Bitcoin mining sector in the EU, suggesting that France’s nuclear energy infrastructure could supply a competitive edge. “We, the French, hold the cards with our nuclear trump card,” she said, framing domestic power generation as an untapped enabler of large-scale mining operations. Knafo also addressed the need to adjust current taxation policies, urging lawmakers to “stop taxing cryptocurrency holders” and stressing that crypto-asset holders took personal risks to generate their wealth. She characterized existing government deficits as directly fueling inflation and economic instability: “Government deficits that drive money creation […] create inflation, that lead to chaos […] Let them protect themselves from the insane spiral you’ve created.” At press time, Bitcoin traded at $106,947.",Bitcoin News|bitcoin|bitcoin news|bitcoin price|btc|BTC news|btc price|Sarah Knafo|Strategic Bitcoin Reserve|Strategic Bitcoin Reserve EU,EN,0,0,AAVE|ADA|ALTCOIN|ASIA|BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|BUSINESS|COMMODITY|DOGE|DOT|ETH|EXCHANGE|FIAT|LINK|LTC|LUNA|MARKET|MATIC|MINING|REGULATION|SHIB|SOL|SPONSORED|TECHNOLOGY|TRADING|TRX|UNI|USDT|WALLET|XMR|XRP|ZEC|ZRX|OTHER|RESEARCH|ARB|BITTENSOR|BNB|CRO|WIF|HBAR|ICP|IMX|INJ|NEAR|PEPE|SUI|TON|USDC|FLOKI|ONDO|BONK|SEI|JUP|BSV|WLD|APE|HNT|FTT|BTG|MOG|PYUSD|MEME|RAY|ARKM|MX|AIRDROP|TOKEN SALE|FORKS|TOKEN LISTING AND DELISTING,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2024-12-17 23:30:31

Can the Shiba Inu Price Recover? The Shiba Inu price is currently just over 20% down from its recent highs and these losses could extend in the short term. That said, risks remain tilted towards a renewed meme coin pump at any point before the end of the year, or in early 2025. Sentiment remains bullish ahead of the arrival of the Trump administration in the White House in January. A Bitcoin strategic reserve , which seems more and more likely every day right now, could send BTC to the moon. And that could mean rotation into altcoins , including major meme coins. All the while, the incoming Department of Government Efficiency (D.O.G.E.) will keep Dogecoin (DOGE) and the broader meme coin market in focus.

How High Will Shiba Inu Go? Assuming the Shiba Inu price hits new highs for the year soon, it could soon challenge its record highs in the $0.000090 area soon. Beyond that, a parabolic rally could be in store. A rally towards the 3.618 or 4.236 Fibonacci extension from the 2023 lows back to the 2021 highs suggests gains of as much as 10x from current levels are very possible. That would see Shiba Inu attain a market cap of over $150 billion. That may seem ridiculous, but if Bitcoin hits $200,000, that would see its market cap exceed $4 trillion. In this scenario, SHIB’s market cap would only amount to about 4% of Bitcoin’s, which is to unbelievable when considering its position as a leading meme coin in the market. The near-term future looks very bright for the meme coin space and Shiba Inu, though, as ever, these are incredibly volatile markets. In order to reap big gains, investors also need to be able to HODL through rapid and aggressive downturns.

Metaplanet Inc., often referred to as the “Japanese MicroStrategy,” has announced the issuance of ¥4.5 billion (approximately $30 million) in zero-interest bonds to fund its Bitcoin acquisition strategy. The firm is positioning itself as Asia’s largest corporate Bitcoin holder. The announcement marks Metaplanet’s fourth series of bonds, with a maturity date set for June 16, 2025. The zero-interest bonds will be released in tranches which will allow the company to raise funds for Bitcoin purchases. Metaplanet plans to redeem these bonds through the previously issued warrants, according to reports. Metaplanet’s strategic Bitcoin acquisition plan Since April 2024, Metaplanet has made Bitcoin its treasury reserve asset and has already acquired over 1,150 BTC, worth about $122.67 million. This approach is similar to MicroStrategy’s Bitcoin reserve. Metaplanet’s new bond issuance is to speed up its Bitcoin buying strategy specifically to purchase more Bitcoin. By issuing zero-interest bonds, Metaplanet avoids short-term financial stress while using the funds to grow its assets. Investors benefit because these bonds are sold at a discount but pay the full value at maturity. The bond issuance news resulted in a 51% surge in Metaplanet’s stock price over the past five trading sessions. Shares reached an all-time high of 4,270 JPY, increasing the company’s market capitalization beyond the $1 billion mark. Over 27.8 billion yen (~$180 million) worth of Metaplanet shares was traded, showing the company’s ability to capitalize on its Bitcoin-centric approach. Even Simon Gerovich, CEO of Metaplanet, acknowledged the market’s overwhelming response. Metaplanet plans to issue additional private placement bonds worth up to ¥5 billion to expand its Bitcoin reserves. These bonds are to be issued in partnership with EVO FUND. The proceeds from the bond issuances will also be allocated exclusively for Bitcoin purchases, reinforcing Metaplanet’s long-term vision. Shareholder rewards program in Bitcoin In addition to its bold investment moves, the company also announced a Bitcoin rewards program. The company announced a 30-million-yen ($199,500) prize pool, which will reward shareholders who own at least 100 shares as of December 31, 2024. Through a lottery system, 2,350 selected shareholders will receive varying amounts of Bitcoin. Metaplanet issued ¥4.5 billion in zero-interest bonds to increase its Bitcoin holdings, strengthening its position as Asia’s largest corporate Bitcoin holder.

Santa Rides Shiba (SANTSHIB), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 19,000% in price in the coming days. This is because SANTSHIB is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Santa Rides Shiba can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Santa Rides Shiba could become the next viral memecoin. Santa Rides Shiba launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Santa Rides Shiba on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Santa Rides Shiba by entering its contract address – CxpeR8vdgeVWZFwBytS7PRrXHBwVgPJWZBJUcpK3k7vT – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum.

Analysts speculate that this critical support level will be a bounce-off point for the Dogecoin price to reach $4 . However, in the shadow of the Dogecoin price’s hype, many top investors are putting their money into a new altcoin, WallitIQ (WLTQ) . Why? This AI altcoin, in the second presale stage, is priced at just $0.0243 and has the potential to outpace Dogecoin in reaching the $4 price milestone.

37776413,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=663540,1734480059,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/newsbtc.png,Analyst Who Correctly Predicted The Fantom Breakout Above $1 Reveals What’s Next In The Parabolic Trend,https://www.newsbtc.com/news/fantom/fantom-breakout-above-1-trend/,"A crypto analyst on TradingView, known as ‘Tradecitypro,’ has published a detailed Fantom (FTM) report, breaking down the cryptocurrency’s price action across the daily and 4-hour timeframe. After accurately predicting Fantom‘s surge above $1, the analyst highlights key price levels, market trends, potential price movements, and bullish technical indicators for FTM’s next parabolic trend. Fantom Daily Timeframe: Signs Of Trend Weakness After correctly forecasting FTM’s price breakout at $0.84, the TradingView analyst has revealed that the cryptocurrency is now following a parabolic uptrend, supported by a curved ascending trendline. According to the analyst, Fantom’s price has reacted multiple times to this distinctive trendline, ending price corrections and resuming its upward momentum. During the last bullish surge during Fantom’s uptrend, the cryptocurrency broke past the 0.7707 resistance and rose to the weekly resistance zone at 1.1116, where it stabilized above that level. Moreover, several indicators suggest that FTM may be slowing down and losing momentum. Its candle sizes have been gradually shrinking, indicating reduced bullish activity. Additionally, price corrections have intensified, signaling increased selling pressures and potential profit-taking. Fantom’s trading volume has also declined, suggesting that traders’ interests might shift. Another technical indicator that is currently bearish is the Relative Strength Index (RSI), which is showing signs of divergence, signaling a potential reversal of the price of FTM drops below 55.74 on the RSI. Looking ahead, the TradingView analyst has revealed that a notable sign of sharp bullish trends and pre-pump movements is when a cryptocurrency exhibits weakness and a potential for a price reversal. If the current bearish trend for Fantom continues, the analyst has set the first minor resistance level at 1.6218. Additionally, if FTM can maintain a stable price above this zone, its next and strongest resistance could be at 3.2506. This resistance zone is near FTM’s all-time high of $3.46, representing a significant supply region. On the other hand, if FTM experiences a price correction, it would likely drop to the first support at the curved trendline. If the trendline is broken, the next price levels to watch are 1.1116 and 0.7707. A sustained price decline below 0.7707 would invalidate the previous bullish scenario for Fantom, potentially pushing the price further down to between 0.5349 and 0.2928. 4-Hour Timeframe: Ascending Channel And Potential Breakouts In the 4-hour timeframe, the TradingView analyst revealed that Fantom is currently moving within an Ascending Channel. The cryptocurrency’s price is interacting with the midline of the channel, providing temporary support. The analyst has revealed that no significant moves will be expected if Fantom remains within this Ascending channel. However, if the cryptocurrency can break out, it could lead to two potential scenarios: the start of a new parabolic trend or a trend exhaustion due to a loss in bullish momentum. The TradingView analyst has identified the price level at 1.636 as Fantom’s next static resistance. However, if FTM’s price has not yet reached this zone, the analyst suggests a safer strategy of taking long positions based on Dow Theory and channel breakouts.

Feels good, right? Well, the market’s buzzing with three coins that might just get you there. BTFD Coin (BTFD) is shaking up the scene with its massive presale momentum, Play-to-Earn (P2E) game, and unbeatable community vibe. At the same time, Brett (BRETT) and COQ Inu (COQ) are making waves in the meme coin world with explosive gains and strong blockchain integration. If you’re scouting the best meme coins to buy for 2025, you’ve landed at the right spot. Let’s break down what makes these three coins worth watching, with a laser focus on BTFD Coin, the presale powerhouse currently turning heads across the crypto space. BTFD Coin (BTFD): A Presale Powerhouse You Don’t Want to Miss BTFD Coin is not just a meme; it’s a movement. Launched with the ethos of “Buy The F**ing Dip,”* BTFD has turned the legendary investment mantra into a full-blown ecosystem that rewards early movers. Since the presale kicked off at just $0.000004 per coin, it’s been nothing but up. Now in Stage 12, the price has hit $0.00013, with the coin set to list at $0.0006 at the end of the presale. Here’s the jaw-dropper: BTFD has raised over $4.1 million, with more than 56 billion coins sold and 5,700+ holders already on board. That’s what you call momentum. If you’re wondering, “How much could I earn?”, let’s do the maths. Say you invest $1,000 right now in Stage 12. At $0.00013 per coin, you’ll bag a staggering 7.69 million BTFD coins. When the presale ends and the price hits $0.0006, your $1,000 investment could balloon to $4,615. And that’s just the start. But BTFD isn’t just about hype. The project has actual substance with its Beta P2E game now live. You can join the Bulls Squad, tackle levels, and get a taste of what’s to come. Rewards aren’t live in the Beta yet, but this sneak peek is proof that BTFD is building something solid. Add to that staking rewards with an average 90% APY and it’s clear why investors are loading up their bags. Oh, and did I mention the BTFD Coin Referral Program? Share your referral code and earn 10% of the raise amount in BTFD tokens if you make the top 20 leaderboard. Your friends get an extra 10% BTFD when they spend $50 or more. Everybody wins. With Ethereum as its backbone and liquidity locked for three years, BTFD isn’t messing around. This isn’t just a meme coin; it’s a full-on ecosystem, primed for 2025’s bull run. If you’ve been hunting for the best meme coins to buy for 2025, don’t miss this dip. BTFD is your golden ticket. Brett (BRETT): The Rising Star on Base Chain Let’s talk about Brett (BRETT), a meme coin that’s captured hearts and wallets alike. Inspired by its Base Chain integration, Brett has proven that it’s more than just a flash in the pan. Trading at $0.1749 with a market cap of $1.8 billion, Brett’s price has doubled since November 2024, showing strong momentum in the competitive meme coin space. What’s driving this growth? A combination of strategic exchange listings and solid community support. Major exchanges have opened their doors to Brett, bringing more liquidity and visibility to the project. There’s also mounting speculation that Brett might score listings on Binance and Coinbase, which would catapult its popularity even further. Despite the high volatility (par for the course with meme coins), Brett’s trajectory is hard to ignore. Its recent performance and integration with Base Chain make it a strong contender among the best meme coins to buy for 2025. Whether it’s the next Pepe or something even bigger remains to be seen, but Brett has certainly earned its spot on this list. COQ Inu (COQ): Avalanche’s Meme Coin King Over on the Avalanche blockchain, COQ Inu (COQ) is quietly stealing the show. Priced at $0.000002373 with a market cap of $162 million, COQ Inu has firmly established itself as Avalanche’s top meme coin. Boasting a 24-hour trading volume of $20.44 million, it’s clear that COQ Inu isn’t just a niche project—it’s a growing phenomenon. COQ Inu’s secret sauce lies in its transparency and tokenomics. The team has burned liquidity and renounced contracts, ensuring the community’s trust in the project. Combine that with Avalanche’s low fees and lightning-fast transactions, and COQ Inu offers a compelling alternative to Ethereum-based meme coins. Market sentiment has been a major driver here. COQ Inu’s recent recognition among high-ROI meme coins has attracted investors seeking the next big win. With its unique position in the Avalanche ecosystem and its commitment to decentralisation, COQ Inu is certainly one of the best meme coins to buy for 2025 if you’re looking to diversify beyond Ethereum. Final Thoughts: Don’t Miss Out on BTFD Coin’s Presale With 2025 just around the corner, the race to snag the best meme coins to buy for 2025 is heating up. BTFD Coin (BTFD) stands out as the clear front-runner, with its explosive presale success, P2E game, and community-driven vision. Raising over $4.1 million and counting, BTFD is shaping up to be the ultimate early-mover opportunity for investors ready to ride the bull run. At the same time, Brett (BRETT) is surging ahead on Base Chain, and COQ Inu (COQ) continues to dominate Avalanche with its transparent, low-fee model. Each of these projects offers something unique, but if you’re after a game-changing investment, BTFD Coin deserves your attention. Don’t let this opportunity pass you by. Join the BTFD presale now, stack your bags, and prepare to ride the bull into 2025. Timing is everything—and this is your moment to buy the f***ing dip.

Tether has invested strategically in StablR, a European startup focused on euro-denominated stablecoins. This partnership is to increase the use of stablecoins across Europe, especially with the European Union’s new regulations on digital assets set to take effect in 2024. Why Is This Investment Important? Stablecoins are digital currencies pegged to real-world assets like the US dollar or euro. They offer stability and making them less volatile than other cryptocurrencies. Tether’s investment in StablR is the sign of company’s commitment to promoting stablecoins in Europe, particularly as the region prepares for the upcoming Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA) regulation, which will regulate cryptocurrencies and stablecoins in the EU. StablR, which has already received a license in Malta to issue MiCA-compliant stablecoins and will use Tether’s tokenization platform, Hadron , to facilitate the conversion of traditional assets into digital tokens. By converting it will allow businesses to create digital versions of stocks, bonds, commodities, and more while complying with legal regulations on the whole. StablR’s Role and the Future of Stablecoins StablR offers two types of stablecoins: EURR , which is pegged to the euro, and USDR , which is pegged to the US dollar. Both stablecoins are available on popular blockchain networks like ERC-20 and Solana , and transactions on different platforms. With the help of Tether’s platform, StablR plans to expand its offerings and make stablecoins available on more blockchain networks, allowing even more people and businesses to use them. The stablecoin market is growing especially in countries with unstable economies, Europe is also showing increased interest, with many looking for alternatives to traditional banking systems. Tether’s investment in StablR comes as crypto exchanges adapt to new regulations in Europe (MiCA) that require stablecoin issuers to meet strict compliance and transparency standards. Tether’s investment in StablR helps bring stablecoins like EURR and USDR into Europe’s financial system. With Tether’s support, this partnership makes stablecoins easier to use and ensures they follow the rules in digital currencies.

Related Reading: The $589 XRP Dream: Believers Aren’t ‘Delusional’ Enough, Expert Says The study indicates that in the third quarter of 2024 Solana’s ecosystem funding reached $173 million, the highest level since mid-2022. This money flow shows a strong conviction in Solana’s ability to be the top blockchain platform. Solana: Key Drivers Of Growth One of the key reasons for this positive prognosis is the upcoming introduction of a spot SOL Exchange-Traded Fund (ETF). As regulatory conditions improve, experts predict that institutional investors will flock to Solana, increasing its market position. We are so back!

Jump into the full report now ⬇️ pic.twitter.com/AzOZhiAib5 — Messari (@MessariCrypto) December 16, 2024 The introduction of a spot ETF might result in considerable financial inflows, placing Solana as a viable competitor to other cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin and Ethereum. Moreover, ongoing improvements to Solana’s infrastructure are anticipated to augment its performance. Jump Trading’s Firedancer client pledges to enhance transaction velocities and network scalability. The preliminary implementation has commenced, with complete deployment anticipated in 2025. This enhancement will broaden client alternatives while bolstering network security by reducing dependence on a singular codebase. Institutional Interest And Market Sentiment Reflecting the increasing institutional interest in Solana, companies like VanEck and Bitwise have lately registered for a spot SOL ETF. This action points to Solana’s unique value proposition as a high-performance blockchain starting to be acknowledged by conventional finance. If this tendency keeps up, many predict SOL’s price would soar to new heights; some even project it may hit $4,000. Solana’s market attitude remains positive, particularly after it just went past the $220 price level. If the movement continues, analysts anticipate SOL will reach its previous all-time high of $263. The combination of increased capital, technological breakthroughs and institutional support fosters Solana’s expansion.

In a new video update, Guy Turner, the host of CoinBureau, tells his 2.57 million YouTube subscribers that the market cap for Pyth Network ( PYTH ) may eventually soar due to its potential to generate massive fee revenue. “In my opinion, Pyth Network is one of the most underrated cryptos there is. That’s because it’s an oracle that provides high-frequency data feeds that blockchains like Solana depend on. In other words, Pyth Network is like Chainlink, and some would argue that it’s better than Chainlink. That’s because Pyth Network technically has its own blockchain called Pyth Net, which could theoretically leverage the PYTH token for fees someday. This could make PYTH bigger than LINK, which is already pretty darn big. For the time being, though, PYTH continues to fly under the radar, which is good news for those looking to get in early, but bad news for those who have already been accumulating for a while.” PYTH is trading for $0.49 at time of writing, up 7% in the last 24 hours. With a market cap of $1.79 billion, PYTH is the 83rd largest crypto project. Meanwhile, LINK is trading for $29.08 at time of writing, up slightly on the day. With a market cap of $18.21 billion, LINK is the 13th largest crypto project.
