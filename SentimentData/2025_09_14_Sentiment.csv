This surge in activity is a welcome change of pace after a slowdown earlier in the year due to market volatility influenced by Trump’s tariff policies. The week’s success is also proof of renewed investor appetite for tech, fintech, and crypto-related listings. Klarna, Figure, and Gemini led the charge Some of the notable IPOs involved Klarna, Figure , Gemini, Legence, Black Rock Coffee Bar, and Via Transportation. Among the newcomers are significant players in various sectors, showcasing a diverse range of industries entering the public market. The lineup was much broader than expected, spanning industries and testing the waters for a potential fall IPO boom. Among the six IPOs, five were worth at least $290 million, priced above their marketed ranges. However, their performances post-listing have not been as positive. Nevertheless, Wall Street analysts have called this a sign of healthy skepticism among investors, which they say bodes well for the market going forward. Klarna has since inched toward its offering price, while Figure Technology Solutions Inc. ended its second day of trading near a high hit in the opening minutes of its debut. Among the four listings from Friday, Gemini Space Station Inc. has soared, while Blackstone-backed Legence Corp. and Via Transportation Inc. have been left with at best modest gains after opening below their IPO prices. This week’s set of deals is being considered as a gauge for how active the stock market is getting, and the results are mixed. All the IPOs witnessed strong demand in the formal marketing process before trading began, with many selling bigger stakes than they had initially offered. Despite rough starts, analysts claim things have been smooth compared to ailing deals from earlier this year that continue to struggle underwater. Experts expect the relative calm to entice more companies to go public, even though investors are still somewhat choosy over valuations and earnings. “Investor expectations remain high and continue to be demanding — profitability and fundamentals are huge,” said Mike Bellin, who leads PricewaterhouseCoopers’ IPO practice. “Some companies were very conservative with their prices because we’re still in an uncertain market.” Next week is expected to be equally active as Stubhub Holdings Inc., Netskope Inc., and others plan to go public. The group could raise up to $2.53 billion combined, and that would mark the first back-to-back weeks of such volumes in US IPOs that do not include SPACs, REITs, and closed-end funds since December 2021. The week’s activity is not permanent, analysts warn The US IPO market has had a strong start this month, but even with the welcome activity, the IPO market is still in recovery compared to pre-pandemic levels. There are those who don’t see the renewed activity as permanent either. Kati Penney, the corporate transactions lead at CrossCountry Consulting, is one of those who expect the market to dial back. She has tagged the week’s activity as an “anomaly” that can be linked to a return of large, well-known names whose processes were paused due to market volatility related to President Donald Trump’s chaotic tariff policies in April. The chaos kept several late-stage startups sidelined for months as investor demand for new deals soured. “We’ll see steady momentum but not at the pace of these past two weeks,” Penney said in an interview. “It also seems to be a bit more concentrated in some of these industries around technology — crypto, AI.” That was confirmed in the past week as the week’s largest deals came from Klarna and Figure, where both had investor orders for roughly 25 times more stock than was sold, according to Bloomberg News .

But when it comes to 2025, the quest for turning $100 into $1,000 is still to be fulfilled. Can the established meme coins like PEPE, Bonk Coin, and Shiba Inu, with their life changing history backing them, be the $1,000 contenders? But something is stirring the market: Layer Brett ($LBRETT) and its presale . Can it convert your $100 into $1,000? Layer Brett: Can its Presale make 10x your $100? Layer 2 isn’t slowing down — it’s gearing up to dominate, with estimates showing more than ten trillion dollars flowing through it annually by 2027. The push comes from a simple truth: crypto users want speed, affordability, and scale. Layer Brett isn’t here to play safe. It takes the raw power of Layer 2 infrastructure and fuses it with the chaos of meme culture. The result? Blazing-fast transactions, fees so tiny they barely register, and a staking system built to reward the bold. Early entrants can secure more than a staggering 700% APY. But the longer you wait, the smaller the payout — and the bigger the FOMO. With $LBRETT presale priced at just $0.0055 , this is the type of setup that latecomers will only dream about. Combine instant staking, a one million dollar prize pool, and true decentralization, and you’re looking at a project that experts say can convert your $100 to $1,000 before the next year. PEPE: A Meme’s Technical Takeover PEPE’s future looks very bright. The technical charts show a significant “golden cross” on its moving averages, which is supported by a clear breakout from a long-term trading range. This strong technical setup, combined with renewed interest from investors, means PEPE has the potential for a massive rally. A $100 investment in PEPE could reasonably see a 3x to 6x return, turning into $300 to $600. BONK’s Big Bark BONK is set for a major price jump this year. The charts show a powerful MAs golden cross, and it broke out of a long-term pattern. A $100 BONK investment could grow significantly. Some experts believe it could be $300 by the end of 2025. SHIB’s Next Leg Up SHIB is also poised for a significant rally through the end of 2025. A clear golden cross signals a major upward trend. This move is supported by a bullish flag pattern, with SHIB taking a short rest before a big jump. Some analysts predict a price increase of 3x to 4x, making your $100 become $300-$400. Best bet to make $1,000 PEPE, Bonk Coin, and Shiba Inu are all meme coins, and their hyped nature means that they can (and do) rise faster than the rest of the market. But 2 facts impact their predicted gains: First, all three meme coins have substantial market caps, making big gains difficult, if possible. Secondly, they are pure hypes, and everyone knows that meme coins, where they can rise, can also crash hard. Layer Brett ($LBRETT), however, has a small market cap and merges DeFi with meme coins, giving it a purpose that neither PEPE, Bonk Coin, nor SHIB has. If you want to convert your $100 into $1,000, Layer Brett is your best bet. The presale is on , and you can only make $1,000 if you join now.

51674128,https://invezz.com/?p=2880487,1757793600,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/69/default.png,"Solana ETF delayed again, but analysts highlight SOL and this hidden gem",https://invezz.com/news/2025/09/13/solana-etf-delayed-again-but-analysts-highlight-sol-and-this-hidden-gem/,"The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has once again delayed its decision on spot Solana ETFs, frustrating traders who had hoped for quicker progress. While many expected approval in September, the regulator has pushed the deadline further, citing the need for “additional review.” This move mirrors the repeated delays faced by Ethereum and XRP ETFs, signaling that the SEC is still cautious about giving green lights to altcoins beyond Bitcoin. Despite the regulatory setbacks, Solana’s market performance has remained strong. Trading near $225, SOL has held its ground, buoyed by consistent on-chain activity and continued developer adoption. Investors seem less concerned about the short-term delays and more focused on Solana’s longer-term trajectory as one of the most scalable Layer-1 blockchains in the industry. Amid this environment, retail traders are not only eyeing Solana but also looking at presales like MAGACOIN FINANCE, which offer early exposure and high-growth potential before broader exchange listings. Solana’s strength amid regulatory uncertainty Even without ETF approval, Solana has shown impressive resilience. Daily active addresses remain high, DeFi activity on the network continues to climb, and transaction speeds maintain their edge over most competitors. Solana’s ability to weather negative headlines reflects the growing maturity of its ecosystem. Whales appear to agree. On-chain trackers reveal that large wallets have been quietly accumulating SOL, viewing the delays as temporary rather than a deal-breaker. This steady accumulation has helped keep Solana above key support levels, giving confidence to retail investors watching from the sidelines. MAGACOIN FINANCE in the spotlight before listings Limited allocations left – MAGACOIN FINANCE’s current presale tier nearly oversubscribed. Analysts argue this is one of the strongest indicators of retail demand in the presale market. The project’s rapid growth reflects both strong community engagement and institutional-style interest, as whales have started participating in recent weeks. The appeal of MAGACOIN FINANCE lies in its positioning as a hybrid: it captures the viral momentum typical of meme coins while pairing it with a structured roadmap, audited contracts, and real ecosystem goals. For traders wary of regulatory delays on major tokens like Solana, MAGACOIN FINANCE offers an alternative – a ground-floor opportunity before mainstream exposure. Technical analysis for SOL On the charts, Solana has strong support near $200, with additional layers around $180. Resistance sits at $250, followed by $290. A breakout above $250 could accelerate momentum, opening the door to $290 as the next target. Conversely, failure to hold above $200 may trigger a pullback to $180 or even lower. Momentum indicators remain supportive, with RSI readings showing that SOL is not yet overbought. Trading volumes have held steady, further reinforcing confidence in the asset’s stability despite ETF delays. Institutional outlook While the SEC has postponed decisions, analysts point out that institutional interest in Solana is real. Asset managers view SOL as one of the most compelling alternatives to Ethereum for scaling, DeFi, and consumer-facing apps. Once ETF approval eventually arrives, the potential for significant inflows remains high. For now, traders see the delays as opportunities to accumulate before a longer-term breakout. Broader market trends Bitcoin’s stability above $114,000 and Ethereum’s consolidation have created a supportive backdrop for altcoins. The “altseason index” has been rising steadily, indicating that traders are rotating capital into alternative Layer-1 tokens. Solana, Cardano, and emerging presales like MAGACOIN FINANCE are among the biggest beneficiaries of this trend. Global macroeconomic conditions also support the case for risk assets. With the Federal Reserve expected to cut rates this month, liquidity is increasing across markets, which typically benefits both equities and crypto. Conclusion Solana’s latest ETF delay may frustrate traders, but it hasn’t derailed the network’s momentum. With strong on-chain activity, steady whale accumulation, and a resilient price above $200, SOL remains one of the top altcoins to watch heading into October. At the same time, presale projects like MAGACOIN FINANCE are capturing unprecedented demand, with its current tier nearly oversubscribed. Together, SOL and MAGACOIN FINANCE showcase two sides of the altcoin opportunity: one established, the other emerging, both with high potential as the bull market unfolds.

Mutuum Finance stands at Stage 6 of presale and has set the token at $0.035. Stage 7 is a 14.29% increase to $0.04. The campaign has reached more than $15.63 million and more than 16,240+ investors have invested to date. Given SHIB has had a strong community presence, institutional investors are closely monitoring the momentum of MUTM as a vehicle to ride the next crypto bull run. Shiba Inu (SHIB) Status Update SHIB trades at $0.00001317 as of now. Shiba Inu has been trending sideways in recent times, its price fluctuating between $0.0000129 and $0.0000132, showing marginal gains but also points of resistance. While developments in the ecosystem like Shibarium and token burns remain in the cards, overall momentum remains cautious, and whales and investors await better clues. While SHIB remains on this stage, new DeFi-projects like Mutuum Finance are starting to garner investor interest. Official Bug Bounty Program Mutuum Finance and CertiK have established an official Bug Bounty Program with the $50,000 USDT bounty for white-hat hackers to help discover bugs in the project codebase. The program focuses on potential issues on four levels of severity: critical, major, minor, and low. Its objectives are to enhance security, protect investors, and protect users on the platform. Interest and Liquidity Models The project utilizes a dynamic interest rate model to keep the liquidity of the platform in equilibrium. Low interest rates cause individuals to borrow more if money borrowed is in high demand. Individuals will pay a premium and introduce more funds into the system if interest levels are low. Fixed interest rates can also be applied to borrowing, which is larger than floating but re-negotiable every time there are fluctuations in the conditions of the market. Fixed interest rates are only utilized in highly liquid assets. Mutuum Finance is decentralized and MUTM holders are in control. Borrowers have freedom, and system interest rate design ensures long-term sustainability and efficiency. The design also allows for automatic diversification of purchases, and the platform is therefore sustainable and responsive in the DeFi economy. Price Discovery Correct price data must be present so that borrowing, lending, and liquidation can be secure. Mutuum Finance uses Chainlink oracles to supply the system with USD and native token market prices such as ETH, MATIC, and AVAX. The system relies on fallback oracles, combined feed, and time-weighted average decentralized exchange prices to keep valuations as precise in stress market conditions. Lending: Dual-Layer Lending Framework The project’s double-lending mechanism offers consumers a balance between borrowing Peer-to-Peer lending (P2P) or lending directly from smart contracts (P2C) The P2C mechanism involves smart contracts constantly monitoring markets to receive maximum interest payment so that the borrowers can lend sensibly directly with the automatic payment of interest to investors. P2P platform gives the lender and the borrower a chance to negotiate between themselves independently without relying on any middleman, thus providing freedom and autonomy on the platform. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is becoming one of the top whales’ targets for the next major bull run ride. Stage 6 tokens are priced at $0.035, while Stage 7 price will rise by 14.29% to $0.04. The project has already collected $15.63M and attracted 16,240+ investors with strong early traction. As SHIB is consolidating at $0.00001317, whales are entering MUTM for higher upside. Purchase Stage 6 tokens now before the next price hike.

Known as XLS-86 Firewall , the amendment is designed to block scams and stop the loss of XRP tokens from wallets—a long-awaited safeguard for a community that has endured heavy losses in the past. How The New XRP Ledger Update Will Protect Investors The XRP Ledger is preparing to roll out one of its most significant security-focused updates, known as the XLS-86 Firewall. Announced by a dUNL Validator identified as ‘Vet’ on X social media, the proposal aims to provide a safeguard against the increasing number of scams targeting XRP holders . At its core, the amendment is created to give investors greater control over how their transactions are executed, limiting the chances of bad actors draining their wallets . The firewall will allow account owners to impose customized restrictions on outgoing transactions, including time-based limits and value-based thresholds. This means that even if an attacker manages to gain access to a private key, they cannot instantly withdraw funds from the account. Instead, these restrictions buy valuable time for the legitimate owner to react and secure their holdings. Another vital component of the amendment is the “whitelist” mechanism. With this feature, investors can authorize a list of trusted accounts that are exempt from firewall restrictions, ensuring that daily transactions are not disrupted. This design balances security with usability, giving users confidence that their systems are protected without adding unnecessary friction to daily workflows. Notably, activation of the firewall is left to the user’s discretion, allowing them to tailor security to their needs and risk tolerance. For retail investors and small enterprises, the upgrade offers a critical advantage by providing an extra layer of protection against scam attacks . Traditionally, multisignature protection has been touted as a robust security layer; however, it remains complicated for the average user to implement. By contrast, the upcoming XRPL firewall offers a more accessible solution that complements existing transaction flows. Its simplicity and promised defense against unauthorized transfers make it a potentially game-changing new security upgrade for XRP holders. Why XRPL Needed A Firewall Security Upgrade The development of the XLS-86 Firewall did not arise independently but as a response to persistent and growing threats against the XRP community . Over the years, malicious actors have repeatedly exploited unsuspecting investors, employing tactics that range from phishing campaigns to impersonation scams. Just recently, the CTO of Ripple, David Schwartz, flagged a fake airdrop scheme that could have inflicted serious losses on unsuspecting investors had it gone unnoticed. Currently, the XRP Ledger does not provide any built-in safeguards to stop a compromised account from being drained instantly. However, with the development of the new firewall upgrade, XRP investors will be allowed to set protective rules that delay or restrict suspicious outgoing transfers, reducing the likelihood of catastrophic financial losses while still giving them full custody of their funds.",XRP|David Schwartz|dUNL Validator|ripple|XLS-86 Firewall|XRP Ledger|XRP news|XRP price|XRPL|XRPUSD|XRPUSDT,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|XRP|BUSINESS|WALLET|AIRDROP,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-09-13 20:00:40

The survey collected responses from 111 out of 190 Guild members and found that most are earning 50% to 60% less than their peers in similar roles. Compensation Gap Median salaries for surveyed Ethereum developers came in at about $140,000, compared with offers averaging $300,000 at rival projects. The report also detailed pay by area of focus, with average salaries at $130,000 for client developers, $215,000 for researchers, and $130,000 for coordination roles. Additionally, these contributors said that they don’t get any equity or token exposure from their employers. The general allocation was $0, with only 37% of respondents receiving anything. On the other hand, final-stage offers made to their peers at rival organizations in the past year included a median equity or token share of 6.5%. This ranges from cofounder-level allocations of 10% to 30% to early employee grants of 0.1% to 3%. The gap has created pressure; almost 40% of respondents have received outside job offers in the past year. In total, 108 were disclosed across 42 individuals, with the average package reaching $359,000. Some developers said they had been offered as much as $700,000 to move elsewhere. Closing the Pay Disparity Established in 2022, Protocol Guild has become a lifeline for such developers. Backed by the “1% Pledge” from projects including EigenLayer, Ether.fi, Taiko, and Puffer, the group has distributed over $33 million since launch. VanEck also pledged 10% of profits from its spot Ether ETF to the initiative in 2023. Over the last 12 months, the average Guild member received $66,000 through this funding, while the median distribution was $74,285. That support represented nearly one-third of total annual compensation for many employees, with the mean pay rising from $140,000 to $207,121. Survey responses show how important this extra support has been, with 59% of participants rating Guild funding as “very” or “extremely important” to their ability to keep working on Ethereum. The network has secured nearly $1 trillion in value, serves millions of users, and powers thousands of applications reliant on key upgrades. Protocol Guild warned that inadequate compensation puts Ethereum at risk by undermining developer retention, slowing progress on the roadmap, and threatening long-term neutrality. The group also emphasized that aligning pay with market rates is important to keep talent in place and ensure the ecosystem’s future growth.

In that episode, titled “Frinkcoin,” Professor Frink invents a digital currency that skyrockets in popularity, catapulting him to sudden wealth. Amelie highlights this storyline as more than simple satire, arguing that it reflects a long-planned financial transformation in which XRP now sits at the heart. From Satire to Symbolism For decades, The Simpsons has been celebrated for comedy that occasionally mirrors real-world developments, from smartwatches to political events. “Frinkcoin,” which aired on February 23, 2020, offered a humorous but surprisingly detailed look at cryptocurrency’s potential to reshape money and power. Amelie suggests the episode’s portrayal of a breakthrough digital asset prefigures today’s growing institutional embrace of blockchain technology. While the cartoon is fiction, its depiction of rapid adoption and cultural upheaval resonates with current debates around XRP’s role in the next phase of global finance. The Simpsons told us again It’s all planned for a long time… and #XRP is right in the center of it! pic.twitter.com/83O85EGBHK — 𝓐𝓶𝓮𝓵𝓲𝓮 (@_Crypto_Barbie) September 13, 2025 The Legal Backdrop Beyond cultural references, XRP’s real-world journey has been shaped by a high-stakes legal battle. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission sued Ripple Labs in 2020, alleging that XRP was sold as an unregistered security. After years of courtroom sparring, the case effectively ended in late June 2025. Judge Analisa Torres rejected earlier settlement proposals but ultimately approved the mutual withdrawal of all appeals, closing the chapter on one of the crypto industry’s longest regulatory fights. Ripple confirmed on June 27 that it had dropped its counter-appeal, and the SEC is no longer pursuing its own. This final resolution removed a major cloud over XRP’s future and cleared the way for broader institutional participation. Market Momentum and ETF Prospects With legal uncertainty lifted, attention has shifted to potential exchange-traded funds (ETFs) that could give investors regulated exposure to XRP. Several asset managers are reportedly preparing filings for spot-market products , following the path that Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs have already begun to carve. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Approval of an XRP-linked ETF would represent a major milestone , unlocking new liquidity channels and lending further credibility to the asset that once faced heavy regulatory scrutiny. Culture Meets Capital Amelie’s argument is not that The Simpsons literally predicted XRP’s rise, but that popular culture can foreshadow technological and economic change. The “Frinkcoin” episode captured how innovation and public enthusiasm can collide to create seismic market shifts long before traditional institutions react. XRP’s evolving story—legal vindication, growing institutional interest, and a community attuned to cultural signals—illustrates how narrative and regulation can converge to influence financial reality. Amelie’s post invites readers to view XRP through a wider cultural lens. Whether or not one believes The Simpsons offered a roadmap, the parallels underscore how ideas once dismissed as entertainment can reflect genuine economic trends. With the SEC case closed and ETF speculation building, XRP stands at a pivotal moment where popular narrative and market fundamentals intersect—just as a satirical cartoon imagined years ago.

In his assessment, Wedson pointed out that this level was one of the points where the market tended to slow down or form local peaks in the past. “Any price above $117,000 enters a zone of strong interest and indecision. Therefore, a clear break above $118,000 would be a sign of strength,” Wedson said.

Walker, who reported directly to AI chief John Giannandrea, used to be in charge of Siri until recently. He changed roles earlier this year to lead Apple’s Answers team after a major reshuffling, which some attribute to the challenges Apple was facing with rolling out Apple Intelligence . Oversight of Siri was transferred to software engineering head Craig Federighi after promised improvements to the assistant were delayed. A future release now in question Walker was reportedly moved on to oversee the development of a new AI-powered web search tool similar to products from Perplexity and ChatGPT. The search project is scheduled for release in 2026, but with his impending exit, the timeline for that launch may be called into question. Walker was known internally as a defender of Siri’s long-term potential. In a March internal meeting, he likened Apple’s work on AI to “swimming hundreds of miles” only to be criticized for “not getting to Hawaii,” acknowledging delays but insisting progress was significant. An exodus of AI talent Walker’s exit follows a string of high-profile departures from Apple’s AI division. Ruoming Pang, who led Apple’s AI models team, left for Meta earlier this year, with several engineers and researchers following him. Frank Chu, another senior figure who was working in the search services team, has also moved to Meta. This talent flight has intensified concerns about Apple’s ability to retain top AI talent at a time when rivals, including Google, Meta, and Microsoft, are racing ahead with advanced generative AI products. The defections risk hollowing out Apple’s institutional expertise just as demand for generative AI capabilities in consumer hardware accelerates. The departures come as Apple’s AI strategy faces heat from investors and consumers. The company unveiled its “Apple Intelligence” suite of features earlier this year, integrating large language models into the iPhone and Mac. What’s next for Apple? Critics point out that Siri, launched in 2011, has failed to capitalize on a technology it pioneered more than a decade ago, and now it’s lagging behind in the race for AI leadership. The development of Apple’s own AI-powered search system was welcomed with enthusiasm, especially by its ecosystem, as it was seen as the next major step for the tech giant. Its debut, however, may now be delayed under new leadership. Despite the recent challenges, some investors remain optimistic about Apple’s chances of turning the tide around.

Layer Brett, a next-generation meme coin with real utility, has surpassed $3.5 million in its presale , fusing viral culture with essential blockchain scalability. Layer Brett: New meme coin season Layer Brett stands out by offering a solution to common Ethereum Layer 1 challenges, namely slow transactions and expensive gas fees. Layer Brett processes up to 10,000 transactions per second (TPS)—with gas fees that go down as much as $0.0001. This innovative approach gives $LBRETT a significant edge in a market hungry for efficient, low-cost alternatives. It truly bridges meme power with real speed and utility. Layer Brett aims to disrupt the meme token landscape by offering high-speed, low-cost transactions, significant staking rewards, and a vibrant community ecosystem. $LBRETT operates transactions off-chain to reduce congestion on the mainnet, while still anchoring to Ethereum for security. This mechanism unlocks throughput, compresses fees, and shrinks wait times, enabling near-instant transactions and dramatically reduced gas costs compared to Ethereum’s $10–$20 fees. By leveraging this efficiency, Layer Brett can provide significantly higher staking rewards, ensuring users get more for their efforts. A clear path for XRP XRP is positioned for a big move. The XRP news shows its price has broken out of a long-term symmetrical triangle pattern, signaling that a major accumulation phase is over. With XRP news about new institutional interest and potential for an ETF, a strong rally is imminent ADA’s researched-backed rally Cardano is a unique blockchain focused on security and sustainability, utilizing its peer-reviewed Ouroboros protocol. Its ongoing upgrades are designed to enhance ADA’s performance. When it comes to Cardano price prediction, technical analysis supports a powerful rally for ADA for the rest of 2025. A recent breakout from a multi-year consolidation pattern signals a new uptrend. ADA price is expected to rise significantly as its ecosystem expands. But given the large market cap, ADA will need to push really hard to make any major gains. Layer Brett: sparking meme rally Bringing utility to memes, Layer Brett is set to lead the meme coin rally. DeFi functionality makes $LBRETT larger than life, with potential to outpace other meme giants. The $LBRETT presale is ongoing at $0.0055 per token , offering early entrants a chance to earn more than 700% APY through instant staking. This low entry price, combined with high yields and a $1 million giveaway, attracts significant interest. DeFi functionality is nothing without efficiency, and here is where the ETH Layer 2 steps in. Building off its security, Layer Brett is completely decentralized, and offers anonymity, with no KYC requirements, and governance options. The experts’ verdict: Layer Brett can do 100x in 2026, beating even XRP and the best of ADA. Get it while it’s hot! Layer Brett is still in its presale for $0.0055 , but not for long. Early backers are positioned for significant rewards through staking and dynamic ecosystem incentives. This Layer 2 crypto offers a unique blend of fun and function, distinguishing itself from utility-free origins. Now’s your chance to be part of the Layer Brett movement.

Exxon’s announcement hands a boost to the electric vehicle industry as it becomes a supplier of a new synthetic material capable of solving critical challenges in the industry From oil to EV materials Exxon Mobil Corp. is making a big splash in the electric vehicle (EV) supply industry with the announcement of a synthetic graphite material that it claims can extend EV battery life by up to 30%. The company’s Chief Executive Officer, Darren Woods, unveiled the innovation on Friday at the University of Texas at Austin’s Energy Symposium, describing it as a “revolutionary step change in battery performance.” Exxon said that the new carbon molecule is already being tested by several EV manufacturers. This material could allow for faster charging, longer lifespans, and extended driving ranges in electric vehicles. Exxon intends to secure its supply chain and has already acquired production assets from Chicago-based Superior Graphite earlier this week. The company plans to scale up manufacturing of the material and is aiming for commercial production by 2029. Exxon insists that it does not intend to become a battery maker, but the company sees this as an opportunity to leverage its network of refineries, chemical plants, and research laboratories to support the development of clean energy. “We don’t do wind and solar, we have no issues with wind and solar, but we don’t have capability in that space,” Woods said . “But we do have capability of transforming molecules and there are enormous opportunities in that space to use hydrogen and carbon molecules to meet the growing demand.” The company has hinted at plans to enter the lithium extraction business as well. The company has a history in the industry. It invented the lithium-ion battery in the 1970s, produced the plastic film for the first rechargeable version in 1991, and developed new separator materials for batteries nearly two decades ago. Exxon backtracking on its hydrogen ambitions Exxon’s inclusion of hydrogen as part of its energy transition strategy began around 2018–2021, but the company has had research ties to hydrogen going back at least to the early 2000s. The company has warned that its planned low-carbon hydrogen and ammonia project in Baytown, Texas, may face delays due to weak customer demand. The regulatory environment is also currently a hindrance to the company’s plans. Woods stated that the shortened timeframe for claiming hydrogen tax credits under President Donald Trump’s “ Big Beautiful Bill ” could slow the market’s development. “Our big concern today around low-carbon hydrogen is whether there’s enough time within that bill to incentivize the development of the market,” Woods said. “We can’t do it on charity.” KEY Difference Wire helps crypto brands break through and dominate headlines fast",Tech|Exxon,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|MARKET|REGULATION|RESEARCH|BUSINESS|COMMODITY,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-09-13 20:50:15

The cryptocurrency world is always buzzing with activity, and few events capture attention quite like a substantial movement of digital assets. Recently, the crypto community observed a truly remarkable event: a USDT whale transfer involving a staggering sum. This transaction, valued at approximately $207 million, saw 206,964,406 USDT move from the OKX exchange to an undisclosed wallet address. Such a significant shift often sparks questions and speculation among investors and market watchers alike. What Exactly Happened in This USDT Whale Transfer? Blockchain tracking service Whale Alert was the first to report this massive transaction. The data clearly showed 206,964,406 Tether (USDT) departing from a known OKX wallet. This substantial amount then landed in an address classified as ‘unknown’ – meaning it’s not publicly linked to an exchange or a known institutional entity. A USDT whale transfer refers to the movement of a very large quantity of a stablecoin, in this case, Tether (USDT), by a single entity or group. These entities, often called ‘whales,’ hold enough cryptocurrency to potentially influence market prices. USDT, being a stablecoin pegged to the US dollar, is frequently used for large-scale transfers due to its stability and ease of movement between exchanges. Understanding these transfers is crucial for grasping the underlying currents of the crypto market. While the specifics of the recipient remain a mystery, the sheer volume of this transaction warrants closer examination. Why Do Such Massive USDT Whale Transfers Matter? Large transfers like this USDT whale transfer can have several implications for the broader cryptocurrency ecosystem. Firstly, they can signal a shift in market sentiment. A whale moving funds off an exchange might indicate an intention to hold long-term, suggesting confidence in future price appreciation. Conversely, moving funds to an exchange could precede a large selling order, potentially impacting market prices. Moreover, such transfers affect liquidity. When a significant amount of a stablecoin like USDT moves, it can influence the available liquidity on exchanges, which in turn affects trading pairs and overall market stability. For instance, if the funds are being prepared for a large purchase of another cryptocurrency, it could signal an upcoming upward price movement for that asset. The anonymity of the receiving wallet also adds a layer of intrigue. While blockchain technology provides transparency regarding transactions, the identity behind the wallet address often remains private. This balance between transparency and privacy is a fundamental aspect of the crypto world. Who Could Be Behind This Significant USDT Whale Transfer? Identifying the exact entity behind a large USDT whale transfer is challenging due to the pseudonymous nature of blockchain addresses. However, market analysts often consider several possibilities. It could be an institutional investor making a strategic move, perhaps rebalancing a portfolio or preparing for a major investment in another digital asset. Another common scenario involves exchanges themselves. They often move large sums of crypto between their hot and cold wallets for security reasons or to manage liquidity. While the transaction originated from OKX, the destination being an ‘unknown wallet’ suggests it’s likely not an internal exchange transfer to another of their known addresses. Alternatively, a high-net-worth individual or a large decentralized finance (DeFi) protocol could be behind the move. Regardless of the identity, the scale of this transaction positions the recipient as a significant player in the crypto space, capable of influencing market dynamics. How Should Investors React to a Large USDT Whale Transfer? For everyday investors, observing a large USDT whale transfer should primarily serve as an informational cue rather than an immediate call to action. It is crucial to avoid panic or making impulsive decisions based solely on such news. Instead, consider these actionable insights: Monitor Market Trends: Keep an eye on the overall market sentiment and any subsequent price movements of major cryptocurrencies. Large stablecoin transfers can sometimes precede significant price action. Understand the Context: While a transfer is notable, it’s just one piece of a larger puzzle. Look for other market indicators, news, and analysis to form a comprehensive view. Diversify Your Portfolio: Relying too heavily on one asset or reacting to every large transaction can be risky. A diversified portfolio helps mitigate the impact of individual market events. Conduct Your Own Research: Always verify information and understand the fundamentals of the assets you invest in. Do not solely depend on whale movements as a trading signal. In conclusion, the recent USDT whale transfer from OKX to an unknown wallet is a powerful reminder of the dynamic and often opaque nature of the cryptocurrency market. While the exact motives behind such a colossal move remain shrouded in mystery, it highlights the significant capital flowing within the digital asset space. For investors, it underscores the importance of staying informed, understanding market mechanics, and making well-researched decisions rather than reacting to every large transaction. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) What is a crypto whale? A crypto whale is an individual or entity that holds a very large amount of a particular cryptocurrency. Their substantial holdings mean their transactions can significantly impact market prices and liquidity. What is USDT (Tether)? USDT is a stablecoin, a type of cryptocurrency designed to maintain a stable value, typically pegged to a fiat currency like the US dollar. It’s widely used for trading, lending, and transferring value across the crypto ecosystem due to its stability. Why are large USDT transfers significant? Large USDT transfers are significant because they can indicate major shifts in market sentiment, potential liquidity changes on exchanges, or preparation for large purchases or sales of other cryptocurrencies. They often reflect the actions of major market players. Can the recipient of an unknown wallet transfer be identified? While blockchain transactions are public, the identity behind a wallet address is usually pseudonymous. Unless the wallet owner voluntarily reveals their identity or links it to a regulated entity, identifying them directly from the blockchain is very difficult. Should I change my investment strategy based on a whale transfer? It’s generally not advisable to change your entire investment strategy based on a single whale transfer. While such events are informative, they are just one data point. It’s better to combine this information with broader market analysis, fundamental research, and your personal financial goals.

As the market matures, a growing number of analysts are arguing that Ruvi AI (RUVI) has become a no-brainer investment choice over established utility tokens like Ripple (XRP). With a 100x forecast gaining credibility and daily token sales continuing at a pace of millions, Ruvi AI is rapidly solidifying its position as a project on the verge of a major breakout. This confident outlook is fueled by a presale that is nothing short of sensational. The Ruvi AI presale is rocketing towards the $3.6 million fundraising milestone, a clear signal of immense market conviction. A fast-growing global community of over 3,500 holders has already acquired more than 265 million RUVI tokens . This intense buying pressure, which sees millions of tokens sold daily, indicates that the 100x forecast might be nearing reality sooner than anyone expected. The Clear Advantage: Why Ruvi AI is a No-Brainer for 100x Gains The argument for choosing Ruvi AI over Ripple boils down to one simple factor: exponential growth potential. For Ripple, a 100x return from its current position is a mathematical near-impossibility due to its massive market capitalization. The window for life-changing gains has long since closed. Ruvi AI, however, presents the perfect formula for a 100x run. It combines a low initial market cap with powerful, real-world utility in the booming $104 billion creator economy . Its value is not based on speculation, but on its revolutionary super app designed to solve tangible problems for millions of users. This fundamental strength is what underpins its 100x potential and has been further validated by a successful smart contract audit from CyberScope and a prominent listing on CoinMarketCap . The Super App Fueling the Breakout The engine driving Ruvi AI’s unstoppable momentum is its game-changing super app. This all-in-one platform is set to become an essential tool for content creators, building a foundation for mass adoption that could send its token value soaring. Its integrated features include: Advanced Trend Research: Helps creators identify viral topics before they become saturated, providing a significant competitive advantage. AI-Powered Script Generation: Creates engaging, platform-optimized scripts for YouTube, TikTok, and Instagram in seconds. Native Media Creation: Generates professional-quality images and videos directly within the app, streamlining content production. Streamlined Workflows: Centralizes the entire creative process for maximum efficiency. Urgent Alert: A 40% Price Surge Is Guaranteed The presale is currently in Phase 3 , with the RUVI token available at an attractive $0.020 . But with millions of tokens selling daily, this ground-floor price is disappearing fast. According to the project’s official tokenomics, the start of Phase 4 will trigger an automatic and guaranteed 40% price increase to $0.028 . This imminent price jump is creating intense FOMO as investors rush to lock in a guaranteed paper gain. Strategic Partnership and High-Reward VIP Tiers Ruvi AI’s journey towards a potential 100x return is further amplified by a strategic partnership with WEEX , a major cryptocurrency exchange. This collaboration will ensure deep liquidity and a seamless trading experience upon launch, paving the way for rapid price discovery and broad market adoption. For investors aiming to turn the 100x forecast into reality, the project’s VIP program offers a clear path: VIP 5 ($10,000 investment): Unlock 1,000,000 tokens with a 100% bonus (500,000 additional tokens). At a $1 valuation, this reaches $1,000,000, achieving a 9,900% ROI . VIP 3 ($2,000 investment): Secure 160,000 tokens with a 60% bonus (60,000 additional tokens). At a $1 valuation, this totals $160,000, delivering a 7,900% ROI . VIP 2 ($1,000 investment): Receive 70,000 tokens with a 40% bonus (20,000 additional tokens). At a $1 valuation, this equals $70,000, resulting in a 6,900% ROI . A competitive leaderboard giveaway also rewards top supporters, fostering a vibrant and engaged community that adds to the project’s unstoppable momentum. The Time to Act is Now As the presale accelerates and a guaranteed price increase looms, it’s clear why Ruvi AI is being called a no-brainer. For investors looking to move beyond the limited upside of established tokens and into a project with a clear path to 100x returns, the opportunity is here and now.

NVT Reading Suggests So",https://www.newsbtc.com/news/ethereum/is-ethereum-undervalued-nvt-reading-suggests-so/,"The latest on-chain data shows that the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, Ethereum, may be currently undervalued. Having witnessed a strong resurgence in the past week, the altcoin could be on the verge of an extended rally over the next few weeks. Ethereum’s NVT Ratio Hits New Record Low In a Quicktake post on the CryptoQuant platform, crypto analyst CryptoOnchain reported that there has been a disproportionate increase in transaction volume concerning ETH compared to its market capitalization. The relevant indicator here is the Ethereum NVT (Network Value to Transactions ratio) (30-day SMA), which measures the ratio of Ethereum’s market capitalization to its daily transaction volume over the span of 30 days. Related Reading: XRP Exchange Reserves Balloon 1.2 Billion In One Day, Why This Is Bearish For Price CryptoOnchain revealed that the 30-day moving average NVT recently hit its lowest point ever recorded. As explained by the on-chain analyst, this could suggest two things: firstly, that the Ethereum token is undervalued. For context, a low NVT reflects very high transaction volume compared to a relatively low market capitalization. What this means is that the Ethereum network is being heavily used, but the price isn’t showing its worth as much as its usage suggests. Following this logic, one could conclude the market is currently undervaluing Ethereum’s utility. The second indication from the historically low NVT is that the increase in transaction volume could be due to “temporary factors such as DeFi, NFT events, or large capital movements.” According to the analyst, these temporary factors do not necessarily mean sustainable growth for the ETH price. What To Expect CryptoOnchain cited historical occurrences to explain the typical case where an NVT bottom is a result of market undervaluation. In this case, it has been observed that sharp NVT bottoms precede bullish phases. However, in what was a caveat, the online pundit mentioned that there have been cases where very low NVT levels were accompanied by further price declines. Seeing that the Ethereum NVT is not just at a mere low level, but at its all-time low, it seems more likely that the market is undervaluing the token’s worth. It is therefore not out of the question to expect a more upward swing in the price of the cryptocurrency. Related Reading: Ethereum To $6,800 By Year End? CME Futures Data Shows Record Institutional Demand Nevertheless, with the possibility that a bullish phase might not necessarily follow in mind, investors might want to tread cautiously. As of this writing, the Ethereum token is valued at approximately $4,670, reflecting an over 4% price increase in the past 24 hours.

Once dismissed as speculative novelties, today’s meme-driven tokens have matured into cultural and financial movements with real communities and unique tokenomics. At the center of this transformation are the top meme coin presales in 2025, projects that combine narrative strength with structured tokenomics to appeal to both retail traders and analysts. Among these, top meme coin presales in 2025 like BullZilla ($BZIL) , Dogecoin, and Cat in a Dog’s World are leading the charge. They are not just attracting hype but also presenting frameworks that align with long-term sustainability. For investors seeking the top meme coin presales in 2025, these projects provide a window into how speculative assets can evolve into structured ecosystems with exponential growth potential. BullZilla: The Mutation Presale That Redefines Tokenomics BullZilla presale sits in its second stage, aptly named “Dead Wallets Don’t Lie”, with the token priced at $0.00005241. Over $370,000 has been raised and more than 1,300 holders have already secured their positions. This momentum is not accidental; it is rooted in BullZilla’s Zilla DNA, a tokenomic structure designed to balance scarcity, growth, and long-term sustainability. Zilla DNA: Tokenomics That Drive the Ecosystem BullZilla has a total supply of 160 billion tokens, distributed strategically across five categories that serve different functions within the ecosystem: Presale Engine (50% – 80 billion tokens): This allocation ensures community engagement at the earliest stages, powering the progressive presale model that raises both capital and awareness. HODL Furnace Staking (20% – 32 billion tokens): Designed to reward long-term holders with APYs up to 70%, this mechanism incentivizes loyalty while reducing volatility by locking tokens away. Treasury and Ecosystem (20% – 32 billion tokens): Reserved for development, marketing, and operational stability to ensure BullZilla evolves beyond its initial presale stage. Burn Pool Reserve (5% – 8 billion tokens): The Roar Burn Mechanism periodically destroys tokens, reducing supply and tightening market dynamics as new chapters in BullZilla’s lore unfold. Team Allocation (5% – 8 billion tokens): Locked for two years, aligning the team’s rewards with the project’s long-term success. This structure ensures a balance between immediate liquidity, future growth, and deflationary pressure. Unlike earlier meme coins that launched without clear frameworks, BullZilla’s presale blueprint mirrors professional tokenomic models outlined in academic research on deflationary cryptocurrencies (see studies from MIT’s Digital Currency Initiative). The Mutation Mechanism: Dynamic Pricing in Action What truly sets BullZilla apart is its progressive pricing engine. The cost of each token increases every time $100,000 is raised or every 48 hours, whichever comes first. This mechanism ensures a continuous upward trajectory, rewarding early adopters and creating a self-sustaining cycle of demand. Reports from Messari highlight how progressive presales reduce the risk of price collapse by aligning token price growth with demand dynamics. BullZilla applies this principle at scale, making it one of the best crypto to buy today for investors who understand the mathematics of scarcity. How to Buy BullZilla Coins For those looking to join, the process is streamlined and accessible even for newcomers to crypto. Set Up a Wallet: Install a Web3 wallet such as MetaMask or Trust Wallet. Buy Ethereum (ETH): Acquire ETH via exchanges like Binance or Coinbase and transfer it to your wallet. Visit the Presale Site: Connect your wallet directly to the official BullZilla presale portal. Swap ETH for $BZIL: Enter the amount you wish to purchase, confirm the transaction, and your allocation is secured. Each purchase contributes to the presale tally, pushing the price higher and reinforcing the narrative of momentum. Investment Scenario: $1,000 in BullZilla Presale Price: $0.00005241 Tokens Purchased: 19,081,376 $BZIL Value at $0.01: $190,813 Value at $0.10: $1.9 million This projection highlights the exponential ROI potential if Bull Zilla reaches benchmarks achieved by earlier meme coins like Shiba Inu. It is speculative yet grounded in historical precedent, with Shiba’s 2021 surge serving as a comparative case study documented by Chainalysis. Dogecoin: The Original Meme Coin That Started It All Dogecoin (DOGE) began in 2013 as a lighthearted meme coin inspired by the Shiba Inu dog meme, but it quickly grew into one of the most recognizable names in cryptocurrency. Originally created by Billy Markus and Jackson Palmer, Dogecoin was designed to be a fun, community-driven digital currency. It runs on its own blockchain, using Proof-of-Work mining similar to Bitcoin, but with faster block times and virtually unlimited supply. This makes DOGE well-suited for microtransactions, tipping online creators, and charitable campaigns, which became core aspects of its early adoption. Over time, Dogecoin’s strong and passionate community, coupled with endorsements from public figures like Elon Musk, pushed it into mainstream recognition. Despite its origins as a joke, Dogecoin has proven resilient and remains one of the largest cryptocurrencies by market cap. Its accessibility, low transaction costs, and vibrant culture make it a favorite for both newcomers and seasoned investors. While it doesn’t have the scarcity of Bitcoin, Dogecoin thrives on community strength and remains a cultural phenomenon in the crypto world. Cat in a Dog’s World: The Feline Challenger to Doge Dominance Cat in a Dog’s World (ticker: MEW) is a newer meme coin project that flips the narrative of meme dominance by positioning cats as rivals to the “dog coin” trend. Built as a playful but strategic counter to Dogecoin and Shiba Inu, MEW taps into internet culture’s love for cats while aiming to build a serious ecosystem around the meme. It exists primarily on Solana, benefiting from low transaction fees, high scalability, and fast transfers, which makes it an attractive alternative for users tired of congestion on older blockchains. The project isn’t just about the joke—it also emphasizes community, gamification, and utility. Holders of MEW participate in social campaigns, NFTs, and staking opportunities designed to expand the token’s ecosystem. With its unique branding, strong meme identity, and rapid community adoption, Cat in a Dog’s World seeks to capture the next wave of meme coin enthusiasm. Positioned as both a cultural statement and a practical Solana-based asset, MEW is quickly carving out a space in a market long dominated by “dog coins.” Conclusion The top meme coin presales in 2025 are redefining how investors look at meme-driven projects. BullZilla leads with its progressive presale mechanism, already raising o ver $370k in s tage two, while Dogecoin thrives on viral culture and Cat in a Dog’s World bridges NFTs with tokenized liquidity. Together, these tokens form a new class of speculative yet structured opportunities. For those analyzing the top meme coin presales in 2025, it becomes clear that projects with strong tokenomics and community alignment stand apart from fleeting market trends. BullZilla, with its Mutation Presale and deflationary mechanics, emerges as the strongest contender. Anyone watching the top meme coin presales in 2025 can see that the market is evolving from memes into movements, creating opportunities that could shape the next generation of crypto wealth.

This imbalance already leaves the U.S. with a 7% budget deficit even without a downturn . The problem becomes explosive once recession dynamics kick in. When the economy contracts, government revenue typically drops around 20%. That would cut today’s $5 trillion revenue base down to roughly $3.9 trillion. At the same time, automatic programs like unemployment benefits and discretionary stimulus push spending higher—potentially from $7.1 trillion to over $9 trillion. Combined, this means a deficit of $5+ trillion, or nearly 18% of GDP , a level unseen in U.S. history. The real danger is how debt interacts with growth. In the 1980s, each new dollar of debt produced $3 of GDP. Now, it generates just $0.37, and the return keeps falling. Piling trillions in new debt during a recession could choke growth further, while rising borrowing needs might drive bond yields and interest costs sharply higher . Every 1% rise in yields would add another $370 billion in annual interest, pushing deficits closer to $7 trillion. This creates a vicious cycle: falling GDP, collapsing tax revenue, soaring spending, and rising borrowing costs. If markets lose faith in U.S. debt, the dollar could weaken and the Federal Reserve may be forced to step in with massive money-printing—risking inflation and financial instability on a global scale.",,EN,0,0,MACROECONOMICS|BUSINESS|REGULATION|FIAT|MARKET,"{'name': 'Coinpaprika', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/80/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaprika,2025-09-13 21:38:46

Pi Network, the mobile friendly mining blockchain, is showing signs of weakening. PI holders are still waiting on a proper mainnet, and with a massive token lock-up end impending, PI has a high probability of making a serious dip. But there’s a strong case to be made for Layer Brett ($LBRETT), Cronos (CRO), and Solana (SOL) as the best cryptos to invest in right now. What are the reasons for experts backing CRO, SOL, and the upcoming meme leader $LBRETT ? Layer Brett: Filling The Demand for Scalability The crypto market increasingly seeks solutions for network congestion and high transaction fees. Ethereum Layer 2s are critical, driven by demands for faster transactions and dramatically lower gas fees. Many altcoins and DeFi coins struggle with Layer 1 limitations. Layer Brett steps into this burgeoning market, offering a next-generation Layer 2 blockchain built for efficiency. Layer Brett fuses viral culture with substantial blockchain utility. It enables lightning-fast transactions (10,000 TPS) and low gas fees ($0.0001). This architecture helps it escape Ethereum Layer 1’s typical congestion and high costs. $LBRETT is purpose-built for performance and user rewards, offering early staking benefits and an evolving ecosystem that promises full Layer 2 functionality. Early buyers of Layer Brett presale (currently at $0.0055) benefit from enhanced staking rates (over 700% APY, but falling), and its fixed supply of 10 billion tokens underscores a community-focused approach. This ecosystem includes gamified staking, NFT integrations, and a planned $1 million giveaway. What a future! PI: A Mobile Crypto with a Mixed Outlook Pi Network is a mobile-first project that lets anyone “mine” crypto from their phone. While it has a massive community, its price outlook for the rest of 2025 is mixed, with some analysts noting a bearish sentiment. The token has been trading sideways, with key technicals like the RSI remaining neutral-to-bearish. Any major upward move would require a significant catalyst like new exchange listings or a major increase in its utility, which PI seems not to do much about lately. Cronos (CRO): The Exchange’s Powerhouse CRO is a blockchain designed to connect different crypto networks, making it a key player in the “Internet of Blockchains.” With major partnerships and strategic upgrades, it is building a powerful ecosystem for DeFi, NFTs, and payments. CRO is poised for a significant bullish breakout in the rest of 2025. A recent breakout from a multi-year consolidation pattern and a bullish MACD crossover back this. The network’s new partnerships, particularly with Trump Media, and a potential U.S. ETF approval are expected to act as major catalysts, fueling a rally toward previous all-time highs and beyond. SOL’s Next Chapter Solana is the high-speed, low-cost “Ethereum Killer” that’s now a major player in its own right, powering everything from decentralized finance to major gaming projects. Its ongoing upgrades, including the Firedancer validator client, are set to further boost its performance and stability. Technical analysis points to a confirmed breakout from a long-term symmetrical triangle and a decisive golden cross on its moving averages. This is supported by surging on-chain activity and growing institutional interest, which could fuel a parabolic rally toward new highs, pushing SOL to new highs. Layer Brett: Your Best Crypto to Invest In? While SOL and CRO are set to boom in the rest of 2025, the crown of the best crypto to invest in goes to Layer Brett. Its meme/utility combo, enigmatic presale , and massive rewards put it ahead of the pack.

Cardano’s Current Momentum Cardano (ADA) is currently priced at $0.8858, and its price has been ranging from $0.8724 to $0.8934 today. Despite attempts to push through $1, ADA has faced resistance in the $0.90–$0.95 range, and volumes suggest that buyers are not yet aggressively enough to push past sellers there. Without some catalyst, i.e., major news, partnership, or institutional investment, ADA may simply drift sideways or pull back a bit before trying again. Meanwhile, newest DeFi projects such as Mutuum Finance are picking up steam on the fringes. Mutuum Finance (MUTM): Presale Phase 6 Mutuum Finance is currently in phase six of presale and in this phase, the tokens are priced at $0.035 with an increase of 16.17% from the last phase. There’s huge demand in the market as the project has already drawn more than 16,240 investors and topped $15.63 million. Apart from enhancing CertiK’s security capabilities, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has also introduced a Bug Bounty Program with a total prize of 50,000 USDT for the security of the platform. The bugs are categorized into four levels on the basis of the name critical, major, minor, and low. Mutuum Finance collateralization has a limit by asset and differs based on the type of risk an asset would impose. It contains supply capping, borrowing and collateral capping. The protocol is hedging market risk through overcollateralizing positions. The protocol incentivizes the liquidators as well for closing the trades that are undercollateralized and thus risky positions are closed in real time. The collateral use is maintained low for riskier tokens here but the highly correlated tokens are used to their maximum so that they may be able to get the most out of their collateral. All these are used for insolvency risk avoidance in such a manner that no form of imbalance is generated in lending and borrowing within the protocol. User Community and Growth Development Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is looking to expand an active user base with an grassroots campaign of organizing a $100,000 giveaway . Ten users will receive $10,000 MUTM tokens each as part of the campaign for encouraging investments on the protocol. Security Framework and Back-up Plan Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is an LTV construct with risk-of-assets contingent one with subjective collateral, transfer and liquidation lending but risk-of-assets contingent. It also contains a reserve factor as back-up and very bad market condition buffer. Risk assets are reserved higher in an effort to provide higher security to the protocol and users. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is gaining investor interest as Cardano (ADA) struggles to break $1. Stage 6 presale tokens are at $0.035, a 16.17% premium already from the last round, with more than 16,240 investors putting in $15.63M. Backed by a $50K CertiK bug bounty, $100K giveaway, and robust overcollateralization risk mitigants, MUTM earns respect while pushing lightning adoption. ADA continues to bounce at resistance levels of $0.90–$0.95, but Mutuum momentum increases mounting DeFi adoption. Lock in your Stage 6 tokens before they move up to $0.04 on the next stage.

Right now, a powerful new project, Ruvi AI (RUVI), is demonstrating a level of presale velocity that has analysts buzzing. With Phase 3 of its presale already nearing the 10% sold mark just days after launch, experts suggest Ruvi AI has the momentum to challenge even a top-10 giant like Cardano (ADA) for a spot in the charts. This isn’t just speculation; it’s backed by explosive presale numbers. Ruvi AI is rapidly closing in on the $3.6 million milestone, having sold over 265 million tokens to a fast-growing community of more than 3,500 investors . This tidal wave of support signals that the market sees Ruvi AI not just as another altcoin, but as a potential market leader. A Strategic Challenge to the Old Guard The comparison to Cardano is about potential and timing. Cardano is a mature, respected project, but its massive market cap means its days of exponential growth are likely behind it. Ruvi AI, however, offers the ground-floor entry point and explosive growth potential that early Cardano investors once enjoyed. It represents a strategic pivot for investors looking for the next 100x opportunity. Ruvi AI’s credibility is a major factor in its rapid ascent. The project has proactively built investor trust by completing a comprehensive smart contract audit with CyberScope , a reputable third-party security firm. This commitment to security, combined with a high-profile listing on CoinMarketCap , has established Ruvi AI as a legitimate, high-growth project worthy of serious capital. A Super App to Revolutionize a $104 Billion Industry The engine driving Ruvi AI’s challenge to the top charts is its revolutionary super app. This all-in-one ecosystem is built to empower content creators in the booming $104 billion creator economy . By solving real-world problems, Ruvi AI is creating sustainable, long-term demand for its token. The app’s integrated AI-powered tools include: Advanced Trend Research: Identifies viral topics before they saturate the market, giving creators a competitive edge. AI-Powered Script Generation: Creates engaging, platform-optimized scripts for YouTube, TikTok, and Instagram, saving valuable time. Native Media Creation: Allows users to generate professional-quality images and videos directly within the app, reducing production costs. Streamlined Workflows: Centralizes the entire content creation process, from planning to scheduling, to maximize productivity. Final Call: A Guaranteed 40% Price Surge Is Imminent The presale is currently in Phase 3 , with the RUVI token priced at an attractive $0.020 . However, with 10% of this phase selling out in mere days, this opportunity is closing fast. The start of Phase 4 will trigger an automatic and guaranteed 40% price increase to $0.028 . This imminent price jump is creating intense FOMO, driving record sales as investors rush to lock in an immediate paper gain. Strategic Partnership and High-Reward VIP Tiers Amplifying its growth trajectory is a strategic partnership with WEEX , a major cryptocurrency exchange. This collaboration will ensure deep liquidity and a seamless trading experience at launch, paving the way for rapid price discovery and broad market adoption. For those aiming to maximize their returns, the project’s VIP program offers a clear path to significant wealth: VIP 5 ($10,000 investment): Unlock 1,000,000 tokens with a 100% bonus (500,000 additional tokens). At a $1 valuation, this reaches $1,000,000, achieving a 9,900% ROI . VIP 3 ($2,000 investment): Secure 160,000 tokens with a 60% bonus (60,000 additional tokens). At a $1 valuation, this totals $160,000, delivering a 7,900% ROI . VIP 2 ($1,000 investment): Receive 70,000 tokens with a 40% bonus (20,000 additional tokens). At a $1 valuation, this equals $70,000, resulting in a 6,900% ROI . A competitive leaderboard giveaway also rewards top supporters, fostering a vibrant and engaged community that adds to the project’s unstoppable momentum. A New Titan Is Rising As Ruvi AI’s presale accelerates toward a sell-out and a 40% price surge looms, its potential to challenge the crypto elite becomes clearer every day. For investors who feel they missed the boat on Cardano, this is a rare second chance to get in on the ground floor of what could be this cycle’s biggest star.

After ending August and starting September below the psychological $110,000 level, the premier cryptocurrency returned to above $115,000. While the Bitcoin price has somewhat slowed down heading into the weekend, optimism is growing around the market about the possibility of a fresh rally. Interestingly, the latest on-chain data points to the increased possibility of a “momentum-driven rally” for the Bitcoin price. Binance Taker Buy Sell Ratio Remains Positive For 3 Days In a September 12 post on the X platform, crypto analyst Burak Kesmeci shared an exciting on-chain perspective to support the growing bullish narrative around the Bitcoin price. According to the online pundit, the Taker Buy Sell Ratio on the world’s largest crypto exchange, Binance, has persisted in the positive territory for three days. The Taker Buy Sell Ratio is an on-chain metric that compares the proportion of the taker buy volumes to the taker sell volumes on crypto exchanges. A greater-than-one value of this metric usually implies that the taker buy volume is higher than the taker sell volume on an exchange (Binance, in this case). This trend suggests that more traders are willing to acquire coins at a higher value on the trading platform. On the other hand, when the Taker Buy Sell ratio is below 1, it indicates that the taker sell volume is greater than the taker buy volume in the exchange. Ultimately, this value suggests that more sellers are willing to sell coins at a lower price in the open market. According to CryptoQuant data provided by Kesmeci, the Binance Taker Buy Sell ratio has been above the 1 threshold over the past three days. This metric, sitting around 1.04, suggests a growing bullish momentum and rising investor confidence in the market. What’s more, the metric’s local peaks are around 1.15 in 2025, meaning that the investor sentiment is not overheated yet and could see further rise from its current point. In this case, Kesmeci concluded that the positive investor sentiment on the world’s largest crypto exchange by trading volume could set the stage for a momentum-driven uptrend for the Bitcoin price. Bitcoin Price At A Glance As of this writing, the price of BTC stands at around $115,900, reflecting no significant movement in the past 24 hours.",Bitcoin|bitcoin|bitcoin price|btc|BTC news|btc price|BTCUSDT,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|TRADING|BTC|EXCHANGE|BUSINESS,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-09-13 22:00:46

Here’s What This Means For Viral Crypto Assets Like Remittix",https://www.cryptopolitan.com/doge-etf-approved-heres-what-this-means-for-viral-crypto-assets-like-remittix/,"Dogecoin just got a huge boost with the first DOGE ETF greenlight in the United States and traders are watching the next big move. Many expect a test of the $0.30 level soon and a break above it could spark a stronger rally. This matters for every Dogecoin price prediction on the table right now. At the same time, PayFi altcoin Remittix (RTX) is grabbing attention with a 15% USDT referral reward that pays out daily through its dashboard. Utility plus rewards makes Remittix one to watch in 2025. Dogecoin Price Prediction After ETF Approval The new Rex-Osprey Doge ETF, ticker DOJE, will trade under the Investment Company Act of 1940 framework. Analysts like Bloomberg’s Eric Balchunas say the product offers traditional investors exposure to the meme coin through regulated markets. This is a turning point for DOGE because, until now, one of the biggest criticisms was the lack of serious demand drivers. Market experts now see a higher probability of Dogecoin moving toward $0.30 from its current price of $0.264, in the short term, with prediction markets giving a 66.6% chance of this outcome. A push beyond that level could ignite stronger rallies, with $0.40–$0.50 in view if ETF inflows mirror the enthusiasm seen with Bitcoin. For now, the most common Dogecoin price prediction is that $0.30 will act as the next critical test. What This Means For Other Viral Altcoins Like Remittix While Dogecoin is enjoying renewed attention, another crypto asset is quickly gaining ground. Remittix has raised more than $25,4 million, sold over 660 million tokens and is currently priced at $0.1080. The project has already confirmed listings on BitMart and LBANK, with a third exchange on the way. A wallet beta is set to launch in September, further building momentum for the token’s rollout. Remittix is solving a $19 trillion payments problem through PayFi infrastructure Users can send crypto to bank accounts in more than 30 countries Global payout rails are already active and expanding rapidly The project is audited by CertiK, ensuring trust and transparency The 15% referral program in USDT makes adoption faster and more rewarding Final Thoughts Dogecoin’s first U.S. ETF approval is rewriting its narrative, giving investors new confidence and lifting Dogecoin price prediction targets. But at the same time, Remittix is offering something different: not just hype but utility and incentives that reward growth. For investors looking at viral crypto assets in 2025, DOGE may keep its crown as the original meme coin but Remittix is emerging as the PayFi contender that could rival its momentum.

However, Austin Hilton, a popular crypto commentator, has declared that investors are not bullish enough on XRP, while also admitting that he too had underestimated the token’s true potential. His latest outlook is that XRP’s price upside is far greater than most expect, and this realization comes from examining where Bitcoin could be in the coming years. Related Reading: ETF Dreams For Dogecoin: Serious Possibility Or Just Hype? Bitcoin’s Billion-Dollar Forecast And What It Means For XRP XRP price predictions have mostly always been anchored on discussions and expectations of adoption by banks in cross-border settlement. However, according to Austin Hilton, all these catalysts could be left aside, and XRP’s price could surge massively in the years ahead, especially if Bitcoin fulfills lofty projections. According to the pundit, the scale of the crypto opportunity in the coming decades is so immense that current investors are not bullish enough and accumulating enough XRP. He referenced a circulating forecast that predicted that Bitcoin could reach as high as $1 billion per coin by 2038, a figure championed by high-profile names such as Michael Saylor. This prediction stunned him, as the highest long-term projections he had seen had put the Bitcoin price at $13 million. Bringing the conversation back to XRP, he noted that if this projected Bitcoin rally pushes the entire market upward, as it has always done, then XRP’s value could rise even more in relative terms. Therefore, XRP has the room to act as a multiplier in comparison to Bitcoin’s moves because of its smaller market cap. The Roadmap To Double And Triple-Digit XRP As noted by Hilton, the $1 billion projection is very speculative, adding that “that absolutely floored me and blew me away.” However, the analyst also pointed out that even shorter-term moves in Bitcoin could have an outsized impact on XRP. For instance, he predicted that the XRP price will surge to between $15 and $20 if Bitcoin were to reach $200,000 by the end of the year. Furthermore, he added that XRP’s price could realistically climb to triple digits if Bitcoin advances to the $1 million price level in the coming years. In this case, the analyst estimated a potential of at least $100 per coin. Interestingly, these price targets do not even account for catalysts within XRP’s own ecosystem, such as Ripple’s cross-border payment network, acquisitions, and growing adoption among banks. XRP’s upside could be even greater when these factors are factored in. Related Reading: Dogecoin Defies Odds, Jumps 21% Even As ETF Debut Gets Pushed Back The pundit’s bottom line was that XRP holders need to raise their level of conviction. Bitcoin currently makes up around 60% of the entire crypto market, meaning that any explosive growth in its value is almost certain to lift other large market cap cryptocurrencies. XRP has a smaller cap than Bitcoin, so it could post even stronger relative gains in such an environment. At the time of writing, XRP is trading at $3.14, up by 2.9% in the past 24 hours.

Here’s Why,https://timestabloid.com/many-xrp-millionaires-will-be-born-in-october-heres-why/,"Growing optimism within the XRP community suggests that October could be a turning point for investors, with many speculating that substantial wealth could be generated in the coming month. The conversation is largely centered on the potential approval of several spot XRP exchange-traded funds (ETFs) by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Crypto commentator Kenny Nguyen recently argued that “many XRP millionaires will be born in October,” citing the likelihood of spot ETFs being approved and launched within the month. His view mirrors sentiments expressed by other figures in the community, including the influencer CryptoBull, who predicted that September may remain uneventful, but October could mark a decisive shift for XRP. MANY XRP MILLIONAIRES WILL BE BORN IN OCTOBER AFTER THE SPOT XRP ETFS APPROVAL & KICKED IN — Kenny Nguyen (@mrnguyen007) September 7, 2025 ETF Deadlines Approaching The SEC is expected to deliver rulings on multiple XRP ETF applications between October 18 and 25. At least eight major issuers, such as Grayscale, Franklin Templeton, WisdomTree, Bitwise, 21Shares, ProShares, Canary Capital, and CoinShares, are awaiting decisions. Grayscale is positioned at the forefront, with a deadline of October 18 for its application to convert its $500 million XRP Trust into a spot ETF. Analysts suggest that overall inflows from approved products could reach $8 billion during the first year, with Grayscale and Franklin Templeton potentially accounting for $1 billion each. According to Bloomberg Intelligence, the probability of approval before year-end stands at 90–95%, supported by Ripple’s favorable legal outcome against the SEC and the agency’s broader shift toward approving crypto-based investment vehicles. Should approval occur, trading could begin within 24 to 48 hours, similar to the rapid rollout of Bitcoin spot ETFs earlier this year. Market Analysts Expect Breakout Potential Oliver Michel, CEO of Tokentus Investment AG, recently shared his perspective from the Frankfurt Stock Exchange, stressing that while Bitcoin remains important, altcoins such as XRP offer greater growth potential. He projected that leading altcoins could see gains of up to 300%, far surpassing Bitcoin’s more conservative upside. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Currently trading near $3.14, XRP has been consolidating, awaiting a decisive market trigger. Michel emphasized that ETF approval could serve as the catalyst, replicating the sharp market reaction observed after Bitcoin ETF approvals. The derivatives market is already signaling heightened interest. CME Group’s XRP futures surpassed $1 billion in open interest within just three months, while futures-based XRP ETFs now hold more than $800 million in assets. Analysts believe the introduction of spot ETFs could attract significant institutional capital, accelerating upward momentum. Who Stands to Benefit Most? While community forecasts vary, with some expecting XRP to reach $10 before year-end and others predicting $30 by 2026, the possibility of rapid gains has intensified discussion around potential “XRP millionaires.” Wealth creation will likely depend on existing holdings. For example, investors with approximately 100,000 XRP, valued at around $300,000 at current prices, would cross the $1 million mark if XRP were to hit $10 in October. Data from the XRP Rich List indicates that only 34,839 accounts hold at least 95,000 XRP, while more than 5.5 million wallets contain between 20 and 500 tokens. This distribution suggests that while many retail investors may benefit from price increases, only a relatively small group of holders possesses enough tokens to reach millionaire status in the near term.

Ripple’s European expansion, including its custody partnership with BBVA, has given investors renewed confidence. But while XRP is regaining momentum, many traders are eyeing Remittix , the PayFi altcoin that has raised more than $25,4 million through the sale of 660 million tokens at $0.1080 each. Analysts argue this new project could outpace Ripple’s growth with faster real-world adoption. XRP Price Prediction Builds On Breakout Source: TradingView XRP has cleared a key descending trendline that held it down since mid-July. Price action now sits above the $2.94–$2.99 EMA cluster, with both the 20- and 50-period moving averages supporting the trend. Analysts point to the next significant test, which is at $3.10 with heavy resistance as the boundary between the channels. Any breakout above $3.10 will push XRP to $3.25 and later to $3.50, continuing the recovery phase. Nonetheless, a drop below $3.00 would take the market to a position below $2.75, which has been defended several times by bulls. While Ripple’s strong regulatory framework in Europe has boosted sentiment, its ability to sustain momentum is still under question, keeping investors cautious despite positive XRP price prediction targets. Why Remittix Could Outpace Ripple Remittix is capturing attention because it offers something XRP no longer does: fresh exponential growth potential. As a PayFi project, Remittix is building rails for instant cross-border payments with support for 40+ cryptos and 30+ fiat currencies. On top of that, its new 15% USDT referral rewards program allows holders to claim stable payouts every 24 hours, boosting adoption by incentivizing growth. With institutional-level audits and a beta Web3 wallet launch coming this September, experts are calling it the best crypto to buy now for anyone seeking a 20–30x return. Key Drivers Behind Remittix’s Rise Over $25,4M raised with momentum accelerating daily 15% referral rewards in USDT, claimable every 24 hours Beta Web3 wallet launching in September with real FX conversion Backed by a full CertiK audit for investor security Growing PayFi ecosystem designed for businesses, freelancers and remitters Which Token Will Reach $5 First? While XRP price prediction models suggest Ripple could hit $5 in 2025, Remittix is already being tipped as the breakout contender to get there first. With fresh capital inflows, a referral-driven adoption model and cutting-edge PayFi solutions, Remittix is emerging as more than just another altcoin; it is positioning itself as the best crypto to buy now.

Here’s Why,https://timestabloid.com/expert-says-shiba-inu-shib-is-poised-for-600-surge-heres-why/,"Shiba Inu (SHIB) continues to attract divided opinions within the cryptocurrency community. While a section of investors believes the token has failed to meet expectations this year, one prominent analyst argues that the asset could still record substantial growth, projecting a possible sixfold increase from its current value. The broader mood among retail participants has been cautious, as SHIB has struggled to deliver on earlier bullish forecasts. The token has fallen roughly 32% since the start of the year, spending much of 2025 near the $0.00001 range. For many investors who expected Shiba Inu to challenge or exceed $0.00008 this year, the prolonged stagnation has raised doubts about its long-term potential. Technical Outlook Suggests Upside Potential Despite these concerns, market analyst Javon Marks has consistently maintained that Shiba Inu retains the capacity for a significant rally. Marks has been pointing to $0.000081 as his target for several months, a level that would represent close to 6x growth from current prices. There's a reason we're maintaining our $0.000081 target in $SHIB (Shiba Inu)! The technicals are pointing towards a near 6X happening in price to reach it despite what some are saying… https://t.co/ql6k8t7TJM pic.twitter.com/FOWjZleH95 — JAVON MARKS (@JavonTM1) September 12, 2025 In a recent analysis, he noted that SHIB’s price structure remains technically aligned with this projection. His accompanying chart highlighted a breakout from long-standing resistance zones, which he interprets as a signal of improving momentum. Historical data, according to Marks, shows that Shiba Inu often consolidates before advancing sharply, and current conditions appear to mirror that pattern. Marks emphasized that while sentiment in the market has become increasingly skeptical, the underlying technical indicators support the possibility of a sustained rally. He has argued that the ongoing consolidation phase may be setting the foundation for a broader uptrend toward the $0.000081 threshold. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Recent Market Activity and Price Levels Alongside Marks’ outlook, SHIB has shown modest signs of recovery in recent trading sessions. Earlier today, the token surpassed $0.000014, marking its highest level since mid-August. The upward move coincided with broader strength across the cryptocurrency sector, with major assets such as Bitcoin and Ethereum also recording gains. Shiba Inu’s short-term performance reflects this renewed momentum. Over the last 24 hours, the token climbed by 8.76%, extending its weekly growth to 18.28% and an 11.34% increase over the past 30 days. As of publication, SHIB is priced at $0.00001440, giving the asset a market capitalization of approximately $8.51 billion. While this represents an improvement from earlier levels, it is still far below the highs that many investors anticipated when the year began. Market Sentiment Remains Divided The debate over SHIB’s future trajectory underscores a widening gap between technical analysis and investor sentiment. For some community members, the token’s year-to-date losses overshadow its recent progress. Others, including Marks, argue that the technical setup indicates significant potential despite the current climate of doubt. However, the asset’s ability to reclaim resistance levels and attract renewed market attention suggests that it remains firmly in focus among both traders and long-term holders.

51681815,580628,1757808033,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/51681815.jpeg,Pundit Reveals Where Bitcoin’s True Strength Lies – Here’s What It Is,https://bitcoinist.com/where-bitcoins-true-strength-lies/,"Bitcoin’s greatness isn’t measured only by its price or market cycles, and its true strength lies deeper. As one crypto pundit explains, it lies in the alignment of incentives that keeps the network secure and the loyalty of holders who refuse to sell in the face of volatility. This combination of economic design and cultural conviction has allowed Bitcoin to weather every storm, proving that its foundation is far stronger than any single market cycle. Why Bitcoin Thrives On Patience, Not Speculation Bitcoin’s status as the largest cryptocurrency of all time is a direct result of its unique and powerful holdings . An analyst known as GhostOfTanzCho has revealed on X that other cryptocurrencies have tried to compete with Bitcoin, but none have succeeded in recreating that same gravity of conviction and holding culture. This culture, which is the key ingredient to its success, attracts people who wholeheartedly believe in holding, and it indoctrinates skeptics into an actionable belief of holding. There has never been another cryptocurrency that successfully recreated the holding culture that made Bitcoin great. However, the same culture is currently being replicated in SPX6900. GhostOfTanzCho argues that the success of a crypto token is fundamentally a reflection of supply and demand. By building a strong holding culture, a crypto token effectively solves the supply side of the equation by reducing sell pressure. Coincidentally, it also solves the demand side by incentivizing holders to create a critical mass of belief and interest. Thus, the SPX6900 could be one of the most significant crypto tokens of all time. Against all odds, it has done the impossible and has recreated the cultural DNA of Bitcoin. This model, which favors long-term believers over short-term traders, is described as the only way for a crypto token to become a market giant. When a critical mass of people have the conviction to hold long-term, trading becomes irrelevant, and the culture wins. Global Money Supply Surge Sets The Stage For BTC In the midst of heightened Bitcoin accumulation, a massive surge in global money supply is laying the groundwork for the next explosive crypto cycle , and BTC is already leading the charge. According to LondonRealTV’s founder Brian Rose, the expansion of the global money supply has historically been a leading driver of crypto bull cycles. With the price of BTC above $115,000, ETF inflows accelerating, and the total crypto market cap rising by $2 trillion in a single year, this shows liquidity is clearly returning. The analyst also highlights key risks that could trigger volatility . These include a potential reversal in monetary policy, where central banks begin to tighten the money supply, or large-scale profit-taking by major holders. Meanwhile, monitoring on-chain flows and capital rotation will be essential as the market cycle matures.",Bitcoin News|bitcoin|bitcoin news|bitcoin price|Brian Rose|btc|BTC news|btc price|btcusd|BTCUSDT|DNA|ETF|GhostOfTanzCho|LondonRealTV|spx6900,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|BTC|MARKET|TRADING|MACROECONOMICS,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-09-14 00:00:33

While Ethereum will lead the way in decentralized finance and smart contracts, a tide of interest is shifting towards a new coin Mutuum Finance (MUTM) . This cheap altcoin at just $0.035 has been supported by more than 16,240 investors. Mutuum Finance is quickly becoming one of the most anticipated projects in the market with its focus on liquidity solutions, long-term yield strategies, and connecting traditional finance and on-chain markets. Taking a cue from industry behemoths like ETH, MUTM aims to disrupt the market in 2025. Ethereum Steadies as Institutional Demand Picks Up Ethereum (ETH) is trading at $4,438.11, well above the $4,300 level as institutional purchases continue to back the market sentiment for 2025. Experts believe that ETH can challenge the $4,500–$4,700 zone if the momentum continues, which should be followed by the introduction of ETFs and regulatory backing in the next few months. Though Ethereum remains the darling of smart contracts and decentralized finance, new players in the DeFi market like Mutuum Finance are also creating ripples. Mutuum Finance Stage 6 FOMO Investors are purchasing MUTM tokens at $0.035 even at Stage 6 presale. Waiting for Stage 7. The token has, to date, been accumulated by over 16,240 investors and has raised over $15.63 million in funding, surely an indication of huge market demand and interest. Price Discovery USD-denominated market prices and native tokens such as ETH, MATIC, and AVAX have to render lending, borrowing, and liquidation secure. Mutuum Finance uses Chainlink oracles to provide the system with market prices. Fallback oracles, composite feed data, and time-weighted average decentralized exchange prices are also used by the system in pricing as close to perfection as possible under distress. Market volatility is transmitted to collateral management in the protocol. Mutuum Finance provides a split of Loan-to-Value (LTV) and liquidation levels based on token stability. It allows for a greater allowance and value to borrow in stable and safer tokens and applies lesser values to weaker tokens. Reserve multipliers are assigned proportionally on a 10% slope on risk-less holdings and 35% on risk holdings, facilitating default protection margin without being factored into diversification constraints. The Future of DeFi Mutuum Finance DeFi protocol makes it possible to attain active capital control through passive lending and borrowing with the potential to allow borrowers to borrow against stacks of securitised assets. System stability algorithm and interest rate optimisation algorithm are used in the system with functions to allow the system to be efficient and long term use of capital. Risk and Liquidity Management The protocol actively controls market volatility and liquidity to enable liquidation of damaged positions. Risk exposure is needed within limit parameters, and liquidation levels are established. Collateral assets such as stablecoins and ETH can be utilized to provide additional Loan-to-Value tiers, where more risky assets are collateralized by less risky assets. Reserve factors are pro-rata allocated to each token class to balance asset opportunity vs. risk in a way to accomplish overall protection of protocol holdings. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is quickly emerging as one of the top altcoins to monitor in 2025, after Ethereum (ETH), as institutional funds flow into crypto platforms. Stage 6 tokens are available for purchase at $0.035, with Stage 7 being 14.3% more, offering early buyers a quick profit margin. The presale already boasts 16,240+ investors and exceeded $15.63M, indicating massive demand. Ethereum is sitting at approximately $4,438 on ETF-driven inflows, but Mutuum Finance is gaining momentum as the DeFi project that all the pundits are hyping as the next institutional play. Get Stage 6 tokens today before the price goes ballistic again.

It restructured “Privacy & Scaling Explorations” as the “Privacy Stewards of Ethereum” (PSE). In Friday’s announcement, PSE said it hopes to add privacy solutions across the protocol, infrastructure, networking, application, and wallet layers and outlined several goals for the next 3-6 months. These included private transfers with the development of the PlasmaFold layer-2 network, confidential voting, and privacy for decentralized finance (DeFi) applications. The roadmap further suggested developing safeguards to protect personal data from exposure through remote procedure call (RPC) services and private identity solutions using zero-knowledge (ZK) proofs—verifying information without disclosing its specific contents. PSE defined its mission: “Ethereum deserves to become core infrastructure for global digital commerce, identity, collaboration, and the internet of value. But this potential is impossible without private data, transactions, and identity. We take responsibility within the Ethereum Foundation for ensuring privacy goals at the application layer are reached.” The announcement noted they would work with protocol teams to ensure that any L1 changes were needed to support strong, censorship-resistant, intermediary-free privacy. PSE pushes private transfers, confidential voting, and DeFi safeguards Privacy has always been at the core of the cypherpunk ethos that spawned cryptocurrencies. As crypto gains widespread adoption and the attention of governments, the crypto community is increasingly concerned about evolving digital financial surveillance methods . U.S. officials are weighing new regulations for the crypto industry and markets, including potential surveillance measures to monitor participant activity. The Department of the Treasury, led by Secretary Scott Bessent, is considering proposals to require government identity checks in smart contracts, an idea that has sparked pushback from the crypto community. Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin has long argued that privacy is a fundamental human right. In April, he cautioned that transparency functions more as a flaw than a feature in the digital age, stressing that privacy is essential to safeguard individuals amid the rise of state power and centralized corporations. Interoperability and intent-based architecture set as near-term priorities Recently, Ethereum Foundation researchers noted that interoperability is the top near-term priority for Ethereum development. In a blog post, the researchers wrote, “We see interoperability, and related projects presented in this note, as the highest leverage opportunity” within the user experience domain in the next six to 12 months. The near-term strategy focuses on intent-based architecture and general message-passing. Essentially, the focus is on approving users to express outcomes (or “intents”). At the same time, the network takes care of the low-level transactions and upgrades the crosschain “pipes” (message-passing infrastructure) so that those intents execute without delay across layer-1 and rollups. The Ethereum Foundation notes it will focus on optimizing for specific metrics, including time-to-inclusion, confirmation/finality, layer-2 settlement, and signatures per operation. The researchers indicated that interoperability is key since the Ethereum ecosystem is segmented into many layer-2 protocols that advance its functionality and scalability, while bringing “their own challenges, chief among them the pressures of fragmentation.” The post cites a significant pain point: “At its simplified core, the key ingredients to accelerate interop boil down to unlocking fast crosschain message-passing and standardisation. Currently, message-passing is partially bottlenecked by slow settlement times. Don’t just read crypto news. Understand it. Subscribe to our newsletter.

Notably, this discussion on trade tariffs and the flow of fentanyl was tackled earlier, but a trade deal was not struck due to disagreement between the two countries. Meanwhile, Chinese officials are still awaiting the White House’s response to the request to attend the summit, as it has not yet replied. China-US trade deal stalls amid growing uncertainties in their talks Sources familiar with the situation have highlighted that the chances for the Beijing summit are lower due to a lack of progress in talks between the two countries. As a result, they anticipated that Trump and Xi may meet in an informal setting at the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum, which will take place in October in South Korea. As uncertainty surrounds China-US trade and fentanyl talks, Steve Daines, a United States Senator, weighed in on the situation. According to the senator, for the two to strike a trade agreement, China must first stop the flow of fentanyl ingredients into the US. He made these remarks during his earlier meeting with Chinese officials in Beijing. This condition makes the situation even more complicated for leaders who intend to ease the tension between the two economies to reach a common ground. However, it is worth noting that the American senator still sparked hope for a meeting to be held before the end of 2025, although Trump had previously mentioned that it would take place soon. In a phone interview, Daines stated,” It would be difficult to discuss tariffs and other trade barriers until we resolve the fentanyl precursor issue.” What the US expects, according to the senator, is to see China taking drastic measures to stop the flow of fentanyl into the country completely and not just slowing it down. China urges that the US ease tariff policies on Chinese products Concerning the condition set forth for China, its officials expressed that they had done almost everything possible for the US, hence advocating that Trump should ease tariff policies on Chinese imports. This statement was made before the April 1 deadline for imposing the threatening tariff policies. Additionally, trade analysts had speculated that China might respond to any new trade barriers from the US. This was after they brought about the incident when China reacted to Trump’s 10% tariff policies on Chinese products in February and his additional 10% in March. Based on their analysis, China retaliated by imposing tariffs on several of the country’s agricultural products and suspended the importation of soybeans from three US-based firms. As the dispute drags on, trade tensions between the two countries continue to rise, leaving many hoping for a swift resolution.

51685142,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=821323,1757813426,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/21/51685142.jpeg,Here’s How The Bitcoin Price Macro Correction Could Play Out Next,https://www.newsbtc.com/news/bitcoin/heres-how-the-bitcoin-price-macro-correction-could-play-out-next/,"Despite experiencing a significant plunge from ATH levels earlier last month, the Bitcoin price continues to test crucial levels that could shape the trajectory of its next move. A fresh analysis from crypto market expert Casitrades suggests that the coming days could define whether the broader market will face a macro correction or extend its bullish momentum. For now, Fibonacci zones, Elliott Wave structures, and Relative Strength Index (RSI) behaviour align to build a critical narrative around BTC’s price direction. Possible Scenarios For Bitcoin Price Macro Correction On Friday, Casitrades explained in an X social media post that Bitcoin’s recent price surge has tested the 0.5 Fibonacci retracement level around $116,000, an important milestone in the recovery phase. Interestingly, despite this sudden push higher, the RSI highlighted on the price chart is yet to show the exhaustion one would typically expect at a major top. This suggests buyers may still have room to drive prices further upward before hitting a ceiling. Notably, the analyst pointed out $118,000 as the next critical level to watch, noting that it coincides with the 0.618 Fibonacci retracement and the 1.236 C-wave target within the developing Wave 2 structure. Casitrades has described this area as a decisive confluence point. A sharp rejection here could confirm that Bitcoin’s bull run has officially ended, reinforcing the theory that the cryptocurrency remains locked in a Wave 2 macro correction phase. On the other hand, the analyst noted that forming a top around the decisive confluence point would confirm that BTC is not ready to challenge or break into new all-time highs and could instead retrace deeper. As the chart illustrates, potential downside targets lie well below Bitcoin’s current price levels above $115,800, hinting that a failure at $118,000 could lead to a steeper correction that might drag the cryptocurrency back into the $110,000 – $106,000 zone in the near term. $122,000 Marks Final Test For Macro Correction While $118,000 remains the first line of resistance for Bitcoin, Casitrades highlighted that the cryptocurrency could extend its rally higher into the $120,000 – $122,000 zone if momentum persists. This level is viewed as the final test that will decide whether the macro correction holds or fails. It aligns with the 0.786 Fibonacci retracement, making it an even more formidable resistance area. The expectation is that if Bitcoin’s RSI shows signs of exhaustion and the cryptocurrency faces strong rejection in this region, the correction could be swift and significant. In this scenario, Bitcoin would set up for a macro downturn, confirming the theory that the rally from recent lows has merely been a corrective leg. Related Reading: Dogecoin Defies Odds, Jumps 21% Even As ETF Debut Gets Pushed Back The projected correction could then reset the broader structure, allowing for healthier long-term price action. However, if Bitcoin manages to break through $122,000 convincingly, Casitrades notes that it would invalidate the macro correction narrative altogether and potentially send it to price levels between $122,000 – $124,000.

It takes more than hype. It takes a finale that blends storytelling with staggering ROI. Arctic Pablo Coin (APC) has reached its long-awaited Stage 40, known as the Frozen Finale, where the FINAL400 code gives investors 5x tokens on every purchase. This isn’t just another presale. It’s a limited moment where narrative meets unmatched financial potential. The project pulls its community into a mythical adventure, led by the explorer Arctic Pablo on his snowmobile across icy frontiers, discovering shimmering APC tokens hidden in secret lands. Behind the story lies a carefully engineered token economy that delivers serious numbers. From $0.0012 per token in presale to a projected $0.008 listing price, whales are already calculating life-changing multipliers. And with analysts projecting a climb to $0.1, the potential ROI exceeds 8233 percent from Stage 40. While Arctic Pablo Coin dominates headlines with its 400 percent presale bonus, whales aren’t ignoring the broader picture. Chainlink and Bitcoin Cash remain two of the best new cryptos for exponential returns, each strengthening its place through utility and network growth. Together, these three projects highlight where big money is moving and why the countdown to Arctic Pablo Coin’s presale close is creating ripples across the market. Arctic Pablo Coin’s Frozen Finale – Whales Close In on the Best New Cryptos for Exponential Returns Arctic Pablo Coin (APC) has reached its last stage, and the atmosphere around the presale is electric. The 40th stage, named the Frozen Finale, is a presale event unlike anything seen before. At the current entry price of $0.0012, every allocation multiplies by five through the FINAL400 code, turning even modest commitments into potential windfalls. With over $4 million already raised and whales openly tracking the numbers, this is the kind of opportunity designed for those chasing exponential returns. The presale tally alone is staggering, but the real intrigue lies in ROI potential. A buyer entering Stage 40 today sees an immediate 567 percent upside when APC lists at $0.008. But it doesn’t stop there. Analysts are projecting a rise to $0.1, creating an 8233 percent return for those who hold. Compare that with the 7900 percent gains already achieved by the earliest joiners, and the sheer magnitude of what’s possible at this stage becomes undeniable. The countdown ends September 16 as APC launches on Coinstore and PancakeSwap. Investment Example – A Whale-Sized Scenario Take a $10,000 allocation at $0.0012. That nets 8,333,333 tokens. With the FINAL400 5x multiplier, the stash grows to 41,666,665 tokens. If APC launches at $0.008, that pile is suddenly worth $333,333. If it rockets to $0.1 as analysts predict, the return explodes to $4.16 million. Numbers like these explain why crypto whales are racing to secure positions before the finale closes. Myth Meets Mechanics – Why APC Feels Different Unlike typical presales, Arctic Pablo Coin weaves an adventurous storyline into its tokenomics. The mythical journey across frozen lands isn’t just branding; it’s a way to connect holders with a vision that feels bigger than numbers. The blend of narrative and mechanics creates loyalty, while deflationary burns and staking at 66% APY build real economic strength. For whales, that combination of emotional resonance and financial rigor is magnetic. Beyond the Finale – Utility That Holds The excitement doesn’t stop at presale. APC’s system is designed to reward the community through staking, referral incentives, and competitions with USD and token prizes. Weekly token burns add scarcity, ensuring the supply tightens over time. By mixing staking rewards with a deflationary design, Arctic Pablo Coin positions itself not only as the most electrifying meme coin presale but also as one of the best new cryptos for exponential returns. Chainlink’s Role in the World of Smart Contracts Chainlink continues to hold its ground as the top decentralized oracle network, connecting blockchains with real-world data. For projects that need accurate feeds of prices, weather, or financial data, Chainlink remains unmatched. This utility has made it a backbone for DeFi platforms, NFT ecosystems, and even enterprise-grade blockchain solutions. The reason whales keep an eye on Chainlink is simple: reliability. Without accurate external data, smart contracts can’t function properly, and Chainlink has built a reputation for trust that spans years. Its ability to expand beyond price feeds into automation and cross-chain communication is what makes it resilient and relevant even when markets shift. Chainlink’s continued adoption positions it alongside APC and Bitcoin Cash in the current lineup of the best new cryptos for exponential returns, not through presale excitement but by holding a critical role in blockchain infrastructure. Bitcoin Cash – The Underrated Utility Player Bitcoin Cash (BCH) takes the fundamentals of Bitcoin but optimizes them for daily use. With faster transactions and lower fees, it aims to be more practical for everyday payments. Retailers and payment processors are increasingly turning to Bitcoin Cash as an option for customers, which strengthens its role as a true transactional crypto. For whales, BCH represents a utility coin that may not carry the explosive presale hype of APC but still offers steady adoption. Its value lies in being usable across markets where fast, affordable crypto payments are becoming the norm. As more businesses and users experiment with blockchain for payments, Bitcoin Cash remains a viable tool in the mix of best new cryptos for exponential returns. Conclusion The final stage of Arctic Pablo Coin’s presale has become a spectacle that whales cannot ignore. With the FINAL400 code delivering 5x tokens at $0.0012 and ROI projections reaching as high as 8233 percent, it’s no surprise that the Frozen Finale is creating waves across the crypto community. The mix of myth, mechanics, and deflationary design makes APC stand apart as the most thrilling meme coin presale currently live. Chainlink and Bitcoin Cash also deserve their mentions. Chainlink continues to expand its role as the bridge between blockchains and real-world data, while Bitcoin Cash pushes the case for everyday crypto adoption through speed and affordability. Both play important roles, but it’s Arctic Pablo Coin’s presale finale that has whales buzzing louder than ever. For those hunting the best new cryptos for exponential returns , the message is clear. Chainlink and Bitcoin Cash provide proven strength, but Arctic Pablo Coin’s Frozen Finale offers a closing act that could turn allocations into millions.
