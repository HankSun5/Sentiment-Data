This surge in activity is a welcome change of pace after a slowdown earlier in the year due to market volatility influenced by Trump’s tariff policies. The week’s success is also proof of renewed investor appetite for tech, fintech, and crypto-related listings. Klarna, Figure, and Gemini led the charge Some of the notable IPOs involved Klarna, Figure , Gemini, Legence, Black Rock Coffee Bar, and Via Transportation. Among the newcomers are significant players in various sectors, showcasing a diverse range of industries entering the public market. The lineup was much broader than expected, spanning industries and testing the waters for a potential fall IPO boom. Among the six IPOs, five were worth at least $290 million, priced above their marketed ranges. However, their performances post-listing have not been as positive. Nevertheless, Wall Street analysts have called this a sign of healthy skepticism among investors, which they say bodes well for the market going forward. Klarna has since inched toward its offering price, while Figure Technology Solutions Inc. ended its second day of trading near a high hit in the opening minutes of its debut. Among the four listings from Friday, Gemini Space Station Inc. has soared, while Blackstone-backed Legence Corp. and Via Transportation Inc. have been left with at best modest gains after opening below their IPO prices. This week’s set of deals is being considered as a gauge for how active the stock market is getting, and the results are mixed. All the IPOs witnessed strong demand in the formal marketing process before trading began, with many selling bigger stakes than they had initially offered. Despite rough starts, analysts claim things have been smooth compared to ailing deals from earlier this year that continue to struggle underwater. Experts expect the relative calm to entice more companies to go public, even though investors are still somewhat choosy over valuations and earnings. “Investor expectations remain high and continue to be demanding — profitability and fundamentals are huge,” said Mike Bellin, who leads PricewaterhouseCoopers’ IPO practice. “Some companies were very conservative with their prices because we’re still in an uncertain market.” Next week is expected to be equally active as Stubhub Holdings Inc., Netskope Inc., and others plan to go public. The group could raise up to $2.53 billion combined, and that would mark the first back-to-back weeks of such volumes in US IPOs that do not include SPACs, REITs, and closed-end funds since December 2021. The week’s activity is not permanent, analysts warn The US IPO market has had a strong start this month, but even with the welcome activity, the IPO market is still in recovery compared to pre-pandemic levels. There are those who don’t see the renewed activity as permanent either. Kati Penney, the corporate transactions lead at CrossCountry Consulting, is one of those who expect the market to dial back. She has tagged the week’s activity as an “anomaly” that can be linked to a return of large, well-known names whose processes were paused due to market volatility related to President Donald Trump’s chaotic tariff policies in April. The chaos kept several late-stage startups sidelined for months as investor demand for new deals soured. “We’ll see steady momentum but not at the pace of these past two weeks,” Penney said in an interview. “It also seems to be a bit more concentrated in some of these industries around technology — crypto, AI.” That was confirmed in the past week as the week’s largest deals came from Klarna and Figure, where both had investor orders for roughly 25 times more stock than was sold, according to Bloomberg News .

But when it comes to 2025, the quest for turning $100 into $1,000 is still to be fulfilled. Can the established meme coins like PEPE, Bonk Coin, and Shiba Inu, with their life changing history backing them, be the $1,000 contenders? But something is stirring the market: Layer Brett ($LBRETT) and its presale . Can it convert your $100 into $1,000? Layer Brett: Can its Presale make 10x your $100? Layer 2 isn’t slowing down — it’s gearing up to dominate, with estimates showing more than ten trillion dollars flowing through it annually by 2027. The push comes from a simple truth: crypto users want speed, affordability, and scale. Layer Brett isn’t here to play safe. It takes the raw power of Layer 2 infrastructure and fuses it with the chaos of meme culture. The result? Blazing-fast transactions, fees so tiny they barely register, and a staking system built to reward the bold. Early entrants can secure more than a staggering 700% APY. But the longer you wait, the smaller the payout — and the bigger the FOMO. With $LBRETT presale priced at just $0.0055 , this is the type of setup that latecomers will only dream about. Combine instant staking, a one million dollar prize pool, and true decentralization, and you’re looking at a project that experts say can convert your $100 to $1,000 before the next year. PEPE: A Meme’s Technical Takeover PEPE’s future looks very bright. The technical charts show a significant “golden cross” on its moving averages, which is supported by a clear breakout from a long-term trading range. This strong technical setup, combined with renewed interest from investors, means PEPE has the potential for a massive rally. A $100 investment in PEPE could reasonably see a 3x to 6x return, turning into $300 to $600. BONK’s Big Bark BONK is set for a major price jump this year. The charts show a powerful MAs golden cross, and it broke out of a long-term pattern. A $100 BONK investment could grow significantly. Some experts believe it could be $300 by the end of 2025. SHIB’s Next Leg Up SHIB is also poised for a significant rally through the end of 2025. A clear golden cross signals a major upward trend. This move is supported by a bullish flag pattern, with SHIB taking a short rest before a big jump. Some analysts predict a price increase of 3x to 4x, making your $100 become $300-$400. Best bet to make $1,000 PEPE, Bonk Coin, and Shiba Inu are all meme coins, and their hyped nature means that they can (and do) rise faster than the rest of the market. But 2 facts impact their predicted gains: First, all three meme coins have substantial market caps, making big gains difficult, if possible. Secondly, they are pure hypes, and everyone knows that meme coins, where they can rise, can also crash hard. Layer Brett ($LBRETT), however, has a small market cap and merges DeFi with meme coins, giving it a purpose that neither PEPE, Bonk Coin, nor SHIB has. If you want to convert your $100 into $1,000, Layer Brett is your best bet. The presale is on , and you can only make $1,000 if you join now.

51674128,https://invezz.com/?p=2880487,1757793600,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/69/default.png,"Solana ETF delayed again, but analysts highlight SOL and this hidden gem",https://invezz.com/news/2025/09/13/solana-etf-delayed-again-but-analysts-highlight-sol-and-this-hidden-gem/,"The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has once again delayed its decision on spot Solana ETFs, frustrating traders who had hoped for quicker progress. While many expected approval in September, the regulator has pushed the deadline further, citing the need for “additional review.” This move mirrors the repeated delays faced by Ethereum and XRP ETFs, signaling that the SEC is still cautious about giving green lights to altcoins beyond Bitcoin. Despite the regulatory setbacks, Solana’s market performance has remained strong. Trading near $225, SOL has held its ground, buoyed by consistent on-chain activity and continued developer adoption. Investors seem less concerned about the short-term delays and more focused on Solana’s longer-term trajectory as one of the most scalable Layer-1 blockchains in the industry. Amid this environment, retail traders are not only eyeing Solana but also looking at presales like MAGACOIN FINANCE, which offer early exposure and high-growth potential before broader exchange listings. Solana’s strength amid regulatory uncertainty Even without ETF approval, Solana has shown impressive resilience. Daily active addresses remain high, DeFi activity on the network continues to climb, and transaction speeds maintain their edge over most competitors. Solana’s ability to weather negative headlines reflects the growing maturity of its ecosystem. Whales appear to agree. On-chain trackers reveal that large wallets have been quietly accumulating SOL, viewing the delays as temporary rather than a deal-breaker. This steady accumulation has helped keep Solana above key support levels, giving confidence to retail investors watching from the sidelines. MAGACOIN FINANCE in the spotlight before listings Limited allocations left – MAGACOIN FINANCE’s current presale tier nearly oversubscribed. Analysts argue this is one of the strongest indicators of retail demand in the presale market. The project’s rapid growth reflects both strong community engagement and institutional-style interest, as whales have started participating in recent weeks. The appeal of MAGACOIN FINANCE lies in its positioning as a hybrid: it captures the viral momentum typical of meme coins while pairing it with a structured roadmap, audited contracts, and real ecosystem goals. For traders wary of regulatory delays on major tokens like Solana, MAGACOIN FINANCE offers an alternative – a ground-floor opportunity before mainstream exposure. Technical analysis for SOL On the charts, Solana has strong support near $200, with additional layers around $180. Resistance sits at $250, followed by $290. A breakout above $250 could accelerate momentum, opening the door to $290 as the next target. Conversely, failure to hold above $200 may trigger a pullback to $180 or even lower. Momentum indicators remain supportive, with RSI readings showing that SOL is not yet overbought. Trading volumes have held steady, further reinforcing confidence in the asset’s stability despite ETF delays. Institutional outlook While the SEC has postponed decisions, analysts point out that institutional interest in Solana is real. Asset managers view SOL as one of the most compelling alternatives to Ethereum for scaling, DeFi, and consumer-facing apps. Once ETF approval eventually arrives, the potential for significant inflows remains high. For now, traders see the delays as opportunities to accumulate before a longer-term breakout. Broader market trends Bitcoin’s stability above $114,000 and Ethereum’s consolidation have created a supportive backdrop for altcoins. The “altseason index” has been rising steadily, indicating that traders are rotating capital into alternative Layer-1 tokens. Solana, Cardano, and emerging presales like MAGACOIN FINANCE are among the biggest beneficiaries of this trend. Global macroeconomic conditions also support the case for risk assets. With the Federal Reserve expected to cut rates this month, liquidity is increasing across markets, which typically benefits both equities and crypto. Conclusion Solana’s latest ETF delay may frustrate traders, but it hasn’t derailed the network’s momentum. With strong on-chain activity, steady whale accumulation, and a resilient price above $200, SOL remains one of the top altcoins to watch heading into October. At the same time, presale projects like MAGACOIN FINANCE are capturing unprecedented demand, with its current tier nearly oversubscribed. Together, SOL and MAGACOIN FINANCE showcase two sides of the altcoin opportunity: one established, the other emerging, both with high potential as the bull market unfolds.

Mutuum Finance stands at Stage 6 of presale and has set the token at $0.035. Stage 7 is a 14.29% increase to $0.04. The campaign has reached more than $15.63 million and more than 16,240+ investors have invested to date. Given SHIB has had a strong community presence, institutional investors are closely monitoring the momentum of MUTM as a vehicle to ride the next crypto bull run. Shiba Inu (SHIB) Status Update SHIB trades at $0.00001317 as of now. Shiba Inu has been trending sideways in recent times, its price fluctuating between $0.0000129 and $0.0000132, showing marginal gains but also points of resistance. While developments in the ecosystem like Shibarium and token burns remain in the cards, overall momentum remains cautious, and whales and investors await better clues. While SHIB remains on this stage, new DeFi-projects like Mutuum Finance are starting to garner investor interest. Official Bug Bounty Program Mutuum Finance and CertiK have established an official Bug Bounty Program with the $50,000 USDT bounty for white-hat hackers to help discover bugs in the project codebase. The program focuses on potential issues on four levels of severity: critical, major, minor, and low. Its objectives are to enhance security, protect investors, and protect users on the platform. Interest and Liquidity Models The project utilizes a dynamic interest rate model to keep the liquidity of the platform in equilibrium. Low interest rates cause individuals to borrow more if money borrowed is in high demand. Individuals will pay a premium and introduce more funds into the system if interest levels are low. Fixed interest rates can also be applied to borrowing, which is larger than floating but re-negotiable every time there are fluctuations in the conditions of the market. Fixed interest rates are only utilized in highly liquid assets. Mutuum Finance is decentralized and MUTM holders are in control. Borrowers have freedom, and system interest rate design ensures long-term sustainability and efficiency. The design also allows for automatic diversification of purchases, and the platform is therefore sustainable and responsive in the DeFi economy. Price Discovery Correct price data must be present so that borrowing, lending, and liquidation can be secure. Mutuum Finance uses Chainlink oracles to supply the system with USD and native token market prices such as ETH, MATIC, and AVAX. The system relies on fallback oracles, combined feed, and time-weighted average decentralized exchange prices to keep valuations as precise in stress market conditions. Lending: Dual-Layer Lending Framework The project’s double-lending mechanism offers consumers a balance between borrowing Peer-to-Peer lending (P2P) or lending directly from smart contracts (P2C) The P2C mechanism involves smart contracts constantly monitoring markets to receive maximum interest payment so that the borrowers can lend sensibly directly with the automatic payment of interest to investors. P2P platform gives the lender and the borrower a chance to negotiate between themselves independently without relying on any middleman, thus providing freedom and autonomy on the platform. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is becoming one of the top whales’ targets for the next major bull run ride. Stage 6 tokens are priced at $0.035, while Stage 7 price will rise by 14.29% to $0.04. The project has already collected $15.63M and attracted 16,240+ investors with strong early traction. As SHIB is consolidating at $0.00001317, whales are entering MUTM for higher upside. Purchase Stage 6 tokens now before the next price hike.

51672843,580605,1757793640,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png,Here’s What The New XRP Ledger Updates By Developers Mean For Investors,https://bitcoinist.com/the-new-xrp-ledger-updates/,"Developers are getting ready to introduce a major security update on the XRP Ledger (XRPL) that could enhance investor protection. Known as XLS-86 Firewall , the amendment is designed to block scams and stop the loss of XRP tokens from wallets—a long-awaited safeguard for a community that has endured heavy losses in the past. How The New XRP Ledger Update Will Protect Investors The XRP Ledger is preparing to roll out one of its most significant security-focused updates, known as the XLS-86 Firewall. Announced by a dUNL Validator identified as ‘Vet’ on X social media, the proposal aims to provide a safeguard against the increasing number of scams targeting XRP holders . At its core, the amendment is created to give investors greater control over how their transactions are executed, limiting the chances of bad actors draining their wallets . The firewall will allow account owners to impose customized restrictions on outgoing transactions, including time-based limits and value-based thresholds. This means that even if an attacker manages to gain access to a private key, they cannot instantly withdraw funds from the account. Instead, these restrictions buy valuable time for the legitimate owner to react and secure their holdings. Another vital component of the amendment is the “whitelist” mechanism. With this feature, investors can authorize a list of trusted accounts that are exempt from firewall restrictions, ensuring that daily transactions are not disrupted. This design balances security with usability, giving users confidence that their systems are protected without adding unnecessary friction to daily workflows. Notably, activation of the firewall is left to the user’s discretion, allowing them to tailor security to their needs and risk tolerance. For retail investors and small enterprises, the upgrade offers a critical advantage by providing an extra layer of protection against scam attacks . Traditionally, multisignature protection has been touted as a robust security layer; however, it remains complicated for the average user to implement. By contrast, the upcoming XRPL firewall offers a more accessible solution that complements existing transaction flows. Its simplicity and promised defense against unauthorized transfers make it a potentially game-changing new security upgrade for XRP holders. Why XRPL Needed A Firewall Security Upgrade The development of the XLS-86 Firewall did not arise independently but as a response to persistent and growing threats against the XRP community . Over the years, malicious actors have repeatedly exploited unsuspecting investors, employing tactics that range from phishing campaigns to impersonation scams. Just recently, the CTO of Ripple, David Schwartz, flagged a fake airdrop scheme that could have inflicted serious losses on unsuspecting investors had it gone unnoticed. Currently, the XRP Ledger does not provide any built-in safeguards to stop a compromised account from being drained instantly. However, with the development of the new firewall upgrade, XRP investors will be allowed to set protective rules that delay or restrict suspicious outgoing transfers, reducing the likelihood of catastrophic financial losses while still giving them full custody of their funds.",XRP|David Schwartz|dUNL Validator|ripple|XLS-86 Firewall|XRP Ledger|XRP news|XRP price|XRPL|XRPUSD|XRPUSDT,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|XRP|BUSINESS|WALLET|AIRDROP,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-09-13 20:00:40

The survey collected responses from 111 out of 190 Guild members and found that most are earning 50% to 60% less than their peers in similar roles. Compensation Gap Median salaries for surveyed Ethereum developers came in at about $140,000, compared with offers averaging $300,000 at rival projects. The report also detailed pay by area of focus, with average salaries at $130,000 for client developers, $215,000 for researchers, and $130,000 for coordination roles. Additionally, these contributors said that they don’t get any equity or token exposure from their employers. The general allocation was $0, with only 37% of respondents receiving anything. On the other hand, final-stage offers made to their peers at rival organizations in the past year included a median equity or token share of 6.5%. This ranges from cofounder-level allocations of 10% to 30% to early employee grants of 0.1% to 3%. The gap has created pressure; almost 40% of respondents have received outside job offers in the past year. In total, 108 were disclosed across 42 individuals, with the average package reaching $359,000. Some developers said they had been offered as much as $700,000 to move elsewhere. Closing the Pay Disparity Established in 2022, Protocol Guild has become a lifeline for such developers. Backed by the “1% Pledge” from projects including EigenLayer, Ether.fi, Taiko, and Puffer, the group has distributed over $33 million since launch. VanEck also pledged 10% of profits from its spot Ether ETF to the initiative in 2023. Over the last 12 months, the average Guild member received $66,000 through this funding, while the median distribution was $74,285. That support represented nearly one-third of total annual compensation for many employees, with the mean pay rising from $140,000 to $207,121. Survey responses show how important this extra support has been, with 59% of participants rating Guild funding as “very” or “extremely important” to their ability to keep working on Ethereum. The network has secured nearly $1 trillion in value, serves millions of users, and powers thousands of applications reliant on key upgrades. Protocol Guild warned that inadequate compensation puts Ethereum at risk by undermining developer retention, slowing progress on the roadmap, and threatening long-term neutrality. The group also emphasized that aligning pay with market rates is important to keep talent in place and ensure the ecosystem’s future growth.

In that episode, titled “Frinkcoin,” Professor Frink invents a digital currency that skyrockets in popularity, catapulting him to sudden wealth. Amelie highlights this storyline as more than simple satire, arguing that it reflects a long-planned financial transformation in which XRP now sits at the heart. From Satire to Symbolism For decades, The Simpsons has been celebrated for comedy that occasionally mirrors real-world developments, from smartwatches to political events. “Frinkcoin,” which aired on February 23, 2020, offered a humorous but surprisingly detailed look at cryptocurrency’s potential to reshape money and power. Amelie suggests the episode’s portrayal of a breakthrough digital asset prefigures today’s growing institutional embrace of blockchain technology. While the cartoon is fiction, its depiction of rapid adoption and cultural upheaval resonates with current debates around XRP’s role in the next phase of global finance. The Simpsons told us again It’s all planned for a long time… and #XRP is right in the center of it! pic.twitter.com/83O85EGBHK — 𝓐𝓶𝓮𝓵𝓲𝓮 (@_Crypto_Barbie) September 13, 2025 The Legal Backdrop Beyond cultural references, XRP’s real-world journey has been shaped by a high-stakes legal battle. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission sued Ripple Labs in 2020, alleging that XRP was sold as an unregistered security. After years of courtroom sparring, the case effectively ended in late June 2025. Judge Analisa Torres rejected earlier settlement proposals but ultimately approved the mutual withdrawal of all appeals, closing the chapter on one of the crypto industry’s longest regulatory fights. Ripple confirmed on June 27 that it had dropped its counter-appeal, and the SEC is no longer pursuing its own. This final resolution removed a major cloud over XRP’s future and cleared the way for broader institutional participation. Market Momentum and ETF Prospects With legal uncertainty lifted, attention has shifted to potential exchange-traded funds (ETFs) that could give investors regulated exposure to XRP. Several asset managers are reportedly preparing filings for spot-market products , following the path that Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs have already begun to carve. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Approval of an XRP-linked ETF would represent a major milestone , unlocking new liquidity channels and lending further credibility to the asset that once faced heavy regulatory scrutiny. Culture Meets Capital Amelie’s argument is not that The Simpsons literally predicted XRP’s rise, but that popular culture can foreshadow technological and economic change. The “Frinkcoin” episode captured how innovation and public enthusiasm can collide to create seismic market shifts long before traditional institutions react. XRP’s evolving story—legal vindication, growing institutional interest, and a community attuned to cultural signals—illustrates how narrative and regulation can converge to influence financial reality. Amelie’s post invites readers to view XRP through a wider cultural lens. Whether or not one believes The Simpsons offered a roadmap, the parallels underscore how ideas once dismissed as entertainment can reflect genuine economic trends. With the SEC case closed and ETF speculation building, XRP stands at a pivotal moment where popular narrative and market fundamentals intersect—just as a satirical cartoon imagined years ago.

In his assessment, Wedson pointed out that this level was one of the points where the market tended to slow down or form local peaks in the past. “Any price above $117,000 enters a zone of strong interest and indecision. Therefore, a clear break above $118,000 would be a sign of strength,” Wedson said.

Walker, who reported directly to AI chief John Giannandrea, used to be in charge of Siri until recently. He changed roles earlier this year to lead Apple’s Answers team after a major reshuffling, which some attribute to the challenges Apple was facing with rolling out Apple Intelligence . Oversight of Siri was transferred to software engineering head Craig Federighi after promised improvements to the assistant were delayed. A future release now in question Walker was reportedly moved on to oversee the development of a new AI-powered web search tool similar to products from Perplexity and ChatGPT. The search project is scheduled for release in 2026, but with his impending exit, the timeline for that launch may be called into question. Walker was known internally as a defender of Siri’s long-term potential. In a March internal meeting, he likened Apple’s work on AI to “swimming hundreds of miles” only to be criticized for “not getting to Hawaii,” acknowledging delays but insisting progress was significant. An exodus of AI talent Walker’s exit follows a string of high-profile departures from Apple’s AI division. Ruoming Pang, who led Apple’s AI models team, left for Meta earlier this year, with several engineers and researchers following him. Frank Chu, another senior figure who was working in the search services team, has also moved to Meta. This talent flight has intensified concerns about Apple’s ability to retain top AI talent at a time when rivals, including Google, Meta, and Microsoft, are racing ahead with advanced generative AI products. The defections risk hollowing out Apple’s institutional expertise just as demand for generative AI capabilities in consumer hardware accelerates. The departures come as Apple’s AI strategy faces heat from investors and consumers. The company unveiled its “Apple Intelligence” suite of features earlier this year, integrating large language models into the iPhone and Mac. What’s next for Apple? Critics point out that Siri, launched in 2011, has failed to capitalize on a technology it pioneered more than a decade ago, and now it’s lagging behind in the race for AI leadership. The development of Apple’s own AI-powered search system was welcomed with enthusiasm, especially by its ecosystem, as it was seen as the next major step for the tech giant. Its debut, however, may now be delayed under new leadership. Despite the recent challenges, some investors remain optimistic about Apple’s chances of turning the tide around.

Layer Brett, a next-generation meme coin with real utility, has surpassed $3.5 million in its presale , fusing viral culture with essential blockchain scalability. Layer Brett: New meme coin season Layer Brett stands out by offering a solution to common Ethereum Layer 1 challenges, namely slow transactions and expensive gas fees. Layer Brett processes up to 10,000 transactions per second (TPS)—with gas fees that go down as much as $0.0001. This innovative approach gives $LBRETT a significant edge in a market hungry for efficient, low-cost alternatives. It truly bridges meme power with real speed and utility. Layer Brett aims to disrupt the meme token landscape by offering high-speed, low-cost transactions, significant staking rewards, and a vibrant community ecosystem. $LBRETT operates transactions off-chain to reduce congestion on the mainnet, while still anchoring to Ethereum for security. This mechanism unlocks throughput, compresses fees, and shrinks wait times, enabling near-instant transactions and dramatically reduced gas costs compared to Ethereum’s $10–$20 fees. By leveraging this efficiency, Layer Brett can provide significantly higher staking rewards, ensuring users get more for their efforts. A clear path for XRP XRP is positioned for a big move. The XRP news shows its price has broken out of a long-term symmetrical triangle pattern, signaling that a major accumulation phase is over. With XRP news about new institutional interest and potential for an ETF, a strong rally is imminent ADA’s researched-backed rally Cardano is a unique blockchain focused on security and sustainability, utilizing its peer-reviewed Ouroboros protocol. Its ongoing upgrades are designed to enhance ADA’s performance. When it comes to Cardano price prediction, technical analysis supports a powerful rally for ADA for the rest of 2025. A recent breakout from a multi-year consolidation pattern signals a new uptrend. ADA price is expected to rise significantly as its ecosystem expands. But given the large market cap, ADA will need to push really hard to make any major gains. Layer Brett: sparking meme rally Bringing utility to memes, Layer Brett is set to lead the meme coin rally. DeFi functionality makes $LBRETT larger than life, with potential to outpace other meme giants. The $LBRETT presale is ongoing at $0.0055 per token , offering early entrants a chance to earn more than 700% APY through instant staking. This low entry price, combined with high yields and a $1 million giveaway, attracts significant interest. DeFi functionality is nothing without efficiency, and here is where the ETH Layer 2 steps in. Building off its security, Layer Brett is completely decentralized, and offers anonymity, with no KYC requirements, and governance options. The experts’ verdict: Layer Brett can do 100x in 2026, beating even XRP and the best of ADA. Get it while it’s hot! Layer Brett is still in its presale for $0.0055 , but not for long. Early backers are positioned for significant rewards through staking and dynamic ecosystem incentives. This Layer 2 crypto offers a unique blend of fun and function, distinguishing itself from utility-free origins. Now’s your chance to be part of the Layer Brett movement.

Exxon’s announcement hands a boost to the electric vehicle industry as it becomes a supplier of a new synthetic material capable of solving critical challenges in the industry From oil to EV materials Exxon Mobil Corp. is making a big splash in the electric vehicle (EV) supply industry with the announcement of a synthetic graphite material that it claims can extend EV battery life by up to 30%. The company’s Chief Executive Officer, Darren Woods, unveiled the innovation on Friday at the University of Texas at Austin’s Energy Symposium, describing it as a “revolutionary step change in battery performance.” Exxon said that the new carbon molecule is already being tested by several EV manufacturers. This material could allow for faster charging, longer lifespans, and extended driving ranges in electric vehicles. Exxon intends to secure its supply chain and has already acquired production assets from Chicago-based Superior Graphite earlier this week. The company plans to scale up manufacturing of the material and is aiming for commercial production by 2029. Exxon insists that it does not intend to become a battery maker, but the company sees this as an opportunity to leverage its network of refineries, chemical plants, and research laboratories to support the development of clean energy. “We don’t do wind and solar, we have no issues with wind and solar, but we don’t have capability in that space,” Woods said . “But we do have capability of transforming molecules and there are enormous opportunities in that space to use hydrogen and carbon molecules to meet the growing demand.” The company has hinted at plans to enter the lithium extraction business as well. The company has a history in the industry. It invented the lithium-ion battery in the 1970s, produced the plastic film for the first rechargeable version in 1991, and developed new separator materials for batteries nearly two decades ago. Exxon backtracking on its hydrogen ambitions Exxon’s inclusion of hydrogen as part of its energy transition strategy began around 2018–2021, but the company has had research ties to hydrogen going back at least to the early 2000s. The company has warned that its planned low-carbon hydrogen and ammonia project in Baytown, Texas, may face delays due to weak customer demand. The regulatory environment is also currently a hindrance to the company’s plans. Woods stated that the shortened timeframe for claiming hydrogen tax credits under President Donald Trump’s “ Big Beautiful Bill ” could slow the market’s development. “Our big concern today around low-carbon hydrogen is whether there’s enough time within that bill to incentivize the development of the market,” Woods said. “We can’t do it on charity.” KEY Difference Wire helps crypto brands break through and dominate headlines fast",Tech|Exxon,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|MARKET|REGULATION|RESEARCH|BUSINESS|COMMODITY,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-09-13 20:50:15

The cryptocurrency world is always buzzing with activity, and few events capture attention quite like a substantial movement of digital assets. Recently, the crypto community observed a truly remarkable event: a USDT whale transfer involving a staggering sum. This transaction, valued at approximately $207 million, saw 206,964,406 USDT move from the OKX exchange to an undisclosed wallet address. Such a significant shift often sparks questions and speculation among investors and market watchers alike. What Exactly Happened in This USDT Whale Transfer? Blockchain tracking service Whale Alert was the first to report this massive transaction. The data clearly showed 206,964,406 Tether (USDT) departing from a known OKX wallet. This substantial amount then landed in an address classified as ‘unknown’ – meaning it’s not publicly linked to an exchange or a known institutional entity. A USDT whale transfer refers to the movement of a very large quantity of a stablecoin, in this case, Tether (USDT), by a single entity or group. These entities, often called ‘whales,’ hold enough cryptocurrency to potentially influence market prices. USDT, being a stablecoin pegged to the US dollar, is frequently used for large-scale transfers due to its stability and ease of movement between exchanges. Understanding these transfers is crucial for grasping the underlying currents of the crypto market. While the specifics of the recipient remain a mystery, the sheer volume of this transaction warrants closer examination. Why Do Such Massive USDT Whale Transfers Matter? Large transfers like this USDT whale transfer can have several implications for the broader cryptocurrency ecosystem. Firstly, they can signal a shift in market sentiment. A whale moving funds off an exchange might indicate an intention to hold long-term, suggesting confidence in future price appreciation. Conversely, moving funds to an exchange could precede a large selling order, potentially impacting market prices. Moreover, such transfers affect liquidity. When a significant amount of a stablecoin like USDT moves, it can influence the available liquidity on exchanges, which in turn affects trading pairs and overall market stability. For instance, if the funds are being prepared for a large purchase of another cryptocurrency, it could signal an upcoming upward price movement for that asset. The anonymity of the receiving wallet also adds a layer of intrigue. While blockchain technology provides transparency regarding transactions, the identity behind the wallet address often remains private. This balance between transparency and privacy is a fundamental aspect of the crypto world. Who Could Be Behind This Significant USDT Whale Transfer? Identifying the exact entity behind a large USDT whale transfer is challenging due to the pseudonymous nature of blockchain addresses. However, market analysts often consider several possibilities. It could be an institutional investor making a strategic move, perhaps rebalancing a portfolio or preparing for a major investment in another digital asset. Another common scenario involves exchanges themselves. They often move large sums of crypto between their hot and cold wallets for security reasons or to manage liquidity. While the transaction originated from OKX, the destination being an ‘unknown wallet’ suggests it’s likely not an internal exchange transfer to another of their known addresses. Alternatively, a high-net-worth individual or a large decentralized finance (DeFi) protocol could be behind the move. Regardless of the identity, the scale of this transaction positions the recipient as a significant player in the crypto space, capable of influencing market dynamics. How Should Investors React to a Large USDT Whale Transfer? For everyday investors, observing a large USDT whale transfer should primarily serve as an informational cue rather than an immediate call to action. It is crucial to avoid panic or making impulsive decisions based solely on such news. Instead, consider these actionable insights: Monitor Market Trends: Keep an eye on the overall market sentiment and any subsequent price movements of major cryptocurrencies. Large stablecoin transfers can sometimes precede significant price action. Understand the Context: While a transfer is notable, it’s just one piece of a larger puzzle. Look for other market indicators, news, and analysis to form a comprehensive view. Diversify Your Portfolio: Relying too heavily on one asset or reacting to every large transaction can be risky. A diversified portfolio helps mitigate the impact of individual market events. Conduct Your Own Research: Always verify information and understand the fundamentals of the assets you invest in. Do not solely depend on whale movements as a trading signal. In conclusion, the recent USDT whale transfer from OKX to an unknown wallet is a powerful reminder of the dynamic and often opaque nature of the cryptocurrency market. While the exact motives behind such a colossal move remain shrouded in mystery, it highlights the significant capital flowing within the digital asset space. For investors, it underscores the importance of staying informed, understanding market mechanics, and making well-researched decisions rather than reacting to every large transaction. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) What is a crypto whale? A crypto whale is an individual or entity that holds a very large amount of a particular cryptocurrency. Their substantial holdings mean their transactions can significantly impact market prices and liquidity. What is USDT (Tether)? USDT is a stablecoin, a type of cryptocurrency designed to maintain a stable value, typically pegged to a fiat currency like the US dollar. It’s widely used for trading, lending, and transferring value across the crypto ecosystem due to its stability. Why are large USDT transfers significant? Large USDT transfers are significant because they can indicate major shifts in market sentiment, potential liquidity changes on exchanges, or preparation for large purchases or sales of other cryptocurrencies. They often reflect the actions of major market players. Can the recipient of an unknown wallet transfer be identified? While blockchain transactions are public, the identity behind a wallet address is usually pseudonymous. Unless the wallet owner voluntarily reveals their identity or links it to a regulated entity, identifying them directly from the blockchain is very difficult. Should I change my investment strategy based on a whale transfer? It’s generally not advisable to change your entire investment strategy based on a single whale transfer. While such events are informative, they are just one data point. It’s better to combine this information with broader market analysis, fundamental research, and your personal financial goals.

As the market matures, a growing number of analysts are arguing that Ruvi AI (RUVI) has become a no-brainer investment choice over established utility tokens like Ripple (XRP). With a 100x forecast gaining credibility and daily token sales continuing at a pace of millions, Ruvi AI is rapidly solidifying its position as a project on the verge of a major breakout. This confident outlook is fueled by a presale that is nothing short of sensational. The Ruvi AI presale is rocketing towards the $3.6 million fundraising milestone, a clear signal of immense market conviction. A fast-growing global community of over 3,500 holders has already acquired more than 265 million RUVI tokens . This intense buying pressure, which sees millions of tokens sold daily, indicates that the 100x forecast might be nearing reality sooner than anyone expected. The Clear Advantage: Why Ruvi AI is a No-Brainer for 100x Gains The argument for choosing Ruvi AI over Ripple boils down to one simple factor: exponential growth potential. For Ripple, a 100x return from its current position is a mathematical near-impossibility due to its massive market capitalization. The window for life-changing gains has long since closed. Ruvi AI, however, presents the perfect formula for a 100x run. It combines a low initial market cap with powerful, real-world utility in the booming $104 billion creator economy . Its value is not based on speculation, but on its revolutionary super app designed to solve tangible problems for millions of users. This fundamental strength is what underpins its 100x potential and has been further validated by a successful smart contract audit from CyberScope and a prominent listing on CoinMarketCap . The Super App Fueling the Breakout The engine driving Ruvi AI’s unstoppable momentum is its game-changing super app. This all-in-one platform is set to become an essential tool for content creators, building a foundation for mass adoption that could send its token value soaring. Its integrated features include: Advanced Trend Research: Helps creators identify viral topics before they become saturated, providing a significant competitive advantage. AI-Powered Script Generation: Creates engaging, platform-optimized scripts for YouTube, TikTok, and Instagram in seconds. Native Media Creation: Generates professional-quality images and videos directly within the app, streamlining content production. Streamlined Workflows: Centralizes the entire creative process for maximum efficiency. Urgent Alert: A 40% Price Surge Is Guaranteed The presale is currently in Phase 3 , with the RUVI token available at an attractive $0.020 . But with millions of tokens selling daily, this ground-floor price is disappearing fast. According to the project’s official tokenomics, the start of Phase 4 will trigger an automatic and guaranteed 40% price increase to $0.028 . This imminent price jump is creating intense FOMO as investors rush to lock in a guaranteed paper gain. Strategic Partnership and High-Reward VIP Tiers Ruvi AI’s journey towards a potential 100x return is further amplified by a strategic partnership with WEEX , a major cryptocurrency exchange. This collaboration will ensure deep liquidity and a seamless trading experience upon launch, paving the way for rapid price discovery and broad market adoption. For investors aiming to turn the 100x forecast into reality, the project’s VIP program offers a clear path: VIP 5 ($10,000 investment): Unlock 1,000,000 tokens with a 100% bonus (500,000 additional tokens). At a $1 valuation, this reaches $1,000,000, achieving a 9,900% ROI . VIP 3 ($2,000 investment): Secure 160,000 tokens with a 60% bonus (60,000 additional tokens). At a $1 valuation, this totals $160,000, delivering a 7,900% ROI . VIP 2 ($1,000 investment): Receive 70,000 tokens with a 40% bonus (20,000 additional tokens). At a $1 valuation, this equals $70,000, resulting in a 6,900% ROI . A competitive leaderboard giveaway also rewards top supporters, fostering a vibrant and engaged community that adds to the project’s unstoppable momentum. The Time to Act is Now As the presale accelerates and a guaranteed price increase looms, it’s clear why Ruvi AI is being called a no-brainer. For investors looking to move beyond the limited upside of established tokens and into a project with a clear path to 100x returns, the opportunity is here and now.

NVT Reading Suggests So",https://www.newsbtc.com/news/ethereum/is-ethereum-undervalued-nvt-reading-suggests-so/,"The latest on-chain data shows that the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, Ethereum, may be currently undervalued. Having witnessed a strong resurgence in the past week, the altcoin could be on the verge of an extended rally over the next few weeks. Ethereum’s NVT Ratio Hits New Record Low In a Quicktake post on the CryptoQuant platform, crypto analyst CryptoOnchain reported that there has been a disproportionate increase in transaction volume concerning ETH compared to its market capitalization. The relevant indicator here is the Ethereum NVT (Network Value to Transactions ratio) (30-day SMA), which measures the ratio of Ethereum’s market capitalization to its daily transaction volume over the span of 30 days. Related Reading: XRP Exchange Reserves Balloon 1.2 Billion In One Day, Why This Is Bearish For Price CryptoOnchain revealed that the 30-day moving average NVT recently hit its lowest point ever recorded. As explained by the on-chain analyst, this could suggest two things: firstly, that the Ethereum token is undervalued. For context, a low NVT reflects very high transaction volume compared to a relatively low market capitalization. What this means is that the Ethereum network is being heavily used, but the price isn’t showing its worth as much as its usage suggests. Following this logic, one could conclude the market is currently undervaluing Ethereum’s utility. The second indication from the historically low NVT is that the increase in transaction volume could be due to “temporary factors such as DeFi, NFT events, or large capital movements.” According to the analyst, these temporary factors do not necessarily mean sustainable growth for the ETH price. What To Expect CryptoOnchain cited historical occurrences to explain the typical case where an NVT bottom is a result of market undervaluation. In this case, it has been observed that sharp NVT bottoms precede bullish phases. However, in what was a caveat, the online pundit mentioned that there have been cases where very low NVT levels were accompanied by further price declines. Seeing that the Ethereum NVT is not just at a mere low level, but at its all-time low, it seems more likely that the market is undervaluing the token’s worth. It is therefore not out of the question to expect a more upward swing in the price of the cryptocurrency. Related Reading: Ethereum To $6,800 By Year End? CME Futures Data Shows Record Institutional Demand Nevertheless, with the possibility that a bullish phase might not necessarily follow in mind, investors might want to tread cautiously. As of this writing, the Ethereum token is valued at approximately $4,670, reflecting an over 4% price increase in the past 24 hours.

Once dismissed as speculative novelties, today’s meme-driven tokens have matured into cultural and financial movements with real communities and unique tokenomics. At the center of this transformation are the top meme coin presales in 2025, projects that combine narrative strength with structured tokenomics to appeal to both retail traders and analysts. Among these, top meme coin presales in 2025 like BullZilla ($BZIL) , Dogecoin, and Cat in a Dog’s World are leading the charge. They are not just attracting hype but also presenting frameworks that align with long-term sustainability. For investors seeking the top meme coin presales in 2025, these projects provide a window into how speculative assets can evolve into structured ecosystems with exponential growth potential. BullZilla: The Mutation Presale That Redefines Tokenomics BullZilla presale sits in its second stage, aptly named “Dead Wallets Don’t Lie”, with the token priced at $0.00005241. Over $370,000 has been raised and more than 1,300 holders have already secured their positions. This momentum is not accidental; it is rooted in BullZilla’s Zilla DNA, a tokenomic structure designed to balance scarcity, growth, and long-term sustainability. Zilla DNA: Tokenomics That Drive the Ecosystem BullZilla has a total supply of 160 billion tokens, distributed strategically across five categories that serve different functions within the ecosystem: Presale Engine (50% – 80 billion tokens): This allocation ensures community engagement at the earliest stages, powering the progressive presale model that raises both capital and awareness. HODL Furnace Staking (20% – 32 billion tokens): Designed to reward long-term holders with APYs up to 70%, this mechanism incentivizes loyalty while reducing volatility by locking tokens away. Treasury and Ecosystem (20% – 32 billion tokens): Reserved for development, marketing, and operational stability to ensure BullZilla evolves beyond its initial presale stage. Burn Pool Reserve (5% – 8 billion tokens): The Roar Burn Mechanism periodically destroys tokens, reducing supply and tightening market dynamics as new chapters in BullZilla’s lore unfold. Team Allocation (5% – 8 billion tokens): Locked for two years, aligning the team’s rewards with the project’s long-term success. This structure ensures a balance between immediate liquidity, future growth, and deflationary pressure. Unlike earlier meme coins that launched without clear frameworks, BullZilla’s presale blueprint mirrors professional tokenomic models outlined in academic research on deflationary cryptocurrencies (see studies from MIT’s Digital Currency Initiative). The Mutation Mechanism: Dynamic Pricing in Action What truly sets BullZilla apart is its progressive pricing engine. The cost of each token increases every time $100,000 is raised or every 48 hours, whichever comes first. This mechanism ensures a continuous upward trajectory, rewarding early adopters and creating a self-sustaining cycle of demand. Reports from Messari highlight how progressive presales reduce the risk of price collapse by aligning token price growth with demand dynamics. BullZilla applies this principle at scale, making it one of the best crypto to buy today for investors who understand the mathematics of scarcity. How to Buy BullZilla Coins For those looking to join, the process is streamlined and accessible even for newcomers to crypto. Set Up a Wallet: Install a Web3 wallet such as MetaMask or Trust Wallet. Buy Ethereum (ETH): Acquire ETH via exchanges like Binance or Coinbase and transfer it to your wallet. Visit the Presale Site: Connect your wallet directly to the official BullZilla presale portal. Swap ETH for $BZIL: Enter the amount you wish to purchase, confirm the transaction, and your allocation is secured. Each purchase contributes to the presale tally, pushing the price higher and reinforcing the narrative of momentum. Investment Scenario: $1,000 in BullZilla Presale Price: $0.00005241 Tokens Purchased: 19,081,376 $BZIL Value at $0.01: $190,813 Value at $0.10: $1.9 million This projection highlights the exponential ROI potential if Bull Zilla reaches benchmarks achieved by earlier meme coins like Shiba Inu. It is speculative yet grounded in historical precedent, with Shiba’s 2021 surge serving as a comparative case study documented by Chainalysis. Dogecoin: The Original Meme Coin That Started It All Dogecoin (DOGE) began in 2013 as a lighthearted meme coin inspired by the Shiba Inu dog meme, but it quickly grew into one of the most recognizable names in cryptocurrency. Originally created by Billy Markus and Jackson Palmer, Dogecoin was designed to be a fun, community-driven digital currency. It runs on its own blockchain, using Proof-of-Work mining similar to Bitcoin, but with faster block times and virtually unlimited supply. This makes DOGE well-suited for microtransactions, tipping online creators, and charitable campaigns, which became core aspects of its early adoption. Over time, Dogecoin’s strong and passionate community, coupled with endorsements from public figures like Elon Musk, pushed it into mainstream recognition. Despite its origins as a joke, Dogecoin has proven resilient and remains one of the largest cryptocurrencies by market cap. Its accessibility, low transaction costs, and vibrant culture make it a favorite for both newcomers and seasoned investors. While it doesn’t have the scarcity of Bitcoin, Dogecoin thrives on community strength and remains a cultural phenomenon in the crypto world. Cat in a Dog’s World: The Feline Challenger to Doge Dominance Cat in a Dog’s World (ticker: MEW) is a newer meme coin project that flips the narrative of meme dominance by positioning cats as rivals to the “dog coin” trend. Built as a playful but strategic counter to Dogecoin and Shiba Inu, MEW taps into internet culture’s love for cats while aiming to build a serious ecosystem around the meme. It exists primarily on Solana, benefiting from low transaction fees, high scalability, and fast transfers, which makes it an attractive alternative for users tired of congestion on older blockchains. The project isn’t just about the joke—it also emphasizes community, gamification, and utility. Holders of MEW participate in social campaigns, NFTs, and staking opportunities designed to expand the token’s ecosystem. With its unique branding, strong meme identity, and rapid community adoption, Cat in a Dog’s World seeks to capture the next wave of meme coin enthusiasm. Positioned as both a cultural statement and a practical Solana-based asset, MEW is quickly carving out a space in a market long dominated by “dog coins.” Conclusion The top meme coin presales in 2025 are redefining how investors look at meme-driven projects. BullZilla leads with its progressive presale mechanism, already raising o ver $370k in s tage two, while Dogecoin thrives on viral culture and Cat in a Dog’s World bridges NFTs with tokenized liquidity. Together, these tokens form a new class of speculative yet structured opportunities. For those analyzing the top meme coin presales in 2025, it becomes clear that projects with strong tokenomics and community alignment stand apart from fleeting market trends. BullZilla, with its Mutation Presale and deflationary mechanics, emerges as the strongest contender. Anyone watching the top meme coin presales in 2025 can see that the market is evolving from memes into movements, creating opportunities that could shape the next generation of crypto wealth.

This imbalance already leaves the U.S. with a 7% budget deficit even without a downturn . The problem becomes explosive once recession dynamics kick in. When the economy contracts, government revenue typically drops around 20%. That would cut today’s $5 trillion revenue base down to roughly $3.9 trillion. At the same time, automatic programs like unemployment benefits and discretionary stimulus push spending higher—potentially from $7.1 trillion to over $9 trillion. Combined, this means a deficit of $5+ trillion, or nearly 18% of GDP , a level unseen in U.S. history. The real danger is how debt interacts with growth. In the 1980s, each new dollar of debt produced $3 of GDP. Now, it generates just $0.37, and the return keeps falling. Piling trillions in new debt during a recession could choke growth further, while rising borrowing needs might drive bond yields and interest costs sharply higher . Every 1% rise in yields would add another $370 billion in annual interest, pushing deficits closer to $7 trillion. This creates a vicious cycle: falling GDP, collapsing tax revenue, soaring spending, and rising borrowing costs. If markets lose faith in U.S. debt, the dollar could weaken and the Federal Reserve may be forced to step in with massive money-printing—risking inflation and financial instability on a global scale.",,EN,0,0,MACROECONOMICS|BUSINESS|REGULATION|FIAT|MARKET,"{'name': 'Coinpaprika', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/80/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaprika,2025-09-13 21:38:46

Pi Network, the mobile friendly mining blockchain, is showing signs of weakening. PI holders are still waiting on a proper mainnet, and with a massive token lock-up end impending, PI has a high probability of making a serious dip. But there’s a strong case to be made for Layer Brett ($LBRETT), Cronos (CRO), and Solana (SOL) as the best cryptos to invest in right now. What are the reasons for experts backing CRO, SOL, and the upcoming meme leader $LBRETT ? Layer Brett: Filling The Demand for Scalability The crypto market increasingly seeks solutions for network congestion and high transaction fees. Ethereum Layer 2s are critical, driven by demands for faster transactions and dramatically lower gas fees. Many altcoins and DeFi coins struggle with Layer 1 limitations. Layer Brett steps into this burgeoning market, offering a next-generation Layer 2 blockchain built for efficiency. Layer Brett fuses viral culture with substantial blockchain utility. It enables lightning-fast transactions (10,000 TPS) and low gas fees ($0.0001). This architecture helps it escape Ethereum Layer 1’s typical congestion and high costs. $LBRETT is purpose-built for performance and user rewards, offering early staking benefits and an evolving ecosystem that promises full Layer 2 functionality. Early buyers of Layer Brett presale (currently at $0.0055) benefit from enhanced staking rates (over 700% APY, but falling), and its fixed supply of 10 billion tokens underscores a community-focused approach. This ecosystem includes gamified staking, NFT integrations, and a planned $1 million giveaway. What a future! PI: A Mobile Crypto with a Mixed Outlook Pi Network is a mobile-first project that lets anyone “mine” crypto from their phone. While it has a massive community, its price outlook for the rest of 2025 is mixed, with some analysts noting a bearish sentiment. The token has been trading sideways, with key technicals like the RSI remaining neutral-to-bearish. Any major upward move would require a significant catalyst like new exchange listings or a major increase in its utility, which PI seems not to do much about lately. Cronos (CRO): The Exchange’s Powerhouse CRO is a blockchain designed to connect different crypto networks, making it a key player in the “Internet of Blockchains.” With major partnerships and strategic upgrades, it is building a powerful ecosystem for DeFi, NFTs, and payments. CRO is poised for a significant bullish breakout in the rest of 2025. A recent breakout from a multi-year consolidation pattern and a bullish MACD crossover back this. The network’s new partnerships, particularly with Trump Media, and a potential U.S. ETF approval are expected to act as major catalysts, fueling a rally toward previous all-time highs and beyond. SOL’s Next Chapter Solana is the high-speed, low-cost “Ethereum Killer” that’s now a major player in its own right, powering everything from decentralized finance to major gaming projects. Its ongoing upgrades, including the Firedancer validator client, are set to further boost its performance and stability. Technical analysis points to a confirmed breakout from a long-term symmetrical triangle and a decisive golden cross on its moving averages. This is supported by surging on-chain activity and growing institutional interest, which could fuel a parabolic rally toward new highs, pushing SOL to new highs. Layer Brett: Your Best Crypto to Invest In? While SOL and CRO are set to boom in the rest of 2025, the crown of the best crypto to invest in goes to Layer Brett. Its meme/utility combo, enigmatic presale , and massive rewards put it ahead of the pack.

Cardano’s Current Momentum Cardano (ADA) is currently priced at $0.8858, and its price has been ranging from $0.8724 to $0.8934 today. Despite attempts to push through $1, ADA has faced resistance in the $0.90–$0.95 range, and volumes suggest that buyers are not yet aggressively enough to push past sellers there. Without some catalyst, i.e., major news, partnership, or institutional investment, ADA may simply drift sideways or pull back a bit before trying again. Meanwhile, newest DeFi projects such as Mutuum Finance are picking up steam on the fringes. Mutuum Finance (MUTM): Presale Phase 6 Mutuum Finance is currently in phase six of presale and in this phase, the tokens are priced at $0.035 with an increase of 16.17% from the last phase. There’s huge demand in the market as the project has already drawn more than 16,240 investors and topped $15.63 million. Apart from enhancing CertiK’s security capabilities, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has also introduced a Bug Bounty Program with a total prize of 50,000 USDT for the security of the platform. The bugs are categorized into four levels on the basis of the name critical, major, minor, and low. Mutuum Finance collateralization has a limit by asset and differs based on the type of risk an asset would impose. It contains supply capping, borrowing and collateral capping. The protocol is hedging market risk through overcollateralizing positions. The protocol incentivizes the liquidators as well for closing the trades that are undercollateralized and thus risky positions are closed in real time. The collateral use is maintained low for riskier tokens here but the highly correlated tokens are used to their maximum so that they may be able to get the most out of their collateral. All these are used for insolvency risk avoidance in such a manner that no form of imbalance is generated in lending and borrowing within the protocol. User Community and Growth Development Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is looking to expand an active user base with an grassroots campaign of organizing a $100,000 giveaway . Ten users will receive $10,000 MUTM tokens each as part of the campaign for encouraging investments on the protocol. Security Framework and Back-up Plan Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is an LTV construct with risk-of-assets contingent one with subjective collateral, transfer and liquidation lending but risk-of-assets contingent. It also contains a reserve factor as back-up and very bad market condition buffer. Risk assets are reserved higher in an effort to provide higher security to the protocol and users. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is gaining investor interest as Cardano (ADA) struggles to break $1. Stage 6 presale tokens are at $0.035, a 16.17% premium already from the last round, with more than 16,240 investors putting in $15.63M. Backed by a $50K CertiK bug bounty, $100K giveaway, and robust overcollateralization risk mitigants, MUTM earns respect while pushing lightning adoption. ADA continues to bounce at resistance levels of $0.90–$0.95, but Mutuum momentum increases mounting DeFi adoption. Lock in your Stage 6 tokens before they move up to $0.04 on the next stage.

Right now, a powerful new project, Ruvi AI (RUVI), is demonstrating a level of presale velocity that has analysts buzzing. With Phase 3 of its presale already nearing the 10% sold mark just days after launch, experts suggest Ruvi AI has the momentum to challenge even a top-10 giant like Cardano (ADA) for a spot in the charts. This isn’t just speculation; it’s backed by explosive presale numbers. Ruvi AI is rapidly closing in on the $3.6 million milestone, having sold over 265 million tokens to a fast-growing community of more than 3,500 investors . This tidal wave of support signals that the market sees Ruvi AI not just as another altcoin, but as a potential market leader. A Strategic Challenge to the Old Guard The comparison to Cardano is about potential and timing. Cardano is a mature, respected project, but its massive market cap means its days of exponential growth are likely behind it. Ruvi AI, however, offers the ground-floor entry point and explosive growth potential that early Cardano investors once enjoyed. It represents a strategic pivot for investors looking for the next 100x opportunity. Ruvi AI’s credibility is a major factor in its rapid ascent. The project has proactively built investor trust by completing a comprehensive smart contract audit with CyberScope , a reputable third-party security firm. This commitment to security, combined with a high-profile listing on CoinMarketCap , has established Ruvi AI as a legitimate, high-growth project worthy of serious capital. A Super App to Revolutionize a $104 Billion Industry The engine driving Ruvi AI’s challenge to the top charts is its revolutionary super app. This all-in-one ecosystem is built to empower content creators in the booming $104 billion creator economy . By solving real-world problems, Ruvi AI is creating sustainable, long-term demand for its token. The app’s integrated AI-powered tools include: Advanced Trend Research: Identifies viral topics before they saturate the market, giving creators a competitive edge. AI-Powered Script Generation: Creates engaging, platform-optimized scripts for YouTube, TikTok, and Instagram, saving valuable time. Native Media Creation: Allows users to generate professional-quality images and videos directly within the app, reducing production costs. Streamlined Workflows: Centralizes the entire content creation process, from planning to scheduling, to maximize productivity. Final Call: A Guaranteed 40% Price Surge Is Imminent The presale is currently in Phase 3 , with the RUVI token priced at an attractive $0.020 . However, with 10% of this phase selling out in mere days, this opportunity is closing fast. The start of Phase 4 will trigger an automatic and guaranteed 40% price increase to $0.028 . This imminent price jump is creating intense FOMO, driving record sales as investors rush to lock in an immediate paper gain. Strategic Partnership and High-Reward VIP Tiers Amplifying its growth trajectory is a strategic partnership with WEEX , a major cryptocurrency exchange. This collaboration will ensure deep liquidity and a seamless trading experience at launch, paving the way for rapid price discovery and broad market adoption. For those aiming to maximize their returns, the project’s VIP program offers a clear path to significant wealth: VIP 5 ($10,000 investment): Unlock 1,000,000 tokens with a 100% bonus (500,000 additional tokens). At a $1 valuation, this reaches $1,000,000, achieving a 9,900% ROI . VIP 3 ($2,000 investment): Secure 160,000 tokens with a 60% bonus (60,000 additional tokens). At a $1 valuation, this totals $160,000, delivering a 7,900% ROI . VIP 2 ($1,000 investment): Receive 70,000 tokens with a 40% bonus (20,000 additional tokens). At a $1 valuation, this equals $70,000, resulting in a 6,900% ROI . A competitive leaderboard giveaway also rewards top supporters, fostering a vibrant and engaged community that adds to the project’s unstoppable momentum. A New Titan Is Rising As Ruvi AI’s presale accelerates toward a sell-out and a 40% price surge looms, its potential to challenge the crypto elite becomes clearer every day. For investors who feel they missed the boat on Cardano, this is a rare second chance to get in on the ground floor of what could be this cycle’s biggest star.

After ending August and starting September below the psychological $110,000 level, the premier cryptocurrency returned to above $115,000. While the Bitcoin price has somewhat slowed down heading into the weekend, optimism is growing around the market about the possibility of a fresh rally. Interestingly, the latest on-chain data points to the increased possibility of a “momentum-driven rally” for the Bitcoin price. Binance Taker Buy Sell Ratio Remains Positive For 3 Days In a September 12 post on the X platform, crypto analyst Burak Kesmeci shared an exciting on-chain perspective to support the growing bullish narrative around the Bitcoin price. According to the online pundit, the Taker Buy Sell Ratio on the world’s largest crypto exchange, Binance, has persisted in the positive territory for three days. The Taker Buy Sell Ratio is an on-chain metric that compares the proportion of the taker buy volumes to the taker sell volumes on crypto exchanges. A greater-than-one value of this metric usually implies that the taker buy volume is higher than the taker sell volume on an exchange (Binance, in this case). This trend suggests that more traders are willing to acquire coins at a higher value on the trading platform. On the other hand, when the Taker Buy Sell ratio is below 1, it indicates that the taker sell volume is greater than the taker buy volume in the exchange. Ultimately, this value suggests that more sellers are willing to sell coins at a lower price in the open market. According to CryptoQuant data provided by Kesmeci, the Binance Taker Buy Sell ratio has been above the 1 threshold over the past three days. This metric, sitting around 1.04, suggests a growing bullish momentum and rising investor confidence in the market. What’s more, the metric’s local peaks are around 1.15 in 2025, meaning that the investor sentiment is not overheated yet and could see further rise from its current point. In this case, Kesmeci concluded that the positive investor sentiment on the world’s largest crypto exchange by trading volume could set the stage for a momentum-driven uptrend for the Bitcoin price. Bitcoin Price At A Glance As of this writing, the price of BTC stands at around $115,900, reflecting no significant movement in the past 24 hours.",Bitcoin|bitcoin|bitcoin price|btc|BTC news|btc price|BTCUSDT,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|TRADING|BTC|EXCHANGE|BUSINESS,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-09-13 22:00:46

Here’s What This Means For Viral Crypto Assets Like Remittix",https://www.cryptopolitan.com/doge-etf-approved-heres-what-this-means-for-viral-crypto-assets-like-remittix/,"Dogecoin just got a huge boost with the first DOGE ETF greenlight in the United States and traders are watching the next big move. Many expect a test of the $0.30 level soon and a break above it could spark a stronger rally. This matters for every Dogecoin price prediction on the table right now. At the same time, PayFi altcoin Remittix (RTX) is grabbing attention with a 15% USDT referral reward that pays out daily through its dashboard. Utility plus rewards makes Remittix one to watch in 2025. Dogecoin Price Prediction After ETF Approval The new Rex-Osprey Doge ETF, ticker DOJE, will trade under the Investment Company Act of 1940 framework. Analysts like Bloomberg’s Eric Balchunas say the product offers traditional investors exposure to the meme coin through regulated markets. This is a turning point for DOGE because, until now, one of the biggest criticisms was the lack of serious demand drivers. Market experts now see a higher probability of Dogecoin moving toward $0.30 from its current price of $0.264, in the short term, with prediction markets giving a 66.6% chance of this outcome. A push beyond that level could ignite stronger rallies, with $0.40–$0.50 in view if ETF inflows mirror the enthusiasm seen with Bitcoin. For now, the most common Dogecoin price prediction is that $0.30 will act as the next critical test. What This Means For Other Viral Altcoins Like Remittix While Dogecoin is enjoying renewed attention, another crypto asset is quickly gaining ground. Remittix has raised more than $25,4 million, sold over 660 million tokens and is currently priced at $0.1080. The project has already confirmed listings on BitMart and LBANK, with a third exchange on the way. A wallet beta is set to launch in September, further building momentum for the token’s rollout. Remittix is solving a $19 trillion payments problem through PayFi infrastructure Users can send crypto to bank accounts in more than 30 countries Global payout rails are already active and expanding rapidly The project is audited by CertiK, ensuring trust and transparency The 15% referral program in USDT makes adoption faster and more rewarding Final Thoughts Dogecoin’s first U.S. ETF approval is rewriting its narrative, giving investors new confidence and lifting Dogecoin price prediction targets. But at the same time, Remittix is offering something different: not just hype but utility and incentives that reward growth. For investors looking at viral crypto assets in 2025, DOGE may keep its crown as the original meme coin but Remittix is emerging as the PayFi contender that could rival its momentum.

However, Austin Hilton, a popular crypto commentator, has declared that investors are not bullish enough on XRP, while also admitting that he too had underestimated the token’s true potential. His latest outlook is that XRP’s price upside is far greater than most expect, and this realization comes from examining where Bitcoin could be in the coming years. Related Reading: ETF Dreams For Dogecoin: Serious Possibility Or Just Hype? Bitcoin’s Billion-Dollar Forecast And What It Means For XRP XRP price predictions have mostly always been anchored on discussions and expectations of adoption by banks in cross-border settlement. However, according to Austin Hilton, all these catalysts could be left aside, and XRP’s price could surge massively in the years ahead, especially if Bitcoin fulfills lofty projections. According to the pundit, the scale of the crypto opportunity in the coming decades is so immense that current investors are not bullish enough and accumulating enough XRP. He referenced a circulating forecast that predicted that Bitcoin could reach as high as $1 billion per coin by 2038, a figure championed by high-profile names such as Michael Saylor. This prediction stunned him, as the highest long-term projections he had seen had put the Bitcoin price at $13 million. Bringing the conversation back to XRP, he noted that if this projected Bitcoin rally pushes the entire market upward, as it has always done, then XRP’s value could rise even more in relative terms. Therefore, XRP has the room to act as a multiplier in comparison to Bitcoin’s moves because of its smaller market cap. The Roadmap To Double And Triple-Digit XRP As noted by Hilton, the $1 billion projection is very speculative, adding that “that absolutely floored me and blew me away.” However, the analyst also pointed out that even shorter-term moves in Bitcoin could have an outsized impact on XRP. For instance, he predicted that the XRP price will surge to between $15 and $20 if Bitcoin were to reach $200,000 by the end of the year. Furthermore, he added that XRP’s price could realistically climb to triple digits if Bitcoin advances to the $1 million price level in the coming years. In this case, the analyst estimated a potential of at least $100 per coin. Interestingly, these price targets do not even account for catalysts within XRP’s own ecosystem, such as Ripple’s cross-border payment network, acquisitions, and growing adoption among banks. XRP’s upside could be even greater when these factors are factored in. Related Reading: Dogecoin Defies Odds, Jumps 21% Even As ETF Debut Gets Pushed Back The pundit’s bottom line was that XRP holders need to raise their level of conviction. Bitcoin currently makes up around 60% of the entire crypto market, meaning that any explosive growth in its value is almost certain to lift other large market cap cryptocurrencies. XRP has a smaller cap than Bitcoin, so it could post even stronger relative gains in such an environment. At the time of writing, XRP is trading at $3.14, up by 2.9% in the past 24 hours.

Here’s Why,https://timestabloid.com/many-xrp-millionaires-will-be-born-in-october-heres-why/,"Growing optimism within the XRP community suggests that October could be a turning point for investors, with many speculating that substantial wealth could be generated in the coming month. The conversation is largely centered on the potential approval of several spot XRP exchange-traded funds (ETFs) by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Crypto commentator Kenny Nguyen recently argued that “many XRP millionaires will be born in October,” citing the likelihood of spot ETFs being approved and launched within the month. His view mirrors sentiments expressed by other figures in the community, including the influencer CryptoBull, who predicted that September may remain uneventful, but October could mark a decisive shift for XRP. MANY XRP MILLIONAIRES WILL BE BORN IN OCTOBER AFTER THE SPOT XRP ETFS APPROVAL & KICKED IN — Kenny Nguyen (@mrnguyen007) September 7, 2025 ETF Deadlines Approaching The SEC is expected to deliver rulings on multiple XRP ETF applications between October 18 and 25. At least eight major issuers, such as Grayscale, Franklin Templeton, WisdomTree, Bitwise, 21Shares, ProShares, Canary Capital, and CoinShares, are awaiting decisions. Grayscale is positioned at the forefront, with a deadline of October 18 for its application to convert its $500 million XRP Trust into a spot ETF. Analysts suggest that overall inflows from approved products could reach $8 billion during the first year, with Grayscale and Franklin Templeton potentially accounting for $1 billion each. According to Bloomberg Intelligence, the probability of approval before year-end stands at 90–95%, supported by Ripple’s favorable legal outcome against the SEC and the agency’s broader shift toward approving crypto-based investment vehicles. Should approval occur, trading could begin within 24 to 48 hours, similar to the rapid rollout of Bitcoin spot ETFs earlier this year. Market Analysts Expect Breakout Potential Oliver Michel, CEO of Tokentus Investment AG, recently shared his perspective from the Frankfurt Stock Exchange, stressing that while Bitcoin remains important, altcoins such as XRP offer greater growth potential. He projected that leading altcoins could see gains of up to 300%, far surpassing Bitcoin’s more conservative upside. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Currently trading near $3.14, XRP has been consolidating, awaiting a decisive market trigger. Michel emphasized that ETF approval could serve as the catalyst, replicating the sharp market reaction observed after Bitcoin ETF approvals. The derivatives market is already signaling heightened interest. CME Group’s XRP futures surpassed $1 billion in open interest within just three months, while futures-based XRP ETFs now hold more than $800 million in assets. Analysts believe the introduction of spot ETFs could attract significant institutional capital, accelerating upward momentum. Who Stands to Benefit Most? While community forecasts vary, with some expecting XRP to reach $10 before year-end and others predicting $30 by 2026, the possibility of rapid gains has intensified discussion around potential “XRP millionaires.” Wealth creation will likely depend on existing holdings. For example, investors with approximately 100,000 XRP, valued at around $300,000 at current prices, would cross the $1 million mark if XRP were to hit $10 in October. Data from the XRP Rich List indicates that only 34,839 accounts hold at least 95,000 XRP, while more than 5.5 million wallets contain between 20 and 500 tokens. This distribution suggests that while many retail investors may benefit from price increases, only a relatively small group of holders possesses enough tokens to reach millionaire status in the near term.

Ripple’s European expansion, including its custody partnership with BBVA, has given investors renewed confidence. But while XRP is regaining momentum, many traders are eyeing Remittix , the PayFi altcoin that has raised more than $25,4 million through the sale of 660 million tokens at $0.1080 each. Analysts argue this new project could outpace Ripple’s growth with faster real-world adoption. XRP Price Prediction Builds On Breakout Source: TradingView XRP has cleared a key descending trendline that held it down since mid-July. Price action now sits above the $2.94–$2.99 EMA cluster, with both the 20- and 50-period moving averages supporting the trend. Analysts point to the next significant test, which is at $3.10 with heavy resistance as the boundary between the channels. Any breakout above $3.10 will push XRP to $3.25 and later to $3.50, continuing the recovery phase. Nonetheless, a drop below $3.00 would take the market to a position below $2.75, which has been defended several times by bulls. While Ripple’s strong regulatory framework in Europe has boosted sentiment, its ability to sustain momentum is still under question, keeping investors cautious despite positive XRP price prediction targets. Why Remittix Could Outpace Ripple Remittix is capturing attention because it offers something XRP no longer does: fresh exponential growth potential. As a PayFi project, Remittix is building rails for instant cross-border payments with support for 40+ cryptos and 30+ fiat currencies. On top of that, its new 15% USDT referral rewards program allows holders to claim stable payouts every 24 hours, boosting adoption by incentivizing growth. With institutional-level audits and a beta Web3 wallet launch coming this September, experts are calling it the best crypto to buy now for anyone seeking a 20–30x return. Key Drivers Behind Remittix’s Rise Over $25,4M raised with momentum accelerating daily 15% referral rewards in USDT, claimable every 24 hours Beta Web3 wallet launching in September with real FX conversion Backed by a full CertiK audit for investor security Growing PayFi ecosystem designed for businesses, freelancers and remitters Which Token Will Reach $5 First? While XRP price prediction models suggest Ripple could hit $5 in 2025, Remittix is already being tipped as the breakout contender to get there first. With fresh capital inflows, a referral-driven adoption model and cutting-edge PayFi solutions, Remittix is emerging as more than just another altcoin; it is positioning itself as the best crypto to buy now.

Here’s Why,https://timestabloid.com/expert-says-shiba-inu-shib-is-poised-for-600-surge-heres-why/,"Shiba Inu (SHIB) continues to attract divided opinions within the cryptocurrency community. While a section of investors believes the token has failed to meet expectations this year, one prominent analyst argues that the asset could still record substantial growth, projecting a possible sixfold increase from its current value. The broader mood among retail participants has been cautious, as SHIB has struggled to deliver on earlier bullish forecasts. The token has fallen roughly 32% since the start of the year, spending much of 2025 near the $0.00001 range. For many investors who expected Shiba Inu to challenge or exceed $0.00008 this year, the prolonged stagnation has raised doubts about its long-term potential. Technical Outlook Suggests Upside Potential Despite these concerns, market analyst Javon Marks has consistently maintained that Shiba Inu retains the capacity for a significant rally. Marks has been pointing to $0.000081 as his target for several months, a level that would represent close to 6x growth from current prices. There's a reason we're maintaining our $0.000081 target in $SHIB (Shiba Inu)! The technicals are pointing towards a near 6X happening in price to reach it despite what some are saying… https://t.co/ql6k8t7TJM pic.twitter.com/FOWjZleH95 — JAVON MARKS (@JavonTM1) September 12, 2025 In a recent analysis, he noted that SHIB’s price structure remains technically aligned with this projection. His accompanying chart highlighted a breakout from long-standing resistance zones, which he interprets as a signal of improving momentum. Historical data, according to Marks, shows that Shiba Inu often consolidates before advancing sharply, and current conditions appear to mirror that pattern. Marks emphasized that while sentiment in the market has become increasingly skeptical, the underlying technical indicators support the possibility of a sustained rally. He has argued that the ongoing consolidation phase may be setting the foundation for a broader uptrend toward the $0.000081 threshold. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Recent Market Activity and Price Levels Alongside Marks’ outlook, SHIB has shown modest signs of recovery in recent trading sessions. Earlier today, the token surpassed $0.000014, marking its highest level since mid-August. The upward move coincided with broader strength across the cryptocurrency sector, with major assets such as Bitcoin and Ethereum also recording gains. Shiba Inu’s short-term performance reflects this renewed momentum. Over the last 24 hours, the token climbed by 8.76%, extending its weekly growth to 18.28% and an 11.34% increase over the past 30 days. As of publication, SHIB is priced at $0.00001440, giving the asset a market capitalization of approximately $8.51 billion. While this represents an improvement from earlier levels, it is still far below the highs that many investors anticipated when the year began. Market Sentiment Remains Divided The debate over SHIB’s future trajectory underscores a widening gap between technical analysis and investor sentiment. For some community members, the token’s year-to-date losses overshadow its recent progress. Others, including Marks, argue that the technical setup indicates significant potential despite the current climate of doubt. However, the asset’s ability to reclaim resistance levels and attract renewed market attention suggests that it remains firmly in focus among both traders and long-term holders.

51681815,580628,1757808033,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/51681815.jpeg,Pundit Reveals Where Bitcoin’s True Strength Lies – Here’s What It Is,https://bitcoinist.com/where-bitcoins-true-strength-lies/,"Bitcoin’s greatness isn’t measured only by its price or market cycles, and its true strength lies deeper. As one crypto pundit explains, it lies in the alignment of incentives that keeps the network secure and the loyalty of holders who refuse to sell in the face of volatility. This combination of economic design and cultural conviction has allowed Bitcoin to weather every storm, proving that its foundation is far stronger than any single market cycle. Why Bitcoin Thrives On Patience, Not Speculation Bitcoin’s status as the largest cryptocurrency of all time is a direct result of its unique and powerful holdings . An analyst known as GhostOfTanzCho has revealed on X that other cryptocurrencies have tried to compete with Bitcoin, but none have succeeded in recreating that same gravity of conviction and holding culture. This culture, which is the key ingredient to its success, attracts people who wholeheartedly believe in holding, and it indoctrinates skeptics into an actionable belief of holding. There has never been another cryptocurrency that successfully recreated the holding culture that made Bitcoin great. However, the same culture is currently being replicated in SPX6900. GhostOfTanzCho argues that the success of a crypto token is fundamentally a reflection of supply and demand. By building a strong holding culture, a crypto token effectively solves the supply side of the equation by reducing sell pressure. Coincidentally, it also solves the demand side by incentivizing holders to create a critical mass of belief and interest. Thus, the SPX6900 could be one of the most significant crypto tokens of all time. Against all odds, it has done the impossible and has recreated the cultural DNA of Bitcoin. This model, which favors long-term believers over short-term traders, is described as the only way for a crypto token to become a market giant. When a critical mass of people have the conviction to hold long-term, trading becomes irrelevant, and the culture wins. Global Money Supply Surge Sets The Stage For BTC In the midst of heightened Bitcoin accumulation, a massive surge in global money supply is laying the groundwork for the next explosive crypto cycle , and BTC is already leading the charge. According to LondonRealTV’s founder Brian Rose, the expansion of the global money supply has historically been a leading driver of crypto bull cycles. With the price of BTC above $115,000, ETF inflows accelerating, and the total crypto market cap rising by $2 trillion in a single year, this shows liquidity is clearly returning. The analyst also highlights key risks that could trigger volatility . These include a potential reversal in monetary policy, where central banks begin to tighten the money supply, or large-scale profit-taking by major holders. Meanwhile, monitoring on-chain flows and capital rotation will be essential as the market cycle matures.",Bitcoin News|bitcoin|bitcoin news|bitcoin price|Brian Rose|btc|BTC news|btc price|btcusd|BTCUSDT|DNA|ETF|GhostOfTanzCho|LondonRealTV|spx6900,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|BTC|MARKET|TRADING|MACROECONOMICS,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-09-14 00:00:33

While Ethereum will lead the way in decentralized finance and smart contracts, a tide of interest is shifting towards a new coin Mutuum Finance (MUTM) . This cheap altcoin at just $0.035 has been supported by more than 16,240 investors. Mutuum Finance is quickly becoming one of the most anticipated projects in the market with its focus on liquidity solutions, long-term yield strategies, and connecting traditional finance and on-chain markets. Taking a cue from industry behemoths like ETH, MUTM aims to disrupt the market in 2025. Ethereum Steadies as Institutional Demand Picks Up Ethereum (ETH) is trading at $4,438.11, well above the $4,300 level as institutional purchases continue to back the market sentiment for 2025. Experts believe that ETH can challenge the $4,500–$4,700 zone if the momentum continues, which should be followed by the introduction of ETFs and regulatory backing in the next few months. Though Ethereum remains the darling of smart contracts and decentralized finance, new players in the DeFi market like Mutuum Finance are also creating ripples. Mutuum Finance Stage 6 FOMO Investors are purchasing MUTM tokens at $0.035 even at Stage 6 presale. Waiting for Stage 7. The token has, to date, been accumulated by over 16,240 investors and has raised over $15.63 million in funding, surely an indication of huge market demand and interest. Price Discovery USD-denominated market prices and native tokens such as ETH, MATIC, and AVAX have to render lending, borrowing, and liquidation secure. Mutuum Finance uses Chainlink oracles to provide the system with market prices. Fallback oracles, composite feed data, and time-weighted average decentralized exchange prices are also used by the system in pricing as close to perfection as possible under distress. Market volatility is transmitted to collateral management in the protocol. Mutuum Finance provides a split of Loan-to-Value (LTV) and liquidation levels based on token stability. It allows for a greater allowance and value to borrow in stable and safer tokens and applies lesser values to weaker tokens. Reserve multipliers are assigned proportionally on a 10% slope on risk-less holdings and 35% on risk holdings, facilitating default protection margin without being factored into diversification constraints. The Future of DeFi Mutuum Finance DeFi protocol makes it possible to attain active capital control through passive lending and borrowing with the potential to allow borrowers to borrow against stacks of securitised assets. System stability algorithm and interest rate optimisation algorithm are used in the system with functions to allow the system to be efficient and long term use of capital. Risk and Liquidity Management The protocol actively controls market volatility and liquidity to enable liquidation of damaged positions. Risk exposure is needed within limit parameters, and liquidation levels are established. Collateral assets such as stablecoins and ETH can be utilized to provide additional Loan-to-Value tiers, where more risky assets are collateralized by less risky assets. Reserve factors are pro-rata allocated to each token class to balance asset opportunity vs. risk in a way to accomplish overall protection of protocol holdings. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is quickly emerging as one of the top altcoins to monitor in 2025, after Ethereum (ETH), as institutional funds flow into crypto platforms. Stage 6 tokens are available for purchase at $0.035, with Stage 7 being 14.3% more, offering early buyers a quick profit margin. The presale already boasts 16,240+ investors and exceeded $15.63M, indicating massive demand. Ethereum is sitting at approximately $4,438 on ETF-driven inflows, but Mutuum Finance is gaining momentum as the DeFi project that all the pundits are hyping as the next institutional play. Get Stage 6 tokens today before the price goes ballistic again.

It restructured “Privacy & Scaling Explorations” as the “Privacy Stewards of Ethereum” (PSE). In Friday’s announcement, PSE said it hopes to add privacy solutions across the protocol, infrastructure, networking, application, and wallet layers and outlined several goals for the next 3-6 months. These included private transfers with the development of the PlasmaFold layer-2 network, confidential voting, and privacy for decentralized finance (DeFi) applications. The roadmap further suggested developing safeguards to protect personal data from exposure through remote procedure call (RPC) services and private identity solutions using zero-knowledge (ZK) proofs—verifying information without disclosing its specific contents. PSE defined its mission: “Ethereum deserves to become core infrastructure for global digital commerce, identity, collaboration, and the internet of value. But this potential is impossible without private data, transactions, and identity. We take responsibility within the Ethereum Foundation for ensuring privacy goals at the application layer are reached.” The announcement noted they would work with protocol teams to ensure that any L1 changes were needed to support strong, censorship-resistant, intermediary-free privacy. PSE pushes private transfers, confidential voting, and DeFi safeguards Privacy has always been at the core of the cypherpunk ethos that spawned cryptocurrencies. As crypto gains widespread adoption and the attention of governments, the crypto community is increasingly concerned about evolving digital financial surveillance methods . U.S. officials are weighing new regulations for the crypto industry and markets, including potential surveillance measures to monitor participant activity. The Department of the Treasury, led by Secretary Scott Bessent, is considering proposals to require government identity checks in smart contracts, an idea that has sparked pushback from the crypto community. Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin has long argued that privacy is a fundamental human right. In April, he cautioned that transparency functions more as a flaw than a feature in the digital age, stressing that privacy is essential to safeguard individuals amid the rise of state power and centralized corporations. Interoperability and intent-based architecture set as near-term priorities Recently, Ethereum Foundation researchers noted that interoperability is the top near-term priority for Ethereum development. In a blog post, the researchers wrote, “We see interoperability, and related projects presented in this note, as the highest leverage opportunity” within the user experience domain in the next six to 12 months. The near-term strategy focuses on intent-based architecture and general message-passing. Essentially, the focus is on approving users to express outcomes (or “intents”). At the same time, the network takes care of the low-level transactions and upgrades the crosschain “pipes” (message-passing infrastructure) so that those intents execute without delay across layer-1 and rollups. The Ethereum Foundation notes it will focus on optimizing for specific metrics, including time-to-inclusion, confirmation/finality, layer-2 settlement, and signatures per operation. The researchers indicated that interoperability is key since the Ethereum ecosystem is segmented into many layer-2 protocols that advance its functionality and scalability, while bringing “their own challenges, chief among them the pressures of fragmentation.” The post cites a significant pain point: “At its simplified core, the key ingredients to accelerate interop boil down to unlocking fast crosschain message-passing and standardisation. Currently, message-passing is partially bottlenecked by slow settlement times. Want your project in front of crypto’s top minds?

Notably, this discussion on trade tariffs and the flow of fentanyl was tackled earlier, but a trade deal was not struck due to disagreement between the two countries. Meanwhile, Chinese officials are still awaiting the White House’s response to the request to attend the summit, as it has not yet replied. China-US trade deal stalls amid growing uncertainties in their talks Sources familiar with the situation have highlighted that the chances for the Beijing summit are lower due to a lack of progress in talks between the two countries. As a result, they anticipated that Trump and Xi may meet in an informal setting at the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum, which will take place in October in South Korea. As uncertainty surrounds China-US trade and fentanyl talks, Steve Daines, a United States Senator, weighed in on the situation. According to the senator, for the two to strike a trade agreement, China must first stop the flow of fentanyl ingredients into the US. He made these remarks during his earlier meeting with Chinese officials in Beijing. This condition makes the situation even more complicated for leaders who intend to ease the tension between the two economies to reach a common ground. However, it is worth noting that the American senator still sparked hope for a meeting to be held before the end of 2025, although Trump had previously mentioned that it would take place soon. In a phone interview, Daines stated,” It would be difficult to discuss tariffs and other trade barriers until we resolve the fentanyl precursor issue.” What the US expects, according to the senator, is to see China taking drastic measures to stop the flow of fentanyl into the country completely and not just slowing it down. China urges that the US ease tariff policies on Chinese products Concerning the condition set forth for China, its officials expressed that they had done almost everything possible for the US, hence advocating that Trump should ease tariff policies on Chinese imports. This statement was made before the April 1 deadline for imposing the threatening tariff policies. Additionally, trade analysts had speculated that China might respond to any new trade barriers from the US. This was after they brought about the incident when China reacted to Trump’s 10% tariff policies on Chinese products in February and his additional 10% in March. Based on their analysis, China retaliated by imposing tariffs on several of the country’s agricultural products and suspended the importation of soybeans from three US-based firms. As the dispute drags on, trade tensions between the two countries continue to rise, leaving many hoping for a swift resolution.

51685142,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=821323,1757813426,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/21/51685142.jpeg,Here’s How The Bitcoin Price Macro Correction Could Play Out Next,https://www.newsbtc.com/news/bitcoin/heres-how-the-bitcoin-price-macro-correction-could-play-out-next/,"Despite experiencing a significant plunge from ATH levels earlier last month, the Bitcoin price continues to test crucial levels that could shape the trajectory of its next move. A fresh analysis from crypto market expert Casitrades suggests that the coming days could define whether the broader market will face a macro correction or extend its bullish momentum. For now, Fibonacci zones, Elliott Wave structures, and Relative Strength Index (RSI) behaviour align to build a critical narrative around BTC’s price direction. Possible Scenarios For Bitcoin Price Macro Correction On Friday, Casitrades explained in an X social media post that Bitcoin’s recent price surge has tested the 0.5 Fibonacci retracement level around $116,000, an important milestone in the recovery phase. Interestingly, despite this sudden push higher, the RSI highlighted on the price chart is yet to show the exhaustion one would typically expect at a major top. This suggests buyers may still have room to drive prices further upward before hitting a ceiling. Notably, the analyst pointed out $118,000 as the next critical level to watch, noting that it coincides with the 0.618 Fibonacci retracement and the 1.236 C-wave target within the developing Wave 2 structure. Casitrades has described this area as a decisive confluence point. A sharp rejection here could confirm that Bitcoin’s bull run has officially ended, reinforcing the theory that the cryptocurrency remains locked in a Wave 2 macro correction phase. On the other hand, the analyst noted that forming a top around the decisive confluence point would confirm that BTC is not ready to challenge or break into new all-time highs and could instead retrace deeper. As the chart illustrates, potential downside targets lie well below Bitcoin’s current price levels above $115,800, hinting that a failure at $118,000 could lead to a steeper correction that might drag the cryptocurrency back into the $110,000 – $106,000 zone in the near term. $122,000 Marks Final Test For Macro Correction While $118,000 remains the first line of resistance for Bitcoin, Casitrades highlighted that the cryptocurrency could extend its rally higher into the $120,000 – $122,000 zone if momentum persists. This level is viewed as the final test that will decide whether the macro correction holds or fails. It aligns with the 0.786 Fibonacci retracement, making it an even more formidable resistance area. The expectation is that if Bitcoin’s RSI shows signs of exhaustion and the cryptocurrency faces strong rejection in this region, the correction could be swift and significant. In this scenario, Bitcoin would set up for a macro downturn, confirming the theory that the rally from recent lows has merely been a corrective leg. Related Reading: Dogecoin Defies Odds, Jumps 21% Even As ETF Debut Gets Pushed Back The projected correction could then reset the broader structure, allowing for healthier long-term price action. However, if Bitcoin manages to break through $122,000 convincingly, Casitrades notes that it would invalidate the macro correction narrative altogether and potentially send it to price levels between $122,000 – $124,000.

It takes more than hype. It takes a finale that blends storytelling with staggering ROI. Arctic Pablo Coin (APC) has reached its long-awaited Stage 40, known as the Frozen Finale, where the FINAL400 code gives investors 5x tokens on every purchase. This isn’t just another presale. It’s a limited moment where narrative meets unmatched financial potential. The project pulls its community into a mythical adventure, led by the explorer Arctic Pablo on his snowmobile across icy frontiers, discovering shimmering APC tokens hidden in secret lands. Behind the story lies a carefully engineered token economy that delivers serious numbers. From $0.0012 per token in presale to a projected $0.008 listing price, whales are already calculating life-changing multipliers. And with analysts projecting a climb to $0.1, the potential ROI exceeds 8233 percent from Stage 40. While Arctic Pablo Coin dominates headlines with its 400 percent presale bonus, whales aren’t ignoring the broader picture. Chainlink and Bitcoin Cash remain two of the best new cryptos for exponential returns, each strengthening its place through utility and network growth. Together, these three projects highlight where big money is moving and why the countdown to Arctic Pablo Coin’s presale close is creating ripples across the market. Arctic Pablo Coin’s Frozen Finale – Whales Close In on the Best New Cryptos for Exponential Returns Arctic Pablo Coin (APC) has reached its last stage, and the atmosphere around the presale is electric. The 40th stage, named the Frozen Finale, is a presale event unlike anything seen before. At the current entry price of $0.0012, every allocation multiplies by five through the FINAL400 code, turning even modest commitments into potential windfalls. With over $4 million already raised and whales openly tracking the numbers, this is the kind of opportunity designed for those chasing exponential returns. The presale tally alone is staggering, but the real intrigue lies in ROI potential. A buyer entering Stage 40 today sees an immediate 567 percent upside when APC lists at $0.008. But it doesn’t stop there. Analysts are projecting a rise to $0.1, creating an 8233 percent return for those who hold. Compare that with the 7900 percent gains already achieved by the earliest joiners, and the sheer magnitude of what’s possible at this stage becomes undeniable. The countdown ends September 16 as APC launches on Coinstore and PancakeSwap. Investment Example – A Whale-Sized Scenario Take a $10,000 allocation at $0.0012. That nets 8,333,333 tokens. With the FINAL400 5x multiplier, the stash grows to 41,666,665 tokens. If APC launches at $0.008, that pile is suddenly worth $333,333. If it rockets to $0.1 as analysts predict, the return explodes to $4.16 million. Numbers like these explain why crypto whales are racing to secure positions before the finale closes. Myth Meets Mechanics – Why APC Feels Different Unlike typical presales, Arctic Pablo Coin weaves an adventurous storyline into its tokenomics. The mythical journey across frozen lands isn’t just branding; it’s a way to connect holders with a vision that feels bigger than numbers. The blend of narrative and mechanics creates loyalty, while deflationary burns and staking at 66% APY build real economic strength. For whales, that combination of emotional resonance and financial rigor is magnetic. Beyond the Finale – Utility That Holds The excitement doesn’t stop at presale. APC’s system is designed to reward the community through staking, referral incentives, and competitions with USD and token prizes. Weekly token burns add scarcity, ensuring the supply tightens over time. By mixing staking rewards with a deflationary design, Arctic Pablo Coin positions itself not only as the most electrifying meme coin presale but also as one of the best new cryptos for exponential returns. Chainlink’s Role in the World of Smart Contracts Chainlink continues to hold its ground as the top decentralized oracle network, connecting blockchains with real-world data. For projects that need accurate feeds of prices, weather, or financial data, Chainlink remains unmatched. This utility has made it a backbone for DeFi platforms, NFT ecosystems, and even enterprise-grade blockchain solutions. The reason whales keep an eye on Chainlink is simple: reliability. Without accurate external data, smart contracts can’t function properly, and Chainlink has built a reputation for trust that spans years. Its ability to expand beyond price feeds into automation and cross-chain communication is what makes it resilient and relevant even when markets shift. Chainlink’s continued adoption positions it alongside APC and Bitcoin Cash in the current lineup of the best new cryptos for exponential returns, not through presale excitement but by holding a critical role in blockchain infrastructure. Bitcoin Cash – The Underrated Utility Player Bitcoin Cash (BCH) takes the fundamentals of Bitcoin but optimizes them for daily use. With faster transactions and lower fees, it aims to be more practical for everyday payments. Retailers and payment processors are increasingly turning to Bitcoin Cash as an option for customers, which strengthens its role as a true transactional crypto. For whales, BCH represents a utility coin that may not carry the explosive presale hype of APC but still offers steady adoption. Its value lies in being usable across markets where fast, affordable crypto payments are becoming the norm. As more businesses and users experiment with blockchain for payments, Bitcoin Cash remains a viable tool in the mix of best new cryptos for exponential returns. Conclusion The final stage of Arctic Pablo Coin’s presale has become a spectacle that whales cannot ignore. With the FINAL400 code delivering 5x tokens at $0.0012 and ROI projections reaching as high as 8233 percent, it’s no surprise that the Frozen Finale is creating waves across the crypto community. The mix of myth, mechanics, and deflationary design makes APC stand apart as the most thrilling meme coin presale currently live. Chainlink and Bitcoin Cash also deserve their mentions. Chainlink continues to expand its role as the bridge between blockchains and real-world data, while Bitcoin Cash pushes the case for everyday crypto adoption through speed and affordability. Both play important roles, but it’s Arctic Pablo Coin’s presale finale that has whales buzzing louder than ever. For those hunting the best new cryptos for exponential returns , the message is clear. Chainlink and Bitcoin Cash provide proven strength, but Arctic Pablo Coin’s Frozen Finale offers a closing act that could turn allocations into millions.

The FINAL400 code multiplies every purchase by five, giving investors 400 percent more tokens. It’s active only during Stage 40, the Frozen Finale, and ends once the presale closes. Why are whales interested in Arctic Pablo Coin? Crypto whales are attracted to the massive ROI projections. At $0.0012, tokens can multiply 567 percent by listing and 8233 percent at analyst targets, with bonuses making allocations even larger. What is the difference between Arctic Pablo Coin and a typical meme coin presale? Unlike standard meme coin projects, Arctic Pablo Coin combines narrative-driven branding with real mechanics like staking, token burns, and referral programs. This mix of story and structure adds depth. Is Chainlink still considered essential for DeFi? Yes. Chainlink’s decentralized oracles provide accurate real-world data, which is crucial for DeFi protocols, NFT projects, and other blockchain systems that rely on external information. How is Bitcoin Cash being used today? Bitcoin Cash is increasingly being adopted for everyday payments due to its faster transaction times and lower fees, making it practical for retailers and users seeking efficiency. Summary Arctic Pablo Coin’s Stage 40 Frozen Finale is reshaping what a presale can deliver. With a 400 percent FINAL400 bonus, whales are rushing to capture ROI potential that stretches beyond 8233 percent. Chainlink continues to power blockchain infrastructure with reliable oracles, while Bitcoin Cash strengthens its role as a payments-focused cryptocurrency. Together, they outline a diverse market, but it’s APC’s finale that stands out as the most electrifying opportunity among the best new cryptos for exponential returns.

At the same time, MAGACOIN FINANCE is catching attention as a top altcoin pick to ride alongside Bitcoin’s run. Whales dump $12.7B Bitcoin, pressuring short-term prices Bitcoin whales sold over 115,000 BTC worth $12.7 billion in the past month — the biggest sell-off since mid-2022. According to analysts at CryptoQuant, this wave of selling shows large holders are cutting risk exposure, which has pushed Bitcoin below $108,000 in recent weeks. Despite this pressure, many say the outlook for Bitcoin hasn’t changed. Data shows whale selling has slowed, with the seven-day balance drop easing from 95,000 BTC to 38,000 BTC. Meanwhile, institutional buying has helped balance out the selling. While short-term moves may stay choppy, Bitcoin has only corrected 13% from its record high, far less than past pullbacks. Analysts keep $150K–$250K Bitcoin forecasts alive Even with whales selling, experts believe Bitcoin is on track for bigger gains. Canary Capital CEO Steven McClurg says there’s more than a 50% chance Bitcoin hits $150K this year, thanks to treasury inflows and ETF demand. Michael Saylor also noted that most equity analysts see Bitcoin reaching $150K by Christmas. Adding to the bullish outlook, Tom Lee of Fundstrat Global reaffirmed his $250K target for Bitcoin by Christmas 2025. He highlighted Bitcoin’s history of fourth-quarter rallies and pointed to the Fed’s September rate decision as a key trigger. Together, these predictions show that analysts still believe Bitcoin’s path is upward, even in the face of recent whale pressure. MAGACOIN FINANCE: altcoin pick to ride Bitcoin’s $250K journey Amid Bitcoin momentum, analysts say smaller altcoins can move faster. MAGACOIN FINANCE is one that has been named as a top pick to buy alongside Bitcoin. Unlike Bitcoin, which already has a huge market cap, MAGACOIN FINANCE is newer and undervalued, which gives it room to grow at a quicker pace. Why MAGACOIN FINANCE: Smaller and newer, making 120X moves faster than Bitcoin Analyst pick as a top coin to diversify with Thousands of holders already in early Seen as a hedge for those who missed earlier Bitcoin runs For those looking to diversify while betting on Bitcoin’s path to $250K, this altcoin is one to watch closely. How traders can position now Bitcoin’s long-term forecast remains bullish despite short-term whale selling. Traders looking to position for the next big run should consider both Bitcoin and newer altcoins like MAGACOIN FINANCE. Acting early gives the best chance to benefit from upcoming moves.

Here’s why,https://timestabloid.com/expert-to-xrp-holders-the-next-leg-up-will-be-violent-heres-why/,"Gordon (@AltcoinGordon), a popular crypto pundit, believes XRP is nearing a decisive move. Backed by two weeks of steady accumulation from buyers, he suggested that the next phase of price action could be “violent,” pointing to a possible breakout after a period of consolidation and recovery. XRP’s Recent Price Performance XRP faced a notable downturn in late August. This poor performance remained until September, when its price hit a low point of $2.71 on September 1. Despite this correction, XRP’s price action shifted positively in the following weeks. By September 7, it had recovered, regaining stability just below $3 . The rebound signaled that buyers were returning to defend key levels after weeks of pressure. Since that recovery, XRP has struggled to break cleanly through $3.1, which now acts as a zone of resistance. The price has tested this level repeatedly without a sustained breakout. At the same time, the $2.90 area has held firm as a support zone, giving XRP a clear range in which its next move will be defined. Traders remain watchful of whether momentum from the recent bounce can translate into a breakout above resistance. 2 solid weeks of BUYING from the $XRP Army. The next leg up will be VIOLENT. Do you understand? pic.twitter.com/VzGKIPYSJP — Gordon (@AltcoinGordon) September 12, 2025 The Pattern on the Chart The chart Gordon shared provides further clarity on why he expects a significant move. It shows that XRP broke out of a long-term downtrend in July, climbing to an all-time high of $3.65 . The decline into late August represented a corrective phase, forming a shorter-term descending trendline. This line of resistance has now been tested multiple times, with the latest weekly candle showing strength above $3 and closing in on that descending barrier. This setup indicates that XRP is approaching a breakout point. A sustained push above $3.1 would end the short-term downtrend and confirm renewed positive momentum. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 What’s Next for XRP? If buyers maintain their position, the asset could target its all-time high again, and potentially create a new one before the end of September. Conversely, if XRP fails to overcome this structure, it risks dropping back to the $2.8 range. Gordon’s confidence rests on the consistent buying pressure over the past two weeks. Multiple weekly green candles suggest that accumulation is underway, and traders are positioning ahead of a potential breakout . His description of the next leg as “violent” highlights expectations of a strong upward move once resistance is cleared.

With momentum now building, the focus has shifted to the next major test: the $117,000 resistance level. A decisive move above this threshold would not only confirm the continuation of the current rally but also set the stage for a potential run toward new highs. Daily Support Flip Confirms Bullish Control Alpha Crypto Signal, in a recent market update, pointed out that BTC is showing renewed strength on the daily timeframe. The leading cryptocurrency successfully flipped a key horizontal zone into support, a move that highlights growing buyer dominance in the market. This structural shift is seen as a positive development for bulls, laying the groundwork for further upside momentum. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Flashes ‘Rarest Signal’ Ever, Is A 100% Rally Possible? With buyers firmly in control, Bitcoin’s price action is now being driven higher toward the previous swing high near $117,000. This level has emerged as the next significant hurdle for bulls, acting as a critical area where market sentiment could either extend the rally or spark profit-taking. The analysis further noted that if Bitcoin manages to push above $117,000, the level itself could turn into an attractive area for potential short setups. However, such a strategy carries risks, as the invalidation point would be a decisive breakout above BTC’s all-time high. Until then, $117,000 stands out as the key level of interest for market participants. How Bitcoin reacts in this zone will determine whether it consolidates, faces rejection, or surges higher. For traders, this level offers a critical point to evaluate possible entries, exits, and positioning as the next major move takes shape. Bitcoin Struggles To Secure A Hold Above $116,000 According to a recent post by Crypto VIP Signal, Bitcoin is continuing its upward trajectory. However, the cryptocurrency has not yet been able to firmly hold above the $116,000 level, which suggests that while the overall trend is bullish, buyers have yet to fully overcome this significant hurdle. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Recovery Hopes Rise – Can Bulls Push It Past Resistance? Crypto VIP Signal’s analysis notes that the entire market is looking positive, but a temporary slowdown can be expected. This is primarily attributed to a decline in trading volume, which is a common occurrence on weekends as activity from institutional traders and large investors often lessens. Given these conditions, Crypto VIP Signal predicts that Bitcoin will likely experience a period of sideways movement. The consolidation phase would allow the market to digest recent gains and build the necessary momentum to attempt another push past the $116,000 resistance.

When we talk about USDT minted , we are referring to the creation of new Tether tokens. USDT is the largest stablecoin by market capitalization, designed to maintain a 1:1 peg with the US dollar. Tether Treasury is the entity responsible for issuing and redeeming these tokens. Minting Process: New USDT tokens are typically minted when users or institutions deposit fiat currency (like USD) with Tether. This process increases the total supply of USDT in circulation. Purpose: The primary purpose is to meet demand for stablecoin liquidity in the crypto market. Traders use USDT to quickly move in and out of volatile cryptocurrencies without converting back to fiat, and for arbitrage opportunities. Market Signal: A large issuance often suggests an increased demand for stablecoins, indicating that more capital is potentially preparing to enter or move within the crypto market. Therefore, this 1 billion USDT minted event represents a substantial injection of potential buying power into the digital asset space. How Does Massive USDT Minting Impact the Crypto Market? The issuance of a significant amount of USDT can have various ripple effects across the cryptocurrency landscape. While not a direct causation, it often correlates with increased market activity. Historically, large USDT issuances have sometimes preceded periods of market rallies for cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum. This is because the newly minted USDT can be used to purchase these assets, thereby increasing demand and potentially their prices. Consider these points: Increased Liquidity: More USDT means more capital available for trading pairs, making it easier to execute large trades without significant price slippage. Potential Buying Pressure: If the newly minted USDT is deployed to buy other cryptocurrencies, it can create upward price pressure. Market Sentiment: Such events are often interpreted as a bullish signal, reflecting confidence from large investors or institutions. However, it is also important to note that the actual impact depends on how this newly available USDT is utilized. It might sit in exchange wallets or be used for other purposes. Tether’s Central Role and Transparency Discussions Tether holds a dominant position in the stablecoin market, making any major event like 1 billion USDT minted particularly noteworthy. Its widespread adoption across exchanges and trading platforms solidifies its importance. The company has faced ongoing discussions regarding the composition and transparency of its reserves, which back the USDT tokens. While Tether regularly publishes attestations of its reserves, some market participants continue to call for full, independent audits. This conversation is an important aspect of the stablecoin ecosystem, emphasizing the need for robust financial backing. The continued issuance of large amounts of USDT minted tokens underscores Tether’s critical function in providing stability and liquidity to the volatile crypto markets, despite these ongoing dialogues about its operational transparency. Navigating the Future: What to Watch After This USDT Minted Event? For investors and traders, monitoring the aftermath of a significant USDT minted event offers actionable insights. Observing how this newly available capital moves through the blockchain can provide clues about future market directions. Here’s what to keep an eye on: On-Chain Flows: Track where the minted USDT is sent. Is it moving to exchanges, or being held in large wallets? Trading Volume: Look for increases in trading volumes for major cryptocurrencies, particularly Bitcoin and Ethereum, as this could indicate the deployment of new capital. Market Depth: Assess if market depth on exchanges improves, suggesting more liquidity. Ultimately, while the 1 billion USDT minted is a significant data point, its true impact will unfold as market participants decide how to utilize this fresh injection of stablecoin liquidity. Staying informed and analyzing subsequent market movements is key. In conclusion, the recent issuance of 1 billion USDT minted by Tether Treasury is a powerful indicator of demand for stablecoin liquidity within the cryptocurrency market. It highlights Tether’s continued relevance and prompts market participants to closely observe potential shifts in asset prices and trading dynamics. These large-scale minting events serve as crucial checkpoints for understanding the evolving landscape of digital finance. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) What does it mean when USDT is ‘minted’? When USDT is ‘minted,’ it means new Tether tokens are created and added to the total supply. This usually happens when users or institutions deposit fiat currency (like US dollars) with Tether, requesting an equivalent amount of USDT in return. Why does Tether mint such large amounts of USDT? Tether mints large amounts of USDT to meet the growing demand for stablecoin liquidity in the cryptocurrency market. This demand comes from traders, institutions, and platforms needing a stable asset for trading, hedging, and transferring value efficiently across exchanges. Does a large USDT minting always lead to a crypto price rally? Not always. While large USDT minting events often correlate with increased buying pressure and can precede price rallies, it’s not a guaranteed outcome. The minted USDT might be used for various purposes, including holding, arbitrage, or institutional transactions, and its impact on prices depends on how it is deployed. Where can I track USDT minting events? Services like Whale Alert often report significant USDT minting events. You can also monitor Tether’s official transparency report or use blockchain explorers that track the Tether Treasury wallet for real-time data on supply changes. What is the role of Tether Treasury in the crypto ecosystem? Tether Treasury acts as the issuer and redeemer of USDT tokens. Its role is to manage the supply of USDT, ensuring that new tokens are created against reserves and that tokens can be redeemed for fiat currency, thereby maintaining the stablecoin’s peg to the US dollar.

Internet Computer protocol price forecast for 2028 expects the token to reach a peak price of $23.39. By 2031, the price of Internet Computer might reach a maximum of $38.01. Internet Computer (ICP) is a groundbreaking blockchain network developed by the DFINITY Foundation. It aims to extend the functionality of the internet, enabling it to host backend software and transforming it into a global, decentralized computer. Internet computer blockchain incorporates advanced cryptography and innovative technology to provide scalable, efficient, and secure decentralized applications (dApps). Given its robust technology and expanding utility, the Internet Computer blockchain’s future price prospects look promising. As more developers build on the platform and adoption increases, ICP token demand will likely rise. Does Internet Computer coin have a future? How much will Internet Computer coin cost in 2025? Will ICP reach $1000? Let’s get into the current price analysis and predictions. Overview Cryptocurrency Internet Computer Token ICP Price $4.96 Market Cap $2.67B Trading Volume $61.83M Circulating Supply 538.03M ICP All-time High $750.73 (May 10, 2021) All-time Low $2.86 (Sep 2023) 24-h High $5.16 24-h Low $4.97 Internet Computer Network technical analysis Metric Value Volatility (30-day period) 4.93% 14-Day RSI 47.15 50-Day SMA $5.20 Sentiment Bearish Fear & Greed Index 52 (Neutral) Green Days 13/30 (43%) 200-Day SMA $5.43 Internet Computer price analysis TL;DR Breakdown ICP failed to break above $5.13–$5.16 resistance and is now pulling back. Daily indicators show waning momentum, though MACD remains slightly bullish. ICP 1-day price analysis As of September 4, ICP is trading around $5.00 after retesting the $5.13 resistance on the daily chart and getting rejected. The rejection happened after a steady move from the $4.65 range which has been strong support for ICP. The Bollinger Bands are showing ICP pressuring the upper band at $5.13 with today’s red candle indicating sellers are coming in. ICPUSDT 1-day price chart by TradingView The RSI is currently sitting around 45 which definitely puts ICP in neutral and allows for a breakout or a pullback to develop, while the MACD just crossed into positive territory today; however, looking at the histogram a slight flattening of momentum is present which indicates some caution. If bulls defend the support at $4.89, we may see another retest of the $5.13 – $5.20 region. If price were to drop below the $4.89 level, we could then expect further downside on the $4.65 level. ICP 4-hour price analysis On the 4-hour chart, ICP has slid from $5.16 and is currently testing support near $4.95, where the 21-period SMA is also located. The rejection at $5.16 indicates strong supply in the overall price action capping any upside. Should buyers not defend the support at $4.95, ICP has the potential to slide down to deeper supports at $4.81 and potentially $4.68. ICPUSDT 4-hour price chart by TradingView Volume has significantly decreased since the last push up, and OBV has been declining since, indicating a decreasing accumulation pressure. For bulls to take back control over the price action, we will need to see ICP reclaim $5.05 quickly and trade strongly above $5.16 with volume. Until we see that happen, it looks like ICP will consolidate between $4.81 and $5.16, with sellers holding the upper hand short term. ICP technical indicators: Levels and action Daily simple moving average (SMA) Period Value Action SMA 3 $4.92 BUY SMA 5 $4.97 BUY SMA 10 $4.95 BUY SMA 21 $4.99 BUY SMA 50 $5.20 SELL SMA 100 $5.23 SELL SMA 200 $5.43 SELL Daily exponential moving average (EMA) Period Value Action EMA 3 $4.84 BUY EMA 5 $4.87 BUY EMA 10 $4.96 BUY EMA 21 $5.10 SELL EMA 50 $5.23 SELL EMA 100 $5.34 SELL EMA 200 $5.89 SELL What to expect from ICP price analysis ICP is at a key decision point around $5. A hold above $4.95 keeps the door open for another test of $5.13–$5.16, with a breakout eyeing $5.30. Losing $4.95, however, shifts momentum bearish, exposing $4.81 and $4.68. For now, consolidation looks most likely until a clear breakout decides the next trend. Is Internet Computer a good investment?

This movement has seen the meme cryptocurrency make a push towards the upper end of a consolidation range in the daily candlestick timeframe chart. A recent analysis shared on TradingView by The_Alchemist_Trader points to a possible shift in momentum, as Dogecoin is retesting its point of control with a bullish reaction that might push it to $0.35 in the short term and as high as $0.6 in the long term. Related Reading: Dogecoin Defies Odds, Jumps 21% Even As ETF Debut Gets Pushed Back Dogecoin Retesting Point Of Control According to the analysis, Dogecoin is currently testing its point of control, a high-volume resistance area that has defined much of its trading structure in recent months. This price action goes as far back as February with well-defined upper and lower trendlines. Interestingly, price action volume in the past 48 hours shows that buyers are stepping in aggressively at the mid-level of this range, which is around $0.25. This is very important, and a daily close above the point of control with strong volume would translate from range-bound movement to a defined upward rally. This bullish reaction comes after Dogecoin bounced at $0.2 last week, a move that created a solid foundation for another leg upward. Now, according to the analyst, the next thing is for Dogecoin to make a close basis above its point of control resistance. Roadmap To $0.35 Through Fibonacci Levels Fibonacci extension levels have served as reliable indicators of profit-taking and continuation levels for Dogecoin in the current cycles. As such, many analysts are fond of pointing to price targets at notable Fib levels. In this case, the analyst noted that a successful breakout above the point of control at $0.25 opens the path toward the 0.618 Fibonacci retracement level. This level, which is positioned around $0.35, stands out as the primary upside target in the current setup. The chart below shows a projected rally pattern for this breakout with a clear roadmap drawn to the 0.618 Fibonacci extension level. This also includes extensions to the $0.36 price level at the 0.66 Fib extension and the $0.4 price level at the 0.786 Fib extension if the momentum continues. A move toward $0.35 would represent not just a technical price target but also a strong confirmation that Dogecoin has reestablished bullish dominance above its consolidation range since February. From here, Dogecoin could start holding up above $0.3 again. Related Reading: ETF Dreams For Dogecoin: Serious Possibility Or Just Hype? Dogecoin’s short-term movement is now tilted to the upside, provided the price continues to close above the point of control with strong participation from buyers. Volume is the most important thing here, as a breakout without sufficient backing could result in a false move and cause Dogecoin to return to range trading. At the time of writing, Dogecoin is about to break above the upper trendline of its multi-month range. Dogecoin is currently trading at $0.2874, up by 12.6% and 33% in the past 24 hours and seven days, respectively.

According to his analysis, this level is significant because it aligns with the 21 SMA (simple moving average). Egrag Crypto noted that this retest has now been completed, making $3.07 the critical price point that must be closely monitored. He emphasized that a decisive close above this level is required to confirm a breakout from the symmetrical triangle pattern outlined in his charts. #XRP – The Retest of $3.07 Near the 21 SMA is Completed: We’re currently observing a retest of the $3.07 level, which is crucial as it aligns with the 21 SMA (Simple Moving Average). For a #Bullish signal, we need a clear close above $3.07 to confirm the break-out from the… pic.twitter.com/XNdCrgK4Fe — EGRAG CRYPTO (@egragcrypto) September 12, 2025 Technical Observations Egrag’s charts illustrate the symmetrical triangle that has formed, with $3.07 positioned at the point of convergence between the triangle’s upper boundary and the moving average. The first chart he shared was labeled with the 21 SMA, while the latter chart displayed the 21 EMA. Despite the labeling differences, his commentary referred broadly to the 21 SMA as the reference point. The visuals also reveal resistance areas above $3.07, with potential upside targets in the $3.30 to $4.20 range, while downside risk levels remain visible near $2.55 and $2.00. Conditions for Bullish Confirmation Egrag explained that the confirmation of a bullish move depends entirely on a clear close above $3.07. Without this confirmation, the symmetrical triangle remains unresolved, and the market could still test the lower support levels. He advised traders to wait for the breakout signal before making moves, highlighting that acting prematurely could expose positions to unnecessary risk. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Moving Forward The update underscores that XRP’s immediate future depends on whether it can establish a solid position above $3.07. A breakout and close above this point would open the pathway toward the higher levels identified in Egrag’s charts. Conversely, failure to achieve this could result in renewed downward pressure, leaving the $2.55 and $2.00 levels as potential areas of support. By providing two updated charts, Egrag Crypto highlighted that traders should view the 21 moving averages as a decisive line in this setup, regardless of whether it is described as SMA or EMA. As the retest is completed, the market now waits for a decisive close to determine a bullish breakout. Until that condition is met, patience remains essential, and positions should only be taken once the breakout has been validated.

At the same time, bitcoin has lost some ground to silver, and it’s currently in the 8th position. Ripple Is Back CryptoPotato reported back on August 23 that XRP had found a place within the aforementioned ranking, as, at the time, it had become the 99th biggest asset on CompaniesMarketCap. The following few weeks were quite turbulent for the entire cryptocurrency market, and XRP was not spared. The cross-border token dipped in price from $3.02, which was enough to keep its market cap around $180 billion, to a multi-month low of $2.70. Consequently, the asset fell out of that coveted group. However, the crypto market has been on a strong rebound in the past week. XRP is no exception, as it has jumped by 10% and now trades at $3.10 after it was rejected yesterday at $3.20 . Still, its market cap is up to $185 billion, which makes it the 94th largest global asset by that metric. It has surpassed the likes of Citigroup, Xiaomi, and Airbus on the way up, while some of the next big names in its scope are Verizon, Shopify, Commonwealth Bank, and Uber. Assets by Market Cap. Source: CompaniesMarketCap BTC Battles Silver As the market leader and largest in the industry, BTC was the first to enter the top 100 assets. Its growth over the past several years has pushed it into the largest 10. Although at one point it had climbed above silver and Amazon and was aiming at fifth, it has lost some ground, while the aforementioned duo has been on an uptrend (especially the precious metal). Now, bitcoin’s market cap stands at just over $2.3 trillion, which makes it the 8th largest global asset. Silver is above it with a market cap of $2.4 trillion. Gold continues to be the undisputed leader with a market cap of nearly $25 trillion after it marked a new all-time high against the greenback earlier this week. Ethereum’s recent meteoric rise has driven it to the 22nd spot in this ranking, slightly above Mastercard and Netflix, and behind Visa and Tencent.

Here’s why,https://timestabloid.com/pundit-october-could-be-the-biggest-month-in-xrp-history-heres-why/,"Crypto investor Armando Pantoja, also known as Tall Guy Tycoon, has suggested that October could be the most significant month in XRP’s history. In a recent video shared on X, he stated that XRP might be approaching a critical moment that few are openly addressing. Pantoja explained that between October 18 and October 25, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission is set to review seven XRP-related filings. He described this review window as potentially decisive, with outcomes that could reshape XRP’s position in the digital asset market. #XRP : Could October be the biggest month in $XRP History?? pic.twitter.com/aPcLj0KtEr — Armando Pantoja (@_TallGuyTycoon) September 11, 2025 ETF Approval Probabilities Pantoja noted that PolyMark has placed the likelihood of approval for an XRP exchange-traded fund at 95%, a figure he described as extremely favorable. He drew a comparison to Bitcoin, pointing out that the leading cryptocurrency rose by 52% in the months following its own ETF approval. According to his assessment, the implication is that XRP could experience a similar trajectory if granted the same level of regulatory recognition. He emphasized that such an event could introduce a new phase of market momentum for the asset. Institutional Signals Another key factor highlighted by Pantoja was the rapid increase in XRP futures activity. He reported that open interest in XRP futures has climbed by 74%, which he interprets as a signal that institutional investors are positioning themselves ahead of a potential major development. He stressed that this level of engagement from larger market participants suggests anticipation of substantial movement in XRP’s valuation. Retail Participation and Market Potential In his video, Pantoja recalled XRP’s prior rise from $0.50 to nearly $4. He emphasized that during that surge, trading volumes remained close to historic averages, a sign that retail investors were not heavily involved in the move. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 He pointed to this as a positive factor, arguing that the market still has untapped potential if retail participation increases. He stated that his personal target range for XRP lies between $8 and $12 in the current cycle, while adding that an ETF approval could create conditions for surpassing that range. Pantoja concluded his remarks by questioning whether October would be the month when XRP definitively proves itself in the market. He left viewers with the consideration that regulatory decisions, institutional signals, and market conditions are aligning in a way that makes this period especially critical for XRP.

His post, titled “The Power of the Waves”, highlights significant Fibonacci targets while emphasizing that XRP is currently breaking through its initial weekly resistance. ""The Power of the Waves"" Initial weekly resistance is being broken right now. #XRP targets, $4.39 and the $5.85 Fibonacci levels Supports: $3.01, $2.85. As clear as it gets. pic.twitter.com/MjaAqczjSU — Dark Defender (@DefendDark) September 12, 2025 Price Targets and Resistance Levels In the update, Dark Defender identified $4.39 and $5.85 as the next major price targets based on the Fibonacci retracement levels. He specified that the $4.39 level corresponds with the 161.80% extension, while the $5.85 target represents the 261.80% extension. According to his chart, XRP is moving past a crucial resistance area, indicating that the path toward higher price zones could be opening if momentum continues. The analysis further illustrates how XRP has been following a wave structure pattern. Dark Defender labeled previous corrections and outlined the current cycle, suggesting that the digital asset may be entering the next upward phase. His projection shows the possibility of XRP rising beyond its recent range if the breakout sustains. Support Zones While pointing to higher price projections, Dark Defender also outlined critical support levels. He highlighted $3.01 and $2.85 as areas where XRP could find buying strength if the market experiences a pullback. These levels were noted as important reference points to watch, as they could provide stability before any attempt to reach the higher Fibonacci extensions. The chart attached to his post also displayed a broader range of Fibonacci zones, with additional retracement points around $1.88 on the downside and further extensions mapped out above $5.00 . This suggests that Dark Defender is considering both upward momentum and possible corrections within the structure of the ongoing cycle. Community Response Followers of Dark Defender reacted to the analysis with optimism. A user named Blue Tears commented that “The target price is like a rocket, the support level is as solid as a steel plate, and we will see a new wave soon.” Another community member, SelinaQueen, expressed appreciation for the detailed breakdown. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 The responses reflect a strong interest in the outlined targets, with many looking closely at whether XRP can maintain its momentum and achieve the projected Fibonacci extensions. Dark Defender’s technical outlook underscores the importance of both resistance breakthroughs and support confirmations in XRP’s ongoing price action. With the $4.39 and $5.85 levels marked as the next potential upside goals, attention now turns to whether XRP can sustain its current trajectory while maintaining support above $3.01 and $2.85. As the market progresses, XRP’s reaction to these critical levels will provide further clarity on whether the wave structure aligns with Dark Defender’s projections.

One of them is Little Pepe (LILPEPE), and at present, it is rocking its structurally sound yet meme-driven Layer 2 ecosystem. As its presale approaches taking a final shape, some analysts believe that LILPEPE will make an exceptional project in 2025. Little Pepe (LILPEPE): A Meme Coin With Real Utility Unlike most meme tokens, Little Pepe (LILPEPE) is built on a next-generation Layer 2 blockchain explicitly designed for meme culture. The project blends low fees, fast transaction finality, and strong security while offering features rarely seen in other meme projects, such as sniper-bot resistance and a dedicated memes launchpad. This unique combination could set LILPEPE apart in a crowded market. The presale is already in Stage 12, priced at $0.0021 per token, and is almost entirely sold out. Data shows that over 97% of tokens have been purchased, with $24,565,284 raised out of a $25,475,000 target. More than 15.3 billion tokens have already been sold, signalling strong early demand and community momentum. At listing, the token is expected to debut at $0.003, offering early buyers potential upside even before exchange expansion. Beyond tokenomics, Little Pepe is also running one of the most aggressive promotional campaigns in the meme coin sector. Its Mega Giveaway rewards top buyers across Stages 12–17 with more than 15 ETH in prizes. The largest buyer may receive 5 ETH, while additional rewards are distributed among the second, third, and 15 randomly selected participants. Combined with the already announced $77,000 giveaway for 10 winners, this initiative reinforces Little Pepe’s focus on rewarding community commitment. Cardano (ADA): The Long-Term Builder One of the most studied blockchain projects in the sector is currently Cardano (ADA). With a peer-reviewed model and a proof-of-stake blockchain, through the years, Cardano has grown its ecosystem by adding smart contracts, decentralized applications, and DeFi integrations. Despite the increasing trend of ADA, it is more of a long-term strategy of development rather than a spike. Investors who are looking at near-term returns may still find value in ADA if the market conditions become more bullish. But its trend would imply lower compounding returns instead of a 10x potential in a brief period, such as 80 days. Ripple (XRP): Steering Clear of Regulation. Ripple (XRP) has always been a bridge currency to the financial institutions around the world. Its use of cross-border payments is also not old-fashioned, and the end of its high-profile regulatory dispute in the United States may assist XRP to have a brighter future. It is not uncommon to find market participants arguing that a favorable environment would restore XRP to the limelight. Yet, XRP’s growth may depend heavily on legal and institutional developments. While the token has the liquidity and infrastructure to rise, its performance in the next 80 days may be constrained compared to newer entrants capturing speculative attention. Why LILPEPE May Outperform The value proposition of Little Pepe (LILPEPE) is entirely different than that of Cardano (ADA) and Ripple (XRP). Whereas ADA and XRP must rely on gradual but consistent adoption, LILPEPE has access to the virality of meme culture, as well as concrete blockchain innovation. Its virtually sold-out presale, coupled with the buzz surrounding giveaways and exchange listings, indicates that it could have greater near-term upside potential. Conclusion Cardano (ADA) and Ripple (XRP) continue to be essential contenders in blockchain and have their own advantages in technology and payments. Nevertheless, Little Pepe (LILPEPE) may become a more dynamic project within 80 days because of its presale energy and other incentives driven by the community and Layer 2 meme-specific ecosystem. While speculative, data indicate that LILPEPE may hold the strongest position among the three for investors seeking rapid gains.

Expectedly for a weekend trading, most altcoins are quite sluggish with little to no moves in either direction. However, there are a few exceptions. BTC Keeps Calm at $116K The aforementioned price recovery began at the start of the current month when bitcoin slumped to a multi-week low of just over $107,000. The asset tested that support on a couple of occasions in just a few days at the time. However, the bulls ultimately managed to defend it and initiated leg-ups that drove BTC to over $110,000 within days. It kept climbing and challenged $113,000 on September 5 and 9, where it faced immediate rejections. Nevertheless, that level finally gave in on September 1,0 and BTC hasn’t looked back since. Just the opposite, it kept rising and knocked on the $116,000 door on Friday. The bulls pushed it beyond that level on Saturday morning and up to a multi-week high of $116,700, but the cryptocurrency failed to move upwards. It has been driven to just under $116,000 as of press time, which is still impressive given the latest macroeconomic developments and threats on the USA vs Russia/China front from yesterday. For now, BTC’s market cap is still above the $2.3 trillion mark, while its dominance over the alts has recovered some ground and is up to 55.4% on CG. BTCUSD. Source: TradingView PUMP Pumps As mentioned above, there’s little volatility from the larger-cap alts. Ethereum was stopped at over $4,700 yesterday and now sits below that level after a 1% daily decline. LINK, HYPE, XLM, TRX, and ADA are also slightly in the red. In contrast, XRP, SOL, BNB, DOGE, and SUI are with insignificant gains. In contrast, M has resumed its massive rally and is up to over $2.5 after another 9% surge. WLFI is up by 8% and sits at $0.22. PUMP has stolen the show with a massive 22% surge daily, which has pushed its price to $0.008. The total crypto market cap, though, has lost around $30 billion since yesterday and is down to $4.160 trillion on CG. Cryptocurrency Market Overview.

In a post on X, he shared how the company’s Return on Investment ( ROI) from Bitcoin, open interest, and its treasury expansion have beaten that of the heavyweights in tech. He even commented, “Bitcoin is more interesting than the Magnificent 7.” Saylor posted a chart comparing open interest to the market cap To illustrate Bitcoin’s impact, Saylor shared a chart comparing open interest to market cap. MicroStrategy came in first at 100.5%, trouncing Tesla’s 26% and the rest of the Magnificent 7, including Nvidia, Meta, Alphabet, Apple, Amazon, and Microsoft. Earlier this month, in a further comparison, Saylor stacked MicroStrategy’s performance against Bitcoin, SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (SPY), Vanguard Real Estate ETF (VNQ), and Vanguard Total Bond Market ETF (BND). This came after the company was excluded from the S&P 500 index. At the time, he also showed a chart on annualized returns with MicroStrategy topping the list at 91%. It outperformed Nvidia’s 72% and Tesla’s 32%. After that came Alphabet, which posted 26% and Meta 23%, with Microsoft, Apple, and Amazon reporting significantly lower numbers. Source: Strategy Responding to Saylor’s post, Thomas Lee of Fundstrat weighed in, arguing that Bitcoin and Ethereum have been more resilient themes than AI or cybersecurity. He likened Strategy to a “granny shot ETF,” to mean it offers investors a simple, accessible path to Bitcoin exposure through traditional markets. As previously reported by Cryptopolitan, investors have been becoming more hopeful of Strategy’s potential inclusion in the S&P 500 , which some consider as a way to acknowledge that the company has won itself international attention. Its omission, though, delays the added visibility and passive inflows that normally accompany such a listing. Strategy has accumulated over 638000 Bitcoin Stock market heroes The Magnificent Seven have had a tough time in 2025, and that’s saying something as their role in stoking stock market gains has been legendary. Apple and Microsoft are working through tighter regulatory scrutiny, Amazon is facing slowing consumer demand, and Tesla is still dealing with increasing competition in electric vehicles. Nvidia remains a bright spot, with demand for AI chips driving revenue even higher, but its stock gains this year have failed to keep up with prior explosive run-ups. Alphabet and Meta, meanwhile, are competing for digital advertising with TikTok and other platforms that are wooing users. Compared to the Magnificent 7, Strategy’s story is cleaner. The company is still adding to its Bitcoin stack. BitcoinTreasuries.NET reported that around 12 firms expanded their holdings in the past week, led by Strategy’s 1,955 BTC buy. Gemini added 1,191 BTC, while Bitdeer in Singapore accumulated 333.5 BTC. Metaplanet (Japan), Cango (China), and Volcon (U.S.) also added to their Bitcoin positions. Meanwhile, steady but smaller allocations came from Smarter Web in the UK, Exodus, Canaan, Anap Holdings, H100 Group, and DigitalX. Data from BitcoinTreasuries.NET shows that the 100 largest public holders collectively control 1,009,202 BTC, worth over $117 billion today. Businesses worldwide, from Asia to Europe to the U.S., are positioning Bitcoin as a strategic part of their balance sheets. So far, Strategy has 638,460 BTC holdings, after the 1955 BTC purchase for approximately $217.4 million at an average price of $111,196. Per executive chairman Saylor, the firm spent around $47.2 billion (fees included) to acquire its Bitcoin holdings at an average price of $73,880 — now worth about $71 billion. Strategy has primarily financed the buys using capital raised through ATM sales of MSTR shares and perpetual preferred issues STRK and STRF. STRD offers the highest risk-reward trade-off, with a 10% non-cumulative dividend. STRK is convertible, paying 8%, and includes equity participation. STRF is non-convertible but pays a secure 10% cumulative dividend. STRC is a variable-rate preferred with monthly distributions pegged near par. Year-to-date, Strategy stock remains one of the Nasdaq’s best-performing stocks as Bitcoin adoption and demand for crypto-based equities continue to increase. Saylor attributes the company’s adoption of the “Bitcoin Standard”, a corporate strategy pursued since 2020, to insulating shareholder value to levels well beyond that seen in traditional tech stocks.

The analyst’s primary expectation is for more gains to follow as the ETH/BTC pair begins to surge. This key relationship is a central focus for the analyst, as a strong performance from Ethereum against BTC often signals a broader bullish period for ETH itself. ETH And ETHBTC Daily Candles Flash Strong Bullish Close Giving a detailed market update, CRYPTOWZRD highlighted that both Ethereum’s daily candle and the ETHBTC pair closed strongly bullish. ETHBTC’s surge occurred as Bitcoin’s dominance weakened, providing altcoins with room to build momentum. This shift marked a significant move for Ethereum, reflecting renewed strength in the broader market structure. Related Reading: Ethereum (ETH) On The Brink Of A Major Supply Crisis: What It Means For Investors According to his analysis, ETHBTC successfully broke out of its daily falling wedge pattern, a move that often signals the start of a bullish reversal. Ethereum mirrored this strength, pushing higher alongside the breakout, which further reinforced optimism among traders who have been watching closely for signs of sustained upside momentum. Examining key levels, CRYPTOWZRD highlighted that $5,000 remains the primary daily resistance for Ethereum. A decisive break above this threshold could ignite an impulsive rally, potentially driving ETH toward the $5,780 resistance zone or even higher. On the downside, $4,000 is seen as the critical daily support, providing a safety net for bulls should price action cool off in the short term. Despite the strong outlook, he noted that his primary focus will stay on the lower time frame chart formations for tomorrow, as these provide opportunities for quick scalps and short-term trades. However, with the weekend approaching, CRYPTOWZRD is maintaining a rational stance. Volatility Offers Both Risk And Opportunity In The Current Setup Crypto analyst CRYPTOWZRD has stated that the intraday chart for Ethereum is showing significant volatility, with more expected in the near term. This high level of fluctuation is something he is prepared for and is a normal part of the market as it searches for a new direction. Related Reading: Ethereum Bulls on the Back Foot – Can Momentum Return Soon? In the meantime, CRYPTOWZRD has outlined two potential scenarios. If BTC’s price pulls back toward the $4,500 level, it will then show a clear bullish reversal. Another scenario would be if Ethereum holds strong and breaks above the $4,765 resistance, it would signal a new upward leg. Ultimately, the analyst advises exercising patience and waiting for the market to present a clear, healthy trade setup.

51695321,https://timestabloid.com/?p=83134,1757829741,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/67/default.png,Here’s What Is Revealed for the First about XRP and Global Banking,https://timestabloid.com/heres-what-is-revealed-for-the-first-about-xrp-and-global-banking/,"Crypto researcher SMQKE has released a detailed presentation outlining what he describes as verifiable proof that XRP is already integrated into the global banking infrastructure. In a tweet, SMQKE emphasized that the evidence presented is not speculative, but fully documented, demonstrating how XRP, through Ripple’s Interledger Protocol (ILP) and ISO 20022 compliance , is embedded in systems that move trillions of dollars daily. A video accompanying the tweet featured both SMQKE and Jesse as they walked through the evidence step by step. XRP’S INTEGRATION INTO THE REGULATED BANKING ECOSYSTEM—POWERED BY ISO 20022 AND RIPPLE’S INTERLEDGER PROTOCOL—REVEALED FOR THE FIRST TIME Not clickbait. This video presents verifiable evidence that XRP is already embedded in the global banking infrastructure that moves… pic.twitter.com/oihhycP0Qj — SMQKE (@SMQKEDQG) September 12, 2025 Evidence of XRP’s Integration In the video, Jesse introduced SMQKE as the lead presenter, highlighting that the research provided the strongest confirmation yet of XRP’s role in the banking system. SMQKE explained that by the end of the session, viewers would have a clear understanding of XRP’s place within regulated finance. He stated that his findings were presented directly from source documents to eliminate speculation. According to the presentation, Ripple’s Interledger Protocol functions as the foundation of this integration. First proposed in 2012, ILP enables interoperability between blockchains and traditional financial ledgers. SMQKE described ILP as essential for banks because it provides transaction scalability, privacy, and interoperability at levels required for institutions that process trillions of dollars per day. He further noted that ILP enables RippleNet, Ripple’s payment network, to operate at scale, with XRP used as the liquidity mechanism. Role of ISO 20022 in Banking Standards The researcher linked Ripple’s ILP with ISO 20022, the international standard for financial messaging that is replacing the older SWIFT system. He explained that ISO 20022 provides a universal language for financial institutions, allowing seamless communication and settlement. According to his findings, XRP is among a small group of ISO 20022-compliant digital assets, making it positioned for integration into global payment systems. SMQKE cited documents from Standard Chartered Bank, which explicitly list XRP as a native ISO 20022 token. The presentation also highlighted that RippleNet and XRP provide banks with faster and cheaper cross-border settlement compared to traditional methods. This compliance with ISO 20022 ensures that banks adopting the new messaging standard can easily connect with Ripple’s infrastructure and leverage XRP for liquidity advantages. International Finance Bank A significant portion of SMQKE’s evidence came from the International Finance Bank (IFB). He demonstrated that IFB has adopted Ripple’s Interledger Protocol as a cornerstone of its cross-ledger strategy. Documents from the bank confirmed that ILP and RippleNet are part of its payment infrastructure, with specific references to XRP liquidity being used when it offers foreign exchange advantages.

SMQKE pointed to IFB’s roadmap, which already lists RippleNet and XRP as operational options for payment pathways. SMQKE stressed that Ripple has already established extensive coverage across the financial sector, with RippleNet reportedly covering 90 percent of the global foreign exchange market and partnerships with over 100 banks. This widespread adoption, he argued, positions XRP to serve as a bridge asset once its market capitalization and liquidity reach sufficient levels. He concluded by stating that XRP integration into ISO 20022-compliant pipelines is a long-term strategy to address liquidity challenges in the banking system. Once XRP’s market cap is high enough, banks could rely on it as an on-demand liquidity solution for cross-border payments. SMQKE maintained that this evidence shows a direct pathway for XRP’s usage within the global financial system, fully aligned with regulatory standards and supported by established banking institutions.

The price of DOGE now sits close to $0.296, up from $0.21 earlier this month, as traders point to strong technical and onchain signals suggesting further growth. Bullish Technical Breakout On the weekly chart, Dogecoin has broken out of a multimonth symmetrical triangle, a continuation pattern that typically signals further upside. Trading volumes surged during the breakout, more than tripling compared to average levels, indicating strong momentum behind the move. Chart projections suggest Dogecoin could rise as high as $0.60, a gain of about 95% from current levels, by October. Some analysts, including CryptoKing and CryptoGoos, have issued more conservative targets near $0.45, which aligns with resistance from a broader multiyear triangle. Key Support Levels to Watch Dogecoin’s relative strength index (RSI) remains below the overbought threshold of 70, giving bulls further room to push higher. Still, traders warn that DOGE must hold above its 50-week exponential moving average, currently near $0.227, to sustain the bullish setup. A decisive drop below this level could trigger a deeper correction toward the 200-week EMA around $0.215. Signs of More Growth Potential Beyond technical patterns, onchain indicators point to additional upside. Dogecoin’s MVRV Z-Score, which measures whether an asset is over- or undervalued compared to historical holder costs, currently sits at 1.35. In past cycles, similar readings have preceded major rallies, including last November’s 230% surge. By contrast, extreme highs — such as the Z-Score exceeding 20 during DOGE’s all-time peak near $0.70 in 2021 — signaled overheated conditions. The modest current reading suggests that investors are not sitting on excessive unrealized profits, leaving more room for price appreciation. Can Dogecoin Repeat Historic Rallies? With momentum building, comparisons are being made to past explosive moves, particularly last year’s triple-digit surge. Analysts say the current setup leaves open the possibility of another significant rally if key supports hold and broader crypto sentiment remains positive. While risks remain — including sudden market corrections and broader macroeconomic factors — Dogecoin’s breakout has strengthened the case for further gains in the coming weeks.",Crypto News Today|Crypto Intelligence,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|DOGE|TRADING|MARKET|BUSINESS,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2025-09-14 06:15:37

Ripple CEO Just Went Nuclear,https://timestabloid.com/xrps-943-scenario-ripple-ceo-just-went-nuclear/,"Crypto enthusiast Diana shared a tweet highlighting a projection attributed to Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse. In the tweet, Garlinghouse is said to have outlined that XRP could capture 14 percent of SWIFT’s annual flows within the next five years. SWIFT, according to the tweet, facilitates around $1.5 quadrillion in transactions annually, and 14 percent of that figure would amount to approximately $210 trillion. The tweet reveals the magnitude of the number by placing it against the United States’ gross domestic product, which stands at $27 trillion. The post says the outcome would mark a fundamental change in global money movement. XRP’S $943 SCENARIO? BRAD GARLINGHOUSE JUST WENT NUCLEAR Ripple’s CEO dropped one of the boldest projections we’ve ever heard: XRP could capture 14% of SWIFT’s $1.5 quadrillion flows within 5 years. If true, this isn’t just bullish. It’s historic. Let’s unpack pic.twitter.com/h9nGntK9Ng — Diana (@InvestWithD) September 12, 2025 Liquidity demands and valuation scenarios The tweet explained that if even a fraction of these projected flows were directed into XRP liquidity pools, the resulting demand would transform the way price discovery occurs for the asset. Rather than being driven by speculative retail cycles, the post suggested that institutional flows could produce valuations far beyond previous peaks. Diana’s tweet introduced various scenarios to illustrate this. A conservative approach, assuming only 1 percent of global flows, was paired with a calculation that suggested a value of around $96 per XRP. Another more aggressive scenario, using an assumed effective float of 5.6 billion XRP, produced an estimate of $943 per token. The tweet presented these figures as outcomes of arithmetic rather than speculative hype, pointing to the scale of the capital involved. Market infrastructure and adoption drivers Diana’s post also pointed to areas beyond SWIFT where XRP’s potential utility is being considered. The tweet mentioned the Depository Trust & Clearing Corporation, which handles settlements valued at approximately $3 quadrillion, global banking deposits across the United States and Japan worth $37.5 trillion, and annual payments processed by Visa, Mastercard, and American Express totalling $26 trillion. The tweet further noted that tokenization is a growing sector expected to represent trillions in value over the coming decade. By highlighting these institutions and markets, the tweet suggested that XRP is positioned as a settlement layer extending into multiple financial systems, beyond traditional cross-border payments. Timelines and institutional context According to the tweet, Garlinghouse’s statement that XRP could achieve this level of integration within five years should not be viewed as an offhand remark. Instead, the post suggested it reflects Ripple’s outlook on accelerating adoption timelines. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 It linked this to trends such as the tokenization of real-world assets, the growth of stablecoins, the creation of exchange-traded funds, and the development of central bank digital currencies. In this framing, XRP was described not simply as a payments solution but as infrastructure for broader institutional settlement. The tweet concluded with an emphasis on what these figures could mean for XRP holders. Even marginal market penetration was presented as potentially significant, with examples showing that a 0.1% share of global flows could imply a valuation of around $9.6 per token A 1 percent share would translate to approximately $96, while the projected 14 percent capture of SWIFT flows would imply a scenario in the hundreds of dollars per token. Diana noted that the issue is not one of speculative hype but rather of whether regulatory frameworks, banking systems, and financial networks align quickly enough to enable such levels of adoption.

The market is completely underestimating the likelihood of such an announcement,” Thorn said. The US recently made a statement about establishing a reserve but announced that it would not actively purchase BTC. Although some industry executives are more cautious about the possibility, there are signs that the plan is moving forward. US President Donald Trump signed an executive order in March formalizing the establishment of the Strategic Bitcoin Reserve and the US Digital Asset Reserve. However, the strategic plan for implementing the reserve has not yet been finalized. Related News: Morgan Stanley and Deutsche Bank Predict How Much the Fed Will Cut Interest Rates Recent developments suggest the process is ongoing. On Tuesday, US lawmakers introduced a bill to the Treasury Department that would require the preparation of a report on the feasibility and technical requirements of a strategic Bitcoin reserve.

The chart presents a falling wedge pattern that began forming in late July. This type of pattern often signals a period of consolidation followed by a potential breakout when price action moves beyond the upper trendline. In this instance, the price of XRP appears to have broken above the descending resistance line in early September, creating interest around the first potential upside target displayed on the chart. #XRP short-term price target pic.twitter.com/69cYea3Wgi — STEPH IS CRYPTO (@Steph_iscrypto) September 13, 2025 The Falling Wedge Pattern XRP’s price action displayed strong upward momentum, reaching an all-time high of $3.65 in July before entering the consolidation phase visible on the chart. This phase reached its lowest point in early September when the asset fell to $2.71. This move marked the deepest retest of the wedge’s lower boundary. However, XRP’s trajectory shifted shortly after, with a swift climb to regain the $3 support level . This surge pushed XRP out of the falling wedge, breaking above the descending upper line, which typically signals that buyers are gaining control, especially when accompanied by increased volume or sustained higher lows. XRP’s Next Target The analyst’s chart identifies $3.6389 as the first level, which sits about 16.85% above the current price. This figure is explicitly marked on the chart with an upward green arrow, indicating where the price could advance if the breakout continues. This would place the digital asset just below its all-time high, with a chance that the breakout could continue and push XRP into a price discovery phase . We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 What This Means for Market Participants For traders who follow technical analysis, a breakout from a falling wedge can indicate an early stage of a bullish trend reversal or continuation. The 4-hour chart shows how price compression within the wedge pattern created a buildup that now appears to be resolving upward. If XRP maintains its breakout trajectory, the price level of $3.6389 becomes a logical first checkpoint. The chart does not provide further targets beyond the $3.6389 mark. However, in technical analysis, once a resistance level is broken, market participants often watch for continuation patterns or new consolidation zones to form. Meanwhile, XRP’s tendency to move quickly could help it reach new levels sooner than expected. Disclaimer : This content is meant to inform and should not be considered financial advice.

We Asked 3 AI Models,https://cryptopotato.com/can-ripples-xrp-smash-through-5-in-2025-we-asked-3-ai-models/,"TL;DR Three of the most popular AI solutions share their take on whether Ripple’s native token has the legs for another mind-blowing rally this year that will take it above $5. Here are their answers, and some of them might be quite surprising. 2024/2025 Quick Recap 2025 will go down in history as one of the most eventful years in the relatively short period of cryptocurrency existence. Ripple’s native token is no exception, as it should receive a prime spot in that ranking (after all, it has become the third-largest digital asset by market cap). The asset did what many thought was impossible just a year ago. It skyrocketed from under $0.6 this time last year to a new all-time high of $3.65 marked in July 2025. As such, it finally broke its previous record, which was set in January 2018. Yet, it lost some traction in the following couple of months and has just recently reclaimed the coveted $3 resistance (which acts as support once again). So, the question is whether it has given its all this year, or it still has some fuel in the tank for another rally, this time to and beyond $5. Let’s examine what ChatGPT, Gemini, and Grok had to say about this. The Bull Case OpenAI’s solution started with its bullish case, which envisions a price pump to the aforementioned target and even slightly above it, should the asset reclaim the $3.40 – $3.50 resistance. That’s from a technical standpoint. News propellers that could send XRP flying would be the potential approval of spot Ripple ETFs in the US. Although the regulator responsible for approving or denying these filings continues to delay making a decision, the overall odds, according to experts and Polymarket, are above 90% for this year. If greenlighted, the XRP ETFs can help legitimize the underlying token and enhance its institutional adoption, said ChatGPT. Grok listed the following factors that could help XRP achieve the $5 goal, some of which were identical to the ones from its OpenAI rival: p]:pt-0 [&>p]:mb-2 [&>p]:my-0""> Regulatory clarity, especially regarding SEC-ETF decisions, could be a catalyst. p]:pt-0 [&>p]:mb-2 [&>p]:my-0""> Ripple’s continued expansion in cross-border payments and banking partnerships. p]:pt-0 [&>p]:mb-2 [&>p]:my-0""> Institutional investment inflows and potential ETF approvals. p]:pt-0 [&>p]:mb-2 [&>p]:my-0""> Technical signals like breaking resistance levels around $3.09 to $3.60. p]:pt-0 [&>p]:mb-2 [&>p]:my-0""> Introduction of other products like Ripple’s RLUSD stablecoin. Gemini was a bit more conservative, indicating that such a 65% surge to $5 in the next three and a half months would require a combination of factors, including significant fresh capital and several positive catalysts to occur. Not-So-Bullish Case ChatGPT warned that XRP might have given everything it had in 2025 and listed potential drawbacks that could hinder its growth potential. Weak On-Chain Metrics: XRP Ledger’s DeFi activity remains muted, with TVL under $100 million and trading volumes sharply down since mid-summer. Exchange Reserves Rising: Binance’s XRP holdings recently hit a record, signaling possible sell pressure if markets turn risk-off. Macro Environment: If global liquidity tightens or Bitcoin consolidates, XRP could stay range-bound between $2.70 and $3.20 for the rest of 2025. Gemini added that longer periods of correction and consolidation are rather natural after such explosive rallies, like the one XRP experienced from November 2024 to July 2025 (with small deviations). “XRP’s smashing through $5 in 2025 is seen as an achievable but optimistic scenario by several experts, with the more conservative outlooks pointing to prices below $4 for most of the year,” concluded Grok.

The recent negative tone of the economic data points from last week raised expectations that the Federal Reserve will cut interest rates on Wednesday, making riskier assets such as stocks and bitcoin more attractive. Let's recap the data that backs up that thesis. The most important one, the U.S. CPI figures , came out on Thursday. The headline rate was slightly higher than expected, a sign inflation might be stickier than anticipated. Before that, we had Tuesday's revisions to job data. The world's largest economy created almost 1 million fewer jobs than reported in the year ended March, the largest downward revision in the country's history. The figures followed the much-watched monthly jobs report, which was released the previous Friday. The U.S. added just 22,000 jobs in August, with unemployment rising to 4.3%, the Bureau of Labor Statistics said. Initial jobless claims rose 27,000 to 263,000 — the highest since October 2021. Higher inflation and fewer jobs are not great for the U.S. economy, so it's no surprise that the word ""stagflation"" is starting to creep back into macroeconomic commentary. Against this backdrop, bitcoin—considered a risk asset by Wall Street—continued grinding higher, topping $116,000 on Friday and almost closing the CME futures gap at 117,300 from August. Not a surprise, as traders are also bidding up the biggest risk assets: equities. Just take a look at the S&P 500 index, which closed at a record for the second day on the hope of a rate cut. So how should traders think about BTC's price chart? To this chart enthusiast, price action remains constructive, with higher lows forming from the September bottom of $107,500. The 200-day moving average has climbed to $102,083, while the Short-Term Holder Realized Price — often used as support in bull markets — rose to a record $109,668. Bitcoin-linked stocks: A mixed bag However, bitcoin's weekly positive price action didn't help Strategy (MSTR), the largest of the bitcoin treasury companies, whose shares were about flat for the week. Its rivals performed better: MARA Holdings (MARA) 7% and XXI (CEP) 4%. Strategy (MSTR) has underperformed bitcoin year-to-date and continues to hover below its 200-day moving average, currently $355. At Thursday's close of $326, it's testing a key long-term support level seen back in September 2024 and April 2025. The company’s mNAV premium has compressed to below 1.5x when accounting for outstanding convertible debt and preferred stock, or roughly 1.3x based solely on equity value. Preferred stock issuance remains muted, with only $17 million tapped across STRK and STRF this week, meaning that the bulk of at-the-money issuance is still flowing through common shares . According to the company , options are now listed and trading for all four perpetual preferred stocks, a development that could provide additional yield on the dividend. Bullish catalysts for crypto stocks? The CME's FedWatch tool shows traders expect a 25 basis-point U.S. interest-rate cut in September and have priced in a total of three rate cuts by year-end. That's a sign risk sentiment could tilt back toward growth and crypto-linked equities, underlined by the 10-year U.S. Treasury briefly breaking below 4% this week. Still, the dollar index (DXY) continues to hold multiyear support, a potential inflection point worth watching.",Markets|Bitcoin|Inflation|News,EN,0,0,MACROECONOMICS|CRYPTOCURRENCY|TRADING|BTC|MARKET,"{'name': 'CoinDesk', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/5/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coindesk,2025-09-14 08:00:00

Now, the storm has settled, and capital is flowing back into crypto investment products. The Bitcoin ETFs seem to be back enjoying the attention of US investors in the month of September, as seen with some significant performances over the past two weeks. The past week was particularly impressive, as the Bitcoin funds recorded no single outflow day. Bitcoin ETFs Close Week With $642-M Inflow According to the latest market data , the US-based Bitcoin ETFs posted a total net inflow of $642.35 million on Friday, September 12. This single-day performance marked the fifth consecutive day of positive capital influx for the exchange-traded funds. Surprisingly, Fidelity Wise Origin Bitcoin Fund (with the ticker FBTC) led the pack on Friday, closing the week with a net inflow of over $315 million. Meanwhile, BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (with the ticker IBIT) came in second with a daily net inflow of $264.71 million on Friday. This impressive daily performance pushed the largest Bitcoin exchange-traded fund closer to reaching a net assets valuation of $90 billion. Bitwise Bitcoin ETF (BITB) with a $29.16 million net inflow and ARK 21Shares Bitcoin ETF (ARKB) with a $19.37 million net inflow also added value in double digits on Friday. Grayscale Bitcoin Mini Trust (BTC) and VanEck Bitcoin ETF (HODL) were the only Bitcoin ETFs that recorded any activity, with $5.69 million and $8.24 million, respectively, on the day. As inferred earlier, Friday’s $642-million performance was only the latest in a line of strong performances by the US-based Bitcoin ETFs. The latest market data shows that the BTC exchange-traded funds added $2.34 billion in value over the past week. This past week’s performance represents the first time that the Bitcoin ETFs would be crossing the billion-dollar mark on the inflow chart. Also, the BTC-linked investment products outperformed the US Ethereum ETF market, which closed the week with a net weekly inflow of $637.69. Bitcoin Price At A Glance This positive performance of the spot Bitcoin ETFs is a reflection of the resurgence that the BTC price went through over the past week. According to data from CoinGecko, the premier cryptocurrency is up by more than 5%. As of this writing, Bitcoin is valued at around $115,990, with no substantial price change in the past 24 hours.",ETF|bitcoin|bitcoin news|bitcoin price|btc|BTCUSDT|Ethereum ETFs|Spot Bitcoin ETFs,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|TRADING,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-09-14 08:00:07

This choppy price action has raised doubts about the flagship cryptocurrency’s potential to resume its bull run and reach a new all-time high price. A crypto expert on social media platform X has come forward with an interesting outlook for the Bitcoin price, stating that the market leader could be gearing up for its next explosive move. However, the on-chain analyst added that a certain condition must be met for BTC to resume its uptrend. A Break Above $118,000 Could Precede Price Explosion: Analyst In a September 13 post on X, Alphractal founder and CEO Joao Wedson revealed that the price of Bitcoin could be preparing for an extended rally over the next few weeks. The on-chain data expert shared that the premier cryptocurrency will need a convincing break above the $118,000 level to confirm the resumption of the bull run. Related Reading: Analyst Sets Bold $1,314 Target For Solana After Cup-And-Handle Breakout Wedson noted in his post that $117,000 is actually the price mark to watch out for, as it represents a zone of strong interest and indecision. Specifically, two on-chain indicators—the CVDD Channel and the Fibonacci-Adjusted Market Mean Price—have designated this price level as a point where the market is likely to slow down or form a local top. According to analytics platform Alphractal, the CVDD Channel is a metric that estimates historical price floors and risk zones based on the coin destruction data and Fibonacci envelopes. Meanwhile, the Fibonacci-Adjusted Market Mean Price combines the market mean price with Fibonacci bands to identify structural expansion and value zones. Wedson highlighted that both the CVDD Channel and the Fibonacci-Adjusted Market Mean Price have revealed “eerily accurate levels” of support and resistance throughout Bitcoin’s price history. Currently, these metrics are pointing to $117,000 as a level that could provide resistance to the upward movement of the Bitcoin price. In the end, Wedson concluded that this zone could be critical to the market leader’s next move to the upside. However, the Alphractal founder advised Bitcoin investors to wait for a clear, sustained breakout above $118,000 to confirm that bullish momentum is back. Bitcoin Price At A Glance As of this writing, the price of BTC stands at around $115,905, reflecting no significant change in the past 24 hours.

In a recent post, CW wrote, “Remember that the real rally for $XRP comes after the ATH breakout. It’s getting closer.” The statement underscores the view that the asset’s strongest phase of upward momentum would only begin once historical resistance levels are broken. Remember that the real rally for $XRP comes after the ATH breakout. It's getting closer. https://t.co/8zO727jGEl pic.twitter.com/Xff4uXprmD — CW (@CW8900) September 13, 2025 Chart Analysis and Market Phases Alongside CW’s remarks, a chart was shared showing XRP’s price history segmented into distinct phases. The chart presents a comparison between past and current market cycles, highlighting repeating patterns over time. According to the illustration, XRP has historically moved through phases of accumulation, consolidation, and breakout before reaching new highs. The chart outlines four primary phases. The initial stage is followed by a corrective phase where the price consolidates within a downward structure. This is then succeeded by a sideways trading phase, which transitions into a breakout phase marked by accelerated price movement. Within the current structure, the chart places XRP in a stage preceding a major breakout, with emphasis on the potential for gains once the all-time high level is surpassed. The image also identifies two potential target levels. The first is the prior all-time high, which would serve as an initial breakout confirmation. The second, marked as TP2, is projected using the Fibonacci extension level of 6.618, suggesting a possible target in the region of $21.5. The comparison to earlier cycles, particularly the 2017 breakout, is used to illustrate how similar technical structures previously led to significant increases in price. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Current Market Conditions At the time of the chart’s capture, XRP was trading above $3, showing an increase of more than 10 percent within the session. The visual also highlights volume activity, which historically accompanied breakout movements in past cycles. Observers within the XRP community have noted that price consolidation within structured patterns has often preceded larger directional moves, and CW’s commentary reinforces this interpretation by emphasizing the role of the all-time high as a pivotal level. CW’s analysis and the accompanying chart reiterate the perspective that XRP’s market trajectory remains dependent on surpassing its historical peak. The outlined phases and technical targets provide a structured interpretation of how previous cycles unfolded, with implications that similar dynamics could apply again. While near-term volatility remains a factor, the emphasis on the all-time high breakout positions it as a critical milestone for the asset’s next major rally .

Once known for its vast fleets of bitcoin mining rigs, the company is now part of a growing trend: converting energy-intensive mining operations into high-performance AI facilities. Bitcoin miners like Core, Hut 8 (HUT) and TeraWulf (WULF) are swapping ASIC machines — the dedicated bitcoin mining computer — for GPU clusters, driven by the lure of AI’s explosive growth and the harsh economics of crypto mining. Power play It's no secret that bitcoin mining requires an extensive amount of energy, which is the biggest cost of minting a new digital asset. Back in the 2021 bull run, when the Bitcoin network's hashrate and difficulty were low, miners were making out like bandits with margins as much as 90%. Then came the brutal crypto winter and the halving event, which slashed the mining reward in half. In 2025, with surging hashrate and energy prices, miners are now struggling to survive with razor-thin margins. However, the need for power—the biggest input cost—became a blessing in disguise for these miners, who needed a different strategy to diversify their revenue sources. Due to rising competition for mining, the miners continued to procure more machines to stay afloat, and with it came the need for more megawatts of electricity at a cheaper price. Miners invested heavily in securing these low-cost energy sources, such as hydroelectric or stranded natural gas sites, and developed expertise in managing high-density cooling and electrical systems—skills honed during the crypto boom of the early 2020s. This is what captured the attention of AI and cloud computing firms. While bitcoin relies on specialized ASICs, AI thrives on versatile GPUs like Nvidia's H100 series, which require similar high-power environments but for parallel processing tasks in machine learning. Instead of building out data centers from scratch, taking over mining infrastructure, which already has power ready, became a faster way to grow an increasing appetite for AI-related infrastructure. Essentially, these miners aren’t just pivoting—they’re retrofitting. The cooling systems, low-cost energy contracts, and power-dense infrastructure they built during the crypto boom now serve a new purpose: feeding the AI models of companies like OpenAI and Google. Firms like Crusoe Energy sold off mining assets to focus solely on AI, deploying GPU clusters in remote, energy-rich locations that mirror the decentralized ethos of crypto but now fuel centralized AI hyperscalers. Terraforming AI Bitcoin mining has effectively ""terraformed"" the terrain for AI compute by building out scalable, power-efficient infrastructure that AI desperately needs. As Nicholas Gregory, Board Director at Fragrant Prosperity, noted, ""It can be argued bitcoin paved the way for digital dollar payments as can be seen with USDT/Tether. It also looks like bitcoin terraformed data centres for AI/GPU compute."" This pre-existing ""terraforming"" allows miners to retrofit facilities quickly, often in under a year, compared to the multi-year timelines for traditional data center builds. Firms like Crusoe Energy sold off mining assets to focus solely on AI, deploying GPU clusters in remote, energy-rich locations that mirror the decentralized ethos of crypto but now fuel centralized AI hyperscalers. Higher returns In practice, it means miners can flip a facility in less than a year—far faster than the multi-year timeline of a new data center. But AI isn’t a cheap upgrade. Bitcoin mining setups are relatively modest, with costs ranging from $300,000 to $800,000 per megawatt (MW) excluding ASICs, allowing for quick scalability in response to market cycles. Meanwhile, AI infrastructure demands significantly higher capex due to the need for advanced liquid cooling, redundant power systems, and the GPUs themselves, which can cost tens of thousands per unit and face global supply shortages. Despite the steeper upfront costs, AI offers miners up to 25 times more revenue per kilowatt-hour than bitcoin mining, making the pivot economically compelling amid rising energy prices and declining crypto profitability. A niche industry worth billions As AI continues to surge and crypto profits tighten, bitcoin mining could become a niche game—one reserved for energy-rich regions or highly efficient players, especially as the next in 2028 could render many operations unprofitable without breakthroughs in efficiency or energy costs. While projections show the global crypto mining market growing to $3.3 billion by 2030, at a modest 6.9% CAGR, the billions would be overshadowed by AI's exponential expansion. According to KBV Research , the global AI in mining market is projected to reach $435.94 billion by 2032, expanding at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 40.6%. With investors already seeing dollar signs in this shift, the broader trend suggests the future is either a hybrid or a full conversion to AI, where stable contracts with hyperscalers promise longevity over crypto's boom-bust cycles.

Details",https://timestabloid.com/market-strategist-says-xrp-to-1000-is-inevitable-but-when-details/,"XRP has recently faced selling pressure after rallying to its yearly high of $3.66. The asset has since corrected to the $3.00 range in line with broader market weakness. While short-term conditions appear uncertain, some analysts continue to highlight the cryptocurrency’s long-term potential. Armando Pantoja, a well-known crypto investor and commentator, recently reaffirmed his view that XRP could eventually reach $1,000 . According to him, the target is realistic over a long period, although unlikely to materialize in the immediate future. His remarks came as a counterpoint to more aggressive projections in the market. $XRP will eventually hit $1,000 but not tomorrow and not soon. $BTC took 8 years to sustain above $1,000. The lawsuit held #XRP down, it's like we are starting from scratch. But hey, I'll wait 10+ years for a 33,233% return. Repost if you agree — Armando Pantoja (@_TallGuyTycoon) July 25, 2025 For example, Jake Claver of Digital Ascension Group has suggested XRP could rise to between $1,500 and $2,000 by early 2026. Pantoja disagrees with this timeframe, stating that XRP will require significantly more time to achieve even the $1,000 threshold. Comparing XRP’s Path to Bitcoin’s Growth To support his stance, Pantoja pointed to Bitcoin’s historical trajectory. Bitcoin first crossed $1,000 in November 2013, approximately four years after its launch. However, it failed to sustain this milestone and required another three years to establish itself above the level in 2017. Altogether, it took eight years from inception for Bitcoin to hold that price region decisively. Drawing from this history, Pantoja argued that XRP could experience a similar pattern. Yet, he acknowledged that the comparison highlights certain challenges. Unlike Bitcoin, the first and largest cryptocurrency, XRP has already been in existence for 13 years without reaching a comparable valuation. Impact of Legal Proceedings Pantoja attributed part of XRP’s delayed performance to the regulatory uncertainty surrounding its ongoing legal dispute with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. The case, which began in December 2020, disrupted investor confidence and delayed adoption. With the matter now nearing resolution, Pantoja believes the project may be able to restart its trajectory under more favourable conditions. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 He suggested that once legal risks are behind it, XRP could follow a growth path similar to what Bitcoin achieved in its first decade. Based on this reasoning, Pantoja estimated that XRP might take around eight additional years to reach the $1,000 mark , setting a tentative timeframe between 2033 and 2035. Long-Term Returns for Patient Investors At the current market price of about $3.10, XRP would need to appreciate roughly 3,100% to reach $1,000. While such a gain appears extraordinary, Pantoja emphasized that long-term investors willing to wait could still find the prospect attractive. In his view, a potential return of more than 30,000% over the course of a decade justifies optimism, provided investors understand the risks and extended timeline involved. Although XRP’s immediate outlook reflects volatility and legal uncertainty, analysts like Armando Pantoja maintain that its long-term prospects remain strong. He expects eventual growth toward $1,000, but not within the rapid timelines suggested by some market commentators. Instead, his analysis underscores the importance of patience, suggesting that XRP’s climb to four-digit territory may not occur until the mid-2030s.

In his statement, Yongli argued that stablecoins are neither indispensable nor substitutable for the functioning of the on-chain crypto world. According to Yongli, stablecoin regulations will inevitably trigger regulation of the entire crypto asset class, which could have profound market impacts. However, they also carry the risk of negative consequences for stablecoins. Related News: Morgan Stanley and Deutsche Bank Predict How Much the Fed Will Cut Interest Rates Yongli argued that China should be more deliberate and proactive in this process, saying the country's focus should not be on developing a RMB-based stablecoin. Instead, he argued that all cryptoasset laws should be swiftly implemented, banks and other financial institutions should be encouraged to transition to blockchain, the development of real-world assets (RWA) should be actively supported, and cryptocurrency exchanges should be registered in Hong Kong to accelerate the on-chain operation of the RMB. *This is not investment advice.

This could push XRP into a new phase of institutional demand just as PayFi altcoins, Remittix (RTX) included, are gearing up for big moves. As XRP eyes regulatory clarity and potential ETF status, Remittix is delivering utility, rewards, and real momentum. Ripple (XRP) Poised For ETF Surge Ripple’s legal battle with the SEC officially ended recently, removing a key obstacle to ETF filings. With that clarity, several analysts believe BlackRock could submit for a spot XRP ETF in early 2026. Currently, XRP trades at $3.16, facing resistance near $3.40, a crucial technical level. Meanwhile, sentiment is rising, prediction markets and ETF experts are placing approval odds above 80% to 90 % for spot XRP ETFs. Remittix (RTX) Showing Strong PayFi Altcoin Momentum Remittix’s comparison to XRP now matters, while XRP is a top-established token benefiting from legal certainty and ETF speculation, Remittix is still at an earlier stage, but moving fast in the PayFi space. Remittix matches growing interest in real utility beyond speculation, and may offer a sharper growth curve if it scales quickly relative to XRP’s continuing structural developments. The numbers speak loudly. Remittix has sold over 661 million tokens, is presently priced at $0.108, and has raised over $25.5 million. These metrics give RTX a strong foundation in fundraising and market validation. Remittix has already secured its first centralized exchange listing on BitMart after crossing $20 million in funding, followed by LBANK after passing $22 million, and is preparing a third. Here are some of what give Remittix a real edge: Mass market appeal beyond crypto insiders The wallet beta launches in Q3 2025 Users can send crypto to bank accounts in over 30 countries The project is audited by CertiK, which builds trust and transparency Built for adoption, not speculation Remittix is not just riding the hype; it is delivering features and infrastructure. While XRP may benefit from ETF inflows and regulatory clearing, Remittix is also delivering real product and reward mechanics now, making it a standout among PayFi altcoins. What This Means For XRP And PayFi Altcoins BlackRock filing for a spot XRP ETF in early 2026 looks more than speculative; it may become a reality now that regulatory issues are largely resolved. XRP stands to gain from broad institutional exposure, while Remittix is set to surge as it offers a growing ecosystem, wallet beta launch on September 15, a 15% USDT referral program you can claim daily, and a $250,000 giveaway that motivates its community. These twin tracks, XRP’s ETF potential and Remittix’s utility and incentives, suggest that PayFi altcoins are not just waiting in the wings; they are stepping into the spotlight.

According to the platform, it negotiated with the attacker, securing the return of 185 ETH through an Ethereum transaction. In an earlier alert, the platform told its users and the general public on blogging platform X about the potential exploit that may be affecting users connected to Kame. As a precaution, it urged users who still had funds connected to Kame to revoke approval immediately till the issue was sorted. “We sincerely apologize for the inconvenience and are working closely with the team to identify and resolve the issue as quickly as possible. We will share updates as soon as we have more information,” the decentralized aggregator said. Kame aggregator recovers part of its stolen funds Later in the day, it released a follow-up report urging its users to revoke token approvals to two of its contracts, noting that the investigation was still ongoing. While investigations were still ongoing, Kame aggregator said it was important that users carry out the instructions, with the platform dropping a list of steps that they could undertake to revoke the approval. “This step is critical to ensure the safety of your assets. We will provide further updates as soon as possible,” it said. In an updated post by one of the developers, the post stated it has placed multiple bounties to track the exploiter and, coordinated with partners to get their support. The developer said they were also in contact with the hacker via DM on Blockscan, negotiating to have a portion of the stolen funds returned, while still working on further negotiations. “Our current priority remains to mitigate damage, recover funds, and strengthen security moving forward,” the developer said. Critical Update! We have successfully communicated with hackers and they accepted our offer to transfer funds back. 185 ETH has been refunded by this transation https://t.co/SFWD6JJV7K We are collecting information about affected hackers and will soon inform the compensate plan.… — Kame Aggregator (@kame_agg) September 13, 2025 After direct communications with the attacker, Kame acknowledged that about 185 ETH had been transferred by the attacker into a recovery wallet. The exact size of the exploit is yet to be determined, but the platform has promised a full review into the issue in order to determine the total losses. The team also mentioned that it is looking into compensation packages for users impacted by the breach. Promise of compensation amid rise in hacks in 2025 The framework is expected to be published after the investigators are done auditing the wallet data. Until then, users have been advised to disable token approvals following the laid-down steps and wait for updates concerning security protocols. In addition, the team also noted that the recovery was achieved in a collaborative effort with partners from the Sei community. The recovery came at a time when Ethereum posted a slight 5% gain despite registering a decline for the month. Since the beginning of the year, there has been a major uptick in hacks and criminal thefts in the crypto market. As previously reported by Cryptopolitan, the latest analysis from blockchain security firm PeckShield showed that crypto hacks and exploits went up by 15% from July. The security report showed that more than $163 million was stolen across 16 different incidents. The report noted the incidents of Btc Turk, ODIN.fun, BetterBank, and CrediX Finance are the highlights of the month. On August 14, cybersecurity firm Cyvers noted unusual activities involving Ethereum and other tokens on different blockchains. The Cyvers systems flagged large transactions on Ethereum, Arbitrum, Base, Optimism, Polygon, Avalanche, and Mantle. “Our system detected multiple alerts across ETH, AVAX, ARB, BASE, OP, MANTLE, and MATIC networks,” the company reported. About 20 minutes later, Btc Turk paused deposits and withdrawals, noting technical issues with its hot wallet. According to Cyvers, $48 million worth of Ethereum was stolen.

By 2031, BTC might touch $350,548 following increased institutional adoption. Since the beginning of 2024, Bitcoin’s price has doubled, but it has seen a notable 45% increase in just the two weeks following the presidential election. This boost has solidified Bitcoin’s role in the so-called “Trump trade,” with the president-elect’s positive stance on the cryptocurrency industry fueling investor optimism about this emerging asset class. As Bitcoin’s on-chain activities surge, questions arise, such as: “Does Bitcoin have the potential to hold above the $100K mark?” or “Will Bitcoin go up?” or “Where will Bitcoin be in 5 years?” Let’s answer them using our Bitcoin price prediction.

Is Bitcoin a good investment? The rising institutional demand for Bitcoin etfs makes it a good investment option in the crypto market. However, Bitcoin has a short investment history filled with very volatile market value. Whether it is a good investment depends on your financial profile, investment portfolio, risk tolerance, and investment goals. It is suggested to conduct investment advice of the financial markets and understand the financial system risks. Why is Bitcoin up today? Bitcoin faced a surge in buying demand as buyers pushed the price above Fib levels. The recent lows triggered strong accumulation. Will the BTC price reach $100K? Bitcoin price broke its much-anticipated mark of $100K, aiming for a new ATH. The price currently prepares to maintain its buying demand above $120K. Will BTC reach $1 million? $1 million is a significant milestone for the BTC price. However, it is achievable if Bitcoin continues to attract institutional interest in the coming years. Is Bitcoin a good long-term investment? As several institutions continue to accumulate BTC and Bitcoin faces a rise in global recognition, Bitcoin has a solid long-term future. Recent news/opinions on BTC As reported by Cryptopolitan, Metaplanet has purchased 136 Bitcoin worth around 2.251 billion yen as part of its continued Bitcoin Treasury strategy. https://twitter.com/Metaplanet_JP/status/1964887196458275049 Bitcoin price prediction September 2025 Bitcoin’s price jumped to $125,000, making August its best month in 2025. This rise is partly because, in the past, Bitcoin has often grown a lot after its “halving” events. Analysts think the current market is following the same pattern, which could mean we’ll see a peak around September 2025. Bitcoin’s price might attempt to maintain an average price of $111,000 and be pushed further, at least $118,000 if strong downward pressures are not seen. However, we might see a rejection on the bearish side, leading to a consolidation at around $105,000. Bitcoin Price Prediction Potential Low Potential Average Potential High Bitcoin Price Prediction September 2025 $105,000 $111,000 $118,000 Bitcoin price prediction 2025 Historically, Bitcoin has been a significant crypto coin in the year following a halving, and it is expected to push up its price. Bitcoin miners might play a crucial role in holding bullish sentiment for future price movements. Spot Bitcoin ETFs are projected to be a key driver of Bitcoin prices and the broader cryptocurrency market in 2025. As a result, Bitcoin’s trajectory might follow a bullish trend ahead with rising treasury term premium. Furthermore, there is an increasing bullish sentiment that the base interest rates could be cut in the US, and thus, help to further the upward movement of Bitcoin . An outcome of which the 2025 year could be positive for Bitcoin, with its crypto-price perhaps touching $160,000 at the highest and the low could be around $68,000.

However, more financial products including a surge in ETF flows might hold BTC prices within a bullish region. The digital assets market sentiment shows bullish signals for Bitcoin hit new highs. As the overall sentiment gives a bullish outlook, one should research more about Bitcoin before investing. We might see a maximum price of $185,000, with a minimum price of $115,000 and average price of $130,000. However, BitMEX CEO Arthur Hayes predicted the BTC price to touch $700K in 2026.

Cryptopolitan’s Bitcoin (BTC) Price Prediction A surge in bitcoin adoption and the expansion of the Bitcoin ecosystem might end the controversy of “Bitcoin bubble” in future. This might boost the Bitcoin cost and strengthen the Bitcoin network. At Cryptopolitan, we are bullish on Bitcoin’s future price as the historical market sentiment is extremely impressive. By the end of 2025, Bitcoin might record a maximum of $160,000, with a minimum price of $68,000 and an average price of $120,000. However, Bitcoin’s future market potential entirely depends on its buying demand, regulation, and investor sentiment regarding long-term holdings. Crypto analysts provide a positive sentiment as macroeconomic trends turn promising. We expect Bitcoin price to surpass a high of $216,000 by the end of 2027. Bitcoin historic price sentiment BTC price history: Coinmarketcap Satoshi Nakamoto created Bitcoin in 2009, marking the first use of blockchain technology. Bitcoin was initially of little value, gaining significant traction and hitting over $15,000 during the 2017 boom, with further highs reached in 2019 and 2021. In 2021, Bitcoin peaked at $68,789.63 but dropped to $15,760 by December 2022 amid economic pressures, including inflation and geopolitical conflicts. By April 10, 2023, Bitcoin’s price surged 83%, breaking the $30,000 resistance level. Throughout mid-2023, Bitcoin’s value hovered around $30,000, nearly reaching $32,000 due to positive market sentiments and potential ETF approvals. Bitcoin experienced a significant price drop in mid-August 2023, falling to $25,000. However, its prices remained volatile, fluctuating between $26,000 and $29,500 in October. Bitcoin closed 2023 above $42,000, a 155% increase from the year’s start. In early 2024, Bitcoin rose above $45,000 on ETF anticipation but briefly dipped below $40,000 after approvals. It broke its 2021 all-time high in March, reaching $73,750.07 on March 14, before dropping below $60,000 in April. May saw another surge above $70,000, while June and July brought heavy fluctuations between $70K and $55K. Bitcoin rallied to $66K in September after a Fed rate cut, climbed to $70K in October’s Uptober rally, and surged toward $108K following Donald Trump’s victory in the November US elections. BTC ended 2024 consolidating below $95K. At the start of January 2025, BTC was trading between $92,788.13 and $95,824.39. However, it formed an ATH at $109,114 on January 20. In the weeks of February, the price of BTC dropped heavily as it dropped toward the $78K low. In March, the price of Bitcoin declined heavily and dropped toward a low of $76.6K. In April, the price of Bitcoin started recovering. By the end of April, it neared the critical $95K zone. In May, Bitcoin price skyrocketed and it formed a new ATH at $111,970. However, the price declined later, toward $104K. By the end of June, BTC price reclaimed the $108K level. In July, BTC price triggered a surge toward $123K; however, it faced strong selling pressure later. In mid-August, the price of Bitcoin surged above $124K. However, the price failed to maintain its momentum as it dropped below $110K in early-September.",Crypto Price Predictions|BTC,EN,0,0,REGULATION|BUSINESS|BTC|TRADING|MARKET|UNI|BLOCKCHAIN|FIAT|MACROECONOMICS|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-09-14 09:39:25

Key Takeaways: Shibarium’s bridge was exploited in a flash loan attack, draining nearly $3 million in ETH, SHIB, and KNINE tokens. The attacker gained two-thirds validator control by flash-loaning 4.6M BONE, enabling them to finalize fraudulent checkpoints. Developers paused staking and brought in security firms, while hinting at a potential bounty offer if the funds are returned. According to Shiba Inu developer Kaal Dhairya , the attacker used a flash loan to borrow 4.6 million BONE, the governance token of Shibarium, and managed to gain access to 10 out of 12 validator signing keys. That control gave them the two-thirds consensus required to finalize fraudulent checkpoints on the network’s consensus layer, Heimdall. Shibarium Attacker Drains $2.4M in ETH and SHIB With majority control in place, the attacker proceeded to drain around 224.57 ETH and 92.6 billion SHIB tokens from the Shibarium bridge contract, collectively worth approximately $2.4 million at the time. A further $700,000 in KNINE tokens tied to K9 Finance were also impacted. However, K9 Finance’s DAO moved swiftly to blacklist the attacker’s address, rendering the KNINE tokens unsellable. In response to the breach, Shibarium developers halted staking and unstaking across the network. Because the attacker’s borrowed BONE tokens remain subject to an unstaking delay, developers were able to freeze the position before full exit, effectively locking the attacker out of validator control for the time being. Dhairya described the exploit as “sophisticated” and suggested it was likely “planned for months.” Shibarium Bridge Security Update Earlier today, a sophisticated ( probably planned for months ) attack was carried out using a flash loan to purchase 4.6M BONE. The attacker gained access to validator signing keys, achieved majority validator power, and signed a malicious… — Kaal (@kaaldhairya) September 13, 2025 He confirmed that law enforcement has been contacted and that security firms Hexens, Seal 911, and PeckShield are now involved in the investigation. He also left the door open to negotiations, stating that if the attacker returns the funds, a bounty might be considered in lieu of legal action. Community researcher Zilayo on X provided a technical breakdown of the incident, pointing to suspicious validator behavior tied to Ryoshi Labs. The fraudulent checkpoint was signed by 10 validators who controlled around 40% of the stake. Once the attacker delegated the flash-loaned BONE to Ryoshi’s validator, the weighted stake surpassed 66%, enabling a full consensus takeover. Shibarium was attacked yesterday & the bridge drained for nearly $3m. Here's how it happened 1/ Ryoshi Labs' validator (and perhaps others) were compromised or malicious from the start. They proposed a fraudulent checkpoint on Heimdall (Shibarium's consensus engine). 2/… pic.twitter.com/yq1BdFYdra — Zilayo (@0xZilayo) September 13, 2025 The price of BONE spiked in the immediate aftermath of the attack, briefly rising from $0.165 to $0.294 before settling back around $0.202. SHIB, meanwhile, is up 4.5% in the past 24 hours, driven in part by renewed attention following the breach. Bitcoin Hacks, Thefts Cost Investors $2.2B in H1 2025: CertiK Crypto investors lost over $2.2 billion to hacks , scams, and breaches in the first half of 2025, driven largely by wallet compromises and phishing attacks, according to CertiK’s latest security report. Wallet breaches alone caused $1.7 billion in losses across just 34 incidents, while phishing scams accounted for over $410 million across 132 attacks. Two major incidents, including Bybit’s $1.5 billion hack in February and Cetus Protocol’s $225 million exploit in May, skewed the year’s losses upward, together accounting for nearly $1.78 billion. Without these, losses align more closely with previous years at around $690 million. Ethereum remained the primary target, suffering over $1.6 billion in losses across 175 events.

Savings accounts often offer under 2%, government bonds hover around 3-5%, and even high yield fixed deposits rarely exceed double digits. In contrast, XRP Tundra’s staking calculator shows returns that make those options look weak. With Tundra, staking XRP in certain Cryo Vaults can deliver base APYs in the range of 8–12% for short commitments. But for those who stake XRP + TUNDRA in a “Frostbite” style vault, returns jump significantly: up to 21% base APY, rising to 31.5% at the 90-day mark. That means someone staking a moderate amount could earn more in a few months than many earn in a full year through traditional yield instruments. Calculator-Backed Returns That Change the Game The XRP Tundra staking calculator provides transparent estimates based on real parameters: Vault type: Cryo / Cryostasis, Frostbite (XRP+TUNDRA), Glacier (TUNDRA only) Staking period: 7, 30, 60, or 90 days with increasing multipliers for longer terms Rewards paid in TUNDRA tokens; original XRP remains on XRPL throughout the staking period For example, the “Frostbite” vault gives roughly 21% APY for a 7-day stake. If the same vault is used with a 90-day stake, returns increase to around 31.5% APY. Fees are deducted in TUNDRA per deposit and withdrawal, which slightly lowers net returns, but even after fees the projected yield stays well above what traditional financial instruments offer. Comparing With Traditional Options Here’s how Tundra’s staking stacks up against standard yield vehicles: Option Approximate Return Savings account Government bond / Treasury note 3-5% High-yield fixed deposit / CD 7-10% in best cases XRP Tundra Cryo Vaults (90 days) ~12% APY XRP Tundra Frostbite Vaults (90 days) ~31.5% APY Even the base tier staking in Cryo Vaults delivers more than many fixed income instruments. And Frostbite vaults, which require staking XRP + TUNDRA together, give a dramatically higher reward for those willing to take slightly more risk or lock up capital longer. However, high returns often come with trade-offs. With Tundra: Lockup periods (7 to 90 days) mean capital is illiquid while staked. Rewards are in TUNDRA tokens, which have volatility risk tied to their own valuation. Operations require paying fees in TUNDRA for deposit and withdrawal, which slightly reduce net gains. Still, donors value how much more return is possible compared to bank yields, especially when inflation, taxes, and opportunity cost are factored in. Trust And Verification Security matters when returns look too good to be true. XRP Tundra has been audited by independent firms: Cyberscope , Solidproof , Freshcoins . The core team also passed full KYC verification with Vital Block . These checks include contract security, emissions schedules, fee structures, and token allocations to ensure everything works as advertised and returns are earned under known rules. What This Means For Investors For many XRP holders, the choice has been between banks with tiny returns or speculative plays. With Tundra staking, there’s now a third path: produce meaningful yield, keep custody, and operate on-ledger. If your capital is locked for 90 days, Frostbite vaults could deliver returns multiples higher than traditional fixed income. Even conservative staking with XRPL-only vaults looks far better than savings accounts or CDs for many markets. This makes XRP Tundra an attractive option for those who want returns now, not just from long-term price moves.

The Allure of XRP Tundra Staking XRP Tundra introduces an innovative staking mechanism across platforms like the XRP Ledger and Solana, providing remarkably high annual percentage yields (APY). Their specialized staking calculator, designed for transparency, showcases potential earnings that far exceed those of conventional financial products. How Does Staking with XRP Tundra Work? Staking with XRP Tundra involves locking up XRP alone or in combination with TUNDRA tokens in different types of vaults—Cryo, Frostbite, or Glacier. Each vault type offers varying degrees of returns based on the staking period and the combination of cryptocurrencies staked. Profitability of Different Vault Types The Frostbite vaults, for instance, offer an enticing base APY of 21%, which can escalate to approximately 31.5% for staking periods as short as 90 days. This is a significant enhancement compared to the modest APYs provided by traditional banks or high-yield CDs. Comparative Analysis of Returns Financial OptionApproximate YieldSavings Account Ensuring Security and Trust in Staking To ensure the security and reliability of their staking platform, XRP Tundra has been rigorously audited by reputable firms like Cyberscope , Solidproof , and Freshcoins .

Price action suggests the market is consolidating after previous advances, with resistance levels around $240 and support around $220. Investors are paying attention to both technical charts and market sentiment in an attempt to assess potential near-term behavior. Meanwhile, there is also growing curiosity in the broader crypto ecosystem towards new DeFi players such as Mutuum Finance. Official Bug Bounty Program Mutuum Finance, in collaboration with CertiK, is launching an official Bug Bounty Program with a prize pool of $50,000 USDT. The program is open to accepting white-hat hackers and security researchers to find bugs in the project’s codebase. Bugs are classified on a severity scale, critical, major, minor, and low, and accordingly, prizes are distributed. The aims of the program are to strengthen the security of the platform, protect investors, and safeguard users across the ecosystem. Dynamic Interest and Liquidity Models Mutuum Finance has a liquidity-balanced dynamic interest rate model. In times of low interest rates, lending is appealing, so participants borrow and use the platform more intensively. Conversely, higher rates induce repayments and subsequent funding inputs. Highly liquid assets are well-suited for fixed rates of interest, stabilizing while allowing renegotiation on account of changes in the market. As a fully decentralized platform, the MUTM token holders possess the governance rights, providing borrowers with autonomy while ensuring system sustainability. The interest rate architecture encourages long-term efficiency, enables automatic portfolio diversification, and ensures that the platform remains responsive to the continually evolving DeFi environment. Accurate Price Discovery Correct pricing helps in the process of borrowing, lending, and liquidation. Mutuum Finance uses Chainlink oracles to give market prices in USD as well as natively supported tokens such as ETH, MATIC, and AVAX. Fallback oracles, composite feeds, and time-weighted averages from decentralized exchanges are also integrated on the platform for correct valuations even in the case of distressed market conditions. Dual-Layer Lending Framework Mutuum Finance utilizes a two-layer lending platform that provides users with two options: Peer-to-Peer (P2P) lending or Peer-to-Contract (P2C) lending. In P2C, intelligent contracts proactively monitor markets to optimize interest payments, allowing lenders to lend and reward investors with automated interest sharing. In the P2P structure, lenders and borrowers bargain directly without the mediation of middlemen, offering more autonomy and flexibility. This two-pronged approach balances between efficiency and liberty, making the lending system reliable and easy. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is emerging as a high-performing DeFi altcoin, while Solana (SOL) aims for a potential 3x return. Stage 6 tokens are at $0.035 and will rise 14.29% to $0.04 at Stage 7. Presale has already raised $15.68M with 16,280+ investors, signaling strong demand. MUTM combines a $50K CertiK bug bounty, dynamic interest and liquidity protocols, dual P2C/P2P lending, and governance management, ensuring security, flexibility, and long-term scalability. Secure Stage 6 tokens now ahead of the next price surge.

CEO Brian Armstrong announced the transparency initiative amid ongoing disputes with projects claiming the exchange demanded substantial payments for token listings. The guide comes as Coinbase struggles with declining revenues and trading volumes. Second-quarter results showed $1.5 billion in revenue, missing analyst expectations of $1.59 billion, while consumer trading volume dropped 45% to $43 billion. Net income plummeted to $33.2 million from $294.4 million in Q2 2024. Source: Coinbase Coinbase stock dropped 9.2% in after-hours trading following Q2 results, but has gained nearly 50% year-to-date. XRP emerged as an unexpected revenue bright spot, generating 13% of consumer transaction revenue compared to Ethereum’s 12% for the second consecutive quarter. Detailed Process Addresses Fee Controversy The listing guide outlines a five-step evaluation process, including application submission, business assessment, and core reviews covering legal, compliance, and technical security factors. Coinbase emphasizes that listings connect projects to deep liquidity and a global customer base within a trusted regulatory framework. The exchange addresses common roadblocks, including securities risk assessments based on public statements and marketing materials. According to the guideline, projects highlighting token utility and governance rights face smoother reviews than those promising speculative returns or “moon” scenarios. Average due diligence takes one week, with trading enabled within two weeks of approval, though timelines vary significantly based on asset complexity. Tokens on supported networks, including Ethereum, Base, Solana, Arbitrum, Optimism, Polygon, and Avalanche, receive expedited processing compared to new blockchain integrations. We get a ton of questions about how and why assets get listed on Coinbase. To be more transparent we wrote a guide on how it all works. TL;DR: listings are free and merit-based. Every asset is evaluated against the same standards. Link in replies. pic.twitter.com/HmqQDt6085 — Brian Armstrong (@brian_armstrong) September 12, 2025 The guide coincides with Coinbase’s strategic pivot toward becoming an “everything exchange” supporting millions of tokens through decentralized exchange integration. Since then, Armstrong has announced plans to eliminate intensive listing barriers that have limited asset additions. As part of the guideline, the exchange’s phased market launch process includes transfer-only periods, limit order auctions, and full trading states designed to protect market integrity during new asset introductions. Notably, this new transparency guideline follows multiple allegations of misconduct. Earlier in November 2024, TRON founder Justin Sun disputed Armstrong’s free listing claims , alleging that Coinbase requested 500 million TRX worth $80 million plus a $250 million Bitcoin deposit in Coinbase Custody. Sun noted that Binance listed TRON without fees, while Sonic Labs co-founder Andre Cronje also reported similar experiences with Coinbase demanding $30-300 million. Revenue Pressures Drive New Monetization Strategies Amid Market Challenges Last month, Coinbase introduced a 0.1% fee on USDC-to-USD conversions exceeding $5 million within 30-day periods starting August 13. This was the first monetization of previously free stablecoin off-ramping services. The change addresses competitive disadvantages from Tether’s existing redemption fees that made USDC the cheapest route for large-scale fiat conversions. The fee implementation triggered user backlash, comparing Coinbase to traditional banking institutions. CEO Armstrong defended the decision as necessary to address arbitrage opportunities where users swapped USDT to USDC before converting to USD, reducing USDC supply while maintaining USDT circulation. @Coinbase is turning to the bond market for support after a disappointing second-quarter earnings report triggered a sell-off in its stock. #Coinbase #Coin https://t.co/QAMu3x06KO — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) August 5, 2025 Following disappointing Q2 results, Coinbase also announced a $2 billion convertible senior notes offering split between 2029 and 2032 maturities. Proceeds will fund capped call transactions to limit share dilution and support corporate needs, including working capital, acquisitions, and debt repurchases. The company purchased 2,509 Bitcoin worth $222 million during Q2, bringing total holdings to 11,776 BTC and placing it among the top 10 public holders ahead of Tesla. However, Bitcoin accumulation couldn’t offset broader revenue declines affecting overall performance. Coinbase continues expanding revenue streams through prediction markets, tokenized stocks, and derivatives for U.S. users. The exchange secured a European MiCA license through Luxembourg’s financial regulator while pursuing partnerships, including Chase Ultimate Rewards point transfers to crypto wallets. Despite financial challenges, TIME also recognized Coinbase as one of 2025’s 100 Most Influential Companies, labeling it a “disruptor” for shaping U.S. digital asset policies and predicting it could become the central hub for American crypto trading. The regulatory landscape supporting Coinbase’s transparency push includes the SEC’s Project Crypto initiative , which aims to enable on-chain financial markets, and the GENIUS Act , which creates frameworks for payment stablecoins.

Among the projects are Ozak AI (OZ) , a presale token merging artificial intelligence and blockchain; Cardano (ADA), a research-based Layer-1 community; and Polygon (MATIC), Ethereum’s main scaling solution. With analysts highlighting strong fundamentals for ADA and Polygon and 100× ROI forecasts for Ozak AI, those 3 cryptos are positioning themselves as potential outperformers to Ethereum. Ozak AI: Presale Star With 100× Potential Ozak AI (OZ) is one of the quickest-developing presales of 2025, already raising greater than $3 million at a token price of just $0.01. Positioned on the intersection of AI and blockchain, Ozak AI aspires to create smarter, adaptive, decentralized programs, supplying both narrative strength and real-world innovation. Analysts advise OZ may want to surge to $1 or better, delivering 100× returns for early participants. With this method, even a modest $500 allocation nowadays could grow into $50,000 on the projected target. With each whale and crypto trader collecting, Ozak AI is emerging as one of the most explosive possibilities in the market. Cardano: Research-Driven Layer-1 Growth Cardano (ADA), trading at $0.9247, has long been known for its peer-reviewed approach to blockchain development and a strong emphasis on scalability and sustainability. With the recent Chang hard fork upgrade and growing adoption of decentralized applications on its network, ADA is set to benefit from increased utility. From a technical perspective, ADA faces resistance at $0.95, $1.10, and $1.25, while support sits at $0.90, $0.85, and $0.80. Analysts believe ADA could push toward $5 in the next cycle, offering a solid 5× return for long-term holders. While not as explosive as OZ presale tokens, Cardano’s credibility and ecosystem strength make it a reliable Layer-1 contender. Polygon: Ethereum’s Scaling Powerhouse Polygon (MATIC), priced at $0.28, continues to play a critical role in scaling Ethereum by reducing transaction fees and increasing speed. Its adoption across DeFi, NFTs, and gaming remains strong, with partnerships spanning enterprises and Web3 developers. On the charts, MATIC faces resistance at $0.30, $0.35, and $0.40, while support holds at $0.27, $0.25, and $0.22. Analysts forecast a rally toward $5 in the next bull run, offering nearly an 18× return from current levels. While larger-cap than Ozak AI, Polygon provides investors a more established, safer play with long-term potential. Ozak AI, Cardano, and Polygon are three cryptos that could outperform Ethereum in 2025. Cardano at $0.9247 offers research-driven growth with a realistic path to $5, while Polygon at $0.28 remains Ethereum’s top scaling solution with upside toward $5 as well. Yet, it is Ozak AI’s $0.01 presale entry, $3 million raised, and 100× ROI forecast that truly positions it as the standout. For investors chasing exponential returns, Ozak AI offers the kind of ground-floor opportunity that Cardano and Polygon once provided in their earliest days. About Ozak AI Ozak AI is a blockchain-based crypto project that provides an innovative platform that focuses on predictive AI and advanced data analytics for financial markets. Through machine learning algorithms and decentralized community technologies, Ozak AI enables real-time, accurate, and actionable insights to help crypto lovers and corporations make the perfect choices.

However, as we approach 2025, the spotlight begins to shift towards new contenders, like Ozak AI (OZ) , Cardano (ADA), and Polygon (MATIC), which are poised for potential high growth. The Next Generation of Crypto Innovations Ozak AI: A New Frontier in AI and Blockchain Ozak AI distinguishes itself by integrating artificial intelligence with blockchain technology, aiming for a transformative impact on decentralized applications. This project, currently in the presale phase, has already garnered significant interest, raising over $3 million with tokens priced at just $0.01. With predictions of its value potentially reaching $1, Ozak AI could deliver returns up to 100 times for early investors. This has attracted both individual crypto enthusiasts and large-scale investors. Cardano: Sustainable and Scalable Blockchain Known for its rigorous peer-review system and academic approach, Cardano continues to be a formidable player in the blockchain sphere. Recent technological advancements and an increase in dApp integration have enhanced ADA's utility and adoption. With its price poised just below the $1 mark, technical analysis shows potential resistance and support levels, forecasting a possible rise to $5 per ADA in the near future. Polygon: Enhancing Ethereum's Capabilities Polygon serves as a scaling solution for Ethereum, facilitating faster transactions and reduced fees. Its utility across various applications in DeFi, NFTs, and gaming secures its position as a crucial element in the Ethereum ecosystem. Currently valued at $0.28, MATIC shows potential for significant growth with projections reaching as high as $5, representing a substantial increase from current figures. In summary, while Ethereum remains a powerhouse, the rising stars of Ozak AI, Cardano, and Polygon are setting the stage for potentially higher gains in the crypto market.

51704490,https://timestabloid.com/?p=82972,1757844024,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/67/default.png,Cardano (ADA) vs. Mutuum Finance (MUTM): Which Crypto to Buy Today for Long-Term 20x Potential?,https://timestabloid.com/cardano-ada-vs-mutuum-finance-mutm-which-crypto-to-buy/,"Crypto investors are always hunting for tokens that can transform modest sums into life-changing gains. Cardano (ADA) once offered exactly that, but in today’s market, attention is shifting to new contenders. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) , priced at just $0.035, is increasingly being described as one of the few early-stage tokens capable of delivering a 20x return over the next cycle. Cardano (ADA) Cardano’s history provides the perfect example of what early adoption can achieve. In its early days, ADA traded for mere cents. A $500 investment at $0.02 secured 25,000 tokens. When ADA later surged above $2 during the bull market, that stake ballooned into more than $50,000. Stories like these cemented Cardano’s reputation as one of the great wealth-generating plays of the last cycle, rewarding early believers with once-in-a-lifetime multiples. Today, however, ADA trades at around $0.88 with a market cap north of $31 billion. While it remains a respected blue-chip with active development and a vast ecosystem, the sheer scale of its valuation makes another 100× surge virtually impossible. Even a doubling or tripling of ADA’s price would require billions in fresh inflows, delivering respectable returns but far from the exponential upside it once offered. This reality is why investors seeking the next breakout are now turning toward projects like Mutuum Finance, tokens with smaller starting valuations but equally ambitious roadmaps. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Mutuum Finance is a decentralized lending and borrowing protocol designed to bring functionality from the very start. Unlike projects that wait months or years after listing to introduce products, Mutuum will launch with its beta platform live on day one, allowing users to lend, borrow, and participate as liquidators immediately. The presale numbers already show strong momentum. To date, over $15.65 million has been raised, with more than 16,250 holders onboard and upwards of 710 million tokens sold. Currently in Phase 6 at $0.035, the price is set to jump to $0.040 in the next phase, before officially listing at $0.06. That means investors entering today are locking in nearly 100% gains. Mechanics Driving MUTM’s Growth and Price Targets Mutuum Finance’s strength lies in its design, which is built to create lasting demand for MUTM tokens well beyond the presale stage. Its dual-lending markets combine both variable and stable borrowing options, striking a balance that keeps liquidity active and ensures borrowers and lenders alike are incentivized to participate. This foundation gives Mutuum Finance a sustainable system rather than a short-lived hype cycle. Another key driver is the introduction of mtTokens, which give depositors yield-bearing assets that remain liquid. Holders can earn passive income while still moving their capital across DeFi, making their funds work in more than one place at once. On top of this, the buy-and-distribute mechanism continuously recycles protocol fees into purchasing MUTM from the open market, creating steady buy pressure that supports long-term price growth. Together, these features are designed to compound demand as adoption grows. The first major price catalyst comes at launch. With the beta platform going live and the listing price set at $0.06, analysts expect adoption to quickly push MUTM toward $0.2–$0.3 in the first few months. For Phase 6 investors at $0.035, that translates into a potential 7-10x return in less than a year. Mid-term growth is expected to remain strong as mtTokens and the buy-and-distribute cycle continue to generate momentum, with predictions placing MUTM in the $1.00–$1.25 range within 12 months. Looking further ahead, long-term expansion will be shaped by major roadmap milestones. The launch of an overcollateralized stablecoin is expected to anchor liquidity and create recurring borrowing flows, while Layer-2 integration will cut transaction costs and make the platform more scalable for both retail and institutional users. With these upgrades in place, analysts forecast that MUTM could climb to around $1.75–$2 by 2026, representing more than 20x growth from today’s presale level. The Next Life-Changing Opportunity The difference between an established blue-chip and an early-stage token becomes clear with a simple example. A $650 investment in Cardano at $0.88 would secure roughly 740 ADA. If ADA climbed to $1.25, that position would be worth about $925. It’s a respectable gain, but far from the kind of transformational returns that early adopters once enjoyed. Now consider the same $650 invested in MUTM at $0.035. At launch, that stake would already be worth around $1,115 when the price hits $0.06. When MUTM climbs to $0.40 in its adoption phase, the position would jump to more than $7,400. And once it reaches its longer-term forecast of $1.85, that same $650 would grow to over $34,000. That contrast shows exactly why investors who once profited from ADA’s early surge are now shifting focus to MUTM. Cardano’s early days created life-changing wealth for small investors, turning pocket-sized stakes into tens of thousands of dollars. But as a large-cap today, its potential for exponential multiples has diminished. Mutuum Finance now represents the kind of early-stage opportunity that ADA once was, a token with tangible utility, strong presale momentum, and a roadmap that directly connects features to price growth. With the presale in Phase 6 at $0.035, set to rise to $0.040 and officially listing at $0.06, early buyers are already positioned for near-double returns before exchanges even open. From there, the path to a potential 20x gain by 2026 is supported by structural mechanics, growing adoption, and long-term scalability plans. For those asking whether Cardano or Mutuum Finance offers the better chance at significant upside today, the answer is clear. ADA has matured into a strong but stable blue-chip. MUTM, on the other hand, is still at the stage where early entry could mean catching the next wave of life-changing returns.

Previous Comments Spark Speculation,https://timestabloid.com/was-charlie-kirk-an-xrp-holder-previous-comments-spark-speculation/,"A resurfaced interview has renewed interest in conservative commentator Charlie Kirk’s connection to cryptocurrency. The video, posted by Amelie (@_Crypto_Barbie), a prominent XRP enthusiast, shows Kirk distancing himself from Bitcoin while hinting at a stronger position in another asset. His remarks suggested involvement with XRP, a cryptocurrency many in the community consider central to the industry’s future. The renewed focus comes just days after Kirk’s assassination, which has drawn widespread attention across political and cultural circles. When asked during the interview if he owned Bitcoin, Kirk responded, “I actually have better stuff than that. I am a significant investor in the plumbing of how crypto is made.” Many observers believe he was referring to XRP, which has long been positioned as more than a speculative token and as a part of the infrastructure supporting global digital transactions . WOW! Was Charlie Kirk an #XRP holder? „Do you invest in Bitcoin?“ „I actually have better stuff than that!“ He seemed to know something most don’t… Vid credit: @KingKaranCrypto pic.twitter.com/tsceUubdNv — 𝓐𝓶𝓮𝓵𝓲𝓮 (@_Crypto_Barbie) September 13, 2025 The Weight of Kirk’s Remarks Kirk’s death added gravity to the resurfacing of the interview. For his supporters in the crypto community, the timing reinforced the belief that he had recognized the potential of XRP earlier than most. They viewed his statement as evidence that he was aligned with a project they see as a cornerstone of the financial system. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Amelie highlighted this in her post, suggesting that Kirk likely knew something about XRP that many others did not. Her framing of the clip emphasized that his comments were not casual but rooted in a deeper understanding of the asset’s utility . To many of her followers, this confirmed suspicions that influential figures had insight into XRP before it gained broader recognition. Positioning Against Bitcoin Kirk’s comment that he did not hold Bitcoin reinforced the notion that his focus lay elsewhere. Within the crypto community, supporters often compare XRP to Bitcoin, seeing the former as more advanced in terms of utility and efficiency. Some even argue that XRP’s code predates Bitcoin , seeing it as a foundational part of the crypto industry. For Kirk, a figure already aligned with American nationalist values, support for XRP was taken by his followers as consistent with broader political ideals. Much like Donald Trump, who has also been praised for his pro-American and pro-crypto stance , many saw Kirk as a visionary willing to challenge established narratives.
