This surge in activity is a welcome change of pace after a slowdown earlier in the year due to market volatility influenced by Trump’s tariff policies. The week’s success is also proof of renewed investor appetite for tech, fintech, and crypto-related listings. Klarna, Figure, and Gemini led the charge Some of the notable IPOs involved Klarna, Figure , Gemini, Legence, Black Rock Coffee Bar, and Via Transportation. Among the newcomers are significant players in various sectors, showcasing a diverse range of industries entering the public market. The lineup was much broader than expected, spanning industries and testing the waters for a potential fall IPO boom. Among the six IPOs, five were worth at least $290 million, priced above their marketed ranges. However, their performances post-listing have not been as positive. Nevertheless, Wall Street analysts have called this a sign of healthy skepticism among investors, which they say bodes well for the market going forward. Klarna has since inched toward its offering price, while Figure Technology Solutions Inc. ended its second day of trading near a high hit in the opening minutes of its debut. Among the four listings from Friday, Gemini Space Station Inc. has soared, while Blackstone-backed Legence Corp. and Via Transportation Inc. have been left with at best modest gains after opening below their IPO prices. This week’s set of deals is being considered as a gauge for how active the stock market is getting, and the results are mixed. All the IPOs witnessed strong demand in the formal marketing process before trading began, with many selling bigger stakes than they had initially offered. Despite rough starts, analysts claim things have been smooth compared to ailing deals from earlier this year that continue to struggle underwater. Experts expect the relative calm to entice more companies to go public, even though investors are still somewhat choosy over valuations and earnings. “Investor expectations remain high and continue to be demanding — profitability and fundamentals are huge,” said Mike Bellin, who leads PricewaterhouseCoopers’ IPO practice. “Some companies were very conservative with their prices because we’re still in an uncertain market.” Next week is expected to be equally active as Stubhub Holdings Inc., Netskope Inc., and others plan to go public. The group could raise up to $2.53 billion combined, and that would mark the first back-to-back weeks of such volumes in US IPOs that do not include SPACs, REITs, and closed-end funds since December 2021. The week’s activity is not permanent, analysts warn The US IPO market has had a strong start this month, but even with the welcome activity, the IPO market is still in recovery compared to pre-pandemic levels. There are those who don’t see the renewed activity as permanent either. Kati Penney, the corporate transactions lead at CrossCountry Consulting, is one of those who expect the market to dial back. She has tagged the week’s activity as an “anomaly” that can be linked to a return of large, well-known names whose processes were paused due to market volatility related to President Donald Trump’s chaotic tariff policies in April. The chaos kept several late-stage startups sidelined for months as investor demand for new deals soured. “We’ll see steady momentum but not at the pace of these past two weeks,” Penney said in an interview. “It also seems to be a bit more concentrated in some of these industries around technology — crypto, AI.” That was confirmed in the past week as the week’s largest deals came from Klarna and Figure, where both had investor orders for roughly 25 times more stock than was sold, according to Bloomberg News .

But when it comes to 2025, the quest for turning $100 into $1,000 is still to be fulfilled. Can the established meme coins like PEPE, Bonk Coin, and Shiba Inu, with their life changing history backing them, be the $1,000 contenders? But something is stirring the market: Layer Brett ($LBRETT) and its presale . Can it convert your $100 into $1,000? Layer Brett: Can its Presale make 10x your $100? Layer 2 isn’t slowing down — it’s gearing up to dominate, with estimates showing more than ten trillion dollars flowing through it annually by 2027. The push comes from a simple truth: crypto users want speed, affordability, and scale. Layer Brett isn’t here to play safe. It takes the raw power of Layer 2 infrastructure and fuses it with the chaos of meme culture. The result? Blazing-fast transactions, fees so tiny they barely register, and a staking system built to reward the bold. Early entrants can secure more than a staggering 700% APY. But the longer you wait, the smaller the payout — and the bigger the FOMO. With $LBRETT presale priced at just $0.0055 , this is the type of setup that latecomers will only dream about. Combine instant staking, a one million dollar prize pool, and true decentralization, and you’re looking at a project that experts say can convert your $100 to $1,000 before the next year. PEPE: A Meme’s Technical Takeover PEPE’s future looks very bright. The technical charts show a significant “golden cross” on its moving averages, which is supported by a clear breakout from a long-term trading range. This strong technical setup, combined with renewed interest from investors, means PEPE has the potential for a massive rally. A $100 investment in PEPE could reasonably see a 3x to 6x return, turning into $300 to $600. BONK’s Big Bark BONK is set for a major price jump this year. The charts show a powerful MAs golden cross, and it broke out of a long-term pattern. A $100 BONK investment could grow significantly. Some experts believe it could be $300 by the end of 2025. SHIB’s Next Leg Up SHIB is also poised for a significant rally through the end of 2025. A clear golden cross signals a major upward trend. This move is supported by a bullish flag pattern, with SHIB taking a short rest before a big jump. Some analysts predict a price increase of 3x to 4x, making your $100 become $300-$400. Best bet to make $1,000 PEPE, Bonk Coin, and Shiba Inu are all meme coins, and their hyped nature means that they can (and do) rise faster than the rest of the market. But 2 facts impact their predicted gains: First, all three meme coins have substantial market caps, making big gains difficult, if possible. Secondly, they are pure hypes, and everyone knows that meme coins, where they can rise, can also crash hard. Layer Brett ($LBRETT), however, has a small market cap and merges DeFi with meme coins, giving it a purpose that neither PEPE, Bonk Coin, nor SHIB has. If you want to convert your $100 into $1,000, Layer Brett is your best bet. The presale is on , and you can only make $1,000 if you join now.

Mutuum Finance stands at Stage 6 of presale and has set the token at $0.035. Stage 7 is a 14.29% increase to $0.04. The campaign has reached more than $15.63 million and more than 16,240+ investors have invested to date. Given SHIB has had a strong community presence, institutional investors are closely monitoring the momentum of MUTM as a vehicle to ride the next crypto bull run. Shiba Inu (SHIB) Status Update SHIB trades at $0.00001317 as of now. Shiba Inu has been trending sideways in recent times, its price fluctuating between $0.0000129 and $0.0000132, showing marginal gains but also points of resistance. While developments in the ecosystem like Shibarium and token burns remain in the cards, overall momentum remains cautious, and whales and investors await better clues. While SHIB remains on this stage, new DeFi-projects like Mutuum Finance are starting to garner investor interest. Official Bug Bounty Program Mutuum Finance and CertiK have established an official Bug Bounty Program with the $50,000 USDT bounty for white-hat hackers to help discover bugs in the project codebase. The program focuses on potential issues on four levels of severity: critical, major, minor, and low. Its objectives are to enhance security, protect investors, and protect users on the platform. Interest and Liquidity Models The project utilizes a dynamic interest rate model to keep the liquidity of the platform in equilibrium. Low interest rates cause individuals to borrow more if money borrowed is in high demand. Individuals will pay a premium and introduce more funds into the system if interest levels are low. Fixed interest rates can also be applied to borrowing, which is larger than floating but re-negotiable every time there are fluctuations in the conditions of the market. Fixed interest rates are only utilized in highly liquid assets. Mutuum Finance is decentralized and MUTM holders are in control. Borrowers have freedom, and system interest rate design ensures long-term sustainability and efficiency. The design also allows for automatic diversification of purchases, and the platform is therefore sustainable and responsive in the DeFi economy. Price Discovery Correct price data must be present so that borrowing, lending, and liquidation can be secure. Mutuum Finance uses Chainlink oracles to supply the system with USD and native token market prices such as ETH, MATIC, and AVAX. The system relies on fallback oracles, combined feed, and time-weighted average decentralized exchange prices to keep valuations as precise in stress market conditions. Lending: Dual-Layer Lending Framework The project’s double-lending mechanism offers consumers a balance between borrowing Peer-to-Peer lending (P2P) or lending directly from smart contracts (P2C) The P2C mechanism involves smart contracts constantly monitoring markets to receive maximum interest payment so that the borrowers can lend sensibly directly with the automatic payment of interest to investors. P2P platform gives the lender and the borrower a chance to negotiate between themselves independently without relying on any middleman, thus providing freedom and autonomy on the platform. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is becoming one of the top whales’ targets for the next major bull run ride. Stage 6 tokens are priced at $0.035, while Stage 7 price will rise by 14.29% to $0.04. The project has already collected $15.63M and attracted 16,240+ investors with strong early traction. As SHIB is consolidating at $0.00001317, whales are entering MUTM for higher upside. Purchase Stage 6 tokens now before the next price hike.

While many expected approval in September, the regulator has pushed the deadline further, citing the need for “additional review.” This move mirrors the repeated delays faced by Ethereum and XRP ETFs, signaling that the SEC is still cautious about giving green lights to altcoins beyond Bitcoin. Despite the regulatory setbacks, Solana’s market performance has remained strong. Trading near $225, SOL has held its ground, buoyed by consistent on-chain activity and continued developer adoption. Investors seem less concerned about the short-term delays and more focused on Solana’s longer-term trajectory as one of the most scalable Layer-1 blockchains in the industry. Amid this environment, retail traders are not only eyeing Solana but also looking at presales like MAGACOIN FINANCE, which offer early exposure and high-growth potential before broader exchange listings. Solana’s strength amid regulatory uncertainty Even without ETF approval, Solana has shown impressive resilience. Daily active addresses remain high, DeFi activity on the network continues to climb, and transaction speeds maintain their edge over most competitors. Solana’s ability to weather negative headlines reflects the growing maturity of its ecosystem. Whales appear to agree. On-chain trackers reveal that large wallets have been quietly accumulating SOL, viewing the delays as temporary rather than a deal-breaker. This steady accumulation has helped keep Solana above key support levels, giving confidence to retail investors watching from the sidelines. MAGACOIN FINANCE in the spotlight before listings Limited allocations left – MAGACOIN FINANCE’s current presale tier nearly oversubscribed. Analysts argue this is one of the strongest indicators of retail demand in the presale market. The project’s rapid growth reflects both strong community engagement and institutional-style interest, as whales have started participating in recent weeks. The appeal of MAGACOIN FINANCE lies in its positioning as a hybrid: it captures the viral momentum typical of meme coins while pairing it with a structured roadmap, audited contracts, and real ecosystem goals. For traders wary of regulatory delays on major tokens like Solana, MAGACOIN FINANCE offers an alternative – a ground-floor opportunity before mainstream exposure. Technical analysis for SOL On the charts, Solana has strong support near $200, with additional layers around $180. Resistance sits at $250, followed by $290. A breakout above $250 could accelerate momentum, opening the door to $290 as the next target. Conversely, failure to hold above $200 may trigger a pullback to $180 or even lower. Momentum indicators remain supportive, with RSI readings showing that SOL is not yet overbought. Trading volumes have held steady, further reinforcing confidence in the asset’s stability despite ETF delays. Institutional outlook While the SEC has postponed decisions, analysts point out that institutional interest in Solana is real. Asset managers view SOL as one of the most compelling alternatives to Ethereum for scaling, DeFi, and consumer-facing apps. Once ETF approval eventually arrives, the potential for significant inflows remains high. For now, traders see the delays as opportunities to accumulate before a longer-term breakout. Broader market trends Bitcoin’s stability above $114,000 and Ethereum’s consolidation have created a supportive backdrop for altcoins. The “altseason index” has been rising steadily, indicating that traders are rotating capital into alternative Layer-1 tokens. Solana, Cardano, and emerging presales like MAGACOIN FINANCE are among the biggest beneficiaries of this trend. Global macroeconomic conditions also support the case for risk assets. With the Federal Reserve expected to cut rates this month, liquidity is increasing across markets, which typically benefits both equities and crypto. Conclusion Solana’s latest ETF delay may frustrate traders, but it hasn’t derailed the network’s momentum. With strong on-chain activity, steady whale accumulation, and a resilient price above $200, SOL remains one of the top altcoins to watch heading into October. At the same time, presale projects like MAGACOIN FINANCE are capturing unprecedented demand, with its current tier nearly oversubscribed. Together, SOL and MAGACOIN FINANCE showcase two sides of the altcoin opportunity: one established, the other emerging, both with high potential as the bull market unfolds.

Known as XLS-86 Firewall , the amendment is designed to block scams and stop the loss of XRP tokens from wallets—a long-awaited safeguard for a community that has endured heavy losses in the past. How The New XRP Ledger Update Will Protect Investors The XRP Ledger is preparing to roll out one of its most significant security-focused updates, known as the XLS-86 Firewall. Announced by a dUNL Validator identified as ‘Vet’ on X social media, the proposal aims to provide a safeguard against the increasing number of scams targeting XRP holders . At its core, the amendment is created to give investors greater control over how their transactions are executed, limiting the chances of bad actors draining their wallets . The firewall will allow account owners to impose customized restrictions on outgoing transactions, including time-based limits and value-based thresholds. This means that even if an attacker manages to gain access to a private key, they cannot instantly withdraw funds from the account. Instead, these restrictions buy valuable time for the legitimate owner to react and secure their holdings. Another vital component of the amendment is the “whitelist” mechanism. With this feature, investors can authorize a list of trusted accounts that are exempt from firewall restrictions, ensuring that daily transactions are not disrupted. This design balances security with usability, giving users confidence that their systems are protected without adding unnecessary friction to daily workflows. Notably, activation of the firewall is left to the user’s discretion, allowing them to tailor security to their needs and risk tolerance. For retail investors and small enterprises, the upgrade offers a critical advantage by providing an extra layer of protection against scam attacks . Traditionally, multisignature protection has been touted as a robust security layer; however, it remains complicated for the average user to implement. By contrast, the upcoming XRPL firewall offers a more accessible solution that complements existing transaction flows. Its simplicity and promised defense against unauthorized transfers make it a potentially game-changing new security upgrade for XRP holders. Why XRPL Needed A Firewall Security Upgrade The development of the XLS-86 Firewall did not arise independently but as a response to persistent and growing threats against the XRP community . Over the years, malicious actors have repeatedly exploited unsuspecting investors, employing tactics that range from phishing campaigns to impersonation scams. Just recently, the CTO of Ripple, David Schwartz, flagged a fake airdrop scheme that could have inflicted serious losses on unsuspecting investors had it gone unnoticed. Currently, the XRP Ledger does not provide any built-in safeguards to stop a compromised account from being drained instantly. However, with the development of the new firewall upgrade, XRP investors will be allowed to set protective rules that delay or restrict suspicious outgoing transfers, reducing the likelihood of catastrophic financial losses while still giving them full custody of their funds.",XRP|David Schwartz|dUNL Validator|ripple|XLS-86 Firewall|XRP Ledger|XRP news|XRP price|XRPL|XRPUSD|XRPUSDT,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|XRP|BUSINESS|WALLET|AIRDROP,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-09-13 20:00:40

The survey collected responses from 111 out of 190 Guild members and found that most are earning 50% to 60% less than their peers in similar roles. Compensation Gap Median salaries for surveyed Ethereum developers came in at about $140,000, compared with offers averaging $300,000 at rival projects. The report also detailed pay by area of focus, with average salaries at $130,000 for client developers, $215,000 for researchers, and $130,000 for coordination roles. Additionally, these contributors said that they don’t get any equity or token exposure from their employers. The general allocation was $0, with only 37% of respondents receiving anything. On the other hand, final-stage offers made to their peers at rival organizations in the past year included a median equity or token share of 6.5%. This ranges from cofounder-level allocations of 10% to 30% to early employee grants of 0.1% to 3%. The gap has created pressure; almost 40% of respondents have received outside job offers in the past year. In total, 108 were disclosed across 42 individuals, with the average package reaching $359,000. Some developers said they had been offered as much as $700,000 to move elsewhere. Closing the Pay Disparity Established in 2022, Protocol Guild has become a lifeline for such developers. Backed by the “1% Pledge” from projects including EigenLayer, Ether.fi, Taiko, and Puffer, the group has distributed over $33 million since launch. VanEck also pledged 10% of profits from its spot Ether ETF to the initiative in 2023. Over the last 12 months, the average Guild member received $66,000 through this funding, while the median distribution was $74,285. That support represented nearly one-third of total annual compensation for many employees, with the mean pay rising from $140,000 to $207,121. Survey responses show how important this extra support has been, with 59% of participants rating Guild funding as “very” or “extremely important” to their ability to keep working on Ethereum. The network has secured nearly $1 trillion in value, serves millions of users, and powers thousands of applications reliant on key upgrades. Protocol Guild warned that inadequate compensation puts Ethereum at risk by undermining developer retention, slowing progress on the roadmap, and threatening long-term neutrality. The group also emphasized that aligning pay with market rates is important to keep talent in place and ensure the ecosystem’s future growth.

In that episode, titled “Frinkcoin,” Professor Frink invents a digital currency that skyrockets in popularity, catapulting him to sudden wealth. Amelie highlights this storyline as more than simple satire, arguing that it reflects a long-planned financial transformation in which XRP now sits at the heart. From Satire to Symbolism For decades, The Simpsons has been celebrated for comedy that occasionally mirrors real-world developments, from smartwatches to political events. “Frinkcoin,” which aired on February 23, 2020, offered a humorous but surprisingly detailed look at cryptocurrency’s potential to reshape money and power. Amelie suggests the episode’s portrayal of a breakthrough digital asset prefigures today’s growing institutional embrace of blockchain technology. While the cartoon is fiction, its depiction of rapid adoption and cultural upheaval resonates with current debates around XRP’s role in the next phase of global finance. The Simpsons told us again It’s all planned for a long time… and #XRP is right in the center of it! pic.twitter.com/83O85EGBHK — 𝓐𝓶𝓮𝓵𝓲𝓮 (@_Crypto_Barbie) September 13, 2025 The Legal Backdrop Beyond cultural references, XRP’s real-world journey has been shaped by a high-stakes legal battle. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission sued Ripple Labs in 2020, alleging that XRP was sold as an unregistered security. After years of courtroom sparring, the case effectively ended in late June 2025. Judge Analisa Torres rejected earlier settlement proposals but ultimately approved the mutual withdrawal of all appeals, closing the chapter on one of the crypto industry’s longest regulatory fights. Ripple confirmed on June 27 that it had dropped its counter-appeal, and the SEC is no longer pursuing its own. This final resolution removed a major cloud over XRP’s future and cleared the way for broader institutional participation. Market Momentum and ETF Prospects With legal uncertainty lifted, attention has shifted to potential exchange-traded funds (ETFs) that could give investors regulated exposure to XRP. Several asset managers are reportedly preparing filings for spot-market products , following the path that Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs have already begun to carve. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Approval of an XRP-linked ETF would represent a major milestone , unlocking new liquidity channels and lending further credibility to the asset that once faced heavy regulatory scrutiny. Culture Meets Capital Amelie’s argument is not that The Simpsons literally predicted XRP’s rise, but that popular culture can foreshadow technological and economic change. The “Frinkcoin” episode captured how innovation and public enthusiasm can collide to create seismic market shifts long before traditional institutions react. XRP’s evolving story—legal vindication, growing institutional interest, and a community attuned to cultural signals—illustrates how narrative and regulation can converge to influence financial reality. Amelie’s post invites readers to view XRP through a wider cultural lens. Whether or not one believes The Simpsons offered a roadmap, the parallels underscore how ideas once dismissed as entertainment can reflect genuine economic trends. With the SEC case closed and ETF speculation building, XRP stands at a pivotal moment where popular narrative and market fundamentals intersect—just as a satirical cartoon imagined years ago.

In his assessment, Wedson pointed out that this level was one of the points where the market tended to slow down or form local peaks in the past. “Any price above $117,000 enters a zone of strong interest and indecision. Therefore, a clear break above $118,000 would be a sign of strength,” Wedson said.

Walker, who reported directly to AI chief John Giannandrea, used to be in charge of Siri until recently. He changed roles earlier this year to lead Apple’s Answers team after a major reshuffling, which some attribute to the challenges Apple was facing with rolling out Apple Intelligence . Oversight of Siri was transferred to software engineering head Craig Federighi after promised improvements to the assistant were delayed. A future release now in question Walker was reportedly moved on to oversee the development of a new AI-powered web search tool similar to products from Perplexity and ChatGPT. The search project is scheduled for release in 2026, but with his impending exit, the timeline for that launch may be called into question. Walker was known internally as a defender of Siri’s long-term potential. In a March internal meeting, he likened Apple’s work on AI to “swimming hundreds of miles” only to be criticized for “not getting to Hawaii,” acknowledging delays but insisting progress was significant. An exodus of AI talent Walker’s exit follows a string of high-profile departures from Apple’s AI division. Ruoming Pang, who led Apple’s AI models team, left for Meta earlier this year, with several engineers and researchers following him. Frank Chu, another senior figure who was working in the search services team, has also moved to Meta. This talent flight has intensified concerns about Apple’s ability to retain top AI talent at a time when rivals, including Google, Meta, and Microsoft, are racing ahead with advanced generative AI products. The defections risk hollowing out Apple’s institutional expertise just as demand for generative AI capabilities in consumer hardware accelerates. The departures come as Apple’s AI strategy faces heat from investors and consumers. The company unveiled its “Apple Intelligence” suite of features earlier this year, integrating large language models into the iPhone and Mac. What’s next for Apple? Critics point out that Siri, launched in 2011, has failed to capitalize on a technology it pioneered more than a decade ago, and now it’s lagging behind in the race for AI leadership. The development of Apple’s own AI-powered search system was welcomed with enthusiasm, especially by its ecosystem, as it was seen as the next major step for the tech giant. Its debut, however, may now be delayed under new leadership. Despite the recent challenges, some investors remain optimistic about Apple’s chances of turning the tide around.

Layer Brett, a next-generation meme coin with real utility, has surpassed $3.5 million in its presale , fusing viral culture with essential blockchain scalability. Layer Brett: New meme coin season Layer Brett stands out by offering a solution to common Ethereum Layer 1 challenges, namely slow transactions and expensive gas fees. Layer Brett processes up to 10,000 transactions per second (TPS)—with gas fees that go down as much as $0.0001. This innovative approach gives $LBRETT a significant edge in a market hungry for efficient, low-cost alternatives. It truly bridges meme power with real speed and utility. Layer Brett aims to disrupt the meme token landscape by offering high-speed, low-cost transactions, significant staking rewards, and a vibrant community ecosystem. $LBRETT operates transactions off-chain to reduce congestion on the mainnet, while still anchoring to Ethereum for security. This mechanism unlocks throughput, compresses fees, and shrinks wait times, enabling near-instant transactions and dramatically reduced gas costs compared to Ethereum’s $10–$20 fees. By leveraging this efficiency, Layer Brett can provide significantly higher staking rewards, ensuring users get more for their efforts. A clear path for XRP XRP is positioned for a big move. The XRP news shows its price has broken out of a long-term symmetrical triangle pattern, signaling that a major accumulation phase is over. With XRP news about new institutional interest and potential for an ETF, a strong rally is imminent ADA’s researched-backed rally Cardano is a unique blockchain focused on security and sustainability, utilizing its peer-reviewed Ouroboros protocol. Its ongoing upgrades are designed to enhance ADA’s performance. When it comes to Cardano price prediction, technical analysis supports a powerful rally for ADA for the rest of 2025. A recent breakout from a multi-year consolidation pattern signals a new uptrend. ADA price is expected to rise significantly as its ecosystem expands. But given the large market cap, ADA will need to push really hard to make any major gains. Layer Brett: sparking meme rally Bringing utility to memes, Layer Brett is set to lead the meme coin rally. DeFi functionality makes $LBRETT larger than life, with potential to outpace other meme giants. The $LBRETT presale is ongoing at $0.0055 per token , offering early entrants a chance to earn more than 700% APY through instant staking. This low entry price, combined with high yields and a $1 million giveaway, attracts significant interest. DeFi functionality is nothing without efficiency, and here is where the ETH Layer 2 steps in. Building off its security, Layer Brett is completely decentralized, and offers anonymity, with no KYC requirements, and governance options. The experts’ verdict: Layer Brett can do 100x in 2026, beating even XRP and the best of ADA. Get it while it’s hot! Layer Brett is still in its presale for $0.0055 , but not for long. Early backers are positioned for significant rewards through staking and dynamic ecosystem incentives. This Layer 2 crypto offers a unique blend of fun and function, distinguishing itself from utility-free origins. Now’s your chance to be part of the Layer Brett movement.

Exxon’s announcement hands a boost to the electric vehicle industry as it becomes a supplier of a new synthetic material capable of solving critical challenges in the industry From oil to EV materials Exxon Mobil Corp. is making a big splash in the electric vehicle (EV) supply industry with the announcement of a synthetic graphite material that it claims can extend EV battery life by up to 30%. The company’s Chief Executive Officer, Darren Woods, unveiled the innovation on Friday at the University of Texas at Austin’s Energy Symposium, describing it as a “revolutionary step change in battery performance.” Exxon said that the new carbon molecule is already being tested by several EV manufacturers. This material could allow for faster charging, longer lifespans, and extended driving ranges in electric vehicles. Exxon intends to secure its supply chain and has already acquired production assets from Chicago-based Superior Graphite earlier this week. The company plans to scale up manufacturing of the material and is aiming for commercial production by 2029. Exxon insists that it does not intend to become a battery maker, but the company sees this as an opportunity to leverage its network of refineries, chemical plants, and research laboratories to support the development of clean energy. “We don’t do wind and solar, we have no issues with wind and solar, but we don’t have capability in that space,” Woods said . “But we do have capability of transforming molecules and there are enormous opportunities in that space to use hydrogen and carbon molecules to meet the growing demand.” The company has hinted at plans to enter the lithium extraction business as well. The company has a history in the industry. It invented the lithium-ion battery in the 1970s, produced the plastic film for the first rechargeable version in 1991, and developed new separator materials for batteries nearly two decades ago. Exxon backtracking on its hydrogen ambitions Exxon’s inclusion of hydrogen as part of its energy transition strategy began around 2018–2021, but the company has had research ties to hydrogen going back at least to the early 2000s. The company has warned that its planned low-carbon hydrogen and ammonia project in Baytown, Texas, may face delays due to weak customer demand. The regulatory environment is also currently a hindrance to the company’s plans. Woods stated that the shortened timeframe for claiming hydrogen tax credits under President Donald Trump’s “ Big Beautiful Bill ” could slow the market’s development. “Our big concern today around low-carbon hydrogen is whether there’s enough time within that bill to incentivize the development of the market,” Woods said. “We can’t do it on charity.” KEY Difference Wire helps crypto brands break through and dominate headlines fast",Tech|Exxon,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|MARKET|REGULATION|RESEARCH|BUSINESS|COMMODITY,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-09-13 20:50:15

The cryptocurrency world is always buzzing with activity, and few events capture attention quite like a substantial movement of digital assets. Recently, the crypto community observed a truly remarkable event: a USDT whale transfer involving a staggering sum. This transaction, valued at approximately $207 million, saw 206,964,406 USDT move from the OKX exchange to an undisclosed wallet address. Such a significant shift often sparks questions and speculation among investors and market watchers alike. What Exactly Happened in This USDT Whale Transfer? Blockchain tracking service Whale Alert was the first to report this massive transaction. The data clearly showed 206,964,406 Tether (USDT) departing from a known OKX wallet. This substantial amount then landed in an address classified as ‘unknown’ – meaning it’s not publicly linked to an exchange or a known institutional entity. A USDT whale transfer refers to the movement of a very large quantity of a stablecoin, in this case, Tether (USDT), by a single entity or group. These entities, often called ‘whales,’ hold enough cryptocurrency to potentially influence market prices. USDT, being a stablecoin pegged to the US dollar, is frequently used for large-scale transfers due to its stability and ease of movement between exchanges. Understanding these transfers is crucial for grasping the underlying currents of the crypto market. While the specifics of the recipient remain a mystery, the sheer volume of this transaction warrants closer examination. Why Do Such Massive USDT Whale Transfers Matter? Large transfers like this USDT whale transfer can have several implications for the broader cryptocurrency ecosystem. Firstly, they can signal a shift in market sentiment. A whale moving funds off an exchange might indicate an intention to hold long-term, suggesting confidence in future price appreciation. Conversely, moving funds to an exchange could precede a large selling order, potentially impacting market prices. Moreover, such transfers affect liquidity. When a significant amount of a stablecoin like USDT moves, it can influence the available liquidity on exchanges, which in turn affects trading pairs and overall market stability. For instance, if the funds are being prepared for a large purchase of another cryptocurrency, it could signal an upcoming upward price movement for that asset. The anonymity of the receiving wallet also adds a layer of intrigue. While blockchain technology provides transparency regarding transactions, the identity behind the wallet address often remains private. This balance between transparency and privacy is a fundamental aspect of the crypto world. Who Could Be Behind This Significant USDT Whale Transfer? Identifying the exact entity behind a large USDT whale transfer is challenging due to the pseudonymous nature of blockchain addresses. However, market analysts often consider several possibilities. It could be an institutional investor making a strategic move, perhaps rebalancing a portfolio or preparing for a major investment in another digital asset. Another common scenario involves exchanges themselves. They often move large sums of crypto between their hot and cold wallets for security reasons or to manage liquidity. While the transaction originated from OKX, the destination being an ‘unknown wallet’ suggests it’s likely not an internal exchange transfer to another of their known addresses. Alternatively, a high-net-worth individual or a large decentralized finance (DeFi) protocol could be behind the move. Regardless of the identity, the scale of this transaction positions the recipient as a significant player in the crypto space, capable of influencing market dynamics. How Should Investors React to a Large USDT Whale Transfer? For everyday investors, observing a large USDT whale transfer should primarily serve as an informational cue rather than an immediate call to action. It is crucial to avoid panic or making impulsive decisions based solely on such news. Instead, consider these actionable insights: Monitor Market Trends: Keep an eye on the overall market sentiment and any subsequent price movements of major cryptocurrencies. Large stablecoin transfers can sometimes precede significant price action. Understand the Context: While a transfer is notable, it’s just one piece of a larger puzzle. Look for other market indicators, news, and analysis to form a comprehensive view. Diversify Your Portfolio: Relying too heavily on one asset or reacting to every large transaction can be risky. A diversified portfolio helps mitigate the impact of individual market events. Conduct Your Own Research: Always verify information and understand the fundamentals of the assets you invest in. Do not solely depend on whale movements as a trading signal. In conclusion, the recent USDT whale transfer from OKX to an unknown wallet is a powerful reminder of the dynamic and often opaque nature of the cryptocurrency market. While the exact motives behind such a colossal move remain shrouded in mystery, it highlights the significant capital flowing within the digital asset space. For investors, it underscores the importance of staying informed, understanding market mechanics, and making well-researched decisions rather than reacting to every large transaction. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) What is a crypto whale? A crypto whale is an individual or entity that holds a very large amount of a particular cryptocurrency. Their substantial holdings mean their transactions can significantly impact market prices and liquidity. What is USDT (Tether)? USDT is a stablecoin, a type of cryptocurrency designed to maintain a stable value, typically pegged to a fiat currency like the US dollar. It’s widely used for trading, lending, and transferring value across the crypto ecosystem due to its stability. Why are large USDT transfers significant? Large USDT transfers are significant because they can indicate major shifts in market sentiment, potential liquidity changes on exchanges, or preparation for large purchases or sales of other cryptocurrencies. They often reflect the actions of major market players. Can the recipient of an unknown wallet transfer be identified? While blockchain transactions are public, the identity behind a wallet address is usually pseudonymous. Unless the wallet owner voluntarily reveals their identity or links it to a regulated entity, identifying them directly from the blockchain is very difficult. Should I change my investment strategy based on a whale transfer? It’s generally not advisable to change your entire investment strategy based on a single whale transfer. While such events are informative, they are just one data point. It’s better to combine this information with broader market analysis, fundamental research, and your personal financial goals.

As the market matures, a growing number of analysts are arguing that Ruvi AI (RUVI) has become a no-brainer investment choice over established utility tokens like Ripple (XRP). With a 100x forecast gaining credibility and daily token sales continuing at a pace of millions, Ruvi AI is rapidly solidifying its position as a project on the verge of a major breakout. This confident outlook is fueled by a presale that is nothing short of sensational. The Ruvi AI presale is rocketing towards the $3.6 million fundraising milestone, a clear signal of immense market conviction. A fast-growing global community of over 3,500 holders has already acquired more than 265 million RUVI tokens . This intense buying pressure, which sees millions of tokens sold daily, indicates that the 100x forecast might be nearing reality sooner than anyone expected. The Clear Advantage: Why Ruvi AI is a No-Brainer for 100x Gains The argument for choosing Ruvi AI over Ripple boils down to one simple factor: exponential growth potential. For Ripple, a 100x return from its current position is a mathematical near-impossibility due to its massive market capitalization. The window for life-changing gains has long since closed. Ruvi AI, however, presents the perfect formula for a 100x run. It combines a low initial market cap with powerful, real-world utility in the booming $104 billion creator economy . Its value is not based on speculation, but on its revolutionary super app designed to solve tangible problems for millions of users. This fundamental strength is what underpins its 100x potential and has been further validated by a successful smart contract audit from CyberScope and a prominent listing on CoinMarketCap . The Super App Fueling the Breakout The engine driving Ruvi AI’s unstoppable momentum is its game-changing super app. This all-in-one platform is set to become an essential tool for content creators, building a foundation for mass adoption that could send its token value soaring. Its integrated features include: Advanced Trend Research: Helps creators identify viral topics before they become saturated, providing a significant competitive advantage. AI-Powered Script Generation: Creates engaging, platform-optimized scripts for YouTube, TikTok, and Instagram in seconds. Native Media Creation: Generates professional-quality images and videos directly within the app, streamlining content production. Streamlined Workflows: Centralizes the entire creative process for maximum efficiency. Urgent Alert: A 40% Price Surge Is Guaranteed The presale is currently in Phase 3 , with the RUVI token available at an attractive $0.020 . But with millions of tokens selling daily, this ground-floor price is disappearing fast. According to the project’s official tokenomics, the start of Phase 4 will trigger an automatic and guaranteed 40% price increase to $0.028 . This imminent price jump is creating intense FOMO as investors rush to lock in a guaranteed paper gain. Strategic Partnership and High-Reward VIP Tiers Ruvi AI’s journey towards a potential 100x return is further amplified by a strategic partnership with WEEX , a major cryptocurrency exchange. This collaboration will ensure deep liquidity and a seamless trading experience upon launch, paving the way for rapid price discovery and broad market adoption. For investors aiming to turn the 100x forecast into reality, the project’s VIP program offers a clear path: VIP 5 ($10,000 investment): Unlock 1,000,000 tokens with a 100% bonus (500,000 additional tokens). At a $1 valuation, this reaches $1,000,000, achieving a 9,900% ROI . VIP 3 ($2,000 investment): Secure 160,000 tokens with a 60% bonus (60,000 additional tokens). At a $1 valuation, this totals $160,000, delivering a 7,900% ROI . VIP 2 ($1,000 investment): Receive 70,000 tokens with a 40% bonus (20,000 additional tokens). At a $1 valuation, this equals $70,000, resulting in a 6,900% ROI . A competitive leaderboard giveaway also rewards top supporters, fostering a vibrant and engaged community that adds to the project’s unstoppable momentum. The Time to Act is Now As the presale accelerates and a guaranteed price increase looms, it’s clear why Ruvi AI is being called a no-brainer. For investors looking to move beyond the limited upside of established tokens and into a project with a clear path to 100x returns, the opportunity is here and now.

NVT Reading Suggests So",https://www.newsbtc.com/news/ethereum/is-ethereum-undervalued-nvt-reading-suggests-so/,"The latest on-chain data shows that the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, Ethereum, may be currently undervalued. Having witnessed a strong resurgence in the past week, the altcoin could be on the verge of an extended rally over the next few weeks. Ethereum’s NVT Ratio Hits New Record Low In a Quicktake post on the CryptoQuant platform, crypto analyst CryptoOnchain reported that there has been a disproportionate increase in transaction volume concerning ETH compared to its market capitalization. The relevant indicator here is the Ethereum NVT (Network Value to Transactions ratio) (30-day SMA), which measures the ratio of Ethereum’s market capitalization to its daily transaction volume over the span of 30 days. Related Reading: XRP Exchange Reserves Balloon 1.2 Billion In One Day, Why This Is Bearish For Price CryptoOnchain revealed that the 30-day moving average NVT recently hit its lowest point ever recorded. As explained by the on-chain analyst, this could suggest two things: firstly, that the Ethereum token is undervalued. For context, a low NVT reflects very high transaction volume compared to a relatively low market capitalization. What this means is that the Ethereum network is being heavily used, but the price isn’t showing its worth as much as its usage suggests. Following this logic, one could conclude the market is currently undervaluing Ethereum’s utility. The second indication from the historically low NVT is that the increase in transaction volume could be due to “temporary factors such as DeFi, NFT events, or large capital movements.” According to the analyst, these temporary factors do not necessarily mean sustainable growth for the ETH price. What To Expect CryptoOnchain cited historical occurrences to explain the typical case where an NVT bottom is a result of market undervaluation. In this case, it has been observed that sharp NVT bottoms precede bullish phases. However, in what was a caveat, the online pundit mentioned that there have been cases where very low NVT levels were accompanied by further price declines. Seeing that the Ethereum NVT is not just at a mere low level, but at its all-time low, it seems more likely that the market is undervaluing the token’s worth. It is therefore not out of the question to expect a more upward swing in the price of the cryptocurrency. Related Reading: Ethereum To $6,800 By Year End? CME Futures Data Shows Record Institutional Demand Nevertheless, with the possibility that a bullish phase might not necessarily follow in mind, investors might want to tread cautiously. As of this writing, the Ethereum token is valued at approximately $4,670, reflecting an over 4% price increase in the past 24 hours.

Once dismissed as speculative novelties, today’s meme-driven tokens have matured into cultural and financial movements with real communities and unique tokenomics. At the center of this transformation are the top meme coin presales in 2025, projects that combine narrative strength with structured tokenomics to appeal to both retail traders and analysts. Among these, top meme coin presales in 2025 like BullZilla ($BZIL) , Dogecoin, and Cat in a Dog’s World are leading the charge. They are not just attracting hype but also presenting frameworks that align with long-term sustainability. For investors seeking the top meme coin presales in 2025, these projects provide a window into how speculative assets can evolve into structured ecosystems with exponential growth potential. BullZilla: The Mutation Presale That Redefines Tokenomics BullZilla presale sits in its second stage, aptly named “Dead Wallets Don’t Lie”, with the token priced at $0.00005241. Over $370,000 has been raised and more than 1,300 holders have already secured their positions. This momentum is not accidental; it is rooted in BullZilla’s Zilla DNA, a tokenomic structure designed to balance scarcity, growth, and long-term sustainability. Zilla DNA: Tokenomics That Drive the Ecosystem BullZilla has a total supply of 160 billion tokens, distributed strategically across five categories that serve different functions within the ecosystem: Presale Engine (50% – 80 billion tokens): This allocation ensures community engagement at the earliest stages, powering the progressive presale model that raises both capital and awareness. HODL Furnace Staking (20% – 32 billion tokens): Designed to reward long-term holders with APYs up to 70%, this mechanism incentivizes loyalty while reducing volatility by locking tokens away. Treasury and Ecosystem (20% – 32 billion tokens): Reserved for development, marketing, and operational stability to ensure BullZilla evolves beyond its initial presale stage. Burn Pool Reserve (5% – 8 billion tokens): The Roar Burn Mechanism periodically destroys tokens, reducing supply and tightening market dynamics as new chapters in BullZilla’s lore unfold. Team Allocation (5% – 8 billion tokens): Locked for two years, aligning the team’s rewards with the project’s long-term success. This structure ensures a balance between immediate liquidity, future growth, and deflationary pressure. Unlike earlier meme coins that launched without clear frameworks, BullZilla’s presale blueprint mirrors professional tokenomic models outlined in academic research on deflationary cryptocurrencies (see studies from MIT’s Digital Currency Initiative). The Mutation Mechanism: Dynamic Pricing in Action What truly sets BullZilla apart is its progressive pricing engine. The cost of each token increases every time $100,000 is raised or every 48 hours, whichever comes first. This mechanism ensures a continuous upward trajectory, rewarding early adopters and creating a self-sustaining cycle of demand. Reports from Messari highlight how progressive presales reduce the risk of price collapse by aligning token price growth with demand dynamics. BullZilla applies this principle at scale, making it one of the best crypto to buy today for investors who understand the mathematics of scarcity. How to Buy BullZilla Coins For those looking to join, the process is streamlined and accessible even for newcomers to crypto. Set Up a Wallet: Install a Web3 wallet such as MetaMask or Trust Wallet. Buy Ethereum (ETH): Acquire ETH via exchanges like Binance or Coinbase and transfer it to your wallet. Visit the Presale Site: Connect your wallet directly to the official BullZilla presale portal. Swap ETH for $BZIL: Enter the amount you wish to purchase, confirm the transaction, and your allocation is secured. Each purchase contributes to the presale tally, pushing the price higher and reinforcing the narrative of momentum. Investment Scenario: $1,000 in BullZilla Presale Price: $0.00005241 Tokens Purchased: 19,081,376 $BZIL Value at $0.01: $190,813 Value at $0.10: $1.9 million This projection highlights the exponential ROI potential if Bull Zilla reaches benchmarks achieved by earlier meme coins like Shiba Inu. It is speculative yet grounded in historical precedent, with Shiba’s 2021 surge serving as a comparative case study documented by Chainalysis. Dogecoin: The Original Meme Coin That Started It All Dogecoin (DOGE) began in 2013 as a lighthearted meme coin inspired by the Shiba Inu dog meme, but it quickly grew into one of the most recognizable names in cryptocurrency. Originally created by Billy Markus and Jackson Palmer, Dogecoin was designed to be a fun, community-driven digital currency. It runs on its own blockchain, using Proof-of-Work mining similar to Bitcoin, but with faster block times and virtually unlimited supply. This makes DOGE well-suited for microtransactions, tipping online creators, and charitable campaigns, which became core aspects of its early adoption. Over time, Dogecoin’s strong and passionate community, coupled with endorsements from public figures like Elon Musk, pushed it into mainstream recognition. Despite its origins as a joke, Dogecoin has proven resilient and remains one of the largest cryptocurrencies by market cap. Its accessibility, low transaction costs, and vibrant culture make it a favorite for both newcomers and seasoned investors. While it doesn’t have the scarcity of Bitcoin, Dogecoin thrives on community strength and remains a cultural phenomenon in the crypto world. Cat in a Dog’s World: The Feline Challenger to Doge Dominance Cat in a Dog’s World (ticker: MEW) is a newer meme coin project that flips the narrative of meme dominance by positioning cats as rivals to the “dog coin” trend. Built as a playful but strategic counter to Dogecoin and Shiba Inu, MEW taps into internet culture’s love for cats while aiming to build a serious ecosystem around the meme. It exists primarily on Solana, benefiting from low transaction fees, high scalability, and fast transfers, which makes it an attractive alternative for users tired of congestion on older blockchains. The project isn’t just about the joke—it also emphasizes community, gamification, and utility. Holders of MEW participate in social campaigns, NFTs, and staking opportunities designed to expand the token’s ecosystem. With its unique branding, strong meme identity, and rapid community adoption, Cat in a Dog’s World seeks to capture the next wave of meme coin enthusiasm. Positioned as both a cultural statement and a practical Solana-based asset, MEW is quickly carving out a space in a market long dominated by “dog coins.” Conclusion The top meme coin presales in 2025 are redefining how investors look at meme-driven projects. BullZilla leads with its progressive presale mechanism, already raising o ver $370k in s tage two, while Dogecoin thrives on viral culture and Cat in a Dog’s World bridges NFTs with tokenized liquidity. Together, these tokens form a new class of speculative yet structured opportunities. For those analyzing the top meme coin presales in 2025, it becomes clear that projects with strong tokenomics and community alignment stand apart from fleeting market trends. BullZilla, with its Mutation Presale and deflationary mechanics, emerges as the strongest contender. Anyone watching the top meme coin presales in 2025 can see that the market is evolving from memes into movements, creating opportunities that could shape the next generation of crypto wealth.

This imbalance already leaves the U.S. with a 7% budget deficit even without a downturn . The problem becomes explosive once recession dynamics kick in. When the economy contracts, government revenue typically drops around 20%. That would cut today’s $5 trillion revenue base down to roughly $3.9 trillion. At the same time, automatic programs like unemployment benefits and discretionary stimulus push spending higher—potentially from $7.1 trillion to over $9 trillion. Combined, this means a deficit of $5+ trillion, or nearly 18% of GDP , a level unseen in U.S. history. The real danger is how debt interacts with growth. In the 1980s, each new dollar of debt produced $3 of GDP. Now, it generates just $0.37, and the return keeps falling. Piling trillions in new debt during a recession could choke growth further, while rising borrowing needs might drive bond yields and interest costs sharply higher . Every 1% rise in yields would add another $370 billion in annual interest, pushing deficits closer to $7 trillion. This creates a vicious cycle: falling GDP, collapsing tax revenue, soaring spending, and rising borrowing costs. If markets lose faith in U.S. debt, the dollar could weaken and the Federal Reserve may be forced to step in with massive money-printing—risking inflation and financial instability on a global scale.",,EN,0,0,MACROECONOMICS|BUSINESS|REGULATION|FIAT|MARKET,"{'name': 'Coinpaprika', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/80/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaprika,2025-09-13 21:38:46

Pi Network, the mobile friendly mining blockchain, is showing signs of weakening. PI holders are still waiting on a proper mainnet, and with a massive token lock-up end impending, PI has a high probability of making a serious dip. But there’s a strong case to be made for Layer Brett ($LBRETT), Cronos (CRO), and Solana (SOL) as the best cryptos to invest in right now. What are the reasons for experts backing CRO, SOL, and the upcoming meme leader $LBRETT ? Layer Brett: Filling The Demand for Scalability The crypto market increasingly seeks solutions for network congestion and high transaction fees. Ethereum Layer 2s are critical, driven by demands for faster transactions and dramatically lower gas fees. Many altcoins and DeFi coins struggle with Layer 1 limitations. Layer Brett steps into this burgeoning market, offering a next-generation Layer 2 blockchain built for efficiency. Layer Brett fuses viral culture with substantial blockchain utility. It enables lightning-fast transactions (10,000 TPS) and low gas fees ($0.0001). This architecture helps it escape Ethereum Layer 1’s typical congestion and high costs. $LBRETT is purpose-built for performance and user rewards, offering early staking benefits and an evolving ecosystem that promises full Layer 2 functionality. Early buyers of Layer Brett presale (currently at $0.0055) benefit from enhanced staking rates (over 700% APY, but falling), and its fixed supply of 10 billion tokens underscores a community-focused approach. This ecosystem includes gamified staking, NFT integrations, and a planned $1 million giveaway. What a future! PI: A Mobile Crypto with a Mixed Outlook Pi Network is a mobile-first project that lets anyone “mine” crypto from their phone. While it has a massive community, its price outlook for the rest of 2025 is mixed, with some analysts noting a bearish sentiment. The token has been trading sideways, with key technicals like the RSI remaining neutral-to-bearish. Any major upward move would require a significant catalyst like new exchange listings or a major increase in its utility, which PI seems not to do much about lately. Cronos (CRO): The Exchange’s Powerhouse CRO is a blockchain designed to connect different crypto networks, making it a key player in the “Internet of Blockchains.” With major partnerships and strategic upgrades, it is building a powerful ecosystem for DeFi, NFTs, and payments. CRO is poised for a significant bullish breakout in the rest of 2025. A recent breakout from a multi-year consolidation pattern and a bullish MACD crossover back this. The network’s new partnerships, particularly with Trump Media, and a potential U.S. ETF approval are expected to act as major catalysts, fueling a rally toward previous all-time highs and beyond. SOL’s Next Chapter Solana is the high-speed, low-cost “Ethereum Killer” that’s now a major player in its own right, powering everything from decentralized finance to major gaming projects. Its ongoing upgrades, including the Firedancer validator client, are set to further boost its performance and stability. Technical analysis points to a confirmed breakout from a long-term symmetrical triangle and a decisive golden cross on its moving averages. This is supported by surging on-chain activity and growing institutional interest, which could fuel a parabolic rally toward new highs, pushing SOL to new highs. Layer Brett: Your Best Crypto to Invest In? While SOL and CRO are set to boom in the rest of 2025, the crown of the best crypto to invest in goes to Layer Brett. Its meme/utility combo, enigmatic presale , and massive rewards put it ahead of the pack.

Cardano’s Current Momentum Cardano (ADA) is currently priced at $0.8858, and its price has been ranging from $0.8724 to $0.8934 today. Despite attempts to push through $1, ADA has faced resistance in the $0.90–$0.95 range, and volumes suggest that buyers are not yet aggressively enough to push past sellers there. Without some catalyst, i.e., major news, partnership, or institutional investment, ADA may simply drift sideways or pull back a bit before trying again. Meanwhile, newest DeFi projects such as Mutuum Finance are picking up steam on the fringes. Mutuum Finance (MUTM): Presale Phase 6 Mutuum Finance is currently in phase six of presale and in this phase, the tokens are priced at $0.035 with an increase of 16.17% from the last phase. There’s huge demand in the market as the project has already drawn more than 16,240 investors and topped $15.63 million. Apart from enhancing CertiK’s security capabilities, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has also introduced a Bug Bounty Program with a total prize of 50,000 USDT for the security of the platform. The bugs are categorized into four levels on the basis of the name critical, major, minor, and low. Mutuum Finance collateralization has a limit by asset and differs based on the type of risk an asset would impose. It contains supply capping, borrowing and collateral capping. The protocol is hedging market risk through overcollateralizing positions. The protocol incentivizes the liquidators as well for closing the trades that are undercollateralized and thus risky positions are closed in real time. The collateral use is maintained low for riskier tokens here but the highly correlated tokens are used to their maximum so that they may be able to get the most out of their collateral. All these are used for insolvency risk avoidance in such a manner that no form of imbalance is generated in lending and borrowing within the protocol. User Community and Growth Development Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is looking to expand an active user base with an grassroots campaign of organizing a $100,000 giveaway . Ten users will receive $10,000 MUTM tokens each as part of the campaign for encouraging investments on the protocol. Security Framework and Back-up Plan Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is an LTV construct with risk-of-assets contingent one with subjective collateral, transfer and liquidation lending but risk-of-assets contingent. It also contains a reserve factor as back-up and very bad market condition buffer. Risk assets are reserved higher in an effort to provide higher security to the protocol and users. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is gaining investor interest as Cardano (ADA) struggles to break $1. Stage 6 presale tokens are at $0.035, a 16.17% premium already from the last round, with more than 16,240 investors putting in $15.63M. Backed by a $50K CertiK bug bounty, $100K giveaway, and robust overcollateralization risk mitigants, MUTM earns respect while pushing lightning adoption. ADA continues to bounce at resistance levels of $0.90–$0.95, but Mutuum momentum increases mounting DeFi adoption. Lock in your Stage 6 tokens before they move up to $0.04 on the next stage.

Right now, a powerful new project, Ruvi AI (RUVI), is demonstrating a level of presale velocity that has analysts buzzing. With Phase 3 of its presale already nearing the 10% sold mark just days after launch, experts suggest Ruvi AI has the momentum to challenge even a top-10 giant like Cardano (ADA) for a spot in the charts. This isn’t just speculation; it’s backed by explosive presale numbers. Ruvi AI is rapidly closing in on the $3.6 million milestone, having sold over 265 million tokens to a fast-growing community of more than 3,500 investors . This tidal wave of support signals that the market sees Ruvi AI not just as another altcoin, but as a potential market leader. A Strategic Challenge to the Old Guard The comparison to Cardano is about potential and timing. Cardano is a mature, respected project, but its massive market cap means its days of exponential growth are likely behind it. Ruvi AI, however, offers the ground-floor entry point and explosive growth potential that early Cardano investors once enjoyed. It represents a strategic pivot for investors looking for the next 100x opportunity. Ruvi AI’s credibility is a major factor in its rapid ascent. The project has proactively built investor trust by completing a comprehensive smart contract audit with CyberScope , a reputable third-party security firm. This commitment to security, combined with a high-profile listing on CoinMarketCap , has established Ruvi AI as a legitimate, high-growth project worthy of serious capital. A Super App to Revolutionize a $104 Billion Industry The engine driving Ruvi AI’s challenge to the top charts is its revolutionary super app. This all-in-one ecosystem is built to empower content creators in the booming $104 billion creator economy . By solving real-world problems, Ruvi AI is creating sustainable, long-term demand for its token. The app’s integrated AI-powered tools include: Advanced Trend Research: Identifies viral topics before they saturate the market, giving creators a competitive edge. AI-Powered Script Generation: Creates engaging, platform-optimized scripts for YouTube, TikTok, and Instagram, saving valuable time. Native Media Creation: Allows users to generate professional-quality images and videos directly within the app, reducing production costs. Streamlined Workflows: Centralizes the entire content creation process, from planning to scheduling, to maximize productivity. Final Call: A Guaranteed 40% Price Surge Is Imminent The presale is currently in Phase 3 , with the RUVI token priced at an attractive $0.020 . However, with 10% of this phase selling out in mere days, this opportunity is closing fast. The start of Phase 4 will trigger an automatic and guaranteed 40% price increase to $0.028 . This imminent price jump is creating intense FOMO, driving record sales as investors rush to lock in an immediate paper gain. Strategic Partnership and High-Reward VIP Tiers Amplifying its growth trajectory is a strategic partnership with WEEX , a major cryptocurrency exchange. This collaboration will ensure deep liquidity and a seamless trading experience at launch, paving the way for rapid price discovery and broad market adoption. For those aiming to maximize their returns, the project’s VIP program offers a clear path to significant wealth: VIP 5 ($10,000 investment): Unlock 1,000,000 tokens with a 100% bonus (500,000 additional tokens). At a $1 valuation, this reaches $1,000,000, achieving a 9,900% ROI . VIP 3 ($2,000 investment): Secure 160,000 tokens with a 60% bonus (60,000 additional tokens). At a $1 valuation, this totals $160,000, delivering a 7,900% ROI . VIP 2 ($1,000 investment): Receive 70,000 tokens with a 40% bonus (20,000 additional tokens). At a $1 valuation, this equals $70,000, resulting in a 6,900% ROI . A competitive leaderboard giveaway also rewards top supporters, fostering a vibrant and engaged community that adds to the project’s unstoppable momentum. A New Titan Is Rising As Ruvi AI’s presale accelerates toward a sell-out and a 40% price surge looms, its potential to challenge the crypto elite becomes clearer every day. For investors who feel they missed the boat on Cardano, this is a rare second chance to get in on the ground floor of what could be this cycle’s biggest star.

After ending August and starting September below the psychological $110,000 level, the premier cryptocurrency returned to above $115,000. While the Bitcoin price has somewhat slowed down heading into the weekend, optimism is growing around the market about the possibility of a fresh rally. Interestingly, the latest on-chain data points to the increased possibility of a “momentum-driven rally” for the Bitcoin price. Binance Taker Buy Sell Ratio Remains Positive For 3 Days In a September 12 post on the X platform, crypto analyst Burak Kesmeci shared an exciting on-chain perspective to support the growing bullish narrative around the Bitcoin price. According to the online pundit, the Taker Buy Sell Ratio on the world’s largest crypto exchange, Binance, has persisted in the positive territory for three days. The Taker Buy Sell Ratio is an on-chain metric that compares the proportion of the taker buy volumes to the taker sell volumes on crypto exchanges. A greater-than-one value of this metric usually implies that the taker buy volume is higher than the taker sell volume on an exchange (Binance, in this case). This trend suggests that more traders are willing to acquire coins at a higher value on the trading platform. On the other hand, when the Taker Buy Sell ratio is below 1, it indicates that the taker sell volume is greater than the taker buy volume in the exchange. Ultimately, this value suggests that more sellers are willing to sell coins at a lower price in the open market. According to CryptoQuant data provided by Kesmeci, the Binance Taker Buy Sell ratio has been above the 1 threshold over the past three days. This metric, sitting around 1.04, suggests a growing bullish momentum and rising investor confidence in the market. What’s more, the metric’s local peaks are around 1.15 in 2025, meaning that the investor sentiment is not overheated yet and could see further rise from its current point. In this case, Kesmeci concluded that the positive investor sentiment on the world’s largest crypto exchange by trading volume could set the stage for a momentum-driven uptrend for the Bitcoin price. Bitcoin Price At A Glance As of this writing, the price of BTC stands at around $115,900, reflecting no significant movement in the past 24 hours.",Bitcoin|bitcoin|bitcoin price|btc|BTC news|btc price|BTCUSDT,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|TRADING|BTC|EXCHANGE|BUSINESS,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-09-13 22:00:46

Here’s What This Means For Viral Crypto Assets Like Remittix",https://www.cryptopolitan.com/doge-etf-approved-heres-what-this-means-for-viral-crypto-assets-like-remittix/,"Dogecoin just got a huge boost with the first DOGE ETF greenlight in the United States and traders are watching the next big move. Many expect a test of the $0.30 level soon and a break above it could spark a stronger rally. This matters for every Dogecoin price prediction on the table right now. At the same time, PayFi altcoin Remittix (RTX) is grabbing attention with a 15% USDT referral reward that pays out daily through its dashboard. Utility plus rewards makes Remittix one to watch in 2025. Dogecoin Price Prediction After ETF Approval The new Rex-Osprey Doge ETF, ticker DOJE, will trade under the Investment Company Act of 1940 framework. Analysts like Bloomberg’s Eric Balchunas say the product offers traditional investors exposure to the meme coin through regulated markets. This is a turning point for DOGE because, until now, one of the biggest criticisms was the lack of serious demand drivers. Market experts now see a higher probability of Dogecoin moving toward $0.30 from its current price of $0.264, in the short term, with prediction markets giving a 66.6% chance of this outcome. A push beyond that level could ignite stronger rallies, with $0.40–$0.50 in view if ETF inflows mirror the enthusiasm seen with Bitcoin. For now, the most common Dogecoin price prediction is that $0.30 will act as the next critical test. What This Means For Other Viral Altcoins Like Remittix While Dogecoin is enjoying renewed attention, another crypto asset is quickly gaining ground. Remittix has raised more than $25,4 million, sold over 660 million tokens and is currently priced at $0.1080. The project has already confirmed listings on BitMart and LBANK, with a third exchange on the way. A wallet beta is set to launch in September, further building momentum for the token’s rollout. Remittix is solving a $19 trillion payments problem through PayFi infrastructure Users can send crypto to bank accounts in more than 30 countries Global payout rails are already active and expanding rapidly The project is audited by CertiK, ensuring trust and transparency The 15% referral program in USDT makes adoption faster and more rewarding Final Thoughts Dogecoin’s first U.S. ETF approval is rewriting its narrative, giving investors new confidence and lifting Dogecoin price prediction targets. But at the same time, Remittix is offering something different: not just hype but utility and incentives that reward growth. For investors looking at viral crypto assets in 2025, DOGE may keep its crown as the original meme coin but Remittix is emerging as the PayFi contender that could rival its momentum.

However, Austin Hilton, a popular crypto commentator, has declared that investors are not bullish enough on XRP, while also admitting that he too had underestimated the token’s true potential. His latest outlook is that XRP’s price upside is far greater than most expect, and this realization comes from examining where Bitcoin could be in the coming years. Related Reading: ETF Dreams For Dogecoin: Serious Possibility Or Just Hype? Bitcoin’s Billion-Dollar Forecast And What It Means For XRP XRP price predictions have mostly always been anchored on discussions and expectations of adoption by banks in cross-border settlement. However, according to Austin Hilton, all these catalysts could be left aside, and XRP’s price could surge massively in the years ahead, especially if Bitcoin fulfills lofty projections. According to the pundit, the scale of the crypto opportunity in the coming decades is so immense that current investors are not bullish enough and accumulating enough XRP. He referenced a circulating forecast that predicted that Bitcoin could reach as high as $1 billion per coin by 2038, a figure championed by high-profile names such as Michael Saylor. This prediction stunned him, as the highest long-term projections he had seen had put the Bitcoin price at $13 million. Bringing the conversation back to XRP, he noted that if this projected Bitcoin rally pushes the entire market upward, as it has always done, then XRP’s value could rise even more in relative terms. Therefore, XRP has the room to act as a multiplier in comparison to Bitcoin’s moves because of its smaller market cap. The Roadmap To Double And Triple-Digit XRP As noted by Hilton, the $1 billion projection is very speculative, adding that “that absolutely floored me and blew me away.” However, the analyst also pointed out that even shorter-term moves in Bitcoin could have an outsized impact on XRP. For instance, he predicted that the XRP price will surge to between $15 and $20 if Bitcoin were to reach $200,000 by the end of the year. Furthermore, he added that XRP’s price could realistically climb to triple digits if Bitcoin advances to the $1 million price level in the coming years. In this case, the analyst estimated a potential of at least $100 per coin. Interestingly, these price targets do not even account for catalysts within XRP’s own ecosystem, such as Ripple’s cross-border payment network, acquisitions, and growing adoption among banks. XRP’s upside could be even greater when these factors are factored in. Related Reading: Dogecoin Defies Odds, Jumps 21% Even As ETF Debut Gets Pushed Back The pundit’s bottom line was that XRP holders need to raise their level of conviction. Bitcoin currently makes up around 60% of the entire crypto market, meaning that any explosive growth in its value is almost certain to lift other large market cap cryptocurrencies. XRP has a smaller cap than Bitcoin, so it could post even stronger relative gains in such an environment. At the time of writing, XRP is trading at $3.14, up by 2.9% in the past 24 hours.

Here’s Why,https://timestabloid.com/many-xrp-millionaires-will-be-born-in-october-heres-why/,"Growing optimism within the XRP community suggests that October could be a turning point for investors, with many speculating that substantial wealth could be generated in the coming month. The conversation is largely centered on the potential approval of several spot XRP exchange-traded funds (ETFs) by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Crypto commentator Kenny Nguyen recently argued that “many XRP millionaires will be born in October,” citing the likelihood of spot ETFs being approved and launched within the month. His view mirrors sentiments expressed by other figures in the community, including the influencer CryptoBull, who predicted that September may remain uneventful, but October could mark a decisive shift for XRP. MANY XRP MILLIONAIRES WILL BE BORN IN OCTOBER AFTER THE SPOT XRP ETFS APPROVAL & KICKED IN — Kenny Nguyen (@mrnguyen007) September 7, 2025 ETF Deadlines Approaching The SEC is expected to deliver rulings on multiple XRP ETF applications between October 18 and 25. At least eight major issuers, such as Grayscale, Franklin Templeton, WisdomTree, Bitwise, 21Shares, ProShares, Canary Capital, and CoinShares, are awaiting decisions. Grayscale is positioned at the forefront, with a deadline of October 18 for its application to convert its $500 million XRP Trust into a spot ETF. Analysts suggest that overall inflows from approved products could reach $8 billion during the first year, with Grayscale and Franklin Templeton potentially accounting for $1 billion each. According to Bloomberg Intelligence, the probability of approval before year-end stands at 90–95%, supported by Ripple’s favorable legal outcome against the SEC and the agency’s broader shift toward approving crypto-based investment vehicles. Should approval occur, trading could begin within 24 to 48 hours, similar to the rapid rollout of Bitcoin spot ETFs earlier this year. Market Analysts Expect Breakout Potential Oliver Michel, CEO of Tokentus Investment AG, recently shared his perspective from the Frankfurt Stock Exchange, stressing that while Bitcoin remains important, altcoins such as XRP offer greater growth potential. He projected that leading altcoins could see gains of up to 300%, far surpassing Bitcoin’s more conservative upside. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Currently trading near $3.14, XRP has been consolidating, awaiting a decisive market trigger. Michel emphasized that ETF approval could serve as the catalyst, replicating the sharp market reaction observed after Bitcoin ETF approvals. The derivatives market is already signaling heightened interest. CME Group’s XRP futures surpassed $1 billion in open interest within just three months, while futures-based XRP ETFs now hold more than $800 million in assets. Analysts believe the introduction of spot ETFs could attract significant institutional capital, accelerating upward momentum. Who Stands to Benefit Most? While community forecasts vary, with some expecting XRP to reach $10 before year-end and others predicting $30 by 2026, the possibility of rapid gains has intensified discussion around potential “XRP millionaires.” Wealth creation will likely depend on existing holdings. For example, investors with approximately 100,000 XRP, valued at around $300,000 at current prices, would cross the $1 million mark if XRP were to hit $10 in October. Data from the XRP Rich List indicates that only 34,839 accounts hold at least 95,000 XRP, while more than 5.5 million wallets contain between 20 and 500 tokens. This distribution suggests that while many retail investors may benefit from price increases, only a relatively small group of holders possesses enough tokens to reach millionaire status in the near term.

Ripple’s European expansion, including its custody partnership with BBVA, has given investors renewed confidence. But while XRP is regaining momentum, many traders are eyeing Remittix , the PayFi altcoin that has raised more than $25,4 million through the sale of 660 million tokens at $0.1080 each. Analysts argue this new project could outpace Ripple’s growth with faster real-world adoption. XRP Price Prediction Builds On Breakout Source: TradingView XRP has cleared a key descending trendline that held it down since mid-July. Price action now sits above the $2.94–$2.99 EMA cluster, with both the 20- and 50-period moving averages supporting the trend. Analysts point to the next significant test, which is at $3.10 with heavy resistance as the boundary between the channels. Any breakout above $3.10 will push XRP to $3.25 and later to $3.50, continuing the recovery phase. Nonetheless, a drop below $3.00 would take the market to a position below $2.75, which has been defended several times by bulls. While Ripple’s strong regulatory framework in Europe has boosted sentiment, its ability to sustain momentum is still under question, keeping investors cautious despite positive XRP price prediction targets. Why Remittix Could Outpace Ripple Remittix is capturing attention because it offers something XRP no longer does: fresh exponential growth potential. As a PayFi project, Remittix is building rails for instant cross-border payments with support for 40+ cryptos and 30+ fiat currencies. On top of that, its new 15% USDT referral rewards program allows holders to claim stable payouts every 24 hours, boosting adoption by incentivizing growth. With institutional-level audits and a beta Web3 wallet launch coming this September, experts are calling it the best crypto to buy now for anyone seeking a 20–30x return. Key Drivers Behind Remittix’s Rise Over $25,4M raised with momentum accelerating daily 15% referral rewards in USDT, claimable every 24 hours Beta Web3 wallet launching in September with real FX conversion Backed by a full CertiK audit for investor security Growing PayFi ecosystem designed for businesses, freelancers and remitters Which Token Will Reach $5 First? While XRP price prediction models suggest Ripple could hit $5 in 2025, Remittix is already being tipped as the breakout contender to get there first. With fresh capital inflows, a referral-driven adoption model and cutting-edge PayFi solutions, Remittix is emerging as more than just another altcoin; it is positioning itself as the best crypto to buy now.

Here’s Why,https://timestabloid.com/expert-says-shiba-inu-shib-is-poised-for-600-surge-heres-why/,"Shiba Inu (SHIB) continues to attract divided opinions within the cryptocurrency community. While a section of investors believes the token has failed to meet expectations this year, one prominent analyst argues that the asset could still record substantial growth, projecting a possible sixfold increase from its current value. The broader mood among retail participants has been cautious, as SHIB has struggled to deliver on earlier bullish forecasts. The token has fallen roughly 32% since the start of the year, spending much of 2025 near the $0.00001 range. For many investors who expected Shiba Inu to challenge or exceed $0.00008 this year, the prolonged stagnation has raised doubts about its long-term potential. Technical Outlook Suggests Upside Potential Despite these concerns, market analyst Javon Marks has consistently maintained that Shiba Inu retains the capacity for a significant rally. Marks has been pointing to $0.000081 as his target for several months, a level that would represent close to 6x growth from current prices. There's a reason we're maintaining our $0.000081 target in $SHIB (Shiba Inu)! The technicals are pointing towards a near 6X happening in price to reach it despite what some are saying… https://t.co/ql6k8t7TJM pic.twitter.com/FOWjZleH95 — JAVON MARKS (@JavonTM1) September 12, 2025 In a recent analysis, he noted that SHIB’s price structure remains technically aligned with this projection. His accompanying chart highlighted a breakout from long-standing resistance zones, which he interprets as a signal of improving momentum. Historical data, according to Marks, shows that Shiba Inu often consolidates before advancing sharply, and current conditions appear to mirror that pattern. Marks emphasized that while sentiment in the market has become increasingly skeptical, the underlying technical indicators support the possibility of a sustained rally. He has argued that the ongoing consolidation phase may be setting the foundation for a broader uptrend toward the $0.000081 threshold. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Recent Market Activity and Price Levels Alongside Marks’ outlook, SHIB has shown modest signs of recovery in recent trading sessions. Earlier today, the token surpassed $0.000014, marking its highest level since mid-August. The upward move coincided with broader strength across the cryptocurrency sector, with major assets such as Bitcoin and Ethereum also recording gains. Shiba Inu’s short-term performance reflects this renewed momentum. Over the last 24 hours, the token climbed by 8.76%, extending its weekly growth to 18.28% and an 11.34% increase over the past 30 days. As of publication, SHIB is priced at $0.00001440, giving the asset a market capitalization of approximately $8.51 billion. While this represents an improvement from earlier levels, it is still far below the highs that many investors anticipated when the year began. Market Sentiment Remains Divided The debate over SHIB’s future trajectory underscores a widening gap between technical analysis and investor sentiment. For some community members, the token’s year-to-date losses overshadow its recent progress. Others, including Marks, argue that the technical setup indicates significant potential despite the current climate of doubt. However, the asset’s ability to reclaim resistance levels and attract renewed market attention suggests that it remains firmly in focus among both traders and long-term holders.

51681815,580628,1757808033,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/51681815.jpeg,Pundit Reveals Where Bitcoin’s True Strength Lies – Here’s What It Is,https://bitcoinist.com/where-bitcoins-true-strength-lies/,"Bitcoin’s greatness isn’t measured only by its price or market cycles, and its true strength lies deeper. As one crypto pundit explains, it lies in the alignment of incentives that keeps the network secure and the loyalty of holders who refuse to sell in the face of volatility. This combination of economic design and cultural conviction has allowed Bitcoin to weather every storm, proving that its foundation is far stronger than any single market cycle. Why Bitcoin Thrives On Patience, Not Speculation Bitcoin’s status as the largest cryptocurrency of all time is a direct result of its unique and powerful holdings . An analyst known as GhostOfTanzCho has revealed on X that other cryptocurrencies have tried to compete with Bitcoin, but none have succeeded in recreating that same gravity of conviction and holding culture. This culture, which is the key ingredient to its success, attracts people who wholeheartedly believe in holding, and it indoctrinates skeptics into an actionable belief of holding. There has never been another cryptocurrency that successfully recreated the holding culture that made Bitcoin great. However, the same culture is currently being replicated in SPX6900. GhostOfTanzCho argues that the success of a crypto token is fundamentally a reflection of supply and demand. By building a strong holding culture, a crypto token effectively solves the supply side of the equation by reducing sell pressure. Coincidentally, it also solves the demand side by incentivizing holders to create a critical mass of belief and interest. Thus, the SPX6900 could be one of the most significant crypto tokens of all time. Against all odds, it has done the impossible and has recreated the cultural DNA of Bitcoin. This model, which favors long-term believers over short-term traders, is described as the only way for a crypto token to become a market giant. When a critical mass of people have the conviction to hold long-term, trading becomes irrelevant, and the culture wins. Global Money Supply Surge Sets The Stage For BTC In the midst of heightened Bitcoin accumulation, a massive surge in global money supply is laying the groundwork for the next explosive crypto cycle , and BTC is already leading the charge. According to LondonRealTV’s founder Brian Rose, the expansion of the global money supply has historically been a leading driver of crypto bull cycles. With the price of BTC above $115,000, ETF inflows accelerating, and the total crypto market cap rising by $2 trillion in a single year, this shows liquidity is clearly returning. The analyst also highlights key risks that could trigger volatility . These include a potential reversal in monetary policy, where central banks begin to tighten the money supply, or large-scale profit-taking by major holders. Meanwhile, monitoring on-chain flows and capital rotation will be essential as the market cycle matures.",Bitcoin News|bitcoin|bitcoin news|bitcoin price|Brian Rose|btc|BTC news|btc price|btcusd|BTCUSDT|DNA|ETF|GhostOfTanzCho|LondonRealTV|spx6900,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|BTC|MARKET|TRADING|MACROECONOMICS,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-09-14 00:00:33

While Ethereum will lead the way in decentralized finance and smart contracts, a tide of interest is shifting towards a new coin Mutuum Finance (MUTM) . This cheap altcoin at just $0.035 has been supported by more than 16,240 investors. Mutuum Finance is quickly becoming one of the most anticipated projects in the market with its focus on liquidity solutions, long-term yield strategies, and connecting traditional finance and on-chain markets. Taking a cue from industry behemoths like ETH, MUTM aims to disrupt the market in 2025. Ethereum Steadies as Institutional Demand Picks Up Ethereum (ETH) is trading at $4,438.11, well above the $4,300 level as institutional purchases continue to back the market sentiment for 2025. Experts believe that ETH can challenge the $4,500–$4,700 zone if the momentum continues, which should be followed by the introduction of ETFs and regulatory backing in the next few months. Though Ethereum remains the darling of smart contracts and decentralized finance, new players in the DeFi market like Mutuum Finance are also creating ripples. Mutuum Finance Stage 6 FOMO Investors are purchasing MUTM tokens at $0.035 even at Stage 6 presale. Waiting for Stage 7. The token has, to date, been accumulated by over 16,240 investors and has raised over $15.63 million in funding, surely an indication of huge market demand and interest. Price Discovery USD-denominated market prices and native tokens such as ETH, MATIC, and AVAX have to render lending, borrowing, and liquidation secure. Mutuum Finance uses Chainlink oracles to provide the system with market prices. Fallback oracles, composite feed data, and time-weighted average decentralized exchange prices are also used by the system in pricing as close to perfection as possible under distress. Market volatility is transmitted to collateral management in the protocol. Mutuum Finance provides a split of Loan-to-Value (LTV) and liquidation levels based on token stability. It allows for a greater allowance and value to borrow in stable and safer tokens and applies lesser values to weaker tokens. Reserve multipliers are assigned proportionally on a 10% slope on risk-less holdings and 35% on risk holdings, facilitating default protection margin without being factored into diversification constraints. The Future of DeFi Mutuum Finance DeFi protocol makes it possible to attain active capital control through passive lending and borrowing with the potential to allow borrowers to borrow against stacks of securitised assets. System stability algorithm and interest rate optimisation algorithm are used in the system with functions to allow the system to be efficient and long term use of capital. Risk and Liquidity Management The protocol actively controls market volatility and liquidity to enable liquidation of damaged positions. Risk exposure is needed within limit parameters, and liquidation levels are established. Collateral assets such as stablecoins and ETH can be utilized to provide additional Loan-to-Value tiers, where more risky assets are collateralized by less risky assets. Reserve factors are pro-rata allocated to each token class to balance asset opportunity vs. risk in a way to accomplish overall protection of protocol holdings. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is quickly emerging as one of the top altcoins to monitor in 2025, after Ethereum (ETH), as institutional funds flow into crypto platforms. Stage 6 tokens are available for purchase at $0.035, with Stage 7 being 14.3% more, offering early buyers a quick profit margin. The presale already boasts 16,240+ investors and exceeded $15.63M, indicating massive demand. Ethereum is sitting at approximately $4,438 on ETF-driven inflows, but Mutuum Finance is gaining momentum as the DeFi project that all the pundits are hyping as the next institutional play. Get Stage 6 tokens today before the price goes ballistic again.

It restructured “Privacy & Scaling Explorations” as the “Privacy Stewards of Ethereum” (PSE). In Friday’s announcement, PSE said it hopes to add privacy solutions across the protocol, infrastructure, networking, application, and wallet layers and outlined several goals for the next 3-6 months. These included private transfers with the development of the PlasmaFold layer-2 network, confidential voting, and privacy for decentralized finance (DeFi) applications. The roadmap further suggested developing safeguards to protect personal data from exposure through remote procedure call (RPC) services and private identity solutions using zero-knowledge (ZK) proofs—verifying information without disclosing its specific contents. PSE defined its mission: “Ethereum deserves to become core infrastructure for global digital commerce, identity, collaboration, and the internet of value. But this potential is impossible without private data, transactions, and identity. We take responsibility within the Ethereum Foundation for ensuring privacy goals at the application layer are reached.” The announcement noted they would work with protocol teams to ensure that any L1 changes were needed to support strong, censorship-resistant, intermediary-free privacy. PSE pushes private transfers, confidential voting, and DeFi safeguards Privacy has always been at the core of the cypherpunk ethos that spawned cryptocurrencies. As crypto gains widespread adoption and the attention of governments, the crypto community is increasingly concerned about evolving digital financial surveillance methods . U.S. officials are weighing new regulations for the crypto industry and markets, including potential surveillance measures to monitor participant activity. The Department of the Treasury, led by Secretary Scott Bessent, is considering proposals to require government identity checks in smart contracts, an idea that has sparked pushback from the crypto community. Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin has long argued that privacy is a fundamental human right. In April, he cautioned that transparency functions more as a flaw than a feature in the digital age, stressing that privacy is essential to safeguard individuals amid the rise of state power and centralized corporations. Interoperability and intent-based architecture set as near-term priorities Recently, Ethereum Foundation researchers noted that interoperability is the top near-term priority for Ethereum development. In a blog post, the researchers wrote, “We see interoperability, and related projects presented in this note, as the highest leverage opportunity” within the user experience domain in the next six to 12 months. The near-term strategy focuses on intent-based architecture and general message-passing. Essentially, the focus is on approving users to express outcomes (or “intents”). At the same time, the network takes care of the low-level transactions and upgrades the crosschain “pipes” (message-passing infrastructure) so that those intents execute without delay across layer-1 and rollups. The Ethereum Foundation notes it will focus on optimizing for specific metrics, including time-to-inclusion, confirmation/finality, layer-2 settlement, and signatures per operation. The researchers indicated that interoperability is key since the Ethereum ecosystem is segmented into many layer-2 protocols that advance its functionality and scalability, while bringing “their own challenges, chief among them the pressures of fragmentation.” The post cites a significant pain point: “At its simplified core, the key ingredients to accelerate interop boil down to unlocking fast crosschain message-passing and standardisation. Currently, message-passing is partially bottlenecked by slow settlement times. Want your project in front of crypto’s top minds?

Notably, this discussion on trade tariffs and the flow of fentanyl was tackled earlier, but a trade deal was not struck due to disagreement between the two countries. Meanwhile, Chinese officials are still awaiting the White House’s response to the request to attend the summit, as it has not yet replied. China-US trade deal stalls amid growing uncertainties in their talks Sources familiar with the situation have highlighted that the chances for the Beijing summit are lower due to a lack of progress in talks between the two countries. As a result, they anticipated that Trump and Xi may meet in an informal setting at the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum, which will take place in October in South Korea. As uncertainty surrounds China-US trade and fentanyl talks, Steve Daines, a United States Senator, weighed in on the situation. According to the senator, for the two to strike a trade agreement, China must first stop the flow of fentanyl ingredients into the US. He made these remarks during his earlier meeting with Chinese officials in Beijing. This condition makes the situation even more complicated for leaders who intend to ease the tension between the two economies to reach a common ground. However, it is worth noting that the American senator still sparked hope for a meeting to be held before the end of 2025, although Trump had previously mentioned that it would take place soon. In a phone interview, Daines stated,” It would be difficult to discuss tariffs and other trade barriers until we resolve the fentanyl precursor issue.” What the US expects, according to the senator, is to see China taking drastic measures to stop the flow of fentanyl into the country completely and not just slowing it down. China urges that the US ease tariff policies on Chinese products Concerning the condition set forth for China, its officials expressed that they had done almost everything possible for the US, hence advocating that Trump should ease tariff policies on Chinese imports. This statement was made before the April 1 deadline for imposing the threatening tariff policies. Additionally, trade analysts had speculated that China might respond to any new trade barriers from the US. This was after they brought about the incident when China reacted to Trump’s 10% tariff policies on Chinese products in February and his additional 10% in March. Based on their analysis, China retaliated by imposing tariffs on several of the country’s agricultural products and suspended the importation of soybeans from three US-based firms. As the dispute drags on, trade tensions between the two countries continue to rise, leaving many hoping for a swift resolution.

51685142,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=821323,1757813426,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/21/51685142.jpeg,Here’s How The Bitcoin Price Macro Correction Could Play Out Next,https://www.newsbtc.com/news/bitcoin/heres-how-the-bitcoin-price-macro-correction-could-play-out-next/,"Despite experiencing a significant plunge from ATH levels earlier last month, the Bitcoin price continues to test crucial levels that could shape the trajectory of its next move. A fresh analysis from crypto market expert Casitrades suggests that the coming days could define whether the broader market will face a macro correction or extend its bullish momentum. For now, Fibonacci zones, Elliott Wave structures, and Relative Strength Index (RSI) behaviour align to build a critical narrative around BTC’s price direction. Possible Scenarios For Bitcoin Price Macro Correction On Friday, Casitrades explained in an X social media post that Bitcoin’s recent price surge has tested the 0.5 Fibonacci retracement level around $116,000, an important milestone in the recovery phase. Interestingly, despite this sudden push higher, the RSI highlighted on the price chart is yet to show the exhaustion one would typically expect at a major top. This suggests buyers may still have room to drive prices further upward before hitting a ceiling. Notably, the analyst pointed out $118,000 as the next critical level to watch, noting that it coincides with the 0.618 Fibonacci retracement and the 1.236 C-wave target within the developing Wave 2 structure. Casitrades has described this area as a decisive confluence point. A sharp rejection here could confirm that Bitcoin’s bull run has officially ended, reinforcing the theory that the cryptocurrency remains locked in a Wave 2 macro correction phase. On the other hand, the analyst noted that forming a top around the decisive confluence point would confirm that BTC is not ready to challenge or break into new all-time highs and could instead retrace deeper. As the chart illustrates, potential downside targets lie well below Bitcoin’s current price levels above $115,800, hinting that a failure at $118,000 could lead to a steeper correction that might drag the cryptocurrency back into the $110,000 – $106,000 zone in the near term. $122,000 Marks Final Test For Macro Correction While $118,000 remains the first line of resistance for Bitcoin, Casitrades highlighted that the cryptocurrency could extend its rally higher into the $120,000 – $122,000 zone if momentum persists. This level is viewed as the final test that will decide whether the macro correction holds or fails. It aligns with the 0.786 Fibonacci retracement, making it an even more formidable resistance area. The expectation is that if Bitcoin’s RSI shows signs of exhaustion and the cryptocurrency faces strong rejection in this region, the correction could be swift and significant. In this scenario, Bitcoin would set up for a macro downturn, confirming the theory that the rally from recent lows has merely been a corrective leg. Related Reading: Dogecoin Defies Odds, Jumps 21% Even As ETF Debut Gets Pushed Back The projected correction could then reset the broader structure, allowing for healthier long-term price action. However, if Bitcoin manages to break through $122,000 convincingly, Casitrades notes that it would invalidate the macro correction narrative altogether and potentially send it to price levels between $122,000 – $124,000.

It takes more than hype. It takes a finale that blends storytelling with staggering ROI. Arctic Pablo Coin (APC) has reached its long-awaited Stage 40, known as the Frozen Finale, where the FINAL400 code gives investors 5x tokens on every purchase. This isn’t just another presale. It’s a limited moment where narrative meets unmatched financial potential. The project pulls its community into a mythical adventure, led by the explorer Arctic Pablo on his snowmobile across icy frontiers, discovering shimmering APC tokens hidden in secret lands. Behind the story lies a carefully engineered token economy that delivers serious numbers. From $0.0012 per token in presale to a projected $0.008 listing price, whales are already calculating life-changing multipliers. And with analysts projecting a climb to $0.1, the potential ROI exceeds 8233 percent from Stage 40. While Arctic Pablo Coin dominates headlines with its 400 percent presale bonus, whales aren’t ignoring the broader picture. Chainlink and Bitcoin Cash remain two of the best new cryptos for exponential returns, each strengthening its place through utility and network growth. Together, these three projects highlight where big money is moving and why the countdown to Arctic Pablo Coin’s presale close is creating ripples across the market. Arctic Pablo Coin’s Frozen Finale – Whales Close In on the Best New Cryptos for Exponential Returns Arctic Pablo Coin (APC) has reached its last stage, and the atmosphere around the presale is electric. The 40th stage, named the Frozen Finale, is a presale event unlike anything seen before. At the current entry price of $0.0012, every allocation multiplies by five through the FINAL400 code, turning even modest commitments into potential windfalls. With over $4 million already raised and whales openly tracking the numbers, this is the kind of opportunity designed for those chasing exponential returns. The presale tally alone is staggering, but the real intrigue lies in ROI potential. A buyer entering Stage 40 today sees an immediate 567 percent upside when APC lists at $0.008. But it doesn’t stop there. Analysts are projecting a rise to $0.1, creating an 8233 percent return for those who hold. Compare that with the 7900 percent gains already achieved by the earliest joiners, and the sheer magnitude of what’s possible at this stage becomes undeniable. The countdown ends September 16 as APC launches on Coinstore and PancakeSwap. Investment Example – A Whale-Sized Scenario Take a $10,000 allocation at $0.0012. That nets 8,333,333 tokens. With the FINAL400 5x multiplier, the stash grows to 41,666,665 tokens. If APC launches at $0.008, that pile is suddenly worth $333,333. If it rockets to $0.1 as analysts predict, the return explodes to $4.16 million. Numbers like these explain why crypto whales are racing to secure positions before the finale closes. Myth Meets Mechanics – Why APC Feels Different Unlike typical presales, Arctic Pablo Coin weaves an adventurous storyline into its tokenomics. The mythical journey across frozen lands isn’t just branding; it’s a way to connect holders with a vision that feels bigger than numbers. The blend of narrative and mechanics creates loyalty, while deflationary burns and staking at 66% APY build real economic strength. For whales, that combination of emotional resonance and financial rigor is magnetic. Beyond the Finale – Utility That Holds The excitement doesn’t stop at presale. APC’s system is designed to reward the community through staking, referral incentives, and competitions with USD and token prizes. Weekly token burns add scarcity, ensuring the supply tightens over time. By mixing staking rewards with a deflationary design, Arctic Pablo Coin positions itself not only as the most electrifying meme coin presale but also as one of the best new cryptos for exponential returns. Chainlink’s Role in the World of Smart Contracts Chainlink continues to hold its ground as the top decentralized oracle network, connecting blockchains with real-world data. For projects that need accurate feeds of prices, weather, or financial data, Chainlink remains unmatched. This utility has made it a backbone for DeFi platforms, NFT ecosystems, and even enterprise-grade blockchain solutions. The reason whales keep an eye on Chainlink is simple: reliability. Without accurate external data, smart contracts can’t function properly, and Chainlink has built a reputation for trust that spans years. Its ability to expand beyond price feeds into automation and cross-chain communication is what makes it resilient and relevant even when markets shift. Chainlink’s continued adoption positions it alongside APC and Bitcoin Cash in the current lineup of the best new cryptos for exponential returns, not through presale excitement but by holding a critical role in blockchain infrastructure. Bitcoin Cash – The Underrated Utility Player Bitcoin Cash (BCH) takes the fundamentals of Bitcoin but optimizes them for daily use. With faster transactions and lower fees, it aims to be more practical for everyday payments. Retailers and payment processors are increasingly turning to Bitcoin Cash as an option for customers, which strengthens its role as a true transactional crypto. For whales, BCH represents a utility coin that may not carry the explosive presale hype of APC but still offers steady adoption. Its value lies in being usable across markets where fast, affordable crypto payments are becoming the norm. As more businesses and users experiment with blockchain for payments, Bitcoin Cash remains a viable tool in the mix of best new cryptos for exponential returns. Conclusion The final stage of Arctic Pablo Coin’s presale has become a spectacle that whales cannot ignore. With the FINAL400 code delivering 5x tokens at $0.0012 and ROI projections reaching as high as 8233 percent, it’s no surprise that the Frozen Finale is creating waves across the crypto community. The mix of myth, mechanics, and deflationary design makes APC stand apart as the most thrilling meme coin presale currently live. Chainlink and Bitcoin Cash also deserve their mentions. Chainlink continues to expand its role as the bridge between blockchains and real-world data, while Bitcoin Cash pushes the case for everyday crypto adoption through speed and affordability. Both play important roles, but it’s Arctic Pablo Coin’s presale finale that has whales buzzing louder than ever. For those hunting the best new cryptos for exponential returns , the message is clear. Chainlink and Bitcoin Cash provide proven strength, but Arctic Pablo Coin’s Frozen Finale offers a closing act that could turn allocations into millions.

The FINAL400 code multiplies every purchase by five, giving investors 400 percent more tokens. It’s active only during Stage 40, the Frozen Finale, and ends once the presale closes. Why are whales interested in Arctic Pablo Coin? Crypto whales are attracted to the massive ROI projections. At $0.0012, tokens can multiply 567 percent by listing and 8233 percent at analyst targets, with bonuses making allocations even larger. What is the difference between Arctic Pablo Coin and a typical meme coin presale? Unlike standard meme coin projects, Arctic Pablo Coin combines narrative-driven branding with real mechanics like staking, token burns, and referral programs. This mix of story and structure adds depth. Is Chainlink still considered essential for DeFi? Yes. Chainlink’s decentralized oracles provide accurate real-world data, which is crucial for DeFi protocols, NFT projects, and other blockchain systems that rely on external information. How is Bitcoin Cash being used today? Bitcoin Cash is increasingly being adopted for everyday payments due to its faster transaction times and lower fees, making it practical for retailers and users seeking efficiency. Summary Arctic Pablo Coin’s Stage 40 Frozen Finale is reshaping what a presale can deliver. With a 400 percent FINAL400 bonus, whales are rushing to capture ROI potential that stretches beyond 8233 percent. Chainlink continues to power blockchain infrastructure with reliable oracles, while Bitcoin Cash strengthens its role as a payments-focused cryptocurrency. Together, they outline a diverse market, but it’s APC’s finale that stands out as the most electrifying opportunity among the best new cryptos for exponential returns.

At the same time, MAGACOIN FINANCE is catching attention as a top altcoin pick to ride alongside Bitcoin’s run. Whales dump $12.7B Bitcoin, pressuring short-term prices Bitcoin whales sold over 115,000 BTC worth $12.7 billion in the past month — the biggest sell-off since mid-2022. According to analysts at CryptoQuant, this wave of selling shows large holders are cutting risk exposure, which has pushed Bitcoin below $108,000 in recent weeks. Despite this pressure, many say the outlook for Bitcoin hasn’t changed. Data shows whale selling has slowed, with the seven-day balance drop easing from 95,000 BTC to 38,000 BTC. Meanwhile, institutional buying has helped balance out the selling. While short-term moves may stay choppy, Bitcoin has only corrected 13% from its record high, far less than past pullbacks. Analysts keep $150K–$250K Bitcoin forecasts alive Even with whales selling, experts believe Bitcoin is on track for bigger gains. Canary Capital CEO Steven McClurg says there’s more than a 50% chance Bitcoin hits $150K this year, thanks to treasury inflows and ETF demand. Michael Saylor also noted that most equity analysts see Bitcoin reaching $150K by Christmas. Adding to the bullish outlook, Tom Lee of Fundstrat Global reaffirmed his $250K target for Bitcoin by Christmas 2025. He highlighted Bitcoin’s history of fourth-quarter rallies and pointed to the Fed’s September rate decision as a key trigger. Together, these predictions show that analysts still believe Bitcoin’s path is upward, even in the face of recent whale pressure. MAGACOIN FINANCE: altcoin pick to ride Bitcoin’s $250K journey Amid Bitcoin momentum, analysts say smaller altcoins can move faster. MAGACOIN FINANCE is one that has been named as a top pick to buy alongside Bitcoin. Unlike Bitcoin, which already has a huge market cap, MAGACOIN FINANCE is newer and undervalued, which gives it room to grow at a quicker pace. Why MAGACOIN FINANCE: Smaller and newer, making 120X moves faster than Bitcoin Analyst pick as a top coin to diversify with Thousands of holders already in early Seen as a hedge for those who missed earlier Bitcoin runs For those looking to diversify while betting on Bitcoin’s path to $250K, this altcoin is one to watch closely. How traders can position now Bitcoin’s long-term forecast remains bullish despite short-term whale selling. Traders looking to position for the next big run should consider both Bitcoin and newer altcoins like MAGACOIN FINANCE. Acting early gives the best chance to benefit from upcoming moves.

Here’s why,https://timestabloid.com/expert-to-xrp-holders-the-next-leg-up-will-be-violent-heres-why/,"Gordon (@AltcoinGordon), a popular crypto pundit, believes XRP is nearing a decisive move. Backed by two weeks of steady accumulation from buyers, he suggested that the next phase of price action could be “violent,” pointing to a possible breakout after a period of consolidation and recovery. XRP’s Recent Price Performance XRP faced a notable downturn in late August. This poor performance remained until September, when its price hit a low point of $2.71 on September 1. Despite this correction, XRP’s price action shifted positively in the following weeks. By September 7, it had recovered, regaining stability just below $3 . The rebound signaled that buyers were returning to defend key levels after weeks of pressure. Since that recovery, XRP has struggled to break cleanly through $3.1, which now acts as a zone of resistance. The price has tested this level repeatedly without a sustained breakout. At the same time, the $2.90 area has held firm as a support zone, giving XRP a clear range in which its next move will be defined. Traders remain watchful of whether momentum from the recent bounce can translate into a breakout above resistance. 2 solid weeks of BUYING from the $XRP Army. The next leg up will be VIOLENT. Do you understand? pic.twitter.com/VzGKIPYSJP — Gordon (@AltcoinGordon) September 12, 2025 The Pattern on the Chart The chart Gordon shared provides further clarity on why he expects a significant move. It shows that XRP broke out of a long-term downtrend in July, climbing to an all-time high of $3.65 . The decline into late August represented a corrective phase, forming a shorter-term descending trendline. This line of resistance has now been tested multiple times, with the latest weekly candle showing strength above $3 and closing in on that descending barrier. This setup indicates that XRP is approaching a breakout point. A sustained push above $3.1 would end the short-term downtrend and confirm renewed positive momentum. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 What’s Next for XRP? If buyers maintain their position, the asset could target its all-time high again, and potentially create a new one before the end of September. Conversely, if XRP fails to overcome this structure, it risks dropping back to the $2.8 range. Gordon’s confidence rests on the consistent buying pressure over the past two weeks. Multiple weekly green candles suggest that accumulation is underway, and traders are positioning ahead of a potential breakout . His description of the next leg as “violent” highlights expectations of a strong upward move once resistance is cleared.

With momentum now building, the focus has shifted to the next major test: the $117,000 resistance level. A decisive move above this threshold would not only confirm the continuation of the current rally but also set the stage for a potential run toward new highs. Daily Support Flip Confirms Bullish Control Alpha Crypto Signal, in a recent market update, pointed out that BTC is showing renewed strength on the daily timeframe. The leading cryptocurrency successfully flipped a key horizontal zone into support, a move that highlights growing buyer dominance in the market. This structural shift is seen as a positive development for bulls, laying the groundwork for further upside momentum. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Flashes ‘Rarest Signal’ Ever, Is A 100% Rally Possible? With buyers firmly in control, Bitcoin’s price action is now being driven higher toward the previous swing high near $117,000. This level has emerged as the next significant hurdle for bulls, acting as a critical area where market sentiment could either extend the rally or spark profit-taking. The analysis further noted that if Bitcoin manages to push above $117,000, the level itself could turn into an attractive area for potential short setups. However, such a strategy carries risks, as the invalidation point would be a decisive breakout above BTC’s all-time high. Until then, $117,000 stands out as the key level of interest for market participants. How Bitcoin reacts in this zone will determine whether it consolidates, faces rejection, or surges higher. For traders, this level offers a critical point to evaluate possible entries, exits, and positioning as the next major move takes shape. Bitcoin Struggles To Secure A Hold Above $116,000 According to a recent post by Crypto VIP Signal, Bitcoin is continuing its upward trajectory. However, the cryptocurrency has not yet been able to firmly hold above the $116,000 level, which suggests that while the overall trend is bullish, buyers have yet to fully overcome this significant hurdle. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Recovery Hopes Rise – Can Bulls Push It Past Resistance? Crypto VIP Signal’s analysis notes that the entire market is looking positive, but a temporary slowdown can be expected. This is primarily attributed to a decline in trading volume, which is a common occurrence on weekends as activity from institutional traders and large investors often lessens. Given these conditions, Crypto VIP Signal predicts that Bitcoin will likely experience a period of sideways movement. The consolidation phase would allow the market to digest recent gains and build the necessary momentum to attempt another push past the $116,000 resistance.

When we talk about USDT minted , we are referring to the creation of new Tether tokens. USDT is the largest stablecoin by market capitalization, designed to maintain a 1:1 peg with the US dollar. Tether Treasury is the entity responsible for issuing and redeeming these tokens. Minting Process: New USDT tokens are typically minted when users or institutions deposit fiat currency (like USD) with Tether. This process increases the total supply of USDT in circulation. Purpose: The primary purpose is to meet demand for stablecoin liquidity in the crypto market. Traders use USDT to quickly move in and out of volatile cryptocurrencies without converting back to fiat, and for arbitrage opportunities. Market Signal: A large issuance often suggests an increased demand for stablecoins, indicating that more capital is potentially preparing to enter or move within the crypto market. Therefore, this 1 billion USDT minted event represents a substantial injection of potential buying power into the digital asset space. How Does Massive USDT Minting Impact the Crypto Market? The issuance of a significant amount of USDT can have various ripple effects across the cryptocurrency landscape. While not a direct causation, it often correlates with increased market activity. Historically, large USDT issuances have sometimes preceded periods of market rallies for cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum. This is because the newly minted USDT can be used to purchase these assets, thereby increasing demand and potentially their prices. Consider these points: Increased Liquidity: More USDT means more capital available for trading pairs, making it easier to execute large trades without significant price slippage. Potential Buying Pressure: If the newly minted USDT is deployed to buy other cryptocurrencies, it can create upward price pressure. Market Sentiment: Such events are often interpreted as a bullish signal, reflecting confidence from large investors or institutions. However, it is also important to note that the actual impact depends on how this newly available USDT is utilized. It might sit in exchange wallets or be used for other purposes. Tether’s Central Role and Transparency Discussions Tether holds a dominant position in the stablecoin market, making any major event like 1 billion USDT minted particularly noteworthy. Its widespread adoption across exchanges and trading platforms solidifies its importance. The company has faced ongoing discussions regarding the composition and transparency of its reserves, which back the USDT tokens. While Tether regularly publishes attestations of its reserves, some market participants continue to call for full, independent audits. This conversation is an important aspect of the stablecoin ecosystem, emphasizing the need for robust financial backing. The continued issuance of large amounts of USDT minted tokens underscores Tether’s critical function in providing stability and liquidity to the volatile crypto markets, despite these ongoing dialogues about its operational transparency. Navigating the Future: What to Watch After This USDT Minted Event? For investors and traders, monitoring the aftermath of a significant USDT minted event offers actionable insights. Observing how this newly available capital moves through the blockchain can provide clues about future market directions. Here’s what to keep an eye on: On-Chain Flows: Track where the minted USDT is sent. Is it moving to exchanges, or being held in large wallets? Trading Volume: Look for increases in trading volumes for major cryptocurrencies, particularly Bitcoin and Ethereum, as this could indicate the deployment of new capital. Market Depth: Assess if market depth on exchanges improves, suggesting more liquidity. Ultimately, while the 1 billion USDT minted is a significant data point, its true impact will unfold as market participants decide how to utilize this fresh injection of stablecoin liquidity. Staying informed and analyzing subsequent market movements is key. In conclusion, the recent issuance of 1 billion USDT minted by Tether Treasury is a powerful indicator of demand for stablecoin liquidity within the cryptocurrency market. It highlights Tether’s continued relevance and prompts market participants to closely observe potential shifts in asset prices and trading dynamics. These large-scale minting events serve as crucial checkpoints for understanding the evolving landscape of digital finance. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) What does it mean when USDT is ‘minted’? When USDT is ‘minted,’ it means new Tether tokens are created and added to the total supply. This usually happens when users or institutions deposit fiat currency (like US dollars) with Tether, requesting an equivalent amount of USDT in return. Why does Tether mint such large amounts of USDT? Tether mints large amounts of USDT to meet the growing demand for stablecoin liquidity in the cryptocurrency market. This demand comes from traders, institutions, and platforms needing a stable asset for trading, hedging, and transferring value efficiently across exchanges. Does a large USDT minting always lead to a crypto price rally? Not always. While large USDT minting events often correlate with increased buying pressure and can precede price rallies, it’s not a guaranteed outcome. The minted USDT might be used for various purposes, including holding, arbitrage, or institutional transactions, and its impact on prices depends on how it is deployed. Where can I track USDT minting events? Services like Whale Alert often report significant USDT minting events. You can also monitor Tether’s official transparency report or use blockchain explorers that track the Tether Treasury wallet for real-time data on supply changes. What is the role of Tether Treasury in the crypto ecosystem? Tether Treasury acts as the issuer and redeemer of USDT tokens. Its role is to manage the supply of USDT, ensuring that new tokens are created against reserves and that tokens can be redeemed for fiat currency, thereby maintaining the stablecoin’s peg to the US dollar.

Internet Computer protocol price forecast for 2028 expects the token to reach a peak price of $23.39. By 2031, the price of Internet Computer might reach a maximum of $38.01. Internet Computer (ICP) is a groundbreaking blockchain network developed by the DFINITY Foundation. It aims to extend the functionality of the internet, enabling it to host backend software and transforming it into a global, decentralized computer. Internet computer blockchain incorporates advanced cryptography and innovative technology to provide scalable, efficient, and secure decentralized applications (dApps). Given its robust technology and expanding utility, the Internet Computer blockchain’s future price prospects look promising. As more developers build on the platform and adoption increases, ICP token demand will likely rise. Does Internet Computer coin have a future? How much will Internet Computer coin cost in 2025? Will ICP reach $1000? Let’s get into the current price analysis and predictions. Overview Cryptocurrency Internet Computer Token ICP Price $4.96 Market Cap $2.67B Trading Volume $61.83M Circulating Supply 538.03M ICP All-time High $750.73 (May 10, 2021) All-time Low $2.86 (Sep 2023) 24-h High $5.16 24-h Low $4.97 Internet Computer Network technical analysis Metric Value Volatility (30-day period) 4.93% 14-Day RSI 47.15 50-Day SMA $5.20 Sentiment Bearish Fear & Greed Index 52 (Neutral) Green Days 13/30 (43%) 200-Day SMA $5.43 Internet Computer price analysis TL;DR Breakdown ICP failed to break above $5.13–$5.16 resistance and is now pulling back. Daily indicators show waning momentum, though MACD remains slightly bullish. ICP 1-day price analysis As of September 4, ICP is trading around $5.00 after retesting the $5.13 resistance on the daily chart and getting rejected. The rejection happened after a steady move from the $4.65 range which has been strong support for ICP. The Bollinger Bands are showing ICP pressuring the upper band at $5.13 with today’s red candle indicating sellers are coming in. ICPUSDT 1-day price chart by TradingView The RSI is currently sitting around 45 which definitely puts ICP in neutral and allows for a breakout or a pullback to develop, while the MACD just crossed into positive territory today; however, looking at the histogram a slight flattening of momentum is present which indicates some caution. If bulls defend the support at $4.89, we may see another retest of the $5.13 – $5.20 region. If price were to drop below the $4.89 level, we could then expect further downside on the $4.65 level. ICP 4-hour price analysis On the 4-hour chart, ICP has slid from $5.16 and is currently testing support near $4.95, where the 21-period SMA is also located. The rejection at $5.16 indicates strong supply in the overall price action capping any upside. Should buyers not defend the support at $4.95, ICP has the potential to slide down to deeper supports at $4.81 and potentially $4.68. ICPUSDT 4-hour price chart by TradingView Volume has significantly decreased since the last push up, and OBV has been declining since, indicating a decreasing accumulation pressure. For bulls to take back control over the price action, we will need to see ICP reclaim $5.05 quickly and trade strongly above $5.16 with volume. Until we see that happen, it looks like ICP will consolidate between $4.81 and $5.16, with sellers holding the upper hand short term. ICP technical indicators: Levels and action Daily simple moving average (SMA) Period Value Action SMA 3 $4.92 BUY SMA 5 $4.97 BUY SMA 10 $4.95 BUY SMA 21 $4.99 BUY SMA 50 $5.20 SELL SMA 100 $5.23 SELL SMA 200 $5.43 SELL Daily exponential moving average (EMA) Period Value Action EMA 3 $4.84 BUY EMA 5 $4.87 BUY EMA 10 $4.96 BUY EMA 21 $5.10 SELL EMA 50 $5.23 SELL EMA 100 $5.34 SELL EMA 200 $5.89 SELL What to expect from ICP price analysis ICP is at a key decision point around $5. A hold above $4.95 keeps the door open for another test of $5.13–$5.16, with a breakout eyeing $5.30. Losing $4.95, however, shifts momentum bearish, exposing $4.81 and $4.68. For now, consolidation looks most likely until a clear breakout decides the next trend. Is Internet Computer a good investment?

This movement has seen the meme cryptocurrency make a push towards the upper end of a consolidation range in the daily candlestick timeframe chart. A recent analysis shared on TradingView by The_Alchemist_Trader points to a possible shift in momentum, as Dogecoin is retesting its point of control with a bullish reaction that might push it to $0.35 in the short term and as high as $0.6 in the long term. Related Reading: Dogecoin Defies Odds, Jumps 21% Even As ETF Debut Gets Pushed Back Dogecoin Retesting Point Of Control According to the analysis, Dogecoin is currently testing its point of control, a high-volume resistance area that has defined much of its trading structure in recent months. This price action goes as far back as February with well-defined upper and lower trendlines. Interestingly, price action volume in the past 48 hours shows that buyers are stepping in aggressively at the mid-level of this range, which is around $0.25. This is very important, and a daily close above the point of control with strong volume would translate from range-bound movement to a defined upward rally. This bullish reaction comes after Dogecoin bounced at $0.2 last week, a move that created a solid foundation for another leg upward. Now, according to the analyst, the next thing is for Dogecoin to make a close basis above its point of control resistance. Roadmap To $0.35 Through Fibonacci Levels Fibonacci extension levels have served as reliable indicators of profit-taking and continuation levels for Dogecoin in the current cycles. As such, many analysts are fond of pointing to price targets at notable Fib levels. In this case, the analyst noted that a successful breakout above the point of control at $0.25 opens the path toward the 0.618 Fibonacci retracement level. This level, which is positioned around $0.35, stands out as the primary upside target in the current setup. The chart below shows a projected rally pattern for this breakout with a clear roadmap drawn to the 0.618 Fibonacci extension level. This also includes extensions to the $0.36 price level at the 0.66 Fib extension and the $0.4 price level at the 0.786 Fib extension if the momentum continues. A move toward $0.35 would represent not just a technical price target but also a strong confirmation that Dogecoin has reestablished bullish dominance above its consolidation range since February. From here, Dogecoin could start holding up above $0.3 again. Related Reading: ETF Dreams For Dogecoin: Serious Possibility Or Just Hype? Dogecoin’s short-term movement is now tilted to the upside, provided the price continues to close above the point of control with strong participation from buyers. Volume is the most important thing here, as a breakout without sufficient backing could result in a false move and cause Dogecoin to return to range trading. At the time of writing, Dogecoin is about to break above the upper trendline of its multi-month range. Dogecoin is currently trading at $0.2874, up by 12.6% and 33% in the past 24 hours and seven days, respectively.

According to his analysis, this level is significant because it aligns with the 21 SMA (simple moving average). Egrag Crypto noted that this retest has now been completed, making $3.07 the critical price point that must be closely monitored. He emphasized that a decisive close above this level is required to confirm a breakout from the symmetrical triangle pattern outlined in his charts. #XRP – The Retest of $3.07 Near the 21 SMA is Completed: We’re currently observing a retest of the $3.07 level, which is crucial as it aligns with the 21 SMA (Simple Moving Average). For a #Bullish signal, we need a clear close above $3.07 to confirm the break-out from the… pic.twitter.com/XNdCrgK4Fe — EGRAG CRYPTO (@egragcrypto) September 12, 2025 Technical Observations Egrag’s charts illustrate the symmetrical triangle that has formed, with $3.07 positioned at the point of convergence between the triangle’s upper boundary and the moving average. The first chart he shared was labeled with the 21 SMA, while the latter chart displayed the 21 EMA. Despite the labeling differences, his commentary referred broadly to the 21 SMA as the reference point. The visuals also reveal resistance areas above $3.07, with potential upside targets in the $3.30 to $4.20 range, while downside risk levels remain visible near $2.55 and $2.00. Conditions for Bullish Confirmation Egrag explained that the confirmation of a bullish move depends entirely on a clear close above $3.07. Without this confirmation, the symmetrical triangle remains unresolved, and the market could still test the lower support levels. He advised traders to wait for the breakout signal before making moves, highlighting that acting prematurely could expose positions to unnecessary risk. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Moving Forward The update underscores that XRP’s immediate future depends on whether it can establish a solid position above $3.07. A breakout and close above this point would open the pathway toward the higher levels identified in Egrag’s charts. Conversely, failure to achieve this could result in renewed downward pressure, leaving the $2.55 and $2.00 levels as potential areas of support. By providing two updated charts, Egrag Crypto highlighted that traders should view the 21 moving averages as a decisive line in this setup, regardless of whether it is described as SMA or EMA. As the retest is completed, the market now waits for a decisive close to determine a bullish breakout. Until that condition is met, patience remains essential, and positions should only be taken once the breakout has been validated.

At the same time, bitcoin has lost some ground to silver, and it’s currently in the 8th position. Ripple Is Back CryptoPotato reported back on August 23 that XRP had found a place within the aforementioned ranking, as, at the time, it had become the 99th biggest asset on CompaniesMarketCap. The following few weeks were quite turbulent for the entire cryptocurrency market, and XRP was not spared. The cross-border token dipped in price from $3.02, which was enough to keep its market cap around $180 billion, to a multi-month low of $2.70. Consequently, the asset fell out of that coveted group. However, the crypto market has been on a strong rebound in the past week. XRP is no exception, as it has jumped by 10% and now trades at $3.10 after it was rejected yesterday at $3.20 . Still, its market cap is up to $185 billion, which makes it the 94th largest global asset by that metric. It has surpassed the likes of Citigroup, Xiaomi, and Airbus on the way up, while some of the next big names in its scope are Verizon, Shopify, Commonwealth Bank, and Uber. Assets by Market Cap. Source: CompaniesMarketCap BTC Battles Silver As the market leader and largest in the industry, BTC was the first to enter the top 100 assets. Its growth over the past several years has pushed it into the largest 10. Although at one point it had climbed above silver and Amazon and was aiming at fifth, it has lost some ground, while the aforementioned duo has been on an uptrend (especially the precious metal). Now, bitcoin’s market cap stands at just over $2.3 trillion, which makes it the 8th largest global asset. Silver is above it with a market cap of $2.4 trillion. Gold continues to be the undisputed leader with a market cap of nearly $25 trillion after it marked a new all-time high against the greenback earlier this week. Ethereum’s recent meteoric rise has driven it to the 22nd spot in this ranking, slightly above Mastercard and Netflix, and behind Visa and Tencent.

Here’s why,https://timestabloid.com/pundit-october-could-be-the-biggest-month-in-xrp-history-heres-why/,"Crypto investor Armando Pantoja, also known as Tall Guy Tycoon, has suggested that October could be the most significant month in XRP’s history. In a recent video shared on X, he stated that XRP might be approaching a critical moment that few are openly addressing. Pantoja explained that between October 18 and October 25, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission is set to review seven XRP-related filings. He described this review window as potentially decisive, with outcomes that could reshape XRP’s position in the digital asset market. #XRP : Could October be the biggest month in $XRP History?? pic.twitter.com/aPcLj0KtEr — Armando Pantoja (@_TallGuyTycoon) September 11, 2025 ETF Approval Probabilities Pantoja noted that PolyMark has placed the likelihood of approval for an XRP exchange-traded fund at 95%, a figure he described as extremely favorable. He drew a comparison to Bitcoin, pointing out that the leading cryptocurrency rose by 52% in the months following its own ETF approval. According to his assessment, the implication is that XRP could experience a similar trajectory if granted the same level of regulatory recognition. He emphasized that such an event could introduce a new phase of market momentum for the asset. Institutional Signals Another key factor highlighted by Pantoja was the rapid increase in XRP futures activity. He reported that open interest in XRP futures has climbed by 74%, which he interprets as a signal that institutional investors are positioning themselves ahead of a potential major development. He stressed that this level of engagement from larger market participants suggests anticipation of substantial movement in XRP’s valuation. Retail Participation and Market Potential In his video, Pantoja recalled XRP’s prior rise from $0.50 to nearly $4. He emphasized that during that surge, trading volumes remained close to historic averages, a sign that retail investors were not heavily involved in the move. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 He pointed to this as a positive factor, arguing that the market still has untapped potential if retail participation increases. He stated that his personal target range for XRP lies between $8 and $12 in the current cycle, while adding that an ETF approval could create conditions for surpassing that range. Pantoja concluded his remarks by questioning whether October would be the month when XRP definitively proves itself in the market. He left viewers with the consideration that regulatory decisions, institutional signals, and market conditions are aligning in a way that makes this period especially critical for XRP.

His post, titled “The Power of the Waves”, highlights significant Fibonacci targets while emphasizing that XRP is currently breaking through its initial weekly resistance. ""The Power of the Waves"" Initial weekly resistance is being broken right now. #XRP targets, $4.39 and the $5.85 Fibonacci levels Supports: $3.01, $2.85. As clear as it gets. pic.twitter.com/MjaAqczjSU — Dark Defender (@DefendDark) September 12, 2025 Price Targets and Resistance Levels In the update, Dark Defender identified $4.39 and $5.85 as the next major price targets based on the Fibonacci retracement levels. He specified that the $4.39 level corresponds with the 161.80% extension, while the $5.85 target represents the 261.80% extension. According to his chart, XRP is moving past a crucial resistance area, indicating that the path toward higher price zones could be opening if momentum continues. The analysis further illustrates how XRP has been following a wave structure pattern. Dark Defender labeled previous corrections and outlined the current cycle, suggesting that the digital asset may be entering the next upward phase. His projection shows the possibility of XRP rising beyond its recent range if the breakout sustains. Support Zones While pointing to higher price projections, Dark Defender also outlined critical support levels. He highlighted $3.01 and $2.85 as areas where XRP could find buying strength if the market experiences a pullback. These levels were noted as important reference points to watch, as they could provide stability before any attempt to reach the higher Fibonacci extensions. The chart attached to his post also displayed a broader range of Fibonacci zones, with additional retracement points around $1.88 on the downside and further extensions mapped out above $5.00 . This suggests that Dark Defender is considering both upward momentum and possible corrections within the structure of the ongoing cycle. Community Response Followers of Dark Defender reacted to the analysis with optimism. A user named Blue Tears commented that “The target price is like a rocket, the support level is as solid as a steel plate, and we will see a new wave soon.” Another community member, SelinaQueen, expressed appreciation for the detailed breakdown. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 The responses reflect a strong interest in the outlined targets, with many looking closely at whether XRP can maintain its momentum and achieve the projected Fibonacci extensions. Dark Defender’s technical outlook underscores the importance of both resistance breakthroughs and support confirmations in XRP’s ongoing price action. With the $4.39 and $5.85 levels marked as the next potential upside goals, attention now turns to whether XRP can sustain its current trajectory while maintaining support above $3.01 and $2.85. As the market progresses, XRP’s reaction to these critical levels will provide further clarity on whether the wave structure aligns with Dark Defender’s projections.

One of them is Little Pepe (LILPEPE), and at present, it is rocking its structurally sound yet meme-driven Layer 2 ecosystem. As its presale approaches taking a final shape, some analysts believe that LILPEPE will make an exceptional project in 2025. Little Pepe (LILPEPE): A Meme Coin With Real Utility Unlike most meme tokens, Little Pepe (LILPEPE) is built on a next-generation Layer 2 blockchain explicitly designed for meme culture. The project blends low fees, fast transaction finality, and strong security while offering features rarely seen in other meme projects, such as sniper-bot resistance and a dedicated memes launchpad. This unique combination could set LILPEPE apart in a crowded market. The presale is already in Stage 12, priced at $0.0021 per token, and is almost entirely sold out. Data shows that over 97% of tokens have been purchased, with $24,565,284 raised out of a $25,475,000 target. More than 15.3 billion tokens have already been sold, signalling strong early demand and community momentum. At listing, the token is expected to debut at $0.003, offering early buyers potential upside even before exchange expansion. Beyond tokenomics, Little Pepe is also running one of the most aggressive promotional campaigns in the meme coin sector. Its Mega Giveaway rewards top buyers across Stages 12–17 with more than 15 ETH in prizes. The largest buyer may receive 5 ETH, while additional rewards are distributed among the second, third, and 15 randomly selected participants. Combined with the already announced $77,000 giveaway for 10 winners, this initiative reinforces Little Pepe’s focus on rewarding community commitment. Cardano (ADA): The Long-Term Builder One of the most studied blockchain projects in the sector is currently Cardano (ADA). With a peer-reviewed model and a proof-of-stake blockchain, through the years, Cardano has grown its ecosystem by adding smart contracts, decentralized applications, and DeFi integrations. Despite the increasing trend of ADA, it is more of a long-term strategy of development rather than a spike. Investors who are looking at near-term returns may still find value in ADA if the market conditions become more bullish. But its trend would imply lower compounding returns instead of a 10x potential in a brief period, such as 80 days. Ripple (XRP): Steering Clear of Regulation. Ripple (XRP) has always been a bridge currency to the financial institutions around the world. Its use of cross-border payments is also not old-fashioned, and the end of its high-profile regulatory dispute in the United States may assist XRP to have a brighter future. It is not uncommon to find market participants arguing that a favorable environment would restore XRP to the limelight. Yet, XRP’s growth may depend heavily on legal and institutional developments. While the token has the liquidity and infrastructure to rise, its performance in the next 80 days may be constrained compared to newer entrants capturing speculative attention. Why LILPEPE May Outperform The value proposition of Little Pepe (LILPEPE) is entirely different than that of Cardano (ADA) and Ripple (XRP). Whereas ADA and XRP must rely on gradual but consistent adoption, LILPEPE has access to the virality of meme culture, as well as concrete blockchain innovation. Its virtually sold-out presale, coupled with the buzz surrounding giveaways and exchange listings, indicates that it could have greater near-term upside potential. Conclusion Cardano (ADA) and Ripple (XRP) continue to be essential contenders in blockchain and have their own advantages in technology and payments. Nevertheless, Little Pepe (LILPEPE) may become a more dynamic project within 80 days because of its presale energy and other incentives driven by the community and Layer 2 meme-specific ecosystem. While speculative, data indicate that LILPEPE may hold the strongest position among the three for investors seeking rapid gains.

Expectedly for a weekend trading, most altcoins are quite sluggish with little to no moves in either direction. However, there are a few exceptions. BTC Keeps Calm at $116K The aforementioned price recovery began at the start of the current month when bitcoin slumped to a multi-week low of just over $107,000. The asset tested that support on a couple of occasions in just a few days at the time. However, the bulls ultimately managed to defend it and initiated leg-ups that drove BTC to over $110,000 within days. It kept climbing and challenged $113,000 on September 5 and 9, where it faced immediate rejections. Nevertheless, that level finally gave in on September 1,0 and BTC hasn’t looked back since. Just the opposite, it kept rising and knocked on the $116,000 door on Friday. The bulls pushed it beyond that level on Saturday morning and up to a multi-week high of $116,700, but the cryptocurrency failed to move upwards. It has been driven to just under $116,000 as of press time, which is still impressive given the latest macroeconomic developments and threats on the USA vs Russia/China front from yesterday. For now, BTC’s market cap is still above the $2.3 trillion mark, while its dominance over the alts has recovered some ground and is up to 55.4% on CG. BTCUSD. Source: TradingView PUMP Pumps As mentioned above, there’s little volatility from the larger-cap alts. Ethereum was stopped at over $4,700 yesterday and now sits below that level after a 1% daily decline. LINK, HYPE, XLM, TRX, and ADA are also slightly in the red. In contrast, XRP, SOL, BNB, DOGE, and SUI are with insignificant gains. In contrast, M has resumed its massive rally and is up to over $2.5 after another 9% surge. WLFI is up by 8% and sits at $0.22. PUMP has stolen the show with a massive 22% surge daily, which has pushed its price to $0.008. The total crypto market cap, though, has lost around $30 billion since yesterday and is down to $4.160 trillion on CG. Cryptocurrency Market Overview.

In a post on X, he shared how the company’s Return on Investment ( ROI) from Bitcoin, open interest, and its treasury expansion have beaten that of the heavyweights in tech. He even commented, “Bitcoin is more interesting than the Magnificent 7.” Saylor posted a chart comparing open interest to the market cap To illustrate Bitcoin’s impact, Saylor shared a chart comparing open interest to market cap. MicroStrategy came in first at 100.5%, trouncing Tesla’s 26% and the rest of the Magnificent 7, including Nvidia, Meta, Alphabet, Apple, Amazon, and Microsoft. Earlier this month, in a further comparison, Saylor stacked MicroStrategy’s performance against Bitcoin, SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (SPY), Vanguard Real Estate ETF (VNQ), and Vanguard Total Bond Market ETF (BND). This came after the company was excluded from the S&P 500 index. At the time, he also showed a chart on annualized returns with MicroStrategy topping the list at 91%. It outperformed Nvidia’s 72% and Tesla’s 32%. After that came Alphabet, which posted 26% and Meta 23%, with Microsoft, Apple, and Amazon reporting significantly lower numbers. Source: Strategy Responding to Saylor’s post, Thomas Lee of Fundstrat weighed in, arguing that Bitcoin and Ethereum have been more resilient themes than AI or cybersecurity. He likened Strategy to a “granny shot ETF,” to mean it offers investors a simple, accessible path to Bitcoin exposure through traditional markets. As previously reported by Cryptopolitan, investors have been becoming more hopeful of Strategy’s potential inclusion in the S&P 500 , which some consider as a way to acknowledge that the company has won itself international attention. Its omission, though, delays the added visibility and passive inflows that normally accompany such a listing. Strategy has accumulated over 638000 Bitcoin Stock market heroes The Magnificent Seven have had a tough time in 2025, and that’s saying something as their role in stoking stock market gains has been legendary. Apple and Microsoft are working through tighter regulatory scrutiny, Amazon is facing slowing consumer demand, and Tesla is still dealing with increasing competition in electric vehicles. Nvidia remains a bright spot, with demand for AI chips driving revenue even higher, but its stock gains this year have failed to keep up with prior explosive run-ups. Alphabet and Meta, meanwhile, are competing for digital advertising with TikTok and other platforms that are wooing users. Compared to the Magnificent 7, Strategy’s story is cleaner. The company is still adding to its Bitcoin stack. BitcoinTreasuries.NET reported that around 12 firms expanded their holdings in the past week, led by Strategy’s 1,955 BTC buy. Gemini added 1,191 BTC, while Bitdeer in Singapore accumulated 333.5 BTC. Metaplanet (Japan), Cango (China), and Volcon (U.S.) also added to their Bitcoin positions. Meanwhile, steady but smaller allocations came from Smarter Web in the UK, Exodus, Canaan, Anap Holdings, H100 Group, and DigitalX. Data from BitcoinTreasuries.NET shows that the 100 largest public holders collectively control 1,009,202 BTC, worth over $117 billion today. Businesses worldwide, from Asia to Europe to the U.S., are positioning Bitcoin as a strategic part of their balance sheets. So far, Strategy has 638,460 BTC holdings, after the 1955 BTC purchase for approximately $217.4 million at an average price of $111,196. Per executive chairman Saylor, the firm spent around $47.2 billion (fees included) to acquire its Bitcoin holdings at an average price of $73,880 — now worth about $71 billion. Strategy has primarily financed the buys using capital raised through ATM sales of MSTR shares and perpetual preferred issues STRK and STRF. STRD offers the highest risk-reward trade-off, with a 10% non-cumulative dividend. STRK is convertible, paying 8%, and includes equity participation. STRF is non-convertible but pays a secure 10% cumulative dividend. STRC is a variable-rate preferred with monthly distributions pegged near par. Year-to-date, Strategy stock remains one of the Nasdaq’s best-performing stocks as Bitcoin adoption and demand for crypto-based equities continue to increase. Saylor attributes the company’s adoption of the “Bitcoin Standard”, a corporate strategy pursued since 2020, to insulating shareholder value to levels well beyond that seen in traditional tech stocks.

The analyst’s primary expectation is for more gains to follow as the ETH/BTC pair begins to surge. This key relationship is a central focus for the analyst, as a strong performance from Ethereum against BTC often signals a broader bullish period for ETH itself. ETH And ETHBTC Daily Candles Flash Strong Bullish Close Giving a detailed market update, CRYPTOWZRD highlighted that both Ethereum’s daily candle and the ETHBTC pair closed strongly bullish. ETHBTC’s surge occurred as Bitcoin’s dominance weakened, providing altcoins with room to build momentum. This shift marked a significant move for Ethereum, reflecting renewed strength in the broader market structure. Related Reading: Ethereum (ETH) On The Brink Of A Major Supply Crisis: What It Means For Investors According to his analysis, ETHBTC successfully broke out of its daily falling wedge pattern, a move that often signals the start of a bullish reversal. Ethereum mirrored this strength, pushing higher alongside the breakout, which further reinforced optimism among traders who have been watching closely for signs of sustained upside momentum. Examining key levels, CRYPTOWZRD highlighted that $5,000 remains the primary daily resistance for Ethereum. A decisive break above this threshold could ignite an impulsive rally, potentially driving ETH toward the $5,780 resistance zone or even higher. On the downside, $4,000 is seen as the critical daily support, providing a safety net for bulls should price action cool off in the short term. Despite the strong outlook, he noted that his primary focus will stay on the lower time frame chart formations for tomorrow, as these provide opportunities for quick scalps and short-term trades. However, with the weekend approaching, CRYPTOWZRD is maintaining a rational stance. Volatility Offers Both Risk And Opportunity In The Current Setup Crypto analyst CRYPTOWZRD has stated that the intraday chart for Ethereum is showing significant volatility, with more expected in the near term. This high level of fluctuation is something he is prepared for and is a normal part of the market as it searches for a new direction. Related Reading: Ethereum Bulls on the Back Foot – Can Momentum Return Soon? In the meantime, CRYPTOWZRD has outlined two potential scenarios. If BTC’s price pulls back toward the $4,500 level, it will then show a clear bullish reversal. Another scenario would be if Ethereum holds strong and breaks above the $4,765 resistance, it would signal a new upward leg. Ultimately, the analyst advises exercising patience and waiting for the market to present a clear, healthy trade setup.

51695321,https://timestabloid.com/?p=83134,1757829741,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/67/default.png,Here’s What Is Revealed for the First about XRP and Global Banking,https://timestabloid.com/heres-what-is-revealed-for-the-first-about-xrp-and-global-banking/,"Crypto researcher SMQKE has released a detailed presentation outlining what he describes as verifiable proof that XRP is already integrated into the global banking infrastructure. In a tweet, SMQKE emphasized that the evidence presented is not speculative, but fully documented, demonstrating how XRP, through Ripple’s Interledger Protocol (ILP) and ISO 20022 compliance , is embedded in systems that move trillions of dollars daily. A video accompanying the tweet featured both SMQKE and Jesse as they walked through the evidence step by step. XRP’S INTEGRATION INTO THE REGULATED BANKING ECOSYSTEM—POWERED BY ISO 20022 AND RIPPLE’S INTERLEDGER PROTOCOL—REVEALED FOR THE FIRST TIME Not clickbait. This video presents verifiable evidence that XRP is already embedded in the global banking infrastructure that moves… pic.twitter.com/oihhycP0Qj — SMQKE (@SMQKEDQG) September 12, 2025 Evidence of XRP’s Integration In the video, Jesse introduced SMQKE as the lead presenter, highlighting that the research provided the strongest confirmation yet of XRP’s role in the banking system. SMQKE explained that by the end of the session, viewers would have a clear understanding of XRP’s place within regulated finance. He stated that his findings were presented directly from source documents to eliminate speculation. According to the presentation, Ripple’s Interledger Protocol functions as the foundation of this integration. First proposed in 2012, ILP enables interoperability between blockchains and traditional financial ledgers. SMQKE described ILP as essential for banks because it provides transaction scalability, privacy, and interoperability at levels required for institutions that process trillions of dollars per day. He further noted that ILP enables RippleNet, Ripple’s payment network, to operate at scale, with XRP used as the liquidity mechanism. Role of ISO 20022 in Banking Standards The researcher linked Ripple’s ILP with ISO 20022, the international standard for financial messaging that is replacing the older SWIFT system. He explained that ISO 20022 provides a universal language for financial institutions, allowing seamless communication and settlement. According to his findings, XRP is among a small group of ISO 20022-compliant digital assets, making it positioned for integration into global payment systems. SMQKE cited documents from Standard Chartered Bank, which explicitly list XRP as a native ISO 20022 token. The presentation also highlighted that RippleNet and XRP provide banks with faster and cheaper cross-border settlement compared to traditional methods. This compliance with ISO 20022 ensures that banks adopting the new messaging standard can easily connect with Ripple’s infrastructure and leverage XRP for liquidity advantages. International Finance Bank A significant portion of SMQKE’s evidence came from the International Finance Bank (IFB). He demonstrated that IFB has adopted Ripple’s Interledger Protocol as a cornerstone of its cross-ledger strategy. Documents from the bank confirmed that ILP and RippleNet are part of its payment infrastructure, with specific references to XRP liquidity being used when it offers foreign exchange advantages.

SMQKE pointed to IFB’s roadmap, which already lists RippleNet and XRP as operational options for payment pathways. SMQKE stressed that Ripple has already established extensive coverage across the financial sector, with RippleNet reportedly covering 90 percent of the global foreign exchange market and partnerships with over 100 banks. This widespread adoption, he argued, positions XRP to serve as a bridge asset once its market capitalization and liquidity reach sufficient levels. He concluded by stating that XRP integration into ISO 20022-compliant pipelines is a long-term strategy to address liquidity challenges in the banking system. Once XRP’s market cap is high enough, banks could rely on it as an on-demand liquidity solution for cross-border payments. SMQKE maintained that this evidence shows a direct pathway for XRP’s usage within the global financial system, fully aligned with regulatory standards and supported by established banking institutions.

The price of DOGE now sits close to $0.296, up from $0.21 earlier this month, as traders point to strong technical and onchain signals suggesting further growth. Bullish Technical Breakout On the weekly chart, Dogecoin has broken out of a multimonth symmetrical triangle, a continuation pattern that typically signals further upside. Trading volumes surged during the breakout, more than tripling compared to average levels, indicating strong momentum behind the move. Chart projections suggest Dogecoin could rise as high as $0.60, a gain of about 95% from current levels, by October. Some analysts, including CryptoKing and CryptoGoos, have issued more conservative targets near $0.45, which aligns with resistance from a broader multiyear triangle. Key Support Levels to Watch Dogecoin’s relative strength index (RSI) remains below the overbought threshold of 70, giving bulls further room to push higher. Still, traders warn that DOGE must hold above its 50-week exponential moving average, currently near $0.227, to sustain the bullish setup. A decisive drop below this level could trigger a deeper correction toward the 200-week EMA around $0.215. Signs of More Growth Potential Beyond technical patterns, onchain indicators point to additional upside. Dogecoin’s MVRV Z-Score, which measures whether an asset is over- or undervalued compared to historical holder costs, currently sits at 1.35. In past cycles, similar readings have preceded major rallies, including last November’s 230% surge. By contrast, extreme highs — such as the Z-Score exceeding 20 during DOGE’s all-time peak near $0.70 in 2021 — signaled overheated conditions. The modest current reading suggests that investors are not sitting on excessive unrealized profits, leaving more room for price appreciation. Can Dogecoin Repeat Historic Rallies? With momentum building, comparisons are being made to past explosive moves, particularly last year’s triple-digit surge. Analysts say the current setup leaves open the possibility of another significant rally if key supports hold and broader crypto sentiment remains positive. While risks remain — including sudden market corrections and broader macroeconomic factors — Dogecoin’s breakout has strengthened the case for further gains in the coming weeks.",Crypto News Today|Crypto Intelligence,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|DOGE|TRADING|MARKET|BUSINESS,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2025-09-14 06:15:37

Ripple CEO Just Went Nuclear,https://timestabloid.com/xrps-943-scenario-ripple-ceo-just-went-nuclear/,"Crypto enthusiast Diana shared a tweet highlighting a projection attributed to Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse. In the tweet, Garlinghouse is said to have outlined that XRP could capture 14 percent of SWIFT’s annual flows within the next five years. SWIFT, according to the tweet, facilitates around $1.5 quadrillion in transactions annually, and 14 percent of that figure would amount to approximately $210 trillion. The tweet reveals the magnitude of the number by placing it against the United States’ gross domestic product, which stands at $27 trillion. The post says the outcome would mark a fundamental change in global money movement. XRP’S $943 SCENARIO? BRAD GARLINGHOUSE JUST WENT NUCLEAR Ripple’s CEO dropped one of the boldest projections we’ve ever heard: XRP could capture 14% of SWIFT’s $1.5 quadrillion flows within 5 years. If true, this isn’t just bullish. It’s historic. Let’s unpack pic.twitter.com/h9nGntK9Ng — Diana (@InvestWithD) September 12, 2025 Liquidity demands and valuation scenarios The tweet explained that if even a fraction of these projected flows were directed into XRP liquidity pools, the resulting demand would transform the way price discovery occurs for the asset. Rather than being driven by speculative retail cycles, the post suggested that institutional flows could produce valuations far beyond previous peaks. Diana’s tweet introduced various scenarios to illustrate this. A conservative approach, assuming only 1 percent of global flows, was paired with a calculation that suggested a value of around $96 per XRP. Another more aggressive scenario, using an assumed effective float of 5.6 billion XRP, produced an estimate of $943 per token. The tweet presented these figures as outcomes of arithmetic rather than speculative hype, pointing to the scale of the capital involved. Market infrastructure and adoption drivers Diana’s post also pointed to areas beyond SWIFT where XRP’s potential utility is being considered. The tweet mentioned the Depository Trust & Clearing Corporation, which handles settlements valued at approximately $3 quadrillion, global banking deposits across the United States and Japan worth $37.5 trillion, and annual payments processed by Visa, Mastercard, and American Express totalling $26 trillion. The tweet further noted that tokenization is a growing sector expected to represent trillions in value over the coming decade. By highlighting these institutions and markets, the tweet suggested that XRP is positioned as a settlement layer extending into multiple financial systems, beyond traditional cross-border payments. Timelines and institutional context According to the tweet, Garlinghouse’s statement that XRP could achieve this level of integration within five years should not be viewed as an offhand remark. Instead, the post suggested it reflects Ripple’s outlook on accelerating adoption timelines. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 It linked this to trends such as the tokenization of real-world assets, the growth of stablecoins, the creation of exchange-traded funds, and the development of central bank digital currencies. In this framing, XRP was described not simply as a payments solution but as infrastructure for broader institutional settlement. The tweet concluded with an emphasis on what these figures could mean for XRP holders. Even marginal market penetration was presented as potentially significant, with examples showing that a 0.1% share of global flows could imply a valuation of around $9.6 per token A 1 percent share would translate to approximately $96, while the projected 14 percent capture of SWIFT flows would imply a scenario in the hundreds of dollars per token. Diana noted that the issue is not one of speculative hype but rather of whether regulatory frameworks, banking systems, and financial networks align quickly enough to enable such levels of adoption.

The market is completely underestimating the likelihood of such an announcement,” Thorn said. The US recently made a statement about establishing a reserve but announced that it would not actively purchase BTC. Although some industry executives are more cautious about the possibility, there are signs that the plan is moving forward. US President Donald Trump signed an executive order in March formalizing the establishment of the Strategic Bitcoin Reserve and the US Digital Asset Reserve. However, the strategic plan for implementing the reserve has not yet been finalized. Related News: Morgan Stanley and Deutsche Bank Predict How Much the Fed Will Cut Interest Rates Recent developments suggest the process is ongoing. On Tuesday, US lawmakers introduced a bill to the Treasury Department that would require the preparation of a report on the feasibility and technical requirements of a strategic Bitcoin reserve.

The chart presents a falling wedge pattern that began forming in late July. This type of pattern often signals a period of consolidation followed by a potential breakout when price action moves beyond the upper trendline. In this instance, the price of XRP appears to have broken above the descending resistance line in early September, creating interest around the first potential upside target displayed on the chart. #XRP short-term price target pic.twitter.com/69cYea3Wgi — STEPH IS CRYPTO (@Steph_iscrypto) September 13, 2025 The Falling Wedge Pattern XRP’s price action displayed strong upward momentum, reaching an all-time high of $3.65 in July before entering the consolidation phase visible on the chart. This phase reached its lowest point in early September when the asset fell to $2.71. This move marked the deepest retest of the wedge’s lower boundary. However, XRP’s trajectory shifted shortly after, with a swift climb to regain the $3 support level . This surge pushed XRP out of the falling wedge, breaking above the descending upper line, which typically signals that buyers are gaining control, especially when accompanied by increased volume or sustained higher lows. XRP’s Next Target The analyst’s chart identifies $3.6389 as the first level, which sits about 16.85% above the current price. This figure is explicitly marked on the chart with an upward green arrow, indicating where the price could advance if the breakout continues. This would place the digital asset just below its all-time high, with a chance that the breakout could continue and push XRP into a price discovery phase . We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 What This Means for Market Participants For traders who follow technical analysis, a breakout from a falling wedge can indicate an early stage of a bullish trend reversal or continuation. The 4-hour chart shows how price compression within the wedge pattern created a buildup that now appears to be resolving upward. If XRP maintains its breakout trajectory, the price level of $3.6389 becomes a logical first checkpoint. The chart does not provide further targets beyond the $3.6389 mark. However, in technical analysis, once a resistance level is broken, market participants often watch for continuation patterns or new consolidation zones to form. Meanwhile, XRP’s tendency to move quickly could help it reach new levels sooner than expected. Disclaimer : This content is meant to inform and should not be considered financial advice.

We Asked 3 AI Models,https://cryptopotato.com/can-ripples-xrp-smash-through-5-in-2025-we-asked-3-ai-models/,"TL;DR Three of the most popular AI solutions share their take on whether Ripple’s native token has the legs for another mind-blowing rally this year that will take it above $5. Here are their answers, and some of them might be quite surprising. 2024/2025 Quick Recap 2025 will go down in history as one of the most eventful years in the relatively short period of cryptocurrency existence. Ripple’s native token is no exception, as it should receive a prime spot in that ranking (after all, it has become the third-largest digital asset by market cap). The asset did what many thought was impossible just a year ago. It skyrocketed from under $0.6 this time last year to a new all-time high of $3.65 marked in July 2025. As such, it finally broke its previous record, which was set in January 2018. Yet, it lost some traction in the following couple of months and has just recently reclaimed the coveted $3 resistance (which acts as support once again). So, the question is whether it has given its all this year, or it still has some fuel in the tank for another rally, this time to and beyond $5. Let’s examine what ChatGPT, Gemini, and Grok had to say about this. The Bull Case OpenAI’s solution started with its bullish case, which envisions a price pump to the aforementioned target and even slightly above it, should the asset reclaim the $3.40 – $3.50 resistance. That’s from a technical standpoint. News propellers that could send XRP flying would be the potential approval of spot Ripple ETFs in the US. Although the regulator responsible for approving or denying these filings continues to delay making a decision, the overall odds, according to experts and Polymarket, are above 90% for this year. If greenlighted, the XRP ETFs can help legitimize the underlying token and enhance its institutional adoption, said ChatGPT. Grok listed the following factors that could help XRP achieve the $5 goal, some of which were identical to the ones from its OpenAI rival: p]:pt-0 [&>p]:mb-2 [&>p]:my-0""> Regulatory clarity, especially regarding SEC-ETF decisions, could be a catalyst. p]:pt-0 [&>p]:mb-2 [&>p]:my-0""> Ripple’s continued expansion in cross-border payments and banking partnerships. p]:pt-0 [&>p]:mb-2 [&>p]:my-0""> Institutional investment inflows and potential ETF approvals. p]:pt-0 [&>p]:mb-2 [&>p]:my-0""> Technical signals like breaking resistance levels around $3.09 to $3.60. p]:pt-0 [&>p]:mb-2 [&>p]:my-0""> Introduction of other products like Ripple’s RLUSD stablecoin. Gemini was a bit more conservative, indicating that such a 65% surge to $5 in the next three and a half months would require a combination of factors, including significant fresh capital and several positive catalysts to occur. Not-So-Bullish Case ChatGPT warned that XRP might have given everything it had in 2025 and listed potential drawbacks that could hinder its growth potential. Weak On-Chain Metrics: XRP Ledger’s DeFi activity remains muted, with TVL under $100 million and trading volumes sharply down since mid-summer. Exchange Reserves Rising: Binance’s XRP holdings recently hit a record, signaling possible sell pressure if markets turn risk-off. Macro Environment: If global liquidity tightens or Bitcoin consolidates, XRP could stay range-bound between $2.70 and $3.20 for the rest of 2025. Gemini added that longer periods of correction and consolidation are rather natural after such explosive rallies, like the one XRP experienced from November 2024 to July 2025 (with small deviations). “XRP’s smashing through $5 in 2025 is seen as an achievable but optimistic scenario by several experts, with the more conservative outlooks pointing to prices below $4 for most of the year,” concluded Grok.

The recent negative tone of the economic data points from last week raised expectations that the Federal Reserve will cut interest rates on Wednesday, making riskier assets such as stocks and bitcoin more attractive. Let's recap the data that backs up that thesis. The most important one, the U.S. CPI figures , came out on Thursday. The headline rate was slightly higher than expected, a sign inflation might be stickier than anticipated. Before that, we had Tuesday's revisions to job data. The world's largest economy created almost 1 million fewer jobs than reported in the year ended March, the largest downward revision in the country's history. The figures followed the much-watched monthly jobs report, which was released the previous Friday. The U.S. added just 22,000 jobs in August, with unemployment rising to 4.3%, the Bureau of Labor Statistics said. Initial jobless claims rose 27,000 to 263,000 — the highest since October 2021. Higher inflation and fewer jobs are not great for the U.S. economy, so it's no surprise that the word ""stagflation"" is starting to creep back into macroeconomic commentary. Against this backdrop, bitcoin—considered a risk asset by Wall Street—continued grinding higher, topping $116,000 on Friday and almost closing the CME futures gap at 117,300 from August. Not a surprise, as traders are also bidding up the biggest risk assets: equities. Just take a look at the S&P 500 index, which closed at a record for the second day on the hope of a rate cut. So how should traders think about BTC's price chart? To this chart enthusiast, price action remains constructive, with higher lows forming from the September bottom of $107,500. The 200-day moving average has climbed to $102,083, while the Short-Term Holder Realized Price — often used as support in bull markets — rose to a record $109,668. Bitcoin-linked stocks: A mixed bag However, bitcoin's weekly positive price action didn't help Strategy (MSTR), the largest of the bitcoin treasury companies, whose shares were about flat for the week. Its rivals performed better: MARA Holdings (MARA) 7% and XXI (CEP) 4%. Strategy (MSTR) has underperformed bitcoin year-to-date and continues to hover below its 200-day moving average, currently $355. At Thursday's close of $326, it's testing a key long-term support level seen back in September 2024 and April 2025. The company’s mNAV premium has compressed to below 1.5x when accounting for outstanding convertible debt and preferred stock, or roughly 1.3x based solely on equity value. Preferred stock issuance remains muted, with only $17 million tapped across STRK and STRF this week, meaning that the bulk of at-the-money issuance is still flowing through common shares . According to the company , options are now listed and trading for all four perpetual preferred stocks, a development that could provide additional yield on the dividend. Bullish catalysts for crypto stocks? The CME's FedWatch tool shows traders expect a 25 basis-point U.S. interest-rate cut in September and have priced in a total of three rate cuts by year-end. That's a sign risk sentiment could tilt back toward growth and crypto-linked equities, underlined by the 10-year U.S. Treasury briefly breaking below 4% this week. Still, the dollar index (DXY) continues to hold multiyear support, a potential inflection point worth watching.",Markets|Bitcoin|Inflation|News,EN,0,0,MACROECONOMICS|CRYPTOCURRENCY|TRADING|BTC|MARKET,"{'name': 'CoinDesk', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/5/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coindesk,2025-09-14 08:00:00

Now, the storm has settled, and capital is flowing back into crypto investment products. The Bitcoin ETFs seem to be back enjoying the attention of US investors in the month of September, as seen with some significant performances over the past two weeks. The past week was particularly impressive, as the Bitcoin funds recorded no single outflow day. Bitcoin ETFs Close Week With $642-M Inflow According to the latest market data , the US-based Bitcoin ETFs posted a total net inflow of $642.35 million on Friday, September 12. This single-day performance marked the fifth consecutive day of positive capital influx for the exchange-traded funds. Surprisingly, Fidelity Wise Origin Bitcoin Fund (with the ticker FBTC) led the pack on Friday, closing the week with a net inflow of over $315 million. Meanwhile, BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (with the ticker IBIT) came in second with a daily net inflow of $264.71 million on Friday. This impressive daily performance pushed the largest Bitcoin exchange-traded fund closer to reaching a net assets valuation of $90 billion. Bitwise Bitcoin ETF (BITB) with a $29.16 million net inflow and ARK 21Shares Bitcoin ETF (ARKB) with a $19.37 million net inflow also added value in double digits on Friday. Grayscale Bitcoin Mini Trust (BTC) and VanEck Bitcoin ETF (HODL) were the only Bitcoin ETFs that recorded any activity, with $5.69 million and $8.24 million, respectively, on the day. As inferred earlier, Friday’s $642-million performance was only the latest in a line of strong performances by the US-based Bitcoin ETFs. The latest market data shows that the BTC exchange-traded funds added $2.34 billion in value over the past week. This past week’s performance represents the first time that the Bitcoin ETFs would be crossing the billion-dollar mark on the inflow chart. Also, the BTC-linked investment products outperformed the US Ethereum ETF market, which closed the week with a net weekly inflow of $637.69. Bitcoin Price At A Glance This positive performance of the spot Bitcoin ETFs is a reflection of the resurgence that the BTC price went through over the past week. According to data from CoinGecko, the premier cryptocurrency is up by more than 5%. As of this writing, Bitcoin is valued at around $115,990, with no substantial price change in the past 24 hours.",ETF|bitcoin|bitcoin news|bitcoin price|btc|BTCUSDT|Ethereum ETFs|Spot Bitcoin ETFs,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|TRADING,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-09-14 08:00:07

This choppy price action has raised doubts about the flagship cryptocurrency’s potential to resume its bull run and reach a new all-time high price. A crypto expert on social media platform X has come forward with an interesting outlook for the Bitcoin price, stating that the market leader could be gearing up for its next explosive move. However, the on-chain analyst added that a certain condition must be met for BTC to resume its uptrend. A Break Above $118,000 Could Precede Price Explosion: Analyst In a September 13 post on X, Alphractal founder and CEO Joao Wedson revealed that the price of Bitcoin could be preparing for an extended rally over the next few weeks. The on-chain data expert shared that the premier cryptocurrency will need a convincing break above the $118,000 level to confirm the resumption of the bull run. Related Reading: Analyst Sets Bold $1,314 Target For Solana After Cup-And-Handle Breakout Wedson noted in his post that $117,000 is actually the price mark to watch out for, as it represents a zone of strong interest and indecision. Specifically, two on-chain indicators—the CVDD Channel and the Fibonacci-Adjusted Market Mean Price—have designated this price level as a point where the market is likely to slow down or form a local top. According to analytics platform Alphractal, the CVDD Channel is a metric that estimates historical price floors and risk zones based on the coin destruction data and Fibonacci envelopes. Meanwhile, the Fibonacci-Adjusted Market Mean Price combines the market mean price with Fibonacci bands to identify structural expansion and value zones. Wedson highlighted that both the CVDD Channel and the Fibonacci-Adjusted Market Mean Price have revealed “eerily accurate levels” of support and resistance throughout Bitcoin’s price history. Currently, these metrics are pointing to $117,000 as a level that could provide resistance to the upward movement of the Bitcoin price. In the end, Wedson concluded that this zone could be critical to the market leader’s next move to the upside. However, the Alphractal founder advised Bitcoin investors to wait for a clear, sustained breakout above $118,000 to confirm that bullish momentum is back. Bitcoin Price At A Glance As of this writing, the price of BTC stands at around $115,905, reflecting no significant change in the past 24 hours.

In a recent post, CW wrote, “Remember that the real rally for $XRP comes after the ATH breakout. It’s getting closer.” The statement underscores the view that the asset’s strongest phase of upward momentum would only begin once historical resistance levels are broken. Remember that the real rally for $XRP comes after the ATH breakout. It's getting closer. https://t.co/8zO727jGEl pic.twitter.com/Xff4uXprmD — CW (@CW8900) September 13, 2025 Chart Analysis and Market Phases Alongside CW’s remarks, a chart was shared showing XRP’s price history segmented into distinct phases. The chart presents a comparison between past and current market cycles, highlighting repeating patterns over time. According to the illustration, XRP has historically moved through phases of accumulation, consolidation, and breakout before reaching new highs. The chart outlines four primary phases. The initial stage is followed by a corrective phase where the price consolidates within a downward structure. This is then succeeded by a sideways trading phase, which transitions into a breakout phase marked by accelerated price movement. Within the current structure, the chart places XRP in a stage preceding a major breakout, with emphasis on the potential for gains once the all-time high level is surpassed. The image also identifies two potential target levels. The first is the prior all-time high, which would serve as an initial breakout confirmation. The second, marked as TP2, is projected using the Fibonacci extension level of 6.618, suggesting a possible target in the region of $21.5. The comparison to earlier cycles, particularly the 2017 breakout, is used to illustrate how similar technical structures previously led to significant increases in price. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Current Market Conditions At the time of the chart’s capture, XRP was trading above $3, showing an increase of more than 10 percent within the session. The visual also highlights volume activity, which historically accompanied breakout movements in past cycles. Observers within the XRP community have noted that price consolidation within structured patterns has often preceded larger directional moves, and CW’s commentary reinforces this interpretation by emphasizing the role of the all-time high as a pivotal level. CW’s analysis and the accompanying chart reiterate the perspective that XRP’s market trajectory remains dependent on surpassing its historical peak. The outlined phases and technical targets provide a structured interpretation of how previous cycles unfolded, with implications that similar dynamics could apply again. While near-term volatility remains a factor, the emphasis on the all-time high breakout positions it as a critical milestone for the asset’s next major rally .

Once known for its vast fleets of bitcoin mining rigs, the company is now part of a growing trend: converting energy-intensive mining operations into high-performance AI facilities. Bitcoin miners like Core, Hut 8 (HUT) and TeraWulf (WULF) are swapping ASIC machines — the dedicated bitcoin mining computer — for GPU clusters, driven by the lure of AI’s explosive growth and the harsh economics of crypto mining. Power play It's no secret that bitcoin mining requires an extensive amount of energy, which is the biggest cost of minting a new digital asset. Back in the 2021 bull run, when the Bitcoin network's hashrate and difficulty were low, miners were making out like bandits with margins as much as 90%. Then came the brutal crypto winter and the halving event, which slashed the mining reward in half. In 2025, with surging hashrate and energy prices, miners are now struggling to survive with razor-thin margins. However, the need for power—the biggest input cost—became a blessing in disguise for these miners, who needed a different strategy to diversify their revenue sources. Due to rising competition for mining, the miners continued to procure more machines to stay afloat, and with it came the need for more megawatts of electricity at a cheaper price. Miners invested heavily in securing these low-cost energy sources, such as hydroelectric or stranded natural gas sites, and developed expertise in managing high-density cooling and electrical systems—skills honed during the crypto boom of the early 2020s. This is what captured the attention of AI and cloud computing firms. While bitcoin relies on specialized ASICs, AI thrives on versatile GPUs like Nvidia's H100 series, which require similar high-power environments but for parallel processing tasks in machine learning. Instead of building out data centers from scratch, taking over mining infrastructure, which already has power ready, became a faster way to grow an increasing appetite for AI-related infrastructure. Essentially, these miners aren’t just pivoting—they’re retrofitting. The cooling systems, low-cost energy contracts, and power-dense infrastructure they built during the crypto boom now serve a new purpose: feeding the AI models of companies like OpenAI and Google. Firms like Crusoe Energy sold off mining assets to focus solely on AI, deploying GPU clusters in remote, energy-rich locations that mirror the decentralized ethos of crypto but now fuel centralized AI hyperscalers. Terraforming AI Bitcoin mining has effectively ""terraformed"" the terrain for AI compute by building out scalable, power-efficient infrastructure that AI desperately needs. As Nicholas Gregory, Board Director at Fragrant Prosperity, noted, ""It can be argued bitcoin paved the way for digital dollar payments as can be seen with USDT/Tether. It also looks like bitcoin terraformed data centres for AI/GPU compute."" This pre-existing ""terraforming"" allows miners to retrofit facilities quickly, often in under a year, compared to the multi-year timelines for traditional data center builds. Firms like Crusoe Energy sold off mining assets to focus solely on AI, deploying GPU clusters in remote, energy-rich locations that mirror the decentralized ethos of crypto but now fuel centralized AI hyperscalers. Higher returns In practice, it means miners can flip a facility in less than a year—far faster than the multi-year timeline of a new data center. But AI isn’t a cheap upgrade. Bitcoin mining setups are relatively modest, with costs ranging from $300,000 to $800,000 per megawatt (MW) excluding ASICs, allowing for quick scalability in response to market cycles. Meanwhile, AI infrastructure demands significantly higher capex due to the need for advanced liquid cooling, redundant power systems, and the GPUs themselves, which can cost tens of thousands per unit and face global supply shortages. Despite the steeper upfront costs, AI offers miners up to 25 times more revenue per kilowatt-hour than bitcoin mining, making the pivot economically compelling amid rising energy prices and declining crypto profitability. A niche industry worth billions As AI continues to surge and crypto profits tighten, bitcoin mining could become a niche game—one reserved for energy-rich regions or highly efficient players, especially as the next in 2028 could render many operations unprofitable without breakthroughs in efficiency or energy costs. While projections show the global crypto mining market growing to $3.3 billion by 2030, at a modest 6.9% CAGR, the billions would be overshadowed by AI's exponential expansion. According to KBV Research , the global AI in mining market is projected to reach $435.94 billion by 2032, expanding at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 40.6%. With investors already seeing dollar signs in this shift, the broader trend suggests the future is either a hybrid or a full conversion to AI, where stable contracts with hyperscalers promise longevity over crypto's boom-bust cycles.

Details",https://timestabloid.com/market-strategist-says-xrp-to-1000-is-inevitable-but-when-details/,"XRP has recently faced selling pressure after rallying to its yearly high of $3.66. The asset has since corrected to the $3.00 range in line with broader market weakness. While short-term conditions appear uncertain, some analysts continue to highlight the cryptocurrency’s long-term potential. Armando Pantoja, a well-known crypto investor and commentator, recently reaffirmed his view that XRP could eventually reach $1,000 . According to him, the target is realistic over a long period, although unlikely to materialize in the immediate future. His remarks came as a counterpoint to more aggressive projections in the market. $XRP will eventually hit $1,000 but not tomorrow and not soon. $BTC took 8 years to sustain above $1,000. The lawsuit held #XRP down, it's like we are starting from scratch. But hey, I'll wait 10+ years for a 33,233% return. Repost if you agree — Armando Pantoja (@_TallGuyTycoon) July 25, 2025 For example, Jake Claver of Digital Ascension Group has suggested XRP could rise to between $1,500 and $2,000 by early 2026. Pantoja disagrees with this timeframe, stating that XRP will require significantly more time to achieve even the $1,000 threshold. Comparing XRP’s Path to Bitcoin’s Growth To support his stance, Pantoja pointed to Bitcoin’s historical trajectory. Bitcoin first crossed $1,000 in November 2013, approximately four years after its launch. However, it failed to sustain this milestone and required another three years to establish itself above the level in 2017. Altogether, it took eight years from inception for Bitcoin to hold that price region decisively. Drawing from this history, Pantoja argued that XRP could experience a similar pattern. Yet, he acknowledged that the comparison highlights certain challenges. Unlike Bitcoin, the first and largest cryptocurrency, XRP has already been in existence for 13 years without reaching a comparable valuation. Impact of Legal Proceedings Pantoja attributed part of XRP’s delayed performance to the regulatory uncertainty surrounding its ongoing legal dispute with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. The case, which began in December 2020, disrupted investor confidence and delayed adoption. With the matter now nearing resolution, Pantoja believes the project may be able to restart its trajectory under more favourable conditions. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 He suggested that once legal risks are behind it, XRP could follow a growth path similar to what Bitcoin achieved in its first decade. Based on this reasoning, Pantoja estimated that XRP might take around eight additional years to reach the $1,000 mark , setting a tentative timeframe between 2033 and 2035. Long-Term Returns for Patient Investors At the current market price of about $3.10, XRP would need to appreciate roughly 3,100% to reach $1,000. While such a gain appears extraordinary, Pantoja emphasized that long-term investors willing to wait could still find the prospect attractive. In his view, a potential return of more than 30,000% over the course of a decade justifies optimism, provided investors understand the risks and extended timeline involved. Although XRP’s immediate outlook reflects volatility and legal uncertainty, analysts like Armando Pantoja maintain that its long-term prospects remain strong. He expects eventual growth toward $1,000, but not within the rapid timelines suggested by some market commentators. Instead, his analysis underscores the importance of patience, suggesting that XRP’s climb to four-digit territory may not occur until the mid-2030s.

In his statement, Yongli argued that stablecoins are neither indispensable nor substitutable for the functioning of the on-chain crypto world. According to Yongli, stablecoin regulations will inevitably trigger regulation of the entire crypto asset class, which could have profound market impacts. However, they also carry the risk of negative consequences for stablecoins. Related News: Morgan Stanley and Deutsche Bank Predict How Much the Fed Will Cut Interest Rates Yongli argued that China should be more deliberate and proactive in this process, saying the country's focus should not be on developing a RMB-based stablecoin. Instead, he argued that all cryptoasset laws should be swiftly implemented, banks and other financial institutions should be encouraged to transition to blockchain, the development of real-world assets (RWA) should be actively supported, and cryptocurrency exchanges should be registered in Hong Kong to accelerate the on-chain operation of the RMB. *This is not investment advice.

This could push XRP into a new phase of institutional demand just as PayFi altcoins, Remittix (RTX) included, are gearing up for big moves. As XRP eyes regulatory clarity and potential ETF status, Remittix is delivering utility, rewards, and real momentum. Ripple (XRP) Poised For ETF Surge Ripple’s legal battle with the SEC officially ended recently, removing a key obstacle to ETF filings. With that clarity, several analysts believe BlackRock could submit for a spot XRP ETF in early 2026. Currently, XRP trades at $3.16, facing resistance near $3.40, a crucial technical level. Meanwhile, sentiment is rising, prediction markets and ETF experts are placing approval odds above 80% to 90 % for spot XRP ETFs. Remittix (RTX) Showing Strong PayFi Altcoin Momentum Remittix’s comparison to XRP now matters, while XRP is a top-established token benefiting from legal certainty and ETF speculation, Remittix is still at an earlier stage, but moving fast in the PayFi space. Remittix matches growing interest in real utility beyond speculation, and may offer a sharper growth curve if it scales quickly relative to XRP’s continuing structural developments. The numbers speak loudly. Remittix has sold over 661 million tokens, is presently priced at $0.108, and has raised over $25.5 million. These metrics give RTX a strong foundation in fundraising and market validation. Remittix has already secured its first centralized exchange listing on BitMart after crossing $20 million in funding, followed by LBANK after passing $22 million, and is preparing a third. Here are some of what give Remittix a real edge: Mass market appeal beyond crypto insiders The wallet beta launches in Q3 2025 Users can send crypto to bank accounts in over 30 countries The project is audited by CertiK, which builds trust and transparency Built for adoption, not speculation Remittix is not just riding the hype; it is delivering features and infrastructure. While XRP may benefit from ETF inflows and regulatory clearing, Remittix is also delivering real product and reward mechanics now, making it a standout among PayFi altcoins. What This Means For XRP And PayFi Altcoins BlackRock filing for a spot XRP ETF in early 2026 looks more than speculative; it may become a reality now that regulatory issues are largely resolved. XRP stands to gain from broad institutional exposure, while Remittix is set to surge as it offers a growing ecosystem, wallet beta launch on September 15, a 15% USDT referral program you can claim daily, and a $250,000 giveaway that motivates its community. These twin tracks, XRP’s ETF potential and Remittix’s utility and incentives, suggest that PayFi altcoins are not just waiting in the wings; they are stepping into the spotlight.

According to the platform, it negotiated with the attacker, securing the return of 185 ETH through an Ethereum transaction. In an earlier alert, the platform told its users and the general public on blogging platform X about the potential exploit that may be affecting users connected to Kame. As a precaution, it urged users who still had funds connected to Kame to revoke approval immediately till the issue was sorted. “We sincerely apologize for the inconvenience and are working closely with the team to identify and resolve the issue as quickly as possible. We will share updates as soon as we have more information,” the decentralized aggregator said. Kame aggregator recovers part of its stolen funds Later in the day, it released a follow-up report urging its users to revoke token approvals to two of its contracts, noting that the investigation was still ongoing. While investigations were still ongoing, Kame aggregator said it was important that users carry out the instructions, with the platform dropping a list of steps that they could undertake to revoke the approval. “This step is critical to ensure the safety of your assets. We will provide further updates as soon as possible,” it said. In an updated post by one of the developers, the post stated it has placed multiple bounties to track the exploiter and, coordinated with partners to get their support. The developer said they were also in contact with the hacker via DM on Blockscan, negotiating to have a portion of the stolen funds returned, while still working on further negotiations. “Our current priority remains to mitigate damage, recover funds, and strengthen security moving forward,” the developer said. Critical Update! We have successfully communicated with hackers and they accepted our offer to transfer funds back. 185 ETH has been refunded by this transation https://t.co/SFWD6JJV7K We are collecting information about affected hackers and will soon inform the compensate plan.… — Kame Aggregator (@kame_agg) September 13, 2025 After direct communications with the attacker, Kame acknowledged that about 185 ETH had been transferred by the attacker into a recovery wallet. The exact size of the exploit is yet to be determined, but the platform has promised a full review into the issue in order to determine the total losses. The team also mentioned that it is looking into compensation packages for users impacted by the breach. Promise of compensation amid rise in hacks in 2025 The framework is expected to be published after the investigators are done auditing the wallet data. Until then, users have been advised to disable token approvals following the laid-down steps and wait for updates concerning security protocols. In addition, the team also noted that the recovery was achieved in a collaborative effort with partners from the Sei community. The recovery came at a time when Ethereum posted a slight 5% gain despite registering a decline for the month. Since the beginning of the year, there has been a major uptick in hacks and criminal thefts in the crypto market. As previously reported by Cryptopolitan, the latest analysis from blockchain security firm PeckShield showed that crypto hacks and exploits went up by 15% from July. The security report showed that more than $163 million was stolen across 16 different incidents. The report noted the incidents of Btc Turk, ODIN.fun, BetterBank, and CrediX Finance are the highlights of the month. On August 14, cybersecurity firm Cyvers noted unusual activities involving Ethereum and other tokens on different blockchains. The Cyvers systems flagged large transactions on Ethereum, Arbitrum, Base, Optimism, Polygon, Avalanche, and Mantle. “Our system detected multiple alerts across ETH, AVAX, ARB, BASE, OP, MANTLE, and MATIC networks,” the company reported. About 20 minutes later, Btc Turk paused deposits and withdrawals, noting technical issues with its hot wallet. According to Cyvers, $48 million worth of Ethereum was stolen.

By 2031, BTC might touch $350,548 following increased institutional adoption. Since the beginning of 2024, Bitcoin’s price has doubled, but it has seen a notable 45% increase in just the two weeks following the presidential election. This boost has solidified Bitcoin’s role in the so-called “Trump trade,” with the president-elect’s positive stance on the cryptocurrency industry fueling investor optimism about this emerging asset class. As Bitcoin’s on-chain activities surge, questions arise, such as: “Does Bitcoin have the potential to hold above the $100K mark?” or “Will Bitcoin go up?” or “Where will Bitcoin be in 5 years?” Let’s answer them using our Bitcoin price prediction.

Is Bitcoin a good investment? The rising institutional demand for Bitcoin etfs makes it a good investment option in the crypto market. However, Bitcoin has a short investment history filled with very volatile market value. Whether it is a good investment depends on your financial profile, investment portfolio, risk tolerance, and investment goals. It is suggested to conduct investment advice of the financial markets and understand the financial system risks. Why is Bitcoin up today? Bitcoin faced a surge in buying demand as buyers pushed the price above Fib levels. The recent lows triggered strong accumulation. Will the BTC price reach $100K? Bitcoin price broke its much-anticipated mark of $100K, aiming for a new ATH. The price currently prepares to maintain its buying demand above $120K. Will BTC reach $1 million? $1 million is a significant milestone for the BTC price. However, it is achievable if Bitcoin continues to attract institutional interest in the coming years. Is Bitcoin a good long-term investment? As several institutions continue to accumulate BTC and Bitcoin faces a rise in global recognition, Bitcoin has a solid long-term future. Recent news/opinions on BTC As reported by Cryptopolitan, Metaplanet has purchased 136 Bitcoin worth around 2.251 billion yen as part of its continued Bitcoin Treasury strategy. https://twitter.com/Metaplanet_JP/status/1964887196458275049 Bitcoin price prediction September 2025 Bitcoin’s price jumped to $125,000, making August its best month in 2025. This rise is partly because, in the past, Bitcoin has often grown a lot after its “halving” events. Analysts think the current market is following the same pattern, which could mean we’ll see a peak around September 2025. Bitcoin’s price might attempt to maintain an average price of $111,000 and be pushed further, at least $118,000 if strong downward pressures are not seen. However, we might see a rejection on the bearish side, leading to a consolidation at around $105,000. Bitcoin Price Prediction Potential Low Potential Average Potential High Bitcoin Price Prediction September 2025 $105,000 $111,000 $118,000 Bitcoin price prediction 2025 Historically, Bitcoin has been a significant crypto coin in the year following a halving, and it is expected to push up its price. Bitcoin miners might play a crucial role in holding bullish sentiment for future price movements. Spot Bitcoin ETFs are projected to be a key driver of Bitcoin prices and the broader cryptocurrency market in 2025. As a result, Bitcoin’s trajectory might follow a bullish trend ahead with rising treasury term premium. Furthermore, there is an increasing bullish sentiment that the base interest rates could be cut in the US, and thus, help to further the upward movement of Bitcoin . An outcome of which the 2025 year could be positive for Bitcoin, with its crypto-price perhaps touching $160,000 at the highest and the low could be around $68,000.

However, more financial products including a surge in ETF flows might hold BTC prices within a bullish region. The digital assets market sentiment shows bullish signals for Bitcoin hit new highs. As the overall sentiment gives a bullish outlook, one should research more about Bitcoin before investing. We might see a maximum price of $185,000, with a minimum price of $115,000 and average price of $130,000. However, BitMEX CEO Arthur Hayes predicted the BTC price to touch $700K in 2026.

Cryptopolitan’s Bitcoin (BTC) Price Prediction A surge in bitcoin adoption and the expansion of the Bitcoin ecosystem might end the controversy of “Bitcoin bubble” in future. This might boost the Bitcoin cost and strengthen the Bitcoin network. At Cryptopolitan, we are bullish on Bitcoin’s future price as the historical market sentiment is extremely impressive. By the end of 2025, Bitcoin might record a maximum of $160,000, with a minimum price of $68,000 and an average price of $120,000. However, Bitcoin’s future market potential entirely depends on its buying demand, regulation, and investor sentiment regarding long-term holdings. Crypto analysts provide a positive sentiment as macroeconomic trends turn promising. We expect Bitcoin price to surpass a high of $216,000 by the end of 2027. Bitcoin historic price sentiment BTC price history: Coinmarketcap Satoshi Nakamoto created Bitcoin in 2009, marking the first use of blockchain technology. Bitcoin was initially of little value, gaining significant traction and hitting over $15,000 during the 2017 boom, with further highs reached in 2019 and 2021. In 2021, Bitcoin peaked at $68,789.63 but dropped to $15,760 by December 2022 amid economic pressures, including inflation and geopolitical conflicts. By April 10, 2023, Bitcoin’s price surged 83%, breaking the $30,000 resistance level. Throughout mid-2023, Bitcoin’s value hovered around $30,000, nearly reaching $32,000 due to positive market sentiments and potential ETF approvals. Bitcoin experienced a significant price drop in mid-August 2023, falling to $25,000. However, its prices remained volatile, fluctuating between $26,000 and $29,500 in October. Bitcoin closed 2023 above $42,000, a 155% increase from the year’s start. In early 2024, Bitcoin rose above $45,000 on ETF anticipation but briefly dipped below $40,000 after approvals. It broke its 2021 all-time high in March, reaching $73,750.07 on March 14, before dropping below $60,000 in April. May saw another surge above $70,000, while June and July brought heavy fluctuations between $70K and $55K. Bitcoin rallied to $66K in September after a Fed rate cut, climbed to $70K in October’s Uptober rally, and surged toward $108K following Donald Trump’s victory in the November US elections. BTC ended 2024 consolidating below $95K. At the start of January 2025, BTC was trading between $92,788.13 and $95,824.39. However, it formed an ATH at $109,114 on January 20. In the weeks of February, the price of BTC dropped heavily as it dropped toward the $78K low. In March, the price of Bitcoin declined heavily and dropped toward a low of $76.6K. In April, the price of Bitcoin started recovering. By the end of April, it neared the critical $95K zone. In May, Bitcoin price skyrocketed and it formed a new ATH at $111,970. However, the price declined later, toward $104K. By the end of June, BTC price reclaimed the $108K level. In July, BTC price triggered a surge toward $123K; however, it faced strong selling pressure later. In mid-August, the price of Bitcoin surged above $124K. However, the price failed to maintain its momentum as it dropped below $110K in early-September.",Crypto Price Predictions|BTC,EN,0,0,REGULATION|BUSINESS|BTC|TRADING|MARKET|UNI|BLOCKCHAIN|FIAT|MACROECONOMICS|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-09-14 09:39:25

Key Takeaways: Shibarium’s bridge was exploited in a flash loan attack, draining nearly $3 million in ETH, SHIB, and KNINE tokens. The attacker gained two-thirds validator control by flash-loaning 4.6M BONE, enabling them to finalize fraudulent checkpoints. Developers paused staking and brought in security firms, while hinting at a potential bounty offer if the funds are returned. According to Shiba Inu developer Kaal Dhairya , the attacker used a flash loan to borrow 4.6 million BONE, the governance token of Shibarium, and managed to gain access to 10 out of 12 validator signing keys. That control gave them the two-thirds consensus required to finalize fraudulent checkpoints on the network’s consensus layer, Heimdall. Shibarium Attacker Drains $2.4M in ETH and SHIB With majority control in place, the attacker proceeded to drain around 224.57 ETH and 92.6 billion SHIB tokens from the Shibarium bridge contract, collectively worth approximately $2.4 million at the time. A further $700,000 in KNINE tokens tied to K9 Finance were also impacted. However, K9 Finance’s DAO moved swiftly to blacklist the attacker’s address, rendering the KNINE tokens unsellable. In response to the breach, Shibarium developers halted staking and unstaking across the network. Because the attacker’s borrowed BONE tokens remain subject to an unstaking delay, developers were able to freeze the position before full exit, effectively locking the attacker out of validator control for the time being. Dhairya described the exploit as “sophisticated” and suggested it was likely “planned for months.” Shibarium Bridge Security Update Earlier today, a sophisticated ( probably planned for months ) attack was carried out using a flash loan to purchase 4.6M BONE. The attacker gained access to validator signing keys, achieved majority validator power, and signed a malicious… — Kaal (@kaaldhairya) September 13, 2025 He confirmed that law enforcement has been contacted and that security firms Hexens, Seal 911, and PeckShield are now involved in the investigation. He also left the door open to negotiations, stating that if the attacker returns the funds, a bounty might be considered in lieu of legal action. Community researcher Zilayo on X provided a technical breakdown of the incident, pointing to suspicious validator behavior tied to Ryoshi Labs. The fraudulent checkpoint was signed by 10 validators who controlled around 40% of the stake. Once the attacker delegated the flash-loaned BONE to Ryoshi’s validator, the weighted stake surpassed 66%, enabling a full consensus takeover. Shibarium was attacked yesterday & the bridge drained for nearly $3m. Here's how it happened 1/ Ryoshi Labs' validator (and perhaps others) were compromised or malicious from the start. They proposed a fraudulent checkpoint on Heimdall (Shibarium's consensus engine). 2/… pic.twitter.com/yq1BdFYdra — Zilayo (@0xZilayo) September 13, 2025 The price of BONE spiked in the immediate aftermath of the attack, briefly rising from $0.165 to $0.294 before settling back around $0.202. SHIB, meanwhile, is up 4.5% in the past 24 hours, driven in part by renewed attention following the breach. Bitcoin Hacks, Thefts Cost Investors $2.2B in H1 2025: CertiK Crypto investors lost over $2.2 billion to hacks , scams, and breaches in the first half of 2025, driven largely by wallet compromises and phishing attacks, according to CertiK’s latest security report. Wallet breaches alone caused $1.7 billion in losses across just 34 incidents, while phishing scams accounted for over $410 million across 132 attacks. Two major incidents, including Bybit’s $1.5 billion hack in February and Cetus Protocol’s $225 million exploit in May, skewed the year’s losses upward, together accounting for nearly $1.78 billion. Without these, losses align more closely with previous years at around $690 million. Ethereum remained the primary target, suffering over $1.6 billion in losses across 175 events.

Savings accounts often offer under 2%, government bonds hover around 3-5%, and even high yield fixed deposits rarely exceed double digits. In contrast, XRP Tundra’s staking calculator shows returns that make those options look weak. With Tundra, staking XRP in certain Cryo Vaults can deliver base APYs in the range of 8–12% for short commitments. But for those who stake XRP + TUNDRA in a “Frostbite” style vault, returns jump significantly: up to 21% base APY, rising to 31.5% at the 90-day mark. That means someone staking a moderate amount could earn more in a few months than many earn in a full year through traditional yield instruments. Calculator-Backed Returns That Change the Game The XRP Tundra staking calculator provides transparent estimates based on real parameters: Vault type: Cryo / Cryostasis, Frostbite (XRP+TUNDRA), Glacier (TUNDRA only) Staking period: 7, 30, 60, or 90 days with increasing multipliers for longer terms Rewards paid in TUNDRA tokens; original XRP remains on XRPL throughout the staking period For example, the “Frostbite” vault gives roughly 21% APY for a 7-day stake. If the same vault is used with a 90-day stake, returns increase to around 31.5% APY. Fees are deducted in TUNDRA per deposit and withdrawal, which slightly lowers net returns, but even after fees the projected yield stays well above what traditional financial instruments offer. Comparing With Traditional Options Here’s how Tundra’s staking stacks up against standard yield vehicles: Option Approximate Return Savings account Government bond / Treasury note 3-5% High-yield fixed deposit / CD 7-10% in best cases XRP Tundra Cryo Vaults (90 days) ~12% APY XRP Tundra Frostbite Vaults (90 days) ~31.5% APY Even the base tier staking in Cryo Vaults delivers more than many fixed income instruments. And Frostbite vaults, which require staking XRP + TUNDRA together, give a dramatically higher reward for those willing to take slightly more risk or lock up capital longer. However, high returns often come with trade-offs. With Tundra: Lockup periods (7 to 90 days) mean capital is illiquid while staked. Rewards are in TUNDRA tokens, which have volatility risk tied to their own valuation. Operations require paying fees in TUNDRA for deposit and withdrawal, which slightly reduce net gains. Still, donors value how much more return is possible compared to bank yields, especially when inflation, taxes, and opportunity cost are factored in. Trust And Verification Security matters when returns look too good to be true. XRP Tundra has been audited by independent firms: Cyberscope , Solidproof , Freshcoins . The core team also passed full KYC verification with Vital Block . These checks include contract security, emissions schedules, fee structures, and token allocations to ensure everything works as advertised and returns are earned under known rules. What This Means For Investors For many XRP holders, the choice has been between banks with tiny returns or speculative plays. With Tundra staking, there’s now a third path: produce meaningful yield, keep custody, and operate on-ledger. If your capital is locked for 90 days, Frostbite vaults could deliver returns multiples higher than traditional fixed income. Even conservative staking with XRPL-only vaults looks far better than savings accounts or CDs for many markets. This makes XRP Tundra an attractive option for those who want returns now, not just from long-term price moves.

The Allure of XRP Tundra Staking XRP Tundra introduces an innovative staking mechanism across platforms like the XRP Ledger and Solana, providing remarkably high annual percentage yields (APY). Their specialized staking calculator, designed for transparency, showcases potential earnings that far exceed those of conventional financial products. How Does Staking with XRP Tundra Work? Staking with XRP Tundra involves locking up XRP alone or in combination with TUNDRA tokens in different types of vaults—Cryo, Frostbite, or Glacier. Each vault type offers varying degrees of returns based on the staking period and the combination of cryptocurrencies staked. Profitability of Different Vault Types The Frostbite vaults, for instance, offer an enticing base APY of 21%, which can escalate to approximately 31.5% for staking periods as short as 90 days. This is a significant enhancement compared to the modest APYs provided by traditional banks or high-yield CDs. Comparative Analysis of Returns Financial OptionApproximate YieldSavings Account Ensuring Security and Trust in Staking To ensure the security and reliability of their staking platform, XRP Tundra has been rigorously audited by reputable firms like Cyberscope , Solidproof , and Freshcoins .

Price action suggests the market is consolidating after previous advances, with resistance levels around $240 and support around $220. Investors are paying attention to both technical charts and market sentiment in an attempt to assess potential near-term behavior. Meanwhile, there is also growing curiosity in the broader crypto ecosystem towards new DeFi players such as Mutuum Finance. Official Bug Bounty Program Mutuum Finance, in collaboration with CertiK, is launching an official Bug Bounty Program with a prize pool of $50,000 USDT. The program is open to accepting white-hat hackers and security researchers to find bugs in the project’s codebase. Bugs are classified on a severity scale, critical, major, minor, and low, and accordingly, prizes are distributed. The aims of the program are to strengthen the security of the platform, protect investors, and safeguard users across the ecosystem. Dynamic Interest and Liquidity Models Mutuum Finance has a liquidity-balanced dynamic interest rate model. In times of low interest rates, lending is appealing, so participants borrow and use the platform more intensively. Conversely, higher rates induce repayments and subsequent funding inputs. Highly liquid assets are well-suited for fixed rates of interest, stabilizing while allowing renegotiation on account of changes in the market. As a fully decentralized platform, the MUTM token holders possess the governance rights, providing borrowers with autonomy while ensuring system sustainability. The interest rate architecture encourages long-term efficiency, enables automatic portfolio diversification, and ensures that the platform remains responsive to the continually evolving DeFi environment. Accurate Price Discovery Correct pricing helps in the process of borrowing, lending, and liquidation. Mutuum Finance uses Chainlink oracles to give market prices in USD as well as natively supported tokens such as ETH, MATIC, and AVAX. Fallback oracles, composite feeds, and time-weighted averages from decentralized exchanges are also integrated on the platform for correct valuations even in the case of distressed market conditions. Dual-Layer Lending Framework Mutuum Finance utilizes a two-layer lending platform that provides users with two options: Peer-to-Peer (P2P) lending or Peer-to-Contract (P2C) lending. In P2C, intelligent contracts proactively monitor markets to optimize interest payments, allowing lenders to lend and reward investors with automated interest sharing. In the P2P structure, lenders and borrowers bargain directly without the mediation of middlemen, offering more autonomy and flexibility. This two-pronged approach balances between efficiency and liberty, making the lending system reliable and easy. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is emerging as a high-performing DeFi altcoin, while Solana (SOL) aims for a potential 3x return. Stage 6 tokens are at $0.035 and will rise 14.29% to $0.04 at Stage 7. Presale has already raised $15.68M with 16,280+ investors, signaling strong demand. MUTM combines a $50K CertiK bug bounty, dynamic interest and liquidity protocols, dual P2C/P2P lending, and governance management, ensuring security, flexibility, and long-term scalability. Secure Stage 6 tokens now ahead of the next price surge.

CEO Brian Armstrong announced the transparency initiative amid ongoing disputes with projects claiming the exchange demanded substantial payments for token listings. The guide comes as Coinbase struggles with declining revenues and trading volumes. Second-quarter results showed $1.5 billion in revenue, missing analyst expectations of $1.59 billion, while consumer trading volume dropped 45% to $43 billion. Net income plummeted to $33.2 million from $294.4 million in Q2 2024. Source: Coinbase Coinbase stock dropped 9.2% in after-hours trading following Q2 results, but has gained nearly 50% year-to-date. XRP emerged as an unexpected revenue bright spot, generating 13% of consumer transaction revenue compared to Ethereum’s 12% for the second consecutive quarter. Detailed Process Addresses Fee Controversy The listing guide outlines a five-step evaluation process, including application submission, business assessment, and core reviews covering legal, compliance, and technical security factors. Coinbase emphasizes that listings connect projects to deep liquidity and a global customer base within a trusted regulatory framework. The exchange addresses common roadblocks, including securities risk assessments based on public statements and marketing materials. According to the guideline, projects highlighting token utility and governance rights face smoother reviews than those promising speculative returns or “moon” scenarios. Average due diligence takes one week, with trading enabled within two weeks of approval, though timelines vary significantly based on asset complexity. Tokens on supported networks, including Ethereum, Base, Solana, Arbitrum, Optimism, Polygon, and Avalanche, receive expedited processing compared to new blockchain integrations. We get a ton of questions about how and why assets get listed on Coinbase. To be more transparent we wrote a guide on how it all works. TL;DR: listings are free and merit-based. Every asset is evaluated against the same standards. Link in replies. pic.twitter.com/HmqQDt6085 — Brian Armstrong (@brian_armstrong) September 12, 2025 The guide coincides with Coinbase’s strategic pivot toward becoming an “everything exchange” supporting millions of tokens through decentralized exchange integration. Since then, Armstrong has announced plans to eliminate intensive listing barriers that have limited asset additions. As part of the guideline, the exchange’s phased market launch process includes transfer-only periods, limit order auctions, and full trading states designed to protect market integrity during new asset introductions. Notably, this new transparency guideline follows multiple allegations of misconduct. Earlier in November 2024, TRON founder Justin Sun disputed Armstrong’s free listing claims , alleging that Coinbase requested 500 million TRX worth $80 million plus a $250 million Bitcoin deposit in Coinbase Custody. Sun noted that Binance listed TRON without fees, while Sonic Labs co-founder Andre Cronje also reported similar experiences with Coinbase demanding $30-300 million. Revenue Pressures Drive New Monetization Strategies Amid Market Challenges Last month, Coinbase introduced a 0.1% fee on USDC-to-USD conversions exceeding $5 million within 30-day periods starting August 13. This was the first monetization of previously free stablecoin off-ramping services. The change addresses competitive disadvantages from Tether’s existing redemption fees that made USDC the cheapest route for large-scale fiat conversions. The fee implementation triggered user backlash, comparing Coinbase to traditional banking institutions. CEO Armstrong defended the decision as necessary to address arbitrage opportunities where users swapped USDT to USDC before converting to USD, reducing USDC supply while maintaining USDT circulation. @Coinbase is turning to the bond market for support after a disappointing second-quarter earnings report triggered a sell-off in its stock. #Coinbase #Coin https://t.co/QAMu3x06KO — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) August 5, 2025 Following disappointing Q2 results, Coinbase also announced a $2 billion convertible senior notes offering split between 2029 and 2032 maturities. Proceeds will fund capped call transactions to limit share dilution and support corporate needs, including working capital, acquisitions, and debt repurchases. The company purchased 2,509 Bitcoin worth $222 million during Q2, bringing total holdings to 11,776 BTC and placing it among the top 10 public holders ahead of Tesla. However, Bitcoin accumulation couldn’t offset broader revenue declines affecting overall performance. Coinbase continues expanding revenue streams through prediction markets, tokenized stocks, and derivatives for U.S. users. The exchange secured a European MiCA license through Luxembourg’s financial regulator while pursuing partnerships, including Chase Ultimate Rewards point transfers to crypto wallets. Despite financial challenges, TIME also recognized Coinbase as one of 2025’s 100 Most Influential Companies, labeling it a “disruptor” for shaping U.S. digital asset policies and predicting it could become the central hub for American crypto trading. The regulatory landscape supporting Coinbase’s transparency push includes the SEC’s Project Crypto initiative , which aims to enable on-chain financial markets, and the GENIUS Act , which creates frameworks for payment stablecoins.

Among the projects are Ozak AI (OZ) , a presale token merging artificial intelligence and blockchain; Cardano (ADA), a research-based Layer-1 community; and Polygon (MATIC), Ethereum’s main scaling solution. With analysts highlighting strong fundamentals for ADA and Polygon and 100× ROI forecasts for Ozak AI, those 3 cryptos are positioning themselves as potential outperformers to Ethereum. Ozak AI: Presale Star With 100× Potential Ozak AI (OZ) is one of the quickest-developing presales of 2025, already raising greater than $3 million at a token price of just $0.01. Positioned on the intersection of AI and blockchain, Ozak AI aspires to create smarter, adaptive, decentralized programs, supplying both narrative strength and real-world innovation. Analysts advise OZ may want to surge to $1 or better, delivering 100× returns for early participants. With this method, even a modest $500 allocation nowadays could grow into $50,000 on the projected target. With each whale and crypto trader collecting, Ozak AI is emerging as one of the most explosive possibilities in the market. Cardano: Research-Driven Layer-1 Growth Cardano (ADA), trading at $0.9247, has long been known for its peer-reviewed approach to blockchain development and a strong emphasis on scalability and sustainability. With the recent Chang hard fork upgrade and growing adoption of decentralized applications on its network, ADA is set to benefit from increased utility. From a technical perspective, ADA faces resistance at $0.95, $1.10, and $1.25, while support sits at $0.90, $0.85, and $0.80. Analysts believe ADA could push toward $5 in the next cycle, offering a solid 5× return for long-term holders. While not as explosive as OZ presale tokens, Cardano’s credibility and ecosystem strength make it a reliable Layer-1 contender. Polygon: Ethereum’s Scaling Powerhouse Polygon (MATIC), priced at $0.28, continues to play a critical role in scaling Ethereum by reducing transaction fees and increasing speed. Its adoption across DeFi, NFTs, and gaming remains strong, with partnerships spanning enterprises and Web3 developers. On the charts, MATIC faces resistance at $0.30, $0.35, and $0.40, while support holds at $0.27, $0.25, and $0.22. Analysts forecast a rally toward $5 in the next bull run, offering nearly an 18× return from current levels. While larger-cap than Ozak AI, Polygon provides investors a more established, safer play with long-term potential. Ozak AI, Cardano, and Polygon are three cryptos that could outperform Ethereum in 2025. Cardano at $0.9247 offers research-driven growth with a realistic path to $5, while Polygon at $0.28 remains Ethereum’s top scaling solution with upside toward $5 as well. Yet, it is Ozak AI’s $0.01 presale entry, $3 million raised, and 100× ROI forecast that truly positions it as the standout. For investors chasing exponential returns, Ozak AI offers the kind of ground-floor opportunity that Cardano and Polygon once provided in their earliest days. About Ozak AI Ozak AI is a blockchain-based crypto project that provides an innovative platform that focuses on predictive AI and advanced data analytics for financial markets. Through machine learning algorithms and decentralized community technologies, Ozak AI enables real-time, accurate, and actionable insights to help crypto lovers and corporations make the perfect choices.

However, as we approach 2025, the spotlight begins to shift towards new contenders, like Ozak AI (OZ) , Cardano (ADA), and Polygon (MATIC), which are poised for potential high growth. The Next Generation of Crypto Innovations Ozak AI: A New Frontier in AI and Blockchain Ozak AI distinguishes itself by integrating artificial intelligence with blockchain technology, aiming for a transformative impact on decentralized applications. This project, currently in the presale phase, has already garnered significant interest, raising over $3 million with tokens priced at just $0.01. With predictions of its value potentially reaching $1, Ozak AI could deliver returns up to 100 times for early investors. This has attracted both individual crypto enthusiasts and large-scale investors. Cardano: Sustainable and Scalable Blockchain Known for its rigorous peer-review system and academic approach, Cardano continues to be a formidable player in the blockchain sphere. Recent technological advancements and an increase in dApp integration have enhanced ADA's utility and adoption. With its price poised just below the $1 mark, technical analysis shows potential resistance and support levels, forecasting a possible rise to $5 per ADA in the near future. Polygon: Enhancing Ethereum's Capabilities Polygon serves as a scaling solution for Ethereum, facilitating faster transactions and reduced fees. Its utility across various applications in DeFi, NFTs, and gaming secures its position as a crucial element in the Ethereum ecosystem. Currently valued at $0.28, MATIC shows potential for significant growth with projections reaching as high as $5, representing a substantial increase from current figures. In summary, while Ethereum remains a powerhouse, the rising stars of Ozak AI, Cardano, and Polygon are setting the stage for potentially higher gains in the crypto market.

51704490,https://timestabloid.com/?p=82972,1757844024,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/67/default.png,Cardano (ADA) vs. Mutuum Finance (MUTM): Which Crypto to Buy Today for Long-Term 20x Potential?,https://timestabloid.com/cardano-ada-vs-mutuum-finance-mutm-which-crypto-to-buy/,"Crypto investors are always hunting for tokens that can transform modest sums into life-changing gains. Cardano (ADA) once offered exactly that, but in today’s market, attention is shifting to new contenders. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) , priced at just $0.035, is increasingly being described as one of the few early-stage tokens capable of delivering a 20x return over the next cycle. Cardano (ADA) Cardano’s history provides the perfect example of what early adoption can achieve. In its early days, ADA traded for mere cents. A $500 investment at $0.02 secured 25,000 tokens. When ADA later surged above $2 during the bull market, that stake ballooned into more than $50,000. Stories like these cemented Cardano’s reputation as one of the great wealth-generating plays of the last cycle, rewarding early believers with once-in-a-lifetime multiples. Today, however, ADA trades at around $0.88 with a market cap north of $31 billion. While it remains a respected blue-chip with active development and a vast ecosystem, the sheer scale of its valuation makes another 100× surge virtually impossible. Even a doubling or tripling of ADA’s price would require billions in fresh inflows, delivering respectable returns but far from the exponential upside it once offered. This reality is why investors seeking the next breakout are now turning toward projects like Mutuum Finance, tokens with smaller starting valuations but equally ambitious roadmaps. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Mutuum Finance is a decentralized lending and borrowing protocol designed to bring functionality from the very start. Unlike projects that wait months or years after listing to introduce products, Mutuum will launch with its beta platform live on day one, allowing users to lend, borrow, and participate as liquidators immediately. The presale numbers already show strong momentum. To date, over $15.65 million has been raised, with more than 16,250 holders onboard and upwards of 710 million tokens sold. Currently in Phase 6 at $0.035, the price is set to jump to $0.040 in the next phase, before officially listing at $0.06. That means investors entering today are locking in nearly 100% gains. Mechanics Driving MUTM’s Growth and Price Targets Mutuum Finance’s strength lies in its design, which is built to create lasting demand for MUTM tokens well beyond the presale stage. Its dual-lending markets combine both variable and stable borrowing options, striking a balance that keeps liquidity active and ensures borrowers and lenders alike are incentivized to participate. This foundation gives Mutuum Finance a sustainable system rather than a short-lived hype cycle. Another key driver is the introduction of mtTokens, which give depositors yield-bearing assets that remain liquid. Holders can earn passive income while still moving their capital across DeFi, making their funds work in more than one place at once. On top of this, the buy-and-distribute mechanism continuously recycles protocol fees into purchasing MUTM from the open market, creating steady buy pressure that supports long-term price growth. Together, these features are designed to compound demand as adoption grows. The first major price catalyst comes at launch. With the beta platform going live and the listing price set at $0.06, analysts expect adoption to quickly push MUTM toward $0.2–$0.3 in the first few months. For Phase 6 investors at $0.035, that translates into a potential 7-10x return in less than a year. Mid-term growth is expected to remain strong as mtTokens and the buy-and-distribute cycle continue to generate momentum, with predictions placing MUTM in the $1.00–$1.25 range within 12 months. Looking further ahead, long-term expansion will be shaped by major roadmap milestones. The launch of an overcollateralized stablecoin is expected to anchor liquidity and create recurring borrowing flows, while Layer-2 integration will cut transaction costs and make the platform more scalable for both retail and institutional users. With these upgrades in place, analysts forecast that MUTM could climb to around $1.75–$2 by 2026, representing more than 20x growth from today’s presale level. The Next Life-Changing Opportunity The difference between an established blue-chip and an early-stage token becomes clear with a simple example. A $650 investment in Cardano at $0.88 would secure roughly 740 ADA. If ADA climbed to $1.25, that position would be worth about $925. It’s a respectable gain, but far from the kind of transformational returns that early adopters once enjoyed. Now consider the same $650 invested in MUTM at $0.035. At launch, that stake would already be worth around $1,115 when the price hits $0.06. When MUTM climbs to $0.40 in its adoption phase, the position would jump to more than $7,400. And once it reaches its longer-term forecast of $1.85, that same $650 would grow to over $34,000. That contrast shows exactly why investors who once profited from ADA’s early surge are now shifting focus to MUTM. Cardano’s early days created life-changing wealth for small investors, turning pocket-sized stakes into tens of thousands of dollars. But as a large-cap today, its potential for exponential multiples has diminished. Mutuum Finance now represents the kind of early-stage opportunity that ADA once was, a token with tangible utility, strong presale momentum, and a roadmap that directly connects features to price growth. With the presale in Phase 6 at $0.035, set to rise to $0.040 and officially listing at $0.06, early buyers are already positioned for near-double returns before exchanges even open. From there, the path to a potential 20x gain by 2026 is supported by structural mechanics, growing adoption, and long-term scalability plans. For those asking whether Cardano or Mutuum Finance offers the better chance at significant upside today, the answer is clear. ADA has matured into a strong but stable blue-chip. MUTM, on the other hand, is still at the stage where early entry could mean catching the next wave of life-changing returns.

Previous Comments Spark Speculation,https://timestabloid.com/was-charlie-kirk-an-xrp-holder-previous-comments-spark-speculation/,"A resurfaced interview has renewed interest in conservative commentator Charlie Kirk’s connection to cryptocurrency. The video, posted by Amelie (@_Crypto_Barbie), a prominent XRP enthusiast, shows Kirk distancing himself from Bitcoin while hinting at a stronger position in another asset. His remarks suggested involvement with XRP, a cryptocurrency many in the community consider central to the industry’s future. The renewed focus comes just days after Kirk’s assassination, which has drawn widespread attention across political and cultural circles. When asked during the interview if he owned Bitcoin, Kirk responded, “I actually have better stuff than that. I am a significant investor in the plumbing of how crypto is made.” Many observers believe he was referring to XRP, which has long been positioned as more than a speculative token and as a part of the infrastructure supporting global digital transactions . WOW! Was Charlie Kirk an #XRP holder? „Do you invest in Bitcoin?“ „I actually have better stuff than that!“ He seemed to know something most don’t… Vid credit: @KingKaranCrypto pic.twitter.com/tsceUubdNv — 𝓐𝓶𝓮𝓵𝓲𝓮 (@_Crypto_Barbie) September 13, 2025 The Weight of Kirk’s Remarks Kirk’s death added gravity to the resurfacing of the interview. For his supporters in the crypto community, the timing reinforced the belief that he had recognized the potential of XRP earlier than most. They viewed his statement as evidence that he was aligned with a project they see as a cornerstone of the financial system. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Amelie highlighted this in her post, suggesting that Kirk likely knew something about XRP that many others did not. Her framing of the clip emphasized that his comments were not casual but rooted in a deeper understanding of the asset’s utility . To many of her followers, this confirmed suspicions that influential figures had insight into XRP before it gained broader recognition. Positioning Against Bitcoin Kirk’s comment that he did not hold Bitcoin reinforced the notion that his focus lay elsewhere. Within the crypto community, supporters often compare XRP to Bitcoin, seeing the former as more advanced in terms of utility and efficiency. Some even argue that XRP’s code predates Bitcoin , seeing it as a foundational part of the crypto industry. For Kirk, a figure already aligned with American nationalist values, support for XRP was taken by his followers as consistent with broader political ideals. Much like Donald Trump, who has also been praised for his pro-American and pro-crypto stance , many saw Kirk as a visionary willing to challenge established narratives.

Each project claims unique advantages, promising strong returns for early supporters. With fierce competition and big hopes, only close analysis will show which one could turn ordinary holders into the next wave of millionaires. XYZVerse Sets a New Trend, Could This be the Next 50X Meme Coin? The buzz around XYZVerse is real. As the first-ever all-sports meme token, it is going to break records in the meme coin space, targeting 50X growth upon launch. The current presale gives early investors the chance to grab $XYZ tokens at a significantly discounted price, far below the expected listing price. Bullish Mood on $XYZ XYZVerse is already featured on CoinMarketCap where the community has shown a strongly bullish mood on this coin, with 95% voters anticipating $XYZ to grow. XYZ was further noticed by reputable crypto influencers. DanjoCapitalMaster , who has close to 800,000 followers, recently expressed his support for the project, calling XYZVerse a “moonshot opportunity.” More Than Just a Meme Coin Unlike most meme coins that ride trends without much substance, XYZVerse is setting a new trend. It is blending the high-energy world of sports with the viral nature of meme culture. And it’s working. The presale is moving fast, with early buyers locking in tokens at a fraction of what some believe could be its future value. Right now, XYZVerse is still in its presale phase, but demand is high. The price has already climbed from $0.0001 in Stage 1 to $0.005 by Stage 13, with over $15 million already raised. Investors who got in early have secured a steep discount, and with a target listing price of $0.1, those numbers have people paying attention. Still Time to Get in Before the Presale Ends Beyond just hype, XYZVerse has a structured tokenomics model aimed at long-term sustainability. A share of 15% is allocated to liquidity to create a solid market foundation.To reward its community via airdrops and bonuses, the team has put aside 10% of the total supply. Moreover, a big chunk of 17.13% is designated for deflationary burns, which could reduce supply and drive demand for $XYZ over time. A Community-Driven Project With Big Plans One thing setting XYZVerse apart is how it engages its community. The team recently launched the Ambassador Program, giving users the chance to earn free tokens by supporting the project. And that’s just the start—there are already talks with major sports celebrities to help boost visibility. The recent partnership with decentralized sportsbook bookmaker.XYZ underscores XYZVerse’s commitment to expanding its utility. It’s a big move that gives the community something to actually use. As part of the deal, $XYZ holders get a special bonus on their first bet—a nice perk that adds extra value just for being part of the ecosystem. Could XYZVerse Be the Next Big Meme Coin? With a fast-growing presale, a strong community, and an ambitious roadmap, XYZVerse has the ingredients of a project with serious potential. While the crypto market is always unpredictable, many investors see this as an opportunity to get in early on something big. The presale won’t last forever—so if you’re interested, now might be the time to take a closer look. Join XYZVerse, the Next Moonshot Opportunity XRP: The Fast Coin Racing Ahead in a Slow Crypto Market XRP lives on the XRP Ledger, a public network built for speed and low cost. It was created by Jed McCaleb, Arthur Britto, and David Schwartz to move value anywhere, in seconds, for a tiny fee. There were 100 billion coins at launch, with 80 billion given to Ripple for growth. Ripple locked 55 billion in escrow, releasing set amounts each month to keep supply steady. Because the system has no single ruler, payments cannot be blocked or reversed, and users do not need a bank account to join. Today’s market feels sleepy, yet XRP keeps drawing eyes. Bitcoin stays a store of value, and Ethereum courts app builders. XRP focuses on one clear goal: instant payments across any currency. That focus may shine as firms look for faster global transfers. Its price still sits well below its 2018 peak, so believers see room to climb if demand rises. The coin’s fixed rules on supply, plus Ripple’s push for new partnerships, add extra fuel. While no asset is a sure bet, XRP’s blend of speed, cost, and mature network makes it a standout contender in this cycle. ADA: The Green Engine Ready for the Next Crypto Sprint Cardano is a fresh take on blockchain. It runs on a clever two-layer design: one layer moves money, the other runs apps like games and lending tools. This split keeps the network quick and smooth, with room to handle up to a million deals each second. Cardano’s heart is the Ouroboros system, which picks block makers in a low-energy way. That means far less power than older coins that rely on heavy computer work. Its own coin, ADA, lets people pay, save, and earn rewards by helping secure the network. In today’s market, green and scalable coins are catching eyes, and ADA fits that trend. Big rivals like Ethereum are still moving to lighter tech, while Cardano started there from day one. Fees stay small even when traffic surges, making it friendly for new finance apps. Add fresh native tokens, launched in 2021, and builders get a cheap way to launch ideas. If the next cycle rewards real utility and clean power, ADA looks well placed. While no coin moves in a straight line, its blend of speed, low cost, and eco appeal makes it one to watch. Conclusion XRP and ADA look solid for the ongoing 2025 surge, but XYZVerse, the first all-sport memecoin, targets 20,000% growth through a community-led blend of meme culture, GameFi and sports partnerships.

This budget-friendly altcoin for just $0.035 has been supported by more than 16,240 investors. As opposed to the meme coin volatility that tends to define DOGE’s trajectory, Mutuum Finance is positioning itself as a long-term coin with its focus on lending, borrowing, and scalable on-chain utility. Dogecoin Consolidates Amid Steady Market Flows Dogecoin (DOGE) is currently priced at $0.26026, fluctuating on the daily range of $0.24583 to $0.26339. The market is in a consolidation stage, with DOGE being steady as overall market conditions control volumes and moods. While arguments over its long-term trajectory persist, the stability here marks it as one of the more established cryptocurrencies in circulation, even as newer DeFi projects such as Mutuum Finance take center stage in the market’s discussion. Mutuum Finance Stage 6 Momentum Investors are active buying MUTM tokens at $0.035 in Stage 6 of the presale. Stage 7 is fast approaching, and demand continues to accelerate. To date, more than 16,240 investors have accumulated tokens, and the project has surpassed more than $15.63 million in funding, a clear indicator of market demand being high and expectations of launch on the rise. Precision in Price Discovery For lending, borrowing, and liquidation operations security, Chainlink oracles are utilized by Mutuum Finance for prices and token values in terms of USD for tokens such as ETH, MATIC, and AVAX. Fallback oracle configurations, composite data feeds, and time-weighted averages from decentralized exchanges are included to increase precision. This multi-layer method ensures that price information is as uniform as possible even with highly stressful market conditions. Market volatility directly affects collateral management within the protocol. Liquidation and LTV thresholds are separated based on asset stability. Riskier assets, or tokens, have lower borrowing limits, while safer assets receive more favorable limits. Reserve multipliers are used proportionally, at 10% for less-risky assets and 35% for riskiest holdings, to create a buffer without compromising diversification. Shaping the Future of DeFi Mutuum Finance is working on a protocol that enables active use of capital by passive borrowing and lending, which can enable users to borrow against securitized stacks of assets. The protocol is powered by a stability algorithm and an interest rate optimization algorithm, both of which are designed for maximum efficiency and long-term sustainability of capital utilization. The fulcrum of Mutuum Finance is the lending protocol comprising Peer-to-Contract and Peer-to-Peer lending. In Peer-to-Contract, liquidity pools are controlled through smart contracts and interest rates are dynamically calculated, while in Peer-to-Peer, lenders and borrowers negotiate with the facility the application of fixed or variable rates. It differs from the majority of its contemporaries through the union of malleability and solidity. Risk and Liquidity Safeguards The protocol proactively manages risk and liquidity to enable effectively liquidating impaired positions. Risk exposures are kept within close limits, supported by liquidation levels clearly defined. Collateral assets such as stablecoins and ETH offer additional LTV levels, enabling more risky assets to be collateralized by safer assets. Reserve factors are proportionally allocated across asset classes, balancing opportunity and risk, and enhancing protection of the protocol’s reserves. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is gaining momentum as Dogecoin (DOGE) consolidates, offering utility-led alternative exposure with long-term potential to the upside. Stage 6 presale tokens sit at $0.035, with Stage 7 set to rise, generating a sense of urgency for the first movers. The project has already raised $15.63M from 16,240+ investors, outlining strong demand. With Chainlink oracle integration, strong risk controls, and dual lending models, MUTM is positioned for sustainable DeFi growth. While DOGE has the potential to return 10x, MUTM’s actual practical applications give it the potential for greater returns, analysts say. Lock up your tokens now before the next stage price bubble.

51706195,https://finbold.com/?p=253167,1757846623,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/finbold.png,ChatGPT-5 sets timeline when quantum computers will break Bitcoin’s encryption,https://finbold.com/chatgpt-5-sets-timeline-when-quantum-computers-will-break-bitcoins-encryption/,"The ongoing advancement in quantum computing is raising urgent questions about the long-term security of Bitcoin ( BTC ). Unlike classical machines, quantum computers can solve certain problems exponentially faster, posing a direct threat to Bitcoin. Notably, using Shor’s algorithm, a sufficiently powerful quantum computer could break elliptic curve cryptography (ECC) and recover private keys from public keys in hours, putting exposed funds at risk. It’s worth noting, as reported by Finbold, that analysts have offered varying timelines for when this technology might crack Bitcoin, with many settling on the next decade as the critical period. Probability of quantum computers cracking Bitcoin Meanwhile, Finbold gathered insights from OpenAI’s latest artificial intelligence (AI) model, ChatGPT-5 , which issued its own estimates on when this scenario could become reality, projecting a gradual increase in risk over the coming decades. The model highlighted the mid-to-late 2030s as the most likely window for “cryptographically relevant” quantum computers, machines capable of breaking Bitcoin’s ECDSA (secp256k1). To this end, ChatGPT-5 provided cumulative probability estimates, assigning less than a 5% chance for the 2025 to 2029 period, citing current device limitations and immature error correction. It placed the probability between 15% and 25% for 2030 to 2034 if breakthroughs in error correction, qubit yield, and coding align. The greatest likelihood was assigned to the 2035 and 2039 window at 45% to 60%, with hardware scaling and algorithmic improvements expected to enable the first practical key-recovery demonstrations. If development continues at the current pace, the 2040s carry an 80% to 95% likelihood, and by 2050, the probability rises to nearly 99%, barring a global technical catastrophe. Bitcoin code cracking timeline. Source: ChatGPT Bitcoin code cracking timeline acceleration The model cautioned that certain milestones could immediately accelerate the timeline, such as large-scale fault-tolerant qubits, machines with millions of low-error qubits, full demonstrations of Shor’s algorithm, or government advisories shifting from planning to urgent migration. To mitigate these risks, ChatGPT recommended proactive measures, including auditing addresses, avoiding key reuse, and moving funds away from exposed keys. It also advised piloting post-quantum or hybrid signatures between 2026 and 2029, completing critical custody migration by 2032–2035, and ensuring full network readiness by 2035.

Trading volumes in the region surged ninefold between 2021 and 2024, reaching $27 billion in 2025, according to a recent Dune Analytics report. Stablecoins dominate, accounting for over 90% of exchange activity, with real- and peso-pegged tokens growing at triple-digit rates. But while adoption accelerates, an unexpected paradox is emerging: crypto media visibility is shrinking just when users need it most. A new Q2 2025 report from Outset PR highlights this divide, showing that while millions in Brazil, Argentina, and Mexico increasingly rely on digital assets for payments, savings, and remittances, the region’s crypto-native outlets are losing readers at an alarming pace. Adoption on the Rise For people in Brazil, Mexico, Argentina, and beyond, stablecoins offer something local currencies often can’t: reliability. More than 90 percent of exchange activity in the region now runs through dollar-pegged tokens like USDT and USDC. Local versions are catching on too. Real-pegged stablecoins in Brazil have grown more than sixfold in just a year, while peso-linked tokens in Mexico have expanded at a pace few expected. These tokens aren’t just traded on exchanges—they’re being used for salaries, remittances, and everyday payments. Apps like Picnic, Exa, and BlindPay are making this even easier by evolving into crypto-native neobanks. Instead of existing in a separate world, crypto now blends into daily financial life, with balances, savings, and spending options available in a single app. Crypto Media in Retreat While adoption is climbing, the media covering crypto in the region is shrinking. Outset PR’s latest report shows that crypto-native outlets lost more than half their traffic in Q2 2025, dropping from nearly 18 million visits to just over 8 million. By contrast, mainstream publishers—large news sites that cover crypto as one topic among many—actually grew their traffic by almost 20 million visits in the same period. The contrast is stark. A small minority of crypto-focused sites managed to grow by localizing content and leaning on search optimization. But most are fading. CriptoNoticias has become the clear leader, pulling in 1.35 million visits per month, while other outlets like Cointelegraph Brasil and Livecoins are seeing steady declines. Just one quarter ago, six sites in the region had more than 400,000 monthly visits and were referred to tier 1. Now, only one remains at that level. Source: outsetpr.io Why the Disconnect Matters This creates a paradox: more people are using crypto, but fewer are learning about it through crypto-native media. And that matters. Adoption doesn’t automatically translate into understanding. According to surveys, only about a third of Latin Americans consider crypto transactions secure. Without dedicated media to provide context, explain risks, and build trust, millions of new users are left navigating this space with limited knowledge. Mainstream coverage is filling part of the gap, but it’s not the same. General news outlets tend to treat crypto as just one story among many. Specialized reporting, with consistent attention to detail and education, is what builds literacy in a fast-changing field. If those voices fade, the risk is that usage races ahead of awareness. What Comes Next Brazil is a perfect example of this two-speed reality. On one hand, stablecoins are booming, infrastructure is improving, and apps are turning crypto into something ordinary people can use every day. On the other, the outlets that could help explain what’s happening are struggling to stay visible. The future of crypto in Latin America won’t just be defined by how many people adopt it. It will also depend on whether there’s a strong information layer that helps people use it wisely. Right now, adoption is racing ahead, but the media that supports understanding is falling behind. That gap could shape the region’s crypto story just as much as the technology itself. Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

Executive chairman of TON Strategy, Manuel Stotz, said the buybacks below the company’s TAV per share reinforce its strategy of steadily compounding its value per share. As of September 11, the crypto firm’s TAV per share was $12.181. The initiative follows its previously announced $250 million share buyback program. The digital asset treasury company is also committed to staking operations to generate on-chain income by utilizing its treasury holdings as planned.

According to the firm, the initiative demonstrates its commitment to shareholder value and long-term confidence in The Open Network ( TON ) ecosystem. The crypto company also said its repurchase program complements its recent launch of TON on Gemini , Robinhood, and Zengo. TON Strategy believes the initiative represents steps toward broader market access for the token as the native asset. Stotz said the buybacks and staking initiatives demonstrate the company’s conviction in both the durability of its balance sheet and the long-term opportunity it envisions. He added that staking allows the firm to turn its role as a long-term holder of TON into an active contributor to the network’s security by generating yield that compounds alongside its treasury. “We are executing on a strategic, disciplined capital allocation playbook. Staking introduces a recurring revenue stream into our model, while buyback allows us to enhance shareholder returns. At the same time, we are maintaining resources to continue expanding our TON treasury.” – Veronika Kapustina , CEO of TON Strategy Company. The crypto company launched its share repurchase program on September 8, which allows the firm to buy back up to $250 million of its common stock. The firm also appointed Cantor Fitzgerald & Co. as its non-exclusive agent to repurchase its shares. According to the report, the stock buy-back program provides flexibility around the timing and method of future repurchases in the open market or through other means in accordance with applicable securities laws. TON Strategy shares drop after buyback announcement The company also began trading as TONX on the Nasdaq on September 2 after renaming from Verb Technology Company. The firm also completed a $558 million private placement and adopted a TON treasury strategy . Its initiatives made it the first Nasdaq-listed company to establish TON as its primary treasury reserve asset. TON Strategy Company also revealed that its mission is to support the growth and security of tokenized networks by serving as a long-term holder of TON. TON Strategy shares dropped by nearly 7.5% after the buyback announcement on Friday, and are currently trading at $7.24 at the time of publication. The company’s stock price dipped more than 60% in the past month and 21% since adopting the TON reserve treasury. TON Foundation and Kingsway Capital Partners also raised approximately $400 million in July to launch a TON treasury company. Coinbase head of research David Duong and researcher Colin Basco said in a report on Wednesday that crypto-buying public companies are entering a player vs player stage where strategically positioned players will thrive. They argued that the initiative would see companies compete harder for investor money and could drive up crypto market prices from the unprecedented capital flowing into them.

Here’s the Timeline,https://timestabloid.com/egrag-crypto-to-xrp-holders-its-time-to-prepare-for-takeoff-heres-the-timeline/,"Prominent market analyst EGRAG CRYPTO (@egragcrypto) has posted a new analysis examining the Relative Strength Index (RSI) behavior for XRP. Known for long-term technical analysis, the analyst argues that XRP is exhibiting a familiar pattern seen in previous market cycles. “The curvature is looking remarkably similar, and it’s time to prepare for takeoff over the next 2-3 months!” EGRAG CRYPTO wrote, signaling heightened interest in how the RSI could guide traders’ expectations. #XRP : #RSI -Cycle Top Indicator ( UPDATE): The curvature is looking remarkably similar, and it’s time to prepare for takeoff over the next 2-3 months! For a detailed analysis on the #XRP #RSI , don’t miss the post from July 16, 2025, check it out below! #XRPFamily STAY… https://t.co/l5zLLYlWcc pic.twitter.com/hEah3MEbk5 — EGRAG CRYPTO (@egragcrypto) September 13, 2025 Pattern of Cycles and Curvature on the Chart The chart shows three distinct market cycles labeled as Cycle 1, Cycle 2, and Cycle 3. Each cycle highlights a three-step progression marked by the numbers 1, 2, and 3, with a key feature called “The Curvature” appearing after point 2 in all three cycles. According to the illustration, Cycle 1 peaked in late 2017, with XRP hitting its previous all-time high shortly after. Cycle 2 peaked in April 2021 when the asset hit $1.96, a level many believe it would have surpassed if not for price suppression from the Ripple lawsuit . Cycle 3 appears to be underway, with a projected culmination later in 2025. The upward move typically faces some bearish pressure forming the curvature before a rapid ascent. The asset reached $3.65 in July , before a retracement, and the RSI followed this pattern. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 However, XRP is now recovering, and the RSI shows a rebound forming and completing that curvature. If XRP’s RSI follows the established historical cycle , the chart suggests the next stage could align with historical tops. What the RSI Levels Suggest for XRP The RSI, a technical momentum indicator, has played a central role in EGRAG CRYPTO’s analysis of XRP’s potential. In the chart, horizontal lines mark three specific target zones: 80.11, 86.74, and 97.05. The labels on the right side indicate potential milestones if the pattern repeats, with 80.11 aligning near the lower band of projected RSI highs and 97.05 representing the upper band. Hitting similar levels took the asset from fractions of a cent to well over $3 in 2017, and repeating this historical cycle without the price suppression from the lawsuit opens the door to much higher targets for the digital asset in the next few months.

51706927,580772,1757847808,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/51706927.jpeg,Best Crypto to Buy After TOTAL2 Chart Hits New ATH: Altcoin Boom Incoming?,https://bitcoinist.com/best-crypto-to-buy-after-total2-chart-new-ath-altcoin-boom-incoming/,"An altcoin season has been in the oven for quite some time now. And the latest breakout of the TOTAL2 chart could be one of the biggest confirmations that 10-100x gains are now closer than ever. The TOTAL2 chart, also known as the altcoin chart, tracks the total market capitalization of all the cryptos except Bitcoin. Just yesterday, it created a new all-time high, when it breached the $1.7T mark – its previous ATH that was set way back in November 2021. Both experts and everyday crypto enthusiasts are now looking at this as the perfect time to stack their portfolios with some low-cap, high-upside altcoins. Read on as we unpack more details about the upcoming alt season. Plus, we’ll also point you towards the best cryptos to buy right now . Historical Data Suggests Altcoin Market Cap Could Gain 260% The last time the TOTAL2 chart broke a major ATH was back in 2021, when it crossed the $475B mark set in 2017. That resulted in a 260% move after the breakout. And what’s happening right now looks so similar. How? Because this time too we’re breaking a 4-year long ATH. Merlijn The Trader, a crypto analyst with nearly 394K X followers, highlighted that the current breakout is coming from a long-drawn Cup and Handle pattern . According to classic technical analysis, we can measure the cup’s width and add that distance to the breakout point to calculate a potential target. This target comes out to be a whopping $6T, which happens to be a neat 260% gain from current levels. An extraordinary confluence! Looking to make the most of this altcoin season? Here are three of the best altcoins you should consider including in your portfolio. 1. Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) – New BTC Layer 2 for Speed, Scalability & Web3 Don’t mistake Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) for just another BTC-themed crypto looking to ride the altcoin boom. This new cryptocurrency project is filled to the brim with utility, seriousness, and backing from deep-pocketed investors. $HYPER is building a new Layer 2 solution for Bitcoin, aiming to solve the network’s long-standing issues of speed, cost, and programmability. Right now, Bitcoin is the slowest mainstream crypto. It processes just 7 transactions per second (TPS), as opposed to Solana’s 65K. $HYPER will act as a fast side lane, executing thousands of transactions at once, and that too, while retaining Bitcoin’s top-notch security. Plus, thanks to Bitcoin Hyper’s Solana Virtual Machine (SVM) integration, developers will now be able to build smart contracts and decentralized applications on Bitcoin. This will unlock a never-before-seen Web3 environment on Bitcoin, with DeFi trading, NFTs, lending, staking, swapping, DAOs, and gaming. Currently in presale, Bitcoin Hyper has already pulled in over $15.66M from early investors, with each token priced at just $0.012915. According to our Bitcoin Hyper price prediction , the token could hit $0.32 by year-end, churning out a mind-blowing 2,400% ROI. Interested? Here’s our detailed guide on how to buy Bitcoin Hyper . Visit $HYPER’s official website to learn how you can use its Canonical Bridge to interact with Bitcoin’s new Web3. 2. Snorter Token ($SNORT) – Powering a New Telegram Trading Bot for Meme Coin Sniping Snorter Token ($SNORT) , like Bitcoin Hyper, combines great memetic appeal (thanks to its wholesome aardvark) with a potentially revolutionary mission. $SNORT is the firepower behind Snorter Bot, a brand-new Telegram trading bot built to eliminate the dominance of crypto whales in the meme coin trading space. Snorter lets you place buy/sell trade orders well before liquidity kicks in. Then, it automatically executes those orders once liquidity arrives. The result? Retail participants can finally participate in early meme coin pumps, which is usually where the wildest gains come from. Even better? Snorter is just as secure as it is easy to use. In addition to safeguards against rug pulls and honeypots, the bot will also protect you from front-running and dangerous sandwich attacks. With over $3.9M in early funding so far, Snorter Token is undoubtedly one of the best low-cap coins to buy right now. 1 $SNORT is currently available for just $0.1043, and according to our Snorter Token price prediction , a $100 investment right now could turn into $900 by the end of 2025. Beyond handsome gains, buying $SNORT will also unlock advanced analytics, reduced trading fees (just 0.85%), staking rewards (currently 119%), and no daily sniping limits. Check out Snorter Token’s official website to find out all the benefits of this new Telegram trading bot. 3. Moo Deng ($MOODENG) – Viral Animal-Themed Meme Coin with a Fresh Breakout Moo Deng ($MOODENG) could be just the best meme coin to include in your crypto portfolio for the upcoming altcoin season. Complementing your portfolio with a pure hype-fueled meme coin like $MOODENG is a smart way to churn out outsized returns. Well, aren’t pure meme coins risky? Sure, but that’s why it’s advised to only allocate a small percentage of your portfolio to them. Moo Deng, in particular, is based on a viral cute-looking, playful baby pygmy hippopotamus named, well, Moo Deng. The token debuted in September 2024 and shot up nearly 3,000% in just a few weeks. Then came a deep correction. However, after an explosive May, $MOODENG is now looking extremely bullish. For instance, it has gained over 58% in just the last seven days. The best part? It has just broken out of a major resistance – a downward-sloping trendline – and now looks primed for at least a 300% rally from current levels. Want in? Buy $MOODENG on OKX , or any of the other crypto exchanges it’s listed on. Quick recap: The best way to make the most of the upcoming alt season is to load up on under-the-radar cryptos like Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) , Snorter Token ($SNORT) , and Moo Deng ($MOODENG).

The statement came during an interview with Anthony Pompiliano, where Visser declared: Between now and the end of the year, the allocations for Bitcoin for next year, from the traditional finance world, are going to increase. That is going to happen. — Jordi Visser, Official Youtube Interview Immediately after the statement, Pompiliano agreed with Visser, stating that ‘all the bears are wrong and they’re going to cry.’ However, Visser recognized that Bitcoin is stalling right now because of the low investor activity and the stagnation in the market as a whole. For Bitcoin to ramp up, it takes increased interest from investors, which Visser thinks it’s coming. Bitcoin Hyper’s ($HYPER) $15.6M presale will also contribute to Bitcoin’s marathon up the charts, as it promises to give us faster and cheaper Bitcoin transactions. Q4 Will Mark Bitcoin’s Rebirth Bitcoin has been stagnating in the $100K-$123K range since last December, with a few occasional dips below $80K. This is likely to change this coming Q4, with Bitcoin seeing increased investor interest and institutional and retail adoption. Strategy is leading the pack with 638,460 $BTC , valued at over $74B, but it’s not the only one with a growing treasury. According to Bitcoin Treasuries data , public companies hold 1,010,738 $BTC, almost a third of all holdings, currently at 3.71M Bitcoins. But it’s Strategy that delivers the most impactful punch with the largest Bitcoin reserve in the world by a large margin. By comparison, second place goes to MARA Holdings, with 52,477 $BTC, less than 10% of Strategy’s treasury. Michael Saylor, Strategy’s co-founder and chair executive, posted yesterday a short but punchy X post with the words ‘Bitcoin is more interesting than the Magnificent 7.’ He then followed it up with another tweet , where he highlighted Strategy’s return compared to the assets under the Mag 7 umbrella and, at 91%, MSTR is the clear winner. This explains why so many corporations and institutions try to replicate Strategy’s success and it puts Bitcoin’s long-term performance into perspective. An even more interesting perspective comes through Bitcoin Hyper’s lens, the Layer 2 upgrade that promises to give us a faster and cheaper Bitcoin starting 2026 and onward. Why Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) Promises Faster and Cheaper Bitcoin Transactions Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) tackles one of Bitcoin’s most pressing issues: its native performance limitation. The Bitcoin network is capped at 7 transactions per second (TPS), which causes it to lag behind so many modern ecosystems. For a clearer perspective, Bitcoin ranks 24th on the list of the fastest blockchains by TPS, Ethereum is 20th with 15 TPS, while Solana is third with almost 900 TPS and a 65,000 theoretical one. A change is necessary and Hyper is that change. Bitcoin Hyper relies on several tools to address this problem, with the Canonical Bridge and the Solana Virtual Machine (SVM) being among the most impactful. The Canonical Bridge mints the users’ Bitcoins into Hyper’s Layer 2 after the Bitcoin Relay Program verifies and confirms incoming transactions. Users can either use the wrapped Bitcoins on the Hyper layer or withdraw them to Bitcoin’s native network at will. Together with the Bitcoin Relay Program, the Canonical Bridge achieves several things: near-instant finality, higher scalability, no more network congestion. Because transactions essentially take place on the ultra-fast Hyper layer, the fee-based priority system, which forced smaller transactions at the end of the line, is also gone. No more waiting for hours for your transaction to go through. The Solana Virtual Machine complements this system by enabling the lightning-fast execution of smart contracts and DeFi apps, further pushing Bitcoin’s performance to higher standards. The $HYPER presale is now at over $15.6M, which already makes it one of the most successful presales of 2025. If you want to invest, now’s the time, given that Bitcoin is about to enter Q4, when it’ll likely experience increased investor activity. $BTC is already testing its $116K price point . $HYPER is now at $0.012915 , but we expect it to hit the markets hard post launch, especially since Hyper aims at a Q4 public listing. Based on the project’s utility and whitepaper, our price prediction for $HYPER is $0.32 by the end of the year and $1.50 by 2030, with sufficient community support and successful implementation. So, read our guide on how to buy $HYPER and go to the presale page to secure your spot in the $HYPER train. This isn’t financial advice. Do your own research (DYOR) and invest wisely.

Key Takeaways: Wall Street is expected to increase Bitcoin allocations by the end of 2025, according to strategist Jordi Visser. Institutional inflows into Bitcoin are accelerating, with ETFs and public companies holding over $117 billion in BTC. Visser sees bullish technical signals across crypto, pointing to broader momentum beyond just Bitcoin. “Between now and the end of the year, the allocations for Bitcoin from the traditional finance world are going to be increased,” Visser told Anthony Pompliano in a recent interview . “That is going to happen,” he added, underscoring his confidence in the shift. Visser: Wall Street Gearing Up for 2026 With Bigger Bitcoin Bets Visser believes traditional players are preparing now for 2026 and sees Bitcoin’s role expanding across institutional portfolios. His comments echo findings from a March 2025 Coinbase–EY Parthenon survey, which showed 83% of institutional investors plan to increase their crypto exposure next year. Bitwise, in a separate May report , projected up to $120 billion in Bitcoin inflows by 2025, and $300 billion by 2026. The timing of Visser’s forecast coincides with renewed strength in spot Bitcoin ETFs. US-based funds have pulled in roughly $2.33 billion in net inflows over the past week alone, bringing total inflows since their January launch to nearly $57 billion, according to Farside data. Public companies are also leaning further into Bitcoin. As of now, the combined holdings of Bitcoin across public firms total more than $117 billion, based on data from BitcoinTreasuries.NET. On the technical front, Visser said he’s been encouraged by recent chart activity. While avoiding a firm price prediction, he noted signs of “mini breakouts” across the broader crypto market. He highlighted Ethereum’s consolidation between $4,000 and $5,000, and suggested that a rally across the full ecosystem, including altcoins like Dogecoin and Sui, would confirm broader market momentum. The forecast arrives as Bitcoin continues to hover around $115,000, with traders debating whether a cycle peak is near or still ahead. Arthur Hayes Urges Bitcoin Investors to Think Long-Term As reported, BitMEX co-founder Arthur Hayes is pushing back against the short-term mindset dominating the crypto space, warning that many Bitcoin investors are too focused on quick gains. In a recent interview, Hayes criticized the obsession with instant wealth, stating that those expecting to buy a Lamborghini the day after buying Bitcoin are likely to be liquidated. While Bitcoin currently lags behind recent record highs in stocks and gold, Hayes dismissed comparisons as flawed. He argued that when adjusted for inflation and currency debasement, Bitcoin remains the top-performing asset, outperforming traditional markets in real terms. “Deflate things by Bitcoin,” he said, “you can’t even see them on the chart.” Despite market volatility, Hayes remains bullish on Bitcoin’s long-term trajectory. He previously predicted BTC could hit $250,000 by the end of 2025. Despite Hayes’ warning, young men are emerging as the dominant demographic in crypto ownership, viewing digital assets not just as investments, but as quick paths to wealth.

On-Chain Data Suggests It’s Happening,https://cryptopotato.com/did-a-whale-just-signal-a-pepe-bull-run-on-chain-data-suggests-its-happening/,"A whale has just made headlines across the crypto X community after making the largest PEPE purchase on Kraken ever. However, declining user activity, major investors selling off, and the influence of whales suggest it could be setting up for a risky pump-and-dump rather than a genuine bull run. Whale Scoops Up $16M in PEPE On-chain analytics platform Lookonchain identified the buy, revealing that a newly created wallet had acquired more than 1.52 trillion PEPE tokens worth almost $16 million from Kraken. X user bike4sai shared that it is an institutional-scale purchase on a major exchange and ranks among the largest single transactions in the token’s history. Community chatter suggests that this could be the spark that finally sends PEPE to the moon. Analysts are pointing to what they call a “falling wedge” pattern on the coin’s chart, a technical setup that often leads to big price jumps. This is also occurring against a backdrop of a broader meme coin revival, with social media sentiment having flipped positively. September has seen renewed interest in coins like PEPE and Little Pepe due to presale momentum. Crypto influencers are throwing around some crazy price targets, ranging from modest 2x or 3x gains to speculative 100x moves that would put PEPE right up there with the big dogs. Something Doesn’t Add Up While most people are getting excited about this whale buy, some red flags are popping up. Third-party data shows user activity is declining, with smart money and public figure investors dumping their tokens. That’s not what you typically see during a real bull run. Big whales are buying, but regular investors aren’t jumping in, which is a recipe for disaster. When a few large players control the market, sudden swings are always a risk. Past meme coin cycles have shown the pattern clearly: whales buy in, retail traders rush to follow, and then whales sell off, leaving smaller investors with losses. The current situation around PEPE has similarities. This record-breaking purchase on Kraken may not signal the start of a bull run. Instead, it could be positioning for a pump-and-dump, with the whale using hype to attract interest before selling into the momentum. Typically, major investors avoid moves that attract this much attention. Only time will tell if this Kraken whale has genuinely started the next major PEPE rally, or if retail investors are about to learn another painful and costly lesson about following whale moves blindly.

The BitMEX co-founder has spent the better part of the past years investing in memecoins like PEPE and MOTHER. In a recent interview with crypto investor Kyle Chasse, Hayes stated that digital assets are too risky for the kind of capital he wants to deploy. The entrepreneur revealed that he’s interested in projects that are going to pay investors as token holders for making them successful. Hayes advocates for DeFi protocols Hayes has previously advocated for DeFi protocols, including EtherFi, Ethena, and Hyperliquid, saying he believes they could soar as stablecoin adoption surges. He also believes they could rise as yield-seeking capital floods the sector. The former CEO of BitMEX revealed that his 2028 target is to achieve returns of over 100x. He also said he’s projecting a 34x move for EtherFi, 51x for Ethena, and up to 130x for Hyperliquid. Hayes cited real revenue, product-market fit, and a model that returns value to token holders instead of just VCs and insiders. “Investors have punished projects that either never made any money or made money and didn’t give it to tokenholders. We don’t want to touch it.” – Arthur Hayes , Co-Founder of BitMEX. The equity derivatives trader also maintained that he’s not abandoning Bitcoin, saying that the digital asset has been the single-best performing asset of the money-printing era. Hayes believes BTC could climb as high as $700,000 before the decade is out. The crypto investor argued that the real asymmetric upside for Bitcoin currently lies further down the curve in DeFi protocols. He believes they can capture the tens of trillions of dollars he expects to flow into stablecoins and on-chain markets. Hayes also urged Bitcoin holders to be more patient and stop worrying about stocks and gold hitting record highs. He argued that asking why Bitcoin isn’t higher misses the point of investing in cryptocurrencies. Hayes told Chasse that traders who are buying Bitcoin, thinking they can buy a Lamborghini the next day, will probably get liquidated. He said it is not the right way to think about things, especially the digital asset market. Hayes pushes back against narrative of Bitcoin lagging Hayes pointed out frustrations from recent BTC buyers who are asking why the asset’s price isn’t rising to $150,000 yet. He called out those traders who bought Bitcoin six months ago, saying that anyone who bought it two, three, five, or 10 years ago is laughing at them. He argued that investors need to adjust their perspective on Bitcoin. Curvo shows that Bitcoin has had an average annualized return of 82,4% over the past decade. At the time of publication, Bitcoin is up nearly 5% in the past seven days and is currently exchanging hands at $115,775. The digital asset is still down from its all-time high of $124,290. Meanwhile, gold reached a new all-time high of $3,674 this week, and is currently exchanging hands at $3,643 per ounce. The S&P 500 also set a record closing high this week of 6,587. The former BitMEX CEO dismissed the significance of these highs relative to Bitcoin after Chasse asked about when Bitcoin and the broader crypto market might start attracting more flows from the global M2 money supply after stocks and gold hit new all-time highs. Hayes argued that the premise of the question was flawed, adding that BTC is the best-performing asset in terms of currency debasement. Don’t just read crypto news. Understand it.

The surge comes amid renewed institutional activity, record DeFi engagement, and technical momentum that has traders eyeing whether the rally can extend toward the $260–$270 range. DeFi Growth and Whale Activity Lift Solana Much of Solana’s rally is driven by a sharp rise in on-chain activity. The network’s Total Value Locked (TVL) in DeFi protocols has surpassed $12 billion, its highest level on record. This growth underscores Solana’s increasing role in decentralized lending, trading, and staking platforms. At the same time, large investors have been quietly building positions. Whales are accumulating. Multicoin moved over $680M in SOL on-chain, and institutional involvement is strong. This is good for long-term Solana adoption. TVL over $12B in DeFi protocols Multicoin moved $680M in SOL on-chain Whale accumulation is bullish Institutional Buys and Macro Tailwinds Solana’s rally also gained fuel from Galaxy Digital’s $1.16 billion purchase of SOL, most of which was transferred to Coinbase. The move reinforced confidence in the token’s liquidity and institutional backing. Galaxy Digital is helping Forward Industries acquire $1.65B worth of $SOL . In the past 12 hours, Galaxy Digital has withdrawn 1,452,392 $SOL ($326M) from exchanges. According to an announcement, Forward Industries recently completed a $1.65B private placement to fund the… pic.twitter.com/cdLFmYcSHq — Lookonchain (@lookonchain) September 11, 2025 Macro conditions are also playing a role. Traders expect the Federal Reserve to deliver a 25-basis-point rate cut, which could provide further support for risk assets, including cryptocurrencies. Combined with Solana’s strong fundamentals, the environment is setting the stage for potential follow-through into year-end. Solana (SOL/USD) Technical Outlook: Bulls Eye $260 Next Technically, Solana price prediction continues to strengthen. Trading at $247.82 with a market cap above $134 billion, the token is pressing against the $250 resistance zone, historically a difficult barrier. On the 4-hour chart, SOL remains inside an ascending channel, printing higher lows while respecting its trendline support. The 50-EMA at $222 and the 200-EMA at $192 both slope upward, confirming underlying strength. Solana Price Chart – Source: Tradingview The RSI at 77 shows overbought conditions, but history suggests sustained rallies can hold elevated levels. Recent candlestick patterns resemble a three white soldiers formation, a bullish continuation signal. If Solana clears $250 with conviction, targets extend to $260 and $270. A pullback to $244 or $235 would be a healthy retest, $222 EMA is the structural floor. For traders, long above $244 with a stop $227. For long-term holders, this rally might not be short-lived and could be building up to $300 if institutional flows continue. Presale Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) Combines BTC Security With Solana Speed Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) is positioning itself as the first Bitcoin-native Layer 2 powered by the Solana Virtual Machine (SVM). Its goal is to expand the BTC ecosystem by enabling lightning-fast, low-cost smart contracts, decentralized apps, and even meme coin creation. By combining BTC’s unmatched security with Solana’s high-performance framework, the project opens the door to entirely new use cases, including seamless BTC bridging and scalable dApp development. The team has put strong emphasis on trust and scalability, with the project audited by Consult to give investors confidence in its foundations. Momentum is building quickly. The presale has already crossed $15.6 million, leaving only a limited allocation still available. At today’s stage, HYPER tokens are priced at just $0.012915—but that figure will increase as the presale progresses. You can buy HYPER tokens on the official Bitcoin Hyper website using crypto or a bank card.

The Yala team promptly addressed the incident on X (formerly Twitter), confirming the attack and its impact on the YU stablecoin’s price stability. “ Our protocol recently experienced an attempted attack that briefly impacted YU’s peg, ” the team said.

The team assured users that all assets remain secure while they focus on restoring stability and strengthening protocol security. After the announcement, YU, designed to maintain a stable $1 value, fluctuated between $0.798 and $0.996. Source: DexScreener Currently, only $784,000 in USDC liquidity exists in the YU stablecoin pool on Ethereum. The Yala team has temporarily disabled the Convert and Bridge functions to ensure complete stability during system improvements. In a September 14 X post , the team stated, “All other protocol functions remain unaffected, and user assets remain safe. We’ll share more updates once maintenance is complete.” As part of ongoing security enhancement and system upgrades, the Convert and Bridge functions will be temporarily unavailable to ensure full stability while improvements are applied. All other protocol functions remain unaffected, and user assets remain safe. We'll share more… — Yala (@yalaorg) September 14, 2025 However, according to Lookonchain , the suspected Yala stablecoin attacker minted 120 million YU tokens on Polygon and sold 7.71 million across Ethereum and Solana for 7.7 million USDC. The USDC was then swapped for 1,501 ETH and distributed across multiple wallets. Source: Polygonscan The hacker still holds 22.29 million YU on Ethereum and Solana, with 90 million YU remaining on Polygon. YU holders are now in panic mode as the stablecoin has plunged more than 22% since the incident, raising doubts about whether it can regain its peg. A stablecoin’s core function is maintaining a 1:1 “peg” to fiat currency value; without this peg, the fundamental purpose fails. YU operates as an over-collateralized stablecoin, meaning it’s backed by digital asset reserves (BTC) that exceed the stablecoin’s own value. With YU still struggling to maintain its peg, Yala faces a critical period for securing user trust and industry confidence. At roughly $140M market cap, YU remains small compared to established stablecoins like Tether (USDT) and Circle (USDC), which hold $170 billion and $73 billion market capitalizations, respectively. Even newer stablecoins like Ethena (USDe) and WLFI (USD1) command $13.5 billion and $5.8 billion valuations, respectively. However, YU’s peg struggles aren’t the first of their kind in the crypto market. Even Tether’s USDT temporarily lost its dollar peg in 2023 when two major trading pools became heavily imbalanced. Tether CTO Paolo Ardoino explained that volatile stablecoin markets create opportunities for attackers to exploit liquidity pool imbalances. More recently, in April, synthetic stablecoin sUSD, long pegged to the U.S. dollar within the Synthetix ecosystem, dramatically lost its peg , dropping to $0.68. Unlike YU, sUSD didn’t face an attack. Instead, its depeg resulted from the protocol’s transition to new debt and collateralization mechanisms under SIP-420 , designed to improve capital efficiency. @synthetix_io ’s sUSD stablecoin crashes to $0.68, exposing algorithmic peg vulnerabilities and sparking DeFi stability concerns amid protocol changes. #Stablecoin #DeFi https://t.co/u3kSo3zZTD — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) April 18, 2025 Rather than enhancing efficiency, the code upgrade accidentally dismantled key mechanisms that previously maintained sUSD’s dollar peg. Why Do Billion-Dollar Stablecoins Keep Losing Their Peg? In October 2023, TrueUSD, a major fiat-collateralized stablecoin, lost its peg after announcing suspended minting activities through technology partner Prime Trust. Many TUSD holders interpreted the minting suspension as evidence that the company couldn’t maintain adequate fiat collateral backing. The dramatic collapse of terraUSD (UST) and the entire Terra (LUNA) ecosystem in 2022 continues to cast doubt on stablecoin reliability. Terra founder Do Kwon and the Luna Foundation Guard spent up to 80,000 bitcoin , worth approximately $9.2 billion, in an attempt to defend UST’s dollar peg before ultimately failing. Former People’s Bank of China Governor Zhou Xiaochuan has now warned that stablecoins face a one-in-three collapse probability over the next decade due to crisis-induced arbitrage failures. He cautioned that even fully-backed stablecoins can amplify risk through deposit-lending, collateralized financing, and asset trading activities. Stablecoins aren’t all the same. We see “$1” across USDC, USDT, PYUSD, FDUSD, crvUSD, GHO… Not every “$1” is created equal. The difference? Settlement. Who can redeem, how fast, and at what quality of reserves. Let’s break down stablecoin fragmentation & why settlement risk… pic.twitter.com/oqqM9QjkMg — DOLAK1NG (@DOLAK1NG) September 12, 2025 Zhou criticized inadequate reserve custody standards, citing Facebook’s early plans to self-custody Libra assets as a problematic design. While the Hong Kong Stablecoin Ordinance and U.S. GENIUS Act address some concerns, Zhou noted that regulatory gaps remain. He recommended compiling actual circulation data to assess redemption risks, calling current oversight frameworks “far from sufficient.” The post Polychain-Backed Yala Stablecoin YU Crashes to $0.20 After Protocol Attack appeared first on Cryptonews .",Blockchain News|Stablecoin,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|BLOCKCHAIN|USDT|FIAT|MARKET|USDC|ETH,"{'name': 'cryptonews', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptonews.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptonews,2025-09-14 11:27:22

Situated at the intersection of decentralized lending and sustainable-yield models, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is gaining momentum as it transforms Ethereum’s DeFi network use. Mutuum Finance presale is already in Phase 6 with tokens worth $0.035. MUTM has already collected over $15.68M and investors in the project are already more than 16,280. Mutuum Finance promises to deliver 300%+ ROI when live. Ethereum Moves Closer to $4,500 on News of Rate Cut Interest Ethereum (ETH) is at around $4,525, with a 24-hour range of around $4,451 to $4,534. The market is patiently awaiting drivers in the form of upcoming rate reductions, institutional ETF purchases, and layer-2 scaling upgrades which can drive ETH to $5,000. Though all these drivers are being given top billing space, new DeFi projects such as Mutuum Finance are also gathering momentum on the radar of crypto investors. Mutuum Finance: Risk Mechanisms and Protocol Security Mutuum Finance boasts strong protection mechanisms for all assets collateralized to ensure the protocol’s safety as well as the users. These include borrowing limits, deposit limits, and target collateral rates. To ensure systemic stability, liquidators are rewarded to close undercollateralized positions, and trigger penalties and liquidation enforce timely remediation. Collateral effectiveness is optimized in the correlated assets, i.e., the borrowing capacity increases proportionally with Loan-to-Value (LTV) levels in heavily secured lending. Reserve factors are also provided as insurance under extraordinary market conditions, and higher reserves are levied on risky assets to nullify volatility. Phase 6 Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Token Presale Mutuum Finance (MUTM) presale has already reached more than 16,280 investors and $15.68 million with big demand. On its quest for increased security and transparency, the project is launching a $50,000 USDT Bug Bounty Program in collaboration with CertiK. Through the program, developers and researchers are rewarded for identifying vulnerabilities, with the reward established on four levels of severity: critical, major, minor, and low. Dynamic Interest Rate Adjustments Mutuum Finance is founded on a floating interest rate mechanism, which fluctuates with the liquidity level. Borrowing is cheap when there is high liquidity, and this enables higher usage. Borrowing is expensive when there are liquidity shortages, which enables loan repayment as well as increased deposits. This feature promotes balance in the system while preventing excessive borrowing. Greater Security by Borrowing Controls The protocol attains nearly identical collateral amounts, borrowing, and supply to minimize risk. Overcollateralization and liquidator incentives cause undercollateralized positions to settle rapidly to maintain insolvency risk exposure under control. High-correlated assets have increased collateral efficiency, whereas riskier tokens see reduced borrowing caps, offsetting liquidity provision against risk minimization. Keeping Market Volatility Under Control and Sustaining Liquidity Mutuum Finance is extremely sensitive to maintaining an appropriate on-chain liquidity to avoid liquidation of low-slippage, bad-quality positions. Liquidation thresholds and LTV ratios are precisely tuned to the underlying asset’s volatility. Less volatile, more stable tokens have larger borrow sizes and less aggressive liquidation thresholds, whereas riskier, more volatile tokens have tighter parameters. Along with other safeguarding measures, liquidators are rewarded with higher compensation in periods of lower liquidity, offering stable risk management even in conditions of stress markets. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is one of the best Ethereum-based DeFi projects to have on your watchlist as ETH approaches $5,000. Stage 6 tokens are priced at $0.035 today with over $15.68M already raised and 16,280+ investors already committed. Experts forecast a minimum of 300% returns when MUTM goes live based on robust demand and building momentum. Dynamic interest rate model, $50K CertiK bug bounty, and risk controls make the platform scalable, secure, and yield-generative in one. Lock in Stage 6 tokens today before the next price jump.

New numbers from The Conference Board show that most employers are planning an average salary increase of just 3.4%, matching this year’s bump. That’s despite rising prices, a shaky job market , and growing anxiety about job security in Trump’s second term in office. Mitchell Barnes, economist at The Conference Board, explained that what’s happening isn’t a pullback but a reshuffling. “Today’s labor market is one of reorientation, not retreat,” Barnes said in an interview with Yahoo Finance. He added that companies are still giving out raises, but some are cutting back on signing and retention bonuses, choosing instead to spend smarter. About 60% of businesses surveyed blamed economic uncertainty for the cautious salary moves and slower hiring. Employers hold off on new hires, focus on existing staff Across the board, employers say they’re taking longer to fill jobs that became vacant in the last six months. Many of those who quit haven’t been replaced. Some companies that issued temporary layoffs are now making those cuts permanent. Instead of chasing new hires, some employers are choosing to build from within. Barnes said that 16% of companies surveyed plan to spend more on skill-building programs for their current staff in 2026. Meanwhile, data from Payscale supports a similar forecast. Their survey found that U.S. employers expect a 3.5% average raise in 2026, slightly below the 3.6% increase in 2025. But the bigger story is in the breakdown: Only 16% of employers said they’re increasing their salary budgets. Most, around 70%, will keep budgets flat, and a small number are actually cutting back. Ruth Thomas, Payscale’s chief compensation officer, says the reasoning has changed. “It’s not surprising that pay budgets are trending lower this year, based on a cooling labor market,” Ruth said. “What is maybe more surprising is just how much economic concerns have now overtaken labor competition as the primary driver of compensation decisions – 66% of employers cite this as the reason for pulling back, up 17 percentage points from last year.” Compare this to 2023, when employers were scrambling for talent. According to Payscale, base salary increases hit 4.8% that year — the highest jump in two decades. But the mood is different now. Ruth said organizations are under pressure from inflation, interest rates, and fears of another recession, and they’re focusing more on cost control than growth. Wages stall while prices rise and workers grow anxious Even though salary gains are slowing down, the cost of living isn’t. Inflation is still climbing. The Consumer Price Index rose 2.9% year-over-year in August, the fastest pace since January. The biggest pain points are food and electricity, which have both gotten more expensive. And tariffs under Trump’s trade policies have pushed up prices on clothes, furniture, and other household goods. The job market is also showing signs of weakness. In August, the U.S. economy added just 22,000 jobs, far below the 75,000 expected by analysts. The unemployment rate went up to 4.3%, a small rise from 4.2%, but still enough to cause concern. Initial jobless claims hit 263,000, the highest since 2021 — a clear signal that layoffs are starting to tick up. That fear is showing up in worker sentiment. A new survey from the New York Federal Reserve found that more people now expect to lose their jobs or see unemployment rise in the next 12 months. Anxiety is rising just as wage growth stalls. Some sectors are still seeing better outcomes. Science, engineering, and government jobs are expected to see raises above 4%, according to Payscale’s projections. But that’s the exception, not the rule. For most workers, that 3.4% raise won’t keep up with rising costs.

According to reports, the Pakistan Virtual Asset Regulatory Authority (PVARA) has invited Expressions of Interest (EoI) from leading exchanges and Virtual Asset Service Providers (VASPs). The country said it wants the global crypto exchanges to participate in the emerging digital economy of the country. Established under the Virtual Assets Ordinance 2025 (Ordinance No. VII of 2025), PVARA is charged with formalizing and regulating virtual assets in line with the international standards set by the Financial Action Task Force (FATF), IMF, and World Bank. The ordinance, released on July 8 and published in the Gazette of Pakistan on July 9, allows the authority to license, regulate, and supervise the platforms, ensuring strong anti-money laundering (AML), counter-terrorism financing (CFT), and cybersecurity frameworks. Pakistan wants partners for its digital economy The finance ministry issued a statement on Saturday, highlighting the feat that it has achieved concerning the virtual asset market in Pakistan. According to the statement, the virtual asset market already has more than 40 million users with annual trading volumes estimated to be about $300 billion, making it one of the biggest untapped markets in the world. “This EoI is our invitation to the world’s leading VASPs to partner in building a transparent and inclusive digital financial future for Pakistan,” said Bilal bin Saqib, chairman of PVARA and minister of state for crypto and blockchain. In the statement, it mentioned that eligibility will only be restricted to VASPs and crypto exchanges already licensed under recognized international regulations worldwide. Some of these regulators include the United States Securities and Exchange Commission, the United Kingdom Financial Conduct Autho­rity, the European Union’s VASP framework, the United Arab Emirates’ Virtual Assets Regu­la­tory Authority, and the Mone­tary Authority of Singapore (MAS). Applicants are also expected to demonstrate that they are in compliance with AML, CFT, and know-your-customer (KYC) standards. Strict guidelines to enter the program released In the submissions, the platforms are expected to attach their full company profile, licensing details with jurisdiction and authorities, services offered, including trading, custody, technology, and security protocols, assets under management, revenue, and compliance history. Applicants are also expected to outline a proposal showing the kind of business model they will be operating in Pakistan .

Crypto analyst Hailey LUNC, known for her insightful market predictions, has recently forecasted an imminent breakout for XRP, targeting a price surge to $20 or higher. This bold prediction has garnered attention across the cryptocurrency community, sparking discussions about XRP's potential trajectory. Hailey LUNC's analysis highlights a significant bullish pattern forming in XRP's price chart. She points to a double bottom formation and an ascending triangle, technical indicators that often precede substantial upward movements. According to her, these patterns suggest that XRP is on the verge of a breakout, with the potential to reach the $20 mark. Supporting this outlook, other analysts have also identified similar bullish signals. For instance, XForceGlobal, another crypto analyst, has set a $20 target for XRP, citing the cryptocurrency's current consolidation phase and the potential for a strong upward movement. He notes that XRP's price action is aligning with the Elliott Wave Theory , indicating the possibility of a significant rally. Notably, XRP might be gaining momentum toward the $3.60 breakout as renewed buying follows its return to the Bloomberg Galaxy Crypto Index. Therefore, the anticipation surrounding XRP is fueled by broader market developments. Speculation about the approval of a spot XRP ETF has increased, with some analysts suggesting that such an event could unlock substantial capital inflows, further propelling XRP's price toward the $20 target. Whether this prediction materializes remains to be seen, with XRP currently trading at $3.07. On-Chain Data Sparks Rumors of BlackRock Quietly Accumulating XRP via Coinbase Custody A wave of speculation has swept across the XRP community following a viral video from Crypto X AiMan, who argued that recent on-chain movements may signal that BlackRock is quietly buying XRP via Coinbase Custody. According to data highlighted in AiMan’s post, Coinbase’s visible XRP reserves plunged from about 780 million tokens to less than 200 million between June and August 2025, a reduction of roughly 69%. AiMan emphasized that, despite appearances, this was not a mass sell-off. He noted that Coinbase reduced the number of wallets holding XRP from 52 to around 10–16, each with nearly identical balances of 16.5 million XRP. This uniform distribution strongly suggests technical reallocation or custody restructuring rather than open-market selling. The rumors connecting BlackRock to these transfers stem from Coinbase’s institutional partnerships. Coinbase provides custody infrastructure for large clients through Coinbase Prime, integrated with BlackRock’s Aladdin platform. This setup allows BlackRock and other institutional investors to gain exposure to digital assets, potentially including XRP, without those holdings being visible on public exchanges. Market analysts argue that the drop in Coinbase’s exchange wallets may simply indicate assets being moved into segregated custody accounts for institutional clients. What can be verified today is clear that Coinbase’s XRP holdings have declined sharply on-chain, and its wallet structure has been consolidated. It is equally verifiable that Coinbase and BlackRock maintain an active custody partnership. What cannot be confirmed is whether BlackRock itself is buying XRP. Neither the asset manager nor Coinbase has issued disclosures tying BlackRock directly to XRP purchases, and no regulatory filings provide supporting evidence. Fact-checks by independent sources stress that while institutional reallocation is likely, attributing it specifically to BlackRock remains speculative. Conclusion The sharp decline in Coinbase’s visible XRP reserves and the consolidation of its wallets point to institutional-level movements rather than retail activity. While BlackRock’s existing partnership with Coinbase fuels the theory of quiet accumulation, no concrete evidence links the world’s largest asset manager directly to XRP purchases. Meanwhile, Hailey LUNC’s bold $20 XRP forecast underscores growing optimism around the token’s technical setup and potential catalysts like an ETF approval.",News|Ripple,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|XRP|EXCHANGE|TRADING|MARKET,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-09-14 11:53:43
51709094,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=808190,1757851043,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/51709094.jpeg,How will markets move after Federal Reserve cuts rates on Wednesday?,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/what-happens-after-fed-rate-cut-on-wednesday/,"On Wednesday, the Federal Reserve will lower interest rates for the first time this year, citing damage in the labor market as the main reason behind the decision. This will make 2025 only the third year since 1996 that the Fed has introduced rate cuts with the S&P 500 trading at all-time highs. That part is unusual, since rate cuts typically arrive during downturns. But right now, the U.S. economy is still growing, stocks are pumping , and inflation hasn’t cooled. The number of Americans saying jobs are easy to get dropped to 34.1% in August, the lowest number in four years and a 22-point decline since 2023. While Fed chair Jay Powell leans on labor as justification, everything else looks wild, with core inflation hitting 3.1% in August, way above the Fed’s long-term 2% goal. On the growth front, GDP is still expanding at more than 3% a year, which isn’t the kind of data that usually calls for rate relief. Rate cut collides with record-level stock rally Meanwhile, the S&P 500 just posted its 24th record high this year, as Cryptopolitan reported . Since bottoming in April, the index has climbed more than 35%, making this run one of the strongest five-month surges in recent history, rivaling the rebound after the 2008 financial crash. Despite those numbers, Powell is expected to announce a 25 basis point cut on Wednesday. But the Federal Reserve did the same thing in 2019 and 2024, and each time, the stock market didn’t panic. When the Fed eases within 2% of the all-time high, stocks tend to go higher a year later. Data from Carson Research shows that in all 20 similar cases, the S&P 500 was up 12 months after, with an average gain of 13.9%. But the short-term is a different story. In the month after a rate cut like this, the S&P has dropped 11 out of 22 times. That’s not nothing. Those down months were most common in the late ’80s and early ’90s. Some analysts expect this week’s cut to follow the same pattern: a rocky 30 days, then a stronger year ahead. The environment is also different now. Rate cuts are landing in the middle of the AI boom. The market is already pricing in faster growth, rising productivity, and expanding margins. But inflation hasn’t backed off, which means lower rates could push everything even higher. Crypto and commodities surge ahead of the Fed As Cryptopolitan previously reported , Bitcoin and gold are already moving. Both have been rising in a straight line over the past few weeks, pricing in the reality that lower rates in a hot economy mean higher asset prices. Gold has made several all-time highs, while Bitcoin stays stuck under $120,000, though its demand has remained sky-high. All that started long before the Fed’s decision, and it’s being reinforced by every inflation print and every tech breakout. “Markets are already reacting to the liquidity flood,” said Ryan Detrick, Chief Market Strategist at Carson Group. “The trend is clear. When the Fed eases during strong growth, long-term assets benefit.” One of the stock market’s best performers last session was the Winklevoss twins’ crypto exchange Gemini Space Station, which debuted on Nasdaq Friday. The stock opened at $37.01 on the Nasdaq, about 32% above where its IPO was priced at $28. At one point, shares traded as high as $45.89. The stock closed higher by 14.3%, at $32.

BITF's cautious approach contrasts with peers like MARA and RIOT, favoring minimal dilution, active BTC sales, and manageable debt over aggressive expansion and large BTC holdings. The company’s growth is centered on strategic diversification and capital efficiency, with a robust liquidity position and phased HPC/AI infrastructure plans. Despite recent share price rally and crypto market momentum, I maintain a Hold rating on BITF, prioritizing fundamentals over speculative upside. This article is a follow-up on Bitfarms Ltd. (BITF) (BITF:CA), since I last covered it in May this year. The last piece I published on Bitfarms was titled “ Bitfarms: Q1 Was A Strategic Reset .” In Q1, Bitfarms was forced to close operations in certain locations, like Argentina. Then, the groundwork for the pivot to high-performance computing [HPC]/AI hosting was under early planning and feasibility studies. The groundwork for the pivot then focused on moving capacity to the U.S. and securing power pipelines. I took a cautious Hold stance in the last coverage of BITF because losses persisted, the pivot was still in an early stage of execution, and the Argentina exit raised impairment risk, which could make operating losses persist for the coming quarters. Since my last coverage, BITF has rallied over 100%, mainly because of the share buyback program announced in July and, more recently, on the back of the broader momentum in the crypto market, which is spilling over to crypto stocks. The crypto market is currently seeing active momentum, which has extended to Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) miners. Miners that have made their transition path to HPC/AI hosting clear and already demonstrated an energy pipeline with sites under development or exclusivity have shown stronger momentum that is beginning to look more sustainable. Despite BITF’s upside since I last covered it in May and the recent rally this week, I'm still leaning towards a cautious Hold rating - I'll outline the key reasons for this stance as we go along in this piece. BITF remains a promising Bitcoin miner and HPC contender (as the pivot takes shape) and won't qualify for an immediate Sell. But for investors who already hold BITF, I think holding or trimming into strength makes sense. And I think an upgrade to a Buy just based on the recent rally is tantamount to unhealthy speculation and is more driven by chasing green candles than sound analysis based on fundamentals. Bitfarms - The Strategic Reset Is Still Underway I viewed Bitfarms' Q1 as an initial strategic reset phase. And that reset also spilled over into Q2, influencing operations and financials on some fronts. Q2 saw some cost and impairment pressure, as the shutdown of operations in Argentina and related impairment deepened the operating loss. Q2 headline earnings quality didn't improve much compared to the revenue growth. Revenue grew 87% YoY to $78 million, while net loss was $29 million. Bitfarms is also an active seller of its mined BTC to create ongoing liquidity to fund operations; hence, it has not been in the same league as miners with substantial Bitcoin holdings who have enjoyed headline net income numbers due to fair value gains on their Bitcoin holdings. Bitfarms sold 1,052 BTC in Q2 at an average price of $95,500, which generated $100 million in proceeds. An additional 85 BTC were sold in July , generating $10 million. These proceeds fund the company's ongoing capex and growth initiatives, and even the share buyback program in which 4.9 million shares have already been purchased. I believe Bitfarms' treasury management approach of holding less BTC on the balance sheet should be one of the first key distinctions that should influence investors’ decision on investing in BITF, before even a deeper dive into other operational and financial metrics. Do you want pure-play exposure to a Bitcoin-heavy balance sheet, or do you want proactive capitalization on Bitcoin price gains for growth and operational efficiency? Because of the active sale of mined BTC, Bitfarms relies on much less dilutive capital raises compared to peers that pursue a full treasury hold strategy. Bitfarms had an equity raise on January 24 this year when 14.4 million common shares were issued under an ATM equity offering for net proceeds of ~$24 million, being all the shares Bitfarms has issued to date in 2025. Compared to miners who hold their mined BTC on their balance sheet and whose Bitcoin mining expansion and HPC/AI pivots have been more aggressive, dilution has been more manageable for Bitfarms. Peers like MARA Holdings ( MARA ) and Riot Platforms ( RIOT ) have announced a series of dilutive raises this year via ATM programs and convertible note offerings. These peers all have one thing in common: they hold most of their mined Bitcoin on their balance sheet, and their hosting expansion or pivot to HPC/AI has been more aggressive and ambitious. Bitfarms seems like the miner that treads more carefully. While the peers like MARA and RIOT have pursued aggressive strategies through dilutive capital raises, the scale of their physical expansion tells a similar story. For example, MARA’s stated global growth pipeline exceeds 3 GW, with a target of 75 EH/s mining capacity by the end of this year. RIOT is similarly focused on an ambitious, single-site expansion with hashrate targets of 40 EH/s by the end of 2025 and 45 EH/s in early 2026. If an aggressive growth strategy and a huge BTC stash on the balance sheet are your priority, which invariably increases risk exposure, then BITF might not be an appealing stock. But if capital discipline appeals to you, BITF remains one of the Bitcoin miners with that disciplined quality. That quality has also been infused into the company's HPC/AI expansion, which seems to be taking a more measured approach in execution. Bitfarms' overall pipeline size and the phased nature of its development - the confirmed 50 MW in 2026 and 300 MW in 2027 for its Panther Creek campus - is more conservative compared to a peer like Hut 8’s ( HUT ) multi-gigawatt ambitions and rapid project maturation. HUT currently has over 10,000 MW gross pipeline and around 3,100 MW under exclusivity (I went into detail on HUT’s ambitious pipeline in a separate HUT analysis published yesterday , September 12, here on Seeking Alpha) Bitfarms' total energy pipeline is around 1.3 GW. Though it can still be considered a significant size, the company has a different strategic focus based on how its execution is going. The company is not aiming for the highest hashrate or energy capacity but rather reallocating its megawatts toward HPC and AI infrastructure in North America, as evidenced by its acquisitions and site planning. This makes the company's growth less about mining and energy scale and more about a strategic diversification, which holds potential for superior economics per megawatt when paired with the minimal dilution and less debt. Data by YCharts In its pivot to HPC/AI, Bitfarms has a clear and funded plan for that expansion, which includes a $300 million Macquarie financing facility with an 8% interest. It also has an expected $18 million in proceeds from the Argentina closure from equipment sales, recovery of prepaid deposits, and others. Bitfarms also boasts a robust liquidity position of $230 million as of Q2 end. Another attraction is that, despite not being excessively dilution-heavy, debt is also well-managed. Debt-to-equity compared to peers also shows a healthy leverage profile, which ties back to the ongoing sales of the mined Bitcoin, helping to provide ongoing liquidity for operation and expansion. Takeaway Bitfarms is still in an active strategic reset phase. The planned closure of operations in Argentina is expected to be completed in November this year. The HPC pivot is also early-stage, compared to a peer like HUT that has seen site announcements and has a pipeline already under exclusivity. Bitfarms announced the partnership with T5 Data Centers for the HPC infrastructure build-out at the Panther Creek campus just last month, in which pre-construction design planning and development approval processes will be the next steps to advance Bitfarms' digital infrastructure investment and pivot to HPC/AI. While Bitfarms' balance sheet quality is coupled with the minimal dilution and manageable debt profile, which makes its capital structure less risky in terms of shareholder value erosion, I still believe beyond a broader crypto market momentum (which we are currently experiencing), most investors in crypto stocks would naturally gravitate towards miners seeing visible expansion in both hashrate and power capacity, especially those with shorter execution timelines, even if those miners are more heavy on dilution. To be an investor in crypto-related stocks means being inherently risk-tolerant. A miner that tries to play it safe might not be appealing to the broader crypto equities investor base, especially in a time of market momentum where expansion and execution outweigh prudence and where investors reward boldness and visibility. Also, considering that these periods of momentum are typically short-lived, Bitcoin mining companies with immediate growth visibility will be more attractive and likely command higher premiums. Based on these, I'm reiterating a Hold for BITF.",BTC-USD|MARA|RIOT|HUT|HUT:CA|BITF|BITF:CA,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|BTC|BUSINESS|MINING|TRADING,"{'name': 'Seeking Alpha', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/seekingalpha.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",seekingalpha,2025-09-14 12:00:00

Despite the waves of skepticism experienced in the past, there seems to have been a recent major shift in investor behavior, which shows a level of optimism in the potential growth of the Ether token. Ethereum Netflow Across Exchanges Consistently Negative In a September 13 post on social media platform X, on-chain analyst Darkfost revealed how Ethereum’s investors have been acting behind the scenes over the past few months. Related Reading: Dogecoin Breaks Out With A 32% Surge: Time To Buy Or Too Late To Chase? According to Darkfost, there has been a major shift in investor behavior since Ethereum’s last price drop from $4,000 to $1,500. At the time, the prevailing investor mood was fear, uncertainty, and doubt (FUD) — emotions which did not play so much of a role in affecting the long-term activity of investors. Darkfost reported that the netflow across all exchanges has been “consistently negative” since the major Ethereum price drop; this means that more ETH is leaving exchanges than they are being deposited. According to the on-chain analyst, around 56,000 ETH is being withdrawn daily over an average of 30 days. Interestingly, this figure has not been seen since the depths of the last bear market. Recently, there have been days when more than 400,000 ETH were withdrawn. What is more interesting is that the exchange netflows have not turned positive since July. As earlier inferred, this trend of token movement represents a shift in the holding behavior of Ethereum investors, as they move their assets off trading platforms to non-custodial wallets for long-term storage. Ultimately, this suggests that holders are becoming increasingly confident in the ETH’s long-term promise. As of this writing, the Ether token is valued at around $4,660, reflecting no significant price change in the past 24 hours. According to data from CoinGecko, the price of Ethereum has increased by almost 10% in the past seven days. BTC And ETH Reserves Drop 23% And 20% Respectively In a separate post, Darkfost analyzed the Bitcoin and Ethereum Exchange Reserve metrics across all exchanges and estimated how much of these cryptocurrencies have left exchanges in 2025. According to the online pundit, Bitcoin reserves across all exchanges have dropped by almost a quarter of their total holdings since the year’s beginning. The BTC exchange reserves have dipped by 23% to about 2.47 million BTC from 3.05 million BTC as of January 1, 2025. Related Reading: Bitcoin Climbs Past $115,000 on Inflation Relief and ETF Flows, But Bearish Signals Loom Ethereum exchange reserves, on the other hand, did not immediately start to decline until the month of May. As mentioned in the earlier post, ETH supply on exchanges began to fall following a reversal triggered by its fall to below $1,500. Over the last four months, Ethereum reserves have fallen to 17.1 million from 20.6 million, representing a 20% decline. A significant decline in exchange reserves is often interpreted as a sign of accumulation among investors. This trend could be a bullish catalyst for the two largest cryptocurrencies, especially Ethereum, considering that the coin movement started more recently.

The post included a three-day chart of the digital asset, where shaded regions were used to highlight prior cycles of price movement. According to Steph, “We just entered the ‘easy’ phase for all #XRP holders.” The chart illustrates a series of repeating intervals where XRP experienced strong upward movements following periods of consolidation. These highlighted phases appear to occur consistently across the timeline, with several cycles already observed from mid-2023 through 2025.

Each marked cycle shows XRP entering a period of relative stability before advancing sharply. This pattern has repeated multiple times, creating a visual suggestion that XRP’s current position mirrors the start of earlier rallies. The most recent XRP rally was in July when it reached an all-time high of $3.65 . Steph’s analysis suggests that XRP may again be at the beginning of a similar upward trend, reinforcing the suggestion of cyclic behavior in the asset’s performance. In addition to price action, the chart included a Stochastic RSI indicator at the bottom. The indicator shows oscillations between overbought and oversold levels, which appear to align with XRP’s cyclical surges. At the time of the post, the Stochastic RSI stood at 37.82, suggesting the token was oversold , potentially indicating room for further upward momentum if previous patterns hold. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 What it Could Mean for XRP The technical structure suggests that XRP is entering a stage where sustained upward movement becomes more probable, assuming the recurring trend continues. Previous cycles highlighted on the chart show notable and swift rises, and the asset’s recent rebound from $2.71 to over $3 supports the idea that the bull run is here. If this pattern repeats, XRP may be poised for another expansion phase, potentially challenging prior resistance levels. The chart scale lists values up to $6, which may hint at a target area the analyst considers relevant based on historical performance. With XRP trading around the $3 mark on the chart, the focus now shifts to whether the token can maintain momentum through this identified “easy” phase.

The second-largest cryptocurrency has gained over 13% in two weeks and is now within striking distance of the $5,000 psychological level. At the time of writing, ETH is trading at $4,639 with a market capitalization of $559.9 billion and a daily trading volume of $27.9 billion. Supply Squeeze Fuels ETH Optimism One of the most significant bullish factors for Ethereum is its supply squeeze. Exchange reserves have dropped to 18.8 million ETH, the lowest level since 2016, and staking activity has surged, with over 36 million ETH (approximately 30% of the supply) now staked. ETH is leaving EXCHANGES at the fastest pace ever! Reserves just plunged to 17.2M ETH! ~25M in 2023 Down 30%+ in The sell-side inventory is evaporating. pic.twitter.com/TbJkRACHB9 — Leon Waidmann (@LeonWaidmann) September 10, 2025 This reduces circulating supply, tightens liquidity, and puts upward pressure on price. Analysts also note that whale wallets and institutions have been quietly accumulating ETH, adding to the confidence in Ethereum’s long-term. Key takeaways from the supply side: Exchange reserves: 18.8M ETH, lowest since 2016 Over 36M ETH staked, ~30% of total supply Whale accumulation supports institutional confidence Ethereum (ETH/USD) Technical Outlook: Bulls Target $5K From a technical perspective , the Ethereum price prediction is slightly bullish as ETH is in an ascending channel, with price action making higher lows and testing the channel’s upper boundary. The breakout above $4,450 was confirmed by long green candles, a bullish engulfing pattern. ETH Price Chart – Source: Tradingview Momentum indicators are adding nuance. RSI has cooled from 69 to 60, so there’s room for consolidation without weakness. A spinning top or Doji candle could form here, indicating market indecision before the next move. Ethereum holds $4,640 after a 13% surge in 2 weeks. Price is pressing against the channel top, with support at $4,425 & resistance at $4,760. A break above could target $4,945. RSI cooling signals consolidation before the next leg. #ETH #Ethereum pic.twitter.com/VKDvJpvFoH — Arslan Ali (@forex_arslan) September 14, 2025 Support levels: $4,550 and $4,425 (50-SMA) Resistance levels: $4,760, $4,945 and $5,135 Long-term floor: 200-SMA at $3,994 A daily close above $4,760 would likely lead to $4,945 and then $5,135, the level where previous rallies stalled. Sentiment remains positive, supported by both fundamentals and technicals. Market Sentiment and Price Projection Ethereum’s On-Balance Volume (OBV) recently flashed an accumulation signal before the recent move. Volume is up 12.26% in 24 hours to $43.4 billion, confirming the momentum. For traders, a long entry above $4,600 with stops under $4,425 is a good setup. Targets are initially $4,760, then $4,945, and then $5,135. For newcomers, the summary is straightforward: ETH is in a bullish channel, and as long as it holds above the moving averages, the odds are in favor of a move to $5,000 and beyond. With institutional accumulation, shrinking exchange reserves and strong technicals all lining up, Ethereum may be about to make a big move.

Investors seeking early opportunities face a highly competitive landscape where success hinges on precise timing, strong community support, and innovative tokenomics. Recent trends show that meme coins are evolving beyond novelty assets. They are now fusing viral culture with advanced financial structures to attract global attention and investor interest. Today, there are a variety of promising tokens to choose from. Coins like Turbo ($TURBO), Memecoin ($MEME), Ponke ($PONKE), Baby Doge Coin ($BABYDOGE), Fartcoin ($FARTCOIN), Pudgy Penguins ($PENGU), Just a Chill Guy ($CHILLGUY), SPX6900 ($SPX), and Official Trump ($TRUMP) are all gaining momentum as investor demand surges. At the same time, the MoonBull Whitelist is live, offering early participants exclusive benefits, such as the lowest entry price, bonus token allocations, and confidential roadmap insights.

The Dogecoin price has climbed to $0.297 after breaking through key resistance, while PEPE surprised traders with a 17% rally in just 24 hours. As these meme coins roar back, attention is quickly shifting to PayFi project Remittix (RTX) , which some believe could deliver explosive 2,000% gains before the end of the bull run. Dogecoin Price Pushes Past $0.28 Resistance The Dogecoin price has surged past the $0.28 resistance level, climbing toward the psychological $0.30 mark. Analysts point out that this breakout was supported by heavy buying pressure, with RSI levels still in a good area and capital inflows suggesting whales are accumulating. If DOGE is above $0.28, key upside targets are $0.47 and $0.75. Technicals are still in higher highs and higher lows, a sign of continued bullish control. Moreover, rumours of a Dogecoin ETF have contributed to market hype, drawing more traders into DOGE. As momentum increases, the Dogecoin price could have further upside if demand remains strong and whale accumulation continues. PEPE Skyrockets With 17% Gains PEPE has become one of the weekend’s top gainers, with the price jumping 17% in a single day to $0.00001238. Trading volume exploded by 187%, signaling strong retail participation. Analysts highlight a symmetrical triangle setup on PEPE’s chart, which often leads to breakouts. If PEPE breaks resistance, it could push toward $0.000026, more than double its current price. With meme coins leading this week’s rally, traders are watching closely to see if PEPE can extend its gains or retrace back to support around $0.000011. Remittix Poised For The Next Big Move While Dogecoin and PEPE are attracting hype, many investors are turning their attention to Remittix (RTX) . Unlike meme tokens, Remittix is a PayFi altcoin designed for real-world payments, and it has already set records. The project has raised over $25.5 million, sold more than 661 million tokens, and trades at $0.1080. What makes Remittix stand out is its progress with major exchange listings. After securing a BitMart listing at $20 million raised and announcing LBANK after $22 million, the team is preparing for a third CEX launch. Add to this the upcoming wallet beta on September 15 and a $250,000 giveaway, and the excitement around RTX is easy to understand. Why Remittix Could Explode Next: Global Transfers: Users can send crypto to real bank accounts in 30+ countries. CertiK Audit: The project is fully audited, building trust with investors. Real Utility: Unlike meme coins, RTX is built for cross-border payments and adoption. Daily Rewards: There is a 15% USDT referral program that pays holders every 24 hours through the dashboard. Strong Momentum: Early whales are loading up ahead of the beta wallet launch. With its blend of utility, listings, and community-driven rewards, analysts believe Remittix could be the best-positioned altcoin for a 2,000% rally as hype continues into 2025. Final Thoughts The Dogecoin price is making waves as it reclaims the $0.30 level, and PEPE’s sharp 17% surge has shown that meme coins still have fuel left. Remittix is emerging as the project with the most potential to outshine them both. With record-breaking fundraising, confirmed listings, and a daily 15% referral program, Remittix is already being called the “XRP 2.0” of PayFi.

The MPs in question are Subang MP Wong Chen, Pandan MP Rafizi Ramli, and Sungai Petani MP Mohammed Taufiq Johari. According to reports, the Malaysian MPs were victims of cyber blackmail involving doctored AI-generated pornographic images, a move that has been described by Wong as lazy and unprofessional. In the statement released by Wong, the blackmail came to light on September 12 after his officer opened an email sent to the parliamentary office’s general complaint website. The email contained threats, a screenshot showing Wong in a compromising position, and a QR code demanding $100,000 in digital assets. Malaysian PMs blackmail with AI-generated images Wong mentioned that after the message was discovered , they took careful steps not to interact with the email. “My officer did not click on any links or scan the QR code. We immediately reported the matter to the Subang police, who promptly assigned an inspector to investigate,” he said. According to Wong, he later discovered that Rafizi had also received an identical email on the same day. The Malaysian MP claimed that the emails were the same, with the same words and a photo showing Rafizi in a compromising position. “Other than our faces, both photos are exactly identical, from the fold of the pillows and blanket, to the room, the bed, and the naked person in the photo,” he said. He also rubbished claims on the internet that his phone had been hacked, urging the public to stop sharing rumors. Wong also said that he has left the issue to the police as they are expected to provide timely updates as investigations proceed. The Malaysian MP also said he has sought assistance from IT and cryptocurrency experts to help him trace the blackmailer. He added that he may also raise the matter with Bank Negara Malaysia (BNM) and the Securities Commission to track the account. MPs promise to reveal the identity of the perpetrators The Malaysian MP, who is serving his third term, said this is not the first time that unscrupulous elements have made such attempts against him. He noted that if the perpetrators are not caught and things like this are allowed to continue, it may become a part of a broader effort to intimidate lawmakers. In addition, Wong also said he will not allow the incident to dissuade him from carrying out the job he was elected to do. “I echo Rafizi’s concerns that these attacks may be more sinister, possibly aimed at accessing our devices or undermining parliamentary democracy,” he said. “I will not retreat and will continue to discharge my duties without fear or favour.” Meanwhile, Rafizi, who has served as an economy minister in Malaysia, also confirmed yesterday that he had received the same blackmail message. He said he has faced four hack attempts in the last nine months. In another separate statement today, Taufiq mentioned that he had been targeted by the scammers who are circulating AI-generated pornographic content of someone who shares a likeness with him in exchange for money in digital assets. He noted that he has since involved the police, filed a police report, and urged them to work on it swiftly. He also encouraged the public to remain vigilant and not give in to threats and blackmail.

Key Takeaways: Coinbase is expanding beyond trading into custody, derivatives, and stablecoins as competition intensifies. Despite strong ETF custody revenues and new ventures, Coinbase remains heavily exposed to Bitcoin price swings. Trading fees, still the core of Coinbase’s revenue, rise and fall with crypto market volatility. With Bitcoin hitting record highs and US regulation creating fresh momentum for institutional adoption, the company faces growing pressure from both traditional finance and emerging crypto players, according to a new report from the Financial Times . Coinbase’s UK Crypto Ad Rejected Amid Push to Broaden Services In July, Coinbase launched a high-budget TV ad in the UK that framed cryptocurrency as a solution to a failing financial system. The ad was rejected for not meeting broadcast standards due to a lack of risk warnings. The campaign came as the exchange seeks to expand beyond trading into custody, payments, asset management, and derivatives. Founded in 2012, Coinbase entered the S&P 500 this year and now boasts a market cap of $83 billion. Its shares have surged 70% since Donald Trump’s election, thanks in part to his administration’s crypto-friendly stance. However, second-quarter earnings disappointed , and the stock dropped 15%, signaling investor caution. A growing concern is the company’s exposure to the price of Bitcoin. Trading fees, still the core of Coinbase’s revenue, rise and fall with crypto market volatility. Coinbase have released a brilliant advert that rips the piss out of the current dire state of the UK. Let's be honest, it's funny and feels pretty accurate. This is what this disastrous Labour has reduced us to. We're now a global laughing stock. pic.twitter.com/V9DbDYJoOY — Lee Harris (@addicted2newz) August 2, 2025 Fee compression and competition from Asian exchanges are also eating into its margins. Coinbase has secured its position as custodian for eight of the top 11 US Bitcoin ETFs, earning $43 million in the last quarter of 2024 from that alone. However, new legislation could open the door for traditional custodians like State Street and BNY Mellon to enter the market , threatening Coinbase’s dominance. The firm is also eyeing tokenized stock trading and small business banking services, while leaning heavily into stablecoins and staking. Revenues from its USDC stablecoin partnership with Circle now trail only trading, while staking offers high-margin returns and defensibility. In its boldest move yet, Coinbase acquired crypto derivatives platform Deribit for $2.9 billion , signaling its intention to dominate that space. The company has also partnered with banks like JPMorgan and PNC to bridge crypto and traditional finance. Despite its expansion, analysts say Coinbase’s fortunes remain tightly tethered to Bitcoin’s price. TIME Names Coinbase a 2025 ‘Disruptor’ Among Most Influential Companies As reported, TIME has recognized Coinbase as one of 2025’s 100 Most Influential Companies , labeling the crypto exchange a “disruptor” for its significant role in shaping US digital asset policies and markets. TIME noted the exchange as a key driver behind the industry’s policy efforts and predicted Coinbase could become the central hub for crypto trading in the US. Beyond the US, Coinbase is broadening its reach in Europe, securing a license under the EU’s MiCA regulatory framework through Luxembourg’s financial regulator. Notably, Coinbase also continued its corporate Bitcoin accumulation. In Q2, the company purchased 2,509 BTC for approximately $222 million, lifting its total holdings to 11,776 BTC and placing it back among the top 10 public holders of the asset, just ahead of Tesla by coin count.

The foundation's privacy-focused team will now operate as Privacy Stewards of Ethereum (PSE). The published roadmap was compiled by team member Sam Richards. Richards said, “Ethereum is on its way to becoming the world's consensus layer. But without strong privacy, it risks becoming the backbone of global surveillance, not global freedom. If Ethereum doesn't build privacy, it can't protect the people who rely on it.” The new roadmap focuses on three main topics: Private writes: Making private on-chain transactions as cheap and seamless as public transactions. Private reads: Providing the ability to read data from the blockchain without revealing identity or intent. Private proving: Making evidence generation and verification fast, private, and accessible. The PSE team is working on an experimental Layer-2 design called PlasmaFold, part of a custom script. This design aims to add confidential transfer capabilities. The first prototype of the feature is scheduled to be unveiled at Devconnect, the ETH developer conference that begins in Argentina on November 17. The team also aims to publish the “Private Voting 2025” report and work on confidential DeFi solutions that will enhance privacy while maintaining corporate compliance standards. Related News: Experienced Expert Reveals: “The Market is Underestimating It, But a Major Bitcoin Announcement from the US Could Be Coming” Privacy-focused RPC services are being developed for private reading. PSE, noting that standard RPC calls can leak personal data such as IP addresses or user account details, has formed a working group to address this issue. The “prove anywhere” initiative stands out in the context of private proofs. Its goal is to make zero-knowledge proofs (ZK proofs) easier and more cost-effective to produce on everyday devices. *This is not investment advice.

Officials in the UK are touting BofA’s expansion and similar moves by other US financial firms as evidence of growing American interest in Britain’s financial services ahead of President Trump’s trip next week. Reeves says BofA’s expansion will create more jobs and promote economic growth According to the UK Department for Business and Trade, Bank of America’s new facility would establish Belfast as a leading hub , reinforcing its reputation as a fintech innovation and security operations center. It further noted that the project would be a “major milestone that underscores the region’s growing role in global financial services.” Officials said the jobs will focus on technology, operations, and financial services, significantly boosting Northern Ireland’s skilled workforce. The bank confirmed to BBC News NI on Saturday that the Belfast office would be built up in phases, adding that recruitment will begin shortly and the final location will be announced soon. Bank of America CEO Brian Moynihan said the company is glad to expand its UK footprint with a new Belfast operations center to serve its global operations. He wrote in a statement, “The early US-UK trade agreement that the president and the prime minister began discussing in February has provided the business community with the certainty and framework it needs to strengthen transatlantic commerce.” According to a DBT spokesperson, the Belfast site will feature advanced AML systems and cybersecurity functions and is expected to generate high-value jobs within Northern Ireland’s fintech industry. The Deputy First Minister Emma Little-Pengelly described the investment as a powerful signal of trust in Northern Ireland, noting that it reinforces the region’s expanding reputation for world-class professional services. Additionally, Chancellor Rachel Reeves stated that the investments will create jobs across the country, from Belfast to Edinburgh, and help drive the growth needed to raise household incomes. The Business and Trade Secretary Peter Kyle said the news reaffirms the UK’s place as a leading investment hub . He noted that the financial services sector drives a dynamic economy. He commented, “Strengthening ties with the US boosts our economy, creates jobs, and secures our role in global finance. These investments reflect the strength of our enduring ‘golden corridor’ with one of our closest trading partners.” Citigroup is planning on investing more in its UK operations The UK Department for Business and Trade also confirmed Citigroup will inject £1.1 billion into its UK business. In comparison, S&P Global pledged over £4 million for its Manchester offices. Part of Citi’s UK investment will go toward expanding its presence in Northern Ireland, with CEO Jane Fraser stressing that the UK remains a cornerstone of Citi’s global operations. Fraser noted that Citi’s relationship with the UK is long-established, with nearly 14,000 employees across London, Belfast, Edinburgh, and Jersey — including many of its senior leaders. As Cryptopolitan reported last month, UK business activity rose at its quickest pace in a year in August, while government borrowing was less than economists had expected for the month before; these offered a mild lift to public finances even as growth eases and hiring remains subdued. The S&P Global UK Composite Purchasing Managers’ Index increased to 53 in August from 51.5 in July. Readings over 50 indicate expansion; August was the fourth consecutive month that found the index in that territory. The gain was led by stronger demand in business services, where firms indicated a clear increase in new work. The country’s manufacturers also reported improved sentiment, but services led the way and pulled up the overall index relative to a month earlier. Don’t just read crypto news. Understand it.

With strong upward momentum taking it past the $202 resistance level, traders are eyeing further gains if SOL can hold support between $193 and $196. While Solana’s rise is catching headlines, savvy investors are betting on a different token with even greater potential: Little Pepe (LILPEPE) . This meme-powered Layer-2 blockchain, priced at just $0.0021 in its presale, is positioned for a possible 10,000% surge that could turn $4,500 into $450,000. Solana Gains Ground Toward $250 The bullish case for Solana continues to strengthen. If Solana (SOL) climbs past the $218 resistance level, experts believe the crypto could quickly head toward the $250 mark. Positive sentiment among traders is backed by on-chain data, which reports a 48% spike in daily transaction volume, along with a 54% rise in Total Value Locked (TVL) that now stands at $7.24 million. Solana Price Chart | TradingView Both indicators point to a growing user base and a fresh wave of interest in Solana’s ecosystem. However, while Solana’s potential upside from here may deliver a 20–25% return, many traders are turning their attention to new opportunities that promise far higher multiples. This is where Little Pepe (LILPEPE) enters the conversation as a meme-powered blockchain primed for exponential growth. Little Pepe (LILPEPE): The Crypto Backed By Smart Investors Little Pepe (LILPEPE) is not a typical meme token. It combines the humor-driven appeal of meme culture with real blockchain utility. Built as a Layer-2 blockchain, Little Pepe (LILPEPE) offers swift transactions with extremely low fees, creating a unique ecosystem where meme magic meets performance. The project’s slogan captures its ethos perfectly: LILPEPE doesn’t just scale Ethereum, it out-memes it. This balance of strong fundamentals with cultural relevance is why it is capturing so much investor attention during its presale. The presale of Little Pepe (LILPEPE) has become one of the hottest in the market. Stage 11 sold out faster than anticipated, helping the project raise over $22.3 million. It is now in stage 12, priced at $0.0021, marking a 110% increase from its starting presale price. So far, over 15.43 billion tokens have been sold, demonstrating strong demand from early adopters. Adding to its credibility, CoinMarketCap has officially listed LILPEPE, which increases visibility and trust among investors. With its presale stages progressing quickly, those who buy now are positioning themselves before potential major price lifts post-launch. The Path to Potential 100x Returns What makes Little Pepe (LILPEPE) especially attractive is its growth potential. While the Solana price may continue its climb to $250, its current price level limits the scale of possible returns in the near term. In contrast, LILPEPE’s presale valuation leaves room for exponential upside. Analysts suggest the token could achieve a 100x rally, meaning a $4,500 investment could expand into $450,000 if its growth projections materialize. Early movers who secure tokens at $0.0021 could be part of the next big meme coin success story. Part of what fuels the hype around Little Pepe is its engaging approach to community rewards. Over 62,000 entries have already been recorded for its mega giveaway spanning stages 12 to 17 of the presale. The rewards are substantial, with the biggest buyer winning 5 ETH, the second 3 ETH, the third 2 ETH, and an additional 15 random buyers each receiving 0.5 ETH. On top of this, all token holders are eligible for the broader $777,000 giveaway. The Little Pepe team has laid out a roadmap filled with ambitious milestones, from exchange listings to ecosystem integrations and community-driven campaigns. With investor attention already locked in, the roadmap suggests that LILPEPE is building for longevity and not just a short-term pump.

As it breaks the $202 resistance, market experts are eyeing a significant leap towards the $250 mark, fueled by strong trading momentum and robust on-chain activity. Examining Solana's Price Trajectory and Market Sentiments With Solana's price approaching critical resistance levels around $218, predictions are rife about it reaching the $250 threshold. Market optimism is supported by a notable 48% increase in daily transactions and a 54% growth in the Total Value Locked (TVL), now at $7.24 million. Solana Price Chart | TradingView Increasing user engagement and heightened interest in Solana's ecosystem suggest potential for a 20-25% return. However, savvy investors are exploring other emerging opportunities, like the meme-powered blockchain Little Pepe (LILPEPE), which promises significantly higher returns. Little Pepe: A New Contender in the Crypto Arena Unlike typical meme coins, Little Pepe (LILPEPE) offers a blend of humor and serious blockchain functionality. Operating as a Layer-2 solution, it ensures fast transactions at minimal fees, appealing to both meme enthusiasts and performance seekers.

This alarming incident has raised concerns about SHIB’s stability and possible price drop. Could risks within the Shibarium network push SHIB to the edge? Discover which cryptocurrencies are poised for potential growth amid this unsettling event. Shiba Inu Price Sees Uptrend with Room for Further Growth Source: tradingview Shiba Inu (SHIB) is currently priced between $0.00001199 and $0.00001278. Lately, it has experienced around an 18% jump in just one week. The crypto shows promise, approaching its resistance at $0.00001308. Should it break this, the next target is $0.00001387. In the last month, Shiba Inu has grown by about 5%, indicating slow but steady progress. Over six months, it has climbed over 11%. The strong RSI reading of 74.75 suggests bullish momentum, signaling potential for more growth. Shiba Inu could continue rising if it maintains its current pace. Conclusion The recent hack poses significant challenges for SHIB's stability and community confidence. As the network grapples with security issues, investors might reconsider their positions. A decline toward $0.00001 could be possible if solutions to these vulnerabilities aren’t quickly addressed.

The People’s Bank of China set the yuan’s daily reference rate at its firmest since November 2024, abandoning months of effort to prop it up beyond market levels. This development, according to data from Bloomberg, is being felt far outside China’s borders as traders across the globe reposition around the yuan’s climb . The yuan is up more than 2% this year against the U.S. dollar, snapping a three-year losing streak. Hedge funds have started piling into bullish yuan options, with bets placed on the currency heading below 7 per dollar before the end of the year. It was around 7.12 last Friday. EM currency index reacts to the yuan move Eric Fine, a portfolio manager at VanEck Associates in New York, said the direction of the yuan plays a dominant role in the value of emerging-market currencies . “China’s yuan is the key currency cross for most EMs; they trade more with China than they do with the US,” Eric said. “The winners are all EMs.” The MSCI Emerging Markets Currency Index, which tracks a basket of EM currencies, had dropped 0.3% this quarter. It had posted gains in the previous two quarters as traders responded to shifting Federal Reserve policies. For 2025, the index is still up about 6.8%. The movement of the yuan is directly tied to the performance of this index, with a 30-day correlation of 0.59 recorded at the end of August, the highest since May 2024. Data reviewed over the past twelve months shows that when the yuan moves 1%, the Thai baht, Malaysian ringgit, Chilean peso, Mexican peso, and Brazilian real tend to move right along with it. That tight relationship is now back in focus as Beijing gives the yuan more breathing space. This is a reversal from the beginning of the year when the PBOC was actively holding the line, managing the yuan through persistent dollar pressure and fears around U.S. tariffs. Eric noted that there had been “market speculation” earlier in the year about China devaluing its currency in response to economic pressure from President Trump’s trade stance. That didn’t happen. Instead, VanEck has increased its position in local-currency EM bonds, reducing its exposure to dollar-denominated notes. China links yuan strength to broader global strategy Brad Bechtel, global head of FX at Jefferies, said the strengthening of the yuan could be tied to ongoing trade talks between Washington and Beijing, and may also reflect “international pressure to let the renminbi strengthen.” Brad said that letting the yuan appreciate gives room for other Asian currencies to move up as well, which in turn gives their central banks more flexibility on monetary policy. Brad also added that the impact won’t stop in Asia. The appreciation will likely “spill over to the broader EM space,” with other emerging-market economies feeling the ripple effect, especially those whose economies depend on Chinese demand for goods, services, or raw materials. Christopher Hamilton, head of client investment solutions for Asia Pacific ex-Japan at Invesco, described the bigger regional impact: “When CNY strengthens, EM Asia FX and local debts get permission to breathe.” Christopher said that a stronger yuan supports the de-dollarization trend gaining ground in Asia. China has been pushing hard to boost the yuan’s global role. As skepticism grows around U.S. economic leadership, Beijing sees an opening. The country is now running aggressive campaigns to increase yuan use in international settlements, and a strong yuan makes it easier to sell that narrative to trade partners who are tiring of dollar dependence. Last year, China was the second-largest trading partner of developing economies in Asia, making up 9% of their total trade, based on IMF data. The yuan acts as an anchor for those markets. And with Beijing now letting it climb, traders are watching closely for what this means for crypto markets, commodities, and EMFX bonds. The yuan still trades in a 2% daily band from the central reference point set by the PBOC. But that band doesn’t limit impact. Since July, the PBOC had been nudging the currency higher than traders expected. Don’t just read crypto news. Understand it. Subscribe to our newsletter.

Analysts at the crypto research firm CryptoQuant noted in their weekly report that Ethereum has come a long way since spot exchange-traded funds (ETFs) were approved. Like bitcoin (BTC), ether (ETH) is now increasingly being viewed as a long-term strategic asset. This has led to higher demand from market participants. Rising Institutional Adoption According to CryptoQuant, demand from institutional investors and large holders drove ether’s recent rally from $1,400 in April 2025 to nearly $5,000 in late August. Ethereum holdings by U.S. spot ETFs have risen to an all-time high (ATH) of 6.7 million ETH. The assets have almost doubled since the price of ETH began to surge. Likewise, addresses holding between 10,000 and 100,000 ETH have scooped up roughly six million tokens within the same time period. The consistent accumulation has taken their holdings to new highs of 20.6 million ETH. “This level of institutional endorsement provides a robust long-term tailwind for Ethereum’s price and perceived legitimacy,” analysts explained. Besides rising demand, selling pressure on ETH has eased up. The amount of ETH flowing into centralized exchanges has declined , particularly since the asset reached its peak near $5,000. Daily inflows have fallen from 1.8 million in mid-August to 750,000 ETH currently. This indicates that investors prefer to hold for further upside rather than cash in current gains – a trend that supports price stability. Additionally, the amount of ETH staked has surged since May, hitting a record 36.2 million. This rise in validator deposits indicates growing long-term confidence in the network, reduces liquid supply, and adds bullish pressure. Ethereum Network is Booming With the Ethereum network booming, total transaction counts and active addresses have reached record highs of 1.7 million and 800,000, respectively, in August. Smart contract calls have also reached new levels, surpassing previous cycles with 12 million daily interactions. CryptoQuant analysts say such activity growth highlights Ethereum’s growing role as a programmable settlement layer supported by decentralized finance (DeFi) and asset tokenization . Meanwhile, ETH currently faces resistance at $5,200, a realized price upper band that has remained a critical level in past cycles. A decisive breakout above this level would mark the onset of a strong bullish phase, while sustained consolidation below it could signal a cooling period.

This achievement raises questions about the future of its native token, LINK. With explosive growth on the horizon, the token's potential to surpass $30 piques interest. Readers will discover which other coins show promise for growth in this dynamic market. Chainlink (LINK) Shows Potential for Breakout with Recent Price Movements Source: tradingview Chainlink's price is currently hovering between roughly $22 and $24. It recently gained almost 13% in a week, while a 6-month view shows a rise of just under 88%. The key sign is the price approaching its resistance level at nearly $25. If it breaks this barrier, it could target the next level at about $27. However, it holds steady above a support level of nearly $21. This means there is a lively push towards higher prices. Chainlink's strong streak suggests it could continue rising, potentially gaining another 10% to 15% if momentum holds. Conclusion Chainlink's achievement of securing $100 billion in total value highlights its strong position in the market. This milestone could drive significant interest and support for LINK. If the momentum continues, it's feasible that LINK could rally beyond $30. The platform's established role and ongoing growth suggest a positive outlook for its value trajectory.

The outlook, shared by analyst Diana in an X post on September 12, builds on a projection from Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse, who suggested that XRP could capture 14% of SWIFT’s $1.5 quadrillion annual flows within the next five years. According to the analyst, if XRP managed to secure that 14% share, roughly $210 trillion, nearly eight times the size of the U.S. economy, even a fraction passing through its liquidity pools could propel the token into uncharted territory, far beyond previous highs. Diana also noted that XRP’s potential extends beyond SWIFT, as the token is already linked to key global financial infrastructure. This includes the DTCC, which handles $3 quadrillion in settlements, U.S. and Japanese banks holding $37.5 trillion in deposits, and payment giants like Visa, Mastercard, and American Express, which process $26 trillion annually. 4️⃣ THE NUMBERS GET WILD 🔢 Conservative math: • 1% of $530T global flows = ~$96/XRP Speculative liquidity squeeze: • 5.6B effective float = $943/XRP ⚡️ Yes, that’s three digits. And it’s not hopium — it’s math. — Diana (@InvestWithD) September 12, 2025 Ripple’s technology is also positioned to play a central role in the rapidly growing tokenization market, expected to reach trillions in value over the coming decade. Using conservative assumptions, the analyst pointed out that if XRP captured just 1% of the $530 trillion in global payment flows, its price could climb to around $96. Under a more speculative liquidity squeeze scenario, where XRP’s effective float is about 5.6 billion tokens, the valuation could surge to $943 per coin. XRP price analysis If XRP were to hit $943, it would mark a rally of over 30,000%, giving the token a market cap of roughly $56.2 trillion, making it the world’s top-ranked asset, assuming Bitcoin and gold record minimal growth during the same period. At press time, XRP was trading at $3.05, down 3.6% in the past 24 hours. On the weekly chart, however, the asset has gained more than 7%. XRP seven-day price chart.

On Sunday, Tehran’s Supreme National Security Council warned that the entire agreement with the International Atomic Energy Agency could be scrapped if France, Germany, or the UK go ahead with reinstating old Security Council measures. According to the statement, “those arrangements will be suspended” if there’s “any hostile action,” including reviving resolutions that were previously closed. The Council, which sets both security and foreign policy for the country, made it clear that Iran has already agreed to submit reports to the IAEA. But if that deal is under threat, so is Iran’s willingness to keep playing along. Tehran also repeated that it might pull out of the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons if the pressure keeps coming . According to Bloomberg, this back-and-forth follows the strikes in June by U.S. and Israeli forces on three Iranian nuclear facilities. After those bombings, Iran blocked all foreign access to its nuclear sites, arguing that giving up information could help future attacks. With inspections frozen, the UK, France, and Germany moved to activate a formal process that could bring back UN sanctions. The deadline they gave is September 28. Europe sets deadline, Iran delays cooperation Iran and the IAEA tried to fix the damage last week with a face-to-face meeting in Cairo. IAEA Director General Rafael Mariano Grossi and Iranian diplomat Abbas Araghchi came out of that meeting with a tentative deal. That deal could open the door for inspections to restart, but Europe isn’t convinced. All three countries said Iran must first reveal exactly where its uranium is and engage in talks with President Trump’s administration before the UN penalties can be taken off the table. Speaking in Vienna on Wednesday, Rafael said the document agreed upon in Cairo “provides for a clear understanding of the procedures for inspection, notifications, and their implementation.” He added that it includes “reporting on all the attacked facilities, including the nuclear material present.” The meeting in Egypt came as international players are trying to bring Iran back under proper oversight. The June airstrikes didn’t just hit infrastructure. They also ended two decades of IAEA monitoring. Since then, no one knows how much enriched uranium Iran has or where it is. Diplomats say Iran still hasn’t turned over the initial report detailing uranium locations. And until they do, the IAEA can’t safely send inspectors into sites that are now filled with unexploded bombs and toxic waste. Iran resists inspections over Israeli airstrike fears Iran now has two weeks to show it’s serious before UN sanctions hit again. If that happens, Iran has threatened to walk away completely, shutting down the inspection deal and possibly leaving the NPT altogether. The IAEA hasn’t published the full agreement with Tehran, and officials are being careful. At Wednesday’s board meeting, diplomats said the agency might acknowledge the progress but won’t slow the sanctions process. Everything depends on whether Iran delivers that report before the September 28 deadline. The Cairo meeting happened as Israeli warplanes carried out airstrikes in Qatar, targeting Hamas, a Palestinian group supported by Iran. That timing fed Iran’s argument that any data it shares with the IAEA could get passed to Israeli forces, putting nuclear sites and personnel in danger. Rafael addressed that worry directly. “The issue of confidentiality has been mentioned a lot,” he said during a Monday press briefing. “We are ready to talk about their security concerns. And this is a part of what we are discussing now.” KEY Difference Wire helps crypto brands break through and dominate headlines fast",Economy|EUR|IRR|USD,EN,0,0,MACROECONOMICS|CRYPTOCURRENCY|REGULATION,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-09-14 14:01:02

Several new patterns suggest this shift is already underway. Certain tokens with funny names are capturing attention. Major changes are stirring, making some coins stand out more than others. All eyes are turning to see which projects will set the trend for the months ahead. XYZVerse Sets a New Trend, Could This be the Next 50X Meme Coin? The buzz around XYZVerse is real. As the first-ever all-sports meme token, it is going to break records in the meme coin space, targeting 50X growth upon launch. The current presale gives early investors the chance to grab $XYZ tokens at a significantly discounted price, far below the expected listing price. Bullish Mood on $XYZ XYZVerse is already featured on CoinMarketCap where the community has shown a strongly bullish mood on this coin, with 95% voters anticipating $XYZ to grow. XYZ was further noticed by reputable crypto influencers. DanjoCapitalMaster , who has close to 800,000 followers, recently expressed his support for the project, calling XYZVerse a “moonshot opportunity.” More Than Just a Meme Coin Unlike most meme coins that ride trends without much substance, XYZVerse is setting a new trend. It is blending the high-energy world of sports with the viral nature of meme culture. And it’s working. The presale is moving fast, with early buyers locking in tokens at a fraction of what some believe could be its future value. Right now, XYZVerse is still in its presale phase, but demand is high. The price has already climbed from $0.0001 in Stage 1 to $0.005 by Stage 13, with over $15 million already raised. Investors who got in early have secured a steep discount, and with a target listing price of $0.1, those numbers have people paying attention. Still Time to Get in Before the Presale Ends Beyond just hype, XYZVerse has a structured tokenomics model aimed at long-term sustainability. A share of 15% is allocated to liquidity to create a solid market foundation.To reward its community via airdrops and bonuses, the team has put aside 10% of the total supply. Moreover, a big chunk of 17.13% is designated for deflationary burns, which could reduce supply and drive demand for $XYZ over time. A Community-Driven Project With Big Plans One thing setting XYZVerse apart is how it engages its community. The team recently launched the Ambassador Program, giving users the chance to earn free tokens by supporting the project. And that’s just the start—there are already talks with major sports celebrities to help boost visibility. The recent partnership with decentralized sportsbook bookmaker.XYZ underscores XYZVerse’s commitment to expanding its utility. It’s a big move that gives the community something to actually use. As part of the deal, $XYZ holders get a special bonus on their first bet—a nice perk that adds extra value just for being part of the ecosystem. Could XYZVerse Be the Next Big Meme Coin? With a fast-growing presale, a strong community, and an ambitious roadmap, XYZVerse has the ingredients of a project with serious potential. While the crypto market is always unpredictable, many investors see this as an opportunity to get in early on something big. The presale won’t last forever—so if you’re interested, now might be the time to take a closer look. Join XYZVerse, the Next Moonshot Opportunity BONK: The Barking Token Shaking Up Solana BONK is a playful coin that runs on the speedy Solana network. Its mascot, a cheerful Shiba Inu, hints at its link to viral dog tokens like Dogecoin and Shiba Inu. But BONK brings a twist. Half of all coins went straight to fans who use Solana apps for art, games, and lending. This huge giveaway won trust and spread the word. When Coinbase added BONK, the price jumped more than 100% in a day, proving the crowd is watching. BONK rides on Solana’s low fees and quick trades, so small holders can join with ease. The team plans BonkSwap, a simple exchange where the coin will fuel deals across many mini apps. This could place BONK at the center of a busy mall of digital tools. The catch is a sky-high supply, which may slow price gains. Still, meme coins often thrive in hot markets, and BONK is one of few with real use plans. Fans seeking fresh energy beyond Bitcoin may find its bark worth a look. Dogwifhat: The Solana Pup Chasing Big Gains in Meme Coin Season Dogwifhat (WIF) is the new pup in town. The token lives on Solana and wears the famous knitted cap from the viral “dogwifhat” meme. Like Dogecoin or Shiba Inu, WIF wants to turn laughs into coins. The idea is simple: a fun theme pulls people in, the crowd spreads it online, and demand can snowball. Fans share gifs, trade stickers, and dream of moon shots. Because there are many tokens in supply, even tiny moves can shake the price hard. That wild spirit is part of the charm. Built on Solana, WIF enjoys fast speeds and tiny fees, giving it an edge over older dog coins that still wait in long queues. Right now, the market buzz favors fresh memes and cheap chains, and WIF ticks both boxes. It often trends beside BONK and other Solana stars. If the current “meme season” holds, a strong community could push WIF higher. Yet the same hype that fuels it can cool without warning, so many holders treat it as a quick play rather than a long stay. Conclusion BONK and WIF confirm strong alt momentum, yet XYZVerse emerges as the first all-sport memecoin, merging fan passion and GameFi while aiming for a 20,000% surge via its community roadmap.

Analysts are eyeing a potential surge to $8, which would represent an impressive 875% increase. The strength of the Cardano price trajectory reflects strong ecosystem growth, but while ADA may be heading higher, another project has caught the spotlight. Little Pepe (LILPEPE) , priced at $0.0021 in its presale, is gaining momentum as the crypto many believe could deliver 75x returns. Cardano Price Driven by Ecosystem Growth The Cardano price outlook is increasingly bullish due to its expanding DeFi ecosystem. Total Value Locked (TVL) in Cardano’s DeFi sector has soared by 166% quarter-over-quarter and 693% year-over-year, showing deepening adoption. Technical charts also reinforce optimism. Additionally, whales are accumulating, with 1.41 billion ADA scooped up recently, adding further support to predictions of the Cardano price pushing toward $8. Yet, while ADA’s steady climb remains attractive, many investors are looking for projects with higher risk-reward potential. That is where Little Pepe (LILPEPE) enters the conversation. Little Pepe (LILPEPE): The Crypto That Could Deliver you 75x Gains Little Pepe is more than a meme coin. It operates as a Layer 2 blockchain, built for speed, security, and ultra-low fees, while embracing the meme culture that has driven viral growth across the crypto space. Positioned as the “next PEPE,” LILPEPE is tapping into a cultural wave and combining it with robust tokenomics and a successful presale. The project is in stage 12 of its presale, with each token priced at $0.0021. Having already raised over $24.84 million, momentum is strong. A total of 100 billion tokens have been created, with a carefully managed supply structure that makes the project appealing for both early investors and long-term holders. Little Pepe’s presale has been a success story in itself. With stage 11 already completed and stage 12 underway, demand is growing. At the current price of $0.0021, analysts suggest a potential 75x increase, taking the token to $0.1575 if demand continues at this pace. Comparisons with early-stage meme tokens that later went on to dominate the market highlight why many investors believe LILPEPE could be the next big thing. The project also benefits from timing, arriving as meme coins are seeing a resurgence across the crypto market. For investors watching the Cardano price aiming for $8, LILPEPE represents a different type of opportunity. ADA offers stability with growth potential, while LILPEPE provides exponential upside to those willing to enter early. Tokenomics Built for Growth The tokenomics of Little Pepe (LILPEPE) have been designed with growth and sustainability in mind. Here’s the breakdown: 26.5% allocated to presale 10% dedicated to liquidity 30% reserved for chain reserves 10% for DEX allocation 10% for marketing 13.5% for staking and rewards 0% tax This balanced approach ensures liquidity, marketing support, and rewards for holders, while maintaining project transparency. A CertiK audit with a high security score of 95.49% has further strengthened community trust. Community Rewards and Listings Little Pepe (LILPEPE) has also launched major incentives for its growing community. A $770,000 giveaway is currently underway, with 10 winners each set to receive $77,000. Additionally, the top three buyers between presale stages 12–17 will be rewarded with 5 ETH, 3 ETH, and 2 ETH, respectively. To widen participation, 15 random buyers will each receive 0.5 ETH. On top of that, LILPEPE has already been listed on CoinMarketCap. The team has confirmed plans to list on two top centralized exchanges at launch, with the biggest global exchange also in the roadmap. This positions the token for strong liquidity and visibility immediately after launch. Final Thoughts The crypto market thrives on diversity. The Cardano price rally highlights the strength of established platforms, with ADA well-positioned to push toward $8 as its DeFi ecosystem continues to expand. At the same time, Little Pepe represents the high-growth potential side of the market. With a presale price of $0.0021, community-focused rewards, a CertiK audit, and exchange listings on the horizon, LILPEPE could be the project that delivers 75x gains for bold investors.

Among the notable contenders, Cardano (ADA) has experienced a notable increase in value, currently trading at about $0.82, and is predicted to rise dramatically. Simultaneously, Little Pepe (LILPEPE) emerges as a high-growth prospect with its ongoing presale sparking considerable interest. A Closer Look at Cardano's Growth Cardano's ecosystem has shown substantial growth, driving its market price up by 39.64% over the past month. This uptick is not just a short-term spike but a reflection of sustained developmental milestones and increased adoption in its decentralized finance (DeFi) sector. With analysts setting a future price target at $8—a potential increase of 875%—Cardano is a hot topic among investors. Technical analyses and whale activities further support this optimistic forecast. Recently, significant acquisitions totalling 1.41 billion ADA were recorded, indicating strong confidence among large scale investors. Introducing Little Pepe: A Potential Giant in the Making An intriguing addition to the crypto space, Little Pepe (LILPEPE), currently priced at just $0.0021 per token, is drawing attention with promises of delivering up to 75x returns. This project is not just another meme coin; it is a Layer 2 blockchain solution emphasizing speed, security, and minimal transaction fees, all while capitalizing on the popular meme culture. Now in the 12th stage of its presale and having raised over $24.84 million, the momentum behind Little Pepe is palpable. Positioned as the next big meme token, it invites both crypto enthusiasts and investors looking for the next viral success. Why Little Pepe Stands Out The tokenomics of Little Pepe are carefully crafted to support sustainable growth and community engagement, with 26.5% of tokens allocated to the presale and significant portions dedicated to liquidity and chain reserves. Moreover, the project has undergone a CertiK audit, securing a high security score which bolsters its credibility. Further sweetening the deal, Little Pepe is conducting a $770,000 giveaway for its community members, alongside substantial rewards for top buyers during its presale phases. The developers have also planned listings on prominent centralized exchanges, enhancing liquidity and visibility post-launch. The Dual Appeal of Cardano and Little Pepe The crypto market is diverse, with different cryptocurrencies serving different needs. Cardano offers long-term stability with substantial growth potential, making it a reliable investment. On the other hand, Little Pepe caters to those seeking higher risks and possibly higher returns, evidenced by its aggressive presale and community-focused incentives.

The legal action, according to Reuters, is the first of its kind brought by a major U.S. media house targeting Google’s AI-generated results that now appear above regular search links. The family-run publisher, which is led by Jay Penske and claims 120 million monthly online visitors across its properties, argues that these AI summaries are pulling traffic away from its websites. The company says Google is republishing its journalism in these overviews without a license and without any form of compensation. Penske claims this is hurting both ad and subscription revenues at a time when search traffic is already falling. Penske links AI summaries to traffic loss and falling revenue The lawsuit says that around 20% of searches that used to send users to Penske’s sites now show AI Overviews instead. This change, according to the company, has led to affiliate revenue dropping by over one-third by the end of 2024. Jay said in a statement, “We have a responsibility to proactively fight for the future of digital media and preserve its integrity – all of which is threatened by Google’s current actions.” Penske claims Google forces publishers to accept these terms if they want to be included in search results at all. Without agreeing to let their work be summarized by AI, the company says it would lose visibility. The lawsuit also brought up the infamous 2024 federal court ruling that said Google holds a near 90% share of the U.S. search market, saying it gives Google unfair power to control how digital content is accessed and distributed. In February, education platform Chegg also sued Google over the same issue. The company said AI Overviews were causing a drop in demand for original learning materials. The legal complaints echo concerns from media groups who say Google’s AI is lifting content without payment, while pretending it’s offering users more helpful search experiences. Google defends its AI; publishers say deals aren’t equal Jose Castaneda, a spokesperson for Google, responded on Saturday by saying, “With AI Overviews, people find Search more helpful and use it more, creating new opportunities for content to be discovered. We will defend against these meritless claims.” Google insists the tool is designed to improve the user experience and help surface more content from across the internet. But that defense isn’t landing well with publishers. Danielle Coffey, CEO of the News/Media Alliance, a trade group that represents over 2,200 U.S. publishers, told Reuters that Google is avoiding the kind of licensing deals that others in the AI world are now signing. She said : “All of the elements being negotiated with every other AI company doesn’t apply to Google because they have the market power to not engage in those healthy practices. When you have the massive scale and market power that Google has, you are not obligated to abide by the same norms. That is the problem.” While AI companies like OpenAI have reached licensing agreements with outlets such as News Corp, Financial Times, and The Atlantic, Google has not moved as quickly. Its AI product, Gemini, directly competes with ChatGPT, yet unlike its rival, Google hasn’t finalized similar partnerships with media companies. Earlier this month, Google scored a legal victory in a separate antitrust case, when a judge ruled it would not be forced to sell off its Chrome browser. That decision disappointed publishers and groups like Coffey’s, who say it left them with no real way to opt out of Google’s AI summaries. For now, Google continues to control nearly every part of the discovery pipeline, from crawling to ranking to summarizing, and Penske wants the courts to decide if that level of control has gone too far.

The transformation shifts focus from cryptography exploration to problem-first solutions addressing Ethereum’s surveillance vulnerabilities. PSE’s new mission centers on three core tracks: private writes to make on-chain actions as cheap and seamless as public ones, private reads enabling surveillance-free blockchain queries, and private proving for accessible data verification. The initiative follows Vitalik Buterin’s April advocacy for privacy as essential to Ethereum’s survival as a global settlement infrastructure. The roadmap warns that without robust privacy protections, Ethereum risks becoming “ the backbone of global surveillance rather than global freedom .” PSE emphasizes that institutions and users will migrate elsewhere if private transactions, identity, and data remain compromised by public blockchain transparency. Bullish privacy. Bullish Ethereum. Bullish PSE @PrivacyEthereum https://t.co/WK88A1dGge — samrichards.eth (@samonchain) September 12, 2025 From Cryptography Lab to Privacy Stewardship Mission PSE abandoned its previous approach of pursuing “cool tech” for concrete problem-solving focused on ecosystem outcomes rather than internal projects. The rebrand includes website updates to pse.dev and restructured team goals with particular emphasis on subtraction by default and problem-driven resource allocation. The strategy involves continuous problem mapping, execution decisions across lead-support-monitor engagement levels, and public communication through newsletters, community calls, and working groups. PSE draws inspiration from Protocol and EcoDev announcement simplicity while addressing feedback from Vitalik Buterin, Silviculture Society, and EF management. Key initiatives include PlasmaFold development for private transfers using PCD and folding, targeting proof-of-concept by Devconnect. The team continues to develop the Kohaku privacy wallet, focusing on zk account recovery frameworks and keystore implementation for stealth addresses. Private governance efforts focus on a “State of private voting 2025” report while collaborating with Aragon on protocol integrations. The Institutional Privacy Task Force launches with the EF EcoDev Enterprise team to unblock adoption through privacy specifications and proof-of-concepts. Another key aspect of this new direct is PSE’s data portability. It tracks advances in TLSNotary development for production-ready zkTLS protocols, while building SDKs that enable seamless integration across mobile, server, and browser platforms. Additionally, network privacy initiatives include Private RPC working groups, ORAM solution integration for privacy-preserving state reads, and sphinx mixing protocol implementation for broadcast privacy. The team has stated that it will methodically study ORAM and PIR state-of-the-art techniques while translating research into practical wallet and browser experiences. Industry Experts Warn Public Ledgers Threaten Mass Adoption The privacy push addresses growing concerns from industry veterans about Ethereum’s transparency model. In an interview with Cryptonews in August, British Gold Trust’s Petro Golovko argues public blockchains expose salaries, business deals, and balance sheets, making crypto “unusable for regular people and impossible for institutions. “ Golovko compares current blockchain transparency to the pre-SSL internet, when users refused to enter credit card numbers due to a lack of encryption. He maintains that crypto remains stuck in this vulnerable phase, preventing the scaling that transformed e-commerce into a $6 trillion industry. Imagine if your bank account had a public URL. That’s the reality of crypto today, and why it ""will never scale beyond a niche,” says Petro Golovko. #Crypto #Blockchain #Privacy https://t.co/qQJ1BJInWt — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) August 25, 2025 Institutional adoption concerns center on the exposure of trade secrets and the competitive disadvantage resulting from visible treasury movements. Golovko warns that no board will approve systems exposing supply chains or financial operations globally, limiting crypto to speculation rather than serious commerce. Vitalik Buterin’s April privacy advocacy stemmed from similar concerns about AI-driven surveillance and data misuse eroding personal autonomy. His roadmap outlined four areas for enhancing privacy: anonymous payments, application-level privacy, secure data access, and network obfuscation. The Ethereum co-founder advocated for wallets to integrate tools like Railgun and Privacy Pools, creating “ shielded balances ” that enable private-by-default transactions. He emphasized that separate addresses per dApp would eliminate traceable links between applications while maintaining usability. European regulatory pressure adds urgency to the development of privacy. Community member Eugenio Reggianini outlined GDPR compliance practices that require personal data to remain off-chain, with blockchain nodes relaying only encrypted references or proofs, rather than identifiable information. Looking forward, the team aims to accelerate ecosystem adoption through community initiatives with privacy and robust security at the center of its decentralized identity systems.

At a roughly $33 billion market cap, DOGE has the liquidity and cultural weight to get there, but big caps usually mean slower, steadier gains. If you want fireworks sooner, then you'll need to schedule elsewhere. Little Pepe (LILPEPE) , trading under $0.003 in presale and building the kind of retail momentum that can compress multi-year moves into months. Why DOGE’s $3 is Plausible But Slow DOGE’s path to $3 is driven by the same force that made it famous: retail mania. Analysts projecting $2–$3 rely on repeated meme cycles, influencer-driven volume, and renewed retail appetite. That’s a credible base case, but it’s typically measured in multiples of 5–15x from today, not thousand-fold leaps. In short, it is stable liquidity with a slower percentage upside. Little Pepe’s Rapid-Fire Growth Curve Unlike meme tokens built on little more than hype, Little Pepe (LILPEPE) fuses culture with infrastructure. It’s launching as a Layer-2 blockchain optimized for scalability, speed, and security, three features often missing from meme projects. Its mission is to be the meme chain supporting new launches, staking, and community governance. The presale has become a story in itself. Stage 12 is live at $0.0021, with the next stage climbing to $0.0022. Over $24.8 million has been raised, with more than 15.4 billion tokens sold. Demand is running hot, with each stage closing faster than the last. Entry is simple: register an ERC-20 wallet, complete a few social tasks, and buy in, and every purchase doubles as a mechanical nudge that increases viral reach and on-chain proof of demand. How LILPEPE Could Reach $3 Before DOGE What gives LILPEPE a shot at $3 isn’t abstract math; it’s momentum and structure. The presale price is under $0.003, with the first exchange listings already around $0.003. That means early buyers have a built-in gain before day one. From there, it’s about traction. Many presales that launch with strong demand see their tokens pop 5x–10x in the opening weeks. For LILPEPE, that would put the price closer to $0.03. If major CEX listings follow as the team has hinted, history shows that exposure can easily trigger another big leg higher, sometimes another 10x move. The final driver is culture. If LILPEPE’s meme-first Layer-2 ecosystem gains the viral attention Dogecoin and Shiba Inu enjoyed in their prime, a climb toward the $3 mark stops sounding outrageous. Retail energy, staking rewards, and the project’s launchpad could keep the cycle alive long enough for demand to push prices into whole-dollar territory. Tokenomics, Roadmap, and Fair Play Unlike most meme coins, Little Pepe isn’t vague about its allocations. Tokenomics split across presale (26.5 billion), staking and rewards (13.5 billion), and liquidity, chain reserves, and marketing (60 billion). The structure places community reward and liquidity security at its core. Buying is simple: ETH, USDT, or a credit card. That accessibility broadens its appeal beyond crypto natives. The roadmap caters to meme culture with stages such as “Pregnancy,” “Birth,” and “Growth,” while introducing staking pools, community governance, and a meme launchpad. Anti-bot protection and zero transaction taxes reinforce the fairness angle—a theme retail traders love. Following the presale, the project anticipates major CEX listings, which could lead to a surge in volumes. Early signals from exchanges suggest appetite is already there. Final Word For traders who don’t just want a safe ride to $3 but are chasing the possibility of turning a few hundred dollars into five or six figures, LILPEPE may be the meme coin to watch before the window closes. Dogecoin might need years to grind toward $3 based on sentiment cycles. LILPEPE, thanks to its tiny starting price and aggressive retail push, including the new Mega Giveaway and $777K giveaway pool , has the structural setup to get there first if momentum snowballs.

This projection is based on its current market capitalization of approximately $33 billion, along with its deep-rooted position within the crypto culture. However, such a large cap indicates that while the growth is plausible, it might be gradual relative to smaller, more volatile tokens. On the other side of the spectrum, Little Pepe (LILPEPE) presents an exciting opportunity for investors looking for quicker gains. Despite its current low entry cost under $0.003, the token is quickly gaining traction, suggesting a potential explosive rise in its value, much steeper than that of Dogecoin. The Journey to $3: Dogecoin's Steady Climb The climb to $3 for Dogecoin is reflective of its enduring popularity and the cyclical nature of retail investment in the crypto market. The slow yet steady growth trajectory aligns with its established market presence and widespread community support. This growth, while not meteoric, is supported by continuous cultural relevance and periodic surges in investor interest. The Rapid Ascent of Little Pepe Contrasting sharply with Dogecoin, Little Pepe is building a platform designed for rapid growth. This Layer-2 blockchain project emphasizes scalability, speed, and security—attributes that are often underdeveloped in meme-centric crypto projects. With its infrastructure set to support new token launches and community-driven governance, Little Pepe is not just any meme token; it's a foundational technology in the meme coin ecosystem. Why Little Pepe Might Hit $3 Before Dogecoin The structure and strategy behind Little Pepe’s market entry could enable it to reach the $3 mark much quicker than Dogecoin. Starting from a price just below $0.003 and with a sales strategy that escalates its value with each presale stage, the token is set for early gains immediately upon its broader market launch. Coupled with aggressive marketing and community-building efforts, including a Mega Giveaway and a substantial $777K giveaway pool , Little Pepe is poised for a significant breakout. Comparative Analysis and Future Outlook While Dogecoin's journey towards $3 appears to be a path of steady appreciation, Little Pepe could surprise the market with sudden, sharp increases in value. The difference in their approaches—steady growth versus rapid scaling—illustrates the diverse strategies within the crypto market.

The project has raised over $15.68 million from over 16,280 supporters in presale. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is poised to deliver exponential growth that few cryptos get to deliver and turn $500 into $20,000. Solana Near $235 as Investors Prefer Growth Opportunities Solana (SOL) stands at $233.05. It has held tight above vital support at $220, buoyed by ongoing developer demand and increasing adoption of its expanded transactional infrastructure. Resistance is at $250; a neat breakout over this would leave the doors open to further runs to higher levels of about $270–$300. Meanwhile, new DeFi ventures such as Mutuum Finance are creating increasing interest alongside it. Mutuum Finance Presale Speed up Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is also thriving in phase six of presale, raking in tremendous traction as investors’ volumes keep increasing. The project has already seen over 16,280 registered owners and has accumulated over $15.68 million in locked capital, with recent action pointing towards the speed continuing to increase. Such a huge surge is a clear indication of growing investors’ confidence as the platform continues to move closer to launching. Strategic Value for Early Entrants Not only are investors investing at the presale tier being exposed to tokens at significantly lower cost, but they are also setting themselves up for massive short-term profits of up to 300 percent on day one of launch, and even greater long-term potential as the ecosystem continues to build. Early adopters are rallying behind a project on the basis of very advanced dual lending model, longevity-long-term-conceived stablecoin, highly audited and open-source codebase, and tokenomics to generate scarcity and appreciation. Add all of them together, and Mutuum Finance is a very highly capable contender to shape the next level of DeFi innovation. Bug Bounty Program Securing Security In a further push to encourage security in its ecosystem, Mutuum Finance has joined forces with CertiK to launch an official bug bounty program backed by a 50,000 USDT bounty pool. Reward is offered based on four levels of severity, namely critical, major, minor, and low, so that any type of vulnerability can be discovered and fixed. By leaving itself open to external developer and researcher scrutiny of its platform, Mutuum adopts proactive security controls, also enhancing security and trust to its investing community. Risk Controls Embedded and Market Provisions Mutuum’s Tiered Loan-to-Value percentages and liquidation points differ depending on the volatility of the underlying collateral. The less volatile assets experience greater borrowing, while riskier tokens have more restricted borrowing. The second stability is covered by reserve multipliers, which range from approximately 10 percent for low-volatility products to as much as 35 percent for riskier products. The system is well balanced in terms of access and security, allowing for more participation in the market and constraining systemic risk. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is quickly becoming the altcoin to watch as it sweeps across Stage 6 of presale. At $0.035, the project has raised $15.68M from 16,280+ investors so far with a positive trend. Early supporters would be able to see 300% returns on token launch and possible long-term growth that can take $500 to $20,000 by 2025. Backed by a dual-lending protocol, a USD-pegged stablecoin, and a $50K CertiK bug bounty, MUTM finds a balance between scalability and security. As Solana (SOL) reaches a peak of $233 and aims for the resistance level of $250, Mutuum Finance offers the investor a chance to buy a discounted ticket to DeFi expansion for multi-exponential returns. Invest now in Stage 6 before prices rise in Stage 7.

Shorter-term levels mentioned by traders include resistance near $0.26 and a next target around $0.45. Price action shows five green sessions out of the last six and a tight range forming between the 200-day EMA and that resistance zone, signs that buying pressure has increased in the near term.

Prob Thur. https://t.co/Lzk2pCVo0E — Eric Balchunas (@EricBalchunas) September 11, 2025 Whales, Volume And Technical Signals Reports have highlighted strong whale buys at current levels. The token briefly rose to about $0.2840, its highest reading since July 21, and 24-hour volume has climbed above $5 billion. The monthly RSI recently posted a positive crossover, a technical hint some traders call bullish. Still, many warn that a firm monthly close will be needed to confirm a longer trend change and that quick swings remain possible. Market Context And What Comes Next A clean move above $0.26 is being watched as a confirmation point by several traders. If that level gives way, momentum could carry prices to $0.45 and then to $0.80 under a sustained buying wave. The ETF timing matters: calendar shifts like the recent delay can nudge sentiment, but the rally has continued even without the fund listing, suggesting other buyers are already positioning ahead of any formal launch.

Peter Brandt called the move a “huge breakthrough”, a phrase that captures why traders are watching the monthly close and whether the coin can press toward targets like $0.6533 and levels near its $0.73 ATH.

The closed-door session took place at Spain’s Palacio de Santa Cruz, with both delegations arriving early that morning. Scott Bessent, U.S. Treasury Secretary, and Jamieson Greer, U.S. Trade Representative, showed up minutes before China’s Vice Premier He Lifeng and Li Chenggang, the country’s top trade negotiator. According to U.S. officials briefed by the Treasury Department , this was the fourth meeting in four months between both teams. The last one was in Stockholm in July, where they agreed to a 90-day trade pause that temporarily stopped some tariffs and resumed rare-earth exports from China to the U.S, as Cryptopolitan reported. That pause is still in effect. President Donald Trump has now extended the current 55% tariffs on Chinese goods until November 10. Trade experts say no one is expecting any breakthrough in Madrid. This round of talks is happening mainly to stop the situation from getting worse. Spain, meanwhile, is using the meeting to show it can host high-stakes diplomacy. Madrid wants to become a central stage for other global disputes, including the Israel-Palestine conflict. TikTok deadline extension likely again ByteDance, the Chinese owner of TikTok, has until September 17 to sell its U.S. operations or face a ban. The U.S. government had already given three extensions. It looks like they’ll hand out a fourth one. A senior official close to the White House said, “a deal is not expected, but the deadline will be extended.” TikTok wasn’t even part of earlier trade discussions in Geneva, London, or Stockholm, but now it’s officially listed on the Treasury’s meeting agenda. The decision to include TikTok gives the Trump administration a reason to delay enforcement while showing action. This political balancing act isn’t going over well in Congress, where both parties had voted to force a sale for national security reasons. Trump, who just opened his own TikTok account last month, has not commented directly on the timing. Wendy Cutler, former deputy U.S. Trade Representative and current head of the Asia Society Policy Institute, said the administration may be saving any real decisions on TikTok for a bigger moment. “I expect major deliverables to be held until a possible Trump-Xi meeting later this year, maybe during APEC in Seoul,” she said . Cutler also pointed out that if any agreement happens, it might also involve easing soybean restrictions, dropping fentanyl-related tariffs, and addressing U.S. export controls. But Cutler warned that the deeper U.S. demands on China, like forcing Beijing to change its economy to rely more on domestic spending instead of subsidized exports, could drag on for years. “Unless there’s some breakthrough on its demands to China, I don’t see the U.S. giving up any leverage,” she added. Washington presses G7 to target China’s Russian oil deals Scott used the Madrid talks to pressure America’s G7 allies to slap tariffs on Chinese and Indian goods over their continued oil imports from Russia. He had already urged the group on Friday to act fast. In a joint statement with Greer, Scott said, “Only with a unified effort that cuts off the revenues funding Putin’s war machine at the source will we be able to apply sufficient economic pressure to end the senseless killing.” The U.S. already slapped an extra 25% tariff on Indian goods, but hasn’t done the same to China, yet. The G7 finance ministers, also meeting this week, discussed this demand and agreed to speed up discussions about using frozen Russian assets to fund Ukraine’s defense. The Madrid meeting also included talks about illicit tech shipments. The U.S. wants China to stop selling certain goods to Russia that are allegedly helping the war effort in Ukraine. The Treasury has labeled this a key issue, referring to it as “combating money laundering,” though the core focus is enforcement and tech surveillance. China’s Ministry of Commerce confirmed that it would respond to U.S. complaints and bring up its own: the ongoing tariffs, the expanding export bans, and the growing list of tech restrictions. Beijing is also expected to push back on Washington’s aggressive use of economic tools to restrict competitors. None of these positions has changed in recent meetings. José Manuel Albares, Spain’s Foreign Minister, welcomed the delegations personally before the session. A senior Spanish government official said Madrid sees the meeting as proof that Spain is now viewed as a serious location for high-level diplomacy. “Spain is pushing to host a major peace summit on the Israel-Palestine war,” the official said. Spain is also using the event to fix its own tension with the Trump administration. Madrid has refused to meet NATO’s defense spending target and has been openly critical of Israel’s actions in Gaza. The country also annoyed Scott back in April by calling Beijing a strategic partner, right as Trump was tightening his tariff campaign. Scott responded at the time, saying, “That’s like cutting your own throat.” Get seen where it counts.

The drain attack has since prompted intense immediate emergency responses. Hacker Uses Bridge Funds To Seize 4.6M BONE In an X post on September 13, the development team behind the Shiba Inu (SHIB) token revealed that a hacker leveraged funds from an earlier bridge hack to acquire 4.6 million BONE tokens in a single block, mimicking a flash loan-style transaction. This maneuver temporarily granted the malicious actor significant validator voting power to sign a malicious state on the Shibarium network, where BONE functions as the governance token. Notably, the flash loan-like transactions were settled using assets transferred directly from the bridge in the form of 224.57 Ethereum (ETH) ($1.05 million) and 92.6 billion SHIB ($1.30 million). However, the BONE tokens remain locked with validators due to staking mechanisms, preventing the attacker from withdrawing them immediately. Nevertheless, the validator compromise highlighted a critical issue for the Ethereum layer 2 solution. The Shiba Inu team notes that evidence suggests that 10 of 12 validators’ signing keys were breached, leaving only K9 Finance and Unification validators resisting the malicious signing attempt. In addition, other assets, including LEASH ($645,000), ROAR ($284,000), TREAT ($50,000), BAD ($17,000), and SHIFU ($10,000), were also drained but have not been sold. Meanwhile, the hacker’s attempt to offload approximately $700,000 worth of stolen KNINE tokens was thwarted after the K9 Finance DAO multisig blacklisted their address, effectively freezing 248 billion KNINE permanently. Shibarium Team Shares Security Response And Next Steps In the immediate aftermath, the Shiba Inu team has halted staking and unstaking functions to safeguard community assets. Meanwhile, stake manager funds were also moved from proxy contracts into a secure 6-of-9 hardware multisig wallet. In addition, Blockchain security teams such as Hexens, Seal911, and PeckShield have also been onboarded to conduct a forensic investigation into the breach. In other developments, Shiba Inu developer with X username Kaal Dhairya confirmed that while damage control and investigations are underway, the team is open to negotiating with the hacker, offering leniency and even a potential small bounty should the stolen assets be returned. Following the hack, the Shibarium ecosystem tokens have varying degrees of a negative price reaction. Notably, the Shiba Inu (SHIB) trades at 0.000014 following a slight 1.67% decline in the last day. Meanwhile, LEASH and BONE are down by 5.69% and 21.98% respectively, within the same period.",Shiba Inu|BONE|Ethereum|KNINE|LEASH|shib|Shibarium,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|SHIB|ETH|BLOCKCHAIN|TRADING,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-09-14 15:00:54

Visser stated that institutional cryptocurrency investments are expected to increase in the fourth quarter in preparation for next year. Related News: This Altcoin's Developer Broke Project's Promise: Announced They Will Mint Additional Tokens Visser also expressed optimism about Ethereum's development in the interview. He noted that the current ETH price is consolidating between $4,000 and $5,000. He added that if Ethereum achieves a real breakthrough and success, the entire ecosystem will accelerate, allowing other cryptocurrencies like DOGE and SUI to flourish. In the interview, Visser and Pompliano also touched on topics such as the impact of AI on the economy, changes in the labor market, and the future of interest rates. Visser argued that traditional economists, while focusing on inflation data, are overlooking the profound economic changes brought about by AI. According to Visser, the demand for AI infrastructure is leading to the construction of a massive physical infrastructure that will also impact the industrial sector. *This is not investment advice.

The biggest meme coin in the world is up a whopping 32% this month so far. Many believe this is just the trailer, as DOGE is simply showing what’s to come ahead of a potential full-blown altcoin season. Dogecoin’s current rally is coming from a major technical breakout. The token crept up above a descending triangle pattern on September 7, and has since then coughed up a one-sided move. Interestingly, $DOGE is rallying despite a delay in the launch of a DOGE ETF. According to a September 8 US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) filing, the Rex-Osprey DOGE ETF (DOJE) was expected to list on Friday. However, it has now been pushed to next week , according to Bloomberg’s senior ETF analyst Eric Balchunas. Read on as we unpack Dogecoin’s potential, the factors pushing it, and how you can make the most of this upcoming rally by buying Maxi Doge ($MAXI) – a Dogecoin-inspired meme coin currently in presale. ETF Expectations & Institutional Purchases Pushing DOGE The launch of the Rex-Osprey DOGE ETF might have been postponed, but it’s still approved and will hit the markets in a few days’ time. To the uninitiated, a DOGE ETF would essentially increase the token’s demand – because it would boost retail participation by offering seamless exposure through traditional brokerage accounts. That said, Balchunas noted that the effect of DOGE ETFs (he expects 4-5 of them to launch in October or November) wouldn’t be as significant as, say, Bitcoin ETFs. That’s because in the case of Bitcoin, there were a lot of retail investors who couldn’t interact with crypto directly. That number, however, is a lot less with DOGE. Balchunas believes folks interested in DOGE, which is relatively more niche than Bitcoin, might already have crypto wallets set up. The amount of effect aside, the bottom line remains that DOGE ETFs will undoubtedly be positive for the token. On top of that, institutional players have been stacking up DOGE at record pace. Just last week, CleanCore Solutions bought $130M worth of DOGE , reaching half of its $1B Dogecoin treasury target. Moreover, Thumzup, which is a Trump family-linked media corporation, recently announced plans to acquire 3,500 Dogecoin mining rigs . All in all, the world’s first meme coin is all set to churn out some mind-boggling returns in the coming months. Want to make the most of it? Consider loading up on a low-cap Doge-based meme coin like Maxi Doge ($MAXI) . Understanding Maxi Doge’s Unique Appeal What is Maxi Doge ? On paper, it’s another dog-themed new meme coin aiming to become the next big breakout winner. But that’s putting it too simply. Think of Maxi as a beefed-up, angrier, and more determined version of the OG Dogecoin, who actually happens to be Maxi’s cousin. Growing up, Doge hogged all the limelight, leaving Maxi lonely, depressed, and questioning his existence. However, unlike other meme coins that bow down to Dogecoin’s ‘greatness,’ Maxi decided to challenge it. Maxi hit the gym, lifted heavy, drowned protein shakes, and spent hours in front of the charts to become the ultimate Doge rival. Thanks to this unhinged philosophy, crypto degens have flocked Maxi Doge’s presale , which has already gathered a massive $2.1M. Each token is currently priced at just $0.000257, and here’s our step-by-step guide on how to buy $MAXI . $MAXI’s Masterplan to Overtake Dogecoin Probably the only way Maxi Doge has a shot at overthrowing Dogecoin as the best meme coin on the planet is to go insanely viral. To do exactly that, Maxi’s developers have reserved a whopping 40% of the total token supply for marketing. This will include influencer collaborations, PR campaigns, and social media blitzes, as well as holder-only events like weekly trading competitions and leaderboard prizes. Beyond simple virality, $MAXI also plans to provide degen meme coin traders the perfect opportunity to eye eight-figure returns. How? By aiming for a futures listing. Doing so would allow $MAXI traders to take huge leveraged positions, which would increase their buying power and, therefore, potential profits. Buy $MAXI While It’s Still in Presale It’s important to understand why you shouldn’t delay your Maxi Doge purchase. You see, meme coins like Dogecoin and Maxi Doge move in huge impulses rather than slowly and steadily like traditional instruments, such as stocks and commodities. That’s why getting involved is crucial. Because waiting for $MAXI to list on exchanges could mean losing out on thousands of percentage worth of gains. As mentioned earlier, the project is currently in presale, which is why it’s available for a super-low price of $0.000257 per token. Plus, according to our Maxi Doge price prediction , the token could reach $0.0024 by the end of 2025. That would be a staggering 830% gain from current levels. Visit Maxi Doge’s official website to learn more about its unique mission, roadmap, and tokenomics. Disclaimer: None of the above constitutes financial advice.

The incident, which was brought to the notice of the public on X, left the YU stablecoin under pressure on Sunday after its value dropped as low as $0.2046, before partially recovering. The team said all user funds remained safe and that Bitcoin deposits on the protocol remained either self-custodial or stored in vaults. Yala under pressure Yala confirmed that the disruption briefly destabilized YU’s peg, prompting the temporary suspension of its Convert and Bridge features. Other services remain unaffected, according to the team. “We’ve identified issues and, as a precaution, paused some product features. Please wait for our green light before re-engaging,” Yala wrote on X . “All user assets remain safe. We’re focused on reinforcing stability and making the protocol even more robust,” it wrote in a previous post on X. The protocol is working with blockchain security firm SlowMist and other partners to investigate the incident and reinforce safeguards. Yala added that a full post-mortem and action plan would be released once the review is complete. Yala refutes exploit claims While Yala has described the episode as an “attempted attack”, on-chain data provided by blockchain analytics firm Lookonchain says otherwise, as the exploit looks successful. The attacker was able to mint 120 million YU tokens on Polygon. According to on-chain data, 7.71 million YU was bridged to Ethereum and Solana, where it was exchanged for $7.7 million in USDC. The funds were subsequently swapped into 1,501 ETH and dispersed across multiple wallets. Lookonchain added that the attacker still controls 22.29 million YU on Ethereum and Solana, while another 90 million YU remains on Polygon, unbridged. The allegations, if confirmed, would indicate a significant vulnerability in Yala’s cross-chain infrastructure. Yala has so far refrained from confirming any losses, insisting that no user funds were compromised and reiterating that its Bitcoin reserves remain secure. Peg stability in question YU is designed as an over-collateralized Bitcoin-backed stablecoin intended to hold parity with the US dollar. The token, with a market capitalization of roughly $140 million as of the time of writing, trades on decentralized exchanges but has limited liquidity, with just $339,000 in USDC liquidity in its Ethereum pool, according to DEX Screener . It is currently trading around $0.7836 there. Its USDC liquidity pool on Solana is relatively better, trading at $0.9997, with a liquidity pool of $14.9 million. At its worst, YU dropped below $0.2046 but rebounded to $0.91 before sliding again, and it’s currently priced at $0.9259 according to CoinMarketCap as at the time of writing. The incident comes amid the rapid expansion of the global stablecoin sector. According to data from CoinMarketCap, the market briefly touched $300 billion this month, driven largely by the dominance of Tether’s USDT , Circle’s USDC, and newer entrants such as Ethena Labs’ USDe making it to the top three list. For Yala, the challenge now lies in restoring YU’s peg and rebuilding trust among users. It also has to fix the technical flaws that made its platform vulnerable to the exploit.

Analysts predict the altcoin could skyrocket to $15,000 before 2026. The asset looks poised for an extended bull run to hit $15,000 by 2026. Meanwhile, a new DeFi newcomer, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) , is gearing up to lead the next big market rally. Price for MUTM remains at $0.035 in its fast-growing presale. Investors will be witnessing price increasing by 14.3% in the next stage. Over 16.28 million investors are poised to get their tokens on launch date after buying them early during the ongoing phase. Though ETH’s steady trend is an indicator of dominance by experienced smart contract chains, MUTM is fast becoming a high-potential disruptor of this season with next-gen DeFi solutions combined with innovative tokenomics that can potentially redefine yield opportunities. Ethereum (ETH) Price Update Ethereum (ETH) is at $4,499.10, with a 24-hour trading volume of about $39.8 billion. The price has remained extremely stable, with an intraday high of $4,531.56 and an intraday low of $4,392.37. Future worth of ETH varies in terms of the projections of experts. Based on some projections, Ethereum will be worth about $11,000 in 2026 due to continued development and growth. More bullish predictions point to the crypto hitting $15,000 or $17,000 in 2026. This growth is heavily driven by whale accumulations, ETF inflows and growing treasury interest. While Ethereum continues to lead the market higher, ETH-based altcoins like Mutuum Finance (MUTM) are also showing bullish signals. The new DeFi altcoin is set to hit $1 before the end of 2025. Mutuum Finance Phase 6 Presale Mutuum Finance is at Stage 6 presale and offering tokens at $0.035. The presale has progressed very fast, and the investors have already raised more than $15.68 million.

Tracked treasury entities added 47,718 BTC last month ($5.2 billion), down from more than 100,000 BTC in July, according to the latest Bitcoin Treasuries Adoption Report . That brought total holdings across public companies, private firms, governments and ETFs to 3.68 million BTC, valued at $400 billion at month-end. The monthly increase of 1.2% was far weaker than July’s 4.6%. This easing in BTC acquisitions by corporate entities could offer an explanation for BTC's rally to $123,000 not being sustained. Bitcoin hit an all-time high in mid August, but fell over 11.5% by the end of the month to sit below $109,000. The slowdown came despite aggressive fundraising announcements. More than $15 billion in equity raises were outlined by treasury firms including Strategy (MSTR), KindlyMD (NAKA) and Metaplanet (3350). Those commitments have yet to translate into immediate purchases, leaving a gap between fundraising headlines and actual market impact. Even with the softer pace, August saw important milestones. Public company holdings crossed the 1 million BTC threshold for the first time, doubling from late 2024, according to the report. Among individual firms, healthcare company KindlyMD made the second-largest buy of the month with a 5,744 BTC purchase worth $679 million. Japan’s Metaplanet added 1,859 BTC across four different transactions. Crypto exchange Bullish (BLSH) also joining the treasury rankings after its August IPO. The firm revealed it has held 24,000 BTC since March, valued at $2.6 billion at the end of August. CEO Tom Farley described the company’s strategy as part of an ongoing institutional wave, telling CNBC it “feels like institutional investors think this could be the moment."" The exchange's parent company Bullish Global is also the owner of CoinDesk. Despite those high-profile moves, the aggregate value of tracked treasuries fell from $428 billion in July to $400 billion in August as bitcoin’s price eased to $108,695 by the end of the month.",Markets|Bitcoin|Bitcoin Treasury Reserve Asset|News,EN,0,0,BTC|CRYPTOCURRENCY|DIGITAL ASSET TREASURY|TRADING|MACROECONOMICS,"{'name': 'CoinDesk', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/5/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coindesk,2025-09-14 16:00:00

New data show U.S.-listed ETFs have become a dominant force in capital markets. According to a Friday press release by ETFGI, an independent consultancy, assets invested in U.S. ETFs hit a record $12.19 trillion at the end of August, up from $10.35 trillion at the close of 2024. Bloomberg, which highlighted the surge on Friday, noted the flows are challenging the traditional influence of the Federal Reserve. Investors poured $120.65 billion into ETFs during August alone, lifting year-to-date inflows to $799 billion — the highest on record. By comparison, the prior full-year record was $643 billion in 2024. The growth is concentrated among the biggest providers. iShares leads with $3.64 trillion in assets, followed closely by Vanguard with $3.52 trillion and State Street’s SPDR family at $1.68 trillion. Together, those three firms control nearly three-quarters of the U.S. ETF market. Equity ETFs drew the largest share of August inflows at $42 billion, while fixed-income funds added $32 billion and commodity ETFs nearly $5 billion. Crypto-linked ETFs are now a meaningful piece of the picture. Data from SoSoValue show U.S.-listed spot bitcoin and ether ETFs manage more than $120 billion combined, led by BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) and Fidelity’s Wise Origin Bitcoin Trust (FBTC). Bitcoin ETFs alone account for more than $100 billion, equal to about 4% of bitcoin’s $2.1 trillion market cap. Ether ETFs add another $20 billion, despite launching only earlier this year. The surge underscores how ETFs — traditional and crypto alike — have become the vehicle of choice for investors of all sizes. For many, the flows are automatic. In the U.S., much of the cash comes from retirement accounts known as 401(k)s, where workers put aside part of every paycheck. A growing share of that money goes into “target-date funds.” These funds automatically shift investments — moving gradually from stocks into bonds — as savers approach retirement age. Model portfolios and robo-advisers follow similar rules, automatically directing flows into ETFs without investors making day-to-day choices. Bloomberg described this as an “autopilot” effect: every two weeks, millions of workers’ contributions are funneled into index funds that buy the same baskets of stocks , regardless of valuations, headlines or Fed policy. Analysts cited by Bloomberg say this steady demand helps explain why U.S. equity indexes keep climbing even as data on jobs and inflation show signs of strain. The trend raises questions about the Fed’s influence. Traditionally, interest rate cuts or hikes sent strong signals that rippled through stocks, bonds, and commodities. Lower rates typically encouraged risk-taking, while higher rates reined it in. But with ETFs absorbing hundreds of billions of dollars on a set schedule, markets may be less sensitive to central bank cues. That tension is especially clear this month. With the Fed expected to cut rates by a quarter point on Sept. 17, stocks sit near record highs and gold trades above $3,600 an ounce. Bitcoin, meanwhile, is trading at around $116,000, not far from its all-time high of $124,000 set in mid August. Stock, bond and crypto ETFs have seen strong inflows, suggesting investors are positioning for easier money — but also reflecting a structural tide of passive allocations. Supporters told Bloomberg the rise of ETFs has lowered costs and broadened access to markets. But critics quoted in the same report warn that the sheer scale of inflows could amplify volatility if redemptions cluster in a downturn, since ETFs move whole baskets of securities at once. As Bloomberg put it, this “perpetual machine” of passive investing may be reshaping markets in ways that even the central bank struggles to counter.",Markets|Federal Reserve|ETFs|Crypto|News,EN,0,0,MACROECONOMICS|MARKET|CRYPTOCURRENCY|BTC|BUSINESS,"{'name': 'CoinDesk', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/5/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coindesk,2025-09-14 16:02:27

From the introduction of Form 1099-DA to new requirements for brokers, ETFs, and eventually DeFi platforms, the coming changes will redefine how individuals and institutions navigate their crypto tax obligations. In this interview, Lawrence Zlatkin, Vice President of Tax at Coinbase, outlines what these changes mean, the common misconceptions investors should avoid, and the strategies that can help taxpayers stay compliant while minimizing liability. What counts as a taxable event under the new rules? For example, is exchanging one cryptocurrency for another, using crypto for goods or services, or moving crypto between wallets all treated the same? The kinds of taxable events remain unchanged in the new tax season. So if you were paid in crypto, sold your assets, exchanged cryptocurrencies, or used crypto to pay for goods and services, these are all considered taxable events by the IRS and will need to be accounted for come tax season. Under the new rules in 2026, though, Coinbase and other brokers will be required to report your crypto sales and exchanges to the IRS, and you using the new Form 1099-DA for the 2025 tax year. For 2025 transactions, your copy of the form will display both cost basis and gross proceeds, but Coinbase will report only gross proceeds to the IRS. For transactions in and after 2026, your copy will again display both cost basis and gross proceeds. However, Coinbase will only report the cost basis for crypto you purchased through Coinbase, alongside all gross proceeds. Moving crypto between wallets is not a taxable transaction since you still hold the same crypto asset before and after. Given that many users have transferred assets between wallets, exchanges, or acquired crypto well before 2025/2026, what strategies do you recommend for investors to accurately reconstruct the cost basis for those non-covered assets? What records are most important to preserve now? Ensuring that you keep records of the price you purchased those assets, regardless of which platform that purchase originated, is key. Make sure to also include all transaction or gas fees that were paid as part of that purchase, since those “expenses” may be included in basis and used to offset future taxable gains. What safe harbors or guidance exist for investors to choose their method of cost basis allocation Coinbase customers can manage their cost basis method in their tax center settings within the platform. From there, they can currently choose between a HIFO (highest in, first out), LIFO (last in, first out), and FIFO (first in, first out) method. We always urge customers to make sure they consult a tax professional before choosing a strategy. Many investors hold spot Bitcoin ETFs or Ethereum ETFs. Under the new IRS reporting regulations coming in 2026, how do these ETFs get treated differently? What requirements will ETF investors have, and what should investors in these ETFs do now to prepare for accurate tax reporting of their ETF gains or losses? Most ETFs will be treated as trusts or “look thru” entities for the investor. It’s as if you held the BTC or ETH yourself. The ETF or the custodian for the ETF should report your sales as though you exchanged or sold the crypto asset yourself. ETFs are convenient for owning crypto assets, but they will not change how you are taxed. DeFi platforms will be treated differently. Could you walk us through what exactly DeFi brokers will need to report – and what they won’t – once the rules take effect in 2027? Also, what transitional reliefs and timing should DeFi users and DeFi front-end providers be aware of now? In the absence of reporting from DeFi providers, it’s important for DeFi users to maintain their personal documentation of all transactions in order to make tax reporting less of a headache until 2027 rolls around. DeFi transactions may not be reported to the IRS, but they are subject to the same tax rules as CeFi transactions, and you will need to report your transactions, gains, and losses to the IRS just as you would with CeFi. Those transacting in DeFi should also be wary that transactions on centralized exchanges are not the only taxable transactions. Personal wallet transactions and DeFi activities can also be subject to taxes. Beyond simply compliance, what legal strategies do investors often underestimate that can help minimize crypto tax liability under these new rules? I encourage each individual investor to consult a qualified tax professional for their specific circumstances and what’s right for them, but there are several strategies that are often overlooked. Tax-loss harvesting allows you to offset gains by selling underperforming assets, while choosing the right cost basis method can help reduce taxable gains. These both require strong record-keeping, but can do some heavy lifting in lowering tax bills. There are a lot of misconceptions floating around in the crypto community about how taxation works. What are some of the most common myths or rumors you hear about crypto taxes, and can you explain why they are wrong and what the realities are? One big misconception is that many think crypto is treated as a currency by the IRS, when it actually treats crypto as property. Going back to one of your earlier questions, this means that selling, exchanging, or even using crypto to buy goods can trigger taxable events. Another misconception is that you don’t have to pay taxes on crypto transactions if they are not reported to the IRS. Not true. Reporting helps you calculate your taxes, and it helps the IRS find taxpayers who don’t report their income. But you alone are responsible for your taxes, and reporting is only a guide or tool to help.

Imagine the tech giants, once thought to hold the keys to the AI kingdom, potentially being relegated to the role of “selling coffee beans to Starbucks.” This striking analogy encapsulates a growing sentiment: the AI boom might just leave AI’s biggest foundation model companies behind, turning them into low-margin suppliers while nimbler AI startups carve out immense value at the application layer. This dramatic reorientation of the competitive landscape presents both unforeseen challenges for established players like OpenAI and Anthropic , and unprecedented opportunities for innovation. Foundation Models: The Shifting Sands of AI Power For years, the narrative was clear: the future of AI belonged to the companies developing colossal foundation models . These models, like those powering ChatGPT, were built through immense pre-training on vast datasets, promising an insurmountable lead. However, recent developments suggest this foundational advantage is hitting diminishing returns. The initial scaling benefits of pre-training have slowed, diverting attention towards post-training, fine-tuning, and reinforcement learning as the new frontiers of progress. What does this mean for the industry? Consider these points: Diminishing Returns: The massive investments in pre-training for ever-larger models are no longer yielding proportional improvements. This means simply throwing more data and compute at a model doesn’t guarantee a significant leap in performance. Post-Training Ascendance: The real innovation is now happening in customizing and refining models for specific tasks. Building a better AI coding tool, for instance, benefits more from fine-tuning and interface design than from another multi-billion-dollar pre-training run. Commoditization Risk: As foundation models become increasingly interchangeable, they risk becoming a commodity. This strips away their price leverage, potentially forcing them into a back-end supplier role with lower margins. This shift challenges the long-held belief that the most complex, resource-intensive work (building the foundation) would capture the lion’s share of the value. Instead, the focus is moving to how these models are applied and integrated into user-facing solutions. AI Startups: From “Wrappers” to Innovators Once dismissed as mere “GPT wrappers,” AI startups are now at the forefront of this transformation. These companies are no longer just building simple interfaces on top of existing models; they are deeply engaged in customizing AI for specific tasks, integrating advanced interface work, and developing specialized applications. Their agility allows them to pivot quickly and exploit niches that larger foundation model companies might overlook. The key insight driving these startups is the belief that a foundation model can be swapped in and out as needed. Their competitive edge comes from: Customization Expertise: Tailoring AI models to deliver precise, high-value solutions for particular industries or functions, solving real-world business problems. Interface Design: Creating intuitive and effective user experiences that leverage AI’s power without requiring users to understand its underlying complexity, making AI accessible. Interchangeability: The ability to switch between models like GPT-5, Claude, or Gemini without impacting the end-user experience, indicating a lack of strong vendor lock-in at the foundational layer. This approach was evident at events like Boxworks, which showcased user-facing software built on top of AI models. It highlights a future where success is less about who built the most powerful generic model, and more about who can deliver the most effective, specialized application. The Changing Competitive Landscape: Why Big Isn’t Always Better The competitive landscape of AI is undergoing a profound metamorphosis. What was once perceived as a race for an all-powerful Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) has fractured into a “flurry of discrete businesses” focusing on specific applications like software development, enterprise data management, or image generation. In this new paradigm, the advantage of simply building a foundation model is increasingly tenuous. Consider the following dynamics shaping the current AI boom: Old Paradigm (Foundation Model Dominance) New Paradigm (Application Layer Dominance) Focus on raw computational power and massive datasets for pre-training. Focus on fine-tuning, customization, and user experience for specific tasks. Belief in an “inherent moat” for foundation model developers. “No inherent moat in the technology stack for AI,” as per venture capitalists. First-mover advantage seen as critical and durable. First-mover advantage often fleeting (e.g., OpenAI’s early coding/image models surpassed). Foundation models expected to capture most value. Value shifts to application layer and specialized solutions, often by AI startups . The abundance of high-quality open-source alternatives further complicates matters. If a proprietary foundation model cannot differentiate itself sufficiently at the application layer, it loses pricing power, potentially reducing its creators to low-margin suppliers. What Does This Mean for OpenAI and Anthropic’s Future? Companies like OpenAI and Anthropic , once seen as the undisputed leaders of the AI revolution, now face a complex challenge. Their success was intertwined with the transformative impact of AI, positioning them as generational companies. While they still possess significant advantages—including strong brand recognition, vast infrastructure, and immense cash reserves—their “durable advantage” in foundation model development is less certain than before. Consider these implications for the giants in this evolving competitive landscape : Shifting Focus: They must adapt from a purely foundational model strategy to one that emphasizes application, fine-tuning, and potentially consumer-facing products. OpenAI’s consumer business, for example, might prove harder to replicate than its coding models. Competitive Pressure: The success of Anthropic’s Claude Code demonstrates that even foundation model companies are adept at post-training and reinforcement learning. However, this also means the competitive field for these specialized applications is wider, with more AI startups entering the fray. Commodity Risk: If their core foundation models become interchangeable commodities, their business model could face severe pressure, forcing them to compete on price rather than innovation. While it’s too early to count them out, the era where merely building the biggest model guaranteed market dominance appears to be waning. Their future success will likely hinge on their ability to diversify, innovate at the application layer, and build defensible moats beyond raw model size. The Road Ahead: Navigating the New AI Frontier The landscape is undeniably dynamic, and predicting the future of AI is a fool’s errand. While the current trend points towards the ascendance of application-layer innovation and the potential commoditization of foundation models , several factors could still shift the narrative. The pace of AI development is incredibly fast; what holds true today could be obsolete in six months. Key areas to watch in this rapidly changing competitive landscape include: Breakthroughs in AGI: A genuine breakthrough in general intelligence could fundamentally alter our understanding of AI value, potentially re-establishing the dominance of foundational research. Imagine new discoveries in pharmaceuticals or materials science driven by AGI. Emerging Advantages: New, durable advantages might yet emerge as the sector matures, perhaps related to data governance, specialized hardware integration, or unique ethical frameworks that are difficult for AI startups to replicate. Consumer Adoption: The success of consumer-facing AI products developed by the OpenAI and Anthropic themselves could create new, harder-to-replicate revenue streams, distinct from their B2B model offerings. However, for now, the strategy of simply building ever-bigger foundation models seems less compelling. The immense spending on pre-training, exemplified by Meta’s multi-billion dollar investments, carries increased risk in this evolving market. The focus is shifting from raw power to refined utility, from broad strokes to precise applications, signaling a maturity in the AI boom. The AI industry is at an inflection point, moving beyond the initial euphoria of massive foundational models to a more nuanced, application-centric reality. While giants like OpenAI and Anthropic possess significant resources, the rising tide of agile AI startups and the commoditization of generic models are forcing a strategic re-evaluation. The “coffee beans to Starbucks” analogy powerfully illustrates a potential future where the true value lies not in the raw ingredients, but in the specialized, user-facing products built upon them. As investors and innovators navigate this exciting, unpredictable terrain, understanding this shift in the competitive landscape is paramount for identifying the next wave of success in the AI boom.

In the post , Xaif highlighted Stokes’ prediction of a more realistic target range for XRP while dismissing the idea of a $10,000 valuation. The video quickly became a focal point for XRP enthusiasts who have long debated the cryptocurrency’s future price trajectory. Adam Stokes’ Forecast for XRP Adam Stokes, a well-known commentator on digital assets and market trends, outlined in the video why he sees a ceiling on XRP’s price. He explained that he owns a significant amount of XRP and would be happy if the asset reached $10,000 . However, he believes such a level is unrealistic because “there’s just not enough money on planet Earth for that.” Instead, Stokes said that “XRP is going to, I think, $4 easily” and that “$5 to $7 is my prediction.” His remarks signal a more conservative but still optimistic view compared to some of the more extreme projections within the XRP community. :Adam Atokes predicts $XRP will reach $5 – $7 Also he thinks $XRP to $10,000 is NOT possible What do you think, #XRPArmy ? pic.twitter.com/3JHgTEtvsn — Xaif Crypto | (@Xaif_Crypto) September 13, 2025 The Significance of the $4 to $7 Range Although his prediction falls far short of the $500 to $10,000 figures some XRP holders promote, Stokes’s range would represent a substantial increase from current levels and mark a new all-time high for the cryptocurrency. His view emphasizes market fundamentals and realistic capital inflows rather than speculative extremes. By highlighting $4 as an attainable price, he reinforced that XRP could still achieve considerable growth without relying on improbable valuations.

As ADA continues to battle a crucial $0.90 resistance level amid 4% price swings and regional trading surges from Japan, this new Ethereum Layer 2 memecoin is demonstrating that speed, utility, and community rewards can create unprecedented growth trajectories that challenge even the most established smart contract platforms. ADA ‘s momentum faces headwinds despite technical recovery signals Cardano price prediction analysis reveals a mixed technical picture as ADA demonstrates V-shaped recovery patterns while struggling against fundamental scalability limitations. The recent 4% price movements and trading surge activity from Japan highlight renewed interest, yet ADA continues trading within a restrictive 10% range that suggests underlying uncertainty about the platform’s competitive positioning. Charles Hoskinson’s roadmap discussions and network developments provide foundation-level improvements, but the pace of innovation appears insufficient against rapidly evolving Layer 2 solutions. While ADA shows resilience at critical support levels, the broader question becomes whether incremental upgrades can compete against revolutionary architectural advances that deliver immediate utility and rewards. Layer Brett emerges as the successor to legacy smart contracts Where traditional platforms like Cardano face congestion and scalability challenges, Layer Brett ($LBRETT) represents a fundamental paradigm shift toward instant transactions and amplified rewards. The project’s over $3.5 million presale momentum demonstrates market confidence that Layer 2 technology solves the core limitations plaguing earlier blockchain generations. Layer Brett’s 700+% staking APY creates immediate value for early participants while the underlying Ethereum Layer 2 infrastructure ensures lightning-fast transactions without the delays that characterize older networks. This isn’t merely another crypto presale—it’s positioning as the next evolution beyond traditional smart contract platforms that struggle with transaction throughput and user experience limitations. Smart money and utility-backed Layer 2 opportunities The gap between ADA’s price prediction potential and Layer Brett’s growth trajectory reflects a broader market rotation toward projects that combine meme energy with tangible technological advantages. While Cardano price prediction models factor in gradual ecosystem development, Layer Brett offers immediate staking rewards and the efficiency benefits of Layer 2 blockchain technology. Global economic tensions and regulatory uncertainty create challenging conditions for established platforms, yet Layer Brett’s community-first approach, with features like the $1 million giveaway, demonstrates how next-generation projects can build momentum regardless of macro headwinds. The mathematical advantage becomes clear: while ADA trades within established ranges, Layer Brett provides asymmetric upside potential for early positioning. Architectural evolution favors the Layer 2 advantage The Cardano price prediction landscape reveals that momentum alone cannot overcome the fundamental advantages of Layer 2 infrastructure that Layer Brett represents. While ADA may hold near-term support levels, the transformative potential lies with projects that deliver immediate utility, enhanced rewards, and the scalability that modern blockchain users demand. The presale window for Layer Brett represents optimal timing for position, but the window is closing fast. Check out the project early to get ahead of this architectural shift.

The event, which occurred hours ago, resulted in an 18-block reorg and invalidated 118 transactions. According to a development reported by OrangeFren in the crypto community, users accepting payments with XMR are advised to wait for more block confirmations instead of the usual 10 confirmations. Yu Xian of blockchain security firm SlowMist compared the incident to the “sword of Damocles.” He argued that if the Monero community doesn't take the risk of a reorg seriously, the network could face the threat of double-spend. He also noted that a 51% hash rate advantage isn't always necessary for this. Related News: Billionaire Entrepreneur Chamath Palihapitiya Says, “Bitcoin Will Replace Gold,” Shares Price Prediction Monero confirms a block approximately every 2 minutes (an average of 720 blocks per day). In the last 720 blocks, 108 orphaned blocks (15%) and 103 blocks (14.31%) came from unknown miners, representing a total orphan block rate of approximately 30%, well above Monero's historical average. Orphaned blocks are a natural occurrence in Proof-of-Work systems, occurring when two miners simultaneously discover a valid block. While this rate typically ranges from 1% to 3%, the current rate is considered “extremely abnormal.” Even in August, when only 5/720 blocks (0.7%) were observed, this rate was reported as “unusual.” In the previous Qubic case, this rate reached a maximum of 8.3% (60/720). *This is not investment advice.

Google AI Summaries are at the heart of a groundbreaking lawsuit, raising critical questions about copyright, fair use, and the economic future of online publishing. As the crypto world grapples with NFTs and decentralized content platforms, the mainstream media’s struggle against tech giants like Google provides a stark parallel, highlighting the universal need for clear digital content rights and equitable value exchange. Penske Media Lawsuit: A Bold Challenge to Google’s AI Ambitions The digital publishing world is buzzing following the announcement of a landmark legal challenge: the Penske Media Lawsuit against Google. Penske Media Corporation (PMC), the influential owner behind iconic publications like Rolling Stone , Billboard , Variety , and The Hollywood Reporter , has taken a firm stand. The core accusation is Google’s alleged illegal use of publishers’ content to generate AI summaries, a practice PMC claims directly undermines their business model and copyright. While this isn’t the first time publishers or authors have sued AI companies over related intellectual property concerns, PMC’s suit marks a significant escalation, specifically targeting Google and its parent company, Alphabet, for their implementation of AI-generated summaries within search results. This legal action underscores a growing tension between content creators and the AI models that consume and repurpose their work, setting a precedent for how Google AI Summaries might operate in the future. Understanding the AI Overviews Impact on Publishers Since their introduction last year, Google’s AI Overviews have been a point of contention. Google touts these summaries as making search “more helpful” and creating “new opportunities for content to be discovered.” However, many publishers, including PMC, argue the opposite. They contend that by providing quick, AI-generated answers directly in search results, Google is effectively cannibalizing the very traffic that sustains their operations. PMC’s lawsuit goes further, accusing Google of leveraging its dominant market position to “coerce PMC into permitting Google to republish PMC’s content in AI Overviews” and to use that content for training its AI models. This raises fundamental questions about fair competition and the ethical use of intellectual property in the age of generative AI. Google spokesperson José Castañeda has stated the company will “defend against these meritless claims,” emphasizing that AI Overviews send traffic to a “greater diversity of sites.” However, the AI Overviews Impact on individual publisher revenue streams remains a critical point of debate. The Publisher Copyright Dilemma: An Unwilling Exchange? At the heart of the Penske Media Lawsuit lies a dispute over the foundational “bargain” of the open web. Traditionally, publishers allowed Google to crawl their websites in an “exchange of access for traffic.” This symbiotic relationship provided Google with content for its search index and, in return, directed users to publisher sites, generating ad, subscription, and affiliate revenue. The lawsuit argues that Google has fundamentally altered this agreement. “As a condition of indexing publisher content for search, Google now requires publishers to also supply that content for other uses that cannibalize or preempt search referrals,” the lawsuit claims. For PMC and other publishers, the only way to opt out of this new arrangement is to remove themselves entirely from Google search, a move described as “devastating” given Google’s market dominance. This puts publishers in a precarious position, challenging the very essence of Publisher Copyright in the digital age. Protecting Digital Content Rights in the AI Era The financial implications for publishers are significant. PMC’s lawsuit specifically highlights “significant declines in clicks from Google searches since Google started rolling out AI Overviews .” Fewer clicks directly translate to less ad revenue, and also threaten vital subscription and affiliate income streams, which “rely on people actually visiting PMC sites.” While Google has pushed back against these complaints, asserting that AI Overviews do not reduce traffic, the lawsuit points out that “Google has offered no credible competing information regarding search referral traffic.” This dispute is not just about lost revenue; it’s about the long-term viability of quality journalism and independent content creation. Ensuring robust Digital Content Rights is paramount for the sustainability of the media ecosystem, particularly as AI models become more sophisticated in content generation and summarization. The outcome of this lawsuit could shape how content creators are compensated and recognized for their work in the AI-driven future. Broader Implications for Google AI Summaries and the Tech Landscape This legal challenge arrives at a critical juncture for Google. The company recently navigated an antitrust trial, where a federal judge ruled it acted illegally to maintain a monopoly in online search. However, the judge ultimately decided against ordering a breakup of Google’s businesses, partly citing increasing competition in the AI space. The Penske Media Lawsuit , by directly challenging Google’s AI practices, re-ignites scrutiny of its market power and influence. It joins a growing chorus of legal actions from authors and publishers against various AI companies, all grappling with the complexities of intellectual property in the age of large language models. The resolution of this case will undoubtedly have far-reaching consequences, potentially redefining the relationship between search engines, AI developers, and the content creators who fuel the digital economy. It will set a precedent for how companies can ethically use publicly available information to train AI and how creators can protect their Publisher Copyright in an increasingly automated world. The Penske Media Lawsuit against Google represents a pivotal moment in the ongoing debate over artificial intelligence, copyright, and the future of digital publishing. As AI technologies continue to advance, the tension between innovation and fair compensation for content creators will only intensify. This case is more than just a dispute between a media conglomerate and a tech giant; it’s a battle for the fundamental principles that underpin the open web and the economic models that sustain quality journalism. The outcome will likely influence how Google AI Summaries are implemented, how Digital Content Rights are enforced, and ultimately, whether content creators can thrive in an AI-dominated search landscape.

This move will likely be followed by more easing in the coming months, taking the rates down to around 3% within the next 12 months. The fed funds futures market is discounting a drop in the fed funds rate to less than 3% by the end of 2026. Bitcoin (BTC) bulls are optimistic that the anticipated easing will push Treasury yields sharply lower, thereby encouraging increased risk-taking across both the economy and financial markets. However, the dynamics are more complex and could lead to outcomes that differ significantly from what is anticipated. While the expected Fed rate cuts could weigh on the two-year Treasury yield, those at the long end of the curve may remain elevated due to fiscal concerns and sticky inflation. Debt supply The U.S. government is expected to increase the issuance of Treasury bills (short-term instruments) and eventually longer-duration Treasury notes to finance the Trump administration's recently approved package of extended tax cuts and increased defense spending. According to the Congressional Budget Office , these policies are likely to add over $2.4 trillion to primary deficits over ten years, while Increasing debt by nearly $3 trillion, or roughly $5 trillion if made permanent. The increased supply of debt will likely weigh on bond prices and lift yields. (bond prices and yields move in the opposite direction). ""The U.S. Treasury’s eventual move to issue more notes and bonds will pressure longer-term yields higher,"" analysts at T. Rowe Price, a global investment management firm, said in a recent report . Fiscal concerns have already permeated the longer-duration Treasury notes, where investors are demanding higher yields to lend money to the government for 10 years or more, known as the term premium. The ongoing steepening of the yield curve – which is reflected in the widening spread between 10- and 2-year yields, as well as 30- and 5-year yields and driven primarily by the relative resilience of long-term rates – also signals increasing concerns about fiscal policy. Kathy Jones, managing director and chief income strategist at the Schwab Center for Financial Research, voiced a similar opinion this month, noting that ""investors are demanding a higher yield for long-term Treasuries to compensate for the risk of inflation and/or depreciation of the dollar as a consequence of high debt levels."" These concerns could keep long-term bond yields from falling much, Jones added. Stubborn inflation Since the Fed began cutting rates last September, the U.S. labor market has shown signs of significant weakening, bolstering expectations for a quicker pace of Fed rate cuts and a decline in Treasury yields. However, inflation has recently edged higher, complicating that outlook. When the Fed cut rates in September last year, the year-on-year inflation rate was 2.4%. Last month, it stood at 2.9%, the highest since January's 3% reading. In other words, inflation has regained momentum, weakening the case for faster Fed rate cuts and a drop in Treasury yields. Easing priced in? Yields have already come under pressure, likely reflecting the market’s anticipation of Federal Reserve rate cuts. The 10-year yield slipped to 4% last week, hitting the lowest since April 8, according to data source TradingView. The benchmark yield has dropped over 60 basis points from its May high of 4.62%. According to Padhraic Garvey, CFA, regional head of research, Americas at ING, the drop to 4% is likely an overshoot to the downside. ""We can see the 10yr Treasury yield targeting still lower as an attack on 4% is successful. But that's likely an overshoot to the downside. Higher inflation prints in the coming months will likely cause long-end yields some issues, requiring a significant adjustment,"" Garvey said in a note to clients last week. Perhaps rate cuts have been priced in, and yields could bounce back hard following the Sept. 17 move, in a repeat of the 2024 pattern. The dollar index suggests the same, as noted early this week . Lesson from 2024 The 10-year yield fell by over 100 basis points to 3.60% in roughly five months leading up to the September 2024 rate cut. The central bank delivered additional rate cuts in November and December. Yet, the 10-year yield bottomed out with the September move and rose to 4.57% by year-end, eventually reaching a high of 4.80% in January of this year. According to ING, the upswing in yields following the easing was driven by economic resilience, sticky inflation, and fiscal concerns. As of today, while the economy has weakened, inflation and fiscal concerns have worsened as discussed earlier, which means the 2024 pattern could repeat itself. What it means for BTC? While BTC rallied from $70,000 to over $100,000 between October and December 2024 despite rising long-term yields, this surge was primarily fueled by optimism around pro-crypto regulatory policies under President Trump and growing corporate adoption of BTC and other tokens. However, these supporting narratives have significantly weakened looking back a year later. Consequently, the possibility of a potential hardening of yields in the coming months weighing over bitcoin cannot be dismissed.

The US central bank, along with the Bank of Canada, Bank of England, and Bank of Japan, will each make their own decisions by Friday, affecting nearly 40% of the global economy. A US rate cut, pushed heavily by President Donald Trump’s administration, is expected to be the central event, with Wall Street, Main Street, and global markets all watching closely. This week’s decisions cover four G7 countries. The Fed’s meeting comes amid growing tension between Trump’s repeated demands for cheaper borrowing and Fed Chair Jerome Powell’s warnings about inflation tied to Trump’s own tariff policies. But recent job market data has given the Fed the green light. Most analysts expect a 25 basis point cut . Canada and Norway are also likely to move in lockstep, while others like South Africa, Brazil, and Indonesia are expected to sit still for now. Canada cuts, UK watches, Japan delays The Bank of Canada is expected to cut its benchmark overnight rate to 2.5%, citing weak job numbers and a second-quarter economic slump. Despite a slight uptick in headline inflation to 2%, core inflation is stable at 3%. Housing data this week will confirm whether the ongoing easing cycle is having any effect on the stagnant real estate market. So far, there’s been no boost. The Bank of England is likely to hold its rate steady at 4%. UK inflation data, dropping one day before the BoE’s decision, is expected to show the headline rate at 3.8%, with a minor decline in the services segment. The central bank had forecast a 4% peak in September. A split vote is expected again as some policymakers push for another immediate cut. The main shift may come from a slowdown in the BoE’s asset sell-off program, which is currently unwinding £100 billion a year in government bonds. With recent volatility, officials are expected to ease up on that pace. Over in Japan, investors are looking ahead to Friday’s policy call by the Bank of Japan, following CPI numbers that show continued inflation pressure. The central bank is not expected to move rates this time. Governor Kazuo Ueda has stayed quiet on timing, though many expect a hike is coming if economic strength holds. Japan’s trade balance and Singapore’s non-oil exports, both due earlier in the week, will also shape investor sentiment in Asia. India’s trade deficit likely narrowed in August, and Pakistan’s central bank is set to hold rates again. China is flooding the week with economic data (retail sales, industrial output, investment, and unemployment numbers), all of which will offer a read on whether recent government support is slowing the country’s downturn. Property stats will show how bad the real estate slump has gotten. China also launched two investigations into US chip companies, escalating tensions in the global tech war. Wall Street prepares for rate decisions and AI-fueled rallies Before the Federal Reserve meets, US retail sales numbers are expected on Tuesday. Economists forecast a 0.3% rise for August, smaller than in previous months. With labor conditions weakening and inflation still high, there’s concern that consumers may start pulling back. Weekly jobless claims data on Thursday will help confirm whether last week’s increase was a blip or the beginning of a trend. While Main Street is showing nerves, just 28% of retail investors called themselves bullish in AAII’s recent survey, Wall Street remains upbeat. Over the past month, Deutsche Bank’s 2025 forecast for the S&P 500 was upgraded to 7,000, Wells Fargo sees 6,650 by year-end, and a rise to 7,200 by 2026. Meanwhile, Barclays moved its 2025 S&P outlook to 6,450, and Yardeni Research gave a 25% chance of a December rally to 7,000. “AI is the dominant theme,” said Venu Krishna, Head of US Equity Strategy at Barclays. “Demand for infrastructure is strong, and the fear that AI will disrupt software is overblown.” Sign up to Bybit and start trading with $30,050 in welcome gifts",Economy|GBP|JPY|USD,EN,0,0,MACROECONOMICS|FIAT|ASIA|BUSINESS|MARKET,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-09-14 16:44:51
51720247,https://partner.cryptopolitan.com/hedera-price-movements-mirror-interest-in-xrp-tundras-cross-chain-technology/,1757868773,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/51720247.jpeg,Hedera Price Movements Mirror Interest in XRP Tundra’s Cross-Chain Technology,https://partner.cryptopolitan.com/hedera-price-movements-mirror-interest-in-xrp-tundras-cross-chain-technology/,"Recent activity around Hedera (HBAR) reveals that institutions are increasingly using its Hashgraph tech for real use cases. The network has been included in SWIFT cross-border trials and is accelerating the tokenization of institutional funds via firms like KAIO. Daily transaction volumes and enterprise adoption are on the rise. In response, investors are showing stronger interest in cross-chain platforms that can deliver high throughput, secure ledger operations, and native yield. XRP Tundra steps into this landscape with a staking protocol built for transparency and dual-chain exposure: staking XRP on XRPL while also operating on Solana, and delivering two tokens for one presale buy. Tundra aims to mirror the kind of technological confidence Hedera is inspiring, and to do so with yield, governance, and utility baked in. Hedera’s Momentum And What It Signals Hedera’s ecosystem expansion is more than headlines. Tokenized funds are now being built on top of Hedera, allowing institutional capital to flow into real-world assets on a distributed ledger layer. Its inclusion in SWIFT’s cross-border trial reflects confidence in its speed, finality, and regulatory structure. Developers and institutions are also showing up: hackathons in Africa tied to Hedera, partnerships for stable tokens and governance candidates for state-level frameworks give HBAR increasing credibility in both enterprise and regulatory spaces. What this momentum signals for the broader market is a trend: networks that combine private-level ledger reliability with cross-chain bridging, yield, and regulatory clarity are being viewed as serious infrastructure bets. That’s the gap XRP Tundra addresses directly. How XRP Tundra Matches The Cross-Chain Trend XRP Tundra’s model aligns with what investors seem to want: combining multiple ledger advantages while maintaining trust, security, and yield. The project allows XRP holders to stake directly on XRPL via Cryo Vaults for periods from 7 to 90 days. Rewards are paid in TUNDRA, and original XRP returns per term. No bridges that risk custody; everything stays on-ledger for XRPL. Simultaneously, Tundra operates on Solana with TUNDRA-S token rewards. The presale gives buyers both tokens (XRPL + Solana) for one purchase, giving them dual exposure across promise and performance. Supporting both chains, Tundra aims to capture users who trust XRPL’s proven performance and also want access to Solana’s DeFi yield space. Trust And Verification Built In Transparency is part of what gives networks like Hedera trust, and Tundra has built similar foundations. The project has passed independent audits with Cyberscope , Solidproof , and Freshcoins . It has also completed KYC for its core team through Vital Block . These reviews cover contract safety, tokenomics, allocation schedules, and team verification. Every vault action and emission schedule is designed to be visible and verifiable. That gives users a stronger basis for trust — especially in cross-chain or multi-ledger contexts where opacity is often a risk. Implications For Investors Hedera’s recent price movements are partly reflections of institutional interest and cross-chain credibility. For investors, that means comparative models matter more than ever. Projects that can deliver native staking, dual-chain exposure, and enforceable audit/KYC standards are rising in perceived value. XRP Tundra sits in that rising category. For those who believe Hedera is moving past proof-of-concept to real financial infrastructure, Tundra offers a similar ambition: yield and utility plus governance and security. Its presale model — two tokens from one purchase — doubles down on cross-chain exposure without making users choose. Key Learnings Interest in Hedera stresses the growing demand for crypto platforms that combine real use-cases with transparency. XRP Tundra shows how staking, dual-token presale, and ledger integrity can meet that demand. For holders who want both yield and multi-ledger exposure, Tundra represents a strong entry point in this evolving landscape.

While Ethereum and Solana continue to dominate headlines, analysts are pointing to a hidden gem: MAGACOIN FINANCE . With its rising presale momentum, attractive tokenomics, and strong early-stage fundamentals, it is emerging as one of the top crypto presales today. At the same time, Layer Brett ($LBRETT) is proving that meme coins can evolve beyond hype, combining Ethereum Layer 2 performance with community-driven energy. Alongside projects like BlockDAG, Bitcoin Hyper, and Remittix, these tokens are making waves in the new crypto presales 2025 market. MAGACOIN FINANCE leads analysts’ watchlists While many investors chase large-cap altcoin, MAGACOIN FINANCE is quietly positioning itself as one of the best presale altcoins to buy this year. This is because its presale stage is drawing in thousands of investors daily with massive funding success and its token price is rising every hour. Key highlights of MAGACOIN FINANCE include: Strong fundamentals and audited smart contract combined with scarce tokenomics. Smart money inflows, with early backers rotating capital from majors into MAGACOIN FINANCE. A 50% bonus for early investors using the PATRIOT50X promo code. Forecasts of 59x gains once the altcoin hits major exchanges. Analysts suggest this project has the hallmarks of a low-cap altcoin with high upside potential. Layer Brett: where meme meets mechanism Are you seeing meme coins as just speculative blabber? Well, layer Brett ($LBRETT) aims to show a different case. This project, as opposed to regular meme plays, is a Layer 2 protocol for Ethereum that goes for speed, scale, and security. Key features include: Built on Ethereum Layer 2: Lightning-fast, ultra-cheap, and secure transactions. Hyper-incentivized staking: Early buyers can earn APYs up to 1,020%. Massive throughput: Transactions per second (TPS) can go up to 10,000 with gas fees being around $0.0001. Token presale starting price of only $0.0053. Retail as well as institutional investors have already pumped more than $2.5 million into the Layer Brett presale. The staking rewards of over 1,000% APY and the swelling community have led to numerous analysts predicting that Layer Brett will be a 40x altcoin in 2025, positioning itself alongside other Layer 2 ecosystems and benefiting from the cultural power of meme-driven adoption. BlockDAG: ambitious project of 2025 BlockDAG (BDAG) is a Layer 1 project merging DAG technology with blockchain to provide the same transactions that would be faster, cheaper, and scalable. It is one of the new altcoins that are expected to have great success, and its hybrid model has attracted the attention of developers for DeFi, NFTs, and dApps. Nonetheless, like most of the best upcoming projects in crypto 2025, BlockDAG has to demonstrate adoption before it can go head-to-head with established Layer 1s. Bitcoin Hyper: Solana speed meets Bitcoin branding Bitcoin Hyper (HYPER) is a Bitcoin Layer 2 project created with the Solana Virtual Machine that promises to deliver fast, secure, and low-cost transactions, along with providing the necessary tools for the creation of DeFi and dApps. Having cross-chain interoperability between Solana and Ethereum, as well as offering high APY staking, makes it one of the new crypto coins to watch. However, the project still has to deal with the intense competition from the top altcoins of 2025 and the inherent dependence on complicated integrations which pose some challenges. Remittix: PayFi network for global commerce Remittix brands itself as the “PayFi” network for cross-border payments, supporting 40+ cryptos, 30+ fiats, and flat fees. Its Pay API positions it as one of the best upcoming crypto projects 2025 with real-world use. The crypto presale 2025 is drawing steady interest, though it needs broader adoption to rival bigger trending crypto presales. While it could drive borderless commerce and appeal to early crypto investment opportunities, Remittix lacks the scale of leaders like MAGACOIN FINANCE. Final thoughts: MAGACOIN FINANCE leads the pack In the whole crypto presales 2025, MAGACOIN FINANCE is leading the way, being the most prominent project. It is attracting both smart money and retail investors by its solid fundamentals, developing price trend, and tempting early-stage bonuses. While the crypto bull run 2025 is gaining steam, the next big altcoin could well be MAGACOIN FINANCE, offering just the right opportunity that investors are looking for. Besides, Layer Brett’s demonstration of meme coins having actual utility makes these two projects the most significant presale leaders to keep an eye on at the moment.

Solana’s price now sits comfortably within the $240 price range and is only 18.05% away from its present all-time high at $294. Interestingly, renowned market expert Ali Martinez has noted a positive effect of SOL’s recent price surge, which points to a sustained price rally. Related Reading: Analyst Sets Bold $1,314 Target For Solana After Cup-And-Handle Breakout SOL Surges Above Key $205 Resistance: Fibonacci Levels Point Toward $362 In an X post on September 13, Martinez shares an in-depth technical analysis of the Solana price structure, which shows significant potential for a prolonged uptrend. Notably, SOL’s price gain from last week resulted in a breakout from a key ascending triangle formation, signaling strong bullish momentum that projects to higher mid-term targets. Looking at the chart below, the latest price surge effectively lifted Solana above the multi-month resistance zone near $205, where price had consolidated between April and August. It is clearly observed that breaking above this resistance, combined with the sustained higher lows that formed the ascending triangle, points to a classic bullish continuation pattern. Notably, the introduction of the Fibonacci extension levels provides more insight into the bullish potential of this recent breakout. The immediate price target presently lies at the 1.272 Fibonacci extension around $250, followed by the 1.414 extension near $277. However, if momentum continues, Solana could reach further upside levels, around $321 (1.618 extension) and the ultimate mid-term target at $362, which corresponds with the 1.786 extension. On the downside, the $205 breakout zone now serves as critical support. Holding above this level is crucial to maintaining the bullish outlook, as a decisive break below it could open the door for a retest of lower Fibonacci retracement zones, particularly around $176 or $156. However, the rising trendline that has supported price action since April adds another layer of structural support for bulls. Related Reading: Bitcoin Flips Key Support, Bulls Now Target $117,000 Solana Price Outlook At the time of writing, Solana is trading at $246, reflecting a modest 1.67% gain over the past 24 hours. However, trading volume has declined sharply by 27.53%, currently standing at $7.49 billion. According to analysts at Coincodex, investor sentiment toward Solana remains broadly bullish, even as the Greed & Fear Index sits at a neutral 52. Their short-term outlook suggests limited price movement, with the asset projected to remain around $247 for the next month. Looking further ahead, analysts expect Solana to climb to $264 over the next three months, highlighting steady but moderate growth expectations. Nevertheless, with a market cap of $131.65 billion, Solana continues to rank as the fifth-largest cryptocurrency in the world.

Short and blunt: Strategy has leaned hard into Bitcoin, and recent numbers make a striking case. Strategy’s Bitcoin Haul And Returns According to posts by Michael Saylor, Strategy now holds about 638,460 BTC following a purchase of 1,955 BTC at an average price near 111,196. The company has spent roughly $47 billion, fees included, to build that stack at an average buy price of $73,880. Based on reports, the current value of those holdings is about $71 billion. Those figures sit at the center of Saylor’s argument that his firm’s balance sheet strategy has paid off in ways typical tech plays have not. Open Interest And Market Cap Comparison Saylor also shared a chart that matched open interest against market capitalization. Strategy topped that metric at 100%, while Tesla registered 26%. The rest of the Magnificent 7 — Nvidia, Meta, Alphabet, Apple, Amazon, and Microsoft — came in well below Strategy’s reading. According to his post, this comparison underpins the claim that Strategy’s market dynamics tied to Bitcoin have outpaced many heavyweight tech names. What’s your Strategy to beat the Magnificent 7? pic.twitter.com/wywaAij3Rs — Michael Saylor (@saylor) September 13, 2025 Magnificent 7 Face Headwinds Based on reports, each of those big tech firms is dealing with different pressures. Apple and Microsoft face tougher regulatory checks. Amazon is seeing slower consumer demand. Tesla must contend with rising competition in electric vehicles. Nvidia remains a strong performer because of AI chip demand, but even Nvidia’s run this year has not matched its earlier explosive gains. Annualized returns presented by Saylor put Strategy at 91%, Nvidia at 72%, Tesla at 32%, Alphabet at 26%, and Meta at 23%. Microsoft, Apple, and Amazon showed significantly lower annualized gains in that comparison. Other Firms Are Buying Bitcoin Too Reports have disclosed that about 12 companies upped their Bitcoin holdings last week, led by Strategy’s 1,955 BTC purchase. Gemini added 1,191 BTC and Bitdeer took on 333.5 BTC. Companies from Japan’s Metaplanet to China’s Cango and the US firm Volcon also added coins. According to BitcoinTreasuries.NET , the 100 largest public holders now control 1,009,202 BTC, which is valued at more than $117 billion today. Bitcoin Could Be The Answer “What’s your Strategy to beat the Magnificent 7?” Saylor asked on X, hinting that Bitcoin—and his company’s bold treasury bet—may offer the answer. Whether investors see it as a challenge or a warning depends on how they weigh Bitcoin exposure against traditional tech growth.

He explained that he had loaned a friend 1,000 XRP when the token was trading at $0.3. Now, with XRP trading close to $3, the friend offered to return $300 instead of the same number of tokens. Bale questioned whether this was fair, arguing that 1000 XRP should be 1000 XRP. The case quickly divided opinions, because the friend considered the dollar value at the time of the loan as the obligation. However, Bale believes that repayment should be made in XRP, regardless of price changes. I loaned a friend 1,000 $XRP wen $XRP was at $0.3 and today he said send me your wallet I’ve got your $300 for you… Im like bruh 1000 xrp = 1000 xrp am I wrong? — BALE (@AltcoinBale) September 14, 2025 XRP Community Weighs In Several community members argued that a loan of XRP should be repaid in XRP, without reference to its dollar value. One commenter stated plainly that 1000 XRP equals 1000 XRP, emphasizing that the quantity of tokens should not change regardless of market conditions. Another confirmed that 1,000 XRP is the correct repayment, aligning with Bale. Others reinforced this point by explaining the nature of the loan. A user clarified that if XRP was loaned, XRP should be returned, just as cash would be repaid in cash. Another stressed that Bale’s friend still owed the full 1,000 tokens, reinforcing the expectation that repayment should match the asset loaned. This perspective leans on the belief shared by many token holders that XRP will play a crucial role in global payments . Experts have advocated that investors hold on to their tokens and lend them to institutions and banks . Other commenters also faulted Bale’s decision to loan XRP to a friend, as this would yield nothing, and he could also lose profits as the friend now intends to repay $300 instead of 1,000 XRP. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Should Bale Accept $300? On the other side, some argued that the loan should be viewed in terms of its fiat value at the time of transfer. A commenter pointed out that the friend asked for money, not XRP. So $300 should cover the loan. However, one user criticized the approach of repaying less in current value, noting that it undermined trust. Taking advice from other experts and refusing to sell those tokens would have turned that $300 investment into $3,000. For many, the principle that 1,000 XRP should be repaid as 1,000 XRP remains the most straightforward approach. Some analysts have projected long-term price targets reaching as high as $10,000 , meaning that holders who part with their XRP without clear agreements risk substantial losses if repayment is tied only to past fiat values.

This move marks a significant bullish signal, though a temporary pullback to the broken level remains a likely scenario. Ripple Price Analysis By Shayan The Daily Chart On the daily timeframe, XRP benefited from intense buying pressure, with support provided by the 100-day moving average and the wedge’s lower boundary near $2.7. This confluence fueled a fresh spike, culminating in a breakout above the falling wedge’s upper boundary, a clear sign of a bullish market structure shift. Despite this breakout, the asset is likely to undergo a short period of consolidation or corrective pullback, with the broken level at $2.9 serving as a probable retest zone. If this level holds, Ripple’s next upside targets remain the critical $3.4 and $3.6 resistance thresholds. The 4-Hour Chart The 4-hour chart further emphasizes the impulsive breakout from the multi-month wedge pattern, reflecting strong buyer dominance. The rally has already pushed the price into the $3 supply zone, where initial rejection suggests active sell-side liquidity. If buyers manage to reclaim and hold above $3, momentum could carry Ripple toward the $3.4 resistance. Conversely, a rejection here would likely trigger a correctional pullback toward the broken wedge trendline, where demand is expected to be tested.

Speaking in a recent interview with Kyle Chassé, a longtime bitcoin and Web3 entrepreneur, the BitMEX co-founder and current Maelstrom CIO argued that governments around the world are far from finished with aggressive monetary expansion. He pointed to U.S. politics in particular, saying that President Donald Trump’s second term has not yet fully unleashed the spending programs that could arrive from mid-2026 onward. Hayes suggested that if expectations for money printing become extreme, he may consider taking partial profits, but for now he sees investors underestimating the scale of liquidity that could flow into equities and crypto. Hayes tied his outlook to broader geopolitical shifts, including what he described as the erosion of a unipolar world order. In his view, such periods of instability tend to push policymakers toward fiscal stimulus and central bank easing as tools to keep citizens and markets calm. He also raised the possibility of strains within Europe — even hinting that a French default could destabilize the euro — as another factor likely to accelerate global printing presses. While he acknowledged these policies eventually risk ending badly, he argued that the blow-off top of the cycle is still ahead. Turning to bitcoin, Hayes pushed back on concerns that the asset has stalled after reaching a record $124,000 in mid-August. He contrasted its performance with other asset classes, noting that while U.S. stocks are higher in dollar terms, they have not fully recovered relative to gold since the 2008 financial crisis. Hayes pointed out that real estate also lags when measured against gold, and only a handful of U.S. technology giants have consistently outperformed. When measured against bitcoin, however, he believes all traditional benchmarks appear weak. Hayes’ message was that bitcoin’s dominance becomes even clearer once assets are viewed through the lens of currency debasement. For those frustrated that bitcoin is not posting fresh highs every week, Hayes suggested that expectations are misplaced. In his telling, investors from the traditional world and those in crypto actually share the same premise: governments and central banks will print money whenever growth falters. Hayes says traditional finance tends to express this view by buying bonds on leverage, while crypto investors hold bitcoin as the “faster horse.” His conclusion is that patience is essential. Hayes argued that the real edge of holding bitcoin comes from years of compounding outperformance rather than short-term speculation. Coupled with what he sees as an inevitable wave of money creation through the rest of the decade, he believes the present crypto cycle could stretch well into 2026, far from exhausted.",Markets|Bitcoin|Crypto|Money Printing|News,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|MACROECONOMICS|BTC|MARKET|BUSINESS,"{'name': 'CoinDesk', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/5/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coindesk,2025-09-14 17:10:47

While momentum remains bullish, traders should remain mindful of potential pullbacks into key support zones before continuation higher. Technical Analysis By Shayan The Daily Chart On the daily timeframe, BTC recently staged a strong rebound from the highlighted order block (demand zone), underscoring that buyers remain firmly in control at this critical level. The bounce was further validated by a clean breakout above the 100-day moving average, which had previously acted as dynamic resistance. This development signals a return of bullish momentum, though a short-term pullback into the broken MA near $112K cannot be ruled out. If this retest holds, the broader structure would remain supportive of continuation toward the all-time high resistance zone. The 4-Hour Chart On the 4-hour chart, a clear Change of Character (CHOCH) has occurred, confirming a decisive shift from bearish to bullish structure. After breaking above prior swing highs, Bitcoin is now consolidating just beneath the $117K resistance region. The green decision point zone at $112K remains a key level to monitor. A retracement into this order block would not undermine the bullish outlook; instead, it could provide a healthy correction before the next leg upward. Sustaining above this base keeps the path open toward ATH retests. On-chain Analysis By Shayan The transfer of BTC from miner wallets to exchanges has historically acted as a barometer of supply-side pressure. Peaks in miner-to-exchange flows have often coincided with market tops, as increased distribution added selling pressure. Currently, the 30-day moving average of Miner-to-Exchange Flow has declined to its lowest levels in the short term. This drop suggests that miners are reducing distribution, and possibly accumulating Bitcoin instead. Interestingly, this trend aligns with Bitcoin’s latest surge above $115K, reinforcing a signal of bullish sentiment from miners. In short, the combination of a technical structure shift and miner accumulation provides a constructive outlook. As long as $112K holds, Bitcoin appears well-positioned to sustain momentum and mount another challenge toward its all-time highs.

At the Goldman Sachs Communacopia event on Tuesday, co-founder and CEO Michael Intrator said the market is still growing faster than anyone can handle. “The depth of the demand, the scale of the demand, the breadth of the demand is overwhelming,” Michael said. “The industry’s capacity to deliver the compute that is required by OpenAI, by the hyperscalers, by the enterprise, by the sovereigns–it’s just layer after layer of overwhelming demand.” Michael said the company is scaling operations aggressively. “We’re building as fast as we can, we’re building as large as we can. We’re delivering as many GPUs as we can,” he said. “We’re driving through the middle to try and get this infrastructure into the hands of these incredible companies that really have the capacity to allow artificial intelligence to achieve its potential.” Despite this demand, CoreWeave’s stock has dropped 20% over the past month. This comes after one of the most hyped IPOs of 2025. The company posted a second-quarter net loss that was worse than expected. On top of that, capital expenditures shot up by $1 billion from the previous quarter. And those expenses are expected to rise another $500 million this quarter. That has raised concerns that the company’s debt could climb even higher. CoreWeave’s losses mount as spending grows With the IPO lockup expiring in mid-August, insiders began selling off shares. Investors are still questioning how much more debt CoreWeave can take on. Analysts project the company might raise billions more in debt before the year is over. Michael doesn’t seem worried. He believes borrowing is the best way to fund the company’s growth. But not everyone agrees. JPMorgan analyst Mark Murphy said, “Net-net, there could be a wide range of outcomes for CoreWeave. For this reason, we expect the stock to provide a wild, lumpy, volatile ride, requiring a risk tolerance that may not exist for most investors.” Mark also warned that if the economy weakens, CoreWeave could be hit harder than most because of its debt exposure. He believes the market is only focusing on the negative side right now. UBS targets Alibaba and Tencent in China’s AI race While CoreWeave is racing to meet demand in the U.S., UBS is tracking where China’s AI growth is heading. In a report released earlier this month, Eva Lee and her team at UBS said Chinese companies that moved early on generative AI are starting to pull away from the pack. Eva wrote, “We favor AI-driven and alpha growth names with strong execution.” Based on second-quarter earnings, UBS is backing Alibaba and Tencent. Alibaba’s stock in the U.S. is up 83% so far in 2025. Tencent’s shares in Hong Kong have gained over 54%. That performance beats other Chinese tech players like Baidu, which is up 36%, JD.com, which is down 3%, and Meituan, which is down over 36% in Hong Kong this year. UBS called Alibaba the “largest AI enabler in China with full-stack AI cloud infrastructure.” For Tencent, the edge is in AI-powered gaming and advertising, with potential future profits coming from AI agents. Eva’s team said, “In the past quarter, we observed that China internet companies have reaped tangible AI benefits.” They highlighted that company earnings and leadership outlooks have both improved, especially in ads and games. The report also looked at U.S. chip restrictions and found they haven’t slowed down China’s top players. “Chip restrictions have not emerged as a major concern,” UBS said. The companies say they’ve got enough chips for AI training, and they’ve been improving software to get better performance out of what they already have. Eva and her analysts also said Alibaba and Tencent are reducing their reliance on imported chips by switching to other options for inference. And they’re spending more to stay ahead. In Q2, Tencent doubled its AI-related capital expenses year-over-year to 19.1 billion yuan. Alibaba increased its AI spending by over 50% compared to its average from the past four quarters. Still, both companies have other priorities outside AI. Alibaba has been throwing heavy subsidies into instant delivery to compete with JD.com and Meituan. Meanwhile, Tencent is still dealing with uncertainty from China’s gaming regulators, even though rules have eased slightly since the last crackdown. Get seen where it counts.

Karen Hao, a sharp journalistic voice, recently peeled back the layers of what she terms the AI Empire , offering a sobering look at the true cost of belief in artificial general intelligence (AGI) and the leading role of entities like OpenAI. For those of us who value transparency and decentralized power, Hao’s insights provide a vital counter-narrative to the prevailing techno-optimism. Unmasking the AI Empire’s Ideology Every empire, whether ancient or modern, is built upon a foundational ideology. Just as European colonial powers justified their expansion with religious fervor, today’s burgeoning AI Empire , as meticulously documented by Karen Hao in her bestselling book, is propelled by the fervent belief in artificial general intelligence (AGI). This ideology, promising to “benefit all humanity,” serves as the driving force behind unprecedented resource extraction and rapid expansion, often at a cost that directly contradicts its lofty mission. Hao, in an interview with Bitcoin World’s Equity, powerfully likens the industry, and particularly OpenAI, to an empire, noting, “The only way to really understand the scope and scale of OpenAI’s behavior…is actually to recognize that they’ve already grown more powerful than pretty much any nation state in the world… They’re terraforming the Earth. They’re rewiring our geopolitics, all of our lives. And so you can only describe it as an empire.” This perspective challenges us to look beyond the shiny interfaces and consider the foundational structures of power being erected. The Zeal of AGI Evangelism and its True Cost The fervor surrounding AGI evangelism is palpable within the AI industry. Karen Hao recounted interviewing individuals whose “voices were shaking from the fervor of their beliefs in AGI.” OpenAI, positioned as the chief evangelist, defines AGI as “a highly autonomous system that outperforms humans at most economically valuable work.” The promise is grand: AGI will “elevate humanity by increasing abundance, turbocharging the economy, and aiding in the discovery of new scientific knowledge that changes the limits of possibility.” Yet, these nebulous assurances have fueled an exponential growth model with staggering demands: Massive Resource Demands: Oceans of scraped data, straining existing infrastructure. Energy Grid Overload: Significant energy consumption contributing to environmental concerns. Untested System Releases: A willingness to deploy systems with unknown long-term consequences into the world. All of this is in service of a future that many experts caution may never fully materialize, raising critical questions about the true cost of this unwavering belief. OpenAI’s Pursuit of Speed Over Safety According to Hao, the current trajectory of AI development, heavily influenced by OpenAI’s pursuit , was not inevitable. She argues that advancements aren’t solely dependent on scaling up; alternative methods exist, such as developing new algorithms or improving existing ones to reduce data and compute requirements. However, such tactics would sacrifice speed, a commodity OpenAI deemed paramount. “When you define the quest to build beneficial AGI as one where the victor takes all — which is what OpenAI did — then the most important thing is speed over anything else,” Hao explained. This singular focus on speed has come at the expense of: Efficiency: Opting for brute force over elegant solutions. Safety: Rushing development without adequate testing or safeguards. Exploratory Research: Prioritizing immediate deployment over deeper scientific inquiry. OpenAI, Hao contends, chose the “intellectually cheap thing” – pumping more data and supercomputers into existing techniques. This set a precedent, compelling other tech giants to follow suit to avoid falling behind. The consequence? The industry has effectively “captured most of the top AI researchers in the world,” shifting the entire discipline’s agenda from genuine scientific exploration to corporate objectives. The Mounting AI Industry Costs and Unseen Harms The financial investment within the AI industry costs are nothing short of astronomical. OpenAI projects burning through $115 billion by 2029. Meta allocated up to $72 billion for AI infrastructure this year, while Google expects to hit $85 billion in capital expenditures for 2025, largely for AI and cloud expansion. Despite these colossal expenditures, the promised “benefits to humanity” remain largely elusive, while tangible harms continue to accumulate. These include: Job Displacement: Automation leading to significant job losses across various sectors. Concentration of Wealth: Further consolidating economic power in the hands of a few tech giants. Mental Health Crises: AI chatbots fueling delusions and psychosis, as documented by Hao. Exploitation of Labor: Workers in developing nations, like Kenya and Venezuela, exposed to disturbing content (e.g., child sexual abuse material) for meager wages ($1-$2 an hour) in roles like content moderation and data labeling. Hao critically observes that the goalposts for AGI’s benefits keep shifting, while the immediate, undeniable harms continue to mount, painting a stark picture of the real-world impact of this technological race. A Balanced Future for AI: Beyond the Empire Hao stresses that pitting AI progress against present harms is a false dichotomy, especially when alternative forms of AI offer genuine, tangible benefits without the accompanying destruction. She highlights Google DeepMind’s Nobel Prize-winning AlphaFold as a prime example. Trained on amino acid sequence data and complex protein folding structures, AlphaFold can accurately predict protein 3D structures, profoundly aiding drug discovery and disease understanding. “Those are the types of AI systems that we need,” Hao asserted, emphasizing AlphaFold’s minimal environmental impact and lack of content moderation harms, thanks to its substantially smaller, cleaner datasets. This offers a glimpse into a more responsible future of AI . Furthermore, the narrative of racing against China to ensure Silicon Valley’s liberalizing effect on the world has, according to Hao, backfired. “Literally, the opposite has happened,” she states, noting that the gap between the U.S. and China has narrowed, and Silicon Valley has exerted an “illiberalizing effect” globally, with itself being the primary beneficiary. The complex structure of OpenAI – part non-profit, part for-profit – further complicates its mission of “benefiting humanity.” The recent agreement with Microsoft, bringing it closer to a public offering, blurs these lines even more. Former OpenAI safety researchers, echoing Hao’s concerns, fear the organization is confusing product enjoyment with genuine societal benefit. Hao warns of the profound danger of being so consumed by a self-constructed belief system that reality, and the accumulating evidence of harm, is ignored. Karen Hao’s “Empire of AI” offers a crucial, critical lens through which to view the rapid expansion of artificial intelligence, particularly the fervent pursuit of AGI by companies like OpenAI. Her work illuminates the hidden costs – environmental, social, and ethical – of an ideology that prioritizes speed and expansion above all else. As the industry continues its exponential growth, driven by astronomical investments and a quasi-religious commitment to AGI, it becomes imperative for us to question the narratives, scrutinize the impacts, and demand a more responsible, human-centric approach to AI development. The future of technology, and indeed humanity, hinges on our ability to distinguish genuine progress from unchecked imperial ambition.

While market leaders like XRP continue to hold firm in the spotlight, attention is next turning to fresh DeFi front-runners like Mutuum Finance (MUTM) . Positioned at the intersection of decentralized lending, Mutuum Finance is taking center stage for its creative approach to liquidity and capital efficiency, areas that can set it alongside the altcoin adoption wave leaders of the future. As sentiment lifts across coins, interest around which altcoins to watch develops, and MUTM is a name that keeps popping up. XRP Price Outlook XRP is currently trading at $3.03, reflecting newfound energy after reclaiming the $3 level amid growing institutional inflows. Analysts note that if the token is able to remain supported above $2.90, it could attempt to make a push toward the $3.30–$3.50 region in the near term, though resistance at these points is constricted. While such momentum is a credit to XRP’s position in recent market recovery, attention in the broader crypto market is also shifting toward newer DeFi projects such as Mutuum Finance. Increasing Momentum in the Presale of Mutuum Finance Mutuum Finance has already created significant traction in its current presale, with over 16,280 investors and more than $15.68 million raised as of now. Currently at Phase 6, tokens can be had for $0.035 each, with the price being raised to $0.06 upon launch. This tiered, structured price model embodies the project’s incentive system, where early adopters are rewarded with maximum benefits for their early adoption. Launch of a Dual Lending Model Another prominent feature of the project is its dual lending model, which brings Peer-to-Contract and Peer-to-Peer models together in a single environment. According to the Peer-to-Contract model, liquidity pools are controlled by smart contracts alone, and interest rates are adjusted automatically by supply and demand levels. The Peer-to-Peer alternative, however, allows borrowers and lenders to negotiate among themselves, either through the fixity or variability of interest rates. Both schemes are facilitated by way of smart contracts, allowing for an open and trustless process. For added assurance of reliability, the platform itself has already undergone thorough auditing, with its codebase being made available as open-source so that maximum transparency and security are assured. Roadmap for Growth and Community Incentives Mutuum Finance’s future strategy lies in long-term growth through staking reward potential, token buyback programs, and strategically made exchange listings, all designed to increase liquidity and strengthen real-world applications. In addition to this, the project is also rewarding early adoption through a $100,000 giveaway . The campaign provides several different entry options throughout presale, encouraging strong community participation. Stablecoin Growth with Security and Reliability As part of its broader ecosystem growth, Mutuum Finance is preparing to issue a USD-backed stablecoin on the Ethereum network. In contrast to algorithmic stablecoins, which have frequently failed during episodes of market volatility, Mutuum’s stablecoin will be overcollateralized and non-algorithmic, and thus capable of maintaining its peg even during episodes of financial stress. The model relies on the deployment of unused collateral reserves, ensuring long-term stability alongside value preservation guarantees. This positions the stablecoin not just as a secure medium of exchange but also as a secure store of value in the Mutuum Finance platform. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is quickly shaping up to be one of the top altcoins discussed as bullish sentiment creeps back into the market. More than $15.68M raised, 16,280+ investors registered, and Stage 6 tokens that cost $0.035 prior to the final launch price of $0.06, early bird investors are in for big upside. As XRP gains around $3.03, analysts see MUTM as the best DeFi play for investors seeking more growth potential. Become part of Stage 6 today and receive your tokens before the price goes up.

The question isn’t whether SOL can dethrone Ethereum, but whether both will face disruption from next-generation solutions that combine meme culture with superior Layer 2 technology. Layer Brett’s presale has already raised over $3.5 million , offering early investors the chance to stake $LBRETT tokens at an extraordinary 700+% APY while positioning for potential 100x gains. Technical barriers limit Solana price prediction upside despite institutional momentum Recent Solana price prediction models paint an optimistic picture, with some analysts projecting SOL could reach $1,314 following current breakout patterns. Galaxy Digital’s massive $700 million accumulation demonstrates institutional confidence, while SOL trades near $240 with consistent 5-6% gains. However, these bullish signals mask fundamental limitations that constrain long-term growth potential. SOL’s network congestion issues during high-demand periods expose scalability challenges that institutional adoption will only amplify. While Galaxy’s CEO calls Solana “tailor-made” for financial markets, the reality is that even optimistic Solana price prediction scenarios struggle to account for the technical debt accumulating as transaction volume increases. Ethereum’s established dominance creates an insurmountable competitive moat The Ethereum ecosystem’s entrenchment presents SOL with a challenge that transcends mere technical specifications. Despite Solana’s speed advantages, Ethereum’s developer ecosystem, institutional partnerships, and protocol maturity create switching costs that even the most bullish Solana price prediction cannot overcome through price appreciation alone. Forward Industries’ $1.65 billion raise supporting Galaxy’s SOL accumulation reflects confidence in Solana’s current trajectory, but institutional money follows infrastructure stability over revolutionary potential. Layer Brett recognizes this dynamic by building on Ethereum’s foundation while delivering the speed and cost advantages that make SOL attractive to traders seeking alternatives. Layer Brett combines proven infrastructure with exponential opportunity While SOL and Ethereum compete for market share in an increasingly saturated Layer 1 landscape, Layer Brett represents the next evolutionary step: a Layer 2 blockchain that inherits Ethereum’s security while delivering transaction speeds that surpass Solana’s capabilities. The project’s unique positioning as both a memecoin and serious infrastructure play creates asymmetric upside that traditional Solana price prediction models cannot match. Early $LBRETT investors can stake tokens immediately at 700+% APY, generating passive income while participating in Layer Brett’s ecosystem development. Where SOL targets institutions and Ethereum brings complexity, Layer Brett merges grassroots meme culture with real Layer 2 functionality—producing viral momentum that legacy networks find impossible to recreate. Through its $1 million giveaway campaign, Layer Brett further showcases dedication to fostering community bonds, and by maintaining a decentralized structure with zero KYC requirements, it delivers the accessibility that corporate-minded platforms like SOL simply can’t match. Infrastructure plays offer the strongest chance this year The Solana price prediction debate ultimately misses the larger narrative: the future belongs to Layer 2 solutions that solve scalability without sacrificing security or decentralization. While SOL may achieve short-term price targets, Layer Brett’s combination of Ethereum security, superior speed, and community-driven growth creates the mathematical foundation for sustained exponential returns. Smart money is gravitating toward presale opportunities that offer both immediate staking rewards and long-term infrastructure positioning before mainstream adoption makes early entry impossible.

51722257,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=808367,1757871622,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/51722257.jpeg,"Traders see no major volatility spike, even as $5 trillion in triple-witching options expire Friday",https://www.cryptopolitan.com/5t-triple-witching-and-fed-decision-collide/,"Markets are staring down a week packed with chaos triggers, but traders aren’t twitching. A $5 trillion triple-witching options expiry lands on Friday, just two days after the Federal Reserve is expected to cut interest rates. And yet, no one is betting on a volatility surge, not yet. That’s straight from a Bloomberg report that broke this story wide open. The Fed, under Jerome Powell, is widely expected to cut rates by 25 basis points on Wednesday. That move is already priced in. What’s not priced in is Powell’s tone during the press conference. Traders aren’t waiting for the cut; they’re watching for clues on how deep and how fast rate cuts could come next. The focus now moves to the labor market, with key data coming in over the next few weeks that could push Powell’s hand. Volatility stays low as eyes turn to jobs and Powell’s tone Options traders are positioning for small swings. Citigroup sees just a 0.72% move expected for Wednesday’s Fed meeting and a 0.78% move around the October 3 nonfarm payrolls report. That’s tame for a week when most dealers are usually on edge. Stuart Kaiser, who runs U.S. equity-trading strategy at Citi, said the real jolt will come if the employment data collapses. “If you threw up a minus 50k payrolls next month, you’re gonna get vol higher,” Stuart said . “You probably need the unemployment rate to be around 4.5%.” Last week’s jobless claims already flashed warning signs. Initial claims hit the highest level in nearly four years, setting off alarms across trading desks. That spike came just days after a sweeping jobs revision showed the U.S. had 911,000 fewer jobs than originally reported between April 2024 and March 2025. The slowdown is real, but not a full crash… yet. “We’re not getting this hard landing like collapse in the job market,” said Lakshman Achuthan, co-founder of the Economic Cycle Research Institute. “This could get rough at some point … but it’s not yet.” Despite those cracks, the FedWatch tool from CME shows that traders are now pricing in a 76% chance of three rate cuts before the year ends. That’s a big jump from just a few weeks ago, as more traders brace for aggressive easing. But some are warning not to get too excited. Garrett DeSimone, who runs quant research at OptionMetrics, said past emergency cuts often fool traders. “History shows that during emergency cuts in particular, intraday market returns are usually positive, but medium-term returns often turn negative,” Garrett said. In other words, the first sugar rush might fade fast. Triple-witching expiration loses its punch as volatility stays low Friday’s triple-witching expiration isn’t getting the hype it used to. Traders once feared the collision of expiring stock options, index futures, and ETF contracts. That totaled $5 trillion in quarterly expiry this time, but Garrett said the effect has been fading. “The quarterly option expiry is increasingly becoming a non-event especially when volatility is low,” Garrett said. And volatility is definitely low. Historical data over the last 35 years shows that S&P 500 intraday moves during expiry weeks are only slightly higher than the following weeks. That puts a dent in the “free to move” theory, where dealers’ positions roll off and remove their usual stabilizing trades. That theory, that dealers buy dips and sell rallies to balance their books, and that their exit lets prices swing, isn’t showing up when volatility’s crushed, Garrett said. So traders shouldn’t expect Monday to be wild. It might feel like any other quiet week, despite the size of the contracts rolling off. Meanwhile, the broader equity market is ignoring the noise and pushing higher. The Nasdaq broke 22,000 this week, clocking in its fifth straight record close. The S&P 500 crossed another milestone, pushing beyond 4,600, and the Dow Jones Industrial Average hit a record too; 46,000, its highest level ever. Even with signs of economic stress, tech stocks are still moving markets. Oracle’s AI backlog numbers stunned traders, and strategists like Ulrike Hoffmann-Burchardi from UBS say the AI rally isn’t slowing down. “With robust tech earnings momentum and imminent Fed rate cuts ahead, we do not see elevated valuations as a reason to shy away from diversified exposure to the sector,” Ulrike said. She added that UBS sees the S&P 500 hitting 6,600 by the end of 2025, and 6,800 by mid-2026. That’s the most bullish call from UBS so far this year, even with rising rate-cut bets and a weakening labor market. Get seen where it counts.

Still, attention is shifting fast as XYZVerse enters its presale phase, boasting impressive growth potential. With new trends and unexpected frontrunners emerging, the spotlight is now shared in an increasingly competitive digital asset market. What is drawing investors to these choices? Price Prediction for XYZVerse ($XYZ): Is a 30x Jump Possible? XYZVerse has entered the meme coin market at a time when community-driven tokens continue to dominate speculative trading. The rise of meme coins like PEPE , Dogwifhat , and Bonk proves that strong branding, viral marketing, and community engagement can drive massive gains. The broader market sentiment also plays a key role in XYZVerse’s potential. As the altcoin season is about to start, lower-cap meme coins are seeing increased investor interest. Given that XYZVerse is still in presale, it could benefit from this wave if it secures strategic exchange listings and maintains community hype post-launch. Key Strengths of XYZVerse in the Current Market: Strong branding with sports and influencer partnerships, broadening its appeal Deflationary mechanics (17.13% token burn) to reduce supply pressure Liquidity allocation (15%) to support stability after launch Community incentives (10%) fostering engagement and holding Price Prediction for $XYZ Current Presale Price: $0.005 Projected Post-Presale Target: $0.10 (as per project’s estimates) Potential ATH (First 1-2 Weeks Post-Launch): $0.15 – $0.25 (if demand surges and listings drive FOMO) Long-Term Potential (6-12 Months): $0.20 – $0.40 (if the project secures major partnerships and listings) Buy $XYZ Early for Maximum Gains Realistic Expectations: Will XYZ Hit $0.10? A 30x jump from presale to $0.10 is possible but depends on: Strong Exchange Listings – If XYZVerse lands on major CEX platforms like KuCoin, OKX, or Binance, its price could skyrocket on launch day. Sustained Community Growth – Meme coins need viral momentum. If XYZVerse delivers on its sports influencer partnerships, it could drive massive social media engagement. Market Conditions – If Bitcoin and altcoins remain bullish, speculation-driven assets like XYZVerse tend to benefit. Is a 3000% Surge Possible for $XYZ? XYZVerse has the ingredients for a strong launch, but its long-term success depends on execution. If the team delivers strong marketing, high-profile listings, and real community engagement, the $0.10+ target, which is around 3000% from the current price, could be achievable. Invest in $XYZ Before It Surges SOL: The Fast Lane Coin Catching Eyes This Market Season Solana is a busy digital highway built for speed. It handles many trades in a flash, while coins like Ethereum and Cardano often slow down in traffic. The secret is its smart design, which moves data in one chain instead of breaking it into tiny parts. Coders can build apps in several common languages, so fresh ideas arrive daily. At the heart of it all is SOL, the fuel that pays for every action and thanks the people who keep the network alive. Some traders say the current market cycle feels like early spring. Prices rise, pull back, then push again. In this climate, coins with clear use can shine. SOL fits that story. Its fast lanes invite gaming, finance, and art apps that need quick moves. If users flock to these projects, demand for SOL may grow, just as gas rises when more cars hit the road. Critics worry about past outages, yet upgrades aim to cut such stops. Compared with slower but safer rivals, Solana offers a bold, high-speed ride. For those who believe the next wave of apps needs speed, SOL looks tempting, but only time will tell who wins the race. Conclusion Both appear strong: SOL rallies convincingly, yet XYZVerse shines as the first all-sport memecoin, merging meme hype with global sports, targeting 20,000% gains via community GameFi and key media partnerships.

In a detailed YouTube video , he explained that XRP was not designed for retail speculation but rather as the backbone of the infrastructure for a tokenized global economy. He noted that the “circulating supply of XRP is actually far smaller than most people think once you remove escrow and institutional holdings,” stressing that once tokenized debt, gold, and stablecoins require liquidity, available supply could collapse overnight. Aljarrah emphasized that XRP was created to solve the inefficiencies of traditional finance, which is burdened by insolvencies, outdated settlement systems, and rising global debt. He described XRP as “the plumbing of the new financial system,” highlighting that it was designed for scalability and to handle institutional-level settlement demands. According to him, this is what sets it apart from other digital assets that serve smaller or more niche functions. The circulating supply of XRP is actually far smaller than most people think once you remove escrow and institutional holdings. Once demand from tokenized debt, gold, and stablecoins hits XRP, circulating supply could collapse overnight. https://t.co/f5Kzuh8IGl — Black Swan Capitalist (@VersanAljarrah) September 14, 2025 The Push Toward Tokenization Aljarrah focused on Ripple’s ongoing work to establish RippleNet as the backbone for institutional connectivity. He noted that XRP is the asset providing settlement and liquidity within that system, giving it direct utility in cross-border payments and interoperability between digital and traditional assets. He argued that XRP is not only a tool for moving value but also a foundation for bridging financial systems worldwide, including economies moving toward real-world asset (RWA) tokenization . This role extends to central banks, where Aljarrah linked the Bank for International Settlements’ Basel III framework with the rise of digital assets. While Basel III emphasizes gold reserves, he said the future rests with tokenized assets. In his view, XRP is positioned to serve as the liquidity layer that supports tokenized gold, bonds, and debt, offering central banks a practical way to stabilize and restructure their economies.

With each transaction burning a fraction of the asset, he argued that scarcity will intensify over time, making higher valuations necessary once institutional adoption expands. He pointed to past estimates projecting XRP at $10,000 or more, stressing that such figures stem from its intended utility, not speculation. Aljarrah further noted that XRP is already positioning itself as a “digital reserve currency and settlement mechanism.” He said its role complements XLM in a dual system serving institutions and private use, with Ripple’s growing partnerships reinforcing XRP’s central place in the financial transition.
