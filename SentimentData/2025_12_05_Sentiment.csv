In its report titled “Understanding Stablecoins,” the IMF reviewed how major economies, including the United States, the United Kingdom, the European Union, and Japan, regulate stablecoins and found that national approaches remain widely inconsistent. Stablecoins have the potential to reshape cross-border payments and capital flows. They offer opportunities, but also bring new risks—financial integrity, regulatory oversight, consumer protection, capital flow management, monetary sovereignty, and more.

Stablecoins Are Moving Faster Than Regulators Can Track, IMF Warns The IMF said this regulatory patchwork allows stablecoins to move across borders faster than oversight can follow. Issuers can operate from lightly regulated jurisdictions while serving users in stricter markets, limiting authorities’ ability to monitor reserves, redemptions, liquidity management, and anti-money laundering controls. The fund warned that this creates regulatory arbitrage and weakens global supervision. The report also pointed to technical fragmentation. Stablecoins increasingly operate across different blockchains and exchanges that are not always interoperable. According to the IMF, this lack of coordination raises transaction costs, slows market development, and creates barriers to efficient global payments. Differences in national regulatory treatment further complicate cross-border usage and settlement. Source: IMF Stablecoins remain dominated by U.S. dollar-denominated tokens. The IMF said the global stablecoin market is now worth more than $300 billion. Tether’s USDT and Circle’s USDC make up the majority of that supply. About 40% of USDC’s reserves are held in short-term U.S. treasuries, while roughly 75% of USDT’s reserves are in short-term treasuries, with another 5% held in Bitcoin. The concentration of reserves in government debt markets links stablecoins directly to traditional financial systems Widespread use of foreign-currency stablecoins can weaken domestic monetary control, lower demand for local currency, and accelerate digital dollarization. Stablecoins also make it easier to bypass capital controls through unhosted wallets and offshore platforms. In addition to monetary concerns, the fund cited broader financial stability concerns. Large-scale redemptions could force rapid sales of Treasury bills and repo assets, potentially disrupting short-term funding markets that are critical for monetary policy transmission. The IMF also noted that the increasing interconnection between stablecoin issuers, banks, custodians, crypto exchanges, and funds also increases the risk of contagion spreading from digital markets into the wider financial system. IMF Urges Unified Stablecoin Regulation as Cross-Border Risks Grow To address these risks, the IMF released new global policy guidelines intended to reduce fragmentation. It called for harmonized definitions of stablecoins, consistent rules for reserve assets, and shared cross-border monitoring frameworks. The fund said issuers should be subject to the principle of “same activity, same risk, same regulation,” regardless of whether the issuer is a bank, fintech company, or crypto platform. The IMF also said stablecoins should be backed only by high-quality liquid assets such as short-term government securities, with strict limits on risky holdings. Issuers must guarantee full one-to-one redemption at par, on demand, at all times. Strong international coordination on anti-money laundering enforcement, licensing, and supervision of large global stablecoin arrangements was also included in the new guidance. The IMF’s warning comes as regulatory pressure is rising worldwide. In Europe, the European Central Bank recently warned that stablecoins, despite their small footprint in the euro area, now pose spillover risks due to their growing ties to U.S. Treasury markets. The ECB warns that stablecoins are growing fast, now topping $280B, with rising spillover risks as USDT and USDC dominate 90% of the market. #Stablecoins #ECB https://t.co/ef16HZzqYL — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) November 24, 2025 The European Systemic Risk Board has also called for urgent safeguards against cross-border stablecoin structures operating under the EU’s MiCA framework. In China, the central bank has described stablecoins as a threat to financial stability and monetary sovereignty, while the Bank of England and Basel regulators are reassessing how banks should hold capital against stablecoin exposure as usage expands. The IMF concluded that without consistent global regulation, stablecoins could bypass national safeguards, destabilize vulnerable economies, and transmit financial shocks across borders at high speed.

The Nasdaq-listed Digital Asset Treasury firm for the TON token has filed to raise a staggering $420.7 million. This AlphaTON securities filing represents more than just capital—it’s a strategic bet on the convergence of artificial intelligence and blockchain technology. Let’s explore what this means for investors, the TON ecosystem, and the broader crypto landscape. What Does the AlphaTON Securities Filing Actually Mean? AlphaTON recently submitted a Form S-3 shelf registration with U.S. financial authorities. This regulatory filing allows the company to issue up to $420.69 million in securities over time. Think of it as getting pre-approval for fundraising—the company can now tap into capital markets when conditions are favorable without starting from scratch each time. The timing is particularly interesting. As traditional finance shows increasing interest in digital assets, AlphaTON’s move positions it at the intersection of regulated securities and innovative blockchain technology. The company plans to use these funds for several strategic initiatives that could reshape its role in the crypto ecosystem. Where Will the $420.7 Million Actually Go? AlphaTON has outlined clear priorities for the substantial capital it seeks to raise. The allocation strategy reveals much about where the company sees the greatest opportunities for growth and innovation. The primary focus will be expanding AI and high-performance computing infrastructure. Specifically, this expansion will support Telegram’s Cocoon AI network—an ambitious project that could revolutionize how users interact with artificial intelligence through the popular messaging platform. Beyond AI infrastructure, the funds will support: TON token acquisition and related digital assets Strategic investments in TON ecosystem startups General corporate purposes and operational expansion This diversified approach shows AlphaTON isn’t putting all its eggs in one basket. Instead, the company is building a comprehensive strategy that strengthens multiple aspects of its business simultaneously. Why This AlphaTON Securities Move Matters for Crypto Investors The significance of this AlphaTON securities filing extends far beyond the company itself. It represents several important trends in the evolving relationship between traditional finance and cryptocurrency. First, it demonstrates that established companies can successfully navigate regulatory requirements while operating in the digital asset space. AlphaTON’s Nasdaq listing already provided legitimacy, but this securities filing shows the company can work within traditional financial frameworks while focusing on innovative technologies. Second, the specific focus on AI infrastructure highlights how blockchain companies are expanding beyond their original mandates. AlphaTON started as a Digital Asset Treasury firm but now positions itself at the intersection of multiple cutting-edge technologies. Finally, the substantial investment planned for the TON ecosystem signals strong confidence in Telegram’s blockchain ambitions. As one of the most widely used messaging platforms globally, Telegram’s integration with blockchain through TON creates unique opportunities for mass adoption. What Challenges Could AlphaTON Face? While the AlphaTON securities filing represents an ambitious vision, the company will need to navigate several potential challenges. Regulatory scrutiny will likely intensify as the company raises and deploys such substantial capital. U.S. financial authorities pay close attention to crypto-related securities offerings, particularly when they involve substantial sums. Market conditions present another consideration. The success of any securities offering depends on investor appetite, which can fluctuate with broader economic trends and crypto market sentiment. AlphaTON’s shelf registration provides flexibility, but ultimately the company must issue securities when market conditions are favorable. Execution risk represents the final major challenge. Successfully deploying $420.7 million across AI infrastructure, token acquisitions, and startup investments requires sophisticated management and strategic discipline. The company must demonstrate it can allocate capital effectively across these diverse areas. The Bigger Picture: AI Meets Blockchain AlphaTON’s focus on funding Telegram’s Cocoon AI network deserves special attention. This represents one of the most concrete examples of blockchain and artificial intelligence convergence in the current market. The integration could work in both directions: blockchain technology might provide the transparency and security framework for AI systems, while AI could enhance blockchain applications through improved analytics and user experiences. AlphaTON’s substantial investment suggests the company sees this intersection as particularly promising. For the TON token specifically, this development could drive increased utility and demand. If Cocoon AI becomes widely adopted within Telegram’s massive user base, the underlying blockchain infrastructure—and its native token—could see corresponding growth. Conclusion: A Strategic Bet on Convergence AlphaTON’s $420.7 million securities filing represents more than just a fundraising effort. It’s a strategic declaration that positions the company at the convergence of artificial intelligence, blockchain technology, and traditional finance. The move demonstrates growing institutional confidence in structured approaches to digital asset investment while highlighting the expanding possibilities of the TON ecosystem. As AlphaTON deploys this capital toward AI infrastructure, token acquisition, and ecosystem investments, the crypto community will watch closely. The success or challenges the company faces could provide valuable insights into how traditional financial instruments can support innovative blockchain applications. One thing is clear: AlphaTON isn’t thinking small, and its ambitions could help shape how AI and blockchain technologies evolve together. Frequently Asked Questions What is a Form S-3 shelf registration? A Form S-3 is a regulatory filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission that allows companies to register securities for future offering. The “shelf” aspect means the company can issue these securities over time when market conditions are favorable, rather than all at once. How will AlphaTON use the $420.7 million? The company plans to allocate funds across three main areas: expanding AI and high-performance computing infrastructure for Telegram’s Cocoon AI network, purchasing TON tokens and related digital assets, and investing in startups within the TON ecosystem. What is AlphaTON’s relationship with Telegram? AlphaTON is a Digital Asset Treasury firm specifically for the TON token, which is integrated with Telegram’s messaging platform. While separate entities, their strategies are closely aligned, particularly regarding blockchain and AI development. How might this securities filing affect TON token value? While direct impacts are uncertain, substantial investment in the TON ecosystem could increase utility and demand for the token. However, cryptocurrency values depend on numerous factors beyond single corporate actions. Is this a common practice for crypto companies? Traditional securities filings by Nasdaq-listed crypto companies are becoming more common as the industry matures. However, the scale of AlphaTON’s filing and its specific focus on AI infrastructure represents a notable development. What risks should investors consider? Potential risks include regulatory challenges, market condition fluctuations affecting securities issuance, and execution risks in deploying substantial capital across diverse initiatives.

55368474,639912,1764889217,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/55368474.jpeg,"Ethereum Whale Redistribution Continues: Moves 5,000 ETH As Price Reclaims $3K Level",https://bitcoinist.com/ethereum-whale-redistribution-continues-moves-5000/,"Ethereum is showing notable relative strength as it reclaims the $3,150 level and attempts to push higher, signaling early signs of recovery after weeks dominated by heavy selling pressure, fear, and uncertainty. The broader market rebound has helped restore confidence, but ETH’s ability to outperform key altcoins highlights growing demand and improved sentiment around the asset. Adding to the renewed optimism, fresh on-chain data from Lookonchain reveals a significant move from one of the market’s most recognized whales. During the rebound, whale 0xdECF deposited another 5,000 ETH—worth approximately $15.52 million—into Binance. This wallet has become well-known for sending large batches of ETH to exchanges throughout the recent downturn, often coinciding with moments of heightened volatility and capitulation. Its latest deposit suggests that the whale remains highly active and responsive to market conditions. While such movements can sometimes introduce uncertainty, they also highlight increasing liquidity and engagement from major holders. With price reclaiming key levels and whales repositioning, Ethereum enters a critical phase where sustained strength could confirm a broader shift in market structure. Ethereum Whale Distribution Highlights Market Caution According to Lookonchain, whale 0xdECF has sold 25,603 ETH—valued at approximately $85.44 million—across Binance and Galaxy Digital since October 28. Despite this substantial distribution , the wallet still holds 5,000 ETH (around $15.52 million), suggesting that the whale has not fully exited its position but has significantly reduced exposure during the recent market decline. This pattern of behavior provides important insight into sentiment among large holders: while they are not abandoning Ethereum entirely, they are actively managing risk and responding to volatility more aggressively than usual. Such persistent selling pressure from a large wallet often acts as a drag on price during periods of weakness, especially when market liquidity is thin. However, the fact that the whale continues to retain a meaningful position indicates an expectation of potential recovery—or at least a desire to remain strategically exposed to future upside. Ethereum now finds itself in a critical phase. The asset has reclaimed key levels, but its mid-term structure remains highly sensitive to macro conditions and whale behavior. If selling from major holders slows and accumulation begins to outpace distribution, the recent rebound could solidify into a sustained trend. Otherwise, renewed sell flows could place Ethereum at risk of revisiting lower support zones. ETH Reclaims Short-Term Momentum but Faces Heavy Resistance Ethereum’s daily chart shows a clear improvement in momentum after reclaiming the $3,150–$3,200 region, but the broader structure remains fragile. The bounce from the $2,750–$2,850 support zone marked a decisive shift in buyer behavior, with strong lower wicks indicating aggressive demand. This rebound has pushed ETH back above key short-term levels, yet the asset still faces a challenging path forward. Price is now approaching the 50-day SMA, currently sloping downward just above $3,250, which now acts as immediate resistance. This moving average has capped every rally since late October and remains the first major barrier for bulls to reclaim. Beyond it, the 100-day SMA around $3,450 and the 200-day SMA near $3,600 form a tight cluster of overhead resistance that defines the medium-term downtrend. Volume on the recent bounce is stronger than previous attempts, signaling that buyers are showing more conviction compared to the mid-November attempts to recover. However, the overall trend still leans bearish until ETH can break above the 50-day SMA and begin closing daily candles over $3,300. Ethereum sits in a critical inflection zone: holding above $3,100 strengthens the case for continued recovery, while rejection from the $3,250–$3,300 band could trigger another retest of the $2,800 region. The next few sessions will determine whether this rebound evolves into a deeper trend reversal.

As the broader crypto landscape begins to stabilize, ETH stands out as one of the assets showing early signs of recovery, drawing renewed attention from traders and long-term investors alike. Related Reading: Tron Hits $80.2B Stablecoin Milestone After Tether Mints 1B USDT On The Network A key factor supporting this shift is the Net Unrealized Profit/Loss (NUPL) reading for Ethereum on Binance, which is currently sitting around 0.22 while price trades near $3,100. This level reflects a delicate equilibrium between fear and optimism, indicating that a significant portion of ETH holders remain in moderate profit. Importantly, NUPL has not yet moved into the “greed” zone typically seen in the late stages of a bullish cycle, suggesting that the market is far from overheated. Instead, Ethereum appears to be transitioning into a more neutral, constructive phase where investors are cautiously optimistic but not excessively euphoric. This balance often forms the foundation for a healthier recovery, especially after a deep correction. If momentum continues building and NUPL remains stable or trends higher, ETH could be positioning itself for a stronger upside move in the coming weeks. NUPL Signals a Transitional Market Phase Arab Chain notes that Ethereum’s NUPL index experienced a significant rise between June and August, reaching levels far higher than today and reflecting strong profitability across the network during mid-2025. At that time, investor sentiment leaned toward optimism, supported by rising prices and improving macro conditions. However, as Ethereum’s price began to decline steadily from October onward, unrealized profits started to shrink. This pushed NUPL down toward more neutral territory, signaling a shift in sentiment from elevated optimism to a more grounded, cautious outlook. Crucially, NUPL has not fallen into negative territory, meaning the average ETH holder has not transitioned into unrealized losses. This is an important sign of underlying market strength. When investors remain in profit, they tend to be less motivated to sell aggressively at lower prices, reducing the risk of panic-driven capitulation and helping stabilize price action during corrections. Taken together, these signals indicate that Ethereum is currently in a transitional phase. The market is neither euphoric nor fearful—rather, it is waiting for a decisive catalyst to define the next trend. As long as NUPL stays above 0.20, Ethereum retains a meaningful level of investor confidence, increasing the likelihood of a rebound if liquidity strengthens or positive fundamental developments emerge.

The long lower wick from last week’s candle confirms strong buy-side interest around the $2,700–$2,800 zone, an area that has historically acted as a major demand region during multi-month corrections. ETH has now reclaimed the 100-week SMA, a key trend indicator currently positioned near $2,900, signaling renewed structural stability. The 200-week SMA, sitting comfortably lower, continues to reinforce the long-term uptrend. However, the 50-week SMA, which has flattened and now looms around the $3,350–$3,400 level, represents the next significant resistance level. ETH will need a decisive weekly close above this moving average to confirm a true shift back into bullish momentum.

Micro1, a three-year-old startup, has just revealed a staggering financial milestone that underscores this reality: crossing $100 million in annual recurring revenue (ARR). This explosive growth from just $7 million at the start of the year positions Micro1 as a formidable competitor to established players like Scale AI and highlights the immense, often overlooked, market for human-curated AI training data. For cryptocurrency and tech investors, this signals where substantial capital is flowing as AI development intensifies. How Micro1 Achieved Explosive ARR Growth in AI Data Training Micro1’s financial trajectory is nothing short of remarkable. Founded by 24-year-old CEO Ali Ansari while at UC Berkeley, the company began 2025 with approximately $7 million in ARR. According to Ansari’s exclusive statement to Bitcoin World, that figure has now soared past $100 million. This represents growth of more than 1,300% in under a year and more than doubles the revenue Micro1 reported in September 2024 when it announced its $35 million Series A funding round at a $500 million valuation. The company’s core business involves recruiting and managing human domain experts who create and evaluate the training data essential for developing advanced AI systems. This includes work with leading AI labs like Microsoft and other Fortune 100 companies focused on improving large language models through techniques like reinforcement learning and post-training. Micro1’s growth acceleration coincided with significant industry shifts, particularly after OpenAI and Google DeepMind reportedly severed ties with Scale AI following Meta’s massive $14 billion investment in that vendor. This created immediate opportunities for competitors to capture market share in the suddenly more competitive landscape. Micro1 Versus Scale AI and Other Competitors in the Data Training Arena While Micro1’s $100M ARR represents impressive growth, the company still trails larger competitors in absolute revenue terms. According to industry sources speaking to Bitcoin World, Mercor reportedly exceeds $450 million in ARR, while Surge is said to have reached approximately $1.2 billion in 2024 revenue. However, Micro1’s differentiation lies in its specialized approach to recruiting and evaluating domain experts. The company began as an AI recruiter called Zara, matching engineering talent with software roles before pivoting to the data-training market. This background informs their proprietary tool that interviews and vets applicants seeking expert roles on their platform. Company Reported ARR/Revenue Primary Focus Key Differentiator Micro1 $100M+ ARR Domain expert recruitment & management Proprietary vetting system, early robotics data focus Mercor $450M+ ARR AI training data solutions Scale, established enterprise relationships Surge $1.2B (2024) Comprehensive AI data services Full-service platform, global operations Scale AI Private (historically dominant) Data annotation & validation Pioneer in the space, Meta partnership Ansari attributes Micro1’s competitive edge to their ability to quickly identify and onboard true domain specialists across hundreds of fields, from highly technical disciplines to surprisingly offline domains. The platform currently manages thousands of experts, many earning close to $100 per hour, including Harvard professors and Stanford PhDs who dedicate significant time to training AI through Micro1. The Critical Role of Human Experts in Advancing AI Systems Micro1’s business model rests on a fundamental truth about contemporary AI development: despite advances in synthetic data generation and automated training techniques, human expertise remains irreplaceable for creating high-quality training data and evaluating model performance. This is particularly true for: Reinforcement Learning: Human feedback is essential for creating reward models that guide AI behavior Model Evaluation: Experts assess output quality, identify biases, and grade performance Specialized Knowledge: Domain-specific expertise ensures accuracy in technical, medical, legal, and other specialized fields Edge Cases: Humans identify and address scenarios that automated systems might miss “There are Harvard professors and Stanford PhDs spending half their week training AI through Micro1,” Ansari revealed. “But the bigger shift is in the sheer volume and range of roles. It’s expanding into areas you wouldn’t expect to matter for language model training, including offline and less technical fields.” The $100 Billion Market Opportunity in AI Data Training Ansari projects that the market for human-generated AI training data will expand dramatically from its current estimated $10-15 billion to nearly $100 billion within two years. This growth will be driven by two emerging segments that are currently barely visible but poised for explosive expansion: Enterprise AI Agent Development: Non-AI-native Fortune 1000 companies will begin building AI agents for internal workflows, support operations, finance, and industry-specific tasks. Developing these agents requires systematic human evaluation at every stage: testing frontier models, grading output, selecting winners, fine-tuning, and continuous validation. Robotics Pre-training: The next frontier in AI requires high-quality, human-generated demonstrations of everyday physical tasks. Micro1 is already building what Ansari calls “the world’s largest robotics pre-training dataset,” collecting demonstrations from hundreds of generalists recording object interactions in their homes. “We anticipate that a good portion of the product budgets at non AI-native enterprises will go towards evals and human data, moving from 0% to at least 25% of product budgets,” Ansari explained. “We’re also helping robotics labs create robotics data; these two areas will account for a massive share of that $100 billion a year market.” What Micro1’s Growth Means for the Future of AI Development Micro1’s rapid ascent signals several important trends in the AI industry: Human-in-the-loop systems are becoming more valuable, not less: As AI capabilities advance, the need for sophisticated human evaluation and specialized training data increases correspondingly The market is fragmenting: No single player will dominate the entire AI data training ecosystem, creating opportunities for specialized competitors Quality matters more than quantity: The shift toward domain expertise over general annotation suggests a maturation in how the industry approaches training data New applications drive new data needs: Robotics and enterprise AI agents represent entirely new categories of demand For now, Ansari says Micro1 is focused on scaling responsibly, paying experts well, and “keeping people at the center of an industry built on training machines.” The company’s early moves into robotics data and enterprise agent development, combined with scaling its specialized reinforcement learning environments, position it to capture additional market share as competition intensifies. Frequently Asked Questions What is Micro1 and what does it do? Micro1 is a startup that helps AI labs and enterprises recruit and manage human domain experts for creating and evaluating AI training data. The company connects specialists across hundreds of fields with organizations developing advanced AI systems. Who founded Micro1? Micro1 was founded by Ali Ansari while he was a student at UC Berkeley. Ansari, now 24, serves as the company’s CEO. How does Micro1 compare to Scale AI? Both companies operate in the AI data training space, but Micro1 positions itself as more focused on recruiting and managing true domain experts rather than general data annotation. Scale AI, which received a $14 billion investment from Meta , has historically dominated the market but faces increased competition following reported departures of major clients like OpenAI and Google DeepMind. What companies use Micro1’s services? Micro1 works with leading AI labs including Microsoft as well as Fortune 100 companies. While specific client names beyond Microsoft aren’t disclosed, the company serves organizations racing to improve large language models through techniques like reinforcement learning. What is the market size for AI data training? According to Micro1’s estimates, the current market for human-generated AI training data is approximately $10-15 billion, but is projected to grow to nearly $100 billion within two years as new applications like enterprise AI agents and robotics create additional demand. Conclusion Micro1’s journey from $7M to $100M+ in ARR in under a year reveals more than just another startup success story. It exposes the critical, often invisible, human infrastructure powering the AI revolution. As artificial intelligence systems grow more sophisticated, their dependence on high-quality human expertise paradoxically increases. The companies that can best identify, organize, and deploy this expertise stand to capture extraordinary value in what is rapidly becoming a hundred-billion-dollar market. For investors and industry observers, Micro1’s explosive growth serves as a powerful indicator of where the real bottlenecks—and opportunities—reside in the race toward artificial general intelligence.

Internet Computer protocol price forecast for 2028 expects the token to reach a peak price of $14.03. By 2031, the price of Internet Computer might reach a maximum of $22.81. Internet Computer (ICP) is a groundbreaking blockchain network developed by the DFINITY Foundation. It aims to extend the functionality of the internet, enabling it to host backend software and transforming it into a global, decentralized computer. Internet computer blockchain incorporates advanced cryptography and innovative technology to provide scalable, efficient, and secure decentralized applications (dApps). Given its robust technology and expanding utility, the Internet Computer blockchain’s future price prospects look promising. As more developers build on the platform and adoption increases, ICP token demand will likely rise. Does Internet Computer coin have a future? How much will Internet Computer coin cost in 2025? Will ICP reach $1000? Let’s get into the current price analysis and predictions. Overview Cryptocurrency Internet Computer Token ICP Price $3.69 Market Cap $1.99B Trading Volume $99.89M Circulating Supply 541.49M ICP All-time High $750.73 (May 10, 2021) All-time Low $2.86 (Sep 2023) 24-h High $3.86 24-h Low $3.62 Internet Computer Network technical analysis Metric Value Volatility (30-day period) 25.54% (Extremely High) 14-Day RSI 40.56 (Neutral) 50-Day SMA $4.44 Sentiment Bearish Fear & Greed Index 26 (Fear) Green Days 11/30 (37 %) 200-Day SMA $5.11 Internet Computer price analysis TL;DR Breakdown ICP is holding a thin support near $3.69 while bearish momentum slowly cools. The 4-hour chart shows early signs of stabilization but no confirmed breakout. Oversold money flow suggests a potential relief bounce, but resistance at $3.74–$3.78 remains a significant barrier. ICP 1-day price analysis As seen on the 1-day chart for December 4, ICP continues to hover around $3.69, pressing against the lower half of its Bollinger Bands, showing a market that has lost directional conviction but hasn’t fully broken down. The price remains below the mid-band at $4.31, keeping bears marginally in control. However, the bands are tightening, suggesting a potential volatility squeeze is forming. If bulls fail to defend the $3.60–$3.55 region, the lower band near $3.24 becomes the next vulnerability. However, the current slow drift lower suggests exhaustion rather than aggressive selling. ICPUSDT 1-day price chart by TradingView The momentum remains weak with the MACD deeply negative and its histogram still printing soft red bars, reflecting lingering bearish pressure even as the rate of decline slows. Meanwhile, the MFI sits at 29, approaching oversold territory, which often precedes short-term relief bounces. This combination of compressed volatility, fading bearish momentum, and near-oversold money flow implies ICP is closer to stabilizing than breaking down, but hasn’t yet found the strength for a reversal. ICP 4-hour price analysis On the 4-hour chart, ICP trades slightly above $3.69 with price attempting to steady after a sequence of uneven candles. The Alligator lines are starting to compress, suggesting directionless movement and a market waiting for a catalyst. The jaw at $3.78 still leans downward, maintaining overhead pressure, while the lips and teeth around $3.73–$3.74 indicate that buyers are attempting to regain micro-control but haven’t yet overcome resistance. ICPUSDT 4-hour price chart by TradingView The MACD has crossed slightly bullish, printing faint green bars and showing the first signs of upward momentum. However, the weak slope and proximity to the zero line show that buyers lack follow-through. If price can reclaim $3.74–$3.78, a short burst toward $3.82 becomes feasible, but failure to hold $3.66–$3.65 may re-expose the lower range and put $3.60 back into play. ICP technical indicators: Levels and action Daily simple moving average (SMA) Period Value Action SMA 3 $4.13 SELL SMA 5 $4.06 SELL SMA 10 $4.15 SELL SMA 21 $4.55 SELL SMA 50 $4.44 SELL SMA 100 $4.48 SELL SMA 200 $5.11 SELL Daily exponential moving average (EMA) Period Value Action EMA 3 $4.46 SELL EMA 5 $4.50 SELL EMA 10 $4.55 SELL EMA 21 $4.73 SELL EMA 50 $4.99 SELL EMA 100 $5.20 SELL EMA 200 $5.77 SELL What to expect from ICP price analysis ICP is likely to stay range-bound with a mild upward bias if $3.65 holds, but only a close above $3.78 would signal a meaningful recovery attempt. Failure to maintain current support risks a retest of $3.55–$3.24. Is Internet Computer a good investment? The Internet Computer (ICP) has shown significant potential and volatility since its launch, which is common for relatively new and ambitious blockchain projects. Its technology aims to decentralize the internet and bring smart contract functionality to the web, which could have wide-ranging implications for the future of web speed.

A new report from banking giant JP Morgan delivers a crucial insight for investors watching the volatile saga of companies like Strategy that hold Bitcoin on their balance sheets. The analysts argue that the risk of an MSCI exclusion has been largely priced in, potentially capping further dramatic losses. This perspective offers a lifeline of clarity in a confusing period for crypto-correlated stocks. What Did JP Morgan Actually Say About the MSCI Exclusion Risk? JP Morgan’s research team provided a detailed assessment of the situation facing Strategy. The core of their argument is straightforward: the market is efficient. The massive 40% drop in Strategy’s stock price between October and early December acts as concrete evidence that investors have already priced in a high probability of removal from the MSCI indices. Therefore, the actual event of an MSCI exclusion , while negative, may not trigger another collapse. The report describes the current share price as reflecting the potential for exclusion from all major indices, not just MSCI. This analysis shifts the investor focus from fear of an unknown event to evaluation of an already discounted one. How Does This Situation Connect Strategy and Bitcoin? The fate of Strategy and the price of Bitcoin are now intertwined in the eyes of institutional analysts. JP Morgan identifies MSCI’s final decision as the most critical variable for both. Here’s why the connection matters: Institutional Sentiment: An MSCI exclusion would signal a regulatory or reputational caution from a major index provider, affecting all companies with digital asset treasuries (DATs). Market Liquidity: Index funds that track MSCI would be forced to sell Strategy’s stock, creating automatic selling pressure. Bitcoin Correlation: Negative news for a major Bitcoin-holding company often spills over into broader crypto market sentiment, impacting BTC’s price. JP Morgan’s view suggests this feedback loop is already accounted for in current valuations. What Are the Potential Scenarios for Strategy’s Stock Now? The path forward hinges on MSCI’s verdict. JP Morgan outlines two clear scenarios based on the outcome, providing a framework for investor expectations. The Downside Scenario (Exclusion Happens): Even if MSCI decides to exclude Strategy, JP Morgan projects that the downside pressure would be limited. The brutal sell-off has likely done the heavy lifting. While the stock may dip further on the news, the floor may be closer than many fear. The Upside Scenario (Inclusion Maintained): This is where it gets interesting. If MSCI decides against exclusion, JP Morgan sees potential for a powerful rebound. The stock could rally back toward the price levels seen before the major sell-off on October 10th. This would represent a significant recovery, rewarding investors who held through the uncertainty. Why Should Crypto Investors Pay Attention to This Analysis? This isn’t just about one stock. The JP Morgan report is a masterclass in how traditional finance interprets crypto-market events. It demonstrates that: Major banks are closely modeling crypto-linked equity risks. Market efficiency principles apply to volatile crypto assets. Institutional frameworks are being used to gauge downside limits and upside potential. For anyone invested in Bitcoin or crypto-related stocks, understanding this institutional perspective is invaluable. It moves the narrative from panic to calculated risk assessment. Conclusion: Navigating Uncertainty with Clarity JP Morgan’s analysis cuts through the noise surrounding the potential MSCI exclusion . By framing the dramatic price drop as the market pricing in the risk, they provide a logical anchor in a turbulent sea. The key takeaway is that the largest wave of selling may have already passed. Whether the final decision brings relief or confirmation, the immediate financial shock appears contained. This offers a more measured landscape for investors to navigate, emphasizing research over reaction. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) What is an MSCI exclusion? An MSCI exclusion occurs when a company is removed from a major global stock index managed by MSCI Inc. This can force index-tracking funds to sell the stock, often leading to significant selling pressure. Why is MSCI reviewing companies like Strategy? MSCI is reviewing companies that hold digital assets like Bitcoin on their balance sheets (Digital Asset Treasuries or DATs) due to potential regulatory, custody, and valuation concerns associated with cryptocurrencies. What does ‘priced in’ mean? ‘Priced in’ means that the market has already anticipated a future event and adjusted asset prices accordingly. In this case, the large drop in Strategy’s stock price suggests investors have already accounted for a high chance of exclusion. How does this affect Bitcoin’s price? Negative news for a major corporate Bitcoin holder can hurt overall market sentiment and increase perceived risk, potentially putting downward pressure on Bitcoin’s price. Conversely, a positive resolution could boost confidence. What other companies could be affected by such reviews? Any publicly traded company that holds significant cryptocurrencies as treasury assets could face similar scrutiny from index providers and institutional investors in the future.

Among today’s big gainers are Zcash (+9.5%), Bittensor (+7.5%), Avalanche (+4.5%), Ethereum (+3.5%), and Cardano (+2.5%), while Bitcoin has more or less remained stuck at $92,950. Investors have regained optimism in recent days amid a growing expectation that the Federal Reserve will soon provide another cut to interest rates , something which, in combination with the arrival of more altcoin ETFs, could send prices higher across the board. Now may therefore be an ideal time to diversify into newer coins, with this article unpacking our best new meme coin to buy today, PEPENODE ($PEPENODE) , a new mining token that could surge upon listing in the next few weeks. Best New Meme Coin to Buy Today – 4 December PEPENODE has now raised an impressive $2.26 million in its ongoing presale, which opened a couple of months ago and is already doing a stellar job of attracting new investors. Its main pull is that it’s planning to do something which no coin or platform has done before, which is to provide users with the ability to mine tokens without needing traditional mining hardware. Mapping your next move in Pepenode isn’t flavor. It’s core gameplay that determines how fast you climb upgrade those Nodes! https://t.co/FaKIaBpf4I pic.twitter.com/vY69IDm3C1 — PEPENODE (@pepenode_io) November 27, 2025 Instead, users can simply use PEPENODE tokens to buy virtual mining nodes, which they can acquire in order to grow their own virtual mining rigs. They can use these rigs to mine external tokens, including Pepe and Fartcoin (more will come later). What’s interesting is that, by buying more nodes, upgrading and combining them, users can earn greater rewards. This dynamic should provide a strong incentive to buy more PEPENODE, so as to acquire more nodes, something which could boost the new token’s price over time. Nodes can be sold if a users want to reduce the size of their rig, or to close it completely, while they can also stake PEPENODE in order to obtain a passive income. At the moment, PEPENODE is providing a staking yield of 573% APY , making it one of the more profitable staking tokens in the market right now. PEPENODE has the Potential to Surge After Listing: How to Buy Given these features, and given the fact that PEPENODE’s sale has attracted substantial interest, it could surge when lists, which is why it’s our best new meme coin to buy today. Investors can buy it by going to its official website and connecting a compatible wallet, such as Best Wallet. They can buy any amount of PEPENODE they want, using ETH, USDT, BNB, or fiat (via debit/credit card). The token is currently selling at a price of $0.0011778, although this will rise again tomorrow and will continue to rise every three days until the sale closes. Because the market seems to be preparing for a big end-of-year rebound, PEPENODE may be timing its launch and listings perfectly. It has the potential to have a very big 2026, and could remain our best new meme coin to buy for a while yet.

Mullen suggested that users may be withdrawing their funds, and exchanges may be reorganizing. The network may also be experiencing broad restructuring. Outliers in The Trend At the same time, a few exceptions stood out. Evernorth, the recently launched XRP treasury operator , increased its holdings by more than 13%. Coincheck also reported a considerable rise of 550 million XRP. OKX registered a large percentage gain that may be linked to reclassified addresses.

While there are exceptions, the trend of shrinking supply has grown in recent months, with BitGo recently running out of tokens . Exchanges have fallen to 15.86 billion XRP, representing a decline of more than 6.5 billion XRP since early in the year. He noted that the trend suggests a contraction in available liquidity. However, he acknowledged that the findings have not been confirmed. Rich-List Activity and ETF Impact on Supply Mullen’s review of the XRP rich list showed continued activity among major holders, with the top 10,000 wallets now holding more than 51 billion XRP. New accounts acquired over 77 million XRP in a day, and existing wallets added nearly 18 million. Others released more than 108 million back into circulation. He said this reflects repositioning rather than exits. At the same time, XRP ETFs have gathered well over $800 million in inflows since mid-November. This represents over $400 million at XRP’s current price. This adds supply pressure and supports expectations of a larger market move.

Solana Price Predictions: Could Vanguard Fuel a $1000 Move This fresh touch point for inflows arrives as Solana flashes its strongest bottom signal yet with a double bottom pattern forming along a historic support trendline. The $120 level has marked local bottoms throughout the bullish phase of the market cycle, and it appears to act as a launchpad yet again as momentum indicators flip bullish.

The RSI is testing the neutral line after being trapped in oversold conditions for the past 2 months while the RSI builds a lead above the signal line. Both suggest that buyers are taking control of the prevailing trend. With a decisive break above the double bottom neckline at $144, the fully realised structure eyes a push to $210. This would trigger a retest of a wider year-long descending triangle pattern, creating a potential breakout scenario eyeing much higher targets around $500, a 250% gain.

As institutional appetite for blockchain tech keeps rising, this favors a bullish Ethereum price prediction . Antithesis, a firm based in North Carolina, received $105 million during its Series A funding round, led by Jane Street. A fast-growing Vienna software testing startup whose tools find bugs in computer programming code, has landed $100 million in a Series A fundraising round led by one its largest customers. https://t.co/ZuyFG9hJrF — Washington Business Journal (@WBJonline) December 3, 2025 According to Antithesis, they helped Ethereum during its transition to a proof-of-stake (PoS) consensus protocol through its advanced simulations and stress tests to ensure that the upgrade went through no matter what. Its systems can allegedly replay any bug that shows up during the deployment of new software. As a result, engineers can quickly identify exactly what went wrong to correct it immediately. As blockchain technology becomes stronger, smart contracts platforms like Ethereum will likely be adopted by big institutions. They are viewed as the infrastructure for the next generation of financial applications running on independent networks. Ethereum Price Prediction: Double Bottom Could Confirm the Begining of ETH’s Next Leg Up Ethereum (ETH) recently jumped after making a double bottom at $2,750. This confirms the relevance of this price level for market participants and justifies a bullish Ethereum price prediction. Source: TradingView In the past 24 hours alone, ETH has gained 4.2% while trading volumes remain high at $31 billion. This figure accounts for 8% of the token’s circulating market cap. In the daily chart, the Relative Strength Index (RSI) has also jumped above the mid-line. This means that positive momentum is accelerating. If the rally continues, a bullish breakout of the $3,350 resistance could confirm a trend reversal. This could result in a full-blown recovery for ETH that pushes the token back to $4,000 within the next few weeks. As cryptos start to recover, innovative crypto presales that further strengthen existing networks like Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) will likely capture the most upside. This layer-2 chain for Bitcoin leverages the power of the Solana blockchain to lower transaction costs and increase the network’s speed. Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) is Launching a Solana-Powered Layer for Bitcoin Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) is designed to eliminate the hurdles that have prevented the Bitcoin ecosystem from further growth.

The often-overlooked Bollinger Bands may be the clearest tell. After spending two months below the central basis line, the meme coin has finally broken above it as buyers return.

Pepe Price Prediction: The Strongest Bottom Signal Yet? This potential bottom appears to have taken shape as a double-bottom reversal, with a second bounce along the $0.000004 level now gaining momentum. Pepe now tests the pattern’s neckline at $0.0000049, a level that must flip to support to confirm the bullish setup. Momentum indicators support further upside. The MACD widens its gap above the signal line while the RSI approaches the 50 neutral line for the first time in two months, both signals that buyers are controlling the move. Fully realised, the pattern targets a measured 50% move to reclaim November highs at $0.0000075. But if this level can be flipped to support, it may mark the start of an extended rally. And with supportive market conditions, such as a U.S. interest rate ease in December to stimulate demand for riskier plays PEPE, it could push 240% to May highs at $0.0000165. Pepe Node: A Better Way to Buy the Dip If the past two months have proven anything, it’s that it can be difficult to buy the dip on volatile tokens like meme coins without leaving yourself exposed to heavy losses. PepeNode ($PEPENODE) helps with an easier way to accumulate, without needing to time the market — the pitfall of most meme coin investors. It’s a simple mine-to-earn (M2E) game. No hardware needed. Just log in, acquire virtual nodes, stack rigs, and configure your setup to start earning passive rewards, diversified across top-performing meme coins. Momentum is climbing fast. The presale has already passed $2.25 million, while early stakers can still earn up to 573% APY. And thanks to a built-in deflationary model, where 70% of all $PEPENODE spent on nodes and rigs is burned, scarcity supports long-term token value. PepeNode stands out as a smarter way to capture some of the market’s strongest upside—without worrying about timing the perfect entry.

His outlook for Bitcoin has prompted renewed debate within the XRP community, especially around how XRP could react if his target plays out. To reflect this shift in focus, the discussion now centers primarily on the relationship between Bitcoin’s projected strength and the potential scale of XRP’s response. Garlinghouse Predicts Bitcoin to Reach $180,000 While participating in a panel session with Binance CEO Richard Teng and Solana Foundation President Lily Liu, Garlinghouse delivered a headline-making prediction. He stated, “I’ll go out on a limb, and I’ll say, Bitcoin $180,000 Dec. 31, 2026.” His remark stands out as the only precise target among the speakers. Teng declined to provide any numerical forecast, emphasizing his long-term approach by saying, “I can’t make a price prediction…..I’m a long-term holder, so I’m not looking at short-term price volatility.” Liu’s outlook placed BTC above $100,000 , aligning with a generally strong trajectory but avoiding a specific figure. Garlinghouse’s assertive stance has since become the basis for new calculations within the XRP community , as several commentators believe XRP could experience amplified gains if Bitcoin achieves the projected rally. Historical Behavior of XRP During Bitcoin Rallies Community analyst Arthur revisited prior market cycles to outline why XRP might react more aggressively than Bitcoin if BTC advances toward the projected $180,000 level. According to him, altcoins such as XRP typically outperform BTC in percentage terms when Bitcoin doubles in price, often rising between threefold and fivefold during similar periods. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 There are two recent examples to support this pattern. In November 2024, Bitcoin climbed from $70,000 to $109,000, marking a 1.5x gain. Within that same window, XRP rose from $0.50 to $3.40, an increase of 6.8x. A comparable trend appeared again in July 2025 when Bitcoin advanced 8% to $115,750. XRP then surged 35% to $3.02, outperforming BTC by more than four times. These instances have strengthened the argument that XRP tends to record comparatively larger movements in moments of broad-market momentum. Possible XRP Price if Ripple CEO’s Forecast Plays Out Building on the CEO’s $180,000 target, Arthur has outlined a potential range for XRP if the pattern repeats. Based on previous multipliers, he estimates that XRP could move to the $6 to $10 region, representing a threefold to fivefold expansion from current levels, should Bitcoin meet Garlinghouse’s projection. His view aligns with the stance of analysts such as ChartNerd, who have also suggested that XRP may be positioned for a move toward the $10 threshold. It is generally assumed that higher outcomes could materialize if additional favorable conditions develop. In particular, the introduction of sustained real-world utility is often cited as a factor that could place XRP within a more elevated price range of $15 to $20. This aligns with broader expectations within the community, where many believe that substantial capital inflows into potential XRP-based exchange-traded funds could reinforce and extend a market rally.

Bitcoin, Ethereum, And Solana Build Powerful High-Time-Frame Structures",https://www.newsbtc.com/news/bitcoin-ethereum-and-solana-2/,"In the volatile theatre of the cryptocurrency market, Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Solana are showing signs of a potential high-time-frame reversal. After weeks of stress and price compression, each of the top assets is now stabilizing at key structural support levels. The multiple leading cryptocurrencies are flashing similar recovery setups at the same time. The current crypto landscape may be setting up one of the most powerful high-time-frame reversals across Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Solana. An investor and trader known as MacroCRG on X highlighted that yesterday, all three assets printed a bullish engulfing candle, a strong signal that buyers are stepping back in with intent. Market Leaders Hint At A Shift Before Smaller Assets Follow On the weekly chart, each asset is showing the early stages of an inside-week breakout paired with a false breakdown. MacroCRG pointed out that a similar structure on the ES (S&P 500 futures) chart from April, where the breakdown of inside-week structure led to a breakout that never looked back when the bull secured the weekly close.

However, there’s still a long way to go before the weekly close will confirm the breakout, and the bulls need to follow through with conviction and remove any doubt. The founder of the ProMintClub investment community, ProMint, has spotted a high-conviction whale trader aggressively building long positions across the crypto market. Currently, the trader is leading the Lighter leaderboard with over $64 million in profit and loss, while maintaining an 83% long bias. His Lighter account has the highest profit and loss with over $8 million. These are insane numbers compared to everyone else on the leaderboard. Data shows that the trader has made five deposits into his Lighter account, which total around $6 million in capital. His positions are spread across BTC, ETH, SOL, AAVE, along with smaller plays such as PAXG and PUMP, consistently entering at strong timing points and riding momentum higher. Even though funding costs have flipped heavily negative, he is not backing down. Presently, this is the top-performing account on Lighter, and this is serious capital deployed with conviction.

Hoskinson has shared a strategic game plan for 2026 that could significantly transform the Cardano ecosystem and potentially even influence the value of its native token. Although ADA’s price has underperformed other top altcoins so far this year, upcoming developments and shifts in 2026 could create a better environment for a potential recovery. Cardano 2026 Game Plan Offers Hope For ADA Price Recovery In a recent video posted on X, Hoskinson shared his thoughts on Cardano, offering a glimpse into the blockchain’s vision for 2026. According to the crypto founder, Cardano is preparing to enter the new year with a plan to become a powerful and exceptional blockchain network and the most relatable distribution system humanity has ever created. Hoskinson emphasized that achieving this vision will require significant time and effort, acknowledging that setbacks are part of building a complex system. He noted that bugs and mistakes are inevitable, but what distinguishes a successful project is how well and fast it responds and recovers. The Cardano founder also highlighted the importance of learning from errors and improving processes, suggesting that future obstacles will be overcome more quickly and effectively. While perfection is unattainable, Hoskinson’s statements reflect confidence in Cardano’s approach to problem-solving, adaptability, and its ongoing progress toward becoming a leading blockchain network. While the blockchain prepares to advance, it remains uncertain if an ADA price recovery will follow. Currently, the cryptocurrency is trading at $0.449, reflecting a 63% decline this year and a 16.6% drop over the past month. Compared to other altcoins like Ethereum and Solana, which reached new all-time highs earlier this year, ADA’s underperformance has been somewhat of a puzzle, especially given its previous ecosystem developments and strong community . Analyst Says ADA Price Will Be Mega Bullish If It Breaks This Level The Cardano price has been trending downward for months; however, analysts remain bullish on the cryptocurrency. According to crypto analyst ‘Sssebi’, ADA’s next key milestone is the $0.50 resistance level. If the altcoin can successfully breach this threshold, he predicts that Cardano could enter a “mega bullish phase.” Sssebi’s analysis highlights that despite Cardano’s price being significantly undervalued , its underlying structure still shows hints of bullishness. Breaking $0.50, therefore, could act as a psychological trigger that helps the altcoin overcome current bearishness and signal a much-anticipated recovery. The analyst suggested that ADA’s current price of $0.44 may represent a bottom level.

Among the findings in the briefing paper on “Understanding Stablecoins,” released on Thursday, the IMF examined how countries such as the United States, the United Kingdom, Japan, and the European Union have approached efforts to formulate regulatory frameworks for stablecoins. The IMF report highlighted that emerging regulations may help mitigate risks to macroeconomic and financial stability. However, it did identify an uneven environment that featured diverse regulatory approaches and issuance structures. The IMF stated on a social media platform that s tablecoins can expand financial access and drive innovation, but also cause currency substitution and market volatility. Global cooperation on regulation is essential. The Fund is working with the Financial Stability Board (FSB), the Bank for International Settlements (BIS), and others “to close gaps and improve oversight,” the IMF added. Is the expansion of stablecoins driving market inefficiencies and risks? The IMF said that the proliferation of new stablecoins across different blockchains and exchanges raises concerns about inefficiencies stemming from a potential lack of interoperability. The organization noted that this growth can create disparities and obstacles among countries due to varying regulatory frameworks and transactional hurdles. Although regulation of stablecoins helps authorities address [certain] risks, strong macro-policies and robust institutions should be the first line of defense […] International coordination remains key to solving these issues. IMF According to the report, the largest stablecoins by market capitalization, Tether’s USDT and Circle’s USDC, were “backed mostly” by short-term US Treasuries, reverse repo collateralized with US Treasuries , and bank deposits. Forty percent of USDC’s reserves and approximately 75% of USDt’s reserves consisted of short-term US Treasuries, with Tether’s stablecoin also holding 5% of its reserves in Bitcoin. The vast majority of stablecoins worldwide include coins pegged to the US dollar. However, a small number of issuers have denominated their offerings in different currencies, such as the euro. As of December, the total market exceeds $300 billion. US GENIUS Act and EU MiCA create divergent stablecoin frameworks Following the signing of the GENIUS Act into law by US President Donald Trump in July, regulators have been moving to establish a comprehensive framework for payment stablecoins in the United States. The law imposes strict reserve requirements, bans yield-bearing stablecoins , and formally integrates stablecoin issuers into the US financial system. A new report from blockchain security auditor CertiK indicates that America’s new approach to stablecoin regulation is reshaping global liquidity flows and driving a sharp structural split with the European Union’s Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA) regime, effectively creating separate US and EU stablecoin liquidity pools. According to the report, the US digital asset market entered a new phase of regulatory clarity in 2025, with federal legislation and administrative reforms now broadly aligned on how digital assets are issued, traded, and custodied. While the framework offers long-awaited regulatory certainty for US issuers, the report warns that it also deepens the global divide with the EU’s MiCA regime, creating a separate US liquidity pool and effectively fragmenting the global stablecoin market. For this reason, CertiK anticipates that stablecoin liquidity will become highly segmented by jurisdiction, which will give rise to new cross-border settlement issues and potentially lead to regional stablecoin arbitrage. Despite the MiCA regime of the European Union following the US GENIUS Act’s requirement for full redemption at par and prohibition on yield for stablecoins, it has met resistance due to the addition of banking concentration risk, as the rules mandate a substantial fraction of issuer reserves to be held within EU-based banks. Tether’s CEO, Paolo Ardoino, cautioned that such a structure could lead to “systemic risks” for issuers, as under the fractional reserve system, banks typically lend out a sizable portion of their deposits.

However, one of the world’s most prestigious institutions saw an opportunity. Harvard University significantly increased its Bitcoin holdings during the market downturn, according to recent reports. This move reveals how sophisticated investors approach cryptocurrency volatility differently than the average trader. How Did Harvard Buy Bitcoin During the Dip? Harvard Management Company, which oversees the university’s massive $57 billion endowment, executed a strategic accumulation plan. The institution reportedly began its intensive buying phase after Bitcoin’s price peaked in October. They acquired the digital asset as it fell approximately 17% through November, demonstrating classic “buy the dip” behavior at an institutional scale. The investment vehicle of choice was BlackRock’s Bitcoin Trust. This approach allows traditional institutions to gain Bitcoin exposure without dealing with direct custody challenges. Harvard’s move signals growing institutional comfort with cryptocurrency investment structures. What Does Harvard’s Bitcoin Investment Look Like? The numbers tell a compelling story of conviction buying. In the second quarter, Harvard reported holding 1.9 million shares of BlackRock’s Bitcoin Trust, valued at $116.7 million. Then came the strategic move that turned heads across financial markets. During the third quarter, Harvard tripled its position. The university now holds 6.8 million shares worth approximately $443 million. This substantial increase occurred precisely when many investors were reducing exposure or sitting on the sidelines. Consider these key aspects of Harvard’s Bitcoin strategy: Timing precision : Buying during a 17% price decline Scale : Moving from $116 million to $443 million in holdings Vehicle selection : Using established institutional products like BlackRock’s trust Conviction : Tripling position despite market uncertainty Why Would Harvard Invest in Bitcoin Now? Institutional investors like Harvard operate with different time horizons and risk parameters than retail traders. Their decision to buy Bitcoin during dips reflects several strategic considerations. First, endowment funds seek assets that can provide uncorrelated returns to traditional markets. Bitcoin has demonstrated this characteristic historically. Second, Harvard likely views cryptocurrency as a long-term store of value and hedge against monetary inflation. With a $57 billion endowment to protect, diversification into digital assets makes strategic sense. The university’s investment team has been studying cryptocurrency for years before making this substantial move. Third, the timing suggests Harvard believes in Bitcoin’s fundamental value proposition regardless of short-term price fluctuations. Buying during fear periods often generates the best long-term returns in volatile asset classes. What Can Retail Investors Learn from Harvard? Harvard bought Bitcoin using a method retail investors can emulate: dollar-cost averaging during downturns. While most people lack Harvard’s resources, the principles remain accessible. The key lesson is maintaining conviction during market turbulence when fundamentals remain strong. However, retail investors should note important differences. Harvard uses professional custody solutions and invests through regulated vehicles. They also conduct extensive due diligence that most individuals cannot replicate. Still, the psychological approach—buying when others are fearful—remains universally applicable. Actionable insights from Harvard’s move include: Develop an investment thesis before market volatility hits Allocate only what you can afford to hold long-term Use reputable platforms and custody solutions Ignore short-term noise focusing on long-term trends The Bigger Picture: Institutional Crypto Adoption Harvard’s substantial Bitcoin purchase represents more than just one institution’s trade. It signals broader acceptance of cryptocurrency within traditional finance. When prestigious universities allocate endowment funds to digital assets, other institutions take notice. This move follows similar investments by Yale, Stanford, and other elite universities. The trend suggests that cryptocurrency is transitioning from speculative asset to legitimate portfolio component. As more institutions follow Harvard’s lead, market structure and liquidity should improve for all participants. The most significant implication might be validation. When Harvard buys Bitcoin during dips, it communicates confidence in the asset class’s future. This psychological impact often matters as much as the financial investment itself. Conclusion: Wisdom in Volatility Harvard bought Bitcoin not despite the price decline, but because of it. Their strategic accumulation during November’s downturn demonstrates institutional sophistication in navigating cryptocurrency markets. While retail investors often react emotionally to price movements, Harvard’s endowment team executed a calculated plan based on long-term conviction. This move reinforces several important principles: volatility creates opportunity, timing matters less than time in the market, and institutional adoption continues accelerating. As cryptocurrency matures, watching how sophisticated players like Harvard navigate the space provides valuable lessons for all market participants. Frequently Asked Questions How much Bitcoin does Harvard University own? Harvard currently holds approximately $443 million worth of Bitcoin through BlackRock’s Bitcoin Trust, representing 6.8 million shares according to recent reports. When did Harvard start investing in Bitcoin? Harvard began accumulating Bitcoin more intensively after the price peaked in October, with significant purchases occurring during November’s 17% price decline. Why did Harvard choose BlackRock’s Bitcoin Trust? Institutional investors often prefer regulated investment vehicles that handle custody and compliance. BlackRock’s trust provides Bitcoin exposure without the operational complexities of direct ownership. Does Harvard’s investment mean Bitcoin is safe? No investment is completely safe, but Harvard’s substantial allocation suggests their investment committee sees favorable risk-reward characteristics in Bitcoin as part of a diversified portfolio. Should retail investors copy Harvard’s strategy? While the principle of buying during dips is sound, retail investors should consider their own risk tolerance, time horizon, and financial situation rather than blindly following any institution’s moves. What other universities invest in cryptocurrency? Yale, Stanford, MIT, and several other prestigious universities have allocated portions of their endowments to cryptocurrency and blockchain-related investments in recent years.

A wallet associated with global investment giant BlackRock has just received over $67 million worth of Bitcoin and Ethereum from leading exchange Coinbase. This transaction isn’t just a number on a screen; it’s a powerful signal about the future of digital assets. Let’s dive into what this means for the market and why the BlackRock wallet activity matters to every investor. What Does the $67.5M BlackRock Wallet Transfer Mean? According to data from Onchain lens, approximately five hours ago, a significant transfer occurred. A total of 153.83 BTC and 16,930 ETH, with a combined value of $67.48 million, moved from Coinbase to a wallet identified as belonging to BlackRock. This is not a random event. It represents a substantial, deliberate allocation by one of the world’s most influential financial institutions. Such a move from a traditional finance titan into crypto assets underscores a critical trend: institutional adoption is accelerating. When BlackRock makes a move, the entire financial world pays attention. Therefore, this transaction is a strong vote of confidence in the underlying value of Bitcoin and Ethereum. Why is the BlackRock Wallet Activity So Significant? BlackRock manages nearly $10 trillion in assets. Its investment decisions are meticulously researched and have a history of shaping market trajectories. The movement into this specific BlackRock wallet suggests a strategic accumulation, potentially for its iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) or other digital asset products. Consider the key implications of this activity: Market Validation: Large-scale purchases by institutions help legitimize cryptocurrencies as a viable asset class. Supply Pressure: Moving coins off an exchange like Coinbase into cold storage reduces immediate selling pressure, which can be bullish for prices. Future Confidence: It signals that major players are building long-term positions, not just trading short-term. How Does This Impact Bitcoin and Ethereum Investors? For everyday crypto holders, this news is more than a headline. It provides actionable insight. Institutional moves often precede broader market trends. The activity in the BlackRock wallet indicates that sophisticated investors see value at current levels and are positioning accordingly. Moreover, this reduces liquid supply on exchanges. With fewer coins readily available for sale, even modest increases in demand can lead to stronger price support. However, it’s crucial to remember that institutional investment also brings higher scrutiny and potential volatility from larger, coordinated trades. What’s Next for Institutional Crypto Adoption? This transaction is likely a single piece of a much larger puzzle. BlackRock’s public Bitcoin ETF has already seen tremendous inflows. This direct wallet activity suggests their involvement is deepening beyond publicly traded funds. We can expect other asset managers to follow suit, increasing overall demand for top-tier crypto assets. The path forward involves watching for similar movements from other institutions. Will Fidelity, Vanguard, or other giants make comparable allocations? The activity of the BlackRock wallet may have just set a new benchmark for institutional crypto strategy. Conclusion: A Defining Moment for Crypto Markets The transfer of $67.5 million in Bitcoin and Ethereum to a BlackRock wallet is a landmark event. It demonstrates that the world’s largest asset manager is not just dipping a toe but wading deeper into the crypto ecosystem. This move validates the asset class for skeptical traditional investors and provides a layer of stability and credibility. While past performance doesn’t guarantee future results, the signal from this transaction is clear: institutional capital is here to stay, and it’s building a foundation for the next chapter of finance. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: How do we know the wallet belongs to BlackRock? A1: Blockchain analytics firms like Onchain lens use a combination of publicly disclosed information, transaction patterns, and wallet labeling to identify entities. While not 100% infallible, these attributions are generally considered reliable within the crypto intelligence community. Q2: Does this mean BlackRock is buying Bitcoin and Ethereum directly? A2: Yes, this on-chain transfer indicates a direct purchase and withdrawal to a wallet they control, likely for holding as treasury assets or to support their ETF products. Q3: Why move funds from Coinbase to a private wallet? A3: Moving crypto off an exchange (to “cold storage”) is a standard security practice for long-term holders. It reduces counterparty risk and signifies an intent to hold, not trade frequently. Q4: Will this single transaction affect Bitcoin’s price? A4> While $67.5M is a large sum, the Bitcoin market cap is over $1 trillion. The psychological impact and signal it sends are more significant than the direct market impact of the trade itself. Q5: What is the difference between BlackRock’s ETF and this wallet activity? A5: The iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) is a publicly traded security that holds Bitcoin. This wallet activity could be separate treasury management or part of the fund’s operational movements to secure assets. Q6: Should I invest in crypto because BlackRock is? A6> Institutional activity is a strong data point, but it should not be your sole reason for investing. Always conduct your own research, understand the volatility, and ensure any investment aligns with your personal financial goals and risk tolerance.

Have you ever wondered if there’s a way to measure the market’s emotional pulse? The Crypto Fear & Greed Index does exactly that, and its latest reading offers a crucial glimpse into investor psychology. Today, the index has inched up to 28, a small but notable rise from yesterday. However, it remains firmly planted in the ‘Fear’ zone. This subtle shift begs the question: is this the first sign of a sentiment thaw, or just a temporary blip in a fearful market? What Exactly Is the Crypto Fear & Greed Index? Think of the Crypto Fear & Greed Index as the market’s mood ring. Created by data provider Alternative.me, it quantifies the emotional state of cryptocurrency investors on a simple scale from 0 to 100. A score of 0 screams ‘Extreme Fear,’ while 100 shouts ‘Extreme Greed.’ The current score of 28 tells us that, despite the recent uptick, apprehension still dominates trading floors and online forums. This tool is invaluable because it helps cut through the noise of daily price swings to reveal the underlying emotional driver. How Is This Crucial Index Calculated? The index isn’t based on a gut feeling. It’s a data-driven model that synthesizes information from six key market areas. This multi-source approach ensures a balanced and comprehensive view of sentiment. Volatility (25%): Sharp price drops increase fear, while stability can foster greed. Market Volume (25%): High volume during rallies suggests greed; high volume during sell-offs indicates fear. Social Media (15%): The tone and volume of conversations on platforms like Twitter and Reddit. Surveys (15%): Direct polling of market participants. Bitcoin Dominance (10%): Rising dominance often signals a ‘flight to safety’ and fear. Google Trends (10%): Search volume for terms like ‘Bitcoin crash’ or ‘buy crypto.’ Why Should You Care About a Score of 28? A reading of 28 on the Crypto Fear & Greed Index is more than just a number. For savvy investors, it represents a specific market phase. Historically, prolonged periods of extreme fear have often preceded significant buying opportunities. This is based on the contrarian investment principle: be fearful when others are greedy, and greedy when others are fearful. Therefore, while ‘Fear’ sounds negative, it can signal a market that is potentially oversold and due for a correction upward. However, it’s not a standalone buy signal. It must be used in conjunction with fundamental and technical analysis. Actionable Insights from the Current Fear Zone So, what does a fearful market mean for your portfolio? First, it suggests caution is still the prevailing wisdom. However, the two-point rise to 28 could indicate that the peak of panic may have passed. For long-term investors, this environment can be ideal for dollar-cost averaging—systematically investing a fixed amount at regular intervals regardless of price. This strategy reduces the impact of volatility. For traders, it’s a reminder to manage risk tightly, as sentiment-driven markets can reverse quickly. Always remember, the Crypto Fear & Greed Index is a tool for context, not a crystal ball. Conclusion: Navigating the Market’s Emotional Waves In summary, the Crypto Fear & Greed Index rising to 28 offers a nuanced view. The market is still fearful, but the slight improvement hints at a fragile hope. Understanding this sentiment gauge empowers you to separate emotion from strategy. By recognizing when fear is pervasive, you can make more disciplined, less reactive decisions. The true power lies not in following the crowd’s emotion, but in understanding it. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q: Who creates the Crypto Fear & Greed Index? A: The index is compiled and published by the data analytics website Alternative.me. Q: How often is the index updated? A: It is updated daily, providing a near real-time snapshot of market sentiment. Q: Is a ‘Fear’ reading always a good time to buy? A: Not necessarily. While it can indicate potential opportunity, it should not be used in isolation. Always conduct your own research and consider market fundamentals. Q: Does the index only track Bitcoin? A> While Bitcoin is a major component (via its dominance metric), the index factors in broader market data like volatility and social media, making it a gauge for the overall crypto market sentiment. Q: Where can I check the current Crypto Fear & Greed Index score? A: You can find it on the Alternative.me website or on many major cryptocurrency data platforms.

During this meeting, they expressed differing viewpoints on the effective ways the Securities and Exchange Commission should employ to oversee tokenization and the role decentralized finance (DeFi) should play in this process. This topic of discussion in the meeting was raised at a time when tokenization is rapidly gaining popularity among individuals. Some of the executives who were present at the meeting were from firms such as Citadel Securities , Coinbase, and Galaxy. Notably, tokenization refers to converting various types of assets, particularly real-world ones, into digital representations and placing them on the blockchain. Tokenization has emerged as a transformative trend in finance, enabling fractional ownership of assets ranging from equities and bonds to real estate and fine art. By representing these assets digitally on blockchain networks, investors can trade and access them with greater transparency and speed, reducing reliance on traditional intermediaries. As a result, both established financial institutions and crypto-native firms are increasingly exploring tokenized markets. The role of this panel is to guide the commission on regulations and what matters most to investors. The SEC’s meeting ignites debates in the industry Once the SEC Investor Advisory Committee meeting concluded, Samara Cohen, a senior managing director and global head of market development at BlackRock, summarized the various viewpoints highlighted during the meeting. She began by acknowledging that the presence of a six-person panel was useful in demonstrating “distinct paths and perspectives.” According to Cohen, these varying viewpoints highlighted the current problems in the industry and suggested the likelihood of more than one solution, making it an important aspect of the meeting. The SEC meeting was held just one day after some crypto enthusiasts responded negatively to a letter submitted by Citadel Securities on Wednesday this week. Following their response, the big market maker faced criticism online from certain individuals in the crypto community. This criticism arose after the market maker proposed that the SEC implement stricter regulations on decentralized finance concerning tokenized securities. When reporters reached out to Citadel Securities for comment on the matter, the American market-making firm mentioned there is an urgency for the agency to clearly identify all intermediaries participating in the trading of tokenized US stocks. This included decentralized trading protocols. They also urged against giving broad exemptions from legal definitions of “exchange” and “broker-dealer.” Other members of the crypto industry have also weighed in on Citadel Securities’ argument. These crypto supporters disagreed with this stance, arguing that such a position is “unworkable.” According to their argument, decentralized finance operates differently from traditional finance, as it does not utilize direct intermediaries, making it challenging to adhere to the same regulations. Jonah Platt argues the need for a rule-by-rule approach in the crypto industry Jonah Platt, managing director and US head of government and regulatory policy at Citadel Securities, mentioned that “To be clear, we think that tokenizing US equities has great potential and can further benefit investors.” However, he cautioned that providing a broad-ranging exemption for DeFi could harm investors within the ecosystem. Therefore, to address this situation, Platt suggested that the effective way is to identify unreasonable rules present and work on changing them. “But the idea of simply granting sweeping exemptions without analyzing each rule seems very risky to us because the US equity market is so crucial — we should ensure we get this right,” he added. Regarding his remarks, Scott Bauguess, Vice President for Global Regulatory Policy at Coinbase, chose to comment on the topic of discussion. Bauguess expressed his agreement with Platt’s rule-by-rule approach. Based on his perspective, this approach is necessary for the ecosystem; however, he pointed out that the regulations for decentralized exchanges should not be identical to those for brokers.

The project has destroyed a staggering $80 million worth of ASTER tokens from its dedicated buyback wallet. This decisive action, first reported by Solid Intel, follows the official launch of its Stage 4 buyback program on December 2nd. For investors and DeFi enthusiasts, this move raises a crucial question: what does burning such a huge sum really mean for the future of ASTER? What Does It Mean When Aster Burns $80M in ASTER Tokens? Simply put, a token burn is a permanent removal of coins from circulation. Think of it as a company buying back its own shares and then destroying them. Therefore, when Aster burns $80M in ASTER tokens , it actively reduces the total available supply. This is a common strategy in crypto to create scarcity, which, according to basic economic principles, can support the price of the remaining tokens if demand holds steady or increases. Breaking Down the Stage 4 Buyback Program The recent burn is not an isolated event. It is a direct result of Aster’s pre-announced Stage 4 buyback initiative. Here’s how such a program typically works: Revenue Generation: The exchange earns fees from trades on its platform. Fund Allocation: A portion of this revenue is allocated to a special “buyback wallet.” Token Acquisition & Destruction: The funds in this wallet are used to purchase ASTER tokens from the open market, which are then sent to a verifiable “burn address”—a wallet from which they can never be retrieved. This process creates a positive feedback loop: more trading activity generates more fees, which fuels more buybacks and burns, potentially increasing the value of each remaining token. Why Would a Project Destroy Its Own Tokens? You might wonder why a project would willingly destroy millions of dollars in assets. The rationale is strategic and aims to build long-term trust. The decision for Aster to burn $80M in ASTER tokens sends several powerful signals to the market: Confidence in Sustainability: It shows the project is generating real revenue and is financially healthy enough to forgo this capital. Commitment to Token Holders: It aligns the project’s success directly with the token’s value, benefiting long-term supporters. Combating Inflation: It counteracts the inflationary effect of new tokens that might be released as rewards or incentives. In essence, it’s a move designed to transition the token from a mere utility asset to a deflationary store of value within its ecosystem. The Potential Impact and Key Considerations While the theory behind a burn is sound, the real-world impact depends on several factors. A successful token burn like this can boost investor sentiment and attract new attention. However, it is not a magic bullet. The fundamental health of the Aster exchange—its user growth, trading volume, and product innovation—remains the ultimate driver of value. A burn amplifies positive fundamentals but cannot compensate for a weak product. Conclusion: A Calculated Gamble for Long-Term Growth Aster’s dramatic move to burn $80 million in tokens is a bold statement of self-belief. It demonstrates a shift from pure growth to sustainable value creation, putting its capital where its mouth is. While the immediate market reaction can vary, this strategic reduction in supply places a stronger foundation beneath the ASTER token. The success of this bold move will ultimately be judged by the platform’s ability to continue growing and justifying the increased scarcity it has engineered. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q: What is a token burn? A: A token burn is the permanent removal of cryptocurrency tokens from circulation by sending them to an unrecoverable wallet address, reducing the total supply. Q: Why did Aster burn $80M in tokens? A: Aster burned the tokens as part of its Stage 4 buyback program to reduce supply, create scarcity, and potentially increase the value of the remaining ASTER tokens, demonstrating confidence in its revenue model. Q: Does a token burn guarantee the price will go up? A: No, it does not guarantee a price increase. While it reduces supply, the price ultimately depends on market demand, overall sentiment, and the project’s continued success and utility. Q: Where can I verify that the Aster token burn happened? A: You can verify the transaction on a blockchain explorer by looking up the burn address or the buyback wallet address mentioned in Aster’s official announcements. Q: What is a buyback program in crypto? A: A buyback program is when a project uses its revenue or treasury funds to purchase its own tokens from the open market, often followed by burning them or locking them away. Q: How does this benefit ASTER token holders? A: Existing holders benefit from a reduced supply, which can lead to increased scarcity and potential price appreciation if demand remains constant or grows. It also shows the project is investing in the token’s long-term value. Found this deep dive into Aster’s major token burn insightful?

A massive batch of Bitcoin options expire , representing a staggering $3.4 billion in notional value. This event, scheduled for 8:00 a.m. UTC on December 5th, is a key moment that could influence short-term price action and trader sentiment across the entire digital asset space. What Happens When $3.4B in Bitcoin Options Expire? When options contracts reach their expiration date, holders must decide to exercise their right to buy or sell, or let the contract become worthless. This large-scale expiry creates a focal point for market forces. Data from leading exchange Deribit shows this batch has a put/call ratio of 0.91 and a “max pain” price of $91,000. But what do these terms actually mean for you? Put/Call Ratio (0.91): This metric shows nearly equal numbers of put (bet on price drop) and call (bet on price rise) options. A ratio below 1.0 often indicates a slightly more bullish sentiment among options traders. Max Pain Price ($91,000): This is the price at which the maximum number of options would expire worthless, causing the most financial “pain” to options buyers. It can act as a temporary gravitational pull for the spot price. Ethereum Joins the Expiry Frenzy It’s not just Bitcoin in the spotlight. A significant $660 million in Ethereum options are set to expire simultaneously. These contracts show a put/call ratio of 0.78 and a max pain price of $3,050. The lower put/call ratio suggests options traders for ETH are exhibiting even stronger bullish leanings compared to BTC ahead of this expiry event. This dual expiry creates a compounded effect on the market. Large traders and institutions with positions in both assets may execute coordinated hedging or closing strategies, potentially increasing volatility. Therefore, watching both markets is crucial today. How Could This Options Expiry Impact Bitcoin’s Price? The immediate impact of an options expire event often revolves around the max pain price. Market makers—the entities that provide liquidity—often hedge their risk by buying or selling the underlying asset. As expiry approaches, they may unwind these positions, which can push the spot price toward the max pain level to minimize their own losses. However, this is not a guaranteed rule. Strong external news or overwhelming spot market buying/selling pressure can easily override this effect. The key takeaway is to expect potentially heightened volatility and watch for unusual trading volume around the 8:00 a.m. UTC mark as positions are settled. Actionable Insights for Crypto Traders Navigating an options expire day requires a calm strategy. First, avoid making impulsive trades based solely on the expiry. Use it as one data point among many. Second, monitor trading volume and order book depth on major spot exchanges. Third, remember that the market’s reaction is often most pronounced in the hours immediately before and after the expiry time. For long-term investors, these events are typically noise. Short-term traders, however, should be aware of the potential for rapid price swings and ensure their risk management—like stop-loss orders—is firmly in place. Conclusion: A Pivotal Moment for Market Sentiment Today’s multi-billion dollar Bitcoin options expire is more than just a derivatives settlement. It acts as a live stress test for current market sentiment and liquidity. The resulting price action will offer valuable clues about the balance of power between bulls and bears. While the max pain price provides a theoretical focal point, the true direction will be determined by the broader market’s conviction. By understanding the mechanics, traders can observe this event not with anxiety, but with informed perspective. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q: What does ‘notional value’ mean in options? A: Notional value is the total value of the underlying asset controlled by the options contracts. The $3.4B figure is calculated by multiplying the number of contracts by the strike price, not the premium paid. Q: Is a put/call ratio of 0.91 bullish or bearish? A: Generally, a ratio below 1.0 (more calls than puts) is considered bullish for options market sentiment, while a ratio above 1.0 is considered bearish. Q: What happens to options that expire “in the money”? A: Options that are in-the-money (ITM) are typically automatically exercised by the exchange, meaning the holder of a call option will buy the asset, and the holder of a put option will sell it, at the agreed strike price. Q: Can retail traders influence the max pain price? A> It’s highly unlikely. The max pain price is primarily influenced by large institutions and market makers who hold significant opposing positions and engage in complex hedging activities. Q: How often do these large Bitcoin options expire? A: Major quarterly and monthly expiry events like this one happen regularly, often on the last Friday of the month or at the end of a quarter, and are closely watched by the market.

Alongside the familiar streams of foreign exchange rates and stock indices, you now see a new, dynamic data point: the live price of Bitcoin. This is the new reality at Woori Bank, marking a pivotal moment for institutional adoption in Asia. The integration of a Woori Bank Bitcoin price feed into its main dealing room isn’t just a minor update; it’s a powerful signal that digital assets are becoming part of the mainstream financial fabric. What Does Woori Bank’s Bitcoin Move Really Mean? According to a report by Maeil Business Newspaper, South Korea’s Woori Bank has begun displaying Bitcoin prices on the primary display board of its Seoul dealing room. This board is the central nervous system for traders, where critical market data converges. Therefore, placing Bitcoin alongside the Korean Won, US Dollar, and KOSPI index grants it unprecedented legitimacy within a traditional financial institution. This move is far from isolated. It reflects a strategic shift among South Korea’s financial giants. For instance, just days earlier on December 3rd, Hana Financial Group partnered with Dunamu, the operator of the Upbit exchange, to explore blockchain for services like overseas remittances. Together, these actions paint a clear picture: major banks are no longer just observing crypto—they are actively engaging with it. Why Is This a Game-Changer for Institutional Adoption? The Woori Bank Bitcoin price feed serves multiple crucial purposes. First, it normalizes cryptocurrency as a legitimate asset class for institutional investors and corporate clients. Second, it provides essential real-time data for banks that may be considering: Custody services for digital assets. Creating Bitcoin-linked investment products . Facilitating corporate treasury diversification into crypto. Moreover, this visibility reduces the knowledge gap. Bankers and traders can monitor Bitcoin’s volatility and correlations with traditional markets in real-time, fostering a deeper, data-driven understanding. This practical exposure is often the first step toward more substantive financial products and services. What Challenges Do Traditional Banks Face with Crypto? While the trend is promising, integration is not without hurdles. Regulatory clarity in South Korea, though improving, remains a complex landscape for traditional finance entities. Banks must navigate strict anti-money laundering (AML) and know-your-customer (KYC) requirements in a digital asset context. Furthermore, the inherent volatility of Bitcoin poses risk management challenges. Banks are inherently risk-averse institutions. Therefore, adopting crypto requires robust new frameworks for valuation, security, and compliance. The Woori Bank Bitcoin display can be seen as a low-risk, high-impact first step—testing the waters by integrating data before moving to hold assets or execute trades. What Can We Learn from This Trend? The actionable insight here is clear: institutional adoption is becoming a practical reality, not just a theoretical discussion. For investors, this signals growing long-term confidence in the crypto infrastructure. For the industry, it underscores the importance of building bridges with regulated entities. South Korea, with its tech-savvy population and high crypto engagement, is becoming a leading indicator. When major banks like Woori take visible steps, it often precedes a wave of similar actions globally. The focus is shifting from “if” to “how” traditional finance will incorporate digital assets. Conclusion: A Defining Moment for Finance The addition of a Woori Bank Bitcoin price feed is a small change with massive implications. It represents the quiet erosion of the wall between traditional and digital finance. This move, coupled with Hana Bank’s blockchain partnership, confirms that South Korea’s financial leaders are not waiting on the sidelines. They are preparing for a future where cryptocurrency is a standard component of a diversified financial ecosystem. The message to the world is unmistakable: institutional adoption is accelerating, and the landscape of finance is changing for good. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What exactly did Woori Bank do with Bitcoin? A1: Woori Bank started displaying the live Bitcoin price on the main data screen in its central dealing room in Seoul, alongside traditional data like forex rates and stock indices. Q2: Why is displaying a Bitcoin price feed significant? A2: It legitimizes Bitcoin as a serious financial asset within a conservative institution, provides crucial data for potential services, and signals broader institutional acceptance. Q3: Is Woori Bank trading or holding Bitcoin? A3: The report only confirms the display of price data. This is typically a first step before a bank offers custody, trading, or investment products related to cryptocurrencies. Q4: Are other South Korean banks involved in crypto? A4: Yes. For example, Hana Financial Group recently signed a deal with Upbit’s operator, Dunamu, to apply blockchain technology to banking services like international remittances. Q5: What does this mean for the average crypto investor? A5: It indicates growing institutional confidence, which can lead to more stability, new investment products, and broader mainstream acceptance of cryptocurrencies over time. Q6: What are the main hurdles for banks adopting crypto? A6: Key challenges include navigating evolving regulations, managing the asset’s volatility, and implementing strong security and compliance (AML/KYC) frameworks for digital assets.

Although SOL is a prominent name in the space, traders are now increasingly wondering if its next leg up is going to be as explosive as its previous instances, especially when faced with growing competition and the onset of new money entering the space to move towards newer assets that have greater asymmetry. This is now creating a new space for newer assets to enter, and one name that’s quickly moving up the list is that of Mutuum Finance (MUTM) . Available for a mere $0.035, this latest new crypto coin is now rallying heavily on analysts’ suggestions of a possible 50x increase, fueled by a rapidly growing base and a nearly complete presale event. With above $19.1 million, raised for its purpose-driven DeFi structure, MUTM is now increasingly being touted to be the top crypto of the current cycle, capable of overcoming even the most prominent giants of the crypto world in its next leg up. Solana Price Analysis: Short-Term Volatility & Long-Term Stability Solana’s price has registered significant short-term volatility, oscillating between $135 and $138. Notably, there was a sudden spike and then a plummet, representing a reaction to market dynamics that can be attributed to short-term trading activities or news events. However, reviewing the price trend, which is reflected at the bottom of the graph, there have been minimal positive trends since 2023, implying that although there is short-term volatility, Solana’s price trend is actually reflected within a positive range that represents its intrinsic value. Phase 6 Presale Almost Finished Amid High Demand The presale of Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is gathering even more momentum as Phase 6 draws closer to an end. Made to cater to different pricing levels and allocation sizes, the ongoing presale has continuously offered early supporters lower entry costs. Although its initial price was only $0.01 set for Phase 1, the price of MUTM is now at $0.035 for Phase 6, a 250% increase from where it all began. Thus far, the presale has managed to accumulate a total of $19.1 million, and the number of holders within the community now exceeds 18,310. Given that Phase 6 is now 95% sold out, the available supply at this price is extremely limited. In fact, Phase 7 is set to bring a price increase of 20%, making this current phase the last opportunity to acquire MUTM at $0.035. This makes $MUTM one of the most sought-after top crypto opportunities available and the most attractive new crypto coin for early adoption before the next phase begins. Creating a Comprehensive DeFi Ecosystem Mutuum Finance is a fully decentralized liquidity protocol. It enables users to lend, borrow, and interact with on-chain markets, giving them complete control of their assets. It uses a dual lending system that provides flexibility, ease of access, and efficiency to its users. The operation of the Peer-to-Contract (P2C) system is made possible through pooled liquidity markets, where contributors can lock their assets to earn mtTokens, proportionate to the asset value, that is, 1:1. The purpose of these tokens is to act as yield-bearing receipts, such that their value escalates as a result of borrowed money from the liquidity pool. When it comes to non-core assets that may not be suitable for conventional pooled market assets, Mutuum Finance supports a Peer-to-Peer lending platform. Through this platform, users can create a separate contract for non-standard or highly volatile assets, thus enhancing the asset base without undermining the stability of the liquidity pool. For those interested, one up-and-coming cryptocurrency that is well on its way to creating a decentralized future for crypto users is Mutuum Finance, going for a mere price of $0.035.

The latest data reveals a stark reality: the Altcoin Season Index is stuck at a mere 23. This critical metric, a beacon for crypto traders, continues to flash a strong signal of Bitcoin dominance , suggesting the king of crypto isn’t ready to relinquish its throne just yet. Let’s decode what this means for your portfolio and the broader market cycle. What Exactly Is the Altcoin Season Index Telling Us? CoinMarketCap’s Altcoin Season Index provides a clear, data-driven snapshot of market leadership. It works by comparing the 90-day price performance of the top 100 cryptocurrencies (excluding stablecoins) against Bitcoin itself. The magic number is 75. For a true “altcoin season” to be declared, at least 75% of these major altcoins must outperform Bitcoin over that three-month period. A score of 23, unchanged from the previous day, is a long way from that threshold. Therefore, this low score is a powerful indicator that capital and investor confidence are still heavily concentrated in Bitcoin. Why Does Bitcoin Dominance Persist? Several key factors are contributing to the sustained Bitcoin dominance reflected in the low Altcoin Season Index . Understanding these forces is crucial for any investor. Macroeconomic Hedge: In times of economic uncertainty, investors often flock to Bitcoin as a perceived digital gold and store of value, viewing it as a safer bet than more speculative altcoins. Institutional Focus: Major financial institutions and new spot Bitcoin ETFs are primarily channeling capital into Bitcoin first, reinforcing its lead. Market Cycle Phase: Historically, Bitcoin rallies first in a new bull cycle. Its strength often needs to consolidate before capital rotates into altcoins, which typically happens later. Risk Appetite: A low index score suggests that overall market risk appetite remains cautious, favoring the relative stability of the largest crypto asset. How Can Traders Use This Information? A stagnant Altcoin Season Index is not just a news headline; it’s a tactical tool. For savvy traders, this data informs strategy. It suggests that, for now, portfolio allocation might wisely favor Bitcoin or Bitcoin-centric investments. It also helps set realistic expectations for altcoin investments, indicating that broad-based, explosive gains across the altcoin market may not be imminent. Instead, outperformance is likely to be selective and sector-specific. Monitoring this index weekly can help you spot the early signs of a shift, signaling when it might be time to rebalance. When Will the Altcoin Season Finally Arrive? This is the million-dollar question. While the Altcoin Season Index is low today, it is a dynamic metric. A shift typically requires a combination of Bitcoin price stability or consolidation, increased overall market liquidity, and a surge in investor confidence to seek higher-risk, higher-reward opportunities. Watch for the index to climb steadily past 50 and toward the critical 75 level. When it does, it could unleash a wave of opportunity across the crypto ecosystem. In conclusion, the Altcoin Season Index holding firm at 23 is a clear message from the market: patience is essential. Bitcoin’s dominance remains the defining narrative, shaping capital flows and investor behavior. While this may delay the altcoin frenzy many anticipate, it provides a disciplined framework for investment. By understanding and respecting this signal, you can navigate the current landscape with clarity and position yourself to act decisively when the index finally begins its meaningful ascent. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What is a good score on the Altcoin Season Index? A score above 75 indicates a strong altcoin season is underway. A score below 25, like the current 23, signals strong Bitcoin dominance. Q2: Does a low index mean I shouldn’t buy any altcoins? Not necessarily. It means broad, market-wide altcoin outperformance is unlikely. It’s a time for selective, research-driven investments in specific projects rather than expecting all altcoins to rise together. Q3: How often is the Altcoin Season Index updated? The index is typically updated daily, providing a near real-time pulse on the relationship between Bitcoin and altcoin performance. Q4: Has the index ever been wrong about predicting altcoin season? The index is a lagging indicator based on past 90-day performance, not a prediction. It confirms a trend that is already happening. It won’t predict the start of a season but will confirm when one has begun. Q5: Where can I check the Altcoin Season Index? The index is publicly available on CoinMarketCap’s website under their market data or research sections. Q6: Do all altcoins move based on this index? No. The index measures the top 100. Smaller, more volatile altcoins (“small-cap alts”) can experience rallies independently, but sustained, major capital rotation is signaled by this index.

Ethereum Sharks Have Added 450,000 ETH Since Mid-November According to data from on-chain analytics firm Santiment, the supply of the Ethereum sharks has gone up recently. The indicator of relevance here is the “Supply Distribution,” measuring the total amount of tokens that a given wallet group as a whole is holding right now. Related Reading: Next Key XRP Level Could Be $1.2 If Current Support Fails, Says Analyst In the context of the current topic, the cohort of focus is the one corresponding to a coin range of 1,000 to 10,000 ETH. At the current exchange rate, the lower bound of the range roughly converts to $3.2 million and the upper one to $32 million. Investors of this large size are popularly known as the sharks. While not as massive as the whales (addresses with more than 10,000 ETH), the sharks are still considered influential entities. This can make their behavior often worth keeping an eye on. As the chart below, shared by Santiment, suggests, the latest Ethereum shark behavior has been one of accumulation. During the November price decline, the Supply Distribution had been going down for the Ethereum sharks, but around the time of the market bottom, its trend began to reverse. Between November 18th and December 2nd, the sharks added a total of 450,000 ETH (worth about $1.4 billion) to their wallets, a massive amount. Alongside this sharp uptick in the metric, ETH went through its price recovery. The cryptocurrency’s sharp retrace to start December didn’t dissuade these large hands, either, as their supply only continued to rise. This may be one of the factors behind the quick resumption of bullish momentum that the asset has seen. Another bullish factor has been the trend in the Network Growth, another on-chain indicator displayed in the chart. This metric measures the daily number of addresses that are coming online on the Ethereum network for the first time. A wallet is considered “online” when it participates in transaction activity on the blockchain, so the Network Growth essentially tracks the addresses making their very first transfer. From the graph, it’s visible that this Ethereum metric has also surged recently, hitting a peak value of 190,000 addresses. Generally, a surge in network activity is usually a positive sign for any rally’s sustainability, as it implies that the network is able to attract fresh attention.

It now remains to be seen whether the sharks will continue to buy in the near future and if investor FOMO will remain at healthy levels. ETH Price At the time of writing, Ethereum is floating around $3,185, up more than 5% over the last seven days.

Bitcoin Bear Market Incoming? Sharing a composite on-chain dashboard overlaid on the BTC price, Ju wrote on X: “Most Bitcoin on-chain indicators are bearish. Without macro liquidity, we enter a bear cycle.” The chart stacks ten CryptoQuant metrics behind the price in a red-to-green heatmap from 2021 to 2025, highlighting how regime shifts in prior cycles coincided with clusters of bearish readings. Related Reading: US Sen. Lummis Hints At US Bitcoin Buy With ‘Franklin’ Meme The indicators in the panel include the MVRV Z-score, CryptoQuant P&L Index, the Bull-Bear Cycle Indicator, Inter-Exchange Flow Pulse, Network Activity Index, Stablecoin Liquidity, Bitcoin Demand Growth, Trader On-chain Profit Margin, Trader Realized Price and a Technical Signal metric. When the majority are bullish, the backdrop turns light green; when they flip bearish, it shifts to red. In the latest section of the chart, as BTC has pulled back from its highs, red once again dominates – the visual basis for Ju’s warning. For the next major move, Ju argues that on-chain data is now subordinate to macro conditions and ETF flows. Quoting his own post, he wrote: “It is simple. If you think macro gets better next year, you buy. Otherwise, you sell. I’m not a macro expert, so find macro bros. New ETF inflows are the key.” That line pinpoints what he believes can “save” Bitcoin from a deeper drawdown: renewed demand from spot ETFs as a conduit for institutional capital. In earlier stages of the cycle, rising ETF inflows coincided with strong price appreciation; more recently, slowing or negative flows have mirrored the loss of upward momentum. Ju frames the current environment as one that demands flexible scenario management rather than rigid forecasts. “At this stage, it is more about being reactive than predictive. Set your scenarios and trade accordingly,” he told followers. The composite chart is designed for exactly that purpose, showing how past bull tops and bear markets aligned with persistent stretches of red across profit, valuation and liquidity metrics. Related Reading: Bitcoin And The 2026 Fed Shift: Expert Says Markets Aren’t Ready Despite the bearish tilt, Ju does not foresee a repeat of the 2022 collapse, when Bitcoin fell roughly 65% from peak to trough. He cites the behaviour of Michael Saylor led Strategy as a stabilizing factor. “If Strategy holds its 650K BTC this cycle (or sells only a little), we would not see another -65% drawdown like in 2022,” he wrote. In his view, that supply remaining largely off the market reduces the probability of a violent deleveraging event. Ju characterizes the current pullback as substantial but not extreme in historical context. “We are about -25% from ATH now, and even if a bear cycle comes, the downside would likely be smaller and look more like a broad sideways range,” he argued, suggesting that prolonged consolidation is more likely than a single dramatic crash. His message to long-term investors is explicitly calming. “Long-term holders should avoid panic selling,” he advised. While cyclical on-chain indicators flash red, he insists the structural backdrop has improved: “Bitcoin has more liquidity channels now, so the long-term outlook is obviously strong, imo.” Those channels include ETFs and a deeper institutional market structure than in prior cycles. At press time, Bitcoin traded at $92,494.

The Chicago Tribune’s lawsuit against Perplexity AI represents more than just another copyright case; it’s a watershed moment for AI search engines and their relationship with traditional publishers. For crypto enthusiasts watching decentralized content platforms evolve, this legal showdown reveals the complex terrain where artificial intelligence meets intellectual property rights. Why the Chicago Tribune is Suing Perplexity AI On December 4, 2025, the Chicago Tribune filed a federal lawsuit in New York against Perplexity AI, alleging systematic copyright infringement. According to court documents reviewed by Bitcoin World, the newspaper claims Perplexity’s AI search engine is improperly using Tribune content without permission or compensation. This legal action follows similar lawsuits against OpenAI and Microsoft filed earlier in 2025 by MediaNews Group and Tribune Publishing, which owns the Chicago Tribune. The core allegations include: Unauthorized use of Tribune content in Perplexity’s Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) systems Bypassing the newspaper’s paywall through Perplexity’s Comet browser Delivering verbatim or near-verbatim summaries of protected articles Scraping content without proper licensing agreements The RAG Systems Controversy: AI’s Copyright Achilles Heel Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) represents a significant advancement in AI technology designed to reduce hallucinations by grounding responses in verified data sources. However, the Chicago Tribune’s lawsuit specifically targets this technology as the primary mechanism of alleged infringement. The newspaper argues that Perplexity’s RAG systems are essentially sophisticated content scrapers that repurpose journalistic work without proper attribution or compensation. This legal challenge raises fundamental questions: Technology Purpose Legal Challenge RAG Systems Improve accuracy by using verified sources Alleged unauthorized content use Comet Browser Enhanced AI-powered browsing Paywall circumvention claims AI Summarization Condense information for users Copyright infringement allegations Perplexity AI’s Growing Legal Challenges The Chicago Tribune lawsuit isn’t an isolated incident for Perplexity AI. The company faces mounting legal pressure from multiple directions: Reddit Lawsuit (October 2025): Alleging unauthorized use of forum content Dow Jones Case: Similar copyright infringement claims Amazon Cease and Desist: Threats over AI browser shopping features Media Industry Pattern: 17 publications sued OpenAI/Microsoft in April 2025 What makes this wave of litigation particularly significant for the crypto community is the parallel with blockchain-based content platforms. As decentralized media projects develop their own AI integrations, the outcomes of these cases could establish crucial precedents for how AI interacts with protected content in Web3 environments. Copyright Infringement: The Legal Battlefield Expands The Chicago Tribune’s legal strategy reveals a sophisticated understanding of AI technology. Rather than focusing solely on model training—the subject of many previous AI lawsuits—the newspaper is targeting the operational systems that deliver content to users. This approach could have far-reaching implications for how AI companies design their products and services. Key legal arguments in the case: Whether RAG systems constitute “fair use” or require licensing If paywall bypassing violates terms of service and copyright law How courts will define “non-verbatim factual summaries” versus infringement The liability of AI companies for how their systems retrieve and present content AI Search Engine Legal Precedents in the Making This lawsuit arrives at a critical juncture for AI search engines. As these platforms become more sophisticated in how they access and present information, the legal framework governing their operations remains uncertain. The Chicago Tribune case could help establish important boundaries that will shape the future of AI-powered search. For cryptocurrency projects developing similar technologies, several considerations emerge: Content licensing models for AI training and retrieval Transparency in data sourcing and usage Technical measures to respect access controls and paywalls Revenue sharing models with content creators FAQs: Understanding the Legal Landscape What is Perplexity AI? Perplexity AI is an artificial intelligence search engine that uses advanced language models to provide conversational answers to user queries. Unlike traditional search engines that return links, Perplexity generates direct responses while citing sources. What is Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG)? RAG is a technique that enhances AI responses by retrieving information from external knowledge sources before generating answers. This approach aims to improve accuracy and reduce “hallucinations”—incorrect information generated by AI models. Who is involved in these lawsuits? Chicago Tribune : A major American daily newspaper based in Chicago, Illinois. Perplexity AI : An AI search engine company facing multiple copyright lawsuits. OpenAI : Previously sued by the same publishing group in April 2025. Microsoft : Co-defendant with OpenAI in the earlier lawsuit. How does this affect cryptocurrency projects? Many blockchain projects are developing AI integrations or content platforms. The legal precedents established in these cases could influence how decentralized applications handle content licensing, attribution, and compensation in AI-driven environments. The Bottom Line: A Turning Point for AI and Content The Chicago Tribune’s lawsuit against Perplexity AI represents more than a simple copyright dispute—it’s a fundamental challenge to how AI systems access and utilize protected content. As artificial intelligence becomes increasingly integrated into search and information retrieval, establishing clear legal boundaries becomes essential for both innovation and rights protection. For the cryptocurrency and blockchain community, these legal battles offer crucial insights into the evolving relationship between technology and content rights. As decentralized platforms explore AI integrations, understanding these legal parameters will be essential for building sustainable, compliant systems that respect intellectual property while leveraging artificial intelligence’s capabilities.

This year’s flagship event in Las Vegas moved beyond simple AI assistants, declaring a new era where AI agents work independently for days, learn from your team, and drive tangible business returns. For the crypto and tech communities watching, the implications are profound, signaling a massive infrastructure shift that could power the next generation of decentralized applications and intelligent platforms. The focus was squarely on giving enterprise AI customers unprecedented control and customization. AWS re:Invent 2025 Declares the Age of the AI Agent The opening keynote from AWS CEO Matt Garman set the tone, asserting that AI agents represent the “true value” of artificial intelligence investments. “AI assistants are starting to give way to AI agents that can perform tasks and automate on your behalf,” Garman stated. This wasn’t just theoretical; the conference was packed with product announcements designed to make this a reality. Swami Sivasubramanian, VP of Agentic AI at AWS, captured the bullish sentiment: “Agents give you the freedom to build without limits, accelerating how quickly you can go from idea to impact.” The core promise of AWS re:Invent 2025 was to provide the tools that turn this promise into a daily operational reality for businesses worldwide. Frontier Agents: Your New Autonomous Teammates AWS introduced three groundbreaking “Frontier agents,” designed to operate with significant autonomy. The standout is the Kiro autonomous agent, a coding assistant that learns a team’s patterns and can then work independently for hours or even days. This moves far beyond code completion into the realm of a persistent, learning software engineer. The other agents target critical enterprise functions: Security Agent: Automates code reviews and security audits. DevOps Agent: Manages deployments and works to prevent incidents when pushing new code live. These agents are available in preview, marking a concrete step toward the agentic future AWS is championing. Supercharging Enterprise AI with New Chips and Systems Underpinning these advanced AI capabilities is a new generation of hardware. AWS made significant announcements on the AI chips front, crucial for anyone building compute-intensive applications like AI model training or blockchain validation. Chip/System Key Feature Performance Claim Graviton5 CPU 192 processor cores, reduced inter-core latency Highest performance and efficiency yet for general compute Trainium3 AI Chip Next-gen training & inference chip 4x performance gain, 40% lower energy use UltraServer AI System Runs Trainium3 chips Designed for massive-scale AI workloads AI Factory On-premises AWS AI system (with Nvidia/ Trainium3) Addresses data sovereignty for governments & corporations A critical teaser was that the already-in-development Trainium4 will feature compatibility with Nvidia’s chips, a strategic move acknowledging the heterogeneous reality of modern enterprise AI infrastructure. Building Smarter: Tools for Custom LLMs and Agent Control For enterprises wanting to build their own intelligence, AWS unveiled major upgrades to its developer platforms. The goal is to simplify the creation of custom LLMs and governable agents. Amazon SageMaker AI: Now includes serverless model customization, allowing developers to start building without managing underlying infrastructure. Amazon Bedrock: Introduced Reinforcement Fine Tuning, offering preset workflows to automate the customization process from start to finish. AgentCore Platform: Enhanced with “Policy” features for setting agent boundaries, memory capabilities for user context, and 13 prebuilt evaluation systems. These tools lower the barrier to entry for creating specialized, secure, and effective AI solutions tailored to unique business data and processes. The Human Element: Werner Vogels’ Final Bow and the Job Question In an emotional closing keynote, Amazon CTO Dr. Werner Vogels announced this would be his final re:Invent presentation after 14 years. He directly addressed the elephant in the room: “Will AI take my job? Maybe… We should rephrase… Will AI make me obsolete? Absolutely not, if you evolve.” His message was one of empowerment, urging developers to see AI as a tool for augmentation rather than replacement. This human-centric perspective was a vital counterbalance to the wave of automation news, emphasizing that the future belongs to those who learn to collaborate with these new AI agents . Real Impact and Cost Savings The conference wasn’t just about future promises. Customer stories and immediate cost-saving measures highlighted present-day value: Lyft reported using an AI agent built with Anthropic’s Claude on Bedrock to handle driver/rider issues, cutting average resolution time by 87% and increasing driver usage by 70%. AWS launched Database Savings Plans , offering up to 35% cost reduction for committed database usage, a move hailed by cloud economists after years of customer requests. Amazon is offering a year of free credits for its Kiro coding agent to eligible early-stage startups, aiming to win developer mindshare. Conclusion: A Foundation for the Next Decade of Innovation AWS re:Invent 2025 was a definitive pivot from talking about AI to building the operational framework for it. By focusing on autonomous agents, powerful and efficient AI chips , and tools for creating custom LLMs , AWS is providing the building blocks for the next wave of enterprise AI applications. For the tech and crypto ecosystems, these advancements mean more accessible, powerful, and sovereign compute resources. The ability to run AI factories on-premises and train models on proprietary data securely opens new doors for innovation in fintech, DeFi, and beyond.

Tom Lee of BitMine said on TV that Bitcoin gained nearly 20% in the weeks following the last time the Fed shifted away from QT. He noted that the same setup might lead to more upside before the year ends. Many traders are watching how much money returns to markets because it can shape short-term sentiment. ETF Flows And Long-Term Views According to reports, new XRP ETFs have already attracted more than $800 million in inflows. Supporters say these inflows can change how investors view XRP, although they don’t remove all uncertainty. Some hedge fund managers also weighed in, pointing out that over the past 16 years the Fed added close to $9 trillion in liquidity while only removing $3.2 trillion before reversing course. Utility Tokens May Get More Attention Some community voices argue that tokens built for payments or settlement may see stronger demand if liquidity continues to rise. One XRP supporter said XRP was made to move money at scale and claimed the market will focus more on assets with real use cases. Adoption remains mixed. Some companies that previously used Ripple’s tools have stepped back, while others still rely on parts of its payment network. The XRP Ledger is being used, but not always in the same way it was during earlier partnerships.

55371755,639985,1764900020,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/55371755.jpeg,"Bitcoin Enters New Adoption Phase: Vanguard, Schwab, and Japan Fuel BTC Recovery",https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-enters-adoption-phase-vanguard-schwab-japan/,"Bitcoin has climbed back above $93,000 after enduring days of intense selling pressure, heightened volatility, and widespread market uncertainty. The recovery marks a significant shift in sentiment, but according to a new report from CryptoQuant, one signal stands out as the primary driver behind the rebound: institutional capital is quietly flowing back into the market. The analysis highlights a key metric— the Coinbase Premium Index, long regarded as a reliable proxy for US institutional demand. Throughout November’s steep correction, the premium plunged deep into negative territory, revealing a stark imbalance: US spot buyers were far weaker than their offshore counterparts. During this phase, as Bitcoin slid below $90,000, the sharp drop in the premium reflected clear risk-off positioning among US-regulated investors, many of whom stepped back or took profits amid rising macro uncertainty. Now, with Bitcoin recovering key levels, the data shows early signs of renewed accumulation from US-based institutions. This subtle but meaningful shift suggests that the most conservative segment of the market—professional and regulated capital —may be positioning again after the correction. If this trend continues, the rebound above $93K could evolve into a much broader shift in market structure. Institutional Catalysts Drive Bitcoin Coinbase Premium Higher According to the CryptoQuant report , the narrative has shifted decisively. The Coinbase Premium Index has climbed back into positive territory, signaling renewed accumulation from US-based institutional and regulated investors. This shift coincides with a wave of major developments reshaping the global investment landscape. Most notably, Charles Schwab, a $12 trillion asset manager, announced plans to offer Bitcoin and Ethereum trading in early 2026. This follows Vanguard’s market-moving reversal that opened access to spot crypto ETFs for more than 50 million conservative investors. These firms are not speculative players—they are the backbone of American retirement wealth. At the same time, a powerful but less publicized catalyst is emerging overseas: Japan is moving toward formal approval of Bitcoin ETFs. Given the size of Japanese investment trusts, pension-linked products, and retail participation, early adoption could inject $3–10 billion of fresh demand. While no single region drives Bitcoin’s valuation alone, combined flows from the US, Europe, and Japan could easily deliver a mid-single-digit percentage uplift to BTC in the early phases of this expansion. The broader takeaway is unmistakable: Bitcoin is transitioning from a niche risk asset into a globally standardized investment product. The return of a positive Coinbase Premium may be the market’s earliest confirmation that institutions—especially the most conservative ones—are positioning ahead of 2026. Weekly Structure Shows Early Signs of Recovery Bitcoin’s weekly chart shows a decisive rebound, with price pushing back above $93,000 after weeks of aggressive selling pressure. The recent wick down toward the green 100-week moving average (100W MA) marked a key moment: buyers stepped in precisely at long-term dynamic support, preventing a deeper breakdown toward the $80,000–$82,000 region. This reaction confirms that long-term holders and institutional buyers are protecting this level, aligning with the recent return of positive signals from the Coinbase Premium Index. Despite the rebound, the chart still shows Bitcoin facing overhead resistance. The 50-week MA sits just above the price, creating a supply zone between $97,000 and $102,000. This has historically acted as a trend-determining range; reclaiming it would shift momentum decisively back to the bulls. Until then, the market remains in a mid-cycle consolidation. Volume behavior also supports the recovery narrative. The huge sell-volume spikes seen in November marked capitulation-like behavior, which often precedes trend reversals. The recent green weekly candle forming on rising buy volume suggests that demand is returning, aligning with improving liquidity conditions on major US and global exchanges.

It marks a major step forward in cross-chain interoperability between Base and Solana. With the bridge in place, users can enjoy seamless, bidirectional asset transfers from Solana to Base , and vice versa, without needing to rely on centralized exchanges or third-party intermediaries. What’s the Base—Solana bridge? According to Base’s official X page , the Base-Solana bridge, which makes it easy for anyone to move assets across both ecosystems, is secured by Chainlink’s Cross-Chain Interoperability Protocol (CCIP), via a bespoke cross-chain oracle, alongside Coinbase. Coinbase and Chainlink CCIP are node operators, each independently verifying all messages in a bid to ensure all token transfers between Base and Solana are safe and reliable. The rollout is happening on multiple apps, including Zora, AerodromeFi, Virtuals, Flaunch, and RelayProtocol, and is available for anyone to use. Users will also be able to trade and use Solana assets on Base natively, and this covers not only standard tokens like $SOL, but also memecoins like $CHILLHOUSE, $TRENCHER, and many more. The move is ultimately designed to unlock unified liquidity pools across both ecosystems, allowing users to trade, deploy, and interact with assets from either chain in a single environment. Base’s official announcement aligns with its core vision of being a “bridge rather than island” and an “everything economy,” where “every asset, across every network, [is] available at any time.” On the other side of the bridge, the Solana network has become the first chain to get connected via this infrastructure, though there are plans in the pipeline for expansions to other networks like Avalanche and Polygon. “By leveraging Chainlink CCIP as the cross-chain infrastructure securing the Base-Solana Bridge, Base enables developers to build the most secure cross-chain applications and move the industry toward a reliable interoperability standard that is adopted by the largest financial institutions in the world,” said Johann Eid, Chief Business Officer at Chainlink Labs. “This is how onchain finance scales to securely support global markets and the hundreds of trillions in value they represent.” Base chain facilitated JPMorgan bridge with DeFi Given its lofty goal of being the “everything economy,” the recent moves have been on brand for Base. It just announced the bridge between Solana and Base, but weeks before that, it played a big role in helping JPMorgan Chase & Co. begin the rollout of its JPM Coin deposit token . The token , which enables institutional clients to settle transactions instantly and 24/7, marks a major expansion of traditional banking into public blockchain infrastructure and is based on the Base network. The token named the JPM Coin represents dollar deposits held at the bank, allowing clients to send and receive funds on Base. Unlike traditional stablecoins, JPM Coin can pay holders interest, which makes it an attractive alternative for institutions, including crypto trading firms that use stablecoins for collateral or liquidity management. By hosting both the JPM Coin and DeFi-native services, Base has the combo of supporting regulated banking tokens and permissionless financial applications, a synergy that creates a unified infrastructure under which TradFi and DeFi can coexist. The alignment also shows that more banks are increasingly experimenting with blockchain to facilitate faster, cheaper, and more accessible payments beyond traditional business hours.

In a recent announcement, the world’s leading cryptocurrency exchange took decisive action. Binance suspends deposits and withdrawals for these three specific tokens, citing network delays as the primary reason. This temporary measure, effective from 8:00 a.m. UTC on December 12, is a reminder of the technical realities behind the seamless crypto trading experience. Let’s break down what this means for your assets and why such pauses are sometimes necessary. Why Did Binance Suspend These Transactions? Binance’s decision is a proactive step, not a reactive panic. The official reason given is network delays . But what does that actually mean for you as a user? Essentially, the underlying blockchain networks for CHESS, DF, and GHST are experiencing congestion or technical slowdowns. When this happens, transactions can become stuck, take excessively long times to confirm, or even fail entirely. Therefore, by temporarily suspending the deposit and withdrawal functions, Binance protects its users from potential loss of funds. Imagine sending tokens to the exchange only for the transaction to get lost in a delayed network—you’d be left in limbo. This pause allows the network issues to be resolved, ensuring that when services resume, all movements are safe, secure, and verifiable on their respective blockchains. Which Tokens Are Affected and What Should You Do? The suspension specifically targets three assets: CHESS (the token for the Tranchess protocol), DF (dForce), and GHST (Aavegotchi). If you hold these tokens on Binance, here is what you need to know: Trading is Unaffected: You can still buy, sell, and trade these tokens against other pairs on Binance’s spot market. The suspension only applies to moving tokens on or off the exchange. Your Funds Are Safe: All existing balances of CHESS, DF, and GHST in your Binance wallets remain secure and under your control. No Action Required: For most users, no immediate action is needed. Simply wait for Binance to announce the resumption of services, which typically happens once network stability is confirmed. This is a standard operational procedure for reputable exchanges. It highlights their commitment to security over convenience, a trade-off that seasoned crypto users have come to appreciate. Understanding Network Delays in Cryptocurrency You might wonder, why do these network delays happen? Blockchain networks are not infallible. They can experience high traffic, similar to a website crashing during a sale. Sometimes, upgrades or unexpected bugs can also cause slowdowns. When an exchange like Binance detects irregular activity or confirmation times on a network, the safest course is to halt movements until the all-clear is given. This incident serves as a useful case study. It shows that even popular tokens and large exchanges are subject to the fundamental technical layers of crypto. It’s a built-in challenge of a decentralized ecosystem. However, transparent communication from the exchange, as seen here, helps manage user expectations and maintain trust. What Happens Next After Binance Suspends Deposits? The key word from Binance is “temporary.” The exchange has a track record of quickly resolving such issues. Users should monitor the official Binance Announcements channel for the service resumption notice. Typically, the process is: Binance engineers monitor the affected networks. Once network performance returns to normal and remains stable, they will conduct tests. An official announcement will be made, and deposit/withdrawal services will be re-enabled. There is no need for alarm. This is a routine operational pause designed to protect your assets. In the long run, such measures contribute to a more reliable and secure trading environment for everyone. Conclusion: A Pause for Protection, Not for Panic When Binance suspends deposits and withdrawals for specific tokens, it is exercising necessary caution. The move regarding CHESS, DF, and GHST is a textbook example of an exchange prioritizing user asset safety amidst external network instability. While momentarily inconvenient, it prevents the far greater hassle of lost or stuck transactions. It underscores the importance of choosing platforms with robust risk management protocols. As the crypto space evolves, such transparent and security-focused actions are what build enduring user confidence. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: Can I still trade CHESS, DF, and GHST on Binance? A: Yes. The suspension only affects depositing tokens into your Binance wallet and withdrawing them out. Spot trading for these tokens continues as normal. Q2: How long will the suspension last? A: Binance has not provided a specific timeline. The service will be restored once the underlying network delays are resolved and stability is confirmed. Users should check the official announcements for updates. Q3: Are my tokens safe on Binance during this time? A: Absolutely. Your existing token balances are secure in your wallet. The suspension is a preventive measure to protect funds in transit, not a security breach. Q4: What causes network delays for cryptocurrencies? A: Network delays can be caused by high transaction volume congesting the blockchain, ongoing network upgrades, or unexpected technical issues with the node infrastructure. Q5: Will this affect the price of CHESS, DF, or GHST? A: While temporary suspension of transfers can sometimes cause short-term price volatility due to reduced liquidity flow, the core trading markets remain open. The long-term price impact is typically minimal for such routine operational pauses. Q6: Has this happened before with Binance? A: Yes. It is a standard industry practice. Exchanges like Binance periodically suspend deposits and withdrawals for various tokens to perform wallet maintenance, support network upgrades, or address network instability, always with user safety in mind.

This pivotal listing, effective from 8:00 a.m. UTC today, dramatically increases SAPIEN’s accessibility and liquidity for a massive regional audience. For traders and project watchers, this is a development that demands attention. Why Does Bithumb Listing SAPIEN Matter? When a major exchange like Bithumb lists a new asset, it’s never just a routine update. It’s a powerful endorsement that can shape market trajectories. This decision signals that SAPIEN has passed rigorous due diligence, meeting the exchange’s standards for security and potential. For the project, it unlocks direct access to one of the world’s most active and retail-investor-driven crypto economies. Therefore, the immediate benefit is enhanced liquidity and easier onboarding for Korean investors. They can now purchase SAPIEN directly with their local currency, bypassing the complexity and fees of cross-exchange transfers. This seamless access is a cornerstone for fostering genuine adoption. What Challenges Could SAPIEN Face on Bithumb? However, listing is just the beginning. The real test is performance in a highly competitive environment. Bithumb’s user base is savvy and responsive, meaning SAPIEN will be under intense scrutiny from day one. The token must demonstrate clear utility and sustained trading volume to maintain visibility and avoid being lost among hundreds of other pairs. Moreover, the project team must now engage proactively with a new community. Effective communication regarding roadmap milestones and unique value propositions will be crucial to converting curious traders into long-term holders. Navigating the regulatory expectations of the South Korean market is another ongoing consideration. Actionable Insights for Crypto Enthusiasts For those watching this space, here are key points to consider: Monitor Initial Volume: The first 24-48 hours of trading will provide critical clues about initial demand and market sentiment toward SAPIEN on this new platform. Understand the Pair: Trading against KRW (SAPIEN/KRW) means price action will be influenced specifically by Korean market dynamics, which can sometimes diverge from global BTC or USD pairs. Review Project Fundamentals: Use this event as a catalyst to revisit SAPIEN’s whitepaper, use cases, and recent developments. A listing amplifies exposure, but fundamentals drive long-term value. The Bigger Picture for South Korea’s Crypto Scene Bithumb’s move to list SAPIEN is more than a single asset addition; it reflects the exchange’s strategy to diversify its offerings and capture interest in emerging Web3 and AI-adjacent tokens. It reinforces South Korea’s position as a critical hub where retail adoption can make or break a project’s early momentum. This listing could pave the way for similar tokens seeking a foothold in Asia. In conclusion, Bithumb listing SAPIEN is a transformative event that bridges a promising digital asset with a powerhouse market. It offers unparalleled opportunity for the project while presenting a new, high-potential asset for Korean traders. Success will hinge on sustained utility, community engagement, and navigating the vibrant yet demanding Korean crypto ecosystem. This is a chapter worth watching closely.

A clear Inverse Head & Shoulders formation, combined with rising accumulation and weakening trend rejection, suggests that the market may be gearing up for a powerful upside move. With momentum tightening and key levels coming into focus, ETH now stands on the verge of a breakout that could set the stage for its next major rally. Inverse Head And Shoulders Signals Brewing Momentum According to a recent update shared by crypto analyst Donald Dean, Ethereum may be gearing up for a significant move. He highlighted the development of a potential inverse head and shoulders pattern, a classic bullish reversal formation that often precedes strong upward momentum. This emerging structure suggests that ETH could soon shift into a more aggressive bullish phase if confirmed. Related Reading: Ethereum Rockets Higher, Narrowing Distance to a Make-or-Break Resistance Line Dean also pointed out that the weekly chart is showing solid support near the 50% Fibonacci retracement level, positioned around $2,750. Adding to the bullish signals, a hammer candle has appeared on the weekly timeframe, hinting at buying pressure stepping back in after recent downside movement. If the pattern plays out, Dean noted that Ethereum’s first major target lies at $4,109, a level that would allow ETH to challenge previous resistance/support zones. Reclaiming this region would mark a meaningful shift in momentum and strengthen the bullish outlook for the asset. Beyond that, the next upside target sits near $5,766, which aligns closely with the 1.618 Golden Ratio extension calculated at approximately $5,793.51. Dean described this confluence as particularly noteworthy, suggesting that if Ethereum breaks above its nearer targets, a larger rally toward this golden-ratio level becomes a realistic possibility. Growing Accumulation Suggests Bulls Are Preparing For Action In an earlier analysis, LSTRADER reminded followers of the impressive move from $1,600 to $4,800, noting that this surge had been identified in advance through both the ETH chart and the ETH/BTC setup. The analysis captured the momentum shift that preceded the rally, reinforcing the value of tracking key structural signals. Related Reading: Ethereum Open Interest Cut In Half As $6.4B In Positions Vanish: Market Reset Accelerates In the current market structure, LSTRADER noted that the chart clearly shows multiple instances where the trend faced rejection. Despite these rejections, the trend is steadily losing strength while accumulation continues to build, a combination that typically reflects growing bullish interest and the potential for an upward breakout. However, LSTRADER stressed that no major move should be assumed until the trendline itself is broken, and confirmation is still required. For now, patience is key as traders continue monitoring the structure and waiting for a decisive shift in trend direction.

55373364,639988,1764903627,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/55373364.jpeg,Ripple CEO Predicts 2026 Will Be A Breakout Year For Crypto,https://bitcoinist.com/ripple-ceo-2026-breakout-year-for-crypto/,"At Binance Blockchain Week on December 3, Ripple Labs CEO Brad Garlinghouse argued that a rare alignment of regulatory change, institutional demand and real-world utility is setting up crypto for what he called powerful “macro tailwinds” heading into 2026. “I personally will echo some of the things Richard said: there are so many macro factors that are continuing to provide tailwinds for this industry that I think as we go into 2026 I don’t remember being this optimistic in the last handful of years,” the Ripple CEO told CNBC’s Dan Murphy, speaking alongside Binance CEO Richard Teng and Solana Foundation President Lily Liu. Ripple CEO Is Optimistic For 2026: Here’s Why He framed the latest drawdown not as the start of a structural bear market but as a risk-off interlude against a fundamentally improved backdrop. “Crypto has gone through cycles and when you have risk-on people are excited now you have kind of a risk-off moment, there’s uncertainty,” he said. The difference this time, he argued, is that the United States—the largest single economy and roughly “22% of global GDP”—is finally moving away from what he described as years of open hostility toward the sector. “This is a market that has been really openly hostile to crypto for four or five years or maybe longer, and now you have that that has changed significantly, pretty quickly,” he said. Institutions, in his view, are only beginning to adjust. He pointed to the visible presence of traditional asset managers at the event: “You saw Franklin Templeton on stage here, you saw BlackRock on stage just this week. I think Vanguard has now opened up […] Vanguard historically has said ‘we won’t touch crypto’ and now they’ve had a massive sea change.” On crypto ETFs, the Ripple CEO rejected the idea that the trade was over-hyped. “Definitely no,” he said when asked whether the ETF “floor” narrative had been exaggerated. He stressed how new these vehicles still are in the United States and highlighted early demand for XRP products. “In the last two or three weeks over $700 million have flowed into XRP ETFs , which is just pent-up demand from institutional investors, from investors who want access because they don’t want to custody themselves,” he said. He argued that the key metric is crypto’s still-small slice of the overall ETF universe. “The total ETF market—only one or two percent of the total ETF market is crypto. I will bet anybody here that a year from now that will be more than one or two percent,” he said. Short-term outflows from Bitcoin products, he suggested, should be viewed in context: “Over 2026 do we really think crypto ETFs are only going to be one or two percent of the total ETF market? No chance.” Garlinghouse said Ripple’s own prime brokerage business is already seeing that shift in behavior. Institutions that had remained “on the sidelines” due to regulatory uncertainty or risk aversion are now “getting involved and they’re starting small, and they’re going to walk, then they’re going to crawl—or crawl then walk then run.” Asked directly whether recent volatility had deterred institutional capital, he replied: “Definitely not.” Stablecoins Will Be A Key Pillar Stablecoins were another pillar of his 2026 thesis. He agreed that in the latest risk-off phase, capital largely rotated into stablecoins rather than exiting on-chain rails, which he said reflects both utility and trust. “People are recognizing stablecoins can be stable and easier to manage,” he said. Garlinghouse highlighted that Ripple’s own stablecoin, launched “just over a year ago,” has “just passed about a billion market cap,” is “approved and whitelisted in Abu Dhabi ,” and is being used as “good collateral on various platforms from a lending point of view.” For him, stablecoins are an entry ramp to broader adoption, alongside other applications that will be built across Solana, Binance and Ripple ecosystems. On US policy, he said the trajectory has clearly improved, especially for payment tokens. He cited the GENIUS Act as “regulatory clarity for stablecoins” and linked it to growing corporate interest in on-chain payments. After Ripple’s acquisition of GTreasury , which has visibility into “over 10 trillion dollars of payments,” he said “the number of those customers that are already approaching us interested in leveraging stablecoins […] because of that clarity, people are leaning in.” The Ripple CEO noted that XRP has already received a form of clarity from US federal courts but said broader legislation is still needed. He referenced the “Clarity Act” for crypto, saying there is “still forward momentum” and predicting that “sometime in the first half of next year we’ll see passage of legislation, which will continue to unlock and create more tailwinds for the whole industry.” He closed with an explicit price target for the next cycle, acknowledging he was “going out on a limb”: “I’ll say Bitcoin $180,000 December 23rd—or December 31st—2026.” At press time, XRP traded at $2.15.",XRP|Brad Garlinghouse|ripple|ripple news|XRP news|XRP price,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|MARKET|XRP|BNB|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-12-05 03:00:27

The CLARITY Act is meant to clearly divide oversight between the SEC and CFTC, expanding the CFTC’s role in digital commodity markets. The SEC’s reversal of SAB 121 removes capital barriers for banks to offer crypto custody, boosting institutional participation. Blockchain security company CertiK has released a U.S. Digital Asset Policy Report examining the impact of the legislative milestones in the United States. The current federal framework emerged from the GENIUS Act, the CLARITY Act, which was passed in the U.S. House of Representatives and is still being reviewed in the Senate, and the rescission of Staff Accounting Bulletin 121. The Certik highlighted that these new federal laws and market-structure reforms have ushered in the clearest framework yet for stablecoin issuance, asset classification, and institutional custody. According to CertiK, they aim to provide “financial institutions, digital asset providers, and policymakers evaluating how federal and state rules intersect” with an authoritative resource with the report. “This report reveals a pivotal shift in how digital assets are regulated and supervised across the United States,” said Kayvon Hosseini, CertiK’s head of advisory. “By analyzing federal legislation and market structure proposals, as well as state-level obligations, the research highlights the operational demands that digital asset firms must meet in the coming years.” Federal rules set clear standards for stablecoins and custody The GENIUS Act, signed into law in July this year, establishes for the first time a federal licensing framework for payment-stablecoin issuers, sets strict reserve-asset and redemption rules, and prohibits the issuance of dollar-backed tokens without federal approval. The law was widely described as a landmark industry moment in U.S. digital-asset legislation and was welcomed by crypto companies, banks and fintechs preparing to enter the stablecoin market. The CLARITY Act, meanwhile, advances the longstanding debate over how to classify digital tokens by delineating the boundary between securities and digital commodities. The proposal, backed by Senate Republicans, would clearly define the Commodity Futures Trading Commission’s (CFTC) and the SEC’s oversight. It is said to also expand the CFTC’s oversight of digital commodity markets, reserving securities-linked products for the SEC. The report also looked into the impact of the SEC rescinding SAB 121, highlighting that the reversal “removes prior capital constraints on digital asset custodians, enabling broader bank participation.” Another finding in the report is that despite a universal baseline for cybersecurity and AML compliance existing at the federal level, fragmented state licensing regimes continue, creating “a preemption gap for multi-state operators.” Meanwhile, market-structure legislation in the Senate is paving the way for CFTC-registered exchanges to list spot crypto products, a move that could reshape trading venues for assets categorized as commodities under the CLARITY framework. CFTC Acting Chairman Caroline D. Pham earlier today announced that listed spot cryptocurrency products will begin trading for the first time in U.S. federally regulated markets on CFTC-registered futures exchanges as of December 4 Another key finding in the report is institutional pilots, such as the Regulated Liability Network and Project Guardian, which are said to demonstrate accelerating adoption of permissioned settlement infrastructure. Regulatory clarity enters the space globally Beyond the U.S., the CertiK report situates these developments within a global trend with jurisdictions around the world fast-tracking the rollout of stablecoin and digital-asset regulations. According to TRM Labs’ 2025/26 global policy review , which pointed out that “stablecoins were a huge focus for policymakers worldwide, with over 70% of jurisdictions progressing stablecoin regulation in 2025.” CertiK stated, “For financial institutions, the strategic focus is shifting toward permissioned digital assets: using blockchain-based settlement within clearly defined regulatory perimeters. As liquidity becomes segmented by jurisdiction (for example, between U.S. and EU/MiCA-compliant pools), the ability to map regulatory ‘gaps’ and build compliant, cross-jurisdictional infrastructure will be a key source of competitive advantage over the next few years.”",Industry Thoughts,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|MARKET|REGULATION|TRADING|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-12-05 03:04:43

ETH is now consolidating gains and might aim for more gains above $3,250. Ethereum started a fresh increase above the $3,050 and $3,120 levels. The price is trading above $3,120 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. There is a short-term contracting triangle forming with support at $3,130 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD (data feed via Kraken). The pair could continue to move up if it settles above the $3,240 zone. Ethereum Price Eyes Another Upside Break Ethereum price managed to stay above $2,920 and started a fresh increase, like Bitcoin . ETH price gained strength for a move above the $3,000 and $3,050 resistance levels. The bulls even pumped the price above $3,150. However, the bulls struggled to clear $3,240 and $3,250. A high was formed at $3,239 and the price recently corrected some gains. There was a spike below the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the recent move from the $2,718 swing low to the $3,239 low. Ethereum price is now trading above $3,120 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average . There is also a short-term contracting triangle forming with support at $3,130 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD. If there is another upward move, the price could face resistance near the $3,200 level. The next key resistance is near the $3,240 level. The first major resistance is near the $3,250 level. A clear move above the $3,250 resistance might send the price toward the $3,320 resistance. An upside break above the $3,320 region might call for more gains in the coming days. In the stated case, Ether could rise toward the $3,450 resistance zone or even $3,500 in the near term. Downside Correction In ETH? If Ethereum fails to clear the $3,240 resistance, it could start a fresh decline. Initial support on the downside is near the $3,120 level. The first major support sits near the $3,050 zone. A clear move below the $3,050 support might push the price toward the $3,000 support. Any more losses might send the price toward the $2,980 region and the 50% Fib retracement level of the recent move from the $2,718 swing low to the $3,239 low in the near term. The next key support sits at $2,850 and $2,840. Technical Indicators Hourly MACD – The MACD for ETH/USD is gaining momentum in the bullish zone.

55373733,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=231118,1764904212,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Crypto Liquidations: The Staggering $187M Wipeout That Crushed Long Positions,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/crypto-liquidations-long-positions-loss/,"BitcoinWorld Crypto Liquidations: The Staggering $187M Wipeout That Crushed Long Positions The cryptocurrency market just witnessed a brutal 24-hour period where over $187 million in positions were forcibly closed. This wave of crypto liquidations disproportionately hammered traders betting on higher prices, offering a stark reminder of the market’s inherent volatility. Let’s break down what happened and what it means for you. What Caused This Massive Wave of Crypto Liquidations? When traders use leverage in perpetual futures markets, they must maintain a minimum margin. If the market moves against their position and their collateral value falls below this level, exchanges automatically close, or ‘liquidate,’ their trade to prevent further loss. The recent crypto liquidations event, totaling $187 million, was triggered by a sharp price decline that breached critical support levels for many leveraged traders. A Breakdown of the $187M Liquidation Carnage The data reveals a clear and painful trend: the majority of losses came from long positions. Here is the detailed breakdown: Bitcoin (BTC): $90.06 million liquidated. A significant 67.33% of this came from long positions. Ethereum (ETH): $87.9 million liquidated, with 63.5% being longs. Solana (SOL): $9.37 million liquidated. An overwhelming 87.52% were long positions caught in the downdraft. This pattern shows that bullish sentiment was overly crowded, leaving many traders exposed when the market turned. Why Were Long Positions Hit So Hard? The dominance of long position crypto liquidations points to a classic market scenario. Before the drop, optimism likely prevailed, encouraging traders to take leveraged long bets. However, when prices fell rapidly, these highly leveraged longs became the most vulnerable. Their forced selling then added more downward pressure, creating a cascade effect that amplified the initial move. This is a key mechanism behind market volatility spikes. How Can Traders Navigate Future Liquidation Risks? While crypto liquidations are a market reality, you can manage your risk. First, always use stop-loss orders to define your exit point before you enter a trade. Second, employ sensible leverage; higher leverage magnifies both gains and losses. Third, never invest more than you can afford to lose, especially with margin trading. Finally, stay informed about market sentiment and technical levels to avoid getting caught in crowded trades. The Bigger Picture: What Do These Liquidations Signal? Large-scale crypto liquidations often act as a reset button, flushing out excessive leverage from the system. While painful for those affected, this can lead to a healthier market foundation with less speculative froth. It serves as a powerful lesson on the importance of risk management over blind speculation. The market’s recovery will depend on broader factors, but the removal of weak leveraged positions can sometimes pave the way for more sustainable moves. In summary, the recent $187 million liquidation event was a forceful demonstration of crypto market risk. Long positions bore the brunt of the damage across major assets like Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Solana. This episode underscores a non-negotiable rule for survival: robust risk management is not optional. By understanding the forces behind these crypto liquidations , you can trade with more awareness and better protect your capital from future storms. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) What are crypto liquidations? Crypto liquidations occur when an exchange forcibly closes a trader’s leveraged position because they can no longer meet the margin requirements, usually due to the market moving against them. Why were mostly long positions liquidated? This indicates that before the price drop, there was a high concentration of traders using leverage to bet on prices going up (longs). The sudden downturn hit these crowded positions hardest. Do large liquidations mean the market will crash further? Not necessarily. While liquidations can cause short-term selling pressure, they also remove weak leverage from the market, which can sometimes stabilize prices and allow for a rebound. How can I avoid getting liquidated? Use lower leverage, set strategic stop-loss orders, maintain adequate margin collateral above minimum requirements, and avoid overexposing your portfolio to a single trade. Is trading perpetual futures riskier than spot trading? Yes, significantly. Perpetual futures involve leverage, which amplifies potential gains and losses, making you susceptible to liquidation. Spot trading, where you own the asset outright, does not carry this specific risk. Where can I track liquidation data? Several analytics websites like Coinglass provide real-time data on crypto liquidations across exchanges, helping you gauge market leverage and sentiment.

Starting December 9th, you cannot deposit or withdraw POL. This Bithumb POL suspension supports a vital network upgrade. But what does this mean for your assets, and how should you prepare? Let’s break it down. Why is Bithumb Suspending POL Transactions? Bithumb is proactively supporting a scheduled upgrade to the Polygon network. The Bithumb POL suspension of deposits and withdrawals is a standard security measure. Exchanges often pause services during such events to ensure a smooth transition and protect user funds. The suspension begins precisely at 2:00 a.m. UTC on December 9th. Therefore, all POL movement on Bithumb will be frozen at that time. What Does This Mean for Your POL Tokens? First, don’t panic. Your POL tokens held on Bithumb are safe. The suspension only affects moving them on or off the exchange. You can still trade POL against other pairs on Bithumb’s spot market during this period.

In a move that impacts traders and investors, Binance, the world’s leading cryptocurrency exchange, has announced a temporary suspension of deposits and withdrawals for LUNA. This planned pause is a critical step to facilitate a seamless network upgrade. If you use Binance for your LUNA transactions, here’s everything you need to know to navigate this brief hiatus confidently. Why is Binance Suspending LUNA Services? Binance will temporarily suspend deposits and withdrawals for the LUNA token starting at 12:05 p.m. UTC on December 8. The primary reason for this Binance LUNA suspension is to provide technical support for an upcoming network upgrade on the Terra blockchain. Exchanges often implement these precautionary halts to ensure the safety of user funds during significant protocol changes. Therefore, this is a standard operational procedure, not a cause for alarm. What Does This Binance LUNA Suspension Mean for You? Understanding the scope of this suspension is crucial for planning your crypto activities. Here’s a clear breakdown of what will and won’t be affected: Deposits & Withdrawals (PAUSED): You will not be able to send LUNA to your Binance wallet or withdraw it to an external wallet during the suspension window. Trading (UNAFFECTED): Crucially, spot and futures trading for LUNA trading pairs on Binance will continue as normal. You can still buy, sell, and trade your LUNA tokens on the exchange. Existing Funds (SAFE): All LUNA tokens already held in your Binance wallet remain secure and unaffected. This targeted approach minimizes disruption, allowing market activity to continue while the technical upgrade proceeds safely in the background. How to Prepare for the Temporary Binance LUNA Halt A little preparation can prevent last-minute stress. Follow these simple steps before the suspension takes effect: Complete Pending Transactions: Finalize any urgent LUNA deposits or withdrawals well before the 12:05 p.m. UTC deadline on December 8. Monitor Official Channels: Follow Binance’s official announcements for the exact time when services will resume. Upgrades can sometimes conclude earlier or later than initially planned. Consider Trading Plans: Since trading continues, decide if you need to adjust any short-term strategies around the suspension period. What Are the Benefits of This Network Upgrade? While a temporary Binance LUNA suspension is an inconvenience, the underlying network upgrade it supports is ultimately positive. These upgrades often aim to: Enhance network security and stability. Improve transaction speed or reduce costs. Introduce new features or functionality to the Terra ecosystem. Supporting these improvements helps ensure the long-term health and scalability of the LUNA network, benefiting all token holders in the future. Conclusion: A Brief Pause for Long-Term Gain The temporary Binance LUNA suspension for deposits and withdrawals is a standard, proactive measure by a major exchange. Its purpose is to ensure a smooth and secure network transition for the Terra blockchain. By understanding what the halt entails—affecting only transfers, not trading—you can manage your assets without worry. Keep an eye on Binance’s official communication for the resumption notice, and remember that such upgrades are foundational steps toward a more robust crypto ecosystem. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) 1. Can I still trade LUNA on Binance during the suspension? Yes. The suspension applies only to deposits and withdrawals. All spot and futures trading for LUNA will continue without interruption. 2. How long will the Binance LUNA suspension last? Binance has not specified an end time. The suspension begins on December 8 at 12:05 p.m. UTC and will last until the network upgrade is complete and deemed stable. Users should monitor Binance’s official announcements for the resumption notice. 3. Are my LUNA tokens safe on Binance during this time? Absolutely. The suspension is a preventive technical measure. All LUNA funds held in your Binance wallet remain secure and unaffected. 4. What happens if I try to deposit LUNA after the suspension starts? Deposits initiated after 12:05 p.m. UTC on December 8 will not be processed and may be lost. It is critical to complete all transfers before the deadline. 5. Will other exchanges also suspend LUNA services? Possibly. Other exchanges that support the Terra network may announce similar suspensions to facilitate the same upgrade. Always check the announcements from your specific exchange. 6. What should I do if I have an urgent need to move my LUNA?

This single transaction, valued at approximately $283 million, represents one of the largest stablecoin movements recently observed on-chain. Such a colossal USDT transfer immediately raises critical questions about market sentiment, potential institutional maneuvering, and the underlying stability of the crypto ecosystem. Let’s dive into what this massive movement could mean. What Does This Massive USDT Transfer Actually Mean? When a sum this large moves off a centralized exchange like OKX, it typically signals one of a few scenarios. The recipient ‘unknown wallet’ is a private, non-custodial address, meaning the entity controlling it has taken full, direct custody of their assets. This action alone is a powerful statement. It could indicate a major investor, often called a ‘whale,’ is moving funds for safekeeping, preparing for a large over-the-counter (OTC) trade, or repositioning capital ahead of anticipated market volatility. The sheer scale of this USDT transfer suggests this is not a retail investor but a sophisticated player with significant influence. Why Are Whale Movements So Important to Watch? Tracking whale activity provides invaluable, real-time insight into the strategies of the market’s biggest participants. Their moves often precede larger price trends. For instance, moving stablecoins like USDT off an exchange can be a neutral or bearish signal, as it may mean the whale is parking value in a stable asset, waiting for a buying opportunity elsewhere in the market. Conversely, it could also be a precursor to deploying that capital into other cryptocurrencies. Therefore, this specific USDT transfer acts as a high-stakes puzzle piece for analysts trying to gauge future market direction. Key reasons analysts monitor these transfers include: Liquidity Signals: Large withdrawals can temporarily reduce exchange liquidity, potentially increasing volatility. Sentiment Indicators: Whales are often considered ‘smart money,’ and their actions can influence retail trader sentiment. Network Health: Such large transactions test the efficiency and cost-effectiveness of the underlying blockchain, in this case, likely Tron or Ethereum. Could This Impact Tether (USDT) and Market Stability? Tether’s USDT is the backbone of crypto trading pairs, providing essential liquidity. A transfer of this magnitude highlights both its critical role and the inherent transparency of blockchain technology. While the movement itself is neutral—simply a change of wallet ownership—it underscores the concentration of wealth and the potential for single entities to execute trades that could move markets. However, it also demonstrates the robust, audited reserves Tether maintains to back each token, as facilitating a $283 million USDT transfer requires immense treasury management. What Should Everyday Crypto Investors Take Away? For the average investor, this news is less about immediate action and more about education and context. You don’t need to react to every whale alert, but understanding their implications makes you a more informed participant. This event is a prime example of the unparalleled transparency in crypto; traditional finance rarely offers a public ledger showing movements of this scale in real-time. It reinforces the importance of: Using reliable blockchain explorers to verify large transactions. Recognizing that exchange flows are a key on-chain metric. Maintaining a long-term perspective and not being swayed by single data points. In conclusion, the stunning $283 million USDT transfer from OKX is a significant on-chain event that highlights the dynamic and institutional-scale activity within cryptocurrency markets. It serves as a reminder of the market’s maturity, the pivotal role of stablecoins, and the powerful analytical tools that blockchain transparency provides. While the ultimate intention behind the move remains shrouded in the ‘unknown wallet,’ its occurrence is a normal function of a thriving, liquid digital asset ecosystem. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What is an ‘unknown wallet’ in cryptocurrency? A: An ‘unknown wallet’ is a public blockchain address whose owner has not been publicly identified or linked to a known entity like an exchange, company, or individual. It signifies a private holder. Q2: Why would someone move so much USDT off an exchange? A: Primary reasons include enhanced security (self-custody), preparation for a large private trade (OTC desk), collateralization for DeFi protocols, or simply consolidating holdings in a personal vault. Q3: Does a large USDT transfer like this affect the token’s price? A: Typically, no. USDT is a stablecoin pegged to the US dollar. The transfer itself doesn’t affect its 1:1 peg, but the movement of capital can influence liquidity and sentiment on the exchanges involved. Q4: How can I track whale movements myself? A: You can use blockchain explorers like Etherscan or Tronscan, or follow social media accounts and services like Whale Alert that monitor and report large transactions automatically. Q5: Is this kind of large transfer a cause for concern? A: Not inherently. Large transfers are routine in global finance. In crypto, they are transparently recorded. It becomes a concern only if it’s part of a pattern indicating panic selling, exchange issues, or malicious activity, which is not evident here. Q6: What blockchain was this USDT transfer likely on? A: USDT exists on multiple blockchains. Given the size and source (OKX), it was most likely on the Tron network due to its low transaction fees, or possibly Ethereum. The exact chain can be verified via the transaction hash from Whale Alert. Found this deep dive into major whale movements helpful? The crypto world moves fast, and knowledge is power.

Akshat Siddhant, lead quant analyst at Mudrex, said the crypto market continues to display strong resilience. “Renewed whale accumulation is supporting the trend, as ETH whales have added over 450,000 ETH since mid-November, with BTC whales showing similar activity.” “Even with the US labour market displaying solid strength, the odds for a rate cut this month stand at 93%, contributing to the buying pressure. A clear move above $96,000 could accelerate BTC’s momentum toward $100,000, opening the path for fresh highs,” he added.

MSCI’s broad index of Asia Pacific shares outside Japan slipped roughly 0.1%, although it remained on track for a modest gain of about 0.5% for the week. Fresh data from Tokyo showed household spending in Japan fell at the fastest pace in nearly two years in October as inflation squeezed budgets. The yield on 10-year Japanese government bonds touched 1.94% early in the session, the highest since mid-2007, and was set for a rise of about 13.5 basis points for the week. Recent auctions drew solid demand, suggesting investors are taking advantage of cheaper bond prices. Chinese markets painted a mixed picture. The Shanghai Composite hovered near 3,875, down 0.02%, while the SZSE Component in Shenzhen added about 0.17%. The China A50 index slipped 0.17%, DJ Shanghai edged up 0.12% and Hong Kong’s Hang Seng lost about 0.40%. Europe Finds Support While US Traders Weigh Conflicting Data Across Europe, futures pointed to a slightly firmer tone. DAX futures traded near 23,880, up about 0.79%, FTSE 100 futures gained 0.19%, CAC 40 futures rose 0.43% and Euro Stoxx 50 futures added roughly 0.41%. US stock futures were mixed after Wall Street cash indices finished Thursday close to flat. Dow futures hovered around 47,850, down 0.07%, while S&P 500 futures inched up 0.11% and Nasdaq futures rose 0.22%. Traders continued to chew over a series of US data releases. A Labor Department report showed initial jobless claims dropped to their lowest level in more than three years, although analysts said the Thanksgiving holiday may have distorted the figures. A separate estimate from the Chicago Fed suggested the unemployment rate held near 4.4% in November. Factory Orders Lag Forecasts As Traders Brace For Key Fed Decision A delayed report from the Commerce Department showed factory orders rose 0.2%, missing expectations for a 0.5% increase, after an upward move in August was revised down to 1.3% as tariffs weighed on manufacturers. The closely watched non-farm payrolls report will not arrive on Friday, with the November figures scheduled for after the Federal Reserve’s December meeting because of an extended government shutdown. Investors have turned to secondary indicators, even as the backlog of official data clears only slowly. Fed funds futures now imply nearly a 90% chance of a 25-basis point rate cut next Wednesday, up sharply from pricing a month ago, and analysts describe the gathering as one of the most finely balanced meetings in years, with several policymakers having spoken publicly against further easing.

This colossal USDT transfer to OKX is more than just a number on a screen; it’s a significant event that can ripple through market liquidity and trader sentiment. But what does such a massive movement of the world’s leading stablecoin truly signify? Let’s dive into the implications. Why Does a Major USDT Transfer to OKX Matter? When a sum this large moves, it’s rarely an accident. A USDT transfer to OKX of this magnitude typically signals that a major market participant, often called a ‘whale,’ is preparing for significant action. This movement directly impacts market dynamics in several key ways: Increased Exchange Liquidity: The injection of $283 million in USDT dramatically boosts the buying power available on OKX, potentially facilitating larger trades with less price slippage. Bullish or Bearish Signal: Whales often move stablecoins to exchanges to either purchase other cryptocurrencies (a bullish signal) or to secure a safe haven from market volatility. Market Sentiment Gauge: The crypto community closely watches these transfers as a barometer for what sophisticated players might do next. Therefore, analyzing this transaction isn’t just about the ‘what’—it’s about the ‘why’ behind the move. Decoding the Source: What an ‘Unknown Wallet’ Tells Us The phrase ‘unknown wallet’ adds a layer of intrigue. In blockchain terms, this usually means the wallet is not publicly associated with a known exchange, foundation, or entity. This anonymity is common for private whale wallets or institutional cold storage. The sheer size suggests the owner is a sophisticated entity, possibly: A crypto investment fund rebalancing its portfolio. A large-scale trader or arbitrageur positioning for a market move. An institution preparing to execute an over-the-counter (OTC) deal facilitated by the exchange. While the exact identity is hidden, the destination—OKX—is highly revealing. Choosing a top-tier global exchange points to a desire for deep liquidity, security, and a wide range of trading pairs. Potential Impact on Crypto Prices and Liquidity So, what happens after a USDT transfer to OKX of this scale? The potential outcomes are crucial for every trader to understand. The most immediate effect is a surge of stablecoin liquidity on the exchange. This liquidity acts like fuel. If the whale uses this USDT to buy assets like Bitcoin or Ethereum, it can create significant upward price pressure. Conversely, if the transfer is preparatory—meant to be sold for fiat or simply parked—its immediate market impact may be muted. Historically, large stablecoin inflows to exchanges have sometimes preceded increased buying activity. However, it’s essential to remember correlation is not causation. This event should be one piece of a larger puzzle when making trading decisions, not the sole factor. Actionable Insights for Crypto Traders How should you, as an informed participant, process this news? First, avoid impulsive reactions. A major USDT transfer to OKX is a data point, not a direct trading signal. Use it to inform your broader market analysis. Monitor trading volumes on OKX, especially in major pairs like BTC/USDT and ETH/USDT, over the next 24-72 hours for signs of unusual activity. Furthermore, keep an eye on other blockchain analytics for context—is this an isolated event or part of a broader trend of stablecoin movement? In conclusion, the transfer of 283 million USDT is a powerful reminder of the scale at which major players operate in the crypto ecosystem. It highlights the critical role of stablecoins like USDT as the primary medium for moving value and positioning within markets. While the ultimate intention behind this specific USDT transfer to OKX remains unknown, it undeniably signifies a major shift of capital that warrants close attention from anyone serious about understanding crypto market flows. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What does a ‘whale’ mean in cryptocurrency? A: A ‘whale’ is a term for an individual or entity that holds a large enough amount of a cryptocurrency to potentially influence its market price through their trades. Q2: Why would someone transfer USDT to an exchange? A: The primary reasons are to trade it for other cryptocurrencies, to cash out into fiat currency, or to use it as collateral for lending or margin trading on the exchange platform. Q3: Is a large USDT transfer to an exchange always bullish? A: Not always. While it can indicate preparation to buy, it could also be for selling, OTC settlement, or simply moving funds between accounts. Context from subsequent trading activity is key. Q4: How can I track large crypto transactions like this one? A: You can use blockchain explorers (like Etherscan for Ethereum-based USDT) or follow social media accounts of tracking services like Whale Alert, which monitor and report large transactions. Q5: What is the difference between an ‘unknown wallet’ and an exchange wallet? A: An exchange wallet is publicly identified and associated with a specific trading platform (like OKX or Binance). An ‘unknown wallet’ is a private address not tagged to any known service, typically belonging to an individual or private institution. Q6: Could this large transfer affect the price of USDT itself? A> It’s highly unlikely. USDT is a stablecoin pegged to the US Dollar. Its value is maintained through reserves, not trading volume on exchanges. Large transfers don’t typically affect its 1:1 peg.

Though fees continue to decline broadly. From a valuation standpoint, Ethereum's 1,400x fees multiple puts ETH near its all-time high P/F valuation. MCap/TVL is a bit better at just over 5x. While still totally dominant in the ETF market, ETHA isn't a 'buy' until the SEC allows for asset staking. It has been a couple of months since I've provided a monthly recap for Ethereum ( ETH-USD ) via Seeking Alpha. Specifically for the iShares Ethereum ETF ( ETHA ), you'd have to go back all the way to March to find my most recent piece . Back then, I focused primarily on the organic bid for Ethereum as the gas token of the cryptocurrency market. I concluded that despite positive signs in usage, the lack of fees was a potential problem for price: Like many others who buy digital assets, my view has generally been that ETH is the 'digital gas' of the cryptocurrency market. With this view in mind, it's important for the fundamental thesis that the network generates fees. This keeps an organic bid on the token and also creates the burn mechanism, which reduces inflation. Thus, Ethereum's quickly eroding fee market even as secondary layers scale the network is making it increasingly difficult to justify ETH as an investment at this point in time. As fate would have it, ETHA has rallied more than 40% since that article. In this update, we'll again look at Ethereum's network usage. To be sure, there are positive signs there. We'll also look at the capital flow story since it is such an important part of what is driving demand for the token. And we'll get into valuation of the asset relative to fundamentals. Network Activity Through November 2025 In many ways, November 2025 was a continuation of a longer-term trend that we've witnessed on the Ethereum blockchain going back to the 'Dencun' upgrade. Network fees continue to go down as the average user fee paid for each transaction continues its slide down to just 51 cents per: November 2024 October 2025 November 2025 YoY MoM DAAs (000s) 400.5 490.6 483.7 20.8% -1.4% Transactions 36.7 48 45.7 24.5% -4.8% Fees $191.60 $41.40 $23.60 -87.7% -43.0% Avg Tx Fee $5.15 $0.84 $0.51 -90.1% -39.3% Source: Token Terminal, Transactions and Fees in millions Year-over-year, average transaction fees are down by 90%, which is very much in line with the decline in total network fees at 88%. The good news is daily active addresses hit 483k in the month. This was a 21% year-over-year increase, though a slight dip from October. Transactions hit 45.7 million in November; again, a noticeable 24.5% increase from November last year. DAAs and transactions each hit record highs back in August but have since pulled back slightly. Still, both metrics are above long term averages. Aiding this surge in transactions has been Ethereum's continued dominance in the stablecoin market. At the end of November, Ethereum accounted for over $171 billion of the market's $304 billion total supply. More importantly, Ethereum is seeing its share of stablecoin volume grow: Stable Tx Vol ($b) November 2024 October 2025 November 2025 YoY MoM Total Market $2,900 $7,300 $5,700 96.6% -21.9% Ethereum $858 $2,700 $2,500 191.2% -7.4% ETH Share 22.84% 27.00% 30.49% 33.5% 12.9% Source: Artemis Where companies like Circle Internet Group ( CRCL ) benefit from growth in stablecoin supply, Ethereum generated revenue from the actual usage of those coins, not from the yields from T-bill collateral. In November, Ethereum's $2.5 trillion in stable transaction volume was good for 30.5% of the total market. This was 33.5% year-over-year growth in transaction volume share. And it isn't just Ethereum that has seen this kind of growth: Stable Tx Vol by Chain (Artemis) Layer 2 networks like Base have also seen their share of stablecoin transaction volume grow year over year, from 18.7% last November to 22.5% this November. Base is actually now the second largest blockchain network by stablecoin transaction volume. DAT & ETF Flows Usage growth aside, capital flows have generally been the biggest driver of returns in the digital asset market since the approval of spot ETFs last year. Compared with other assets in the market, ETH's share of capital flows in 2025 has been stellar: Asset (mil) MTD Flows YTD Flows AUM Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) -$2,810 $26,783 $142,662 Ethereum -$1,397 $12,893 $25,512 Multi-asset $37.2 $1 $7,104 Solana ( SOL-USD ) $101.7 $3,389 $3,454 XRP ( XRP-USD ) $785.4 $2,890 $3,129 Total -$3,223 $46,105 $183,345 BTC Dominance 87.2% 58.1% 77.8% ETH Dominance 43.3% 28.0% 13.9% Source: CoinShares, Bloomberg as of 11/28/25 While Ethereum's 28% share of 2025 investment flows is far from Bitcoin's 58%, it is a large improvement over the 13.9% share of AUM. November was a difficult month for both assets, with a combined outflow of over $4 billion between the two. Lower market cap tokens did a bit better. From a DAT perspective, November was a month of holdings growth, though that growth has slowed considerably over the last several months. ETH ETF + DAT Holdings (StrategicETHReserve) At the end of November, ETH DATs held 6.4 million ETH, which was up slightly from the 6.1 million ETH at the end of October. However, this didn't quite make up for the roughly 425k ETH that came out of the ETFs. Combined DAT and ETH supply has been generally flat since mid-October. Valuation From a valuation perspective, we have a clear case of multiple expansion judging by the circulating price-to-fees ratio: Ethereum Circulating P/F Multiple (Token Terminal) At just under 1,400x fees, Ethereum is almost as expensive as it has ever been. I personally like the P/F ratio because I see it as a reasonable comp for an equity price to sales multiple. In the past, we've seen the coin grow into these types of extended multiples. The fact that usage is growing is a good sign. But still, ETH is not 'cheap' at these levels. Network DeFi TVL MCap/TVL Ethereum $71.0b 5.4 Solana $9.2b 8.7 BSC ( BNB-USD ) $7.1b 17.5 Source: DeFiLlama That said, viewing the coin through a DeFi TVL ratio tells a slightly different story. At $71 billion in TVL, Ethereum's market cap to TVL ratio is just 5.4. This is much lower than peer L1 networks and leaves the valuation interpretation up to each individual investor's preference. To be clear, I like fees better because I see Ethereum as essentially a settlement layer for digital commerce and tokenization. Thus, fees are an important input for Ethereum's fundamentals. iShares Ethereum ETF ETHA continues to be the monster in the Ethereum ETF market. ETF ETH Share (TheBlock) At 48% of the market supply, ETHA has been the clear winner in the Ethereum ETF game to this point. The fund's share of volume is even higher at roughly 70%. At just 25 basis points, ETHA is among the cheapest spot ETH ETFs in the market. However, unlike Grayscale's flagship ETH fund, ETHA has not yet been cleared by the SEC for asset staking. Until that happens, it's difficult for me to call the fund a better 'buy' than funds that do offer staking yields. Closing Summary I continue to believe ETH is an important part of the broader blockchain ecosystem, and any digital asset portfolio should include an allocation to the token and/or proxies of the token. While I'm certainly not of the view that Ethereum is cheap at 1,400x fees, history shows that ETH generally grows into its valuation through usage growth. So far, we're seeing growth in transactions and users in 2025. Yet, the fees are not quite there. The network has a sizable lead in stablecoins, which I view as another reason to be long the token in some way. While I like other opportunities better than ETHA specifically, assuming the fund is allowed to enable staking at some point in the future, it is definitely one to consider for long-term holding.",ETH-USD|ETHA,EN,0,0,ETH|MARKET|TRADING|ZRX|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Seeking Alpha', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/seekingalpha.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",seekingalpha,2025-12-05 03:57:24

Lawmakers rolled out a bipartisan bill that would force a 30-month halt on any export approvals for the company’s H200 and Blackwell chips. The whole point is to stop Beijing from getting hardware that could supercharge its own AI systems. The timing is not random. The White House, under Donald Trump, has been considering whether those chips should still be allowed to leave the country. That internal debate triggered pushback from lawmakers who think the US is giving China too much room to grow in high-end compute. The proposal is called the Secure and Feasible Exports Chips Act, and it orders the commerce secretary to deny export licenses for top-tier processors going into China for two and a half years. That would effectively shut down all H200 and Blackwell sales to the region. These chips sit at the heart of large AI models, data-center clusters, and national-scale compute power. Lawmakers argue China should not have direct access to anything this strong while the two countries compete for the lead in AI. Senators defend strict controls on advanced chip exports The bill is led by Pete Ricketts, the Republican chair of the Senate foreign relations East Asia sub-committee, and Chris Coons, the panel’s top Democrat. Pete said the US is ahead in the AI race because of its “dominance of global compute power” and argued that “denying Beijing access to these chips is therefore essential.” He added that locking in restrictions already set by President Trump while US firms continue to innovate would “allow us to widen our compute lead exponentially.” Chris said the contest will shape “the rest of the 21st century” and asked whether the future will be built on American ideas of “free thought and free markets” or those of the Chinese Communist Party. Other backers include Republicans Tom Cotton and Dave McCormick, along with Democrats Jeanne Shaheen and Andy Kim. Their push lands in the middle of deeper tension in Washington. Some China hawks believe Donald Trump is avoiding stronger security actions to protect the trade deal he negotiated with Xi Jinping last October. On Wednesday, the Financial Times reported that the US Treasury paused a plan to sanction China’s Ministry of State Security over a cyber operation called “Salt Typhoon,” which hit American telecom companies. Senior US officials also said the administration is not planning major new export controls on China for now. Industry leaders clash with Washington over chip policy Tech analyst Saif Khan from the Institute for Progress said China would gain major advantages if it secured unrestricted access to the H200. Saif said it would let Beijing build frontier-level supercomputers for cutting-edge AI, even if costs were slightly higher than running Blackwell chips. He added that it would also help Chinese cloud firms compete with large US cloud providers. Jensen Huang, Nvidia’s chief, met Donald Trump and Republican senators from the banking committee on Wednesday. Before going in, Jensen said China would not accept weaker chips and argued US companies should be able to export their best hardware instead of downgraded versions. Senator John Kennedy, a Republican on the committee, dismissed Jensen’s stance. Kennedy told reporters that Jensen was not a “credible source” on what technology the US should send to China. Kennedy said, “He’s got more money than the Father, the Son and the Holy Ghost, and he wants even more,” before adding that Jensen was not who he would trust for “objective advice.” Former White House strategist Steve Bannon, a key figure in the Maga movement, said the US should stop sending advanced chips to China altogether. Bannon pointed to the rise of Chinese AI groups like DeepSeek and said, “If this is in fact a ‘Sputnik Moment’ because of DeepSeek then we should ban all chip sales, especially high-end, but also stop all financial support — no access to debt or equity capital markets, no training, no Chinese students — just like in the cold war about nuclear weapons.” Bannon also took aim at Jensen and David Sacks, the White House AI adviser who supports a controlled export plan to make foreign firms rely on the American tech stack. Bannon said, “David Sacks has acted as the agent for the Chinese Communist party and Jensen Huang is the arms merchant.” When asked about the bill, Nvidia said the AI action plan “wisely recognizes non-military businesses everywhere should be able to choose the American technology stack, promoting US jobs and promoting national security.” Responding to Bannon, the company said, “AI is not an atomic bomb. No one should have an atomic bomb. Everyone should have AI.” The smartest crypto minds already read our newsletter. Want in?

Bitcoin Has Seen Historic Growth In Realized Cap This Cycle On-chain analytics firm Glassnode has released its Q4 2025 Digital Assets Report in collaboration with crypto investment firm Fasanara Digital, shedding light on how the market landscape has developed in the fourth quarter of 2025. One of the things the report has talked about is the trend in the Realized Cap of Bitcoin. This capitalization model calculates the total value of the cryptocurrency by assuming the the value of each individual token is equal to the price at which it was last transacted on the blockchain. The last transaction of any token is likely to represent the last time it changed hands, so the price at its time could be considered as its current cost basis. As such, the Realized Cap is a sum of the acquisition values of all coins in circulation. In other words, the model represents the total amount of capital that the investors used to purchase the asset’s supply. Considering this, changes in the indicator naturally correspond to the netflow of capital. Below is a chart that shows how the Bitcoin Realized Cap has fluctuated over the last few years. As displayed in the graph, the monthly change in the Bitcoin Realized Cap has remained positive over the last couple of years, indicating that the network has been enjoying a sustained expansion in stored capital. The rate of inflows has varied a lot over the cycle, however, accelerating to high levels during rallies and slowing down during flat or bearish periods. Most recently, the monthly increase in the metric hit a high of $39.8 billion in October, but the bearish momentum since then has meant a cooldown to $15 billion. Following the continued rise in the Realized Cap, its value has reached a new all-time high (ATH) of $1.1 trillion. The report noted that this marks “a historic milestone that underscores Bitcoin’s continued evolution as a globally held, high-liquidity asset.” The Realized Cap has clearly witnessed a significant amount of growth this cycle. But how does it stack up against the capital inflows of the past cycles? Here is another chart, this one comparing the cumulative Realized Cap change for each cycle: In total, the current cycle has attracted over $732 billion in capital. The last cycle saw $388 billion in inflows, and the two cycles before that about $90 billion combined. Thus, the latest cycle has not only outpaced each of the past cycles, but it has in fact seen a higher Realized Cap increase than all of them combined. BTC Price Bitcoin’s latest recovery has so far been holding as its price is trading around $92,800.",Bitcoin News|bitcoin|Bitcoin Cycle|bitcoin inflows|Bitcoin Realized Cap|btc|BTCUSDT,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|BUSINESS|TRADING|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-12-05 04:00:16

Related Reading: Eric Trump Says Bitcoin Could Hit $500,000, Stands By ABTC Strategy Bank Moves Could Be The Spark According to market coverage, Bitcoin tumbled about $5,000 in roughly three hours during early December, wiping more than $200 billion from the broader crypto market and triggering nearly $700 million in liquidations. That sudden drop has been linked to moves in traditional markets, not a single crypto event. Some analysts point to a change in Japan’s bond market that is pressuring the long-running yen carry trade. Reports say the Bank of Japan’s policy path is now in focus, with a key decision due in mid-December that could move global risk appetite and the yen. Whales Bought While Prices Fell On-chain trackers show large investors added to holdings during the drop. According to on-chain data aggregators, accumulator addresses picked up about 375,000 BTC over recent weeks. That figure, if measured the way those firms define “whales,” suggests big players were buying into weakness. Miners Also Cut Back Sales Based on market commentary, miner selling has slowed sharply. One widely cited dataset shows miner outflows fell from roughly 23,000 BTC per month to about 3,672 BTC in the most recent window. That drop in miner supply was flagged as a possible tailwind for price if it persists. ETF Money Flows And Model Targets Reports have also tracked ETF movements, noting several billion dollars left Bitcoin ETFs in November, and that flows remain a key short-term force for price direction. Meanwhile, major banks have published valuation work that places fair-value scenarios well above current levels — for example, JPMorgan analysts have argued a model-based target near $170,000 under certain assumptions. How Realistic Is A $180,000 Outcome? Putting these pieces together, hitting $180,000 by the end of 2026 is possible in a bullish scenario where institutional demand resumes, whale buying continues, miner selling stays low, and central-bank moves help risk appetite. But it would require sizeable, sustained inflows and a benign macro backdrop across many months — not just a one-off rally. Garlinghouse remains optimistic about his forecast. Related Reading: Bitcoin Trail Ends: $29M Seized After European Authorities Shut Down Cryptomixer Signals To Watch Next Bank of Japan guidance in mid-December could influence Bitcoin’s next move. Daily ETF flows and open interest have shown significant shifts recently. On-chain data indicates that accumulators added around 375,000 BTC while miner selling dropped sharply. These figures, if confirmed by the original data sources, may play a major role in shaping near-term price action. Garlinghouse’s $180,000 call is a high-profile, optimistic view that matches other bullish models on the market. Reports show real volatility and major flows are already shaping price. For now, the forecast is an opinion rooted in plausible scenarios — one to watch, not a certainty.

The price is now correcting gains and might struggle to stay in a positive zone. XRP price started a downside correction and tested the $2.080 zone. The price is now trading below $2.120 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. There is a bearish trend line forming with resistance at $2.110 on the hourly chart of the XRP/USD pair (data source from Kraken). The pair could start another increase if it clears $2.150. XRP Price Dips Again XRP price started a downside correction from the $2.220 zone, like Bitcoin and Ethereum . The price dipped below the $2.20 and $2.150 levels to enter a consolidation phase. The price even dipped below the 50% Fib retracement level of the upward move from the $1.984 swing low to the $2.220 high. Besides, there is a bearish trend line forming with resistance at $2.110 on the hourly chart of the XRP/USD pair. However, the bulls remained active above the $2.080 support. The price is now trading below $2.10 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. If there is a fresh upward move, the price might face resistance near the $2.110 level and the trend line. The first major resistance is near the $2.150 level, above which the price could rise and test $2.220. A clear move above the $2.220 resistance might send the price toward the $2.2850 resistance. Any more gains might send the price toward the $2.350 resistance. The next major hurdle for the bulls might be near $2.420. Another Decline? If XRP fails to clear the $2.150 resistance zone, it could start a fresh decline. Initial support on the downside is near the $2.080 level and the 61.8% Fib retracement level of the upward move from the $1.984 swing low to the $2.220 high. The next major support is near the $2.040 level. If there is a downside break and a close below the $2.040 level, the price might continue to decline toward $2.00. The next major support sits near the $1.9850 zone, below which the price could continue lower toward $1.920. Technical Indicators Hourly MACD – The MACD for XRP/USD is now gaining pace in the bearish zone. Hourly RSI (Relative Strength Index) – The RSI for XRP/USD is now below the 50 level. Major Support Levels – $2.080 and $2.040. Major Resistance Levels – $2.110 and $2.150.",XRP|Ripple|XRPBTC|XRPUSD|xrpusdt,EN,0,0,BTC|MARKET|TRADING|XRP|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'NewsBTC', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/newsbtc.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",newsbtc,2025-12-05 04:18:37
