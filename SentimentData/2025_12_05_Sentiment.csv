In its report titled “Understanding Stablecoins,” the IMF reviewed how major economies, including the United States, the United Kingdom, the European Union, and Japan, regulate stablecoins and found that national approaches remain widely inconsistent. Stablecoins have the potential to reshape cross-border payments and capital flows. They offer opportunities, but also bring new risks—financial integrity, regulatory oversight, consumer protection, capital flow management, monetary sovereignty, and more.

Stablecoins Are Moving Faster Than Regulators Can Track, IMF Warns The IMF said this regulatory patchwork allows stablecoins to move across borders faster than oversight can follow. Issuers can operate from lightly regulated jurisdictions while serving users in stricter markets, limiting authorities’ ability to monitor reserves, redemptions, liquidity management, and anti-money laundering controls. The fund warned that this creates regulatory arbitrage and weakens global supervision. The report also pointed to technical fragmentation. Stablecoins increasingly operate across different blockchains and exchanges that are not always interoperable. According to the IMF, this lack of coordination raises transaction costs, slows market development, and creates barriers to efficient global payments. Differences in national regulatory treatment further complicate cross-border usage and settlement. Source: IMF Stablecoins remain dominated by U.S. dollar-denominated tokens. The IMF said the global stablecoin market is now worth more than $300 billion. Tether’s USDT and Circle’s USDC make up the majority of that supply. About 40% of USDC’s reserves are held in short-term U.S. treasuries, while roughly 75% of USDT’s reserves are in short-term treasuries, with another 5% held in Bitcoin. The concentration of reserves in government debt markets links stablecoins directly to traditional financial systems Widespread use of foreign-currency stablecoins can weaken domestic monetary control, lower demand for local currency, and accelerate digital dollarization. Stablecoins also make it easier to bypass capital controls through unhosted wallets and offshore platforms. In addition to monetary concerns, the fund cited broader financial stability concerns. Large-scale redemptions could force rapid sales of Treasury bills and repo assets, potentially disrupting short-term funding markets that are critical for monetary policy transmission. The IMF also noted that the increasing interconnection between stablecoin issuers, banks, custodians, crypto exchanges, and funds also increases the risk of contagion spreading from digital markets into the wider financial system. IMF Urges Unified Stablecoin Regulation as Cross-Border Risks Grow To address these risks, the IMF released new global policy guidelines intended to reduce fragmentation. It called for harmonized definitions of stablecoins, consistent rules for reserve assets, and shared cross-border monitoring frameworks. The fund said issuers should be subject to the principle of “same activity, same risk, same regulation,” regardless of whether the issuer is a bank, fintech company, or crypto platform. The IMF also said stablecoins should be backed only by high-quality liquid assets such as short-term government securities, with strict limits on risky holdings. Issuers must guarantee full one-to-one redemption at par, on demand, at all times. Strong international coordination on anti-money laundering enforcement, licensing, and supervision of large global stablecoin arrangements was also included in the new guidance. The IMF’s warning comes as regulatory pressure is rising worldwide. In Europe, the European Central Bank recently warned that stablecoins, despite their small footprint in the euro area, now pose spillover risks due to their growing ties to U.S. Treasury markets. The ECB warns that stablecoins are growing fast, now topping $280B, with rising spillover risks as USDT and USDC dominate 90% of the market. #Stablecoins #ECB https://t.co/ef16HZzqYL — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) November 24, 2025 The European Systemic Risk Board has also called for urgent safeguards against cross-border stablecoin structures operating under the EU’s MiCA framework. In China, the central bank has described stablecoins as a threat to financial stability and monetary sovereignty, while the Bank of England and Basel regulators are reassessing how banks should hold capital against stablecoin exposure as usage expands. The IMF concluded that without consistent global regulation, stablecoins could bypass national safeguards, destabilize vulnerable economies, and transmit financial shocks across borders at high speed.

The Nasdaq-listed Digital Asset Treasury firm for the TON token has filed to raise a staggering $420.7 million. This AlphaTON securities filing represents more than just capital—it’s a strategic bet on the convergence of artificial intelligence and blockchain technology. Let’s explore what this means for investors, the TON ecosystem, and the broader crypto landscape. What Does the AlphaTON Securities Filing Actually Mean? AlphaTON recently submitted a Form S-3 shelf registration with U.S. financial authorities. This regulatory filing allows the company to issue up to $420.69 million in securities over time. Think of it as getting pre-approval for fundraising—the company can now tap into capital markets when conditions are favorable without starting from scratch each time. The timing is particularly interesting. As traditional finance shows increasing interest in digital assets, AlphaTON’s move positions it at the intersection of regulated securities and innovative blockchain technology. The company plans to use these funds for several strategic initiatives that could reshape its role in the crypto ecosystem. Where Will the $420.7 Million Actually Go? AlphaTON has outlined clear priorities for the substantial capital it seeks to raise. The allocation strategy reveals much about where the company sees the greatest opportunities for growth and innovation. The primary focus will be expanding AI and high-performance computing infrastructure. Specifically, this expansion will support Telegram’s Cocoon AI network—an ambitious project that could revolutionize how users interact with artificial intelligence through the popular messaging platform. Beyond AI infrastructure, the funds will support: TON token acquisition and related digital assets Strategic investments in TON ecosystem startups General corporate purposes and operational expansion This diversified approach shows AlphaTON isn’t putting all its eggs in one basket. Instead, the company is building a comprehensive strategy that strengthens multiple aspects of its business simultaneously. Why This AlphaTON Securities Move Matters for Crypto Investors The significance of this AlphaTON securities filing extends far beyond the company itself. It represents several important trends in the evolving relationship between traditional finance and cryptocurrency. First, it demonstrates that established companies can successfully navigate regulatory requirements while operating in the digital asset space. AlphaTON’s Nasdaq listing already provided legitimacy, but this securities filing shows the company can work within traditional financial frameworks while focusing on innovative technologies. Second, the specific focus on AI infrastructure highlights how blockchain companies are expanding beyond their original mandates. AlphaTON started as a Digital Asset Treasury firm but now positions itself at the intersection of multiple cutting-edge technologies. Finally, the substantial investment planned for the TON ecosystem signals strong confidence in Telegram’s blockchain ambitions. As one of the most widely used messaging platforms globally, Telegram’s integration with blockchain through TON creates unique opportunities for mass adoption. What Challenges Could AlphaTON Face? While the AlphaTON securities filing represents an ambitious vision, the company will need to navigate several potential challenges. Regulatory scrutiny will likely intensify as the company raises and deploys such substantial capital. U.S. financial authorities pay close attention to crypto-related securities offerings, particularly when they involve substantial sums. Market conditions present another consideration. The success of any securities offering depends on investor appetite, which can fluctuate with broader economic trends and crypto market sentiment. AlphaTON’s shelf registration provides flexibility, but ultimately the company must issue securities when market conditions are favorable. Execution risk represents the final major challenge. Successfully deploying $420.7 million across AI infrastructure, token acquisitions, and startup investments requires sophisticated management and strategic discipline. The company must demonstrate it can allocate capital effectively across these diverse areas. The Bigger Picture: AI Meets Blockchain AlphaTON’s focus on funding Telegram’s Cocoon AI network deserves special attention. This represents one of the most concrete examples of blockchain and artificial intelligence convergence in the current market. The integration could work in both directions: blockchain technology might provide the transparency and security framework for AI systems, while AI could enhance blockchain applications through improved analytics and user experiences. AlphaTON’s substantial investment suggests the company sees this intersection as particularly promising. For the TON token specifically, this development could drive increased utility and demand. If Cocoon AI becomes widely adopted within Telegram’s massive user base, the underlying blockchain infrastructure—and its native token—could see corresponding growth. Conclusion: A Strategic Bet on Convergence AlphaTON’s $420.7 million securities filing represents more than just a fundraising effort. It’s a strategic declaration that positions the company at the convergence of artificial intelligence, blockchain technology, and traditional finance. The move demonstrates growing institutional confidence in structured approaches to digital asset investment while highlighting the expanding possibilities of the TON ecosystem. As AlphaTON deploys this capital toward AI infrastructure, token acquisition, and ecosystem investments, the crypto community will watch closely. The success or challenges the company faces could provide valuable insights into how traditional financial instruments can support innovative blockchain applications. One thing is clear: AlphaTON isn’t thinking small, and its ambitions could help shape how AI and blockchain technologies evolve together. Frequently Asked Questions What is a Form S-3 shelf registration? A Form S-3 is a regulatory filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission that allows companies to register securities for future offering. The “shelf” aspect means the company can issue these securities over time when market conditions are favorable, rather than all at once. How will AlphaTON use the $420.7 million? The company plans to allocate funds across three main areas: expanding AI and high-performance computing infrastructure for Telegram’s Cocoon AI network, purchasing TON tokens and related digital assets, and investing in startups within the TON ecosystem. What is AlphaTON’s relationship with Telegram? AlphaTON is a Digital Asset Treasury firm specifically for the TON token, which is integrated with Telegram’s messaging platform. While separate entities, their strategies are closely aligned, particularly regarding blockchain and AI development. How might this securities filing affect TON token value? While direct impacts are uncertain, substantial investment in the TON ecosystem could increase utility and demand for the token. However, cryptocurrency values depend on numerous factors beyond single corporate actions. Is this a common practice for crypto companies? Traditional securities filings by Nasdaq-listed crypto companies are becoming more common as the industry matures. However, the scale of AlphaTON’s filing and its specific focus on AI infrastructure represents a notable development. What risks should investors consider? Potential risks include regulatory challenges, market condition fluctuations affecting securities issuance, and execution risks in deploying substantial capital across diverse initiatives.

55368474,639912,1764889217,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/55368474.jpeg,"Ethereum Whale Redistribution Continues: Moves 5,000 ETH As Price Reclaims $3K Level",https://bitcoinist.com/ethereum-whale-redistribution-continues-moves-5000/,"Ethereum is showing notable relative strength as it reclaims the $3,150 level and attempts to push higher, signaling early signs of recovery after weeks dominated by heavy selling pressure, fear, and uncertainty. The broader market rebound has helped restore confidence, but ETH’s ability to outperform key altcoins highlights growing demand and improved sentiment around the asset. Adding to the renewed optimism, fresh on-chain data from Lookonchain reveals a significant move from one of the market’s most recognized whales. During the rebound, whale 0xdECF deposited another 5,000 ETH—worth approximately $15.52 million—into Binance. This wallet has become well-known for sending large batches of ETH to exchanges throughout the recent downturn, often coinciding with moments of heightened volatility and capitulation. Its latest deposit suggests that the whale remains highly active and responsive to market conditions. While such movements can sometimes introduce uncertainty, they also highlight increasing liquidity and engagement from major holders. With price reclaiming key levels and whales repositioning, Ethereum enters a critical phase where sustained strength could confirm a broader shift in market structure. Ethereum Whale Distribution Highlights Market Caution According to Lookonchain, whale 0xdECF has sold 25,603 ETH—valued at approximately $85.44 million—across Binance and Galaxy Digital since October 28. Despite this substantial distribution , the wallet still holds 5,000 ETH (around $15.52 million), suggesting that the whale has not fully exited its position but has significantly reduced exposure during the recent market decline. This pattern of behavior provides important insight into sentiment among large holders: while they are not abandoning Ethereum entirely, they are actively managing risk and responding to volatility more aggressively than usual. Such persistent selling pressure from a large wallet often acts as a drag on price during periods of weakness, especially when market liquidity is thin. However, the fact that the whale continues to retain a meaningful position indicates an expectation of potential recovery—or at least a desire to remain strategically exposed to future upside. Ethereum now finds itself in a critical phase. The asset has reclaimed key levels, but its mid-term structure remains highly sensitive to macro conditions and whale behavior. If selling from major holders slows and accumulation begins to outpace distribution, the recent rebound could solidify into a sustained trend. Otherwise, renewed sell flows could place Ethereum at risk of revisiting lower support zones. ETH Reclaims Short-Term Momentum but Faces Heavy Resistance Ethereum’s daily chart shows a clear improvement in momentum after reclaiming the $3,150–$3,200 region, but the broader structure remains fragile. The bounce from the $2,750–$2,850 support zone marked a decisive shift in buyer behavior, with strong lower wicks indicating aggressive demand. This rebound has pushed ETH back above key short-term levels, yet the asset still faces a challenging path forward. Price is now approaching the 50-day SMA, currently sloping downward just above $3,250, which now acts as immediate resistance. This moving average has capped every rally since late October and remains the first major barrier for bulls to reclaim. Beyond it, the 100-day SMA around $3,450 and the 200-day SMA near $3,600 form a tight cluster of overhead resistance that defines the medium-term downtrend. Volume on the recent bounce is stronger than previous attempts, signaling that buyers are showing more conviction compared to the mid-November attempts to recover. However, the overall trend still leans bearish until ETH can break above the 50-day SMA and begin closing daily candles over $3,300. Ethereum sits in a critical inflection zone: holding above $3,100 strengthens the case for continued recovery, while rejection from the $3,250–$3,300 band could trigger another retest of the $2,800 region. The next few sessions will determine whether this rebound evolves into a deeper trend reversal.

As the broader crypto landscape begins to stabilize, ETH stands out as one of the assets showing early signs of recovery, drawing renewed attention from traders and long-term investors alike. Related Reading: Tron Hits $80.2B Stablecoin Milestone After Tether Mints 1B USDT On The Network A key factor supporting this shift is the Net Unrealized Profit/Loss (NUPL) reading for Ethereum on Binance, which is currently sitting around 0.22 while price trades near $3,100. This level reflects a delicate equilibrium between fear and optimism, indicating that a significant portion of ETH holders remain in moderate profit. Importantly, NUPL has not yet moved into the “greed” zone typically seen in the late stages of a bullish cycle, suggesting that the market is far from overheated. Instead, Ethereum appears to be transitioning into a more neutral, constructive phase where investors are cautiously optimistic but not excessively euphoric. This balance often forms the foundation for a healthier recovery, especially after a deep correction. If momentum continues building and NUPL remains stable or trends higher, ETH could be positioning itself for a stronger upside move in the coming weeks. NUPL Signals a Transitional Market Phase Arab Chain notes that Ethereum’s NUPL index experienced a significant rise between June and August, reaching levels far higher than today and reflecting strong profitability across the network during mid-2025. At that time, investor sentiment leaned toward optimism, supported by rising prices and improving macro conditions. However, as Ethereum’s price began to decline steadily from October onward, unrealized profits started to shrink. This pushed NUPL down toward more neutral territory, signaling a shift in sentiment from elevated optimism to a more grounded, cautious outlook. Crucially, NUPL has not fallen into negative territory, meaning the average ETH holder has not transitioned into unrealized losses. This is an important sign of underlying market strength. When investors remain in profit, they tend to be less motivated to sell aggressively at lower prices, reducing the risk of panic-driven capitulation and helping stabilize price action during corrections. Taken together, these signals indicate that Ethereum is currently in a transitional phase. The market is neither euphoric nor fearful—rather, it is waiting for a decisive catalyst to define the next trend. As long as NUPL stays above 0.20, Ethereum retains a meaningful level of investor confidence, increasing the likelihood of a rebound if liquidity strengthens or positive fundamental developments emerge.

The long lower wick from last week’s candle confirms strong buy-side interest around the $2,700–$2,800 zone, an area that has historically acted as a major demand region during multi-month corrections. ETH has now reclaimed the 100-week SMA, a key trend indicator currently positioned near $2,900, signaling renewed structural stability. The 200-week SMA, sitting comfortably lower, continues to reinforce the long-term uptrend. However, the 50-week SMA, which has flattened and now looms around the $3,350–$3,400 level, represents the next significant resistance level. ETH will need a decisive weekly close above this moving average to confirm a true shift back into bullish momentum.

Micro1, a three-year-old startup, has just revealed a staggering financial milestone that underscores this reality: crossing $100 million in annual recurring revenue (ARR). This explosive growth from just $7 million at the start of the year positions Micro1 as a formidable competitor to established players like Scale AI and highlights the immense, often overlooked, market for human-curated AI training data. For cryptocurrency and tech investors, this signals where substantial capital is flowing as AI development intensifies. How Micro1 Achieved Explosive ARR Growth in AI Data Training Micro1’s financial trajectory is nothing short of remarkable. Founded by 24-year-old CEO Ali Ansari while at UC Berkeley, the company began 2025 with approximately $7 million in ARR. According to Ansari’s exclusive statement to Bitcoin World, that figure has now soared past $100 million. This represents growth of more than 1,300% in under a year and more than doubles the revenue Micro1 reported in September 2024 when it announced its $35 million Series A funding round at a $500 million valuation. The company’s core business involves recruiting and managing human domain experts who create and evaluate the training data essential for developing advanced AI systems. This includes work with leading AI labs like Microsoft and other Fortune 100 companies focused on improving large language models through techniques like reinforcement learning and post-training. Micro1’s growth acceleration coincided with significant industry shifts, particularly after OpenAI and Google DeepMind reportedly severed ties with Scale AI following Meta’s massive $14 billion investment in that vendor. This created immediate opportunities for competitors to capture market share in the suddenly more competitive landscape. Micro1 Versus Scale AI and Other Competitors in the Data Training Arena While Micro1’s $100M ARR represents impressive growth, the company still trails larger competitors in absolute revenue terms. According to industry sources speaking to Bitcoin World, Mercor reportedly exceeds $450 million in ARR, while Surge is said to have reached approximately $1.2 billion in 2024 revenue. However, Micro1’s differentiation lies in its specialized approach to recruiting and evaluating domain experts. The company began as an AI recruiter called Zara, matching engineering talent with software roles before pivoting to the data-training market. This background informs their proprietary tool that interviews and vets applicants seeking expert roles on their platform. Company Reported ARR/Revenue Primary Focus Key Differentiator Micro1 $100M+ ARR Domain expert recruitment & management Proprietary vetting system, early robotics data focus Mercor $450M+ ARR AI training data solutions Scale, established enterprise relationships Surge $1.2B (2024) Comprehensive AI data services Full-service platform, global operations Scale AI Private (historically dominant) Data annotation & validation Pioneer in the space, Meta partnership Ansari attributes Micro1’s competitive edge to their ability to quickly identify and onboard true domain specialists across hundreds of fields, from highly technical disciplines to surprisingly offline domains. The platform currently manages thousands of experts, many earning close to $100 per hour, including Harvard professors and Stanford PhDs who dedicate significant time to training AI through Micro1. The Critical Role of Human Experts in Advancing AI Systems Micro1’s business model rests on a fundamental truth about contemporary AI development: despite advances in synthetic data generation and automated training techniques, human expertise remains irreplaceable for creating high-quality training data and evaluating model performance. This is particularly true for: Reinforcement Learning: Human feedback is essential for creating reward models that guide AI behavior Model Evaluation: Experts assess output quality, identify biases, and grade performance Specialized Knowledge: Domain-specific expertise ensures accuracy in technical, medical, legal, and other specialized fields Edge Cases: Humans identify and address scenarios that automated systems might miss “There are Harvard professors and Stanford PhDs spending half their week training AI through Micro1,” Ansari revealed. “But the bigger shift is in the sheer volume and range of roles. It’s expanding into areas you wouldn’t expect to matter for language model training, including offline and less technical fields.” The $100 Billion Market Opportunity in AI Data Training Ansari projects that the market for human-generated AI training data will expand dramatically from its current estimated $10-15 billion to nearly $100 billion within two years. This growth will be driven by two emerging segments that are currently barely visible but poised for explosive expansion: Enterprise AI Agent Development: Non-AI-native Fortune 1000 companies will begin building AI agents for internal workflows, support operations, finance, and industry-specific tasks. Developing these agents requires systematic human evaluation at every stage: testing frontier models, grading output, selecting winners, fine-tuning, and continuous validation. Robotics Pre-training: The next frontier in AI requires high-quality, human-generated demonstrations of everyday physical tasks. Micro1 is already building what Ansari calls “the world’s largest robotics pre-training dataset,” collecting demonstrations from hundreds of generalists recording object interactions in their homes. “We anticipate that a good portion of the product budgets at non AI-native enterprises will go towards evals and human data, moving from 0% to at least 25% of product budgets,” Ansari explained. “We’re also helping robotics labs create robotics data; these two areas will account for a massive share of that $100 billion a year market.” What Micro1’s Growth Means for the Future of AI Development Micro1’s rapid ascent signals several important trends in the AI industry: Human-in-the-loop systems are becoming more valuable, not less: As AI capabilities advance, the need for sophisticated human evaluation and specialized training data increases correspondingly The market is fragmenting: No single player will dominate the entire AI data training ecosystem, creating opportunities for specialized competitors Quality matters more than quantity: The shift toward domain expertise over general annotation suggests a maturation in how the industry approaches training data New applications drive new data needs: Robotics and enterprise AI agents represent entirely new categories of demand For now, Ansari says Micro1 is focused on scaling responsibly, paying experts well, and “keeping people at the center of an industry built on training machines.” The company’s early moves into robotics data and enterprise agent development, combined with scaling its specialized reinforcement learning environments, position it to capture additional market share as competition intensifies. Frequently Asked Questions What is Micro1 and what does it do? Micro1 is a startup that helps AI labs and enterprises recruit and manage human domain experts for creating and evaluating AI training data. The company connects specialists across hundreds of fields with organizations developing advanced AI systems. Who founded Micro1? Micro1 was founded by Ali Ansari while he was a student at UC Berkeley. Ansari, now 24, serves as the company’s CEO. How does Micro1 compare to Scale AI? Both companies operate in the AI data training space, but Micro1 positions itself as more focused on recruiting and managing true domain experts rather than general data annotation. Scale AI, which received a $14 billion investment from Meta , has historically dominated the market but faces increased competition following reported departures of major clients like OpenAI and Google DeepMind. What companies use Micro1’s services? Micro1 works with leading AI labs including Microsoft as well as Fortune 100 companies. While specific client names beyond Microsoft aren’t disclosed, the company serves organizations racing to improve large language models through techniques like reinforcement learning. What is the market size for AI data training? According to Micro1’s estimates, the current market for human-generated AI training data is approximately $10-15 billion, but is projected to grow to nearly $100 billion within two years as new applications like enterprise AI agents and robotics create additional demand. Conclusion Micro1’s journey from $7M to $100M+ in ARR in under a year reveals more than just another startup success story. It exposes the critical, often invisible, human infrastructure powering the AI revolution. As artificial intelligence systems grow more sophisticated, their dependence on high-quality human expertise paradoxically increases. The companies that can best identify, organize, and deploy this expertise stand to capture extraordinary value in what is rapidly becoming a hundred-billion-dollar market. For investors and industry observers, Micro1’s explosive growth serves as a powerful indicator of where the real bottlenecks—and opportunities—reside in the race toward artificial general intelligence.

Internet Computer protocol price forecast for 2028 expects the token to reach a peak price of $14.03. By 2031, the price of Internet Computer might reach a maximum of $22.81. Internet Computer (ICP) is a groundbreaking blockchain network developed by the DFINITY Foundation. It aims to extend the functionality of the internet, enabling it to host backend software and transforming it into a global, decentralized computer. Internet computer blockchain incorporates advanced cryptography and innovative technology to provide scalable, efficient, and secure decentralized applications (dApps). Given its robust technology and expanding utility, the Internet Computer blockchain’s future price prospects look promising. As more developers build on the platform and adoption increases, ICP token demand will likely rise. Does Internet Computer coin have a future? How much will Internet Computer coin cost in 2025? Will ICP reach $1000? Let’s get into the current price analysis and predictions. Overview Cryptocurrency Internet Computer Token ICP Price $3.69 Market Cap $1.99B Trading Volume $99.89M Circulating Supply 541.49M ICP All-time High $750.73 (May 10, 2021) All-time Low $2.86 (Sep 2023) 24-h High $3.86 24-h Low $3.62 Internet Computer Network technical analysis Metric Value Volatility (30-day period) 25.54% (Extremely High) 14-Day RSI 40.56 (Neutral) 50-Day SMA $4.44 Sentiment Bearish Fear & Greed Index 26 (Fear) Green Days 11/30 (37 %) 200-Day SMA $5.11 Internet Computer price analysis TL;DR Breakdown ICP is holding a thin support near $3.69 while bearish momentum slowly cools. The 4-hour chart shows early signs of stabilization but no confirmed breakout. Oversold money flow suggests a potential relief bounce, but resistance at $3.74–$3.78 remains a significant barrier. ICP 1-day price analysis As seen on the 1-day chart for December 4, ICP continues to hover around $3.69, pressing against the lower half of its Bollinger Bands, showing a market that has lost directional conviction but hasn’t fully broken down. The price remains below the mid-band at $4.31, keeping bears marginally in control. However, the bands are tightening, suggesting a potential volatility squeeze is forming. If bulls fail to defend the $3.60–$3.55 region, the lower band near $3.24 becomes the next vulnerability. However, the current slow drift lower suggests exhaustion rather than aggressive selling. ICPUSDT 1-day price chart by TradingView The momentum remains weak with the MACD deeply negative and its histogram still printing soft red bars, reflecting lingering bearish pressure even as the rate of decline slows. Meanwhile, the MFI sits at 29, approaching oversold territory, which often precedes short-term relief bounces. This combination of compressed volatility, fading bearish momentum, and near-oversold money flow implies ICP is closer to stabilizing than breaking down, but hasn’t yet found the strength for a reversal. ICP 4-hour price analysis On the 4-hour chart, ICP trades slightly above $3.69 with price attempting to steady after a sequence of uneven candles. The Alligator lines are starting to compress, suggesting directionless movement and a market waiting for a catalyst. The jaw at $3.78 still leans downward, maintaining overhead pressure, while the lips and teeth around $3.73–$3.74 indicate that buyers are attempting to regain micro-control but haven’t yet overcome resistance. ICPUSDT 4-hour price chart by TradingView The MACD has crossed slightly bullish, printing faint green bars and showing the first signs of upward momentum. However, the weak slope and proximity to the zero line show that buyers lack follow-through. If price can reclaim $3.74–$3.78, a short burst toward $3.82 becomes feasible, but failure to hold $3.66–$3.65 may re-expose the lower range and put $3.60 back into play. ICP technical indicators: Levels and action Daily simple moving average (SMA) Period Value Action SMA 3 $4.13 SELL SMA 5 $4.06 SELL SMA 10 $4.15 SELL SMA 21 $4.55 SELL SMA 50 $4.44 SELL SMA 100 $4.48 SELL SMA 200 $5.11 SELL Daily exponential moving average (EMA) Period Value Action EMA 3 $4.46 SELL EMA 5 $4.50 SELL EMA 10 $4.55 SELL EMA 21 $4.73 SELL EMA 50 $4.99 SELL EMA 100 $5.20 SELL EMA 200 $5.77 SELL What to expect from ICP price analysis ICP is likely to stay range-bound with a mild upward bias if $3.65 holds, but only a close above $3.78 would signal a meaningful recovery attempt. Failure to maintain current support risks a retest of $3.55–$3.24. Is Internet Computer a good investment? The Internet Computer (ICP) has shown significant potential and volatility since its launch, which is common for relatively new and ambitious blockchain projects. Its technology aims to decentralize the internet and bring smart contract functionality to the web, which could have wide-ranging implications for the future of web speed.

A new report from banking giant JP Morgan delivers a crucial insight for investors watching the volatile saga of companies like Strategy that hold Bitcoin on their balance sheets. The analysts argue that the risk of an MSCI exclusion has been largely priced in, potentially capping further dramatic losses. This perspective offers a lifeline of clarity in a confusing period for crypto-correlated stocks. What Did JP Morgan Actually Say About the MSCI Exclusion Risk? JP Morgan’s research team provided a detailed assessment of the situation facing Strategy. The core of their argument is straightforward: the market is efficient. The massive 40% drop in Strategy’s stock price between October and early December acts as concrete evidence that investors have already priced in a high probability of removal from the MSCI indices. Therefore, the actual event of an MSCI exclusion , while negative, may not trigger another collapse. The report describes the current share price as reflecting the potential for exclusion from all major indices, not just MSCI. This analysis shifts the investor focus from fear of an unknown event to evaluation of an already discounted one. How Does This Situation Connect Strategy and Bitcoin? The fate of Strategy and the price of Bitcoin are now intertwined in the eyes of institutional analysts. JP Morgan identifies MSCI’s final decision as the most critical variable for both. Here’s why the connection matters: Institutional Sentiment: An MSCI exclusion would signal a regulatory or reputational caution from a major index provider, affecting all companies with digital asset treasuries (DATs). Market Liquidity: Index funds that track MSCI would be forced to sell Strategy’s stock, creating automatic selling pressure. Bitcoin Correlation: Negative news for a major Bitcoin-holding company often spills over into broader crypto market sentiment, impacting BTC’s price. JP Morgan’s view suggests this feedback loop is already accounted for in current valuations. What Are the Potential Scenarios for Strategy’s Stock Now? The path forward hinges on MSCI’s verdict. JP Morgan outlines two clear scenarios based on the outcome, providing a framework for investor expectations. The Downside Scenario (Exclusion Happens): Even if MSCI decides to exclude Strategy, JP Morgan projects that the downside pressure would be limited. The brutal sell-off has likely done the heavy lifting. While the stock may dip further on the news, the floor may be closer than many fear. The Upside Scenario (Inclusion Maintained): This is where it gets interesting. If MSCI decides against exclusion, JP Morgan sees potential for a powerful rebound. The stock could rally back toward the price levels seen before the major sell-off on October 10th. This would represent a significant recovery, rewarding investors who held through the uncertainty. Why Should Crypto Investors Pay Attention to This Analysis? This isn’t just about one stock. The JP Morgan report is a masterclass in how traditional finance interprets crypto-market events. It demonstrates that: Major banks are closely modeling crypto-linked equity risks. Market efficiency principles apply to volatile crypto assets. Institutional frameworks are being used to gauge downside limits and upside potential. For anyone invested in Bitcoin or crypto-related stocks, understanding this institutional perspective is invaluable. It moves the narrative from panic to calculated risk assessment. Conclusion: Navigating Uncertainty with Clarity JP Morgan’s analysis cuts through the noise surrounding the potential MSCI exclusion . By framing the dramatic price drop as the market pricing in the risk, they provide a logical anchor in a turbulent sea. The key takeaway is that the largest wave of selling may have already passed. Whether the final decision brings relief or confirmation, the immediate financial shock appears contained. This offers a more measured landscape for investors to navigate, emphasizing research over reaction. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) What is an MSCI exclusion? An MSCI exclusion occurs when a company is removed from a major global stock index managed by MSCI Inc. This can force index-tracking funds to sell the stock, often leading to significant selling pressure. Why is MSCI reviewing companies like Strategy? MSCI is reviewing companies that hold digital assets like Bitcoin on their balance sheets (Digital Asset Treasuries or DATs) due to potential regulatory, custody, and valuation concerns associated with cryptocurrencies. What does ‘priced in’ mean? ‘Priced in’ means that the market has already anticipated a future event and adjusted asset prices accordingly. In this case, the large drop in Strategy’s stock price suggests investors have already accounted for a high chance of exclusion. How does this affect Bitcoin’s price? Negative news for a major corporate Bitcoin holder can hurt overall market sentiment and increase perceived risk, potentially putting downward pressure on Bitcoin’s price. Conversely, a positive resolution could boost confidence. What other companies could be affected by such reviews? Any publicly traded company that holds significant cryptocurrencies as treasury assets could face similar scrutiny from index providers and institutional investors in the future.

Among today’s big gainers are Zcash (+9.5%), Bittensor (+7.5%), Avalanche (+4.5%), Ethereum (+3.5%), and Cardano (+2.5%), while Bitcoin has more or less remained stuck at $92,950. Investors have regained optimism in recent days amid a growing expectation that the Federal Reserve will soon provide another cut to interest rates , something which, in combination with the arrival of more altcoin ETFs, could send prices higher across the board. Now may therefore be an ideal time to diversify into newer coins, with this article unpacking our best new meme coin to buy today, PEPENODE ($PEPENODE) , a new mining token that could surge upon listing in the next few weeks. Best New Meme Coin to Buy Today – 4 December PEPENODE has now raised an impressive $2.26 million in its ongoing presale, which opened a couple of months ago and is already doing a stellar job of attracting new investors. Its main pull is that it’s planning to do something which no coin or platform has done before, which is to provide users with the ability to mine tokens without needing traditional mining hardware. Mapping your next move in Pepenode isn’t flavor. It’s core gameplay that determines how fast you climb upgrade those Nodes! https://t.co/FaKIaBpf4I pic.twitter.com/vY69IDm3C1 — PEPENODE (@pepenode_io) November 27, 2025 Instead, users can simply use PEPENODE tokens to buy virtual mining nodes, which they can acquire in order to grow their own virtual mining rigs. They can use these rigs to mine external tokens, including Pepe and Fartcoin (more will come later). What’s interesting is that, by buying more nodes, upgrading and combining them, users can earn greater rewards. This dynamic should provide a strong incentive to buy more PEPENODE, so as to acquire more nodes, something which could boost the new token’s price over time. Nodes can be sold if a users want to reduce the size of their rig, or to close it completely, while they can also stake PEPENODE in order to obtain a passive income. At the moment, PEPENODE is providing a staking yield of 573% APY , making it one of the more profitable staking tokens in the market right now. PEPENODE has the Potential to Surge After Listing: How to Buy Given these features, and given the fact that PEPENODE’s sale has attracted substantial interest, it could surge when lists, which is why it’s our best new meme coin to buy today. Investors can buy it by going to its official website and connecting a compatible wallet, such as Best Wallet. They can buy any amount of PEPENODE they want, using ETH, USDT, BNB, or fiat (via debit/credit card). The token is currently selling at a price of $0.0011778, although this will rise again tomorrow and will continue to rise every three days until the sale closes. Because the market seems to be preparing for a big end-of-year rebound, PEPENODE may be timing its launch and listings perfectly. It has the potential to have a very big 2026, and could remain our best new meme coin to buy for a while yet.

Mullen suggested that users may be withdrawing their funds, and exchanges may be reorganizing. The network may also be experiencing broad restructuring. Outliers in The Trend At the same time, a few exceptions stood out. Evernorth, the recently launched XRP treasury operator , increased its holdings by more than 13%. Coincheck also reported a considerable rise of 550 million XRP. OKX registered a large percentage gain that may be linked to reclassified addresses.

While there are exceptions, the trend of shrinking supply has grown in recent months, with BitGo recently running out of tokens . Exchanges have fallen to 15.86 billion XRP, representing a decline of more than 6.5 billion XRP since early in the year. He noted that the trend suggests a contraction in available liquidity. However, he acknowledged that the findings have not been confirmed. Rich-List Activity and ETF Impact on Supply Mullen’s review of the XRP rich list showed continued activity among major holders, with the top 10,000 wallets now holding more than 51 billion XRP. New accounts acquired over 77 million XRP in a day, and existing wallets added nearly 18 million. Others released more than 108 million back into circulation. He said this reflects repositioning rather than exits. At the same time, XRP ETFs have gathered well over $800 million in inflows since mid-November. This represents over $400 million at XRP’s current price. This adds supply pressure and supports expectations of a larger market move.

Solana Price Predictions: Could Vanguard Fuel a $1000 Move This fresh touch point for inflows arrives as Solana flashes its strongest bottom signal yet with a double bottom pattern forming along a historic support trendline. The $120 level has marked local bottoms throughout the bullish phase of the market cycle, and it appears to act as a launchpad yet again as momentum indicators flip bullish.

The RSI is testing the neutral line after being trapped in oversold conditions for the past 2 months while the RSI builds a lead above the signal line. Both suggest that buyers are taking control of the prevailing trend. With a decisive break above the double bottom neckline at $144, the fully realised structure eyes a push to $210. This would trigger a retest of a wider year-long descending triangle pattern, creating a potential breakout scenario eyeing much higher targets around $500, a 250% gain.

As institutional appetite for blockchain tech keeps rising, this favors a bullish Ethereum price prediction . Antithesis, a firm based in North Carolina, received $105 million during its Series A funding round, led by Jane Street. A fast-growing Vienna software testing startup whose tools find bugs in computer programming code, has landed $100 million in a Series A fundraising round led by one its largest customers. https://t.co/ZuyFG9hJrF — Washington Business Journal (@WBJonline) December 3, 2025 According to Antithesis, they helped Ethereum during its transition to a proof-of-stake (PoS) consensus protocol through its advanced simulations and stress tests to ensure that the upgrade went through no matter what. Its systems can allegedly replay any bug that shows up during the deployment of new software. As a result, engineers can quickly identify exactly what went wrong to correct it immediately. As blockchain technology becomes stronger, smart contracts platforms like Ethereum will likely be adopted by big institutions. They are viewed as the infrastructure for the next generation of financial applications running on independent networks. Ethereum Price Prediction: Double Bottom Could Confirm the Begining of ETH’s Next Leg Up Ethereum (ETH) recently jumped after making a double bottom at $2,750. This confirms the relevance of this price level for market participants and justifies a bullish Ethereum price prediction. Source: TradingView In the past 24 hours alone, ETH has gained 4.2% while trading volumes remain high at $31 billion. This figure accounts for 8% of the token’s circulating market cap. In the daily chart, the Relative Strength Index (RSI) has also jumped above the mid-line. This means that positive momentum is accelerating. If the rally continues, a bullish breakout of the $3,350 resistance could confirm a trend reversal. This could result in a full-blown recovery for ETH that pushes the token back to $4,000 within the next few weeks. As cryptos start to recover, innovative crypto presales that further strengthen existing networks like Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) will likely capture the most upside. This layer-2 chain for Bitcoin leverages the power of the Solana blockchain to lower transaction costs and increase the network’s speed. Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) is Launching a Solana-Powered Layer for Bitcoin Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) is designed to eliminate the hurdles that have prevented the Bitcoin ecosystem from further growth.

The often-overlooked Bollinger Bands may be the clearest tell. After spending two months below the central basis line, the meme coin has finally broken above it as buyers return.

Pepe Price Prediction: The Strongest Bottom Signal Yet? This potential bottom appears to have taken shape as a double-bottom reversal, with a second bounce along the $0.000004 level now gaining momentum. Pepe now tests the pattern’s neckline at $0.0000049, a level that must flip to support to confirm the bullish setup. Momentum indicators support further upside. The MACD widens its gap above the signal line while the RSI approaches the 50 neutral line for the first time in two months, both signals that buyers are controlling the move. Fully realised, the pattern targets a measured 50% move to reclaim November highs at $0.0000075. But if this level can be flipped to support, it may mark the start of an extended rally. And with supportive market conditions, such as a U.S. interest rate ease in December to stimulate demand for riskier plays PEPE, it could push 240% to May highs at $0.0000165. Pepe Node: A Better Way to Buy the Dip If the past two months have proven anything, it’s that it can be difficult to buy the dip on volatile tokens like meme coins without leaving yourself exposed to heavy losses. PepeNode ($PEPENODE) helps with an easier way to accumulate, without needing to time the market — the pitfall of most meme coin investors. It’s a simple mine-to-earn (M2E) game. No hardware needed. Just log in, acquire virtual nodes, stack rigs, and configure your setup to start earning passive rewards, diversified across top-performing meme coins. Momentum is climbing fast. The presale has already passed $2.25 million, while early stakers can still earn up to 573% APY. And thanks to a built-in deflationary model, where 70% of all $PEPENODE spent on nodes and rigs is burned, scarcity supports long-term token value. PepeNode stands out as a smarter way to capture some of the market’s strongest upside—without worrying about timing the perfect entry.

His outlook for Bitcoin has prompted renewed debate within the XRP community, especially around how XRP could react if his target plays out. To reflect this shift in focus, the discussion now centers primarily on the relationship between Bitcoin’s projected strength and the potential scale of XRP’s response. Garlinghouse Predicts Bitcoin to Reach $180,000 While participating in a panel session with Binance CEO Richard Teng and Solana Foundation President Lily Liu, Garlinghouse delivered a headline-making prediction. He stated, “I’ll go out on a limb, and I’ll say, Bitcoin $180,000 Dec. 31, 2026.” His remark stands out as the only precise target among the speakers. Teng declined to provide any numerical forecast, emphasizing his long-term approach by saying, “I can’t make a price prediction…..I’m a long-term holder, so I’m not looking at short-term price volatility.” Liu’s outlook placed BTC above $100,000 , aligning with a generally strong trajectory but avoiding a specific figure. Garlinghouse’s assertive stance has since become the basis for new calculations within the XRP community , as several commentators believe XRP could experience amplified gains if Bitcoin achieves the projected rally. Historical Behavior of XRP During Bitcoin Rallies Community analyst Arthur revisited prior market cycles to outline why XRP might react more aggressively than Bitcoin if BTC advances toward the projected $180,000 level. According to him, altcoins such as XRP typically outperform BTC in percentage terms when Bitcoin doubles in price, often rising between threefold and fivefold during similar periods. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 There are two recent examples to support this pattern. In November 2024, Bitcoin climbed from $70,000 to $109,000, marking a 1.5x gain. Within that same window, XRP rose from $0.50 to $3.40, an increase of 6.8x. A comparable trend appeared again in July 2025 when Bitcoin advanced 8% to $115,750. XRP then surged 35% to $3.02, outperforming BTC by more than four times. These instances have strengthened the argument that XRP tends to record comparatively larger movements in moments of broad-market momentum. Possible XRP Price if Ripple CEO’s Forecast Plays Out Building on the CEO’s $180,000 target, Arthur has outlined a potential range for XRP if the pattern repeats. Based on previous multipliers, he estimates that XRP could move to the $6 to $10 region, representing a threefold to fivefold expansion from current levels, should Bitcoin meet Garlinghouse’s projection. His view aligns with the stance of analysts such as ChartNerd, who have also suggested that XRP may be positioned for a move toward the $10 threshold. It is generally assumed that higher outcomes could materialize if additional favorable conditions develop. In particular, the introduction of sustained real-world utility is often cited as a factor that could place XRP within a more elevated price range of $15 to $20. This aligns with broader expectations within the community, where many believe that substantial capital inflows into potential XRP-based exchange-traded funds could reinforce and extend a market rally.

Bitcoin, Ethereum, And Solana Build Powerful High-Time-Frame Structures",https://www.newsbtc.com/news/bitcoin-ethereum-and-solana-2/,"In the volatile theatre of the cryptocurrency market, Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Solana are showing signs of a potential high-time-frame reversal. After weeks of stress and price compression, each of the top assets is now stabilizing at key structural support levels. The multiple leading cryptocurrencies are flashing similar recovery setups at the same time. The current crypto landscape may be setting up one of the most powerful high-time-frame reversals across Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Solana. An investor and trader known as MacroCRG on X highlighted that yesterday, all three assets printed a bullish engulfing candle, a strong signal that buyers are stepping back in with intent. Market Leaders Hint At A Shift Before Smaller Assets Follow On the weekly chart, each asset is showing the early stages of an inside-week breakout paired with a false breakdown. MacroCRG pointed out that a similar structure on the ES (S&P 500 futures) chart from April, where the breakdown of inside-week structure led to a breakout that never looked back when the bull secured the weekly close.

However, there’s still a long way to go before the weekly close will confirm the breakout, and the bulls need to follow through with conviction and remove any doubt. The founder of the ProMintClub investment community, ProMint, has spotted a high-conviction whale trader aggressively building long positions across the crypto market. Currently, the trader is leading the Lighter leaderboard with over $64 million in profit and loss, while maintaining an 83% long bias. His Lighter account has the highest profit and loss with over $8 million. These are insane numbers compared to everyone else on the leaderboard. Data shows that the trader has made five deposits into his Lighter account, which total around $6 million in capital. His positions are spread across BTC, ETH, SOL, AAVE, along with smaller plays such as PAXG and PUMP, consistently entering at strong timing points and riding momentum higher. Even though funding costs have flipped heavily negative, he is not backing down. Presently, this is the top-performing account on Lighter, and this is serious capital deployed with conviction.

Hoskinson has shared a strategic game plan for 2026 that could significantly transform the Cardano ecosystem and potentially even influence the value of its native token. Although ADA’s price has underperformed other top altcoins so far this year, upcoming developments and shifts in 2026 could create a better environment for a potential recovery. Cardano 2026 Game Plan Offers Hope For ADA Price Recovery In a recent video posted on X, Hoskinson shared his thoughts on Cardano, offering a glimpse into the blockchain’s vision for 2026. According to the crypto founder, Cardano is preparing to enter the new year with a plan to become a powerful and exceptional blockchain network and the most relatable distribution system humanity has ever created. Hoskinson emphasized that achieving this vision will require significant time and effort, acknowledging that setbacks are part of building a complex system. He noted that bugs and mistakes are inevitable, but what distinguishes a successful project is how well and fast it responds and recovers. The Cardano founder also highlighted the importance of learning from errors and improving processes, suggesting that future obstacles will be overcome more quickly and effectively. While perfection is unattainable, Hoskinson’s statements reflect confidence in Cardano’s approach to problem-solving, adaptability, and its ongoing progress toward becoming a leading blockchain network. While the blockchain prepares to advance, it remains uncertain if an ADA price recovery will follow. Currently, the cryptocurrency is trading at $0.449, reflecting a 63% decline this year and a 16.6% drop over the past month. Compared to other altcoins like Ethereum and Solana, which reached new all-time highs earlier this year, ADA’s underperformance has been somewhat of a puzzle, especially given its previous ecosystem developments and strong community . Analyst Says ADA Price Will Be Mega Bullish If It Breaks This Level The Cardano price has been trending downward for months; however, analysts remain bullish on the cryptocurrency. According to crypto analyst ‘Sssebi’, ADA’s next key milestone is the $0.50 resistance level. If the altcoin can successfully breach this threshold, he predicts that Cardano could enter a “mega bullish phase.” Sssebi’s analysis highlights that despite Cardano’s price being significantly undervalued , its underlying structure still shows hints of bullishness. Breaking $0.50, therefore, could act as a psychological trigger that helps the altcoin overcome current bearishness and signal a much-anticipated recovery. The analyst suggested that ADA’s current price of $0.44 may represent a bottom level.

Among the findings in the briefing paper on “Understanding Stablecoins,” released on Thursday, the IMF examined how countries such as the United States, the United Kingdom, Japan, and the European Union have approached efforts to formulate regulatory frameworks for stablecoins. The IMF report highlighted that emerging regulations may help mitigate risks to macroeconomic and financial stability. However, it did identify an uneven environment that featured diverse regulatory approaches and issuance structures. The IMF stated on a social media platform that s tablecoins can expand financial access and drive innovation, but also cause currency substitution and market volatility. Global cooperation on regulation is essential. The Fund is working with the Financial Stability Board (FSB), the Bank for International Settlements (BIS), and others “to close gaps and improve oversight,” the IMF added. Is the expansion of stablecoins driving market inefficiencies and risks? The IMF said that the proliferation of new stablecoins across different blockchains and exchanges raises concerns about inefficiencies stemming from a potential lack of interoperability. The organization noted that this growth can create disparities and obstacles among countries due to varying regulatory frameworks and transactional hurdles. Although regulation of stablecoins helps authorities address [certain] risks, strong macro-policies and robust institutions should be the first line of defense […] International coordination remains key to solving these issues. IMF According to the report, the largest stablecoins by market capitalization, Tether’s USDT and Circle’s USDC, were “backed mostly” by short-term US Treasuries, reverse repo collateralized with US Treasuries , and bank deposits. Forty percent of USDC’s reserves and approximately 75% of USDt’s reserves consisted of short-term US Treasuries, with Tether’s stablecoin also holding 5% of its reserves in Bitcoin. The vast majority of stablecoins worldwide include coins pegged to the US dollar. However, a small number of issuers have denominated their offerings in different currencies, such as the euro. As of December, the total market exceeds $300 billion. US GENIUS Act and EU MiCA create divergent stablecoin frameworks Following the signing of the GENIUS Act into law by US President Donald Trump in July, regulators have been moving to establish a comprehensive framework for payment stablecoins in the United States. The law imposes strict reserve requirements, bans yield-bearing stablecoins , and formally integrates stablecoin issuers into the US financial system. A new report from blockchain security auditor CertiK indicates that America’s new approach to stablecoin regulation is reshaping global liquidity flows and driving a sharp structural split with the European Union’s Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA) regime, effectively creating separate US and EU stablecoin liquidity pools. According to the report, the US digital asset market entered a new phase of regulatory clarity in 2025, with federal legislation and administrative reforms now broadly aligned on how digital assets are issued, traded, and custodied. While the framework offers long-awaited regulatory certainty for US issuers, the report warns that it also deepens the global divide with the EU’s MiCA regime, creating a separate US liquidity pool and effectively fragmenting the global stablecoin market. For this reason, CertiK anticipates that stablecoin liquidity will become highly segmented by jurisdiction, which will give rise to new cross-border settlement issues and potentially lead to regional stablecoin arbitrage. Despite the MiCA regime of the European Union following the US GENIUS Act’s requirement for full redemption at par and prohibition on yield for stablecoins, it has met resistance due to the addition of banking concentration risk, as the rules mandate a substantial fraction of issuer reserves to be held within EU-based banks. Tether’s CEO, Paolo Ardoino, cautioned that such a structure could lead to “systemic risks” for issuers, as under the fractional reserve system, banks typically lend out a sizable portion of their deposits.

However, one of the world’s most prestigious institutions saw an opportunity. Harvard University significantly increased its Bitcoin holdings during the market downturn, according to recent reports. This move reveals how sophisticated investors approach cryptocurrency volatility differently than the average trader. How Did Harvard Buy Bitcoin During the Dip? Harvard Management Company, which oversees the university’s massive $57 billion endowment, executed a strategic accumulation plan. The institution reportedly began its intensive buying phase after Bitcoin’s price peaked in October. They acquired the digital asset as it fell approximately 17% through November, demonstrating classic “buy the dip” behavior at an institutional scale. The investment vehicle of choice was BlackRock’s Bitcoin Trust. This approach allows traditional institutions to gain Bitcoin exposure without dealing with direct custody challenges. Harvard’s move signals growing institutional comfort with cryptocurrency investment structures. What Does Harvard’s Bitcoin Investment Look Like? The numbers tell a compelling story of conviction buying. In the second quarter, Harvard reported holding 1.9 million shares of BlackRock’s Bitcoin Trust, valued at $116.7 million. Then came the strategic move that turned heads across financial markets. During the third quarter, Harvard tripled its position. The university now holds 6.8 million shares worth approximately $443 million. This substantial increase occurred precisely when many investors were reducing exposure or sitting on the sidelines. Consider these key aspects of Harvard’s Bitcoin strategy: Timing precision : Buying during a 17% price decline Scale : Moving from $116 million to $443 million in holdings Vehicle selection : Using established institutional products like BlackRock’s trust Conviction : Tripling position despite market uncertainty Why Would Harvard Invest in Bitcoin Now? Institutional investors like Harvard operate with different time horizons and risk parameters than retail traders. Their decision to buy Bitcoin during dips reflects several strategic considerations. First, endowment funds seek assets that can provide uncorrelated returns to traditional markets. Bitcoin has demonstrated this characteristic historically. Second, Harvard likely views cryptocurrency as a long-term store of value and hedge against monetary inflation. With a $57 billion endowment to protect, diversification into digital assets makes strategic sense. The university’s investment team has been studying cryptocurrency for years before making this substantial move. Third, the timing suggests Harvard believes in Bitcoin’s fundamental value proposition regardless of short-term price fluctuations. Buying during fear periods often generates the best long-term returns in volatile asset classes. What Can Retail Investors Learn from Harvard? Harvard bought Bitcoin using a method retail investors can emulate: dollar-cost averaging during downturns. While most people lack Harvard’s resources, the principles remain accessible. The key lesson is maintaining conviction during market turbulence when fundamentals remain strong. However, retail investors should note important differences. Harvard uses professional custody solutions and invests through regulated vehicles. They also conduct extensive due diligence that most individuals cannot replicate. Still, the psychological approach—buying when others are fearful—remains universally applicable. Actionable insights from Harvard’s move include: Develop an investment thesis before market volatility hits Allocate only what you can afford to hold long-term Use reputable platforms and custody solutions Ignore short-term noise focusing on long-term trends The Bigger Picture: Institutional Crypto Adoption Harvard’s substantial Bitcoin purchase represents more than just one institution’s trade. It signals broader acceptance of cryptocurrency within traditional finance. When prestigious universities allocate endowment funds to digital assets, other institutions take notice. This move follows similar investments by Yale, Stanford, and other elite universities. The trend suggests that cryptocurrency is transitioning from speculative asset to legitimate portfolio component. As more institutions follow Harvard’s lead, market structure and liquidity should improve for all participants. The most significant implication might be validation. When Harvard buys Bitcoin during dips, it communicates confidence in the asset class’s future. This psychological impact often matters as much as the financial investment itself. Conclusion: Wisdom in Volatility Harvard bought Bitcoin not despite the price decline, but because of it. Their strategic accumulation during November’s downturn demonstrates institutional sophistication in navigating cryptocurrency markets. While retail investors often react emotionally to price movements, Harvard’s endowment team executed a calculated plan based on long-term conviction. This move reinforces several important principles: volatility creates opportunity, timing matters less than time in the market, and institutional adoption continues accelerating. As cryptocurrency matures, watching how sophisticated players like Harvard navigate the space provides valuable lessons for all market participants. Frequently Asked Questions How much Bitcoin does Harvard University own? Harvard currently holds approximately $443 million worth of Bitcoin through BlackRock’s Bitcoin Trust, representing 6.8 million shares according to recent reports. When did Harvard start investing in Bitcoin? Harvard began accumulating Bitcoin more intensively after the price peaked in October, with significant purchases occurring during November’s 17% price decline. Why did Harvard choose BlackRock’s Bitcoin Trust? Institutional investors often prefer regulated investment vehicles that handle custody and compliance. BlackRock’s trust provides Bitcoin exposure without the operational complexities of direct ownership. Does Harvard’s investment mean Bitcoin is safe? No investment is completely safe, but Harvard’s substantial allocation suggests their investment committee sees favorable risk-reward characteristics in Bitcoin as part of a diversified portfolio. Should retail investors copy Harvard’s strategy? While the principle of buying during dips is sound, retail investors should consider their own risk tolerance, time horizon, and financial situation rather than blindly following any institution’s moves. What other universities invest in cryptocurrency? Yale, Stanford, MIT, and several other prestigious universities have allocated portions of their endowments to cryptocurrency and blockchain-related investments in recent years.

A wallet associated with global investment giant BlackRock has just received over $67 million worth of Bitcoin and Ethereum from leading exchange Coinbase. This transaction isn’t just a number on a screen; it’s a powerful signal about the future of digital assets. Let’s dive into what this means for the market and why the BlackRock wallet activity matters to every investor. What Does the $67.5M BlackRock Wallet Transfer Mean? According to data from Onchain lens, approximately five hours ago, a significant transfer occurred. A total of 153.83 BTC and 16,930 ETH, with a combined value of $67.48 million, moved from Coinbase to a wallet identified as belonging to BlackRock. This is not a random event. It represents a substantial, deliberate allocation by one of the world’s most influential financial institutions. Such a move from a traditional finance titan into crypto assets underscores a critical trend: institutional adoption is accelerating. When BlackRock makes a move, the entire financial world pays attention. Therefore, this transaction is a strong vote of confidence in the underlying value of Bitcoin and Ethereum. Why is the BlackRock Wallet Activity So Significant? BlackRock manages nearly $10 trillion in assets. Its investment decisions are meticulously researched and have a history of shaping market trajectories. The movement into this specific BlackRock wallet suggests a strategic accumulation, potentially for its iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) or other digital asset products. Consider the key implications of this activity: Market Validation: Large-scale purchases by institutions help legitimize cryptocurrencies as a viable asset class. Supply Pressure: Moving coins off an exchange like Coinbase into cold storage reduces immediate selling pressure, which can be bullish for prices. Future Confidence: It signals that major players are building long-term positions, not just trading short-term. How Does This Impact Bitcoin and Ethereum Investors? For everyday crypto holders, this news is more than a headline. It provides actionable insight. Institutional moves often precede broader market trends. The activity in the BlackRock wallet indicates that sophisticated investors see value at current levels and are positioning accordingly. Moreover, this reduces liquid supply on exchanges. With fewer coins readily available for sale, even modest increases in demand can lead to stronger price support. However, it’s crucial to remember that institutional investment also brings higher scrutiny and potential volatility from larger, coordinated trades. What’s Next for Institutional Crypto Adoption? This transaction is likely a single piece of a much larger puzzle. BlackRock’s public Bitcoin ETF has already seen tremendous inflows. This direct wallet activity suggests their involvement is deepening beyond publicly traded funds. We can expect other asset managers to follow suit, increasing overall demand for top-tier crypto assets. The path forward involves watching for similar movements from other institutions. Will Fidelity, Vanguard, or other giants make comparable allocations? The activity of the BlackRock wallet may have just set a new benchmark for institutional crypto strategy. Conclusion: A Defining Moment for Crypto Markets The transfer of $67.5 million in Bitcoin and Ethereum to a BlackRock wallet is a landmark event. It demonstrates that the world’s largest asset manager is not just dipping a toe but wading deeper into the crypto ecosystem. This move validates the asset class for skeptical traditional investors and provides a layer of stability and credibility. While past performance doesn’t guarantee future results, the signal from this transaction is clear: institutional capital is here to stay, and it’s building a foundation for the next chapter of finance. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: How do we know the wallet belongs to BlackRock? A1: Blockchain analytics firms like Onchain lens use a combination of publicly disclosed information, transaction patterns, and wallet labeling to identify entities. While not 100% infallible, these attributions are generally considered reliable within the crypto intelligence community. Q2: Does this mean BlackRock is buying Bitcoin and Ethereum directly? A2: Yes, this on-chain transfer indicates a direct purchase and withdrawal to a wallet they control, likely for holding as treasury assets or to support their ETF products. Q3: Why move funds from Coinbase to a private wallet? A3: Moving crypto off an exchange (to “cold storage”) is a standard security practice for long-term holders. It reduces counterparty risk and signifies an intent to hold, not trade frequently. Q4: Will this single transaction affect Bitcoin’s price? A4> While $67.5M is a large sum, the Bitcoin market cap is over $1 trillion. The psychological impact and signal it sends are more significant than the direct market impact of the trade itself. Q5: What is the difference between BlackRock’s ETF and this wallet activity? A5: The iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) is a publicly traded security that holds Bitcoin. This wallet activity could be separate treasury management or part of the fund’s operational movements to secure assets. Q6: Should I invest in crypto because BlackRock is? A6> Institutional activity is a strong data point, but it should not be your sole reason for investing. Always conduct your own research, understand the volatility, and ensure any investment aligns with your personal financial goals and risk tolerance.

Have you ever wondered if there’s a way to measure the market’s emotional pulse? The Crypto Fear & Greed Index does exactly that, and its latest reading offers a crucial glimpse into investor psychology. Today, the index has inched up to 28, a small but notable rise from yesterday. However, it remains firmly planted in the ‘Fear’ zone. This subtle shift begs the question: is this the first sign of a sentiment thaw, or just a temporary blip in a fearful market? What Exactly Is the Crypto Fear & Greed Index? Think of the Crypto Fear & Greed Index as the market’s mood ring. Created by data provider Alternative.me, it quantifies the emotional state of cryptocurrency investors on a simple scale from 0 to 100. A score of 0 screams ‘Extreme Fear,’ while 100 shouts ‘Extreme Greed.’ The current score of 28 tells us that, despite the recent uptick, apprehension still dominates trading floors and online forums. This tool is invaluable because it helps cut through the noise of daily price swings to reveal the underlying emotional driver. How Is This Crucial Index Calculated? The index isn’t based on a gut feeling. It’s a data-driven model that synthesizes information from six key market areas. This multi-source approach ensures a balanced and comprehensive view of sentiment. Volatility (25%): Sharp price drops increase fear, while stability can foster greed. Market Volume (25%): High volume during rallies suggests greed; high volume during sell-offs indicates fear. Social Media (15%): The tone and volume of conversations on platforms like Twitter and Reddit. Surveys (15%): Direct polling of market participants. Bitcoin Dominance (10%): Rising dominance often signals a ‘flight to safety’ and fear. Google Trends (10%): Search volume for terms like ‘Bitcoin crash’ or ‘buy crypto.’ Why Should You Care About a Score of 28? A reading of 28 on the Crypto Fear & Greed Index is more than just a number. For savvy investors, it represents a specific market phase. Historically, prolonged periods of extreme fear have often preceded significant buying opportunities. This is based on the contrarian investment principle: be fearful when others are greedy, and greedy when others are fearful. Therefore, while ‘Fear’ sounds negative, it can signal a market that is potentially oversold and due for a correction upward. However, it’s not a standalone buy signal. It must be used in conjunction with fundamental and technical analysis. Actionable Insights from the Current Fear Zone So, what does a fearful market mean for your portfolio? First, it suggests caution is still the prevailing wisdom. However, the two-point rise to 28 could indicate that the peak of panic may have passed. For long-term investors, this environment can be ideal for dollar-cost averaging—systematically investing a fixed amount at regular intervals regardless of price. This strategy reduces the impact of volatility. For traders, it’s a reminder to manage risk tightly, as sentiment-driven markets can reverse quickly. Always remember, the Crypto Fear & Greed Index is a tool for context, not a crystal ball. Conclusion: Navigating the Market’s Emotional Waves In summary, the Crypto Fear & Greed Index rising to 28 offers a nuanced view. The market is still fearful, but the slight improvement hints at a fragile hope. Understanding this sentiment gauge empowers you to separate emotion from strategy. By recognizing when fear is pervasive, you can make more disciplined, less reactive decisions. The true power lies not in following the crowd’s emotion, but in understanding it. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q: Who creates the Crypto Fear & Greed Index? A: The index is compiled and published by the data analytics website Alternative.me. Q: How often is the index updated? A: It is updated daily, providing a near real-time snapshot of market sentiment. Q: Is a ‘Fear’ reading always a good time to buy? A: Not necessarily. While it can indicate potential opportunity, it should not be used in isolation. Always conduct your own research and consider market fundamentals. Q: Does the index only track Bitcoin? A> While Bitcoin is a major component (via its dominance metric), the index factors in broader market data like volatility and social media, making it a gauge for the overall crypto market sentiment. Q: Where can I check the current Crypto Fear & Greed Index score? A: You can find it on the Alternative.me website or on many major cryptocurrency data platforms.

During this meeting, they expressed differing viewpoints on the effective ways the Securities and Exchange Commission should employ to oversee tokenization and the role decentralized finance (DeFi) should play in this process. This topic of discussion in the meeting was raised at a time when tokenization is rapidly gaining popularity among individuals. Some of the executives who were present at the meeting were from firms such as Citadel Securities , Coinbase, and Galaxy. Notably, tokenization refers to converting various types of assets, particularly real-world ones, into digital representations and placing them on the blockchain. Tokenization has emerged as a transformative trend in finance, enabling fractional ownership of assets ranging from equities and bonds to real estate and fine art. By representing these assets digitally on blockchain networks, investors can trade and access them with greater transparency and speed, reducing reliance on traditional intermediaries. As a result, both established financial institutions and crypto-native firms are increasingly exploring tokenized markets. The role of this panel is to guide the commission on regulations and what matters most to investors. The SEC’s meeting ignites debates in the industry Once the SEC Investor Advisory Committee meeting concluded, Samara Cohen, a senior managing director and global head of market development at BlackRock, summarized the various viewpoints highlighted during the meeting. She began by acknowledging that the presence of a six-person panel was useful in demonstrating “distinct paths and perspectives.” According to Cohen, these varying viewpoints highlighted the current problems in the industry and suggested the likelihood of more than one solution, making it an important aspect of the meeting. The SEC meeting was held just one day after some crypto enthusiasts responded negatively to a letter submitted by Citadel Securities on Wednesday this week. Following their response, the big market maker faced criticism online from certain individuals in the crypto community. This criticism arose after the market maker proposed that the SEC implement stricter regulations on decentralized finance concerning tokenized securities. When reporters reached out to Citadel Securities for comment on the matter, the American market-making firm mentioned there is an urgency for the agency to clearly identify all intermediaries participating in the trading of tokenized US stocks. This included decentralized trading protocols. They also urged against giving broad exemptions from legal definitions of “exchange” and “broker-dealer.” Other members of the crypto industry have also weighed in on Citadel Securities’ argument. These crypto supporters disagreed with this stance, arguing that such a position is “unworkable.” According to their argument, decentralized finance operates differently from traditional finance, as it does not utilize direct intermediaries, making it challenging to adhere to the same regulations. Jonah Platt argues the need for a rule-by-rule approach in the crypto industry Jonah Platt, managing director and US head of government and regulatory policy at Citadel Securities, mentioned that “To be clear, we think that tokenizing US equities has great potential and can further benefit investors.” However, he cautioned that providing a broad-ranging exemption for DeFi could harm investors within the ecosystem. Therefore, to address this situation, Platt suggested that the effective way is to identify unreasonable rules present and work on changing them. “But the idea of simply granting sweeping exemptions without analyzing each rule seems very risky to us because the US equity market is so crucial — we should ensure we get this right,” he added. Regarding his remarks, Scott Bauguess, Vice President for Global Regulatory Policy at Coinbase, chose to comment on the topic of discussion. Bauguess expressed his agreement with Platt’s rule-by-rule approach. Based on his perspective, this approach is necessary for the ecosystem; however, he pointed out that the regulations for decentralized exchanges should not be identical to those for brokers.

The project has destroyed a staggering $80 million worth of ASTER tokens from its dedicated buyback wallet. This decisive action, first reported by Solid Intel, follows the official launch of its Stage 4 buyback program on December 2nd. For investors and DeFi enthusiasts, this move raises a crucial question: what does burning such a huge sum really mean for the future of ASTER? What Does It Mean When Aster Burns $80M in ASTER Tokens? Simply put, a token burn is a permanent removal of coins from circulation. Think of it as a company buying back its own shares and then destroying them. Therefore, when Aster burns $80M in ASTER tokens , it actively reduces the total available supply. This is a common strategy in crypto to create scarcity, which, according to basic economic principles, can support the price of the remaining tokens if demand holds steady or increases. Breaking Down the Stage 4 Buyback Program The recent burn is not an isolated event. It is a direct result of Aster’s pre-announced Stage 4 buyback initiative. Here’s how such a program typically works: Revenue Generation: The exchange earns fees from trades on its platform. Fund Allocation: A portion of this revenue is allocated to a special “buyback wallet.” Token Acquisition & Destruction: The funds in this wallet are used to purchase ASTER tokens from the open market, which are then sent to a verifiable “burn address”—a wallet from which they can never be retrieved. This process creates a positive feedback loop: more trading activity generates more fees, which fuels more buybacks and burns, potentially increasing the value of each remaining token. Why Would a Project Destroy Its Own Tokens? You might wonder why a project would willingly destroy millions of dollars in assets. The rationale is strategic and aims to build long-term trust. The decision for Aster to burn $80M in ASTER tokens sends several powerful signals to the market: Confidence in Sustainability: It shows the project is generating real revenue and is financially healthy enough to forgo this capital. Commitment to Token Holders: It aligns the project’s success directly with the token’s value, benefiting long-term supporters. Combating Inflation: It counteracts the inflationary effect of new tokens that might be released as rewards or incentives. In essence, it’s a move designed to transition the token from a mere utility asset to a deflationary store of value within its ecosystem. The Potential Impact and Key Considerations While the theory behind a burn is sound, the real-world impact depends on several factors. A successful token burn like this can boost investor sentiment and attract new attention. However, it is not a magic bullet. The fundamental health of the Aster exchange—its user growth, trading volume, and product innovation—remains the ultimate driver of value. A burn amplifies positive fundamentals but cannot compensate for a weak product. Conclusion: A Calculated Gamble for Long-Term Growth Aster’s dramatic move to burn $80 million in tokens is a bold statement of self-belief. It demonstrates a shift from pure growth to sustainable value creation, putting its capital where its mouth is. While the immediate market reaction can vary, this strategic reduction in supply places a stronger foundation beneath the ASTER token. The success of this bold move will ultimately be judged by the platform’s ability to continue growing and justifying the increased scarcity it has engineered. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q: What is a token burn? A: A token burn is the permanent removal of cryptocurrency tokens from circulation by sending them to an unrecoverable wallet address, reducing the total supply. Q: Why did Aster burn $80M in tokens? A: Aster burned the tokens as part of its Stage 4 buyback program to reduce supply, create scarcity, and potentially increase the value of the remaining ASTER tokens, demonstrating confidence in its revenue model. Q: Does a token burn guarantee the price will go up? A: No, it does not guarantee a price increase. While it reduces supply, the price ultimately depends on market demand, overall sentiment, and the project’s continued success and utility. Q: Where can I verify that the Aster token burn happened? A: You can verify the transaction on a blockchain explorer by looking up the burn address or the buyback wallet address mentioned in Aster’s official announcements. Q: What is a buyback program in crypto? A: A buyback program is when a project uses its revenue or treasury funds to purchase its own tokens from the open market, often followed by burning them or locking them away. Q: How does this benefit ASTER token holders? A: Existing holders benefit from a reduced supply, which can lead to increased scarcity and potential price appreciation if demand remains constant or grows. It also shows the project is investing in the token’s long-term value. Found this deep dive into Aster’s major token burn insightful?

A massive batch of Bitcoin options expire , representing a staggering $3.4 billion in notional value. This event, scheduled for 8:00 a.m. UTC on December 5th, is a key moment that could influence short-term price action and trader sentiment across the entire digital asset space. What Happens When $3.4B in Bitcoin Options Expire? When options contracts reach their expiration date, holders must decide to exercise their right to buy or sell, or let the contract become worthless. This large-scale expiry creates a focal point for market forces. Data from leading exchange Deribit shows this batch has a put/call ratio of 0.91 and a “max pain” price of $91,000. But what do these terms actually mean for you? Put/Call Ratio (0.91): This metric shows nearly equal numbers of put (bet on price drop) and call (bet on price rise) options. A ratio below 1.0 often indicates a slightly more bullish sentiment among options traders. Max Pain Price ($91,000): This is the price at which the maximum number of options would expire worthless, causing the most financial “pain” to options buyers. It can act as a temporary gravitational pull for the spot price. Ethereum Joins the Expiry Frenzy It’s not just Bitcoin in the spotlight. A significant $660 million in Ethereum options are set to expire simultaneously. These contracts show a put/call ratio of 0.78 and a max pain price of $3,050. The lower put/call ratio suggests options traders for ETH are exhibiting even stronger bullish leanings compared to BTC ahead of this expiry event. This dual expiry creates a compounded effect on the market. Large traders and institutions with positions in both assets may execute coordinated hedging or closing strategies, potentially increasing volatility. Therefore, watching both markets is crucial today. How Could This Options Expiry Impact Bitcoin’s Price? The immediate impact of an options expire event often revolves around the max pain price. Market makers—the entities that provide liquidity—often hedge their risk by buying or selling the underlying asset. As expiry approaches, they may unwind these positions, which can push the spot price toward the max pain level to minimize their own losses. However, this is not a guaranteed rule. Strong external news or overwhelming spot market buying/selling pressure can easily override this effect. The key takeaway is to expect potentially heightened volatility and watch for unusual trading volume around the 8:00 a.m. UTC mark as positions are settled. Actionable Insights for Crypto Traders Navigating an options expire day requires a calm strategy. First, avoid making impulsive trades based solely on the expiry. Use it as one data point among many. Second, monitor trading volume and order book depth on major spot exchanges. Third, remember that the market’s reaction is often most pronounced in the hours immediately before and after the expiry time. For long-term investors, these events are typically noise. Short-term traders, however, should be aware of the potential for rapid price swings and ensure their risk management—like stop-loss orders—is firmly in place. Conclusion: A Pivotal Moment for Market Sentiment Today’s multi-billion dollar Bitcoin options expire is more than just a derivatives settlement. It acts as a live stress test for current market sentiment and liquidity. The resulting price action will offer valuable clues about the balance of power between bulls and bears. While the max pain price provides a theoretical focal point, the true direction will be determined by the broader market’s conviction. By understanding the mechanics, traders can observe this event not with anxiety, but with informed perspective. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q: What does ‘notional value’ mean in options? A: Notional value is the total value of the underlying asset controlled by the options contracts. The $3.4B figure is calculated by multiplying the number of contracts by the strike price, not the premium paid. Q: Is a put/call ratio of 0.91 bullish or bearish? A: Generally, a ratio below 1.0 (more calls than puts) is considered bullish for options market sentiment, while a ratio above 1.0 is considered bearish. Q: What happens to options that expire “in the money”? A: Options that are in-the-money (ITM) are typically automatically exercised by the exchange, meaning the holder of a call option will buy the asset, and the holder of a put option will sell it, at the agreed strike price. Q: Can retail traders influence the max pain price? A> It’s highly unlikely. The max pain price is primarily influenced by large institutions and market makers who hold significant opposing positions and engage in complex hedging activities. Q: How often do these large Bitcoin options expire? A: Major quarterly and monthly expiry events like this one happen regularly, often on the last Friday of the month or at the end of a quarter, and are closely watched by the market.

Alongside the familiar streams of foreign exchange rates and stock indices, you now see a new, dynamic data point: the live price of Bitcoin. This is the new reality at Woori Bank, marking a pivotal moment for institutional adoption in Asia. The integration of a Woori Bank Bitcoin price feed into its main dealing room isn’t just a minor update; it’s a powerful signal that digital assets are becoming part of the mainstream financial fabric. What Does Woori Bank’s Bitcoin Move Really Mean? According to a report by Maeil Business Newspaper, South Korea’s Woori Bank has begun displaying Bitcoin prices on the primary display board of its Seoul dealing room. This board is the central nervous system for traders, where critical market data converges. Therefore, placing Bitcoin alongside the Korean Won, US Dollar, and KOSPI index grants it unprecedented legitimacy within a traditional financial institution. This move is far from isolated. It reflects a strategic shift among South Korea’s financial giants. For instance, just days earlier on December 3rd, Hana Financial Group partnered with Dunamu, the operator of the Upbit exchange, to explore blockchain for services like overseas remittances. Together, these actions paint a clear picture: major banks are no longer just observing crypto—they are actively engaging with it. Why Is This a Game-Changer for Institutional Adoption? The Woori Bank Bitcoin price feed serves multiple crucial purposes. First, it normalizes cryptocurrency as a legitimate asset class for institutional investors and corporate clients. Second, it provides essential real-time data for banks that may be considering: Custody services for digital assets. Creating Bitcoin-linked investment products . Facilitating corporate treasury diversification into crypto. Moreover, this visibility reduces the knowledge gap. Bankers and traders can monitor Bitcoin’s volatility and correlations with traditional markets in real-time, fostering a deeper, data-driven understanding. This practical exposure is often the first step toward more substantive financial products and services. What Challenges Do Traditional Banks Face with Crypto? While the trend is promising, integration is not without hurdles. Regulatory clarity in South Korea, though improving, remains a complex landscape for traditional finance entities. Banks must navigate strict anti-money laundering (AML) and know-your-customer (KYC) requirements in a digital asset context. Furthermore, the inherent volatility of Bitcoin poses risk management challenges. Banks are inherently risk-averse institutions. Therefore, adopting crypto requires robust new frameworks for valuation, security, and compliance. The Woori Bank Bitcoin display can be seen as a low-risk, high-impact first step—testing the waters by integrating data before moving to hold assets or execute trades. What Can We Learn from This Trend? The actionable insight here is clear: institutional adoption is becoming a practical reality, not just a theoretical discussion. For investors, this signals growing long-term confidence in the crypto infrastructure. For the industry, it underscores the importance of building bridges with regulated entities. South Korea, with its tech-savvy population and high crypto engagement, is becoming a leading indicator. When major banks like Woori take visible steps, it often precedes a wave of similar actions globally. The focus is shifting from “if” to “how” traditional finance will incorporate digital assets. Conclusion: A Defining Moment for Finance The addition of a Woori Bank Bitcoin price feed is a small change with massive implications. It represents the quiet erosion of the wall between traditional and digital finance. This move, coupled with Hana Bank’s blockchain partnership, confirms that South Korea’s financial leaders are not waiting on the sidelines. They are preparing for a future where cryptocurrency is a standard component of a diversified financial ecosystem. The message to the world is unmistakable: institutional adoption is accelerating, and the landscape of finance is changing for good. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What exactly did Woori Bank do with Bitcoin? A1: Woori Bank started displaying the live Bitcoin price on the main data screen in its central dealing room in Seoul, alongside traditional data like forex rates and stock indices. Q2: Why is displaying a Bitcoin price feed significant? A2: It legitimizes Bitcoin as a serious financial asset within a conservative institution, provides crucial data for potential services, and signals broader institutional acceptance. Q3: Is Woori Bank trading or holding Bitcoin? A3: The report only confirms the display of price data. This is typically a first step before a bank offers custody, trading, or investment products related to cryptocurrencies. Q4: Are other South Korean banks involved in crypto? A4: Yes. For example, Hana Financial Group recently signed a deal with Upbit’s operator, Dunamu, to apply blockchain technology to banking services like international remittances. Q5: What does this mean for the average crypto investor? A5: It indicates growing institutional confidence, which can lead to more stability, new investment products, and broader mainstream acceptance of cryptocurrencies over time. Q6: What are the main hurdles for banks adopting crypto? A6: Key challenges include navigating evolving regulations, managing the asset’s volatility, and implementing strong security and compliance (AML/KYC) frameworks for digital assets.

Although SOL is a prominent name in the space, traders are now increasingly wondering if its next leg up is going to be as explosive as its previous instances, especially when faced with growing competition and the onset of new money entering the space to move towards newer assets that have greater asymmetry. This is now creating a new space for newer assets to enter, and one name that’s quickly moving up the list is that of Mutuum Finance (MUTM) . Available for a mere $0.035, this latest new crypto coin is now rallying heavily on analysts’ suggestions of a possible 50x increase, fueled by a rapidly growing base and a nearly complete presale event. With above $19.1 million, raised for its purpose-driven DeFi structure, MUTM is now increasingly being touted to be the top crypto of the current cycle, capable of overcoming even the most prominent giants of the crypto world in its next leg up. Solana Price Analysis: Short-Term Volatility & Long-Term Stability Solana’s price has registered significant short-term volatility, oscillating between $135 and $138. Notably, there was a sudden spike and then a plummet, representing a reaction to market dynamics that can be attributed to short-term trading activities or news events. However, reviewing the price trend, which is reflected at the bottom of the graph, there have been minimal positive trends since 2023, implying that although there is short-term volatility, Solana’s price trend is actually reflected within a positive range that represents its intrinsic value. Phase 6 Presale Almost Finished Amid High Demand The presale of Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is gathering even more momentum as Phase 6 draws closer to an end. Made to cater to different pricing levels and allocation sizes, the ongoing presale has continuously offered early supporters lower entry costs. Although its initial price was only $0.01 set for Phase 1, the price of MUTM is now at $0.035 for Phase 6, a 250% increase from where it all began. Thus far, the presale has managed to accumulate a total of $19.1 million, and the number of holders within the community now exceeds 18,310. Given that Phase 6 is now 95% sold out, the available supply at this price is extremely limited. In fact, Phase 7 is set to bring a price increase of 20%, making this current phase the last opportunity to acquire MUTM at $0.035. This makes $MUTM one of the most sought-after top crypto opportunities available and the most attractive new crypto coin for early adoption before the next phase begins. Creating a Comprehensive DeFi Ecosystem Mutuum Finance is a fully decentralized liquidity protocol. It enables users to lend, borrow, and interact with on-chain markets, giving them complete control of their assets. It uses a dual lending system that provides flexibility, ease of access, and efficiency to its users. The operation of the Peer-to-Contract (P2C) system is made possible through pooled liquidity markets, where contributors can lock their assets to earn mtTokens, proportionate to the asset value, that is, 1:1. The purpose of these tokens is to act as yield-bearing receipts, such that their value escalates as a result of borrowed money from the liquidity pool. When it comes to non-core assets that may not be suitable for conventional pooled market assets, Mutuum Finance supports a Peer-to-Peer lending platform. Through this platform, users can create a separate contract for non-standard or highly volatile assets, thus enhancing the asset base without undermining the stability of the liquidity pool. For those interested, one up-and-coming cryptocurrency that is well on its way to creating a decentralized future for crypto users is Mutuum Finance, going for a mere price of $0.035.

The latest data reveals a stark reality: the Altcoin Season Index is stuck at a mere 23. This critical metric, a beacon for crypto traders, continues to flash a strong signal of Bitcoin dominance , suggesting the king of crypto isn’t ready to relinquish its throne just yet. Let’s decode what this means for your portfolio and the broader market cycle. What Exactly Is the Altcoin Season Index Telling Us? CoinMarketCap’s Altcoin Season Index provides a clear, data-driven snapshot of market leadership. It works by comparing the 90-day price performance of the top 100 cryptocurrencies (excluding stablecoins) against Bitcoin itself. The magic number is 75. For a true “altcoin season” to be declared, at least 75% of these major altcoins must outperform Bitcoin over that three-month period. A score of 23, unchanged from the previous day, is a long way from that threshold. Therefore, this low score is a powerful indicator that capital and investor confidence are still heavily concentrated in Bitcoin. Why Does Bitcoin Dominance Persist? Several key factors are contributing to the sustained Bitcoin dominance reflected in the low Altcoin Season Index . Understanding these forces is crucial for any investor. Macroeconomic Hedge: In times of economic uncertainty, investors often flock to Bitcoin as a perceived digital gold and store of value, viewing it as a safer bet than more speculative altcoins. Institutional Focus: Major financial institutions and new spot Bitcoin ETFs are primarily channeling capital into Bitcoin first, reinforcing its lead. Market Cycle Phase: Historically, Bitcoin rallies first in a new bull cycle. Its strength often needs to consolidate before capital rotates into altcoins, which typically happens later. Risk Appetite: A low index score suggests that overall market risk appetite remains cautious, favoring the relative stability of the largest crypto asset. How Can Traders Use This Information? A stagnant Altcoin Season Index is not just a news headline; it’s a tactical tool. For savvy traders, this data informs strategy. It suggests that, for now, portfolio allocation might wisely favor Bitcoin or Bitcoin-centric investments. It also helps set realistic expectations for altcoin investments, indicating that broad-based, explosive gains across the altcoin market may not be imminent. Instead, outperformance is likely to be selective and sector-specific. Monitoring this index weekly can help you spot the early signs of a shift, signaling when it might be time to rebalance. When Will the Altcoin Season Finally Arrive? This is the million-dollar question. While the Altcoin Season Index is low today, it is a dynamic metric. A shift typically requires a combination of Bitcoin price stability or consolidation, increased overall market liquidity, and a surge in investor confidence to seek higher-risk, higher-reward opportunities. Watch for the index to climb steadily past 50 and toward the critical 75 level. When it does, it could unleash a wave of opportunity across the crypto ecosystem. In conclusion, the Altcoin Season Index holding firm at 23 is a clear message from the market: patience is essential. Bitcoin’s dominance remains the defining narrative, shaping capital flows and investor behavior. While this may delay the altcoin frenzy many anticipate, it provides a disciplined framework for investment. By understanding and respecting this signal, you can navigate the current landscape with clarity and position yourself to act decisively when the index finally begins its meaningful ascent. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What is a good score on the Altcoin Season Index? A score above 75 indicates a strong altcoin season is underway. A score below 25, like the current 23, signals strong Bitcoin dominance. Q2: Does a low index mean I shouldn’t buy any altcoins? Not necessarily. It means broad, market-wide altcoin outperformance is unlikely. It’s a time for selective, research-driven investments in specific projects rather than expecting all altcoins to rise together. Q3: How often is the Altcoin Season Index updated? The index is typically updated daily, providing a near real-time pulse on the relationship between Bitcoin and altcoin performance. Q4: Has the index ever been wrong about predicting altcoin season? The index is a lagging indicator based on past 90-day performance, not a prediction. It confirms a trend that is already happening. It won’t predict the start of a season but will confirm when one has begun. Q5: Where can I check the Altcoin Season Index? The index is publicly available on CoinMarketCap’s website under their market data or research sections. Q6: Do all altcoins move based on this index? No. The index measures the top 100. Smaller, more volatile altcoins (“small-cap alts”) can experience rallies independently, but sustained, major capital rotation is signaled by this index.

Ethereum Sharks Have Added 450,000 ETH Since Mid-November According to data from on-chain analytics firm Santiment, the supply of the Ethereum sharks has gone up recently. The indicator of relevance here is the “Supply Distribution,” measuring the total amount of tokens that a given wallet group as a whole is holding right now. Related Reading: Next Key XRP Level Could Be $1.2 If Current Support Fails, Says Analyst In the context of the current topic, the cohort of focus is the one corresponding to a coin range of 1,000 to 10,000 ETH. At the current exchange rate, the lower bound of the range roughly converts to $3.2 million and the upper one to $32 million. Investors of this large size are popularly known as the sharks. While not as massive as the whales (addresses with more than 10,000 ETH), the sharks are still considered influential entities. This can make their behavior often worth keeping an eye on. As the chart below, shared by Santiment, suggests, the latest Ethereum shark behavior has been one of accumulation. During the November price decline, the Supply Distribution had been going down for the Ethereum sharks, but around the time of the market bottom, its trend began to reverse. Between November 18th and December 2nd, the sharks added a total of 450,000 ETH (worth about $1.4 billion) to their wallets, a massive amount. Alongside this sharp uptick in the metric, ETH went through its price recovery. The cryptocurrency’s sharp retrace to start December didn’t dissuade these large hands, either, as their supply only continued to rise. This may be one of the factors behind the quick resumption of bullish momentum that the asset has seen. Another bullish factor has been the trend in the Network Growth, another on-chain indicator displayed in the chart. This metric measures the daily number of addresses that are coming online on the Ethereum network for the first time. A wallet is considered “online” when it participates in transaction activity on the blockchain, so the Network Growth essentially tracks the addresses making their very first transfer. From the graph, it’s visible that this Ethereum metric has also surged recently, hitting a peak value of 190,000 addresses. Generally, a surge in network activity is usually a positive sign for any rally’s sustainability, as it implies that the network is able to attract fresh attention.

It now remains to be seen whether the sharks will continue to buy in the near future and if investor FOMO will remain at healthy levels. ETH Price At the time of writing, Ethereum is floating around $3,185, up more than 5% over the last seven days.

Bitcoin Bear Market Incoming? Sharing a composite on-chain dashboard overlaid on the BTC price, Ju wrote on X: “Most Bitcoin on-chain indicators are bearish. Without macro liquidity, we enter a bear cycle.” The chart stacks ten CryptoQuant metrics behind the price in a red-to-green heatmap from 2021 to 2025, highlighting how regime shifts in prior cycles coincided with clusters of bearish readings. Related Reading: US Sen. Lummis Hints At US Bitcoin Buy With ‘Franklin’ Meme The indicators in the panel include the MVRV Z-score, CryptoQuant P&L Index, the Bull-Bear Cycle Indicator, Inter-Exchange Flow Pulse, Network Activity Index, Stablecoin Liquidity, Bitcoin Demand Growth, Trader On-chain Profit Margin, Trader Realized Price and a Technical Signal metric. When the majority are bullish, the backdrop turns light green; when they flip bearish, it shifts to red. In the latest section of the chart, as BTC has pulled back from its highs, red once again dominates – the visual basis for Ju’s warning. For the next major move, Ju argues that on-chain data is now subordinate to macro conditions and ETF flows. Quoting his own post, he wrote: “It is simple. If you think macro gets better next year, you buy. Otherwise, you sell. I’m not a macro expert, so find macro bros. New ETF inflows are the key.” That line pinpoints what he believes can “save” Bitcoin from a deeper drawdown: renewed demand from spot ETFs as a conduit for institutional capital. In earlier stages of the cycle, rising ETF inflows coincided with strong price appreciation; more recently, slowing or negative flows have mirrored the loss of upward momentum. Ju frames the current environment as one that demands flexible scenario management rather than rigid forecasts. “At this stage, it is more about being reactive than predictive. Set your scenarios and trade accordingly,” he told followers. The composite chart is designed for exactly that purpose, showing how past bull tops and bear markets aligned with persistent stretches of red across profit, valuation and liquidity metrics. Related Reading: Bitcoin And The 2026 Fed Shift: Expert Says Markets Aren’t Ready Despite the bearish tilt, Ju does not foresee a repeat of the 2022 collapse, when Bitcoin fell roughly 65% from peak to trough. He cites the behaviour of Michael Saylor led Strategy as a stabilizing factor. “If Strategy holds its 650K BTC this cycle (or sells only a little), we would not see another -65% drawdown like in 2022,” he wrote. In his view, that supply remaining largely off the market reduces the probability of a violent deleveraging event. Ju characterizes the current pullback as substantial but not extreme in historical context. “We are about -25% from ATH now, and even if a bear cycle comes, the downside would likely be smaller and look more like a broad sideways range,” he argued, suggesting that prolonged consolidation is more likely than a single dramatic crash. His message to long-term investors is explicitly calming. “Long-term holders should avoid panic selling,” he advised. While cyclical on-chain indicators flash red, he insists the structural backdrop has improved: “Bitcoin has more liquidity channels now, so the long-term outlook is obviously strong, imo.” Those channels include ETFs and a deeper institutional market structure than in prior cycles. At press time, Bitcoin traded at $92,494.

The Chicago Tribune’s lawsuit against Perplexity AI represents more than just another copyright case; it’s a watershed moment for AI search engines and their relationship with traditional publishers. For crypto enthusiasts watching decentralized content platforms evolve, this legal showdown reveals the complex terrain where artificial intelligence meets intellectual property rights. Why the Chicago Tribune is Suing Perplexity AI On December 4, 2025, the Chicago Tribune filed a federal lawsuit in New York against Perplexity AI, alleging systematic copyright infringement. According to court documents reviewed by Bitcoin World, the newspaper claims Perplexity’s AI search engine is improperly using Tribune content without permission or compensation. This legal action follows similar lawsuits against OpenAI and Microsoft filed earlier in 2025 by MediaNews Group and Tribune Publishing, which owns the Chicago Tribune. The core allegations include: Unauthorized use of Tribune content in Perplexity’s Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) systems Bypassing the newspaper’s paywall through Perplexity’s Comet browser Delivering verbatim or near-verbatim summaries of protected articles Scraping content without proper licensing agreements The RAG Systems Controversy: AI’s Copyright Achilles Heel Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) represents a significant advancement in AI technology designed to reduce hallucinations by grounding responses in verified data sources. However, the Chicago Tribune’s lawsuit specifically targets this technology as the primary mechanism of alleged infringement. The newspaper argues that Perplexity’s RAG systems are essentially sophisticated content scrapers that repurpose journalistic work without proper attribution or compensation. This legal challenge raises fundamental questions: Technology Purpose Legal Challenge RAG Systems Improve accuracy by using verified sources Alleged unauthorized content use Comet Browser Enhanced AI-powered browsing Paywall circumvention claims AI Summarization Condense information for users Copyright infringement allegations Perplexity AI’s Growing Legal Challenges The Chicago Tribune lawsuit isn’t an isolated incident for Perplexity AI. The company faces mounting legal pressure from multiple directions: Reddit Lawsuit (October 2025): Alleging unauthorized use of forum content Dow Jones Case: Similar copyright infringement claims Amazon Cease and Desist: Threats over AI browser shopping features Media Industry Pattern: 17 publications sued OpenAI/Microsoft in April 2025 What makes this wave of litigation particularly significant for the crypto community is the parallel with blockchain-based content platforms. As decentralized media projects develop their own AI integrations, the outcomes of these cases could establish crucial precedents for how AI interacts with protected content in Web3 environments. Copyright Infringement: The Legal Battlefield Expands The Chicago Tribune’s legal strategy reveals a sophisticated understanding of AI technology. Rather than focusing solely on model training—the subject of many previous AI lawsuits—the newspaper is targeting the operational systems that deliver content to users. This approach could have far-reaching implications for how AI companies design their products and services. Key legal arguments in the case: Whether RAG systems constitute “fair use” or require licensing If paywall bypassing violates terms of service and copyright law How courts will define “non-verbatim factual summaries” versus infringement The liability of AI companies for how their systems retrieve and present content AI Search Engine Legal Precedents in the Making This lawsuit arrives at a critical juncture for AI search engines. As these platforms become more sophisticated in how they access and present information, the legal framework governing their operations remains uncertain. The Chicago Tribune case could help establish important boundaries that will shape the future of AI-powered search. For cryptocurrency projects developing similar technologies, several considerations emerge: Content licensing models for AI training and retrieval Transparency in data sourcing and usage Technical measures to respect access controls and paywalls Revenue sharing models with content creators FAQs: Understanding the Legal Landscape What is Perplexity AI? Perplexity AI is an artificial intelligence search engine that uses advanced language models to provide conversational answers to user queries. Unlike traditional search engines that return links, Perplexity generates direct responses while citing sources. What is Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG)? RAG is a technique that enhances AI responses by retrieving information from external knowledge sources before generating answers. This approach aims to improve accuracy and reduce “hallucinations”—incorrect information generated by AI models. Who is involved in these lawsuits? Chicago Tribune : A major American daily newspaper based in Chicago, Illinois. Perplexity AI : An AI search engine company facing multiple copyright lawsuits. OpenAI : Previously sued by the same publishing group in April 2025. Microsoft : Co-defendant with OpenAI in the earlier lawsuit. How does this affect cryptocurrency projects? Many blockchain projects are developing AI integrations or content platforms. The legal precedents established in these cases could influence how decentralized applications handle content licensing, attribution, and compensation in AI-driven environments. The Bottom Line: A Turning Point for AI and Content The Chicago Tribune’s lawsuit against Perplexity AI represents more than a simple copyright dispute—it’s a fundamental challenge to how AI systems access and utilize protected content. As artificial intelligence becomes increasingly integrated into search and information retrieval, establishing clear legal boundaries becomes essential for both innovation and rights protection. For the cryptocurrency and blockchain community, these legal battles offer crucial insights into the evolving relationship between technology and content rights. As decentralized platforms explore AI integrations, understanding these legal parameters will be essential for building sustainable, compliant systems that respect intellectual property while leveraging artificial intelligence’s capabilities.

This year’s flagship event in Las Vegas moved beyond simple AI assistants, declaring a new era where AI agents work independently for days, learn from your team, and drive tangible business returns. For the crypto and tech communities watching, the implications are profound, signaling a massive infrastructure shift that could power the next generation of decentralized applications and intelligent platforms. The focus was squarely on giving enterprise AI customers unprecedented control and customization. AWS re:Invent 2025 Declares the Age of the AI Agent The opening keynote from AWS CEO Matt Garman set the tone, asserting that AI agents represent the “true value” of artificial intelligence investments. “AI assistants are starting to give way to AI agents that can perform tasks and automate on your behalf,” Garman stated. This wasn’t just theoretical; the conference was packed with product announcements designed to make this a reality. Swami Sivasubramanian, VP of Agentic AI at AWS, captured the bullish sentiment: “Agents give you the freedom to build without limits, accelerating how quickly you can go from idea to impact.” The core promise of AWS re:Invent 2025 was to provide the tools that turn this promise into a daily operational reality for businesses worldwide. Frontier Agents: Your New Autonomous Teammates AWS introduced three groundbreaking “Frontier agents,” designed to operate with significant autonomy. The standout is the Kiro autonomous agent, a coding assistant that learns a team’s patterns and can then work independently for hours or even days. This moves far beyond code completion into the realm of a persistent, learning software engineer. The other agents target critical enterprise functions: Security Agent: Automates code reviews and security audits. DevOps Agent: Manages deployments and works to prevent incidents when pushing new code live. These agents are available in preview, marking a concrete step toward the agentic future AWS is championing. Supercharging Enterprise AI with New Chips and Systems Underpinning these advanced AI capabilities is a new generation of hardware. AWS made significant announcements on the AI chips front, crucial for anyone building compute-intensive applications like AI model training or blockchain validation. Chip/System Key Feature Performance Claim Graviton5 CPU 192 processor cores, reduced inter-core latency Highest performance and efficiency yet for general compute Trainium3 AI Chip Next-gen training & inference chip 4x performance gain, 40% lower energy use UltraServer AI System Runs Trainium3 chips Designed for massive-scale AI workloads AI Factory On-premises AWS AI system (with Nvidia/ Trainium3) Addresses data sovereignty for governments & corporations A critical teaser was that the already-in-development Trainium4 will feature compatibility with Nvidia’s chips, a strategic move acknowledging the heterogeneous reality of modern enterprise AI infrastructure. Building Smarter: Tools for Custom LLMs and Agent Control For enterprises wanting to build their own intelligence, AWS unveiled major upgrades to its developer platforms. The goal is to simplify the creation of custom LLMs and governable agents. Amazon SageMaker AI: Now includes serverless model customization, allowing developers to start building without managing underlying infrastructure. Amazon Bedrock: Introduced Reinforcement Fine Tuning, offering preset workflows to automate the customization process from start to finish. AgentCore Platform: Enhanced with “Policy” features for setting agent boundaries, memory capabilities for user context, and 13 prebuilt evaluation systems. These tools lower the barrier to entry for creating specialized, secure, and effective AI solutions tailored to unique business data and processes. The Human Element: Werner Vogels’ Final Bow and the Job Question In an emotional closing keynote, Amazon CTO Dr. Werner Vogels announced this would be his final re:Invent presentation after 14 years. He directly addressed the elephant in the room: “Will AI take my job? Maybe… We should rephrase… Will AI make me obsolete? Absolutely not, if you evolve.” His message was one of empowerment, urging developers to see AI as a tool for augmentation rather than replacement. This human-centric perspective was a vital counterbalance to the wave of automation news, emphasizing that the future belongs to those who learn to collaborate with these new AI agents . Real Impact and Cost Savings The conference wasn’t just about future promises. Customer stories and immediate cost-saving measures highlighted present-day value: Lyft reported using an AI agent built with Anthropic’s Claude on Bedrock to handle driver/rider issues, cutting average resolution time by 87% and increasing driver usage by 70%. AWS launched Database Savings Plans , offering up to 35% cost reduction for committed database usage, a move hailed by cloud economists after years of customer requests. Amazon is offering a year of free credits for its Kiro coding agent to eligible early-stage startups, aiming to win developer mindshare. Conclusion: A Foundation for the Next Decade of Innovation AWS re:Invent 2025 was a definitive pivot from talking about AI to building the operational framework for it. By focusing on autonomous agents, powerful and efficient AI chips , and tools for creating custom LLMs , AWS is providing the building blocks for the next wave of enterprise AI applications. For the tech and crypto ecosystems, these advancements mean more accessible, powerful, and sovereign compute resources. The ability to run AI factories on-premises and train models on proprietary data securely opens new doors for innovation in fintech, DeFi, and beyond.

Tom Lee of BitMine said on TV that Bitcoin gained nearly 20% in the weeks following the last time the Fed shifted away from QT. He noted that the same setup might lead to more upside before the year ends. Many traders are watching how much money returns to markets because it can shape short-term sentiment. ETF Flows And Long-Term Views According to reports, new XRP ETFs have already attracted more than $800 million in inflows. Supporters say these inflows can change how investors view XRP, although they don’t remove all uncertainty. Some hedge fund managers also weighed in, pointing out that over the past 16 years the Fed added close to $9 trillion in liquidity while only removing $3.2 trillion before reversing course. Utility Tokens May Get More Attention Some community voices argue that tokens built for payments or settlement may see stronger demand if liquidity continues to rise. One XRP supporter said XRP was made to move money at scale and claimed the market will focus more on assets with real use cases. Adoption remains mixed. Some companies that previously used Ripple’s tools have stepped back, while others still rely on parts of its payment network. The XRP Ledger is being used, but not always in the same way it was during earlier partnerships.

55371755,639985,1764900020,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/55371755.jpeg,"Bitcoin Enters New Adoption Phase: Vanguard, Schwab, and Japan Fuel BTC Recovery",https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-enters-adoption-phase-vanguard-schwab-japan/,"Bitcoin has climbed back above $93,000 after enduring days of intense selling pressure, heightened volatility, and widespread market uncertainty. The recovery marks a significant shift in sentiment, but according to a new report from CryptoQuant, one signal stands out as the primary driver behind the rebound: institutional capital is quietly flowing back into the market. The analysis highlights a key metric— the Coinbase Premium Index, long regarded as a reliable proxy for US institutional demand. Throughout November’s steep correction, the premium plunged deep into negative territory, revealing a stark imbalance: US spot buyers were far weaker than their offshore counterparts. During this phase, as Bitcoin slid below $90,000, the sharp drop in the premium reflected clear risk-off positioning among US-regulated investors, many of whom stepped back or took profits amid rising macro uncertainty. Now, with Bitcoin recovering key levels, the data shows early signs of renewed accumulation from US-based institutions. This subtle but meaningful shift suggests that the most conservative segment of the market—professional and regulated capital —may be positioning again after the correction. If this trend continues, the rebound above $93K could evolve into a much broader shift in market structure. Institutional Catalysts Drive Bitcoin Coinbase Premium Higher According to the CryptoQuant report , the narrative has shifted decisively. The Coinbase Premium Index has climbed back into positive territory, signaling renewed accumulation from US-based institutional and regulated investors. This shift coincides with a wave of major developments reshaping the global investment landscape. Most notably, Charles Schwab, a $12 trillion asset manager, announced plans to offer Bitcoin and Ethereum trading in early 2026. This follows Vanguard’s market-moving reversal that opened access to spot crypto ETFs for more than 50 million conservative investors. These firms are not speculative players—they are the backbone of American retirement wealth. At the same time, a powerful but less publicized catalyst is emerging overseas: Japan is moving toward formal approval of Bitcoin ETFs. Given the size of Japanese investment trusts, pension-linked products, and retail participation, early adoption could inject $3–10 billion of fresh demand. While no single region drives Bitcoin’s valuation alone, combined flows from the US, Europe, and Japan could easily deliver a mid-single-digit percentage uplift to BTC in the early phases of this expansion. The broader takeaway is unmistakable: Bitcoin is transitioning from a niche risk asset into a globally standardized investment product. The return of a positive Coinbase Premium may be the market’s earliest confirmation that institutions—especially the most conservative ones—are positioning ahead of 2026. Weekly Structure Shows Early Signs of Recovery Bitcoin’s weekly chart shows a decisive rebound, with price pushing back above $93,000 after weeks of aggressive selling pressure. The recent wick down toward the green 100-week moving average (100W MA) marked a key moment: buyers stepped in precisely at long-term dynamic support, preventing a deeper breakdown toward the $80,000–$82,000 region. This reaction confirms that long-term holders and institutional buyers are protecting this level, aligning with the recent return of positive signals from the Coinbase Premium Index. Despite the rebound, the chart still shows Bitcoin facing overhead resistance. The 50-week MA sits just above the price, creating a supply zone between $97,000 and $102,000. This has historically acted as a trend-determining range; reclaiming it would shift momentum decisively back to the bulls. Until then, the market remains in a mid-cycle consolidation. Volume behavior also supports the recovery narrative. The huge sell-volume spikes seen in November marked capitulation-like behavior, which often precedes trend reversals. The recent green weekly candle forming on rising buy volume suggests that demand is returning, aligning with improving liquidity conditions on major US and global exchanges.

It marks a major step forward in cross-chain interoperability between Base and Solana. With the bridge in place, users can enjoy seamless, bidirectional asset transfers from Solana to Base , and vice versa, without needing to rely on centralized exchanges or third-party intermediaries. What’s the Base—Solana bridge? According to Base’s official X page , the Base-Solana bridge, which makes it easy for anyone to move assets across both ecosystems, is secured by Chainlink’s Cross-Chain Interoperability Protocol (CCIP), via a bespoke cross-chain oracle, alongside Coinbase. Coinbase and Chainlink CCIP are node operators, each independently verifying all messages in a bid to ensure all token transfers between Base and Solana are safe and reliable. The rollout is happening on multiple apps, including Zora, AerodromeFi, Virtuals, Flaunch, and RelayProtocol, and is available for anyone to use. Users will also be able to trade and use Solana assets on Base natively, and this covers not only standard tokens like $SOL, but also memecoins like $CHILLHOUSE, $TRENCHER, and many more. The move is ultimately designed to unlock unified liquidity pools across both ecosystems, allowing users to trade, deploy, and interact with assets from either chain in a single environment. Base’s official announcement aligns with its core vision of being a “bridge rather than island” and an “everything economy,” where “every asset, across every network, [is] available at any time.” On the other side of the bridge, the Solana network has become the first chain to get connected via this infrastructure, though there are plans in the pipeline for expansions to other networks like Avalanche and Polygon. “By leveraging Chainlink CCIP as the cross-chain infrastructure securing the Base-Solana Bridge, Base enables developers to build the most secure cross-chain applications and move the industry toward a reliable interoperability standard that is adopted by the largest financial institutions in the world,” said Johann Eid, Chief Business Officer at Chainlink Labs. “This is how onchain finance scales to securely support global markets and the hundreds of trillions in value they represent.” Base chain facilitated JPMorgan bridge with DeFi Given its lofty goal of being the “everything economy,” the recent moves have been on brand for Base. It just announced the bridge between Solana and Base, but weeks before that, it played a big role in helping JPMorgan Chase & Co. begin the rollout of its JPM Coin deposit token . The token , which enables institutional clients to settle transactions instantly and 24/7, marks a major expansion of traditional banking into public blockchain infrastructure and is based on the Base network. The token named the JPM Coin represents dollar deposits held at the bank, allowing clients to send and receive funds on Base. Unlike traditional stablecoins, JPM Coin can pay holders interest, which makes it an attractive alternative for institutions, including crypto trading firms that use stablecoins for collateral or liquidity management. By hosting both the JPM Coin and DeFi-native services, Base has the combo of supporting regulated banking tokens and permissionless financial applications, a synergy that creates a unified infrastructure under which TradFi and DeFi can coexist. The alignment also shows that more banks are increasingly experimenting with blockchain to facilitate faster, cheaper, and more accessible payments beyond traditional business hours.

In a recent announcement, the world’s leading cryptocurrency exchange took decisive action. Binance suspends deposits and withdrawals for these three specific tokens, citing network delays as the primary reason. This temporary measure, effective from 8:00 a.m. UTC on December 12, is a reminder of the technical realities behind the seamless crypto trading experience. Let’s break down what this means for your assets and why such pauses are sometimes necessary. Why Did Binance Suspend These Transactions? Binance’s decision is a proactive step, not a reactive panic. The official reason given is network delays . But what does that actually mean for you as a user? Essentially, the underlying blockchain networks for CHESS, DF, and GHST are experiencing congestion or technical slowdowns. When this happens, transactions can become stuck, take excessively long times to confirm, or even fail entirely. Therefore, by temporarily suspending the deposit and withdrawal functions, Binance protects its users from potential loss of funds. Imagine sending tokens to the exchange only for the transaction to get lost in a delayed network—you’d be left in limbo. This pause allows the network issues to be resolved, ensuring that when services resume, all movements are safe, secure, and verifiable on their respective blockchains. Which Tokens Are Affected and What Should You Do? The suspension specifically targets three assets: CHESS (the token for the Tranchess protocol), DF (dForce), and GHST (Aavegotchi). If you hold these tokens on Binance, here is what you need to know: Trading is Unaffected: You can still buy, sell, and trade these tokens against other pairs on Binance’s spot market. The suspension only applies to moving tokens on or off the exchange. Your Funds Are Safe: All existing balances of CHESS, DF, and GHST in your Binance wallets remain secure and under your control. No Action Required: For most users, no immediate action is needed. Simply wait for Binance to announce the resumption of services, which typically happens once network stability is confirmed. This is a standard operational procedure for reputable exchanges. It highlights their commitment to security over convenience, a trade-off that seasoned crypto users have come to appreciate. Understanding Network Delays in Cryptocurrency You might wonder, why do these network delays happen? Blockchain networks are not infallible. They can experience high traffic, similar to a website crashing during a sale. Sometimes, upgrades or unexpected bugs can also cause slowdowns. When an exchange like Binance detects irregular activity or confirmation times on a network, the safest course is to halt movements until the all-clear is given. This incident serves as a useful case study. It shows that even popular tokens and large exchanges are subject to the fundamental technical layers of crypto. It’s a built-in challenge of a decentralized ecosystem. However, transparent communication from the exchange, as seen here, helps manage user expectations and maintain trust. What Happens Next After Binance Suspends Deposits? The key word from Binance is “temporary.” The exchange has a track record of quickly resolving such issues. Users should monitor the official Binance Announcements channel for the service resumption notice. Typically, the process is: Binance engineers monitor the affected networks. Once network performance returns to normal and remains stable, they will conduct tests. An official announcement will be made, and deposit/withdrawal services will be re-enabled. There is no need for alarm. This is a routine operational pause designed to protect your assets. In the long run, such measures contribute to a more reliable and secure trading environment for everyone. Conclusion: A Pause for Protection, Not for Panic When Binance suspends deposits and withdrawals for specific tokens, it is exercising necessary caution. The move regarding CHESS, DF, and GHST is a textbook example of an exchange prioritizing user asset safety amidst external network instability. While momentarily inconvenient, it prevents the far greater hassle of lost or stuck transactions. It underscores the importance of choosing platforms with robust risk management protocols. As the crypto space evolves, such transparent and security-focused actions are what build enduring user confidence. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: Can I still trade CHESS, DF, and GHST on Binance? A: Yes. The suspension only affects depositing tokens into your Binance wallet and withdrawing them out. Spot trading for these tokens continues as normal. Q2: How long will the suspension last? A: Binance has not provided a specific timeline. The service will be restored once the underlying network delays are resolved and stability is confirmed. Users should check the official announcements for updates. Q3: Are my tokens safe on Binance during this time? A: Absolutely. Your existing token balances are secure in your wallet. The suspension is a preventive measure to protect funds in transit, not a security breach. Q4: What causes network delays for cryptocurrencies? A: Network delays can be caused by high transaction volume congesting the blockchain, ongoing network upgrades, or unexpected technical issues with the node infrastructure. Q5: Will this affect the price of CHESS, DF, or GHST? A: While temporary suspension of transfers can sometimes cause short-term price volatility due to reduced liquidity flow, the core trading markets remain open. The long-term price impact is typically minimal for such routine operational pauses. Q6: Has this happened before with Binance? A: Yes. It is a standard industry practice. Exchanges like Binance periodically suspend deposits and withdrawals for various tokens to perform wallet maintenance, support network upgrades, or address network instability, always with user safety in mind.

This pivotal listing, effective from 8:00 a.m. UTC today, dramatically increases SAPIEN’s accessibility and liquidity for a massive regional audience. For traders and project watchers, this is a development that demands attention. Why Does Bithumb Listing SAPIEN Matter? When a major exchange like Bithumb lists a new asset, it’s never just a routine update. It’s a powerful endorsement that can shape market trajectories. This decision signals that SAPIEN has passed rigorous due diligence, meeting the exchange’s standards for security and potential. For the project, it unlocks direct access to one of the world’s most active and retail-investor-driven crypto economies. Therefore, the immediate benefit is enhanced liquidity and easier onboarding for Korean investors. They can now purchase SAPIEN directly with their local currency, bypassing the complexity and fees of cross-exchange transfers. This seamless access is a cornerstone for fostering genuine adoption. What Challenges Could SAPIEN Face on Bithumb? However, listing is just the beginning. The real test is performance in a highly competitive environment. Bithumb’s user base is savvy and responsive, meaning SAPIEN will be under intense scrutiny from day one. The token must demonstrate clear utility and sustained trading volume to maintain visibility and avoid being lost among hundreds of other pairs. Moreover, the project team must now engage proactively with a new community. Effective communication regarding roadmap milestones and unique value propositions will be crucial to converting curious traders into long-term holders. Navigating the regulatory expectations of the South Korean market is another ongoing consideration. Actionable Insights for Crypto Enthusiasts For those watching this space, here are key points to consider: Monitor Initial Volume: The first 24-48 hours of trading will provide critical clues about initial demand and market sentiment toward SAPIEN on this new platform. Understand the Pair: Trading against KRW (SAPIEN/KRW) means price action will be influenced specifically by Korean market dynamics, which can sometimes diverge from global BTC or USD pairs. Review Project Fundamentals: Use this event as a catalyst to revisit SAPIEN’s whitepaper, use cases, and recent developments. A listing amplifies exposure, but fundamentals drive long-term value. The Bigger Picture for South Korea’s Crypto Scene Bithumb’s move to list SAPIEN is more than a single asset addition; it reflects the exchange’s strategy to diversify its offerings and capture interest in emerging Web3 and AI-adjacent tokens. It reinforces South Korea’s position as a critical hub where retail adoption can make or break a project’s early momentum. This listing could pave the way for similar tokens seeking a foothold in Asia. In conclusion, Bithumb listing SAPIEN is a transformative event that bridges a promising digital asset with a powerhouse market. It offers unparalleled opportunity for the project while presenting a new, high-potential asset for Korean traders. Success will hinge on sustained utility, community engagement, and navigating the vibrant yet demanding Korean crypto ecosystem. This is a chapter worth watching closely.

A clear Inverse Head & Shoulders formation, combined with rising accumulation and weakening trend rejection, suggests that the market may be gearing up for a powerful upside move. With momentum tightening and key levels coming into focus, ETH now stands on the verge of a breakout that could set the stage for its next major rally. Inverse Head And Shoulders Signals Brewing Momentum According to a recent update shared by crypto analyst Donald Dean, Ethereum may be gearing up for a significant move. He highlighted the development of a potential inverse head and shoulders pattern, a classic bullish reversal formation that often precedes strong upward momentum. This emerging structure suggests that ETH could soon shift into a more aggressive bullish phase if confirmed. Related Reading: Ethereum Rockets Higher, Narrowing Distance to a Make-or-Break Resistance Line Dean also pointed out that the weekly chart is showing solid support near the 50% Fibonacci retracement level, positioned around $2,750. Adding to the bullish signals, a hammer candle has appeared on the weekly timeframe, hinting at buying pressure stepping back in after recent downside movement. If the pattern plays out, Dean noted that Ethereum’s first major target lies at $4,109, a level that would allow ETH to challenge previous resistance/support zones. Reclaiming this region would mark a meaningful shift in momentum and strengthen the bullish outlook for the asset. Beyond that, the next upside target sits near $5,766, which aligns closely with the 1.618 Golden Ratio extension calculated at approximately $5,793.51. Dean described this confluence as particularly noteworthy, suggesting that if Ethereum breaks above its nearer targets, a larger rally toward this golden-ratio level becomes a realistic possibility. Growing Accumulation Suggests Bulls Are Preparing For Action In an earlier analysis, LSTRADER reminded followers of the impressive move from $1,600 to $4,800, noting that this surge had been identified in advance through both the ETH chart and the ETH/BTC setup. The analysis captured the momentum shift that preceded the rally, reinforcing the value of tracking key structural signals. Related Reading: Ethereum Open Interest Cut In Half As $6.4B In Positions Vanish: Market Reset Accelerates In the current market structure, LSTRADER noted that the chart clearly shows multiple instances where the trend faced rejection. Despite these rejections, the trend is steadily losing strength while accumulation continues to build, a combination that typically reflects growing bullish interest and the potential for an upward breakout. However, LSTRADER stressed that no major move should be assumed until the trendline itself is broken, and confirmation is still required. For now, patience is key as traders continue monitoring the structure and waiting for a decisive shift in trend direction.

55373364,639988,1764903627,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/55373364.jpeg,Ripple CEO Predicts 2026 Will Be A Breakout Year For Crypto,https://bitcoinist.com/ripple-ceo-2026-breakout-year-for-crypto/,"At Binance Blockchain Week on December 3, Ripple Labs CEO Brad Garlinghouse argued that a rare alignment of regulatory change, institutional demand and real-world utility is setting up crypto for what he called powerful “macro tailwinds” heading into 2026. “I personally will echo some of the things Richard said: there are so many macro factors that are continuing to provide tailwinds for this industry that I think as we go into 2026 I don’t remember being this optimistic in the last handful of years,” the Ripple CEO told CNBC’s Dan Murphy, speaking alongside Binance CEO Richard Teng and Solana Foundation President Lily Liu. Ripple CEO Is Optimistic For 2026: Here’s Why He framed the latest drawdown not as the start of a structural bear market but as a risk-off interlude against a fundamentally improved backdrop. “Crypto has gone through cycles and when you have risk-on people are excited now you have kind of a risk-off moment, there’s uncertainty,” he said. The difference this time, he argued, is that the United States—the largest single economy and roughly “22% of global GDP”—is finally moving away from what he described as years of open hostility toward the sector. “This is a market that has been really openly hostile to crypto for four or five years or maybe longer, and now you have that that has changed significantly, pretty quickly,” he said. Institutions, in his view, are only beginning to adjust. He pointed to the visible presence of traditional asset managers at the event: “You saw Franklin Templeton on stage here, you saw BlackRock on stage just this week. I think Vanguard has now opened up […] Vanguard historically has said ‘we won’t touch crypto’ and now they’ve had a massive sea change.” On crypto ETFs, the Ripple CEO rejected the idea that the trade was over-hyped. “Definitely no,” he said when asked whether the ETF “floor” narrative had been exaggerated. He stressed how new these vehicles still are in the United States and highlighted early demand for XRP products. “In the last two or three weeks over $700 million have flowed into XRP ETFs , which is just pent-up demand from institutional investors, from investors who want access because they don’t want to custody themselves,” he said. He argued that the key metric is crypto’s still-small slice of the overall ETF universe. “The total ETF market—only one or two percent of the total ETF market is crypto. I will bet anybody here that a year from now that will be more than one or two percent,” he said. Short-term outflows from Bitcoin products, he suggested, should be viewed in context: “Over 2026 do we really think crypto ETFs are only going to be one or two percent of the total ETF market? No chance.” Garlinghouse said Ripple’s own prime brokerage business is already seeing that shift in behavior. Institutions that had remained “on the sidelines” due to regulatory uncertainty or risk aversion are now “getting involved and they’re starting small, and they’re going to walk, then they’re going to crawl—or crawl then walk then run.” Asked directly whether recent volatility had deterred institutional capital, he replied: “Definitely not.” Stablecoins Will Be A Key Pillar Stablecoins were another pillar of his 2026 thesis. He agreed that in the latest risk-off phase, capital largely rotated into stablecoins rather than exiting on-chain rails, which he said reflects both utility and trust. “People are recognizing stablecoins can be stable and easier to manage,” he said. Garlinghouse highlighted that Ripple’s own stablecoin, launched “just over a year ago,” has “just passed about a billion market cap,” is “approved and whitelisted in Abu Dhabi ,” and is being used as “good collateral on various platforms from a lending point of view.” For him, stablecoins are an entry ramp to broader adoption, alongside other applications that will be built across Solana, Binance and Ripple ecosystems. On US policy, he said the trajectory has clearly improved, especially for payment tokens. He cited the GENIUS Act as “regulatory clarity for stablecoins” and linked it to growing corporate interest in on-chain payments. After Ripple’s acquisition of GTreasury , which has visibility into “over 10 trillion dollars of payments,” he said “the number of those customers that are already approaching us interested in leveraging stablecoins […] because of that clarity, people are leaning in.” The Ripple CEO noted that XRP has already received a form of clarity from US federal courts but said broader legislation is still needed. He referenced the “Clarity Act” for crypto, saying there is “still forward momentum” and predicting that “sometime in the first half of next year we’ll see passage of legislation, which will continue to unlock and create more tailwinds for the whole industry.” He closed with an explicit price target for the next cycle, acknowledging he was “going out on a limb”: “I’ll say Bitcoin $180,000 December 23rd—or December 31st—2026.” At press time, XRP traded at $2.15.",XRP|Brad Garlinghouse|ripple|ripple news|XRP news|XRP price,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|MARKET|XRP|BNB|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-12-05 03:00:27

The CLARITY Act is meant to clearly divide oversight between the SEC and CFTC, expanding the CFTC’s role in digital commodity markets. The SEC’s reversal of SAB 121 removes capital barriers for banks to offer crypto custody, boosting institutional participation. Blockchain security company CertiK has released a U.S. Digital Asset Policy Report examining the impact of the legislative milestones in the United States. The current federal framework emerged from the GENIUS Act, the CLARITY Act, which was passed in the U.S. House of Representatives and is still being reviewed in the Senate, and the rescission of Staff Accounting Bulletin 121. The Certik highlighted that these new federal laws and market-structure reforms have ushered in the clearest framework yet for stablecoin issuance, asset classification, and institutional custody. According to CertiK, they aim to provide “financial institutions, digital asset providers, and policymakers evaluating how federal and state rules intersect” with an authoritative resource with the report. “This report reveals a pivotal shift in how digital assets are regulated and supervised across the United States,” said Kayvon Hosseini, CertiK’s head of advisory. “By analyzing federal legislation and market structure proposals, as well as state-level obligations, the research highlights the operational demands that digital asset firms must meet in the coming years.” Federal rules set clear standards for stablecoins and custody The GENIUS Act, signed into law in July this year, establishes for the first time a federal licensing framework for payment-stablecoin issuers, sets strict reserve-asset and redemption rules, and prohibits the issuance of dollar-backed tokens without federal approval. The law was widely described as a landmark industry moment in U.S. digital-asset legislation and was welcomed by crypto companies, banks and fintechs preparing to enter the stablecoin market. The CLARITY Act, meanwhile, advances the longstanding debate over how to classify digital tokens by delineating the boundary between securities and digital commodities. The proposal, backed by Senate Republicans, would clearly define the Commodity Futures Trading Commission’s (CFTC) and the SEC’s oversight. It is said to also expand the CFTC’s oversight of digital commodity markets, reserving securities-linked products for the SEC. The report also looked into the impact of the SEC rescinding SAB 121, highlighting that the reversal “removes prior capital constraints on digital asset custodians, enabling broader bank participation.” Another finding in the report is that despite a universal baseline for cybersecurity and AML compliance existing at the federal level, fragmented state licensing regimes continue, creating “a preemption gap for multi-state operators.” Meanwhile, market-structure legislation in the Senate is paving the way for CFTC-registered exchanges to list spot crypto products, a move that could reshape trading venues for assets categorized as commodities under the CLARITY framework. CFTC Acting Chairman Caroline D. Pham earlier today announced that listed spot cryptocurrency products will begin trading for the first time in U.S. federally regulated markets on CFTC-registered futures exchanges as of December 4 Another key finding in the report is institutional pilots, such as the Regulated Liability Network and Project Guardian, which are said to demonstrate accelerating adoption of permissioned settlement infrastructure. Regulatory clarity enters the space globally Beyond the U.S., the CertiK report situates these developments within a global trend with jurisdictions around the world fast-tracking the rollout of stablecoin and digital-asset regulations. According to TRM Labs’ 2025/26 global policy review , which pointed out that “stablecoins were a huge focus for policymakers worldwide, with over 70% of jurisdictions progressing stablecoin regulation in 2025.” CertiK stated, “For financial institutions, the strategic focus is shifting toward permissioned digital assets: using blockchain-based settlement within clearly defined regulatory perimeters. As liquidity becomes segmented by jurisdiction (for example, between U.S. and EU/MiCA-compliant pools), the ability to map regulatory ‘gaps’ and build compliant, cross-jurisdictional infrastructure will be a key source of competitive advantage over the next few years.”",Industry Thoughts,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|MARKET|REGULATION|TRADING|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-12-05 03:04:43

ETH is now consolidating gains and might aim for more gains above $3,250. Ethereum started a fresh increase above the $3,050 and $3,120 levels. The price is trading above $3,120 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. There is a short-term contracting triangle forming with support at $3,130 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD (data feed via Kraken). The pair could continue to move up if it settles above the $3,240 zone. Ethereum Price Eyes Another Upside Break Ethereum price managed to stay above $2,920 and started a fresh increase, like Bitcoin . ETH price gained strength for a move above the $3,000 and $3,050 resistance levels. The bulls even pumped the price above $3,150. However, the bulls struggled to clear $3,240 and $3,250. A high was formed at $3,239 and the price recently corrected some gains. There was a spike below the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the recent move from the $2,718 swing low to the $3,239 low. Ethereum price is now trading above $3,120 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average . There is also a short-term contracting triangle forming with support at $3,130 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD. If there is another upward move, the price could face resistance near the $3,200 level. The next key resistance is near the $3,240 level. The first major resistance is near the $3,250 level. A clear move above the $3,250 resistance might send the price toward the $3,320 resistance. An upside break above the $3,320 region might call for more gains in the coming days. In the stated case, Ether could rise toward the $3,450 resistance zone or even $3,500 in the near term. Downside Correction In ETH? If Ethereum fails to clear the $3,240 resistance, it could start a fresh decline. Initial support on the downside is near the $3,120 level. The first major support sits near the $3,050 zone. A clear move below the $3,050 support might push the price toward the $3,000 support. Any more losses might send the price toward the $2,980 region and the 50% Fib retracement level of the recent move from the $2,718 swing low to the $3,239 low in the near term. The next key support sits at $2,850 and $2,840. Technical Indicators Hourly MACD – The MACD for ETH/USD is gaining momentum in the bullish zone.

55373733,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=231118,1764904212,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Crypto Liquidations: The Staggering $187M Wipeout That Crushed Long Positions,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/crypto-liquidations-long-positions-loss/,"BitcoinWorld Crypto Liquidations: The Staggering $187M Wipeout That Crushed Long Positions The cryptocurrency market just witnessed a brutal 24-hour period where over $187 million in positions were forcibly closed. This wave of crypto liquidations disproportionately hammered traders betting on higher prices, offering a stark reminder of the market’s inherent volatility. Let’s break down what happened and what it means for you. What Caused This Massive Wave of Crypto Liquidations? When traders use leverage in perpetual futures markets, they must maintain a minimum margin. If the market moves against their position and their collateral value falls below this level, exchanges automatically close, or ‘liquidate,’ their trade to prevent further loss. The recent crypto liquidations event, totaling $187 million, was triggered by a sharp price decline that breached critical support levels for many leveraged traders. A Breakdown of the $187M Liquidation Carnage The data reveals a clear and painful trend: the majority of losses came from long positions. Here is the detailed breakdown: Bitcoin (BTC): $90.06 million liquidated. A significant 67.33% of this came from long positions. Ethereum (ETH): $87.9 million liquidated, with 63.5% being longs. Solana (SOL): $9.37 million liquidated. An overwhelming 87.52% were long positions caught in the downdraft. This pattern shows that bullish sentiment was overly crowded, leaving many traders exposed when the market turned. Why Were Long Positions Hit So Hard? The dominance of long position crypto liquidations points to a classic market scenario. Before the drop, optimism likely prevailed, encouraging traders to take leveraged long bets. However, when prices fell rapidly, these highly leveraged longs became the most vulnerable. Their forced selling then added more downward pressure, creating a cascade effect that amplified the initial move. This is a key mechanism behind market volatility spikes. How Can Traders Navigate Future Liquidation Risks? While crypto liquidations are a market reality, you can manage your risk. First, always use stop-loss orders to define your exit point before you enter a trade. Second, employ sensible leverage; higher leverage magnifies both gains and losses. Third, never invest more than you can afford to lose, especially with margin trading. Finally, stay informed about market sentiment and technical levels to avoid getting caught in crowded trades. The Bigger Picture: What Do These Liquidations Signal? Large-scale crypto liquidations often act as a reset button, flushing out excessive leverage from the system. While painful for those affected, this can lead to a healthier market foundation with less speculative froth. It serves as a powerful lesson on the importance of risk management over blind speculation. The market’s recovery will depend on broader factors, but the removal of weak leveraged positions can sometimes pave the way for more sustainable moves. In summary, the recent $187 million liquidation event was a forceful demonstration of crypto market risk. Long positions bore the brunt of the damage across major assets like Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Solana. This episode underscores a non-negotiable rule for survival: robust risk management is not optional. By understanding the forces behind these crypto liquidations , you can trade with more awareness and better protect your capital from future storms. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) What are crypto liquidations? Crypto liquidations occur when an exchange forcibly closes a trader’s leveraged position because they can no longer meet the margin requirements, usually due to the market moving against them. Why were mostly long positions liquidated? This indicates that before the price drop, there was a high concentration of traders using leverage to bet on prices going up (longs). The sudden downturn hit these crowded positions hardest. Do large liquidations mean the market will crash further? Not necessarily. While liquidations can cause short-term selling pressure, they also remove weak leverage from the market, which can sometimes stabilize prices and allow for a rebound. How can I avoid getting liquidated? Use lower leverage, set strategic stop-loss orders, maintain adequate margin collateral above minimum requirements, and avoid overexposing your portfolio to a single trade. Is trading perpetual futures riskier than spot trading? Yes, significantly. Perpetual futures involve leverage, which amplifies potential gains and losses, making you susceptible to liquidation. Spot trading, where you own the asset outright, does not carry this specific risk. Where can I track liquidation data? Several analytics websites like Coinglass provide real-time data on crypto liquidations across exchanges, helping you gauge market leverage and sentiment.

Starting December 9th, you cannot deposit or withdraw POL. This Bithumb POL suspension supports a vital network upgrade. But what does this mean for your assets, and how should you prepare? Let’s break it down. Why is Bithumb Suspending POL Transactions? Bithumb is proactively supporting a scheduled upgrade to the Polygon network. The Bithumb POL suspension of deposits and withdrawals is a standard security measure. Exchanges often pause services during such events to ensure a smooth transition and protect user funds. The suspension begins precisely at 2:00 a.m. UTC on December 9th. Therefore, all POL movement on Bithumb will be frozen at that time. What Does This Mean for Your POL Tokens? First, don’t panic. Your POL tokens held on Bithumb are safe. The suspension only affects moving them on or off the exchange. You can still trade POL against other pairs on Bithumb’s spot market during this period.

In a move that impacts traders and investors, Binance, the world’s leading cryptocurrency exchange, has announced a temporary suspension of deposits and withdrawals for LUNA. This planned pause is a critical step to facilitate a seamless network upgrade. If you use Binance for your LUNA transactions, here’s everything you need to know to navigate this brief hiatus confidently. Why is Binance Suspending LUNA Services? Binance will temporarily suspend deposits and withdrawals for the LUNA token starting at 12:05 p.m. UTC on December 8. The primary reason for this Binance LUNA suspension is to provide technical support for an upcoming network upgrade on the Terra blockchain. Exchanges often implement these precautionary halts to ensure the safety of user funds during significant protocol changes. Therefore, this is a standard operational procedure, not a cause for alarm. What Does This Binance LUNA Suspension Mean for You? Understanding the scope of this suspension is crucial for planning your crypto activities. Here’s a clear breakdown of what will and won’t be affected: Deposits & Withdrawals (PAUSED): You will not be able to send LUNA to your Binance wallet or withdraw it to an external wallet during the suspension window. Trading (UNAFFECTED): Crucially, spot and futures trading for LUNA trading pairs on Binance will continue as normal. You can still buy, sell, and trade your LUNA tokens on the exchange. Existing Funds (SAFE): All LUNA tokens already held in your Binance wallet remain secure and unaffected. This targeted approach minimizes disruption, allowing market activity to continue while the technical upgrade proceeds safely in the background. How to Prepare for the Temporary Binance LUNA Halt A little preparation can prevent last-minute stress. Follow these simple steps before the suspension takes effect: Complete Pending Transactions: Finalize any urgent LUNA deposits or withdrawals well before the 12:05 p.m. UTC deadline on December 8. Monitor Official Channels: Follow Binance’s official announcements for the exact time when services will resume. Upgrades can sometimes conclude earlier or later than initially planned. Consider Trading Plans: Since trading continues, decide if you need to adjust any short-term strategies around the suspension period. What Are the Benefits of This Network Upgrade? While a temporary Binance LUNA suspension is an inconvenience, the underlying network upgrade it supports is ultimately positive. These upgrades often aim to: Enhance network security and stability. Improve transaction speed or reduce costs. Introduce new features or functionality to the Terra ecosystem. Supporting these improvements helps ensure the long-term health and scalability of the LUNA network, benefiting all token holders in the future. Conclusion: A Brief Pause for Long-Term Gain The temporary Binance LUNA suspension for deposits and withdrawals is a standard, proactive measure by a major exchange. Its purpose is to ensure a smooth and secure network transition for the Terra blockchain. By understanding what the halt entails—affecting only transfers, not trading—you can manage your assets without worry. Keep an eye on Binance’s official communication for the resumption notice, and remember that such upgrades are foundational steps toward a more robust crypto ecosystem. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) 1. Can I still trade LUNA on Binance during the suspension? Yes. The suspension applies only to deposits and withdrawals. All spot and futures trading for LUNA will continue without interruption. 2. How long will the Binance LUNA suspension last? Binance has not specified an end time. The suspension begins on December 8 at 12:05 p.m. UTC and will last until the network upgrade is complete and deemed stable. Users should monitor Binance’s official announcements for the resumption notice. 3. Are my LUNA tokens safe on Binance during this time? Absolutely. The suspension is a preventive technical measure. All LUNA funds held in your Binance wallet remain secure and unaffected. 4. What happens if I try to deposit LUNA after the suspension starts? Deposits initiated after 12:05 p.m. UTC on December 8 will not be processed and may be lost. It is critical to complete all transfers before the deadline. 5. Will other exchanges also suspend LUNA services? Possibly. Other exchanges that support the Terra network may announce similar suspensions to facilitate the same upgrade. Always check the announcements from your specific exchange. 6. What should I do if I have an urgent need to move my LUNA?

This single transaction, valued at approximately $283 million, represents one of the largest stablecoin movements recently observed on-chain. Such a colossal USDT transfer immediately raises critical questions about market sentiment, potential institutional maneuvering, and the underlying stability of the crypto ecosystem. Let’s dive into what this massive movement could mean. What Does This Massive USDT Transfer Actually Mean? When a sum this large moves off a centralized exchange like OKX, it typically signals one of a few scenarios. The recipient ‘unknown wallet’ is a private, non-custodial address, meaning the entity controlling it has taken full, direct custody of their assets. This action alone is a powerful statement. It could indicate a major investor, often called a ‘whale,’ is moving funds for safekeeping, preparing for a large over-the-counter (OTC) trade, or repositioning capital ahead of anticipated market volatility. The sheer scale of this USDT transfer suggests this is not a retail investor but a sophisticated player with significant influence. Why Are Whale Movements So Important to Watch? Tracking whale activity provides invaluable, real-time insight into the strategies of the market’s biggest participants. Their moves often precede larger price trends. For instance, moving stablecoins like USDT off an exchange can be a neutral or bearish signal, as it may mean the whale is parking value in a stable asset, waiting for a buying opportunity elsewhere in the market. Conversely, it could also be a precursor to deploying that capital into other cryptocurrencies. Therefore, this specific USDT transfer acts as a high-stakes puzzle piece for analysts trying to gauge future market direction. Key reasons analysts monitor these transfers include: Liquidity Signals: Large withdrawals can temporarily reduce exchange liquidity, potentially increasing volatility. Sentiment Indicators: Whales are often considered ‘smart money,’ and their actions can influence retail trader sentiment. Network Health: Such large transactions test the efficiency and cost-effectiveness of the underlying blockchain, in this case, likely Tron or Ethereum. Could This Impact Tether (USDT) and Market Stability? Tether’s USDT is the backbone of crypto trading pairs, providing essential liquidity. A transfer of this magnitude highlights both its critical role and the inherent transparency of blockchain technology. While the movement itself is neutral—simply a change of wallet ownership—it underscores the concentration of wealth and the potential for single entities to execute trades that could move markets. However, it also demonstrates the robust, audited reserves Tether maintains to back each token, as facilitating a $283 million USDT transfer requires immense treasury management. What Should Everyday Crypto Investors Take Away? For the average investor, this news is less about immediate action and more about education and context. You don’t need to react to every whale alert, but understanding their implications makes you a more informed participant. This event is a prime example of the unparalleled transparency in crypto; traditional finance rarely offers a public ledger showing movements of this scale in real-time. It reinforces the importance of: Using reliable blockchain explorers to verify large transactions. Recognizing that exchange flows are a key on-chain metric. Maintaining a long-term perspective and not being swayed by single data points. In conclusion, the stunning $283 million USDT transfer from OKX is a significant on-chain event that highlights the dynamic and institutional-scale activity within cryptocurrency markets. It serves as a reminder of the market’s maturity, the pivotal role of stablecoins, and the powerful analytical tools that blockchain transparency provides. While the ultimate intention behind the move remains shrouded in the ‘unknown wallet,’ its occurrence is a normal function of a thriving, liquid digital asset ecosystem. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What is an ‘unknown wallet’ in cryptocurrency? A: An ‘unknown wallet’ is a public blockchain address whose owner has not been publicly identified or linked to a known entity like an exchange, company, or individual. It signifies a private holder. Q2: Why would someone move so much USDT off an exchange? A: Primary reasons include enhanced security (self-custody), preparation for a large private trade (OTC desk), collateralization for DeFi protocols, or simply consolidating holdings in a personal vault. Q3: Does a large USDT transfer like this affect the token’s price? A: Typically, no. USDT is a stablecoin pegged to the US dollar. The transfer itself doesn’t affect its 1:1 peg, but the movement of capital can influence liquidity and sentiment on the exchanges involved. Q4: How can I track whale movements myself? A: You can use blockchain explorers like Etherscan or Tronscan, or follow social media accounts and services like Whale Alert that monitor and report large transactions automatically. Q5: Is this kind of large transfer a cause for concern? A: Not inherently. Large transfers are routine in global finance. In crypto, they are transparently recorded. It becomes a concern only if it’s part of a pattern indicating panic selling, exchange issues, or malicious activity, which is not evident here. Q6: What blockchain was this USDT transfer likely on? A: USDT exists on multiple blockchains. Given the size and source (OKX), it was most likely on the Tron network due to its low transaction fees, or possibly Ethereum. The exact chain can be verified via the transaction hash from Whale Alert. Found this deep dive into major whale movements helpful? The crypto world moves fast, and knowledge is power.

Akshat Siddhant, lead quant analyst at Mudrex, said the crypto market continues to display strong resilience. “Renewed whale accumulation is supporting the trend, as ETH whales have added over 450,000 ETH since mid-November, with BTC whales showing similar activity.” “Even with the US labour market displaying solid strength, the odds for a rate cut this month stand at 93%, contributing to the buying pressure. A clear move above $96,000 could accelerate BTC’s momentum toward $100,000, opening the path for fresh highs,” he added.

MSCI’s broad index of Asia Pacific shares outside Japan slipped roughly 0.1%, although it remained on track for a modest gain of about 0.5% for the week. Fresh data from Tokyo showed household spending in Japan fell at the fastest pace in nearly two years in October as inflation squeezed budgets. The yield on 10-year Japanese government bonds touched 1.94% early in the session, the highest since mid-2007, and was set for a rise of about 13.5 basis points for the week. Recent auctions drew solid demand, suggesting investors are taking advantage of cheaper bond prices. Chinese markets painted a mixed picture. The Shanghai Composite hovered near 3,875, down 0.02%, while the SZSE Component in Shenzhen added about 0.17%. The China A50 index slipped 0.17%, DJ Shanghai edged up 0.12% and Hong Kong’s Hang Seng lost about 0.40%. Europe Finds Support While US Traders Weigh Conflicting Data Across Europe, futures pointed to a slightly firmer tone. DAX futures traded near 23,880, up about 0.79%, FTSE 100 futures gained 0.19%, CAC 40 futures rose 0.43% and Euro Stoxx 50 futures added roughly 0.41%. US stock futures were mixed after Wall Street cash indices finished Thursday close to flat. Dow futures hovered around 47,850, down 0.07%, while S&P 500 futures inched up 0.11% and Nasdaq futures rose 0.22%. Traders continued to chew over a series of US data releases. A Labor Department report showed initial jobless claims dropped to their lowest level in more than three years, although analysts said the Thanksgiving holiday may have distorted the figures. A separate estimate from the Chicago Fed suggested the unemployment rate held near 4.4% in November. Factory Orders Lag Forecasts As Traders Brace For Key Fed Decision A delayed report from the Commerce Department showed factory orders rose 0.2%, missing expectations for a 0.5% increase, after an upward move in August was revised down to 1.3% as tariffs weighed on manufacturers. The closely watched non-farm payrolls report will not arrive on Friday, with the November figures scheduled for after the Federal Reserve’s December meeting because of an extended government shutdown. Investors have turned to secondary indicators, even as the backlog of official data clears only slowly. Fed funds futures now imply nearly a 90% chance of a 25-basis point rate cut next Wednesday, up sharply from pricing a month ago, and analysts describe the gathering as one of the most finely balanced meetings in years, with several policymakers having spoken publicly against further easing.

This colossal USDT transfer to OKX is more than just a number on a screen; it’s a significant event that can ripple through market liquidity and trader sentiment. But what does such a massive movement of the world’s leading stablecoin truly signify? Let’s dive into the implications. Why Does a Major USDT Transfer to OKX Matter? When a sum this large moves, it’s rarely an accident. A USDT transfer to OKX of this magnitude typically signals that a major market participant, often called a ‘whale,’ is preparing for significant action. This movement directly impacts market dynamics in several key ways: Increased Exchange Liquidity: The injection of $283 million in USDT dramatically boosts the buying power available on OKX, potentially facilitating larger trades with less price slippage. Bullish or Bearish Signal: Whales often move stablecoins to exchanges to either purchase other cryptocurrencies (a bullish signal) or to secure a safe haven from market volatility. Market Sentiment Gauge: The crypto community closely watches these transfers as a barometer for what sophisticated players might do next. Therefore, analyzing this transaction isn’t just about the ‘what’—it’s about the ‘why’ behind the move. Decoding the Source: What an ‘Unknown Wallet’ Tells Us The phrase ‘unknown wallet’ adds a layer of intrigue. In blockchain terms, this usually means the wallet is not publicly associated with a known exchange, foundation, or entity. This anonymity is common for private whale wallets or institutional cold storage. The sheer size suggests the owner is a sophisticated entity, possibly: A crypto investment fund rebalancing its portfolio. A large-scale trader or arbitrageur positioning for a market move. An institution preparing to execute an over-the-counter (OTC) deal facilitated by the exchange. While the exact identity is hidden, the destination—OKX—is highly revealing. Choosing a top-tier global exchange points to a desire for deep liquidity, security, and a wide range of trading pairs. Potential Impact on Crypto Prices and Liquidity So, what happens after a USDT transfer to OKX of this scale? The potential outcomes are crucial for every trader to understand. The most immediate effect is a surge of stablecoin liquidity on the exchange. This liquidity acts like fuel. If the whale uses this USDT to buy assets like Bitcoin or Ethereum, it can create significant upward price pressure. Conversely, if the transfer is preparatory—meant to be sold for fiat or simply parked—its immediate market impact may be muted. Historically, large stablecoin inflows to exchanges have sometimes preceded increased buying activity. However, it’s essential to remember correlation is not causation. This event should be one piece of a larger puzzle when making trading decisions, not the sole factor. Actionable Insights for Crypto Traders How should you, as an informed participant, process this news? First, avoid impulsive reactions. A major USDT transfer to OKX is a data point, not a direct trading signal. Use it to inform your broader market analysis. Monitor trading volumes on OKX, especially in major pairs like BTC/USDT and ETH/USDT, over the next 24-72 hours for signs of unusual activity. Furthermore, keep an eye on other blockchain analytics for context—is this an isolated event or part of a broader trend of stablecoin movement? In conclusion, the transfer of 283 million USDT is a powerful reminder of the scale at which major players operate in the crypto ecosystem. It highlights the critical role of stablecoins like USDT as the primary medium for moving value and positioning within markets. While the ultimate intention behind this specific USDT transfer to OKX remains unknown, it undeniably signifies a major shift of capital that warrants close attention from anyone serious about understanding crypto market flows. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What does a ‘whale’ mean in cryptocurrency? A: A ‘whale’ is a term for an individual or entity that holds a large enough amount of a cryptocurrency to potentially influence its market price through their trades. Q2: Why would someone transfer USDT to an exchange? A: The primary reasons are to trade it for other cryptocurrencies, to cash out into fiat currency, or to use it as collateral for lending or margin trading on the exchange platform. Q3: Is a large USDT transfer to an exchange always bullish? A: Not always. While it can indicate preparation to buy, it could also be for selling, OTC settlement, or simply moving funds between accounts. Context from subsequent trading activity is key. Q4: How can I track large crypto transactions like this one? A: You can use blockchain explorers (like Etherscan for Ethereum-based USDT) or follow social media accounts of tracking services like Whale Alert, which monitor and report large transactions. Q5: What is the difference between an ‘unknown wallet’ and an exchange wallet? A: An exchange wallet is publicly identified and associated with a specific trading platform (like OKX or Binance). An ‘unknown wallet’ is a private address not tagged to any known service, typically belonging to an individual or private institution. Q6: Could this large transfer affect the price of USDT itself? A> It’s highly unlikely. USDT is a stablecoin pegged to the US Dollar. Its value is maintained through reserves, not trading volume on exchanges. Large transfers don’t typically affect its 1:1 peg.

Though fees continue to decline broadly. From a valuation standpoint, Ethereum's 1,400x fees multiple puts ETH near its all-time high P/F valuation. MCap/TVL is a bit better at just over 5x. While still totally dominant in the ETF market, ETHA isn't a 'buy' until the SEC allows for asset staking. It has been a couple of months since I've provided a monthly recap for Ethereum ( ETH-USD ) via Seeking Alpha. Specifically for the iShares Ethereum ETF ( ETHA ), you'd have to go back all the way to March to find my most recent piece . Back then, I focused primarily on the organic bid for Ethereum as the gas token of the cryptocurrency market. I concluded that despite positive signs in usage, the lack of fees was a potential problem for price: Like many others who buy digital assets, my view has generally been that ETH is the 'digital gas' of the cryptocurrency market. With this view in mind, it's important for the fundamental thesis that the network generates fees. This keeps an organic bid on the token and also creates the burn mechanism, which reduces inflation. Thus, Ethereum's quickly eroding fee market even as secondary layers scale the network is making it increasingly difficult to justify ETH as an investment at this point in time. As fate would have it, ETHA has rallied more than 40% since that article. In this update, we'll again look at Ethereum's network usage. To be sure, there are positive signs there. We'll also look at the capital flow story since it is such an important part of what is driving demand for the token. And we'll get into valuation of the asset relative to fundamentals. Network Activity Through November 2025 In many ways, November 2025 was a continuation of a longer-term trend that we've witnessed on the Ethereum blockchain going back to the 'Dencun' upgrade. Network fees continue to go down as the average user fee paid for each transaction continues its slide down to just 51 cents per: November 2024 October 2025 November 2025 YoY MoM DAAs (000s) 400.5 490.6 483.7 20.8% -1.4% Transactions 36.7 48 45.7 24.5% -4.8% Fees $191.60 $41.40 $23.60 -87.7% -43.0% Avg Tx Fee $5.15 $0.84 $0.51 -90.1% -39.3% Source: Token Terminal, Transactions and Fees in millions Year-over-year, average transaction fees are down by 90%, which is very much in line with the decline in total network fees at 88%. The good news is daily active addresses hit 483k in the month. This was a 21% year-over-year increase, though a slight dip from October. Transactions hit 45.7 million in November; again, a noticeable 24.5% increase from November last year. DAAs and transactions each hit record highs back in August but have since pulled back slightly. Still, both metrics are above long term averages. Aiding this surge in transactions has been Ethereum's continued dominance in the stablecoin market. At the end of November, Ethereum accounted for over $171 billion of the market's $304 billion total supply. More importantly, Ethereum is seeing its share of stablecoin volume grow: Stable Tx Vol ($b) November 2024 October 2025 November 2025 YoY MoM Total Market $2,900 $7,300 $5,700 96.6% -21.9% Ethereum $858 $2,700 $2,500 191.2% -7.4% ETH Share 22.84% 27.00% 30.49% 33.5% 12.9% Source: Artemis Where companies like Circle Internet Group ( CRCL ) benefit from growth in stablecoin supply, Ethereum generated revenue from the actual usage of those coins, not from the yields from T-bill collateral. In November, Ethereum's $2.5 trillion in stable transaction volume was good for 30.5% of the total market. This was 33.5% year-over-year growth in transaction volume share. And it isn't just Ethereum that has seen this kind of growth: Stable Tx Vol by Chain (Artemis) Layer 2 networks like Base have also seen their share of stablecoin transaction volume grow year over year, from 18.7% last November to 22.5% this November. Base is actually now the second largest blockchain network by stablecoin transaction volume. DAT & ETF Flows Usage growth aside, capital flows have generally been the biggest driver of returns in the digital asset market since the approval of spot ETFs last year. Compared with other assets in the market, ETH's share of capital flows in 2025 has been stellar: Asset (mil) MTD Flows YTD Flows AUM Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) -$2,810 $26,783 $142,662 Ethereum -$1,397 $12,893 $25,512 Multi-asset $37.2 $1 $7,104 Solana ( SOL-USD ) $101.7 $3,389 $3,454 XRP ( XRP-USD ) $785.4 $2,890 $3,129 Total -$3,223 $46,105 $183,345 BTC Dominance 87.2% 58.1% 77.8% ETH Dominance 43.3% 28.0% 13.9% Source: CoinShares, Bloomberg as of 11/28/25 While Ethereum's 28% share of 2025 investment flows is far from Bitcoin's 58%, it is a large improvement over the 13.9% share of AUM. November was a difficult month for both assets, with a combined outflow of over $4 billion between the two. Lower market cap tokens did a bit better. From a DAT perspective, November was a month of holdings growth, though that growth has slowed considerably over the last several months. ETH ETF + DAT Holdings (StrategicETHReserve) At the end of November, ETH DATs held 6.4 million ETH, which was up slightly from the 6.1 million ETH at the end of October. However, this didn't quite make up for the roughly 425k ETH that came out of the ETFs. Combined DAT and ETH supply has been generally flat since mid-October. Valuation From a valuation perspective, we have a clear case of multiple expansion judging by the circulating price-to-fees ratio: Ethereum Circulating P/F Multiple (Token Terminal) At just under 1,400x fees, Ethereum is almost as expensive as it has ever been. I personally like the P/F ratio because I see it as a reasonable comp for an equity price to sales multiple. In the past, we've seen the coin grow into these types of extended multiples. The fact that usage is growing is a good sign. But still, ETH is not 'cheap' at these levels. Network DeFi TVL MCap/TVL Ethereum $71.0b 5.4 Solana $9.2b 8.7 BSC ( BNB-USD ) $7.1b 17.5 Source: DeFiLlama That said, viewing the coin through a DeFi TVL ratio tells a slightly different story. At $71 billion in TVL, Ethereum's market cap to TVL ratio is just 5.4. This is much lower than peer L1 networks and leaves the valuation interpretation up to each individual investor's preference. To be clear, I like fees better because I see Ethereum as essentially a settlement layer for digital commerce and tokenization. Thus, fees are an important input for Ethereum's fundamentals. iShares Ethereum ETF ETHA continues to be the monster in the Ethereum ETF market. ETF ETH Share (TheBlock) At 48% of the market supply, ETHA has been the clear winner in the Ethereum ETF game to this point. The fund's share of volume is even higher at roughly 70%. At just 25 basis points, ETHA is among the cheapest spot ETH ETFs in the market. However, unlike Grayscale's flagship ETH fund, ETHA has not yet been cleared by the SEC for asset staking. Until that happens, it's difficult for me to call the fund a better 'buy' than funds that do offer staking yields. Closing Summary I continue to believe ETH is an important part of the broader blockchain ecosystem, and any digital asset portfolio should include an allocation to the token and/or proxies of the token. While I'm certainly not of the view that Ethereum is cheap at 1,400x fees, history shows that ETH generally grows into its valuation through usage growth. So far, we're seeing growth in transactions and users in 2025. Yet, the fees are not quite there. The network has a sizable lead in stablecoins, which I view as another reason to be long the token in some way. While I like other opportunities better than ETHA specifically, assuming the fund is allowed to enable staking at some point in the future, it is definitely one to consider for long-term holding.",ETH-USD|ETHA,EN,0,0,ETH|MARKET|TRADING|ZRX|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Seeking Alpha', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/seekingalpha.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",seekingalpha,2025-12-05 03:57:24

Lawmakers rolled out a bipartisan bill that would force a 30-month halt on any export approvals for the company’s H200 and Blackwell chips. The whole point is to stop Beijing from getting hardware that could supercharge its own AI systems. The timing is not random. The White House, under Donald Trump, has been considering whether those chips should still be allowed to leave the country. That internal debate triggered pushback from lawmakers who think the US is giving China too much room to grow in high-end compute. The proposal is called the Secure and Feasible Exports Chips Act, and it orders the commerce secretary to deny export licenses for top-tier processors going into China for two and a half years. That would effectively shut down all H200 and Blackwell sales to the region. These chips sit at the heart of large AI models, data-center clusters, and national-scale compute power. Lawmakers argue China should not have direct access to anything this strong while the two countries compete for the lead in AI. Senators defend strict controls on advanced chip exports The bill is led by Pete Ricketts, the Republican chair of the Senate foreign relations East Asia sub-committee, and Chris Coons, the panel’s top Democrat. Pete said the US is ahead in the AI race because of its “dominance of global compute power” and argued that “denying Beijing access to these chips is therefore essential.” He added that locking in restrictions already set by President Trump while US firms continue to innovate would “allow us to widen our compute lead exponentially.” Chris said the contest will shape “the rest of the 21st century” and asked whether the future will be built on American ideas of “free thought and free markets” or those of the Chinese Communist Party. Other backers include Republicans Tom Cotton and Dave McCormick, along with Democrats Jeanne Shaheen and Andy Kim. Their push lands in the middle of deeper tension in Washington. Some China hawks believe Donald Trump is avoiding stronger security actions to protect the trade deal he negotiated with Xi Jinping last October. On Wednesday, the Financial Times reported that the US Treasury paused a plan to sanction China’s Ministry of State Security over a cyber operation called “Salt Typhoon,” which hit American telecom companies. Senior US officials also said the administration is not planning major new export controls on China for now. Industry leaders clash with Washington over chip policy Tech analyst Saif Khan from the Institute for Progress said China would gain major advantages if it secured unrestricted access to the H200. Saif said it would let Beijing build frontier-level supercomputers for cutting-edge AI, even if costs were slightly higher than running Blackwell chips. He added that it would also help Chinese cloud firms compete with large US cloud providers. Jensen Huang, Nvidia’s chief, met Donald Trump and Republican senators from the banking committee on Wednesday. Before going in, Jensen said China would not accept weaker chips and argued US companies should be able to export their best hardware instead of downgraded versions. Senator John Kennedy, a Republican on the committee, dismissed Jensen’s stance. Kennedy told reporters that Jensen was not a “credible source” on what technology the US should send to China. Kennedy said, “He’s got more money than the Father, the Son and the Holy Ghost, and he wants even more,” before adding that Jensen was not who he would trust for “objective advice.” Former White House strategist Steve Bannon, a key figure in the Maga movement, said the US should stop sending advanced chips to China altogether. Bannon pointed to the rise of Chinese AI groups like DeepSeek and said, “If this is in fact a ‘Sputnik Moment’ because of DeepSeek then we should ban all chip sales, especially high-end, but also stop all financial support — no access to debt or equity capital markets, no training, no Chinese students — just like in the cold war about nuclear weapons.” Bannon also took aim at Jensen and David Sacks, the White House AI adviser who supports a controlled export plan to make foreign firms rely on the American tech stack. Bannon said, “David Sacks has acted as the agent for the Chinese Communist party and Jensen Huang is the arms merchant.” When asked about the bill, Nvidia said the AI action plan “wisely recognizes non-military businesses everywhere should be able to choose the American technology stack, promoting US jobs and promoting national security.” Responding to Bannon, the company said, “AI is not an atomic bomb. No one should have an atomic bomb. Everyone should have AI.” The smartest crypto minds already read our newsletter. Want in?

Bitcoin Has Seen Historic Growth In Realized Cap This Cycle On-chain analytics firm Glassnode has released its Q4 2025 Digital Assets Report in collaboration with crypto investment firm Fasanara Digital, shedding light on how the market landscape has developed in the fourth quarter of 2025. One of the things the report has talked about is the trend in the Realized Cap of Bitcoin. This capitalization model calculates the total value of the cryptocurrency by assuming the the value of each individual token is equal to the price at which it was last transacted on the blockchain. The last transaction of any token is likely to represent the last time it changed hands, so the price at its time could be considered as its current cost basis. As such, the Realized Cap is a sum of the acquisition values of all coins in circulation. In other words, the model represents the total amount of capital that the investors used to purchase the asset’s supply. Considering this, changes in the indicator naturally correspond to the netflow of capital. Below is a chart that shows how the Bitcoin Realized Cap has fluctuated over the last few years. As displayed in the graph, the monthly change in the Bitcoin Realized Cap has remained positive over the last couple of years, indicating that the network has been enjoying a sustained expansion in stored capital. The rate of inflows has varied a lot over the cycle, however, accelerating to high levels during rallies and slowing down during flat or bearish periods. Most recently, the monthly increase in the metric hit a high of $39.8 billion in October, but the bearish momentum since then has meant a cooldown to $15 billion. Following the continued rise in the Realized Cap, its value has reached a new all-time high (ATH) of $1.1 trillion. The report noted that this marks “a historic milestone that underscores Bitcoin’s continued evolution as a globally held, high-liquidity asset.” The Realized Cap has clearly witnessed a significant amount of growth this cycle. But how does it stack up against the capital inflows of the past cycles? Here is another chart, this one comparing the cumulative Realized Cap change for each cycle: In total, the current cycle has attracted over $732 billion in capital. The last cycle saw $388 billion in inflows, and the two cycles before that about $90 billion combined. Thus, the latest cycle has not only outpaced each of the past cycles, but it has in fact seen a higher Realized Cap increase than all of them combined. BTC Price Bitcoin’s latest recovery has so far been holding as its price is trading around $92,800.",Bitcoin News|bitcoin|Bitcoin Cycle|bitcoin inflows|Bitcoin Realized Cap|btc|BTCUSDT,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|BUSINESS|TRADING|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-12-05 04:00:16

Related Reading: Eric Trump Says Bitcoin Could Hit $500,000, Stands By ABTC Strategy Bank Moves Could Be The Spark According to market coverage, Bitcoin tumbled about $5,000 in roughly three hours during early December, wiping more than $200 billion from the broader crypto market and triggering nearly $700 million in liquidations. That sudden drop has been linked to moves in traditional markets, not a single crypto event. Some analysts point to a change in Japan’s bond market that is pressuring the long-running yen carry trade. Reports say the Bank of Japan’s policy path is now in focus, with a key decision due in mid-December that could move global risk appetite and the yen. Whales Bought While Prices Fell On-chain trackers show large investors added to holdings during the drop. According to on-chain data aggregators, accumulator addresses picked up about 375,000 BTC over recent weeks. That figure, if measured the way those firms define “whales,” suggests big players were buying into weakness. Miners Also Cut Back Sales Based on market commentary, miner selling has slowed sharply. One widely cited dataset shows miner outflows fell from roughly 23,000 BTC per month to about 3,672 BTC in the most recent window. That drop in miner supply was flagged as a possible tailwind for price if it persists. ETF Money Flows And Model Targets Reports have also tracked ETF movements, noting several billion dollars left Bitcoin ETFs in November, and that flows remain a key short-term force for price direction. Meanwhile, major banks have published valuation work that places fair-value scenarios well above current levels — for example, JPMorgan analysts have argued a model-based target near $170,000 under certain assumptions. How Realistic Is A $180,000 Outcome? Putting these pieces together, hitting $180,000 by the end of 2026 is possible in a bullish scenario where institutional demand resumes, whale buying continues, miner selling stays low, and central-bank moves help risk appetite. But it would require sizeable, sustained inflows and a benign macro backdrop across many months — not just a one-off rally. Garlinghouse remains optimistic about his forecast. Related Reading: Bitcoin Trail Ends: $29M Seized After European Authorities Shut Down Cryptomixer Signals To Watch Next Bank of Japan guidance in mid-December could influence Bitcoin’s next move. Daily ETF flows and open interest have shown significant shifts recently. On-chain data indicates that accumulators added around 375,000 BTC while miner selling dropped sharply. These figures, if confirmed by the original data sources, may play a major role in shaping near-term price action. Garlinghouse’s $180,000 call is a high-profile, optimistic view that matches other bullish models on the market. Reports show real volatility and major flows are already shaping price. For now, the forecast is an opinion rooted in plausible scenarios — one to watch, not a certainty.

The price is now correcting gains and might struggle to stay in a positive zone. XRP price started a downside correction and tested the $2.080 zone. The price is now trading below $2.120 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. There is a bearish trend line forming with resistance at $2.110 on the hourly chart of the XRP/USD pair (data source from Kraken). The pair could start another increase if it clears $2.150. XRP Price Dips Again XRP price started a downside correction from the $2.220 zone, like Bitcoin and Ethereum . The price dipped below the $2.20 and $2.150 levels to enter a consolidation phase. The price even dipped below the 50% Fib retracement level of the upward move from the $1.984 swing low to the $2.220 high. Besides, there is a bearish trend line forming with resistance at $2.110 on the hourly chart of the XRP/USD pair. However, the bulls remained active above the $2.080 support. The price is now trading below $2.10 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. If there is a fresh upward move, the price might face resistance near the $2.110 level and the trend line. The first major resistance is near the $2.150 level, above which the price could rise and test $2.220. A clear move above the $2.220 resistance might send the price toward the $2.2850 resistance. Any more gains might send the price toward the $2.350 resistance. The next major hurdle for the bulls might be near $2.420. Another Decline? If XRP fails to clear the $2.150 resistance zone, it could start a fresh decline. Initial support on the downside is near the $2.080 level and the 61.8% Fib retracement level of the upward move from the $1.984 swing low to the $2.220 high. The next major support is near the $2.040 level. If there is a downside break and a close below the $2.040 level, the price might continue to decline toward $2.00. The next major support sits near the $1.9850 zone, below which the price could continue lower toward $1.920. Technical Indicators Hourly MACD – The MACD for XRP/USD is now gaining pace in the bearish zone. Hourly RSI (Relative Strength Index) – The RSI for XRP/USD is now below the 50 level.

Former Wemade CEO Jang Hyun-guk’s acquittal is now final, marking a pivotal moment that raises important questions about regulatory boundaries and market transparency in digital assets. What Were the WEMIX Manipulation Charges About? Prosecutors initially indicted Jang Hyun-guk in August 2023, alleging he manipulated the market by making false announcements about WEMIX coin liquidation. The core accusation centered on his early 2022 statement that he would stop liquidating WEMIX coins. Authorities claimed this announcement artificially supported both Wemade’s stock price and the WEMIX token value, allowing for improper profit-taking. The prosecution built their case on the premise that this constituted market manipulation. However, the court ultimately disagreed with this interpretation, leading to the initial acquittal that has now become final. Why Did the Acquittal Become Final? The legal process reached its conclusion through a straightforward procedural step: neither side appealed the verdict. South Korean prosecutors had until December 4 to challenge the second-instance court’s not-guilty ruling. When they declined to file an appeal, and with Jang (now CEO of Nexus) also not appealing, the acquittal automatically became final on December 5. This development matters for several reasons: Legal Precedent: The case establishes boundaries for what constitutes manipulation in cryptocurrency markets Regulatory Clarity: Provides clearer guidelines for crypto executives regarding public communications Market Confidence: Reduces uncertainty surrounding WEMIX and related projects What Does This Mean for Cryptocurrency Regulation? The final resolution of these WEMIX manipulation charges offers valuable insights into how legal systems are adapting to cryptocurrency markets. Traditional securities laws don’t always translate perfectly to digital assets, creating gray areas that courts must navigate. Key takeaways from this case include: Prosecutors must meet high evidentiary standards when alleging cryptocurrency manipulation Executive statements about token economics require careful legal consideration The line between market communication and manipulation remains complex in crypto Moreover, this outcome suggests that regulators may need more specific frameworks for addressing alleged cryptocurrency market abuses, rather than relying solely on existing financial regulations. How Does This Impact WEMIX and the Broader Market? With the WEMIX manipulation charges now definitively resolved, several immediate effects emerge. First, uncertainty that may have surrounded WEMIX trading diminishes significantly. Second, the precedent could influence how similar cases are prosecuted globally. For investors and market participants, this case highlights crucial considerations: Legal risks associated with cryptocurrency projects vary by jurisdiction Executive communications carry significant legal weight in crypto markets Regulatory scrutiny continues to intensify across global crypto markets Final Thoughts on the WEMIX Legal Resolution The conclusive acquittal in the WEMIX manipulation charges case represents more than just one executive’s legal victory. It signals how legal systems are wrestling with cryptocurrency regulation’s complexities. As digital assets continue evolving, we can expect more legal tests that define acceptable market practices. This outcome provides temporary clarity but also underscores the need for more precise regulatory frameworks. The cryptocurrency industry benefits from clear rules, and cases like this help establish those boundaries through legal precedent. Frequently Asked Questions What exactly was Jang Hyun-guk accused of? He faced allegations of manipulating WEMIX’s market price by falsely announcing he would stop liquidating WEMIX coins in early 2022, which prosecutors claimed artificially supported both the token and Wemade stock prices. Why didn’t prosecutors appeal the acquittal? While specific reasons weren’t publicly disclosed, prosecutors typically consider evidence strength, legal precedent, and resource allocation when deciding whether to appeal. Their decision suggests they assessed their case as unlikely to succeed in higher courts. Does this mean WEMIX had no manipulation issues? The court’s verdict means prosecutors didn’t prove their case beyond reasonable doubt. It doesn’t necessarily make broader statements about WEMIX’s market activities, only that specific charges against Jang weren’t legally substantiated. How might this affect future cryptocurrency regulation? This case highlights challenges in applying traditional securities laws to cryptocurrencies. It may push regulators toward creating more tailored frameworks for digital assets rather than relying on existing financial regulations. What is Jang Hyun-guk’s current role? He now serves as CEO of Nexus, having moved on from his position at Wemade. The legal proceedings didn’t prevent his continued involvement in the cryptocurrency industry. Could similar charges be brought against other crypto executives? Yes, but this case establishes precedent that may make prosecutors more cautious. They’ll likely need stronger evidence and clearer legal theories before pursuing similar WEMIX manipulation charges type cases.

The problem exists in a particular chip made by MediaTek, a company based in Taiwan. The chip in question is the Dimensity 7300, also called MT6878, which can be found in numerous Android smartphones currently on the market, including the Solana Seeker . What makes this security issue particularly serious is where it sits. The weakness is located in the chip’s boot ROM, which is the very first part of the phone that starts up when you turn it on. Because this code is permanently built into the physical chip itself, there is no way to fix it through regular software updates or security patches. Ledger’s research division, known as the Donjon team, studied how the chip operates. They discovered that by sending carefully timed electromagnetic pulses to the chip right as it boots up, they could trick it into giving them the highest level of access possible. In technical terms, they reached what’s called EL3, which is the most powerful privilege level in ARM chip design. Ledger warned about the serious implications of this discovery “From malware that users could be tricked into installing on their machines, to fully remote, zero-click exploits commonly used by government-backed entities, there is simply no way to safely store and use one’s private keys on those devices,” they wrote. Ledger’s fault injection setup. Source: Ledger This news arrives during a period when attacks targeting people who own cryptocurrency are becoming more frequent. A study released in July by Chainalysis showed that more than $2.17 billion has already been stolen from crypto services in 2025. That amount exceeds everything that was stolen throughout all of 2024. Most cryptocurrency thefts happen through online methods like phishing schemes and fraudulent operations, rather than physical attacks. However, the research shows that physical vulnerabilities do exist. The Donjon researchers found that once they figured out the exact moment to send the electromagnetic pulse, each try took roughly one second. Their success rate ranged from 0.1% to 1% per attempt, which meant they could completely take over a device within just a few minutes when working in laboratory settings. Ledger, which makes the well-known Nano hardware wallets, stopped short of telling people to completely avoid using wallets on smartphones. However, the findings do point to a new way that both software creators and regular users could be targeted. A cryptocurrency wallet is a program that holds a person’s public and private keys, allowing them to send, receive, and keep track of their digital money. Hardware wallets, sometimes called “cold wallets,” keep these private keys completely offline on a separate physical device that’s disconnected from the internet, protecting them from attacks that can reach phones or computers. Software wallets, also known as “hot wallets,” are applications that let people store their digital money on different devices, but this leaves users vulnerable to hacking attempts and phishing operations. MediaTek says Ledger’s fault-injection test is out of scope MediaTek had responded to the discovery in a statement that Ledger included in their report. The company said that electromagnetic fault-injection attacks were considered “out of scope” for the MT6878 chip because it was built as a regular consumer product, not as a high-security component meant for financial systems or sensitive information. “For products with higher hardware security requirements, such as hardware crypto wallets, we believe that they should be designed with appropriate countermeasures against EMFI attacks,” MediaTek stated. Ledger emphasized that devices using the MT6878 chip will continue to have this vulnerability because the flaw exists in the unchangeable silicon material itself. The company stressed that secure-element chips remain essential for anyone who manages their own cryptocurrency or handles other sensitive security operations, as these specialized components are specifically built to resist both hardware and software attacks. “Smartphones’ threat model, just like any piece of technology that can be lost or stolen, cannot reasonably exclude hardware attacks,” Ledger wrote. “But the SoCs they use are no more exempt from the effects of fault injection than microcontrollers are, and security should really ultimately rely on Secure Elements, especially for self-custody.” Claim your free seat in an exclusive crypto trading community - limited to 1,000 members.",Tech|MediaTek|Solana|Solana Seeker,EN,0,0,SOL|TECHNOLOGY|WALLET|RESEARCH|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-12-05 05:00:12

Reports say the same address also moved $5 million USDT around the same time. These large transfers were flagged publicly by Onchain Lens and picked up by multiple crypto news outlets. Transaction Values And Timing Onchain tracking shows the 100 million TRX was worth close to $28 million at the time of the move. The USDT transfer of $5 million happened within a minute of the TRX withdrawal, which has led observers to call the action coordinated rather than routine. Based on reports, the close timing and mixed asset types — token plus stablecoin — drew extra attention from traders and on-chain sleuths. Data also shows the Justin Sun-linked wallet now holds a much larger TRX balance than just this single transfer. Tracking services report the address sits at about 492 million TRX, a holding with a notional value near $138 million based on market rates at the time. That swelling balance has prompted talk that accumulation of TRX has been steady in recent days. A wallet linked to Justin Sun ( @justinsuntron ) withdrew 100M $TRX worth $27.96M from #Binance and also withdrew $5M $USDT . https://t.co/4d2utqwsv0 pic.twitter.com/k40pMUj15d — Onchain Lens (@OnchainLens) December 3, 2025 Market Reaction And Liquidity Initial market moves were muted. Some exchange data and commentaries noted a mild uptick in TRX price after the news, suggesting traders saw the outflow as removing sell pressure from exchange order books. Analysts who track exchange liquidity say large withdrawals like this can shrink available sell-side supply and can support price stability if demand holds. Still, any clear price trend will depend on what happens next with the withdrawn tokens. No Official Word Yet There has been no public statement from Justin Sun or TRON explaining the transfers. Without confirmation, motives remain speculative. Observers are weighing a few common possibilities: long-term cold storage, staking or protocol use, or internal treasury moves. All of those ideas are possible, but none are confirmed by the team. What Could Happen Next If the tokens stay offline, some traders may view the move as bullish since it cuts the floating supply held on big exchanges. If the funds are later sold or used to provide liquidity, the effect could swing the other way. Reports point out that similar moves by major holders have sometimes been followed by quiet accumulation and other times by large transfers into trading venues — timing and intent matter.

The investment products have seen a remarkable performance since the launch of Canary Capital’s XRPC, the first single-token XRP spot ETF, on November 13, positioning the funds as the fastest-growing altcoin-based category. Notably, XRPC surpassed all initial expectations and debuted on Nasdaq with a total volume of $58 million, recording around $357.54 million in positive net flows in 13 days. Last week, the second group of XRP funds went live, becoming the largest US ETF launches of 2025 with over $60 million in net inflows each during their first day. Moreover, the category, led by Grayscale’s GXRP and Franklin Templeton’s XRPZ, surpassed other major ETFs in single-day inflows, including those based on the largest cryptocurrencies by market capitalization, Solana, Bitcoin (BTC), and Ether (ETH). Amid this week’s market recovery, XRP ETFs saw $89.65 million on Monday, $67.7 million the following day, and an additional $50.27 million on Wednesday, for a cumulative net inflow of $207.66 million during the first three days of December. As a result, the leading category surpassed both Bitcoin ETFs’ $52.4 million and Ethereum ETFs’ $51.3 million positive net flows, respectively, during the same three-day period. With a total of $874.28 million in inflows in 13 days, spot XRP ETFs have surpassed the $618.62 million total inflows of SOL ETFs, which held the record among the second wave of altcoin-based investment products. Solana ETFs Demand Loses Steam While XRP ETFs take the spotlight, Solana funds’ momentum has slowed, seeing their largest days of outflows this week. According to SoSovalue data, the investment products recorded $32.9 million in outflows on December 3, marking their third negative net flows day since the category debuted on October 28. Despite pulling out positive net flows, Bitwise’s BSOL, Fidelity’s FSOL, and Grayscale’s GSOL were unable to absorb 21Shares’ TSOL $41.8 million in outflows. This performance also marks the fourth negative day for TSOL over the past week. As reported by NewsBTC, Solana ETFs experienced a record performance in November despite the market correction, with $613 million in inflows during their 22 consecutive day positive streak. Related Reading: Solana Eyes Major Resistance After $140 Reclaim, But Analyst Questions SOL’s Strength However, the remarkable streak ended a week ago when TSOL registered negative net flows for the first time, and the category was unable to absorb them, recording outflows of $8.1 million.

On December 3, the funds registered $32.19 million in outflows, amounting to a negative net flow of $700,000 for the first half of the week, despite the altcoin’s recent price recovery.

This dramatic shift occurred just one day after the funds had posted net inflows, highlighting the volatile and sentiment-driven nature of this new investment vehicle. For investors tracking the pulse of institutional crypto adoption, this data point serves as a crucial reality check. What Caused the US Spot ETH ETFs Outflow? According to reliable data from Farside Investors, the outflow was not uniform across all funds. Instead, it revealed a clear divergence in investor confidence. The movement of capital tells a story of selective risk assessment in the US spot ETH ETFs landscape. While most funds saw money exit, one notable player bucked the trend entirely, attracting significant capital amidst the sell-off. A Tale of Two Strategies: BlackRock vs. Grayscale The data reveals a stark contrast between fund managers. BlackRock’s iShares Ethereum Trust (ETHA) emerged as the sole winner, attracting $28.4 million in positive flows. This suggests that some investors view BlackRock’s offering as a more stable or preferable long-term vehicle. Conversely, outflows were concentrated elsewhere: Grayscale Ethereum Trust (ETHE): Led the exodus with $31 million flowing out. Grayscale Ethereum Mini Trust: Followed with $21 million in outflows. Fidelity’s Ethereum Fund (FETH): Recorded outflows of $17.9 million. This pattern indicates that investors may be rotating capital or taking profits, particularly from the funds with longer track records or different fee structures. Why Should You Care About ETH ETF Flows? Daily flow data for US spot ETH ETFs is more than just a number. It acts as a real-time gauge of institutional and sophisticated investor sentiment towards Ethereum. Sustained inflows typically signal building confidence and potential price support, while outflows can indicate profit-taking, risk aversion, or sector rotation. Therefore, monitoring these trends is essential for understanding broader market dynamics. Key Takeaways from the $41.5M Shift This single day’s activity offers several actionable insights. First, the market for these products remains in its early, volatile stage. Second, not all US spot ETH ETFs are created equal in the eyes of investors, with brand and structure playing key roles. Finally, this ebb and flow is a normal part of a new financial product finding its equilibrium in the market. In summary, the sudden $41.5 million net outflow from US spot Ethereum ETFs underscores the fragile and evolving nature of crypto investment products. While BlackRock’s fund demonstrated resilience, the broader trend suggests a moment of caution among investors. As the market matures, observing whether these outflows are a one-day blip or the start of a longer trend will be critical for gauging Ethereum’s institutional adoption trajectory. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) What are US spot ETH ETFs? US spot ETH ETFs are exchange-traded funds that hold actual Ethereum (ETH). They trade on traditional stock exchanges, allowing investors to gain exposure to Ethereum’s price without directly buying or storing the cryptocurrency. Why did the ETFs see net outflows? Net outflows occur when the total money withdrawn from the ETFs exceeds the total money invested. This can happen due to profit-taking by investors, broader market uncertainty, or rotation into other assets. Is BlackRock’s ETHA outperforming others? On December 4th, yes. BlackRock’s ETHA was the only fund to see net inflows ($28.4M), while others saw outflows. This may be due to investor confidence in BlackRock’s brand, its fee structure, or its market positioning. Should I be worried about these outflows? A single day of outflows is not necessarily a cause for major concern. New financial products often experience volatility as they establish themselves. It becomes a trend to watch if outflows persist over several days or weeks. How can I track this data myself? Data firms like Farside Investors provide daily flow updates. Many financial news websites and crypto analytics platforms also aggregate and report this information regularly. Do ETF flows directly affect Ethereum’s price? They can have an indirect influence. Large inflows can create buying pressure on the underlying ETH, while large outflows can create selling pressure, as the fund managers adjust their holdings to match the fund’s shares.

The crypto analytics firm posted a chart from its platform that tracks XRP’s price against total positive and negative comments, along with a combined sentiment line. Recent readings show social chatter around XRP tilting heavily bearish, a clear shift from the more even mix of views seen earlier in the year. Santiment’s sentiment gauge tracks price alongside streams of positive and negative comments, and its latest signals show the balance tipping into what it labels the fear zone as bearish messages start to dominate. XRP (-31% in the past 2 months), unlike Bitcoin, is seeing the most fear, uncertainty, & doubt (FUD) since October, according to our social data. Circles indicate days where there are abnormally higher BULLISH comments compared to BEARISH comments, about XRP (Greed Zone)… https://t.co/lJNW8zlRwK pic.twitter.com/ZoFmwrtw3h — Santiment (@santimentfeed) December 4, 2025 Traders Watch For A Repeat Of November’s Reflexive Rebound On this model, red circles mark days when optimism overwhelms pessimism, the greed zone, while green circles mark sessions when negative commentary swamps bullish talk, a fear zone that often lines up with capitulation by weaker holders. The firm pointed traders back to late November. It wrote, “The last time we saw near this level of fear from the crowd was Nov. 21st, and $XRP’s price immediately rallied +22% over the next 3 days. After that, greed took over and the rally came to a quick halt. As of now, an opportunity appears to be emerging just like 2 weeks ago.” Santiment urged followers to keep an eye on the same dashboard, saying, “Monitor how sentiment continues to shift here on this chart, and see what others in crypto can’t.” The suggestion is that crowd psychology around XRP may once again be setting up a reflexive move, where extreme pessimism creates fuel for a short squeeze. XRP Extends Losses As Market Drift Pressures Major Altcoins In price terms, XRP was last down about 4.5% at $2.09, extending a loss of roughly 7% over the past month. The total crypto market value slipped about 1% to $3.22 trillion on the day, a pullback that has weighed on major altcoins even as liquidity remains concentrated in the largest names. XRP shows relative stability compared with some smaller tokens, although it still feels the drag from thinning order books and cautious positioning. These moves unfold against a backdrop of uncertainty around upcoming US policy decisions, softer global risk appetite and rapid position cuts by leveraged traders who had crowded into earlier rallies. Analysts watching the token say XRP can still grind toward the $2.50 to $2.75 area if cross border liquidity flows improve and momentum builds around stablecoin projects on the XRP Ledger. Away from the charts, Ripple has been working to deepen its institutional reach. Last month, the company said it was expanding in the US with the launch of digital asset spot prime brokerage services . The move follows its acquisition of multi asset prime brokerage firm Hidden Road, which has been folded into Ripple Prime, combining regulatory and operational setups from both groups into a single trading and custody platform for professional clients.

On-air forecast tickers and a CNBC-branded page will also be included on Kalshi’s platform. The deal comes as Kalshi recently expanded its media presence through a similar arrangement with CNN and builds on its growth after an $11 billion valuation. Meanwhile, Polymarket is strengthening its position in the sector through partnerships with DraftKings, PrizePicks and UFC parent TKO Group as it prepares a CFTC-approved token launch. At the same time, YZi Labs, which was founded by Binance’s CZ, is increasing its exposure to prediction markets with new platforms like Predict.fun and the fast-growing Opinion. CNBC Adds Kalshi Forecasts CNBC took a big step into the prediction market space through a new multi-year partnership with Kalshi. Beginning in 2026, CNBC will incorporate Kalshi’s event-probability data across its television programming, digital products, and subscriber platforms. Shows like “Squawk Box” and “Fast Money” will feature a dedicated on-screen ticker displaying real-time forecast movements, while Kalshi will host a CNBC-branded page on its platform showcasing markets curated by the network. Kalshi CEO Tarek Mansour described the collaboration as a shift toward the “next evolution” of financial reporting, and argued that prediction markets offer an entirely new layer of insight by quantifying expectations about what may happen next rather than simply reporting current conditions. Announcement from CNBC CNBC president KC Sullivan called prediction markets an increasingly important analytical tool and believes that Kalshi’s forecast data is a powerful extension of traditional financial journalism. The partnership builds on Kalshi’s growing presence across major media outlets, coming just days after the company announced a similar integration deal with CNN for both on-air analysis and newsroom reporting. Kalshi was launched in 2018, and quickly became one of the largest regulated prediction market operators in the United States, offering tradable markets on elections, economic indicators, sports results and other real-world outcomes. The company’s prominence surged even more after its $1 billion capital raise in November at an $11 billion valuation, which made its 29-year-old co-founders billionaires. CEO Luana Lopes Lara was recognized by Forbes as the world’s youngest self-made woman billionaire. While Kalshi expands its footprint through mainstream media partnerships, blockchain-based competitor Polymarket is experiencing its own wave of momentum. Polymarket inked multiple high-profile partnerships with established brands including DraftKings, PrizePicks and TKO Group Holdings, which selected the platform as the official prediction partner for UFC and Zuffa Boxing. Its valuation reached $10 billion in October, and the company is preparing to launch a token after securing approval from the US Commodity Futures Trading Commission to operate an intermediated trading platform. YZi Labs Pushes Into Prediction Markets Meanwhile, the venture capital firm that was founded by Binance co-founder Changpeng “CZ” Zhao, YZi Labs, is intensifying its focus on prediction markets as well. On Wednesday, CZ shared YZi-backed Predict.fun as a new prediction platform launching on BNB Chain, where users can earn yield on funds while their predictions are active. He accompanied the announcement with a disclaimer that the post was not an endorsement. The move follows a dramatic rise in trading activity on Opinion, another YZi-supported prediction platform that stepped up as one of the most active markets in the sector. Opinion was created by Hong Kong-based Opinion Labs in 2023, and launched exclusively on BNB Chain in October after securing $5 million in seed funding led by YZi Labs, with participation from Animoca Ventures, Echo, Manifold Trading and Amber Group. While CZ described YZi’s involvement as a minority investment aimed at providing strategic value, the platform’s breakout growth attracted a lot of industry attention. Within just four weeks of its debut, Opinion’s weekly trading volume surged to almost $1.5 billion, surpassing Kalshi’s $1.2 billion and Polymarket’s roughly $1 billion, according to data from Dune Analytics. With 40% of the total $3.7 billion weekly market share, Opinion set a new sector record, even eclipsing Polymarket’s peak during the 2024 US election cycle. The sudden rise led to questions from market analysts, who argue that the acceleration seems too sharp to be entirely organic. TEN Protocol co-founder Cais Manai said that Opinion’s volume spike “looks more like engineered activity than a sudden mass onboarding,” and suggested that prediction market volume across the industry may be inflated during the current boom. Despite broader crypto market softness, prediction markets as a whole reached new highs in November, with cumulative activity jumping past $13 billion. With both Predict.fun and Opinion gaining traction on BNB Chain, YZi’s portfolio is at the center of one of crypto’s fastest-expanding sectors.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,EXCHANGE|MARKET|TRADING|BNB|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-12-05 05:30:00

Fresh data reveals a total net outflow of $194.6 million on December 4th, signaling a potential shift in short-term investor sentiment toward these popular funds. This consistent pullback raises important questions about market dynamics and what it could mean for Bitcoin’s price trajectory. What Do the Spot Bitcoin ETF Outflow Numbers Show? According to reliable data from Farside Investors, the outflow was widespread. No single spot Bitcoin ETF managed to record a net inflow for the day. This uniform trend suggests the selling pressure is not isolated to one fund but reflects a broader, market-wide movement. Let’s break down where the money came from. The leader in outflows was BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT), which saw $113 million exit. This is notable because IBIT has been a dominant force in gathering assets since its launch. Other major contributors to the spot Bitcoin ETF outflow included: Fidelity Wise Origin Bitcoin Fund (FBTC): $54.2 million outflow. VanEck Bitcoin Trust (HODL): $14.3 million outflow. Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC): $10.1 million outflow. Why Are Investors Pulling Money from Spot Bitcoin ETFs? Understanding this trend requires looking at the broader context. Spot Bitcoin ETFs are designed to track the price of Bitcoin directly, making them a bellwether for institutional and retail investor appetite. Two consecutive days of net outflows could point to several factors. First, profit-taking is a common driver. After a strong rally, some investors may be locking in gains. Second, macroeconomic concerns, such as interest rate expectations or dollar strength, can trigger risk-off behavior across all assets, including crypto. Finally, it may reflect short-term volatility or uncertainty specific to the cryptocurrency market’s near-term direction. What Does This Mean for the Future of Bitcoin? While two days of outflows for spot Bitcoin ETFs is noteworthy, it’s crucial to maintain perspective. The overall adoption story for these investment vehicles remains strong, with billions in assets under management. However, monitoring these flows provides a real-time gauge of sentiment. If outflows persist, it could indicate a period of consolidation or correction for Bitcoin’s price. Conversely, a quick return to inflows would suggest the recent withdrawals were a temporary blip. For long-term investors, these fluctuations highlight the importance of a disciplined strategy rather than reacting to daily data points. Key Takeaways from the Recent ETF Activity The data delivers clear insights. The spot Bitcoin ETF market is experiencing a moment of pressure, with BlackRock’s fund seeing the most significant single withdrawal. This activity serves as a reminder that even popular, regulated crypto products are subject to market cycles and investor sentiment shifts. For anyone involved in cryptocurrency markets, keeping an eye on spot Bitcoin ETF flows is now an essential part of market analysis. These funds have become a major conduit for capital, and their movements often precede or confirm broader price trends. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q: What is a net outflow in a spot Bitcoin ETF? A: A net outflow occurs when the total amount of money withdrawn from the ETF by shareholders exceeds the total amount of new money invested in it on a given day. Q: Is two days of outflows from spot Bitcoin ETFs a major concern? A> It signals a shift in short-term sentiment but does not necessarily reverse the long-term trend of institutional adoption. Market cycles typically include periods of profit-taking. Q: Which spot Bitcoin ETF had the largest outflow? A> On December 4th, BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) experienced the largest single outflow, totaling $113 million. Q: How can I track spot Bitcoin ETF flows myself? A> Data is aggregated and published by several analytics firms, including Farside Investors, which is cited in this report. Financial news websites also regularly cover this data. Q: Do outflows from spot Bitcoin ETFs directly cause Bitcoin’s price to drop? A> There is a correlation. To meet redemption requests, ETF issuers may need to sell Bitcoin holdings, which can create selling pressure in the underlying market. Q: Have spot Bitcoin ETFs seen outflows before? A> Yes. Since their launch, these ETFs have experienced both periods of massive inflows and occasional days or weeks of outflows, reflecting normal market volatility.

Citi analysts led by Max Layton said in their Friday note that the team sees an average of $13,000 in the second quarter because metal is being pulled into the U.S. and leaving other regions short. Traders are currently keeping a close eye on trade risks as more shipments moved toward American ports ahead of possible import tariffs, according to Jane Street. Mercuria moves metal out of LME warehouses The strain in the system showed up in warehouse activity. Mercuria Energy Group Ltd. ordered about $500 million worth of copper to be taken out of London Metal Exchange storage, which is the biggest cancellation of stock in more than ten years, but also does match the tightening outlook laid out by Citi . Max said the analysts had “conviction in copper upside through 2026 supported by multiple bullish catalysts, including an incrementally constructive fundamental and macro backdrop.” Meanwhile, Macquarie Group analysts led by Peter Taylor said in a Thursday note that the metal could still hit fresh highs but added that prices above $11,000 a ton are not sustainable because the physical market is not tight enough. They pointed to the surge in exchange inventories, which surged above 656,000 tons, the highest since 2018, with nearly two-thirds held in Comex warehouses in the U.S. The call lined up with comments from Goldman Sachs, which said earlier this week it does not see a real shortage until 2029. Traders track moves in gold, oil, and Fed expectations While copper held strong, gold is struggling, as traders locked in profits and waited for next week’s Federal Reserve meeting.Gold futures slipped by 0.3% to $4,220.10 per ounce and spot gold eased 0.3% to $4,190.13. The World Gold Council said it expects prices to rise between 15% and 30% in 2026. A Reuters poll of 39 analysts and traders had placed the median 2025 forecast at $3,400 per troy ounce, up from $3,220 in July, with expectations for an average of $4,275 in 2026. Energy markets inched higher. Brent crude traded 0.3% higher at $62.85 per barrel, and West Texas Intermediate rose 0.4% to $59.16. Traders reacted to new Ukrainian attacks on Russian oil sites, which raised concerns about supply at a time when peace talks stalled. Anyway, rate expectations stayed central across all markets. The CME FedWatch tool showed traders fully pricing in a 25-basis-point cut that would bring the federal funds rate to 3.75% to 4%, with another cut expected in December. A separate Reuters poll that was taken between November 28 and December 4 found 82% of economists expecting the same 25-basis-point reduction at next week’s meeting.

This funding, similar to FTX’s famous “meme round,” aims to support further AlphaTON’s ambitious plans for developing its artificial intelligence and high-performance computing infrastructure. According to the company’s plan, the expansion of this infrastructure will enhance Telegram’s Cocoon AI network and support the firm in pursuing mergers. It will also help AlphaTON acquire businesses that generate funds within the Telegram ecosystem. AlphaTON attains a significant milestone after overcoming the SEC’s ‘baby-shelf’ limitation Following AlphaTON’s meme shelf registration announcement , analysts discovered that the company previously encountered restrictions from the SEC’s “baby shelf rules.” Notably, these regulations limit how much smaller public firms can sell swiftly using a Form S-3 shelf registration statement. This is a common funding method mostly applicable for digital asset treasuries (DAT). According to a statement from the Chief Executive Officer of AlphaTON Capital, Brittany Kaiser, they have achieved a big milestone in overcoming the SEC’s ‘baby-shelf’ limitation on raising funds. This move illustrates the company’s pursuit of a global top position as a major provider of infrastructure for future decentralized AI. “Once this shelf registration is active, we will have more financial flexibility to act swiftly on major opportunities,” Kaiser added. Meanwhile, reports from reliable sources indicate that the Treasury firm has already identified several promising acquisition targets. These targets include startups focusing on payments, sharing content, and blockchain-based services within the Open Network ecosystem. On the other hand, analysts highlighted that the company’s funding will enable it to expand its treasury of TON tokens and other related digital assets. The firm’s decision has prompted other Digital Asset Trusts (DATs) also to consider growing their business through infrastructure services and acquisitions. This move is made at a time when the interest of public cryptocurrency holders appears to be decreasing. AlphaTON’s interest in filing for a meme shelf registration grew when the treasury firm’s mNAV declined in November. At this time, the digital asset treasury firm announced that it had moved most of its assets into Toncoin and established staking positions. It also announced its intention to explore new ways to expand. To demonstrate its commitment to seeking new ways to grow, the firm began by updating its agreement to purchase a 60% stake in the mobile gaming platform GAMEE for $15 million. Regarding its new developments, the company intends to acquire GMEE, valued at up to $4 million, and Watcoin tokens on the open market. Moreover, it plans to launch a co-branded TON Mastercard this December by collaborating with PagoPay and ALT5 Sigma. The crypto industry adopts fast blockchain technology as a new way to expand Cocoon , which refers to Telegram’s Confidential Compute Open Network, is a decentralized platform for artificial intelligence computing. This network was established by Telegram and developed on the TON blockchain. After being introduced just a few days ago, it adopted a strategy of rewarding users in Toncoin for renting out their GPUs to manage user queries. Considering the advantages of this network, AlphaTON shared a statement dated Monday, December 1, highlighting that it has delivered a lot of Nvidia B200 GPUs to Cocoon. This move aims at establishing a new source of revenue for the firm’s business. In the meantime, it is worth noting that after Telegram halted the development of its unique Layer 1 due to legal pressure from the SEC following its $1.7 billion initial coin offering, several community-driven initiatives, such as the Open Network, emerged.

Here’s why,https://timestabloid.com/expert-warns-selling-xrp-at-5-might-be-a-fatal-mistake-heres-why/,"In a recent tweet accompanied by a video, crypto commentator CryptoSensei delivered a major warning to XRP holders. He stated that “Selling XRP at $5 might be a fatal mistake”. The commentator argued that if XRP reaches $5, that level should not be viewed as the ceiling but rather a potential springboard to significantly higher valuations. The message centered on the idea that cashing out at an early, arbitrary target risks forfeiting substantially larger gains if the market continues to climb. SELLING #XRP AT $5 MIGHT BE A FATAL MISTAKE!!! $100+ PRICE TARGET pic.twitter.com/0Tt7PXLxnz — CryptoSensei (@Crypt0Senseii) December 3, 2025 Core claims and reasoning CryptoSensei based the message on a simple idea: if XRP can reach $5, it could continue to move far beyond that point, potentially reaching $50, $100, or even higher. The commentator argued that $5 should not be viewed as a meaningful endpoint and described selling at that level as a mistake for anyone expecting significant long-term growth. The point was presented as a caution rather than investment advice, reflecting the commentator’s belief in XRP’s potential upside. A Technical Analyst’s View A parallel view from the technical-analysis side adds further context to this conversation. Charting Guy, a respected technical analyst on X, recently outlined his price structure for XRP. He traced XRP’s move from its $0.38 low in 2023 and labelled it the start of a multi-wave sequence. His analysis places XRP in a wave 5 extension, with a target near $8. While distinct from CryptoSensei’s more expansive long-term projections, this view still reflects an expectation of higher pricing and reinforces the notion that the asset may have room to grow before any major cycle concludes. In the video, CryptoSensei expanded on two connected points. The first is that price milestones are relative, and $5 does not necessarily represent the asset’s full potential in a market that could expand under the right conditions. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 The second is that taking profits too early can lead to frustration if the price continues to rise afterward. CryptoSensei encouraged holders to carefully consider the cost of exiting at one fixed target and suggested that a more measured approach may be necessary for those who aim to benefit from possible future gains. Reassessing Exit Strategies for Long-Term Goals If the message is taken as intended, it urges XRP holders to reconsider rigid sell targets and to plan exits based on personal goals rather than single price points. The video acknowledged that each investor must decide what is right for their own situation, but it framed selling at $5 as a choice that could lead to later regret if higher prices are eventually reached. The more modest $8 technical target, described by Charting Guy, still requires substantial market activity, emphasizing that any long-term appreciation involves variables that remain uncertain.

In a joint statement, the regulators said, “An in-depth review has been launched to assess the adequacy of existing safeguards for direct and indirect investments in crypto-assets by retail investors.” The committee also said economic and financial conditions in Italy remain broadly favorable, but global uncertainty is still high. The push landed on the same day Europol revealed that it dismantled an international crypto fraud network that laundered more than €700 million across several countries. In an official statement seen by Cryptopolitan, the EU investigators said the case began with one fake website and expanded into a whole operation built on false crypto-investment platforms. Victims were pulled in through ads that promised high returns. After making their first deposits, they were shown fake profits on fake dashboards and pushed to reinvest. Once the money was in, the criminals moved it through several blockchains and crypto exchanges to hide the flow. Europol tracks suspects and seizes funds Europol’s first major action happened on October 27, when police raided sites in Cyprus, Germany , and Spain at the request of French and Belgian authorities. Nine suspects were arrested. Officers seized €800,000 in bank accounts, €415,000 in crypto, €300,000 in cash, and high-end watches, electronics, and documents tied to the scheme. Authorities busting crypto criminals. Credits: Europol Officials said the second phase, carried out on November 25 and 26, targeted marketing firms tied to the network in Germany, Belgium, Bulgaria, and Israel. These firms were accused of running ads that used deepfakes, fake media clips, and fake celebrity endorsements to lure victims. Europol described the case as one of the largest crypto laundering operations in Europe and said, “The investigation revealed that more than €700 million was laundered through a complex network of cryptocurrency exchanges, using digital anonymity to conceal illicit flows of funds.” Officials said the findings show how well-organized fraud groups now run fake platforms that look real enough to fool investors. EU leaders weigh new ESMA powers over crypto firms The European Commission also presented new plans on Thursday to make the EU’s capital markets more competitive by easing cross-border activity and increasing the powers of the European Securities and Markets Authority, known as ESMA. The 27-nation bloc is trying to keep up with the United States and China, and officials said the EU can boost its performance by strengthening its single market for services. Former Italian Prime Minister Enrico Letta, who wrote a report last year on how to fix the single market, said the biggest impact would come from channeling 33 trillion euros in private savings into the real economy. Enrico said that a third of that money is sitting in current accounts. He added that 300 billion euros in family savings flows overseas, mostly to the United States, which he said shows how fragmented EU markets are. He pointed to market values in 2024, when the EU’s market was equal to 73% of GDP, while the U.S. reached 270% of GDP. Under the new plan, oversight of trading venues, central counterparties, CSDs, and crypto-asset providers would move to ESMA, which would also take on a stronger role in coordinating asset management. France, home of ESMA, has pushed for this shift. ESMA head Verena Ross said she would welcome the move. ESMA said the new package “represents a major step towards deeper and more efficient EU capital markets.” The proposal follows the rollout of the EU’s new crypto rules this year, which raised concerns about uneven enforcement. Regulators in France, Italy, and Austria called in September for ESMA to take charge of supervising major crypto firms. France also warned it may challenge the passporting of licenses from countries with softer licensing standards. Malta’s financial regulator, which faced scrutiny this year for its licensing process, said it opposes giving ESMA more crypto supervision power. Want your project in front of crypto’s top minds?

According to the company's statement, the new Layer-1 (L1) mainnet, called Aster Chain, will go live in the first quarter of 2026. This will be followed by ASTER staking, on-chain governance, and smart monitoring tools in the second quarter of 2026. The Aster team also claimed to have completed key milestones throughout 2025, including the completion of the Astherus and ApolloX merger, the launch of the TGE, the launch of the mobile app, multiple CEX listings, and the launch of new products such as Hedge Mode, Trade & Earn, and a buyback program. The team stated that it will move to a new growth model in 2026, which it describes as “three engines feeding each other”: infrastructure, token usage, and community-ecosystem development. Related News: The Key to Bitcoin Lies in Michael Saylor's Hands: Here's What JPMorgan Says Is Needed to Prevent Disaster December 2025 will be a busy month for Aster. In the first days of the month, Shield Mode, which provides privacy for high-leverage trades, and TWAP strategy orders, which aim to reduce slippage through algorithmic price averaging, will be launched. In mid-December, the real-world assets (RWA) upgrade will be launched, strengthening equity futures products with broader asset support and deeper liquidity. At the end of the month, Aster Chain's testnet will be available to the community, allowing for broad testing of the new L1 infrastructure before its public release. In addition to the mainnet launch in the first quarter of 2026, Aster Code, a toolkit that will enable developers to develop applications on Aster more quickly and easily, will be introduced. Furthermore, by offering fiat on-ramp and off-ramp services through third-party providers, users will be able to more easily enter and exit the ecosystem with fiat currencies. In the second quarter of the year, the focus will shift to the token economy. A staking mechanism will be implemented for ASTER holders, allowing users to lock their tokens and earn returns. *This is not investment advice.

That vision is now a reality. Figure, a leading U.S. blockchain lending platform, has just launched a groundbreaking real-world asset consortium on the Solana blockchain. This ambitious initiative aims to shatter the barriers between traditional finance and decentralized finance (DeFi) for everyone. What is This New Real-World Asset Consortium? This consortium is a powerful alliance of key players in the crypto space. Its core mission is to expand access to over $1 billion in monthly on-chain loans . Previously, such institutional-grade returns were locked away for banks and accredited investors. Now, Figure and its partners are building the infrastructure to bring them directly to the general DeFi community. The consortium includes heavyweights like oracle provider Chainlink, decentralized exchange Raydium, and risk management platform Gauntlet. This collaborative approach ensures the ecosystem is robust, secure, and liquid from day one. How Does the Solana Consortium Benefit Everyday Users? So, what’s in it for you? The benefits are transformative. This initiative directly tackles one of DeFi’s biggest hurdles: connecting high-yield, real-world debt to on-chain liquidity. Democratized Access: Earn yields from real-world assets like mortgages and loans, previously an exclusive club. Enhanced Liquidity: Support for the PRIME liquid staking token, built on the Hastra protocol, provides flexible staking options. Institutional-Grade Infrastructure: Partners like Gauntlet and Chainlink bring professional-grade risk management and reliable data. Therefore, you are not just speculating on crypto assets; you are gaining exposure to the steady, income-generating engine of the traditional economy, all with the efficiency of blockchain. What Are the Key Technologies Powering the RWA Vision? The consortium’s success hinges on innovative technology. At its heart is the PRIME liquid staking token and the Hastra liquidity protocol, co-developed with the Provenance Blockchain Foundation. This technology stack is crucial for tokenizing real-world debt and making it tradable. Moreover, integration with platforms like Camino Finance and CASH will streamline how these assets are originated and managed. Privy’s focus on user-friendly onboarding removes another critical barrier. Together, they create a seamless pipeline from the real world to your Solana wallet. What Challenges Does the Real-World Asset Space Face? Despite the excitement, the path forward isn’t without obstacles. Tokenizing physical assets like real estate or loans involves complex legal and regulatory frameworks. Ensuring accurate, real-time data for these off-chain assets is another persistent challenge—a gap that consortium members like Chainlink aim to fill. However, by forming a consortium, Figure and its partners are pooling resources and expertise to navigate these hurdles collectively. This unified front is far stronger than any single company working alone. Conclusion: A New Chapter for Accessible Finance Figure’s real-world asset consortium marks a pivotal step toward a more inclusive financial system. It leverages Solana’s speed and low costs to bridge a trillion-dollar market with the innovation of DeFi. For the first time, the immense value locked in real-world loans and mortgages can work for the everyday investor, unlocking a future where high-quality yields are available to all. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) What is a real-world asset (RWA) in crypto? In crypto, a real-world asset (RWA) is a traditional financial asset, like a real estate loan or treasury bill, that is represented as a token on a blockchain. This allows it to be traded, lent, or borrowed in decentralized finance (DeFi) applications. Why is Solana being used for this consortium? Solana is known for its high transaction speed and very low costs. These features are essential for handling the volume and micro-transactions associated with tokenizing and trading millions of dollars in real-world debt efficiently. What is the PRIME token? PRIME is a liquid staking token developed on the Hastra protocol. It allows users to stake their assets to help secure the network while still having a liquid, tradable token that can be used elsewhere in the DeFi ecosystem. Is investing through this consortium safe? While the consortium includes top-tier partners for security and risk management (like Gauntlet), all DeFi activities carry inherent risk. Users should always conduct their own research, understand the smart contracts involved, and never invest more than they can afford to lose. Who can participate in this RWA ecosystem? The consortium’s stated goal is to make these opportunities available to general DeFi users. In practice, this means anyone with a compatible Solana wallet and access to the supporting platforms (like Raydium) can potentially participate, subject to the rules of each platform. How does this differ from other RWA projects? The key difference is the consortium model. Instead of a single company, a group of specialized leaders is collaborating. This shared approach aims to build a more standardized, interoperable, and robust ecosystem for real-world assets on Solana. Found this insight into the future of finance revolutionary?

WhiteBIT Included In Major Crypto Indices On Thursday, top crypto exchange WhiteBIT announced that its token, WBT, has been added to the S&P Cryptocurrency Broad Digital Market (BDM) Index, curated by S&P Dow Jones Indices (DJI). The S&P BDM Index is designed to track the performance of crypto assets that meet strict institutional criteria, including liquidity, market capitalization, governance, transparency, and risk controls, and are listed on recognized open digital exchanges. This marks an important milestone for both WhiteBIT and the broader fintech landscape in Central and Eastern Europe , the exchange noted, as it reinforces “the platform’s growing role in the global crypto economy” and highlights the industry’s move toward regulated, infrastructure-level players. In a statement, Volodymyr Nosov, CEO of WhiteBIT, affirmed that “being recognized by S&P DJI is more than an index inclusion — it signals that crypto infrastructure from our region has reached global institutional standards.” The announcement also revealed that WBT was added to the other four S&P Dow Jones digital-asset indices, including the S&P Cryptocurrency Broad Digital Asset (BDA) Index, S&P Cryptocurrency Financials Index, S&P Cryptocurrency LargeCap Ex-MegaCap Index, and the S&P Cryptocurrency LargeCap Index. Notably, index providers have been expanding coverage beyond protocol-layer tokens as the industry matures, acknowledging the systemic role of exchanges and financial infrastructure platforms, positioning these companies within the global map of institutional-grade digital asset providers. The exchange underscored that the classifications require a remarkable record of liquidity stability, transparent price formation, and consistent market cap behavior. “This is a turning point not only for our company but also for the evolution of compliant crypto services worldwide,” Nosov continued. WhiteBIT’s Expansion And WBT’s Momentum The S&P index inclusions follow a strong market performance from WBT, which rallied around 50% over the last three months, despite recent market volatility that sent many leading tokens to multi-month lows in the past few weeks. In mid-November, the altcoin reached an all-time high (ATH) of $62.96, fueled by last month’s positive developments. As reported by Bitcoinist, WhiteBIT unveiled its entry into the Argentine and Brazilian markets, building on its expansion to Australia, Croatia, Italy, and Kazakhstan. The move is expected to integrate local fiat providers and add support for local currencies, aiming to further enhance accessibility and convenience for domestic users in the two largest countries in South America. Moreover, the exchange signed a strategic cooperation agreement with Durrah AlFodah Holding, represented by His Royal Highness Prince Naif Bin Abdullah Bin Saud Bin Abdulaziz Al Saud, to drive the Kingdom’s development in blockchain technology, digital finance, and data infrastructure. Under the strategic agreement, WhiteBIT is set to provide technological expertise and infrastructure design. Meanwhile, Durrah AlFodah will facilitate the exchange’s market entry, regulatory engagement, and partnership development across Saudi Arabia. Now, being part of S&P’s indices offers WBT a clear benchmark , the announcement added, facilitating its use in future financial products and long-term investment strategies. This expanded representation marks an important shift for WBT: from a utility token into a component integrated into global benchmark structures used by investment firms, ETF/ETN designers, and quantitative research platforms. Its presence in multiple institutional models means that WBT is now incorporated into the analytical frameworks that guide long-term allocation strategies, diversified exposure construction, and risk-adjusted portfolio modelling. In the late hours of December 3, WBT rallied to a new ATH of $63.05 before stabilizing around the $62 mark, according to CoinGecko data. This represents a 14.5% increase from the recent lows and a 9% surge in the weekly timeframe.",Crypto News|european crypto exchange|S&P BDM Index|S&P Crypto Index|S&P Dow Jones Indices|Volodymyr Nosov|WBT|WBT ATH|WBTUSDT|WhiteBit|WhiteBIT Expansion|WhiteBIT Group,EN,0,0,ALTCOIN|BLOCKCHAIN|EXCHANGE|MARKET|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-12-05 06:00:04

Bitcoin Dynamics Are Currently Looking Similar To Early 2022 Bear Market In its latest weekly report, Glassnode has discussed about how the broader Bitcoin market structure is starting to resemble Q1 2022. First, the analytics firm has shared the data of its Supply Quantiles Cost Basis Model, highlighting price levels that correspond to a certain degree of investor profitability. In the chart, three supply quantiles are listed: 0.75, 0.85, and 0.95. If Bitcoin trades at the first of these levels, 75% of the supply will be in profit. Similarly, the latter two correspond to 85% and 95% profitability, respectively. Related Reading: Ethereum Back At $3,200 As Sharks Show Strong Accumulation It’s visible in the graph that Bitcoin has recently fallen below all three of these levels, indicating more than 25% of the cryptocurrency’s supply is now underwater. “This creates a fragile balance between the risk of top-buyer capitulation and the potential for seller exhaustion to form a bottom,” explained Glassnode. BTC similarly broke below the 0.75 quantile back during the sideways market of early 2022. Another indicator that reinforces the resemblance is the Total Supply in Loss, which measures, as its name suggests, the amount of the Bitcoin circulating supply that’s being held at some net unrealized loss. Below is a chart showing the 7-day moving average (MA) trend in the metric. As displayed in the graph, the 7-day MA Bitcoin Total Supply in Loss hit a high of 7.1 million BTC last week, which is the highest that it has been since September 2023, more than two years ago. The analytics firm noted: The current scale of supply in loss, ranging between 5M–7M BTC, is strikingly similar to the early-2022 sideways market, further reinforcing the resemblance noted above. Finally, the Bitcoin long-term holder Spent Output Profit Ratio (SOPR) also implies that the current market structure is mirroring Q1 2022. This metric tells us, in short, whether the Bitcoin investors holding since more than 155 days ago are selling their coins at a profit or loss. The Bitcoin long-term holder SOPR has witnessed a sharp decline recently, but its value is still above 1, indicating the long-term holders are selling at some net profit. With its current value of 1.43, however, there has been a notable shrinkage in the profit margins of the cohort. Related Reading: Next Key XRP Level Could Be $1.2 If Current Support Fails, Says Analyst It now remains to be seen whether the trends in these indicators mean that the cryptocurrency is on the cusp of a bear market transition like in early 2022, or if a rebound will come before long.

The new player has entered the crypto-pegged asset space, intending to slash the transaction costs that many users have long complained about. This development is part of the firm’s plan to establish a layer-1 blockchain centered on payments. The project is led by Brian Shroder, who previously served as CEO of Binance. US from 2021 until 2023. In January 2025, Shroder and its co-founders secured more than $20 million in seed funding to develop the platform. According to a Thursday announcement, 1Money announced that its eponymous platform will feature “zero platform fees,” charging only usage-based fees for stablecoin and fiat transactions. The company stated that the service will operate on 1Money’s upcoming layer-1 network for stablecoin payments, with no gas fees. This is because it is designed to impose fees depending on transaction usage with stablecoins and fiat currency, according to the company’s statement. To further illustrate its commitment to supporting the development of the crypto industry, 1Money hinted that it will continue to embrace this move on its layer-1 network for stablecoin payments. According to this project, there will be no gas fees. 1Money seeks to put an end to excessive fees in the crypto Industry Following 1Money’s significant move , Brian Shroder, the co-founder and CEO of 1Money, stated that, “For far too long, traditional stablecoin service providers have held back the ecosystem with extremely high monthly minimums and excessive fees. 1Money is putting an end to that.” As a former CEO of Binance.US, Shroder acknowledged that the crypto platform differs from the global cryptocurrency exchange. He noted that he began playing his role at the crypto-pegged assets-focused firm 1Money in 2024, following his departure from Binance.US in September 2023. By January 2025, the company announced $20 million in seed funding. This announcement was released three months after 1Money publicly stated that it had successfully acquired 34 money transmitter licenses, allowing it to operate throughout the US. To remain competitive in the industry, the orchestration platform seeks to broaden its services. Currently, it aims to expand its reach by providing “regulated custody” services for stablecoins and infrastructure. This decision demonstrates a growing trend among fintech companies. According to sources, several fintech firms have made it clear that they intend to explore the stablecoin market. This comes at a time when both the US and the European Union are progressing with crypto-friendly regulations. An example of these firms is payments provider Unlimit, which released a statement on Tuesday, December 2, revealing a new non-custodial platform specifically designed for stablecoins. Moreover, reports indicated that two leading payment firms, Visa and Mastercard , began backing stablecoins in October and November, respectively. In August, Ripple Labs announced plans to offer stablecoins payment services after acquiring Rail for $200 million. In 2024, the Fintech company introduced its own stablecoin known as RLUSD. IMF releases a guideline to ease tension among crypto investors As stablecoins become increasingly popular among individuals, concerns about the risks associated with cryptocurrencies are raising tension in the ecosystem. This situation prompted the International Monetary Fund (IMF) to take the necessary action to ease this tension. In a detailed report , the agency outlined how the expanding crypto-pegged asset market can impact the economy. It also provided suggestions on whether the current global rules are sufficient to handle the risks associated with cryptocurrencies. The title of this report was “Understanding Stablecoins.” During its release this week, the IMF elaborated on how various regions, including the United States, the United Kingdom, Japan, and the European Union, have established regulations for stablecoins. It also indicated that new rules are useful in lowering risks to overall financial stability. However, following the current circumstances, analysts expressed that the situation is “fragmented.” This means that policymakers are applying different approaches, and there are various ways to issue a crypto-pegged asset. “The rise of new stablecoins across multiple blockchains and exchanges creates worries about inefficiencies because they may not work well together,” said the IMF. “Additionally, this can lead to differences and challenges among countries because of varying regulations and transaction obstacles.” Join a premium crypto trading community free for 30 days - normally $100/mo.",News|Binance,EN,0,0,EXCHANGE|FIAT|MARKET|BNB|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-12-05 06:04:11

CZ shared his thoughts on the United States market during a private press conference at Binance Blockchain Week, which took place at the Coca Cola Arena in Dubai Dec. 3-4. When asked by a member of the media about his involvement in the US following President Trump’s pardon , CZ explained that he is “very appreciative of the pardon from Trump,” noting that this allows Binance to conduct business more “freely” in every part of the world – America included. “It’s my full intention to help make America the capital of crypto,” CZ stated. “Also, America is an emerging land for Binance. For the last few years we have been dealing with the Biden administration so much that we have tried to withdraw from the US as much as possible. We didn’t invest in the US and we tried to pull out.

He explained that in 2023 the SEC sued Binance US , causing the business to lose all banking access and a few state licenses. However, CZ now views the US as “a very important market” and a leading region in terms of tech talent. However, he believes that leaders in the blockchain industry still reside outside of the United States. “Large businesses like Binance and a few other large players are not technically in the US, so I do want to help bring many of those businesses back into the region,” he said “Also, many institutional investors do not have access or exposure to BNB, so we want to help with that.” CZ speaks at private press conference alongside Nina Rong, BNB Director of Growth. Source: Rachel Wolfson, Cryptonews Reporter CZ Says US Has Clear Crypto Regulations Cryptonews further asked CZ about challenges holding back crypto adoption globally and how Binance aims to combat this moving forward. CZ mentioned that first and foremost regulatory frameworks have to become clarified in many parts of the world. To enable this, he explained his involvement with more than a dozen different countries on ways to develop and implement regulations. CZ added that currently only a handful of countries have clear regulations around digital assets, yet pointed out that the US is leading the way. “Now the US is leading – which is good, but the US is only just starting. Trump has only been in power for a year,” he stated. CZ further remarked that progress has been made with the recent passing of the GENIUS Act, which establishes clear rules around stablecoins . He added that the CLARITY Act, which aims to define digital assets, remains a work in progress. “Also the first draft of regulations will not be perfect – it takes time to evolve. After this, the banks will need to work closely with crypto businesses. We need to integrate with existing financial systems to enable mainstream adoption, as that’s the best way for growth,” CZ remarked. CZ Speaks Out About Prison Time In addition to sharing his thoughts on the importance of the US market for crypto expansion, CZ described his time in prison.

While the entire network stands to benefit, one Layer 2 project is uniquely positioned to harness its full potential. Analysis reveals that Taiko is set to be the biggest beneficiary of the Fusaka upgrade , a development that could reshape transaction efficiency on Ethereum. What Makes the Fusaka Upgrade So Crucial for Taiko? The Fusaka upgrade introduces two pivotal enhancements: improved data availability and a mechanism to pre-confirm future block proposers via EIP-7917. For Layer 2 solutions like Taiko, this is transformative. Enhanced data availability means rollups can process more information reliably and cheaply. However, the real game-changer for Taiko is the pre-confirmation capability. This directly enables Taiko to implement its proprietary Preconfirmation technology. In simple terms, this technology allows users to receive faster and more certain guarantees that their transactions will be included in the next block. Therefore, the upgrade removes a layer of uncertainty that has historically plagued rollup users. How Will Taiko Leverage This Technology? Taiko’s leadership has been preparing for this moment. Taiko COO Joaquin Mendes provided key insights into their strategy. He explained that while PeerDAS—a core feature of Fusaka—provides high-performance data availability, accessing it reliably requires specific configurations. Supernode Configuration: Rollups need a supernode-level beacon client to reliably access data blobs. Mendes confirmed Taiko is prepared to implement this. Preconfirmation Advantage: By integrating EIP-7917, Taiko can offer users near-instant finality, a massive improvement over current wait times. Competitive Edge: This technical readiness positions Taiko ahead of other rollups in capitalizing on Fusaka’s benefits immediately. Consequently, users can expect a dramatically improved experience with faster withdrawals and more predictable transaction outcomes. What Are the Broader Implications for Ethereum? The success of one Layer 2 project elevates the entire ecosystem. When Taiko thrives as the biggest beneficiary of the Fusaka upgrade , it creates a powerful proof-of-concept. It demonstrates how targeted protocol improvements can unlock specific, high-impact use cases. Moreover, it encourages further innovation across other scaling solutions. This upgrade is a clear signal that Ethereum’s development roadmap is increasingly aligned with the practical needs of its Layer 2 ecosystem. The focus on data availability and pre-confirmations addresses two of the most pressing bottlenecks for rollup scalability and user experience. Conclusion: A New Chapter for Scalability The Fusaka upgrade is more than a technical update; it’s a catalyst for a new phase of Ethereum scaling. Taiko’s foresight in developing Preconfirmation technology and its readiness for the required infrastructure changes place it at the forefront of this shift. As the network evolves, projects that can seamlessly integrate these advancements will lead the charge in making blockchain technology faster, cheaper, and more reliable for everyone. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) What is the Ethereum Fusaka upgrade? The Fusaka upgrade is a planned Ethereum network improvement focused on enhancing data availability for Layer 2 rollups and introducing a pre-confirmation mechanism for future block proposers via EIP-7917. Why is Taiko the biggest beneficiary? Taiko has developed proprietary Preconfirmation technology that directly utilizes the new capabilities Fusaka introduces, particularly EIP-7917, allowing it to offer significantly faster and more certain transaction finality before other competitors. What is Preconfirmation technology? Preconfirmation technology allows a user to get a guarantee that their transaction will be included in an upcoming block, providing faster finality and reducing uncertainty compared to standard rollup transactions. What is PeerDAS? PeerDAS (Peer Data Availability Sampling) is a core component of the Fusaka upgrade designed to provide high-performance, scalable data availability, which is essential for the cost-effective operation of Layer 2 rollups. When will the Fusaka upgrade happen? The exact timeline for the Fusaka upgrade is determined by the Ethereum core developer community. It follows the successful implementation of previous upgrades like Dencun, with testnet deployments preceding a mainnet launch. How will this affect ordinary users? End-users on Taiko and similar rollups should experience faster transaction finality, more predictable costs, and an overall smoother experience when the upgrade is live and integrated.

On 28 November, the Peoples Bank of China (PBOC) held a multi-agency meeting to address a fresh rise in virtual currency activity. China’s top financial, judicial and cybersecurity bodies reaffirmed that all crypto related activity is illegal. The most significant shift is the singling out stablecoins. Officials warned that they fall short of basic requirements for customer identification and anti-money laundering safeguards. Stablecoins such as Tether (USDT) and Circle’s USDC were specifically mentioned and may be central to upcoming investigations. Tether makes up the overwhelming majority of traded tokens since the 2021 blanket crypto ban, said Roger Huang, author of Would Mao Hold Bitcoin. “Traders gravitate toward Tether because its spreads are relatively low and it supports a broad set of trading pairs. When a token isn’t listed on major exchanges like Huobi or Binance, they can simply transfer their Tether to smaller exchanges that do list it.” Underground crypto persists despite ban Numerous reports indicate that cryptocurrency trading activity in mainland China has increased this year. At the meeting, officials discussed stepping up coordination, improving information sharing, strengthening regulatory frameworks and law enforcement. Roger Huang said that crypto fundraising currently operates under a “don’t ask, don’t tell” principle. While warnings from the Communist Party create significant waves among institutional investors, they function as a form of “social self-censorship” for everyday people. He said for many Chinese investors crypto is a logical alternative to the current housing and stock market. “China is experiencing a period of deflation. Youth unemployment is extremely high, at roughly 20 percent. Housing prices, especially in major tier one cities, have seen significant declines and traditional options like equities have brought about losses.” Against the backdrop of discouragement, crypto enthusiasts and crypto investors will look for ways around it, said Bonnie Girard, President of China Channel LLC, a business consultancy firm in China. She said while China’s crypto warnings are broadly respected, the country’s cultural penchant for gambling influences some people to take the risk anyway. “Individuals will run a risk and reward calculation for themselves and proceed accordingly,” she said. “Many still choose to bypass restrictions using tools like VPNs even though they are banned.” Girard believes adherence to the crypto ban will likely tighten “as more people see stories of heavy losses or criminal convictions.” The end of China’s crypto ambiguity China is eager to quash the idea of private stablecoins as the token gains momentum in Japan, Hong Kong, Singapore, South Korea and Taiwan. Professor Eric Lee from UNSW Sydney Business School told Cryptopolitan that in China digital assets pose a threat in the way it could enable capital flows to evade monitoring and oversight. For a government that wants full authority over monetary policy, stablecoins are a structural problem because they give away that control,” he said. “Privately issued stablecoins or crypto currencies operate on decentralized blockchain that can’t be policed in the same way as traditional finance.” Lee said the warning leaves no room for people to feign ignorance. ”These comments serve as a warning for anyone harboring thoughts of experimenting with digital assets,” he said. Bonnie Girard, President of China Channel LLC, a business consultancy firm, said Chinese policy towards digital assets can be understood from a standpoint of whether it bolsters Communist Party control or not. “The impact on the Party is paramount,” she said. “Beijing views social and financial stability as essential to preventing challenges to its rule.” She said an ideological divide explains why stablecoins and cryptocurrencies are seen as domains of the state while the U.S. sees them as technologies to be supervised rather than suppressed. China accelerates CBDC while squeezing out crypto China is pushing for complete control of its digital monetary system through the digital yuan. In 2020 it rolled out an e-yuan, commonly referred to as e-CNY, that’s already being used for supermarket shopping, state welfare payouts, corporate settlements and salary payments. After a decade of research and pilot projects the e-CNY has advanced to a national level where it now processes trillions of yuan in transactions. The token is intended to replace notes and coins rather than bank deposits. The digital currency is slated to replace the widely popular Alipay and WeChat pay. The project is also giving the government unprecedented visibility into how money moves through the world’s second largest economy. While the geopolitical narrative often casts China and the United States as rivals locked in a contest for monetary power, Lee said Beijing’s motivations may be far more prosaic. Lee said the gold backed e-CNY is a practical trade tool helping sustain China’s high export volumes. “They prefer their global trading partners to use and hold digital CNY for trade because it helps China continue to fuel their trade surplus and boost global demand for their exports to achieve their GDP target,” he said. Lee believes people overestimate how much China cares about challenging the dominance of USD.

Traders are watching the Federal Reserve’s December actions closely as they try to gauge how much liquidity will return to markets. The move pushed bitcoin back within reach of a roughly $2 trillion market cap. Sovereign Funds Building Longer Positions According to BlackRock chief executive Larry Fink, several sovereign wealth funds have been quietly adding to positions as prices fell from a peak near $126,000. “There are a number of sovereign funds that are standing by…. and they’re buying ‘incrementally’ as the Bitcoin price has retreated from its $126,000 peak,” Fink said. He said these buyers are taking a gradual approach — adding over time rather than making quick bets — and treating holdings as multi-year positions. Reports have disclosed that public funds in Abu Dhabi and Luxembourg have bought into BlackRock’s IBIT bitcoin fund in recent months. Fink warned that markets remain skewed and that volatility will persist while many players remain highly leveraged. Tokenization Seen As A Long-Term Story Fink has been vocal about tokenization as a major theme for the coming years. Based on reports, he wrote in The Economist that tokenization could grow as quickly as the internet did in its early days, noting that Amazon had only $16 million in sales in 1996. BlackRock , the $10 trillion asset manager he runs, has pushed the idea that a digital wallet could one day hold stocks, bonds and tokenized assets together. Coinbase chief executive Brian Armstrong said some of the largest banks are already working with Coinbase on stablecoins, custody and trading services, though he did not name the banks. On Ownership & Worry According to remarks made at a DealBook event alongside Andrew Ross Sorkin and Brian Armstrong, Fink described bitcoin in emotional terms: ownership often reflects worries about physical safety or financial security. He tied demand to concerns over the debasement of financial assets and rising deficits. Reports have also quoted him warning that the US risks falling behind other governments if it does not speed up adoption of tokenization and other digital tools. US President Donald Trump has similarly warned about competition from China in crypto innovation. Market Reaction And Risks Ahead Traders are already pricing in a variety of scenarios. Some are betting on a major development in 2026 that could reshape demand; others remain focused on short-term policy moves from the Fed . Bitcoin’s recent 8% gain was the largest daily jump since May, but it came after sharp swings that highlighted how quickly positions can reverse. With significant capital now involved — and big names publicly backing tokenization — the market is likely to see more headline-driven moves.

A recent FINRA survey delivers a sobering revelation about shifting crypto purchase intent across the United States. While crypto ownership remains steady, the willingness to buy more appears to be fading. Let’s explore what this means for the market. What Does the FINRA Survey Reveal About Crypto Purchase Intent? The Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA) conducted extensive research between July and December 2024, surveying 2,861 U.S. investors and 25,539 adults. Their findings paint a clear picture: while 27% of investors still hold cryptocurrency, their enthusiasm for additional purchases has cooled significantly. Specifically, the percentage of investors considering new or additional crypto purchases dropped from 33% in 2021 to just 26% in 2024. This 7-point decline represents a meaningful shift in investor psychology that could influence market dynamics for months to come. Why Are Investors Hesitant About Crypto Purchases? FINRA analysts point to several economic factors driving this change in crypto purchase intent . The current financial landscape presents multiple challenges that make investors more cautious: High interest rates making traditional investments more attractive Persistent inflation eroding disposable income Economic uncertainty creating risk aversion Preference for safe-haven assets during volatile periods These conditions have created what some analysts call a “flight to safety” mentality, where investors prioritize stability over potential high returns from volatile assets like cryptocurrency. How Has Institutional Investor Behavior Changed? The survey reveals an especially notable trend among institutional investors with high-risk appetites. Their participation in cryptocurrency markets fell from 12% in 2021 to just 8% in 2024. This 33% decline among sophisticated investors suggests deeper concerns about market conditions. Institutional investors typically conduct thorough due diligence before entering markets. Their reduced crypto purchase intent may signal concerns about regulatory clarity, market maturity, or valuation metrics that retail investors might overlook. What Does Steady Crypto Ownership Mean for the Market? Interestingly, while purchase intent has declined, actual cryptocurrency ownership has remained stable at 27% since 2021. This creates a fascinating market dynamic: Existing holders aren’t selling – they’re simply not buying more Market maturation may be occurring as speculative fever cools Long-term adoption continues despite short-term hesitation This stability suggests cryptocurrency has established a permanent place in many investment portfolios, even if current conditions make investors hesitant to increase their exposure. What Actionable Insights Can Investors Take? For investors monitoring their crypto purchase intent , several strategies emerge from the FINRA data: Dollar-cost average during periods of low market enthusiasm Rebalance portfolios to match current risk tolerance Monitor regulatory developments that could impact future valuations Consider long-term horizons rather than short-term speculation Remember, market sentiment often moves in cycles. Today’s hesitation could create tomorrow’s opportunity for disciplined investors. Conclusion: Navigating Shifting Crypto Purchase Intent The FINRA survey provides valuable insight into evolving investor psychology. While declining crypto purchase intent reflects current economic realities, steady ownership levels suggest cryptocurrency remains a legitimate asset class. The key takeaway? Market participation is becoming more deliberate and less speculative as investors respond to macroeconomic conditions. As always, individual investment decisions should align with personal financial goals, risk tolerance, and time horizons rather than following crowd psychology in either direction. Frequently Asked Questions What percentage of US investors own cryptocurrency according to the FINRA survey? According to the FINRA survey, 27% of U.S. investors owned cryptocurrency in both 2021 and 2024, showing stable ownership despite changing purchase intentions. How much did crypto purchase intent decline among US investors? Crypto purchase intent declined from 33% of investors considering purchases in 2021 to 26% in 2024, representing a 7 percentage point drop. Why are institutional investors reducing their crypto participation? Institutional investors with high-risk appetites reduced their crypto participation from 12% to 8%, likely due to economic uncertainty, regulatory concerns, and attractive alternative investments in the current high-interest rate environment. How many people did FINRA survey for this research? FINRA surveyed 2,861 U.S. investors and 25,539 adults between July and December 2024 to gather data for this comprehensive report on investor behavior. Should I change my investment strategy based on this survey? While market surveys provide useful context, investment decisions should primarily align with your personal financial goals, risk tolerance, and investment timeline rather than following general market sentiment. Does declining purchase intent mean cryptocurrency is failing? Not necessarily. Stable ownership percentages suggest cryptocurrency has established itself as a legitimate asset class. Declining purchase intent may reflect temporary economic conditions rather than long-term rejection of the technology. Found this analysis helpful?

South Korea’s leading exchange, Upbit, has officially begun the process of restoring a core function: crypto deposits and withdrawals . This crucial service resumption follows a scheduled wallet system maintenance, marking a significant step towards full operational normalcy. For users eager to move their digital assets, understanding the phased rollout and new security requirements is paramount. What Does Upbit’s Service Resumption Mean for You? Starting at 8:00 a.m. UTC, Upbit initiated a sequential restoration of its deposit and withdrawal services. However, this is not an immediate, all-at-once reactivation. The exchange is prioritizing stability and security, which means services are being restored network by network. This measured approach ensures that each blockchain’s integration is confirmed to be stable before users can transact, minimizing risk for everyone involved. Which Cryptocurrencies Are Live for Upbit Crypto Deposits and Withdrawals? The first wave of restored services includes a specific list of digital assets. If you hold any of the following, you can now generate a new deposit address and begin moving your funds. The initial list confirmed by Upbit includes: ELF, ALGO, ASTR, FIL, FLOW HBD, HIVE, IOST, DON, IOTA EGLD, GAS, NEO, CKB, MBL ONT, ONG, POLYX, STX, STEEM SBD, SWELL, XTZ, A, BLACK CHL, EOSDAC, HORUS, MEETONE, VET, VTHO, WAXP This phased restart for Upbit crypto deposits and withdrawals allows the exchange to monitor system performance closely. Expect announcements for additional assets in the coming days as more networks pass stability checks. A Critical Security Step: You Must Generate a New Deposit Address Here is the most important action item for all users. Upbit has announced that all previous deposit addresses have been deleted. This is a standard and critical security practice following major system maintenance. Therefore, you must generate a brand-new deposit address within your Upbit wallet before attempting to receive any funds . Sending crypto to an old, deleted address will likely result in a permanent loss of funds. How Can You Ensure a Smooth Transaction Experience? To navigate this resumption smoothly, follow these actionable steps. First, log into your Upbit account and navigate to the wallet section for an asset on the live list. Second, generate a new deposit address for that specific cryptocurrency. Third, always send a small test transaction before moving larger amounts, especially when using a new address. This simple verification can prevent costly errors. Why This Careful Restart Builds Long-Term Trust While waiting for services to resume can be frustrating, this meticulous process underscores Upbit’s commitment to security—a cornerstone of the EEAT (Experience, Expertise, Authoritativeness, Trustworthiness) framework that users and search engines value. By prioritizing network stability and enforcing new address generation, the exchange is proactively protecting user assets. This builds greater institutional trust, which is vital for the broader adoption of cryptocurrency exchanges. In conclusion, the sequential restart of Upbit crypto deposits and withdrawals is a positive development executed with necessary caution. Users of the listed assets can now transact, but must remember the non-negotiable step of generating new deposit addresses. As the exchange continues to bring more networks online, this incident highlights the importance of robust security protocols in the dynamic world of digital asset trading. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) When did Upbit resume deposits and withdrawals? Upbit began sequentially resuming services at 8:00 a.m. UTC on the announced date, starting with assets on confirmed stable networks. Can I use my old Upbit deposit address? No. Upbit has deleted all previous deposit addresses. You must generate a completely new address within your wallet before making any deposit to avoid losing your funds. My cryptocurrency isn’t on the initial list. What should I do? Be patient. Upbit is restoring services in phases based on network stability checks. Monitor official Upbit announcements for updates on when your asset’s services will resume. Is it safe to withdraw my crypto from Upbit now? For the cryptocurrencies on the published list, yes, the withdrawal service has been restored following stability confirmation. However, as with any transaction, conducting a small test first is always a prudent practice. Why is Upbit doing this sequentially? The sequential restart allows Upbit to monitor each blockchain integration for stability and security issues individually, ensuring a safer and more reliable experience for all users. What if I sent crypto to my old address? Funds sent to a deleted deposit address are likely unrecoverable. This is why generating and using a new address is absolutely critical. Contact Upbit support immediately if this occurs, but recovery is not guaranteed. Found this guide on the resumption of Upbit crypto deposits and withdrawals helpful?

Key Takeaways: Meta is cutting metaverse spending as it shifts focus to AI-powered wearables. VR platforms like Horizon Worlds have stalled, while smart glasses are gaining traction. The pivot aligns with a broader industry move toward lightweight, AI-integrated devices. The shift comes as investor skepticism grows over the long-term commercial viability of virtual worlds and VR headsets, the BBC reported on Friday , citing a company spokesperson. Meta’s Metaverse Bet Falters as User Growth Stalls The company has spent more than a decade pouring billions into the metaverse, an initiative that was central to CEO Mark Zuckerberg’s vision for the future of computing. That ambition also led Facebook to rebrand as Meta in 2021, signaling a company-wide commitment to building immersive digital spaces. However, momentum has stalled. Meta’s flagship VR platform, Horizon Worlds, has struggled to retain users, while sales of the company’s headsets have failed to justify the scale of investment. Bloomberg reported Thursday that Meta plans to cut metaverse spending by up to 30%, sending shares up more than 3% as markets reacted positively to a potential recalibration. A spokesperson said the company is not planning “broader changes,” declining to comment on whether the shift could include layoffs across metaverse-focused teams. Mark Zuckerberg and Meta Platforms $META are reportedly expected to meaningfully cut resources for building the metaverse Executives have reportedly discussed potential budget cuts as high as 30% for the metaverse group next year – Bloomberg pic.twitter.com/PAuEYuMnhN — Evan (@StockMKTNewz) December 4, 2025 Instead, Meta sees a faster path forward in wearable AI devices, particularly its new line of smart glasses, launched in September to stronger-than-expected demand. The latest models feature an on-lens display capable of describing real-world surroundings, identifying objects, and translating text. Analysts view the glasses as one of the first products to successfully blend AI assistance with hardware in a consumer-friendly form, a direction Meta now hopes to accelerate. The move reflects wider industry trends. Companies across the US and China are racing to bring AI-enabled glasses and compact wearables to market, betting that users will gravitate toward lightweight, always-on assistance rather than immersive VR environments. Meta Shareholders Reject Call to Add Bitcoin to Company Treasury In June, Meta investors overwhelmingly shot down a proposal urging the company to explore adding Bitcoin to its balance sheet, according to a May 28 filing. The measure received just 3.92 million votes in favor, roughly 0.08% of all shares, while nearly 5 billion voted against it. With CEO Mark Zuckerberg controlling 61% of voting power, the outcome was effectively predetermined. The proposal came from Bitcoin advocate Ethan Peck, who argued Meta should allocate part of its $72 billion cash pile into BTC as a hedge against inflation and diminishing real returns on cash and bonds. Peck cited BlackRock’s guidance supporting a small Bitcoin allocation and submitted the proposal on behalf of his family’s Meta holdings. He serves as Bitcoin director at Strive and has pushed similar campaigns at other tech giants.

He added that BTC will mirror the performance of the S&P 500 US stock index next year and predicted a price high of $300,000. If that’s the case, “I think Ethereum is lights out,” he said before adding a more outlandish price prediction. “In the next year it [ETH] could be over $20,000.” Tom Lee at Binance Blockchain Week: 2026 Outlook – S&P breakout – Bitcoin $300k – Ethereum $20k Supercycle is loading.. $BTC $ETH $BMNR pic.twitter.com/KGVvDZrnve — SamAlτcoin.eth (@SAMALTCOIN_ETH) December 4, 2025 The Bigger The Base, The Bigger The Breakout Lee also reiterated the notion that Wall Street is starting to tokenize securities, and most of this is being done on Ethereum. The network currently has more than 70% market share of real-world asset tokenization value when layer-2s and EVM platforms are included, according to RWA.xyz. He also pointed out that Ether has been rangebound for five years, but it has begun to break out. The bigger the base, the bigger the breakout, he said, explaining why he turned BitMine into an ETH treasury company. “I think Ethereum is going to become the future of finance, the payment rails of the future, and if it gets to 0.25 relative to Bitcoin, that’s $62,000. Ethereum at $3,000 is grossly undervalued.” Tom Lee says the setup for Ethereum is simple: “The bigger the base, the bigger the breakout” ETH spent years building the same kind of base it had before the move from $90 → $4,866 If the pattern repeats, the next leg could be far larger than people expect (Shared at… pic.twitter.com/aMBWwLyZ0J — Tom Lee Tracker (Not actually Tom) (@TomLeeTracker) December 4, 2025 BitMine is putting its money where its mouth is with another Ether purchase, bringing the number of buys to four this week alone, according to Lookonchain on Friday. The firm scooped another 41,946 ETH worth $131 million on Thursday, it reported. Although the buys have not been officially confirmed, BitMine appears to have purchased more than $350 million worth of the asset this week. Is ETH Ready For a Pump? Analyst ‘Sykodelic’ echoed the bullish sentiment, stating on Thursday that “ETH looks ready to push much higher.” “In the last five years, every single time the 1-day RSI has gone from overbought down to oversold, and then broken the trend, it has pumped a minimum of 45%. That takes us to $4,300.” Ether was trading at $3,170 during the Friday morning Asian session after failing to break resistance at $3,200 yesterday.

The country’s top economic bodies have launched a comprehensive review of crypto investor protection measures. This move signals a crucial shift as digital currencies become deeply intertwined with the traditional financial system. Why Is Italy Focusing on Crypto Investor Protection Now? The urgency stems from rapid growth. Cryptocurrencies are no longer a niche market. They are increasingly connected to banks, investment funds, and insurance products. Therefore, the Macroeconomic Policy Committee, which includes the Bank of Italy and the Ministry of Finance, states the need for safeguards has escalated. They aim to prevent retail investors from facing undue risks in a volatile and complex market. What Does This Review Mean for Retail Investors? For the average person buying crypto, this review could lead to stronger safety nets. The committee’s work will likely examine several key areas. For instance, they may look at: Clearer Disclosure Rules: Ensuring platforms explain risks in simple language. Advertising Standards: Preventing misleading promotions that overpromise returns. Platform Accountability: Holding exchanges to higher operational standards. Dispute Resolution: Creating clearer paths for investors to resolve issues. This focus on crypto investor protection aligns with broader European efforts under the Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA) regulation. However, Italy is proactively assessing if additional, national-level measures are required. How Will Stronger Protection Impact the Crypto Market? Enhanced safeguards present a double-edged sword. On one hand, they build trust. When investors feel protected, more may participate, potentially boosting market stability and legitimacy. On the other hand, stricter rules could increase compliance costs for service providers. These costs might be passed on to users. Ultimately, the goal is a sustainable ecosystem where innovation thrives alongside consumer safety. What Can Investors Do in the Meantime? While authorities refine regulations, investors are not powerless. You can take proactive steps to protect yourself. First, conduct thorough research before using any platform. Second, diversify your investments to manage risk. Third, never invest more than you can afford to lose. Finally, use secure wallets and enable two-factor authentication. Remember, robust crypto investor protection starts with personal diligence. In conclusion, Italy’s review is a significant step toward a safer digital asset landscape. It acknowledges that with greater adoption comes greater responsibility. By prioritizing crypto investor protection , Italy is not just reacting to trends but helping to shape a more resilient financial future. This proactive stance may well become a blueprint for other nations navigating the same challenges. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: Who is conducting the review of crypto investor protection in Italy? A1: The review is led by Italy’s Macroeconomic Policy Committee, which includes the Bank of Italy, the insurance and pension regulator (IVASS), and the Ministry of Finance. Q2: What triggered this review now? A2: The main trigger is the increasing interconnection between cryptocurrencies and the traditional financial system, which raises new risks for retail investors that existing rules may not fully cover. Q3: Will this stop Italians from buying cryptocurrencies? A3: No. The goal is not to ban crypto but to create a safer environment for buying, selling, and holding digital assets. Think of it as adding safety features, not closing the road. Q4: How does this relate to the EU’s MiCA regulation? A4: MiCA provides a harmonized framework across Europe. Italy’s review likely examines if additional, nation-specific crypto investor protection rules are needed to complement MiCA’s baseline. Q5: When will we know the outcome of this review? A5: Official timelines are not yet public. Such regulatory reviews often take several months before proposals are drafted and opened for public consultation. Q6: What’s the biggest benefit of stronger crypto investor protection? A6: The biggest benefit is increased market confidence. When people trust that they have recourse and that platforms operate fairly, it encourages responsible participation and long-term growth.

Vanguard’s reversal on crypto stance highlights growing investor demand and expansion of the crypto distribution channel, but it doesn’t necessarily imply stronger price performance for underlying crypto assets. Ethereum’s Fusaka upgrade boosts both L1 and L2 performance and signals a shift back toward L1 scaling as a way to improve network throughput and strengthen ETH’s long-term value capture. Bank of America Recommends 1%–4% Crypto Allocation for Portfolios Bank of America is rolling out its first formal crypto-allocation guidance, recommending that Merrill, Private Bank, and Merrill Edge clients consider putting 1–4% of their portfolios into digital assets. It’s a notable shift, considering investment advisers weren’t allowed to bring up crypto with clients unless asked, a rule that effectively sidelined more than 15,000 advisers during a period of rising demand. Beginning January 5, 2026, the CIO group will also start covering a handful of spot bitcoin ETFs, including offerings from BlackRock, Fidelity, Bitwise, and Grayscale. Private Bank CIO Chris Hyzy said a small allocation might be appropriate for clients comfortable with volatility, adding that the bank is sticking to regulated products and diversified approaches. With this move, BoA is falling in line with other big firms that have already put numbers around crypto exposure. Morgan Stanley issued a 2–4% recommendation for ""opportunistic portfolios"" in October, while BlackRock has often argued for a 1–2% bitcoin allocation. Fidelity has long maintained a 2–5% crypto range, with higher bands for younger investors. Key Take Most individual investors still hold no Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) or crypto at all. A recent study estimates global crypto ownership at around 9.9% of internet users, which basically means the majority of people, close to 90%, have zero exposure. We’re likely to see more banks opening up their wealth-management channels to crypto, and this area is shaping up to be one of the last major hurdles in U.S. digital-asset distribution. These advisers collectively oversee about $30 trillion, so even something as small as a 2% bitcoin allocation through that pipeline could mean roughly $600 billion of potential inflows. Compared with traders on exchanges or brokerage ETF buyers, who tend to trade around short-term swings, wealth-management clients usually take a portfolio-level approach. When they add bitcoin, it’s often a longer-term, more stable position, which makes this type of flow quite different, and arguably more impactful, than typical retail trading. Vanguard Opens the Door to Crypto ETFs and Mutual Funds Vanguard is set to open its brokerage platform to crypto ETFs and mutual funds, a move that stands in sharp contrast to its prior position. Back in early 2024, the firm stood firm on not allowing clients to trade the newly approved spot Bitcoin ETFs and went so far as to remove access to Bitcoin futures products. That made Vanguard an outlier among major asset managers. Vanguard is the world’s second-largest asset manager, managing more than $11 trillion in assets and serving over 50 million investors across retail, retirement, and institutional accounts. This move marks one of the most significant mainstream distribution expansions for crypto products to date. According to the company, it will allow most crypto ETFs and mutual funds that meet SEC requirements, treating them much like other niche sectors such as gold funds. Products tied to memecoins or anything outside the regulatory framework will stay off the platform. Vanguard also made clear that it doesn’t plan to launch its own crypto products anytime soon. Key Take Vanguard’s change in attitude looks largely tied to the steady demand for crypto ETFs from both retail and institutional investors. Even with the recent market pullback, ETF products like BlackRock’s IBIT have generated strong revenue for the issuer, and has effectively become one of BlackRock's most profitable product lines. This marks another milestone for the expansion of crypto product distribution channel, and can greatly help to draw in more TradFi investors. That said, it doesn’t automatically translate into price gains for Bitcoin or other crypto assets that have ETF exposure. As we’ve discussed in prior analysis articles, ETF investors tend to be reactive to shifts in market sentiment. They usually buy when the mood in the crypto market is upbeat, but they’re just as quick to sell once sentiment turns negative. Ethereum’s “Fusaka” Upgrade Goes Live Ethereum’s ( ETH-USD ) latest network upgrade, Fusaka, is now live on mainnet. The update rolls out a batch of changes across both the execution and consensus layers, mainly aimed at helping the chain keep up with the growing amount of data coming in from layer-2 networks. The centerpiece of the upgrade is PeerDAS (EIP-7594), a new data-availability system that lets nodes verify only small slices of large blob datasets instead of downloading every byte. By sampling segments rather than pulling entire blobs, validators face far lower bandwidth and storage requirements, making data posting cheaper for rollups and allowing them to scale more comfortably. Fusaka also includes a major increase to Ethereum’s block gas limit, raising the default gas limit from 36 million to 60 million units. This expansion gives the base layer far more room to process transactions and smart-contract activity, easing congestion and improving overall throughput. Key Take This upgrade benefits both Layer-2 scaling networks and Ethereum’s base layer itself. It reflects a gradual shift in Ethereum’s development this year, where the focus is no longer solely on L2-centric improvements but also on strengthening L1 scalability. ETH as an asset has struggled with an unclear value-accrual model in recent years. Under a Layer-2–centric roadmap, much of the transaction activity has been offloaded to Layer 2 networks, leaving the Ethereum base layer with limited fee capture. As a result, ETH has moved from being a deflationary asset back into inflationary territory, due to the base layer’s insufficient fee revenue capture. Fusaka marks a strategic shift in Ethereum’s roadmap toward scaling both L1 and L2, reinforcing the push to make the network a meaningful value generator for ETH holders, especially as increased L1 throughput directs far more economic value to the token than L2 activity. Weekly Market Chart: Crypto Allocation in Portfolio Global banks have increasingly warmed to cryptocurrency exposure in client portfolios, particularly via regulated vehicles like Bitcoin ETFs, as institutional adoption grows in 2025. Recommendations vary by bank, risk tolerance, and client type, but most suggest modest allocations (typically 1-5%) to balance potential upside with volatility. These giant traditional finance institutions often frame bitcoin exposure as a modern alternative asset class akin to ""digital gold"" that offers potential diversification benefits, inflation hedging, and exposure to technological innovation.

The filing specifies that the company will buy and hold XRP and Bitcoin as long-term strategic assets. This allocation is presented as a financial decision intended to diversify the company’s balance sheet and to pursue potential appreciation in asset value over extended time horizons. The filing further indicates that staking income is an anticipated source of stable returns and that staking will form part of the company’s asset-management approach. Operational expansion into crypto and Web3 Beyond treasury management, the PDF outlines a broader corporate transition into crypto operations. AltPlus plans to expand activities related to digital assets and to explore Web3 integrations across its gaming and intellectual property ecosystem. These plans suggest the company intends not only to hold digital assets but also to develop operational capabilities that leverage blockchain technology for product development and platform features within its existing business lines. Financial and governance implications Treating digital assets as part of treasury reserves creates implications for financial reporting, risk management, and corporate governance. The filing indicates an intent to strengthen the company’s balance sheet through these holdings, while also signaling that AltPlus is preparing to manage the attendant operational and compliance requirements. Appropriate custody solutions, valuation methodologies, and internal controls will be necessary to support the shift. The filing’s inclusion of XRP alongside Bitcoin underscores a deliberate diversification strategy rather than a single-asset bet.

Consob, the country’s securities regulator, urged both investors and operators to pay “maximum attention” as the transition period for the EU’s Markets in Crypto-Assets regulation nears its end. The rules will reshape how virtual asset service providers operate across the bloc and how they market trading, custody and other services to retail clients. Under the Italian framework, firms currently acting as Virtual Asset Service Providers, or VASPs, can continue to operate only until Dec. 30, 2025, while they are registered with the OAM, the national agents and brokers registry. Italy’s financial regulator Consob has warned investors and Virtual Asset Service Providers (VASPs) that the MiCAR transition period will end on December 30, 2025. VASPs that do not apply for authorization as Crypto-Asset Service Providers (CASPs) by the deadline must cease… — Wu Blockchain (@WuBlockchain) December 5, 2025 After that, they must have taken concrete steps toward becoming MiCAR-compliant crypto-asset service providers, or CASPs, if they want to stay in business. Regulatory Shift Moves Italy Toward Europe’s Unified Crypto Rulebook VASPs that file an authorization application by Dec. 30, either in Italy or in another EU member state, will be allowed to keep serving customers while supervisors process their files. That temporary window will close once the application is approved or rejected, and in any case no later than June 30, 2026. The current regime in Italy only requires VASPs to register with the OAM. Under MiCAR, CASPs will need prior authorization from their supervisory authority and will then come under ongoing supervision, aligning Italy with the wider European push for stricter oversight after a series of global exchange failures and token collapses. To support an orderly and transparent transition, Consob issued a detailed notice that mirrors guidance published the same day by the European Securities and Markets Authority. The document spells out what retail users should do as the deadline approaches and what operators must put in place if they plan either to seek a license or wind down. Regulator Warns Users To Verify VASP Status Before Year-End Cutoff For investors, the regulator stressed that some VASPs currently operating may no longer be allowed to do so after December 30. It said clients should check whether they have received clear information from their provider on its plans, and if not, ask for an explanation of how it intends to comply with the new framework. Consob also told users to verify that a firm is legitimately allowed to operate in Italy after the deadline, either by checking the OAM list of VASPs or the ESMA register of authorized CASPs. If a provider is not legitimate, it cannot continue to offer crypto-asset services to the public and customers have the right to ask for the return of their funds or tokens. On the operator side, Consob recalled that it has already shared guidance through meetings and public communications, including a notice in Sept. 2024 with initial instructions for firms and another in July 2025 when the national transition period was extended to June 30, 2026. It also sent a specific warning on October 31, 2025 to VASPs on the OAM list that still lack MiCAR authorization. The regulator said VASPs that choose not to seek authorization as CASPs must stop their activities in Italy by December 30, 2025 and close existing contracts. They must return crypto-assets and related funds to customers in line with client instructions and end all services, including custody and administration. VASPs that remain on the OAM register are required to post clear information on their websites and provide direct notice to clients on the steps they plan to take, whether that is applying for a MiCAR license or exiting the market in an orderly way.

Observations indicate that the token is stuck within a consolidating phase, and its on-chain data showcases minimal, albeit steady, user interaction, and lackluster trading volume on the decentralized exchange. Given that technical analysts’ outlook is for this to continue within the $0.38 and $0.48 range, and that the literal truth is that Cardano is essentially trading where it was at the end of 2017, its short-term development story appears to be seriously muted. Despite the presence of high leveraging activities within its derivative market, the on-chain data of ADA reveals a lack of new demand, thus maintaining its stagnant state. This environment makes innovative projects such as Mutuum Finance (MUTM) a perfect alternative for anyone wondering what to buy among cryptocurrencies. 1. A Time-Sensitive Presale Opportunity with Explosive Potential Unlike Cardano, which is being sold at the same price that was eight years ago, the presale of Mutuum Finance is a dynamic and rapidly evolving event. The current stage of the presale, Phase 6, is 95% filled, offering a last opportunity to buy the tokens for $0.035. This phase is nearly sold out, and the next one, Phase 7, offers a price boost of almost 20%, to $0.04. While its launch price is placed at $0.06, existing investors can expect remarkable gains, making a new crypto coin a drastic difference from what is currently happening to other assets that are experiencing sideways movement. New crypto-investing opportunities that provide a definite entry time, unlike what is found at the Cardano platform, can be found here. 2. MUTM Stablecoin Furthermore, going beyond mere hypotheses, the relevance of Mutuum Finance is actually realized through its utility foundation that is inclusive of its innovative over-collateralized stablecoin. This is because its most prominent aspect contradicts the existing models of DeFi. This unique selling proposition addresses a key issue that decentralized finance protocols have, putting MUTM at the forefront of serious defi crypto that offers value. When other networks take a long time to develop, Mutuum is working towards creating a system that is really beneficial for users, making this a serious consideration for what is the best cryptocurrency to invest in. 3. An Engaging Leaderboard System Fostering Active Rewards Adding a new dimension of engaging the community on a constant basis, something that is lacking within most existing projects, is Mutuum Finance’s interactive dashboard that now includes a 24-Hour Leaderboard. This rewards the top holders of the asset on a daily basis. The number one-ranked holder earns a $500 MUTM bonus, as long as a transaction was made in the last 24 hours. This gamified incentive rewards loyalty, as well as fuels a thriving and active token economy, making this new cryptocurrency unique. The Verdict for Strategic Crypto Investment It is easier to make a choice after comparing a stagnated asset to a dynamic new opportunity. Cardano offers a story of stagnation and a possible breakout that is uncertain, whereas there’s a tangible opportunity to get involved in a limited-time presale, a game-changing utility of a stablecoin, and rewards from the community for a choice available through Mutuum Finance. For people who want the best crypto to buy now, the innovative model of faster expansion offered by Mutuum is a compelling option to resist the horizontal graph of older cryptocurrencies.

The company revealed Thursday that both its general counsel and head of policy plan to retire next year. This announcement follows a string of other high-level departures in recent days. A leading designer walked out the door Wednesday to join Meta Platforms. Earlier in the week, on Monday, Apple confirmed its head of strategy would be stepping down. The chief operating officer called it quits back in July, while the chief financial officer moved to a different position late last year. These exits signal a major shift happening inside Apple, though Chief Executive Officer Tim Cook appears to have no plans to leave his post. Cook and the team of new executives coming in must tackle a major challenge: getting Apple ready for artificial intelligence and the new gadgets competitors are building to compete. Talent drain extends beyond executive suite The problem runs deeper than just the executive suite. As reported by Cryptopolitan in recent months, dozens of Apple workers have jumped ship to OpenAI and Meta. This steady loss of talented people has taken innovators away from Apple while giving rival companies the know-how they need to try to knock the company off its throne in digital devices. Apple stays on top as long as people use its devices to access their online services. But other major tech companies don’t like Apple’s control over how apps get distributed, and they’re working hard to break free. Mark Zuckerberg, Sam Altman, and Elon Musk all want to control their own paths forward. This week, Zuckerberg brought on Alan Dye, a top Apple designer, after already taking several key AI staff members from Apple during a major hiring push. He wanted to rebuild Meta’s AI operations. After his “metaverse” project failed to replace the iPhone, Zuckerberg now focuses on AI and smart glasses to reach the same goal. OpenAI teams up with former Apple designer Altman spent $6.5 billion to bring in Steve Jobs’s protégé Jony Ive, who played a key role building the iPhone and Apple Watch. Ive’s team includes other former Apple heavyweights. Together, they’re working on an AI device they believe will become the future of computing. OpenAI’s new hardware division has been actively recruiting from Apple lately as well. A look at LinkedIn profiles shows dozens of Apple engineers and designers with skills in audio, watch design, robotics, and other areas have recently moved to OpenAI. Musk has thought about making his own smartphone because he’s frustrated with Apple’s market control, WSJ reported earlier. His company X is taking Apple to court over complaints about where his AI app appears in the App Store. None of these competitors pose an immediate danger. People’s entire digital lives sit on their iPhones. No breakthrough AI application exists yet that would convince them to switch devices, let alone a new device that offers such an app. But Apple faces a problem. Without a clear AI plan that shows customers and workers the company can meaningfully contribute to this decade’s most important technology, Apple creates room for rivals to make their move. One executive staying put is Cook despite reports of him being replaced next year. He turned 65 last month, an age when many chief executives think about retiring, but Cook keeps working at full speed. He proved his worth to investors again this year by skillfully managing relations with President Trump, stopping potential tariffs, and pushing Apple’s stock price to new highs. If Cook can launch successful AI products before he leaves, he can cement his place as one of the great tech executives while setting up whoever comes next for success.

DeepNode , a decentralized artificial intelligence network aiming to democratize AI development, has successfully raised $5 million across two funding rounds: a $2 million seed round at a $25 million valuation and a subsequent $3 million strategic round at a $75 million valuation.​ The funding represents a significant milestone for the project, which is positioning itself as the infrastructure for ""open intelligence"", a network where AI developers, compute providers, and validators can collaborate and earn rewards without relying on centralized tech giants.​ Community-First Seed Round DeepNode's seed round included participation from community members, with support from key network validators such as WildSageLabs from RoundTable21 and Rizzo from DNA, as well as infrastructure partner Gateway.FM. What makes this raise truly special is that it was driven by our community. The validators, miners, and early adopters pushing decentralized AI forward - the company stated in its announcement on X . The approach signals DeepNode's commitment to building what it calls a ""community-first"" ecosystem, where those who will actually operate the network infrastructure have early ownership stakes.​ Strategic Round Brings Global Infrastructure Investors The strategic round was led by a consortium of Web3 and AI infrastructure investors, including Blockchain Founders Fund, Side Door Ventures, TBV, IOBC Capital, Fomo Ventures, and Nestoris. These investors bring expertise spanning enterprise integrations, operational scaling, and go-to-market support.​ For the DeepNode team, the strategic backing represents more than capital; it's validation of the decentralized intelligence thesis. The investors have track records in Web3 infrastructure and understand how decentralized systems can reshape industries and digital economies.​​ Building the Multi-Tool for AI DeepNode differentiates itself from other decentralized AI projects through what it calls a ""multi-tool"" approach. Rather than focusing solely on large language models or a single use case, the platform is designed to handle any predictive or decision-making task across multiple industries. From healthcare diagnostics to fraud detection to crypto trading and more.​ The network operates using a novel Proof-of-Work Relevance (PoWR) consensus mechanism that rewards AI contributions based on actual utility rather than just computational output. Models compete and evolve based on real-world performance, with contributors earning emissions for valuable work.​ Infrastructure Development and Long-Term Planning DeepNode is building on Base, an Ethereum Layer-2 network, to leverage Ethereum's security while maintaining transaction costs below $0.01. The company plans to launch its mainnet by the end of Q1 2026, with foundation-supported domains already in development across multiple verticals. The combined funding will support DeepNode's multi-year roadmap to develop an open intelligence network. According to the team, the network aims to enable builders to retain intellectual property rights, allow contributors to earn based on performance, and provide enterprises with private participation options while leveraging shared network effects. Backed by a mix of ecosystem participants and strategic investors, DeepNode is pursuing a model of AI development that emphasizes collaboration, transparency, and contributor ownership. About DeepNode DeepNode is the infrastructure for open intelligence. A decentralized AI network where developers, validators, and compute providers collaborate, own their IP, and earn rewards for providing real-world utility via Proof-of-Work Relevance (PoWR).

Key Takeaways: Woori Bank is the first Korean commercial bank to display Bitcoin prices in its main trading room. The move reflects Bitcoin’s rising role in global market sentiment as Korean banks expand deeper into digital asset infrastructure. Upcoming regulations could position major banks like Woori as central players in South Korea’s future digital finance landscape. The move marks the first time a commercial bank in South Korea has integrated a crypto price feed directly into its frontline dealing environment, the space where traders handle foreign exchange, bonds and derivatives. Bitcoin Now Seen as Market Signal, Says Woori Bank Official A Woori Bank official said the decision reflects the growing weight of digital assets in global finance, noting that Bitcoin has increasingly become a signal for broader market sentiment. “As digital assets continue to grow in prominence and influence in global financial markets, we determined that they should be monitored as a key indicator to better read overall market trends,” the official said. The update comes as Korean banks step deeper into digital asset infrastructure. Hana Financial Group this week signed a partnership with Dunamu, operator of the Upbit exchange, to incorporate blockchain tools into services ranging from overseas remittances to financial data systems. While Woori has yet to announce a formal partnership with a crypto exchange, senior executives have repeatedly indicated that the bank intends to expand into digital asset services. CEO Jung Jin-wan said in October that payments and digital asset ecosystems are “increasingly interconnected,” suggesting the sector could open new revenue avenues for banks. SOUTH KOREAN BANKING GIANT WOORI BANK JUST STARTED DISPLAYING #BITCOIN PRICE IN THEIR DEALING ROOM BANKS ARE COMING!! pic.twitter.com/NBiXXhBLe0 — Vivek Sen (@Vivek4real_) December 5, 2025 Regulators are also shaping a clearer path. The government and ruling Democratic Party are examining a proposal that would restrict issuance of won-based stablecoins to bank-led consortia with majority bank ownership. If enacted, the framework could position major lenders like Woori as central players in future stablecoin markets. As reported, South Korean investors turned the Chuseok holiday into a high-risk trading week, pouring $1.24 billion into US tech and crypto-linked assets while local markets were closed between October 3 and 9. The frenzy was led by leveraged ETFs and high-growth stocks, as traders sought to ride Wall Street’s momentum amid optimism surrounding US tech resilience and domestic stimulus hopes. South Korea to Extend Crypto Travel Rule to Sub-$700 Transactions Last week, South Korea revealed that it is preparing one of its most aggressive crackdowns on cryptocurrency-related financial crime by expanding its travel rule requirements. The new threshold covers transactions under 1 million won ($680), which until now allowed users to bypass identity checks by breaking transfers into smaller amounts The Financial Intelligence Unit (FIU) will also introduce pre-emptive account-freezing powers in serious cases, allowing investigators to lock suspicious accounts before funds can be moved beyond recovery. Officials said legislative amendments are expected to be submitted to the National Assembly in the first half of 2026, with South Korea also expanding coordination with global regulators such as the Financial Action Task Force to align with international standards.

Here Are the Details,https://en.bitcoinsistemi.com/jpmorgan-analysts-reveal-the-most-important-factor-that-will-determine-bitcoins-short-term-price-here-are-the-details/,"JPMorgan analysts noted that the most critical element in Bitcoin's near-term price direction is not selling pressure from miners, but the financial resilience of Strategy, the world's largest institutional Bitcoin holder. JPMorgan: Bitcoin's Short-Term Price Will Be Determined by Strategy Durability The team, led by managing director Nikolaos Panigirtzoglou, stated in a report published on Wednesday that the Bitcoin price has been facing two main pressures recently: the decline in network hash rate and mining difficulty, and the uncertainty surrounding the Strategy. According to analysts, the decline in hash rate is due to China's re-emphasizing of its ban on private mining activities and miners curtailing their activities due to falling profitability due to high energy costs. While production costs have fallen, the price of Bitcoin is still below that cost, forcing some high-cost miners to sell, putting pressure on the market. JPMorgan calculated the cost of Bitcoin production at $90,000, a decrease from the previous month. However, analysts emphasize that selling pressure from miners is not the primary driver of Bitcoin's direction. The crucial factor is whether Strategy can meet its financial obligations without needing to sell Bitcoin. The metric, which measures the company's debt, dividends, and capital structure relative to its Bitcoin holdings, currently stands at 1.13, indicating that the company is not under selling pressure. Strategy's recently announced $1.44 billion in USD reserves is sufficient to easily cover dividend and interest payments for the next two years. This further reduces potential pressure for Bitcoin selling. Despite the company's slowing Bitcoin accumulation rate, its total holdings exceed 650,000 BTC. MSCI's index decision, scheduled for January 15th, is also being closely watched. According to JPMorgan, a potential delisting decision has been largely priced in by the markets. However, the Strategy's continued presence in the indexes could spark a strong recovery in both stock and Bitcoin prices. On the other hand, analysts state that in the long-term outlook, Bitcoin has a strong potential for value appreciation comparable to gold. *This is not investment advice.

The reason? Rampant bot activity that snatched the entire supply, leaving legitimate users empty-handed. This incident throws a harsh spotlight on the vulnerabilities of public sales and raises critical questions about access and equity in the crypto space. What Happened in the HumidiFi Token Sale? HumidiFi launched its much-anticipated public token sale, a key event for distributing its new token to the community. However, within moments, the process was compromised. The team discovered that a sophisticated bot network had created thousands of automated wallets. This army of bots executed transactions with impossible speed, purchasing the entire allocation of tokens before most human participants could even click a button. Consequently, the core promise of a fair, community-centric launch was broken. The HumidiFi team faced a critical decision: proceed with a sale dominated by a single, malicious actor or take decisive action to protect their community’s trust. Why Did HumidiFi Void the Token Sale? The decision to cancel and reschedule the HumidiFi token sale was not taken lightly. The team prioritized long-term integrity over short-term completion. By allowing the bot-dominated sale to stand, they would have endorsed an unfair outcome and concentrated the token supply in the hands of an entity likely seeking to manipulate the market later. Their official statement clearly outlined the primary reasons for the void: Prevention of Fair Access: Regular community members were completely locked out of the process. Market Manipulation Risk: A single entity controlling the entire supply poses a severe risk to price stability at launch. Upholding Project Values: To build a sustainable DeFi platform, trust and equitable distribution are non-negotiable. Therefore, voiding the sale was the only credible path forward to uphold the principles of decentralization. The Broader Challenge: Bots vs. Fair Launches The HumidiFi incident is not an isolated case. It exemplifies a pervasive challenge in cryptocurrency: ensuring fair launches in a landscape dominated by automated tools. Bots offer those who deploy them an insurmountable advantage in speed and volume, often undermining the democratic ethos of crypto. This creates a significant dilemma for projects. How can they design a token sale that is: Accessible to a global community? Resistant to automated exploitation? Simple enough for non-technical users? The rescheduled HumidiFi token sale will be a major test of their ability to implement solutions, such as enhanced wallet screening, CAPTCHA mechanisms, or participation limits, to level the playing field. What Can Users Expect from the New HumidiFi Token Sale? HumidiFi has announced a new public token sale for next Monday. While specific technical details of their anti-bot measures may not be fully disclosed to avoid giving attackers a roadmap, the community should expect a significantly fortified process. The team’s credibility now hinges on delivering a smooth and fair event. For users interested in participating, here are actionable insights: Stay Updated: Follow HumidiFi’s official social channels and blog for the latest sale mechanics and rules. Prepare Your Wallet: Ensure you have a compatible Solana wallet (like Phantom or Solflare) funded with SOL for transaction fees. Understand the Rules: Carefully read all participation guidelines released before the new sale date. Conclusion: A Necessary Reset for Trust HumidiFi’s bold move to void its bot-infested token sale, while disruptive, is a victory for principle over convenience. It sends a powerful message that the project values its genuine community more than a quick launch. The upcoming rescheduled sale is more than a do-over; it’s a crucial test of the DEX’s commitment to building a fair and resilient ecosystem on Solana. The entire crypto community will be watching to see if this reset successfully defends the ideal of equitable access. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: Why couldn’t HumidiFi prevent the bots before the sale? A1: Bot developers constantly evolve their tactics, often staying ahead of standard preventative measures. This incident shows how aggressive these attacks have become, forcing projects to adapt reactively and strengthen their systems for future events. Q2: Will my transaction from the voided sale be refunded automatically? A2: Yes. When a sale is voided, all transactions are typically reversed. The funds (SOL) used to attempt the purchase should be returned to your wallet. Always check your wallet balance and transaction history for confirmation. Q3: What stops bots from attacking the rescheduled HumidiFi token sale? A3: While no system is 100% foolproof, the HumidiFi team has likely implemented new safeguards. These could include more advanced bot detection software, wallet reputation checks, or changes to the sale mechanics itself to slow down automated participation. Q4: Is it safe to participate in the new sale? A4: Participating in any token sale involves risk. However, HumidiFi’s proactive response demonstrates a commitment to security and fairness. Ensure you only interact with the official HumidiFi website and verified social links to avoid phishing scams. Q5: How does this affect the future price of the HumidiFi token? A5: In the long term, a fair distribution can lead to a healthier, more decentralized token market with less risk of manipulation. Short-term price action is unpredictable, but the team’s action aims to build a stronger foundation for the token’s economy. Q6: Are other Solana DEXs vulnerable to similar attacks? A6: Any platform hosting a public, permissionless sale is a potential target. The HumidiFi token sale incident serves as a case study for the entire industry, likely pushing other projects to audit and reinforce their launch protocols.

ETF holdings remain around 1.43M $BTC and redemptions were concentrated in a few issuers, so the broader macro bull case for bitcoin stays intact. Bitcoin Hyper brings SVM-style, low-latency smart-contract execution to Bitcoin, targeting DeFi, gaming, and payments on top of BTC settlement security. PEPENODE launches a ‘mine-to-earn’ memecoin model where users run virtual nodes, progress through tiers, and earn gamified token rewards. US spot Bitcoin ($BTC) ETFs just saw roughly $4B in outflows since it reached an ATH in October. However, research suggests most of that was basis trades unwinding , not real capitulation. These were crowded arbitrage and carry trades shutting down as funding flipped, not long-term allocators fleeing Bitcoin for good. That distinction matters. If institutions aren’t dumping spot exposure en masse, the core bull thesis around Bitcoin as a macro asset remains intact. Structural demand from ETFs, corporates, and high-net-worth investors still underpins the market, even as leverage and short-term positioning reset in the background. For you, that backdrop favors asymmetric upside rather than chasing large-cap beta. The ETF bid can support Bitcoin, while the most explosive gains tend to come from early-stage infrastructure, AI, and high-throughput plays quietly building into the next cycle. Crypto presales are exactly where that risk/reward skew can be most extreme if you’re selective. Below are three presales positioned at key narratives: Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) for Bitcoin scalability, PEPENODE ($PEPENODE) for mine-to-earn memes, and Ionix Chain ($IONX) for AI-powered blockchains. They stand out in the current market as some of the best crypto presales to watch, alongside other leading early-stage plays. 1. Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) – First SVM-Powered Bitcoin Layer 2 Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) positions itself as the first true Bitcoin Layer 2 integrating the Solana Virtual Machine (SVM), aiming to deliver execution that’s even faster than Solana while anchoring settlement to Bitcoin. The modular design separates Bitcoin L1 for security and finality from a real-time SVM Layer 2 for high-throughput execution. On the technical side, Bitcoin Hyper uses a single trusted sequencer that batches and orders transactions, then periodically anchors state commitments back to Bitcoin. The core pitch is simple: bring fast, scalable smart contracts to Bitcoin without sacrificing its brand and security. That unlocks high-speed payments in wrapped $BTC with low fees, DeFi protocols for swaps, lending, and staking, plus NFT and gaming dApps. Our ‘What is Bitcoin Hyper?’ guide covers everything you need to know about the project, from its tokenomics to community sentiment. The market has responded positively to the project. The Bitcoin Hyper presale has already raised $29M, with tokens priced at $0.013375. Whales are also scrambling to get their slice of the pie, including one that bought over $500K of tokens . That kind of early conviction can signal confidence in the tech and tokenomics. Staking is a major part of the value proposition. You can stake yours immediately after purchasing so you can enjoy rewards that are currently at 40% APY. To get your share of tokens, head on to our Bitcoin Hyper buying guide for more details. If Bitcoin’s L2 race heats up, a performant SVM-based solution like Bitcoin Hyper could be one of the clearest leveraged plays. Join the $HYPER presale today. 2. PEPENODE ($PEPENODE) – First Mine-to-Earn Memecoin Infrastructure If Bitcoin Hyper is a pure infrastructure bet, PEPENODE ($PEPENODE) leans into the speculative energy of memes, but with a twist. It brands itself as the world’s first ‘mine-to-earn’ memecoin, combining viral culture with a virtual mining and node system that gamifies participation. Instead of relying solely on hype and social media, PEPENODE introduces a Virtual Mining System where you can deploy and upgrade nodes to earn token rewards. A tiered node structure sets different earning bands, effectively creating a gamified yield ladder. A dedicated dashboard wraps all of this in a simple interface designed that’s easy to understand even if you’re a complete beginner. This model turns what’s usually passive memecoin holding into something more interactive. If the narrative catches on, miners and speculators are incentivized to keep the system spinning. On the numbers, the PEPENODE presale has raised over $2.2M so far, with tokens priced at $0.0011778. That leaves plenty of room for upside if the mine-to-earn meme gains traction across other traders. You can also stake tokens to get dynamic rewards that are currently at a whopping 570% APY. We’ll show you how to purchase $PEPENODE in our ‘How to Buy PEPENODE’ page. The project’s medium-term prospects look bright, as long as it ticks off all the items in its roadmap and attracts more participants. When that happens, the token’s value could reach a high of $0.0072 by the end of 2026, or a 511% increase from the current price. Explore the PEPENODE presale now. 3. Ionix Chain ($IONX) – AI-Powered Layer 1 With Quantum Consensus Rounding out the list is Ionix Chain, an AI-powered Layer 1 targeting the intersection of high-performance smart contracts and machine learning. It uses a hybrid Proof-of-Stake engine with Directed Acyclic Graph architecture combined with what it calls Quantum AI Consensus, designed to self-optimize throughput, latency, and security parameters in real time. Ionix Chain’s performance targets are aggressive. The team claims up to 500K transactions per second with sub-second finality, positioning it squarely against high-throughput leaders rather than legacy L1s. Its adaptive smart contracts use AI to optimize gas usage, routing, and resource allocation, aiming to help dApps scale predictably as volumes spike. Cross-chain support is another core pillar. Ionix is building interoperability with Ethereum, Solana, and BNB Chain, giving developers a way to bridge assets and deploy applications that can tap liquidity across multiple ecosystems. That’s particularly relevant if multi-chain liquidity routing becomes standard for DeFi and AI-driven protocols. At the moment, Ionix Chain is running a multi-stage token presale that has raised over $6.3M so far. Another stage is coming in about four days, which will increase the price up another notch, so it’s always best to get in early. Early exchange partners have also been teased, positioning IONX as a notable AI-blockchain contender rather than a niche experiment. If you’re an investor betting on AI as a core crypto theme next cycle, Ionix offers direct infrastructure exposure. Learn more on the official Ionix whitepaper. With ETF outflows driven by basis trade unwinds rather than true capitulation, the broader Bitcoin bull case still stands. Recap: Bitcoin Hyper , PEPENODE , and Ionix Chain each target major narratives: Bitcoin scalability, gamified memes, and AI L1s. If you’re looking for alternative bets in the current market atmosphere, the three are worth a look.

The setup echoes last summer’s episode, when a policy shift in Tokyo triggered rapid deleveraging across risk assets, including crypto. Will The Bitcoin Price Crash Next Week? Analyst Benjamin Cowen explicitly links today’s environment to that July shock. He reminded followers that “in July 2024, the Fed cut rates while the BOJ raised rates, leading to the unwind of the carry trade. Bitcoin capitulated into it, and found a low 1 week later.” He added, “Good chance this happens again on December 10th (Fed cuts, BOJ raises rates). So maybe Bitcoin finds a low mid-Dec?” The precise sequencing last year was more nuanced – markets aggressively priced Fed easing while the BoJ surprised with a hike – but the core mechanism Cowen highlights is the same: when US policy is moving toward looser conditions just as Japan tightens, the long-running yen carry trade becomes unstable and high-beta assets sell off hard. Related Reading: Bitcoin Signals Bear Market: One Thing Could Flip It, Says CryptoQuant CEO Truflation’s thread lays out why this matters for Bitcoin and the wider crypto market. Large institutions and commercial banks “borrow money in Yen where interest rates are historically and famously low, and use that money to invest in the US.” They can park the funds in interest-bearing instruments to “earn healthy 3–4%” on the spread, or “more often, they invest in stocks and bonds to get way more.” This is reinforced by a BoJ policy of keeping the yen cheap against the dollar. The danger arises when stocks fall and the yen starts to rise or is expected to rise. Then “institutional and Commercial borrowers may exit, so as not to get stuck with significant losses on their Yen debts.” They “sell whatever assets they purchased in the US and get back into Yen to pay back their loans in Japan, resulting in a cascade of US asset sales and Yen purchases.” After “years of Yen carry trade being a relatively safe way for big banks and institutional investors to make easy money,” even a modest normalization can force broad, mechanical de-risking — and Bitcoin, as a liquid, leveraged risk asset, sits directly in that firing line. Crypto trader Kevin (@Kev_Capital_TA) underscores how tight the current window is. He notes that “we have the Fed’s preferred measure to track inflation via the Core PCE inflation and then the FOMC all in the next six days,” followed by a BoJ press conference on 19 December that will be “massive for Dollar, short end and long end of the yield curve not to mention Yen carry trade fears.” In a separate post, he stresses that “the JP10Y continues to make new highs. Pretty big deal folks,” highlighting that Japanese yields are grinding higher into that meeting and increasing pressure on the BoJ to act. Related Reading: US Sen. Lummis Hints At US Bitcoin Buy With ‘Franklin’ Meme A few days ago, BitMEX founder Arthur Hayes connected that macro repricing directly to Bitcoin’s latest leg down. “BTC dumped cause BOJ put Dec rate hike in play. USDJPY 155–160 makes BOJ hawkish,” he argues, framing the sell-off as a funding shock rather than a crypto-native event. Into December, futures and economist surveys put the probability of a Fed cut at roughly 80–87% for the 9–10 December meeting, even as the committee remains divided. At the same time, the BoJ is openly signalling it will “consider the pros and cons” of a hike at its 18–19 December meeting, with markets now pricing a high likelihood of tightening and 10-year JGB yields near multi-decade highs. That combination — Fed easing expectations plus BoJ tightening risk — is exactly the configuration that threatens the yen carry and makes a repeat of July 2024’s pattern plausible: a sharp flush in Bitcoin and other risk assets, followed by a bottom once forced deleveraging runs its course. At press time, BTC traded at $92,235.

The establishment of N3XT comes nearly three years after Signature Bank’s downfall in March 2023, which significantly impacted the crypto industry. Former Signature Bank Leaders Establish N3XT According to a report by Reuters, the newly founded blockchain-based bank aims to facilitate instant US dollar payments around the clock, led by Scott Shay, who served as the founder and chairman of the Signature Bank. Jeffrey Wallis, the former director of digital assets at Signature, will take on the role of CEO at N3XT. Per the report, N3XT will operate under a special-purpose bank charter in Wyoming and has decided to avoid typical lending activities, which were at the heart of the collapsed Signature Bank. “Every dollar of deposits will be backed by cash or short-term U.S. Treasuries,” Wallis explained, noting that the bank will publish its reserve holdings daily. This sets N3XT apart from its predecessor, Signature Bank , especially given that its reserves will be held with custodial partners, though Wallis did not disclose their names. Importantly, N3XT will not be insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) since Wyoming special-purpose banks are not required to obtain such insurance. The collapse of Signature Bank, along with the failures of Silvergate Bank and Silicon Valley Bank, pointed to a troubling trend among banks with significant uninsured deposits and ties to the cryptocurrency sector. Rising interest rates and a loss of depositor confidence culminated in bank runs that led to their downfall. Solutions For Crypto Clients Addressing concerns about the safety of client assets, Wallis reassured potential customers in the crypto industry, stating, “We do not lend against our balance sheet, so clients always have confidence that their capital is available to them and is never at risk.” He emphasized that the newly established bank is designed to offer a new and “unique banking structure,” ensuring that clients’ liquidity is readily accessible according to their economic needs. Wallis further distinguished N3XT’s approach to risk management from that of Signature Bank, which was criticized for “poor management” and a focus on “rapid, unrestrained growth” with little attention to risk. “We are not making any lending decisions with the balance sheet,” Wallis reiterated. “We are keeping our clients’ assets in full liquid form.” N3XT will reportedly focus on catering to crypto clients, many of whom Wallis mentioned are already in the onboarding process. As of this writing, Bitcoin (BTC), the market’s leading crypto, is trading at $92,834. It has consolidated above the key $90,000 support level for the past few days, sparking new hopes for a potential recovery above $100,000 by the end of the year.

This initiative marks a significant shift in how major exchanges cater to their most valuable clients, offering unprecedented access and personalized service. But what does this mean for the broader cryptocurrency landscape, and who exactly qualifies for these elite benefits? What Makes the Kraken VIP Program So Exclusive? The newly launched Kraken VIP program establishes clear thresholds that separate casual traders from the institutional elite. To qualify, participants must maintain an average account balance of $10 million or demonstrate an annual trading volume exceeding $80 million. These substantial requirements ensure the program serves only the most serious market participants. Kraken’s approach reflects a growing trend in cryptocurrency exchanges prioritizing institutional adoption. By creating dedicated pathways for high-volume traders, exchanges like Kraken signal their commitment to professionalizing the digital asset space. This development comes as traditional finance increasingly explores cryptocurrency investments. What Benefits Do VIP Members Receive? Participants in the Kraken VIP program gain access to premium features unavailable to regular users. The cornerstone benefit is a dedicated account manager who provides personalized support and strategic guidance. This one-on-one relationship ensures VIP clients receive immediate attention for their concerns and queries. Additionally, members enjoy early access to new Kraken products and features before they launch publicly. This advantage allows institutional investors to position themselves strategically in emerging markets and innovative financial products. The program likely includes other unannounced benefits such as: Reduced trading fees and enhanced rate structures Priority customer support with faster resolution times Advanced trading tools and analytics platforms Exclusive market insights and research reports Invitations to private events and networking opportunities Why Is This Important for Crypto Institutional Adoption? The introduction of a formal Kraken VIP program represents more than just premium service—it signifies cryptocurrency’s maturation as an asset class. Institutional investors require specialized infrastructure, compliance support, and relationship management that differs substantially from retail trading platforms. By addressing these needs directly, Kraken positions itself as a serious contender for traditional finance allocations. This development follows similar moves by competitors, indicating an industry-wide push toward institutionalization. However, Kraken’s specific thresholds and benefits structure suggest a targeted approach toward the upper echelons of wealth management. The $10 million balance requirement particularly signals a focus on family offices, hedge funds, and corporate treasuries rather than merely affluent individuals. What Challenges Might This Program Face? While the Kraken VIP program offers compelling benefits, it must navigate several potential challenges. Regulatory scrutiny of high-net-worth cryptocurrency programs has intensified globally, particularly concerning anti-money laundering compliance and source-of-wealth verification. Kraken will need to implement robust due diligence processes while maintaining the seamless experience VIP clients expect. Furthermore, the cryptocurrency market’s volatility could make maintaining consistent $10 million balances challenging for some qualified participants. Kraken may need to develop flexible qualification metrics that account for market fluctuations while preserving program exclusivity. The exchange must also ensure its infrastructure can handle the complex trading strategies and large order sizes institutional clients typically employ. How Does This Impact Regular Crypto Traders? Although the Kraken VIP program targets elite investors, its existence benefits the broader Kraken ecosystem. Resources dedicated to institutional clients often lead to platform improvements that trickle down to all users, including enhanced security measures, better trading engines, and more sophisticated tools. Additionally, increased institutional participation typically brings greater liquidity and market stability, creating better trading conditions for everyone. Regular traders should view this development as a positive signal about Kraken’s long-term viability and commitment to market leadership. However, they should also recognize that exchanges naturally prioritize their most profitable relationships, which could mean slower feature development for retail-focused tools compared to institutional offerings. Conclusion: A New Era for Crypto Exchanges Kraken’s VIP program launch represents a pivotal moment in cryptocurrency exchange evolution. By creating structured pathways for institutional capital, Kraken not only secures its competitive position but also advances the entire industry toward mainstream financial acceptance. The program’s success will depend on Kraken’s ability to deliver exceptional value while navigating regulatory complexities and market dynamics. As cryptocurrency continues its journey toward institutional adoption, programs like this will become increasingly sophisticated. The true test will be whether these VIP offerings can provide genuine competitive advantages that justify their exclusive nature while contributing to healthier, more robust cryptocurrency markets for all participants. Frequently Asked Questions What are the exact requirements for the Kraken VIP program? To qualify, users must maintain an average account balance of $10 million or have an annual trading volume exceeding $80 million. These thresholds ensure the program serves only substantial institutional investors and ultra-high-net-worth individuals. What specific benefits do VIP members receive beyond a dedicated account manager? While full details haven’t been disclosed, benefits include early access to new Kraken products, likely reduced trading fees, priority support, advanced trading tools, exclusive market insights, and invitations to private events. How does Kraken’s VIP program compare to competitors’ offerings? Kraken’s program appears competitive with similar institutional offerings, though specific comparisons depend on unpublished details. The $10 million balance requirement positions it toward the higher end of institutional programs currently available. Can international clients participate in the VIP program? While the initial announcement focused on U.S. operations, Kraken typically extends premium services to qualified international clients, though specific eligibility may vary by jurisdiction due to regulatory considerations. How does this affect Kraken’s existing premium services? The VIP program likely replaces or enhances previous premium offerings, creating a more structured, benefits-rich tier specifically designed for institutional-scale clients rather than merely active retail traders. What security measures protect VIP client assets? VIP clients benefit from Kraken’s enterprise-grade security infrastructure, potentially including additional safeguards like dedicated cold storage solutions, enhanced withdrawal protocols, and personalized security consultation.

The stock boom triggered by ChatGPT’s debut is now in its fourth year, but major players like Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. and SK Hynix Inc. are losing steam. Investors are now eyeing smaller companies such as MediaTek Inc. and Zhongji Innolight Co. instead. Analysts say the big names that supply critical AI components will likely recover after their recent pullbacks. But the spotlight is moving as the industry shifts focus from building large language models to practical uses of the technology and cutting costs. The shake-up started last month when Alphabet Inc. released an improved Gemini model and struck deals with other companies for its own AI chips. Amazon.com Inc.’s newest accelerator added to the momentum away from trades focused on OpenAI and chip giant Nvidia Corp. Japan’s SoftBank Group Corp., viewed as closely linked to OpenAI, saw its shares drop 38% in November, marking its worst month in 25 years. As reported by Cryptopolitan previously, TSMC fell 2% and SK Hynix fell 8% last month, cooling off after big gains. ChatGPT now faces growing competition, while Nvidia’s training chips are getting less attention as application-specific circuits gain importance. This has investors worried about price pressures. If large language models become common products, “the ones with cheaper costs will become the winner,” said Han Sangkyoon, chief investment officer at Quad Investment Management in Seoul. He thinks the next six months will determine “how the bubble created by Nvidia and OpenAI could burst.” New winners emerge in Asian markets Instead of leaving the AI trade entirely, investors are picking different stocks. Taiwan’s MediaTek, a chip designer partnering with Alphabet, posted its strongest week since 2002 after the Gemini launch. South Korea’s IsuPetasys Co., which makes circuit boards for Alphabet, jumped 18% to a record high last week. These moves show that Asian suppliers can profit regardless of which American tech giant leads the supply chain. “Around 90% of the hardware manufactured globally, which is fitting into data centers, servers, testing environment, anything you need from manufacturing the chips, memory cards, or even testing, cooling systems, all comes from Taiwan, Korea, Japan, Thailand, and even mainland China,” said Egon Vavrek, head of emerging markets and Asia equities at BlackRock Inc. Despite the AI competition between the US and China, their supply chains remain connected. Zhongji, an optical transceiver maker based in Shandong, gets 22% of its revenue from Alphabet and 11% from Amazon. Its shares climbed 11% last week to a new high. Established leaders maintain strong positions The established leaders aren’t finished yet. TSMC has the best chipmaking technology and manufactures for all major players. Its shares are headed for a third straight year of gains, pushing its value above $1 trillion. SK Hynix and Samsung Electronics Co. control over 90% of the global market for high-bandwidth memory, another key AI component, according to Macquarie Group Ltd. research. SK Hynix shares have more than tripled this year, and negative bets against the stock have decreased. Short interest dropped to 0.6% of free float from over 3% in May, based on S&P Global Inc. data seen by Bloomberg. But investors keep hunting for fresh ideas, driven by news, worries about expensive stocks, or limits on what they can hold. “AI remains front and center of tech investors’ minds, even after three years into the theme,” said Timothy Fung, head of Asia equity strategy at JPMorgan Private Bank in Hong Kong. “Opportunities are evolving across the AI supply chain, but remain linked to physical infrastructure.” Join a premium crypto trading community free for 30 days - normally $100/mo.",Economy|CNY|JPY|KRW|MediaTek|SK Hynix|THB|TSMC|TWD,EN,0,0,ASIA|BUSINESS|MARKET|TECHNOLOGY|TRADING,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-12-05 08:00:25

Attached to his tweet was a video of the CEO making this prediction at the ongoing Binance Blockchain Week in Dubai. His message was brief but clear, emphasizing the exact figure and date. That level of specificity quickly attracted comments from members of the XRP community , with many trying to interpret how much weight the forecast should carry. Ripple Brad Garlinghouse.

X Finance Bull argued that Garlinghouse would not give a figure like that unless strong developments were happening behind the scenes. According to that view, senior industry leaders often make such statements only when market infrastructure, liquidity, or institutional interest appears to be moving in a supportive direction. For these supporters, the forecast is seen as a potential indication of real activity shaping up in the background. Others call for data and careful evaluation A different segment of the community urged a more cautious approach. User mystik4l06 noted that predictions without supporting evidence should be treated carefully. They emphasized relying on data-driven research, balanced reasoning, and confirming information independently before accepting any long-term price target. This perspective reflects a common stance among traders who prefer analysis grounded in metrics, past performance, and clear reasoning rather than standalone forecasts. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Past accuracy becomes part of the debate Not everyone viewed the prediction positively. XRP Nation pointed to earlier forecasts from Garlinghouse, including a previous market-cap estimate that did not materialize. They argued that his predictions have been incorrect more often than correct. This response introduced the question of credibility, suggesting that past outcomes should be considered when evaluating new claims. How market participants may interpret the prediction The range of reactions shows how differently the community processes statements from high-profile figures. Some treat them as signals, others see them as opinions requiring evidence, and some judge them based on past accuracy. For market watchers, the most practical approach is to treat specific price-and-date claims as one viewpoint rather than a definitive expectation.

55384444,https://cryptonews.com/?p=460354,1764921909,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/52/55384444.jpeg,EU Wants ESMA to Oversee Crypto Like the SEC Does in US,https://cryptonews.com/news/eu-wants-esma-to-oversee-crypto-like-the-sec-does-in-us/,"The European Commission formally proposed transferring direct supervision of all crypto asset service providers to the European Securities and Markets Authority. This supervision was previously placed under the Markets in Crypto-Assets framework, with the licensing authority working with national regulators. The legislative package aims to eliminate regulatory fragmentation across 27 member states by granting ESMA powers comparable to those of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission over U.S. markets. The proposal arrives just nine months after its announcement in the Savings and Investments Union strategy. The strategy highlighted the political urgency behind capital markets integration as Europe confronts competitive pressures from U.S. financial markets. Source: Wikipedia Centralized Powers Target Cross-Border Efficiency ESMA would gain authority to directly authorize crypto firms seeking to operate across the bloc, replacing the passporting system, where companies secure approval in one jurisdiction before expanding throughout the EU. The regulator would also assume oversight of significant trading venues, central counterparties, and central securities depositories alongside its expanded crypto mandate. The Commission’s framework introduces “ Pan-European Market Operator ” status to streamline corporate structures into a single licensing format while enhancing ESMA’s coordination role in asset management. Officials positioned the changes as essential for responding to emerging risks and addressing inconsistencies from fragmented national approaches. The package simultaneously addresses barriers to distributed ledger technology by amending the DLT Pilot Regulation to increase proportionality and provide legal certainty for blockchain adoption. Member states will see directives converted into regulations to reduce national discretions that enable regulatory gold-plating. Member States Split Over Sovereignty Concerns France backed the centralization push after Bank of France Governor François Villeroy de Galhau warned that the current passporting model creates regulatory loopholes due to uneven oversight. “ This framework would benefit from much stricter regulation of the multi-issuance of the same stablecoin within and outside the European Union, to reduce arbitrage risks in times of stress, ” he said in October. Germany also recently signaled openness to expanded ESMA powers following years of opposition, while ECB President Christine Lagarde endorsed centralized supervision as essential for European competitiveness against the United States. Just last month, ESMA Chair Verena Ross highlighted the inefficiency of national regulators building 27 separate crypto frameworks when centralized resources could achieve better alignment. European Commission proposes transferring crypto exchange supervision from national regulators to ESMA in bid to standardize oversight across the bloc. #Europe #ESMA #MiCA https://t.co/ND271lQ1n3 — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) November 3, 2025 While others seem to be geared toward the idea, Luxembourg Finance Minister Gilles Roth rejected the shift, stating that his country prefers “ supervisory convergence rather than creating a costly and ineffective centralized model. “ In fact, Malta’s Financial Services Authority warned that centralization would introduce bureaucratic layers that would hinder competitiveness, at a time when the EU is striving to enhance its global position. Industry groups raised concerns about disrupting MiCA’s rollout before it is fully implemented. “ Reopening MiCA at this stage would introduce legal uncertainty, risk delaying the authorization process, and divert attention and resources from the practical task of consistent implementation, ” said Robert Kopitsch, secretary general of Blockchain for Europe. Implementation Timeline Faces Political Hurdles The European Parliament and Council must approve the proposals through negotiations, where maintaining package unity remains crucial for establishing a genuine single market across the investment chain. Officials expect Parliament to adopt a legislative framework position by May 2026, while member states aim for general agreement by year-end. ESMA will begin overseeing equity and bond price consolidation, alongside ESG ratings, from 2026 onward, with oversight of cryptocurrency extending the regulator’s authority as Europe pursues tighter market integration. The Commission emphasized that the reforms address fragmentation that raises costs for cross-border trades, a significant obstacle for startups scaling in Europe rather than the U.S. The initiative forms part of broader efforts to complete the EU’s capital markets union, after data-sharing rules published on November 26 established strict requirements for how crypto firms must collect, store, and report user information to tax authorities, starting January 2026. EU’s new crypto data-sharing rules will force exchanges and service providers to share user data and transaction records. #EU #CryptoPrivacy https://t.co/YoIDXmgNvm — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) November 27, 2025 The Transfer of Funds Regulation, which extends the travel rule to crypto, takes effect on December 30 and requires exchanges to identify transaction participants, including self-hosted wallet interactions.

South Korea’s leading exchange, Upbit, has dropped a significant announcement that will impact anyone holding Ethereum-based assets. The platform will temporarily suspend all deposits and withdrawals for tokens on the Ethereum network. This proactive measure supports a crucial upcoming Ethereum hard fork . If you use Upbit, understanding this timeline is essential to avoid any disruption to your trading activities. What is the Upbit Ethereum Hard Fork Suspension? Upbit has officially stated it will pause services for all digital assets on the Ethereum blockchain. This suspension includes popular tokens like ETH, USDT (ERC-20), and many others. The halt is scheduled to begin precisely at 12:00 p.m. UTC on December 9. The exchange is taking this step to ensure a smooth and secure transition during the network’s planned upgrade. This is a standard safety procedure for major exchanges during significant blockchain events. Why is This Hard Fork So Important? Think of a hard fork as a major software upgrade for the Ethereum network. It introduces new rules and improvements that are not backward-compatible. Therefore, all participants, including exchanges like Upbit, must update their systems to stay in sync with the new chain. The primary goals of such upgrades often include: Enhanced Security: Patching vulnerabilities and strengthening the network against attacks. Improved Efficiency: Optimizing how transactions are processed to potentially reduce costs and increase speed. New Functionality: Introducing features that expand what developers can build on Ethereum. By suspending movements, Upbit protects user funds from the risk of being sent to an incorrect address or lost during the chain split. What Should Upbit Users Do Before December 9? Don’t panic, but do prepare. The suspension affects deposits and withdrawals only. You can still trade Ethereum and ERC-20 tokens on the Upbit platform during this period. However, to ensure you are not caught off guard, follow these simple steps: Plan Your Transfers: Complete any necessary deposits or withdrawals well before the 12:00 p.m. UTC deadline on December 9. Monitor Official Channels: Follow Upbit’s official announcements for the exact resumption time, as it depends on the fork’s stability. Verify the Fork: Once services resume, consider making a small test transaction before moving large amounts. This planned interruption highlights the importance of staying informed about exchange notices and blockchain upgrade schedules. How Do Exchanges Like Upbit Handle a Hard Fork? Upbit’s approach is a textbook example of responsible exchange management. Their process typically involves: Announcing the suspension well in advance to give users ample warning. Taking a snapshot of user balances before the fork occurs. Halting movements to prevent transaction conflicts during the chain transition. Updating their node software to the latest version post-fork. Thoroughly testing the new network before safely re-enabling services. This meticulous process prioritizes the safety of user assets above all else, a key pillar of trust for any major exchange. What Does This Mean for the Future of Ethereum? Each successful hard fork is a step forward for Ethereum. These upgrades are vital for its long-term roadmap, which aims for greater scalability, security, and sustainability. While temporary service halts can be inconvenient, they are a necessary part of maintaining a robust and evolving decentralized ecosystem. The fact that leading exchanges like Upbit dedicate resources to support these upgrades underscores Ethereum’s continued institutional relevance. In summary, Upbit’s temporary suspension of Ethereum network services is a standard, safety-first procedure for the upcoming hard fork . By planning your transactions ahead of the December 9 deadline and following official updates, you can navigate this brief pause seamlessly. This event ultimately reflects the dynamic and progressive nature of the blockchain space, where upgrades pave the way for a more capable network. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: Can I still trade my ETH on Upbit during the suspension? A: Yes. The suspension applies only to depositing and withdrawing assets to and from the Ethereum network. Trading within the Upbit exchange will remain operational. Q2: How long will the deposit and withdrawal suspension last? A: Upbit has not announced a specific end time. The duration depends on the stability of the new network post-upgrade. Services will resume once the exchange completes its system updates and confirms security. Q3: Will I receive new forked tokens from this upgrade? A: This depends on the nature of the hard fork. Upbit will make a separate announcement if the fork results in a new distributable token and outline their support policy. Q4: Are other exchanges also suspending Ethereum services? A: It is highly likely. Most major exchanges proactively suspend deposits and withdrawals during significant network upgrades to protect user funds. Always check announcements from your specific exchange. Q5: Is my Ethereum safe on Upbit during the hard fork? A> Yes. The suspension is a protective measure. Your balances remain secure in your Upbit account. The exchange implements these protocols specifically to safeguard assets during the technical transition. Q6: What happens if I send an Ethereum transaction during the suspension? A: Transactions initiated during the suspension window will likely fail or be significantly delayed. It is crucial to complete all external transfers before the deadline to avoid complications. Found this guide on the Upbit Ethereum hard fork helpful? Navigating exchange announcements can be tricky.

In a stunning reversal, sterling has surged against major currencies, driven by what market analysts are calling a classic short squeeze scenario. This unexpected move in the forex market demonstrates how quickly sentiment can shift and why understanding market mechanics is crucial for currency traders. What Is Driving the Sterling Short Squeeze? A short squeeze occurs when traders who have bet against an asset (in this case, the British pound) are forced to buy it back to cover their positions as prices rise. This creates a self-reinforcing cycle where buying begets more buying. Several factors have converged to trigger this sterling short squeeze : Better-than-expected economic data from the UK Shifting expectations about Bank of England policy Technical breakouts triggering automated buying Reduced political uncertainty compared to previous months GBP/USD Technical Analysis and Key Levels The GBP/USD pair has been at the center of this movement. After testing support levels multiple times, the pair broke through resistance, triggering stop-loss orders and forcing short sellers to exit their positions. Key Level Significance Current Status 1.2800 Major psychological resistance Recently broken 1.2650 Previous support turned resistance Now acting as support 1.2500 Critical long-term support Held during recent declines How the Forex Market Reacts to Short Squeezes The forex market is particularly susceptible to short squeezes due to its high leverage and 24-hour trading nature. When a major currency like the British pound begins to move against consensus positioning, the effects can be magnified through several channels: Institutional traders rebalancing portfolios Retail traders following momentum Algorithmic trading systems responding to technical signals Options-related hedging activity Currency Trading Strategies During Volatile Moves For those engaged in currency trading , short squeezes present both opportunities and risks. The key is to distinguish between sustainable trends and temporary reversals. Successful traders often: Monitor positioning data to identify crowded trades Use tighter stop-losses during volatile periods Look for confirmation from multiple timeframes Pay attention to fundamental catalysts that could extend the move The Future of British Pound Strength While the current sterling short squeeze has provided a boost to the British pound , the longer-term trajectory will depend on several factors. Market participants are closely watching: Bank of England interest rate decisions UK economic growth relative to other major economies Political developments and fiscal policy Global risk sentiment and dollar strength FAQs About the Sterling Short Squeeze What causes a short squeeze in currency markets? A short squeeze occurs when traders who have sold a currency expecting it to fall are forced to buy it back as prices rise, creating additional upward pressure. How long do short squeezes typically last? The duration varies significantly. Some last only hours or days, while others can mark the beginning of longer-term trend reversals. Which institutions are most affected by GBP movements? Major banks, hedge funds, and multinational corporations with significant UK exposure are particularly affected by GBP/USD movements. Institutions like the Bank of England and major trading banks monitor these developments closely. Can retail traders profit from short squeezes? Yes, but it requires careful risk management. Retail traders can use technical analysis to identify potential squeeze scenarios and implement appropriate strategies. What’s the relationship between cryptocurrency and forex markets during such events? While different asset classes, both markets experience similar psychological dynamics. Traders who understand squeeze mechanics in currency trading often find parallels in cryptocurrency markets. The sterling short squeeze serves as a powerful reminder that markets can move violently against consensus. The British pound’s recent strength demonstrates how technical factors, positioning data, and shifting fundamentals can combine to create explosive moves in the forex market . For those engaged in currency trading , these episodes highlight the importance of risk management and the need to remain flexible in response to changing market dynamics. The GBP/USD pair will continue to be a key barometer of global risk sentiment and monetary policy divergence.

55384625,640604,1764922254,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/55384625.jpeg,"Strategy Won’t Sell Bitcoin, Fueling Bitcoin Hyper’s $29M Presale",https://bitcoinist.com/strategy-wont-sell-btc-bitcoin-hyper-presale-reaches-29m/,"Quick Facts: Bitwise CIO Matt Hougan doesn’t believe that Strategy will sell any of its Bitcoins, saying that the company has ‘enough cash to cover interest payments for the foreseeable future.’ This reinforces the digital gold thesis and supports a longer-term, institution-led $BTC accumulation narrative. Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) aims to fuse Bitcoin settlement with SVM-based execution, targeting sub-second, low-fee smart contracts to overcome BTC’s speed, cost, and programmability limits $HYPER just reached $29M in presale and targets a potential 1,395% post-launch ROI in 2026. Institutional conviction in Bitcoin just got a fresh boost. Bitwise CIO Matt Hougan has indicated that Strategy has no plans to dump its massive Bitcoin position, easing fears of a forced sell-off and reinforcing the idea that large, regulated players are thinking in halving cycles, not headlines. Strategy now holds 650,000 $BTC , valued at over $74B, and has just purchased another 130 $BTC on December 1. For you as a Bitcoin holder, that matters. When big allocators telegraph ‘we’re not selling,’ it stabilizes expectations around future supply and dampens the tail risk of sudden institutional liquidation. That macro backdrop is exactly why high-upside Bitcoin-adjacent plays are back in focus. If core $BTC exposure is the conservative base layer, then infrastructure tied to Bitcoin’s success – especially Layer 2 networks – becomes the speculative frontier where upside can be multiples higher if adoption hits. In that context, Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) and its ongoing presale stand out. Positioned as ‘the fastest Bitcoin Layer 2 with SVM integration,’ $HYPER is pitching itself as a way to turn Bitcoin’s settlement layer into a high-throughput smart contract environment, effectively grafting Solana-grade performance onto BTC’s security model. Read more about Bitcoin Hyper right here. Why Institutions Are Forcing a Rethink of Bitcoin Infrastructure Strategy’s public stance underscores a wider trend: institutional allocators are treating Bitcoin more like digital gold and less like a trade. Long-term balance sheet positioning, ETF flows, and strategy mandates are tightening the ‘float,’ which is great for price stability but leaves a big question unanswered – what about utility and throughput? Bitcoin’s base layer still clears roughly single-digit transactions per second, with on-chain fees spiking into tens of dollars during congestion. Lightning helps for simple payments, but it does not solve generalized programmability or DeFi-native use cases. That gap is why you’re seeing a race among Layer 2 designs targeting Bitcoin: rollups, sidechains, and virtual machine bridges all battling for mindshare. Projects like Stacks, Rootstock, and various rollup experiments each approach the problem differently, from separate smart contract layers anchored to $BTC to EVM-compatible sidechains. As markets digest that the ‘digital gold’ thesis is intact, attention naturally shifts to which infrastructure can unlock yield, DeFi, and dApps on top of it – and that’s where Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) is starting to enter the conversation alongside more established names. Read more about Bitcoin Hyper in our guide. Bitcoin Hyper’s SVM Layer 2 Pitch to Bitcoin Holders Where Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) differentiates itself is in its technical bet: integrating the Solana Virtual Machine (SVM) directly into a Bitcoin Layer 2. Instead of reinventing the wheel, the project leans on an execution environment already proven to handle thousands of transactions per second with sub-second finality, aiming to exceed Solana’s own performance by optimizing specifically for L2. The architecture is modular: Bitcoin Layer 1 handles settlement and security, while a real-time SVM Layer 2 processes execution. A single trusted sequencer batches transactions and periodically anchors state to Bitcoin, while SPL-compatible tokens are adapted for the L2. The Canonical Bridge handles the wrapped $BTC, lowering confirmation times to seconds and improving the network’s scalability dramatically. Investor interest is already material. The Bitcoin Hyper presale has jumped over $29M recently, with the token priced at $0.013375, signaling that the market is willing to fund a serious attempt at Bitcoin-native high throughput. Long-term, $HYPER positions itself as a potential slam dunk. Our price prediction for $HYPER , based on the project’s utility and investor support during the presale, hints at a 2026 target of $0.20. 2030 could push that number to $1.50 once the project breaches into the mainstream. In terms of raw profit, think ROIs of 1,395% and 11,115% respectively. For $BTC holders looking to stay within the Bitcoin orbit but earn on a more dynamic asset, that combination of yield, infrastructure exposure, and long-term profit-hunting potential could be compelling. $HYPER is making an aggressive case that a Solana-grade execution environment, plugged into Bitcoin finality, is one of the more asymmetric ways to express that view. If that sounds appealing, read our guide on how to buy $HYPER today. More importantly, do it soon, because Bitcoin Hyper has a targeted release window between Q4 2025, which is nearly over, and Q1 2026: time is not your friend. Buy $$HYPER on the official presale page. This isn’t financial advice. DYOR before investing.

Historical data suggests such extreme pessimism has often come right before short-term price jumps for the token. Market Sentiment Reaches a Potential Turning Point According to the latest data collected by social analytics platform Santiment, social media fear, uncertainty, and doubt (FUD) surrounding XRP has hit its most intense level since October. The firm’s methodology tracks the ratio of bullish to bearish comments across platforms like X, Reddit, and Telegram, and it noted that the last time a similar level of negative sentiment was observed was on November 21. Following that date, XRP’s price jumped 22% over the next three days before the advance stopped. This pattern matches a known market principle where prices sometimes move opposite to prevailing crowd psychology, setting the stage for a potential counter-trend bounce. This gloomy social mood also contrasts sharply with positive on-chain and institutional signals, with recent data showing the XRP Ledger’s Velocity metric, which tracks how frequently the token changes hands, reaching a yearly high. Analysts say that this means there’s a major increase in economic activity and liquidity on the network. Furthermore, as reported previously, U.S. spot XRP ETFs have seen net inflows for 13 consecutive trading days since their mid-November launch, attracting nearly $900 million in total. These funds have outperformed their Bitcoin and Ethereum counterparts over the same period. A Technical and Historical Perspective From a chart perspective, analysts are watching a key resistance level around $2.28. According to them, a sustained break above this price could open a path toward $2.75. The asset is currently trading around $2.09, having fallen over 4% in the past 24 hours and nearly 8% over the last month. Some technical observers have also pointed to similarities between the current setup and patterns seen in 2016-2017, before XRP’s historic bull run. They noted that momentum indicators like the Stochastic RSI on weekly charts are in oversold territory, a condition that has sometimes marked the end of recent downturns. Whether the current negative sentiment acts as a contrarian catalyst or simply reflects deeper issues remains the key question. The asset is trading more than 40% below its all-time high of $3.65, set in July 2025.

Here’s why,https://timestabloid.com/early-bitcoin-investor-xrp-was-built-for-this-moment-heres-why/,"Crypto commentator Pumpius linked new ADP employment figures to what he views as growing structural weakness in the U.S. small business sector. The report showed that small firms collectively cut about 120,000 jobs in November. Firms with one to nineteen employees accounted for roughly forty-six thousand of those cuts, and companies with twenty to forty-nine employees reduced around seventy-four thousand positions. Pumpius noted that this decline is part of a longer trend, with six monthly drops in the past seven months and a total loss of 264,000 jobs since spring. He described this as a level of stress not seen since the early pandemic period in 2020. XRP WAS BUILT FOR THIS MOMENT: Small business employment in the United States is collapsing and this is exactly the kind of macro environment that pushes capital toward assets like XRP. The latest ADP report shows • Small firms cut one hundred twenty thousand jobs in… pic.twitter.com/3EFT5HGoLk — Pumpius (@pumpius) December 4, 2025 How weakening employment ties into policy easing Pumpius argued that such sharp declines in small-business employment usually lead to a policy response centered on liquidity support and eventual interest rate cuts. According to his assessment, these measures tend to restart broader market cycles. He also stressed that when the economy weakens, rate cuts do not benefit all assets equally. In his view, capital moves away from purely speculative positions and toward assets that have clear use cases, regulatory progress, and rising institutional involvement. Why Pumpius believes XRP is well placed Pumpius highlighted a set of current developments he believes support XRP in this environment. He pointed to the introduction of ETF products , which he said can enable larger inflows from institutional and retail channels. He also mentioned that exchange reserves for XRP have fallen to multi-year lows, which he interprets as an indication of tightening supply. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 On the institutional side, he referred to ongoing work on settlement and treasury tools designed for enterprise use. He further noted that RLUSD provides a compliant source of stable liquidity and that regulatory clarity in several regions continues to advance. Overall perspective In Pumpius’s view, the sequence is straightforward: small-business weakness leads to easier policy. Easier policy increases liquidity, and liquidity tends to flow toward assets that provide real utility and operate within regulated frameworks. He concluded that XRP currently fits this profile. How strongly these conditions influence future market behaviour will depend on upcoming policy decisions, the pace of regulatory developments, and continued institutional adoption.

The Ethereum network, a titan of decentralized finance, recently experienced a surprising and sudden dip in its core operations. Ethereum validator participation temporarily fell, not due to a market crash, but because of a technical bug following a major network upgrade. This event highlights both the resilience and the intricate challenges of maintaining the world’s leading smart contract platform. What Caused the Ethereum Validator Participation Drop? Immediately after the successful Fusaka upgrade, a critical bug surfaced in the Prysm consensus layer client. This software, used by a significant portion of network validators, encountered an error while processing old validator attestations. Think of it as a key cog in a massive machine briefly jamming. The result was an immediate and measurable impact on network health. According to data from the Beaconchain explorer, the effects were stark. At epoch 411448: Network synchronization participation fell to 75%. Voting participation dropped even further to 74%. This incident underscores a vital truth: Ethereum validator participation is the heartbeat of the network’s security and finality. When it falters, even briefly, it draws immediate attention from developers and the community. How Did the Network Recover So Quickly? The story here is not one of failure, but of robust recovery. Ethereum’s distributed and multi-client design proved its worth. While the Prysm client faced issues, other clients like Lighthouse, Teku, and Nimbus continued operating normally. This diversity prevented a full network halt. Swift action from the Prysm development team and the broader validator community led to a rapid resolution. By epoch 411712, the network had largely bounced back: Voting participation recovered to 99%. Synchronization participation rose to 97%. Furthermore, the event triggered a natural rebalancing. The share of validators using the Prysm client decreased from approximately 22.71% during the incident to about 18% afterward, as some operators likely diversified their client software to strengthen network resilience. What Does This Mean for Ethereum’s Future? This temporary dip in Ethereum validator participation serves as a powerful real-world stress test. It demonstrates the network’s ability to withstand and quickly recover from client-specific bugs. However, it also highlights the ongoing importance of client diversity. Relying too heavily on a single client software remains a potential risk. The community’s response—promoting multiple clients and swiftly patching issues—shows a mature and proactive ecosystem. This incident is a reminder that even post-Merge, Ethereum’s evolution requires constant vigilance and collaboration from its global team of validators and developers. Conclusion: A Hiccup, Not a Halt The Fusaka upgrade bug was a brief, unexpected challenge in Ethereum’s continuous journey. The rapid decline and recovery of Ethereum validator participation proved the network’s fundamental strength and its community’s ability to respond under pressure. While perfect stability is an ideal, the real-world resilience shown here is arguably more valuable. It provides critical data, reinforces best practices around client diversity, and ultimately makes the network more robust for the future. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) What is Ethereum validator participation? Ethereum validator participation refers to the percentage of active validators on the Beacon Chain that are successfully performing their duties, such as proposing and attesting to blocks. High participation is crucial for network security and efficiency. What was the Fusaka upgrade? The Fusaka upgrade was a planned network update (hard fork) for Ethereum, aimed at implementing various improvements and optimizations to the consensus layer following the Merge. Is the Prysm client unsafe to use now? No. The bug was identified and addressed. Prysm remains a popular and reliable consensus client. However, the incident highlights why experts recommend client diversity —not relying on a single client type—to strengthen the overall network. Did this bug affect Ethereum transactions or DeFi protocols? The impact was primarily on consensus layer operations. While block finality was slightly delayed, user transactions and smart contracts on the execution layer (like those on Uniswap or Aave) were largely unaffected. How can I check current Ethereum validator participation rates? You can monitor real-time network health metrics, including participation rates, on public blockchain explorers like beaconcha.in . What should Ethereum validators learn from this event? Validators should ensure their client software is always up-to-date and consider the benefits of running a minority client to contribute to network diversity and resilience.

Our Bitcoin price prediction expects BTC’s price to reach $110K by the end of 2025 due to the bullish sentiment following the halving event. By 2031, BTC might touch $350,548 following increased institutional adoption. Since the beginning of 2024, Bitcoin’s price has doubled, but it has seen a notable 45% increase in just the two weeks following the presidential election. This boost has solidified Bitcoin’s role in the so-called “Trump trade,” with the president-elect’s positive stance on the cryptocurrency industry fueling investor optimism about this emerging asset class. As Bitcoin’s on-chain activities surge, questions arise, such as: “Does Bitcoin have the potential to hold above the $100K mark?” or “Will Bitcoin go up?” or “Where will Bitcoin be in 5 years?” Let’s answer them using our Bitcoin price prediction. Overview Cryptocurrency Bitcoin Ticker BTC Price $92,124 (-1.3%) Market capitalization $2.11 Trillion Trading volume (24-hour) $42.13 Billion (+18.9%) Circulating supply 19.87 Million BTC All-time high $124,457; August 14, 2025 All-time low $0.04865; Jul 15, 2010 24-hour high $93,620.95 24-hour low $90,976.68 Bitcoin price prediction: Technical analysis Metric Value Current Price $92,124 Price Prediction $ 97,689 (+5.52%) Fear & Greed Index 24 (Extreme Fear) Sentiment Bearish Volatility 7.85% (High) Green Days 11/30 (37%) 50-Day SMA $ 102,576 200-Day SMA $ 104,352 14-Day RSI 39.65 (Neutral) Bitcoin price analysis TL;DR Breakdown: BTC price analysis shows that Bitcoin declines toward $92K Resistance for BTC is at $93,990 Support for BTC/USD is at $91,014 The BTC price analysis for 5 December confirms that BTC faces a decline in bullish volatility as the price drops toward $92K.

BTCUSD Chart by TradingView If bulls fail to initiate a surge, the BTC price may drop below the immediate support line at $91,014, beginning a bearish trend to $83,856. Is Bitcoin a good investment? The rising institutional demand for Bitcoin etfs makes it a good investment option in the crypto market. However, Bitcoin has a short investment history filled with very volatile market value. Whether it is a good investment depends on your financial profile, investment portfolio, risk tolerance, and investment goals. It is suggested to conduct investment advice of the financial markets and understand the financial system risks. Why is Bitcoin down today? Bitcoin faced a surge in selling pressure as buyers failed to push the price above immediate fib levels. Will the BTC price reach $100K? Bitcoin price broke its much-anticipated mark of $100K, aiming for a new ATH. The price currently prepares to maintain its buying demand above $100K. Will BTC reach $1 million? $1 million is a significant milestone for the BTC price. However, it is achievable if Bitcoin continues to attract institutional interest in the coming years. Is Bitcoin a good long-term investment? As several institutions continue to accumulate BTC and Bitcoin faces a rise in global recognition, Bitcoin has a solid long-term future. Recent news/opinions on BTC As reported by Cryptopolitan , PayPal has launched a sweepstakes running from November 17 to December 21, offering weekly prizes and a total of 1,008 winners for eligible U.S. residents. The company promoted the event on X, highlighting over $1 million in bitcoin prizes with no purchase required. Bitcoin price prediction December 2025 Bitcoin’s price dropped toward $84K due to the rising bearish threat. However, it is now facing minor accumulation, which could mean we’ll see a peak around December 2025. Bitcoin’s price might attempt to maintain an average price of $95,000 and be pushed further, at least $105,000 if strong downward pressures are not seen. However, we might see a rejection on the bearish side, leading to a consolidation at around $82,000. Bitcoin Price Prediction Potential Low Potential Average Potential High Bitcoin Price Prediction December 2025 $82,000 $95,000 $105,000 Bitcoin price prediction 2025 Historically, Bitcoin has been a significant crypto coin in the year following a halving, and it is expected to push up its price. Bitcoin miners might play a crucial role in holding bullish sentiment for future price movements. Spot Bitcoin ETFs are projected to be a key driver of Bitcoin prices and the broader cryptocurrency market in 2025. As a result, Bitcoin’s trajectory might follow a bullish trend ahead with rising treasury term premium. Furthermore, there is an increasing bullish sentiment that the base interest rates could be cut in the US, and thus, help to further the upward movement of Bitcoin . An outcome of which the 2025 year could be positive for Bitcoin, with its crypto-price perhaps touching $110,000 at the highest and the low could be around $68,000.

However, more financial products including a surge in ETF flows might hold BTC prices within a bullish region. The digital assets market sentiment shows bullish signals for Bitcoin hit new highs. As the overall sentiment gives a bullish outlook, one should research more about Bitcoin before investing. We might see a maximum price of $185,000, with a minimum price of $115,000 and average price of $130,000. However, BitMEX CEO Arthur Hayes predicted the BTC price to touch $700K in 2026. Bitcoin price prediction 2027 Based on a detailed technical analysis of past Bitcoin price data, it is projected that in 2027, Bitcoin could see a minimum price of $140,491. The potential maximum price is estimated to be $216,738, with an average value of $170,100. Bitcoin price prediction 2028 By 2028, Bitcoin’s price is expected to reach a low of $164,063. Maximum price projections are as high as $244,142, averaging about $185,068 for the year. Bitcoin price forecast 2029 Projections for 2029 suggest that Bitcoin could be valued at a minimum of $195,629.

Cryptopolitan’s Bitcoin (BTC) Price Prediction A surge in bitcoin adoption and the expansion of the Bitcoin ecosystem might end the controversy of “Bitcoin bubble” in future. This might boost the Bitcoin cost and strengthen the Bitcoin network. At Cryptopolitan, we are bullish on Bitcoin’s future price as the historical market sentiment is extremely impressive. By the end of 2025, Bitcoin might record a maximum of $110,000, with a minimum price of $68,000 and an average price of $100,000. However, Bitcoin’s future market potential entirely depends on its buying demand, regulation, and investor sentiment regarding long-term holdings. Crypto analysts provide a positive sentiment as macroeconomic trends turn promising. We expect Bitcoin price to surpass a high of $216,000 by the end of 2027. Bitcoin historic price sentiment BTC price history: Coinmarketcap Satoshi Nakamoto created Bitcoin in 2009, marking the first use of blockchain technology. Bitcoin was initially of little value, gaining significant traction and hitting over $15,000 during the 2017 boom, with further highs reached in 2019 and 2021. In 2021, Bitcoin peaked at $68,789.63 but dropped to $15,760 by December 2022 amid economic pressures, including inflation and geopolitical conflicts. By April 10, 2023, Bitcoin’s price surged 83%, breaking the $30,000 resistance level. Throughout mid-2023, Bitcoin’s value hovered around $30,000, nearly reaching $32,000 due to positive market sentiments and potential ETF approvals. Bitcoin experienced a significant price drop in mid-August 2023, falling to $25,000. However, its prices remained volatile, fluctuating between $26,000 and $29,500 in October. Bitcoin closed 2023 above $42,000, a 155% increase from the year’s start. In early 2024, Bitcoin rose above $45,000 on ETF anticipation but briefly dipped below $40,000 after approvals. It broke its 2021 all-time high in March, reaching $73,750.07 on March 14, before dropping below $60,000 in April. May saw another surge above $70,000, while June and July brought heavy fluctuations between $70K and $55K. Bitcoin rallied to $66K in September after a Fed rate cut, climbed to $70K in October’s Uptober rally, and surged toward $108K following Donald Trump’s victory in the November US elections. BTC ended 2024 consolidating below $95K. At the start of January 2025, BTC was trading between $92,788.13 and $95,824.39. However, it formed an ATH at $109,114 on January 20. In the weeks of February, the price of BTC dropped heavily as it dropped toward the $78K low. In March, the price of Bitcoin declined heavily and dropped toward a low of $76.6K. In April, the price of Bitcoin started recovering. By the end of April, it neared the critical $95K zone. In May, Bitcoin price skyrocketed and it formed a new ATH at $111,970. However, the price declined later, toward $104K. By the end of June, BTC price reclaimed the $108K level. In July, BTC price triggered a surge toward $123K; however, it faced strong selling pressure later. In mid-August, the price of Bitcoin surged above $124K. However, the price failed to maintain its momentum as it dropped below $110K in early-September. By the end of September, the price of Bitcoin dropped further and touched a low around $108K. In October, the price of Bitcoin crashed heavily below $110K. The price crashed further toward $84K in November.",Crypto Price Predictions|BTC,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|BUSINESS|FIAT|MARKET|REGULATION|TRADING|UNI|MACROECONOMICS|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-12-05 09:11:33

Garlinghouse invokes the pro-crypto regulatory framework, led by the CLARITY Act, as the main driver behind Bitcoin’s coming performance. Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) targets Bitcoin’s biggest limitations by using an SVM-powered Layer 2 to bring high-throughput smart contracts and DeFi directly into the $BTC ecosystem. The $29M $HYPER presale targets a release date between Q4 2025 and Q1 2026 and a 2026 price point of $0.20, with an ROI of 1,395%. Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse has doubled down on his ultra-bullish view of Bitcoin, telling recent interviews he sees the leading cryptocurrency trading near $180K by the end of 2026. The statement came during a Binance event , which also hosted names like Solana Foundation’s president, Lily Liu, and Binance’s CEO, Richard Teng. In Garlinghouse’s view, the main drivers behind Bitcoin’s resilience are the increased regulatory crutches, with the CLARITY Act having the biggest impact. His thesis leans on improving US regulatory clarity and a steady wave of institutional allocations that still look early compared with traditional assets. Historically, when Bitcoin sets a new trajectory, the highest beta plays are not spot $BTC itself, but the infrastructure projects sitting closest to its liquidity and narrative. Within that race, Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) is positioning itself as a pure bet on Bitcoin’s next chapter: a high-performance Layer 2 that lets $BTC holders tap Solana-style throughput and smart contracts without abandoning Bitcoin’s security model. For traders hunting asymmetry into the next leg higher, the project’s surging presale is emerging as one of the more aggressive ways to express that thesis. You can learn more about how to buy Bitcoin Hyper here. Why Bitcoin’s Bullish Roadmap Pushes Capital Into Layer 2 If Bitcoin does grind toward six-figure territory on the back of ETF inflows, corporate treasuries, and regulatory détente, base-layer capacity will not suddenly expand with it. Block space is capped, and higher prices historically mean higher fees, making it even less practical to run complex applications directly on Bitcoin. That is why developers are experimenting across the stack: Lightning for payments, sidechains like Rootstock for EVM compatibility, and a new crop of high-throughput Layer 2s aiming to bring serious DeFi and gaming volume on top of $BTC. You are seeing a clear market narrative: keep Bitcoin as the settlement root, but move everything else to modular execution layers. In that emerging field, Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) sits alongside other Bitcoin scaling plays, but with a more aggressive performance target. While some solutions focus on incremental improvements, Bitcoin Hyper is explicitly chasing Solana-class throughput on a Bitcoin-secured stack, giving $BTC holders another way to gain exposure if they believe Garlinghouse’s $180K scenario will demand real transactional capacity. $HYPER is available for purchase on the presale page. How Bitcoin Hyper Turns Bitcoin Into a High-Throughput DeFi Base Where most Bitcoin scaling solutions still struggle with programmability, Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) goes straight at the bottleneck: smart contracts and execution speed. The project runs a modular architecture where Bitcoin Layer 1 acts as the settlement and security anchor, while a real-time Layer 2 powered by the Solana Virtual Machine (SVM) handles execution. By integrating SVM, Bitcoin Hyper can, in principle, match or exceed Solana’s low-latency environment for Rust-based dApps while routing value back to Bitcoin. Think higher speeds, lower on-chain costs, sub-second finality times, and vastly improved scalability. The market is already rewarding that thesis. The Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) presale has raised over $29.M so far, with the token currently at $0.013375, signaling strong demand from traders. Based on Bitcoin Hyper’s express utility, we expect a sustained post-launch pump. Our price prediction for $HYPER hints at a potential 2026 target of $0.20 for an ROI of 1,395%. Once the mainstream market buys into the project’s utility proposition, $HYPER could reach $1.50 by 2030, for a return rate of 11,115% or higher. The project targets a release date between Q4 2025 and Q1 2026, meaning timing is of the essence. Read our guide on how to buy $HYPER today to stay ahead of the curve. Buy your $HYPER on the official presale page. This isn’t financial advice. DYOR before investing.

That’s the alarming reality traders faced today as major platforms Upbit and Coinbase experienced significant service disruptions. These cryptocurrency exchange outages highlight the fragile infrastructure supporting the digital asset ecosystem and raise urgent questions about reliability. What Caused the Latest Cryptocurrency Exchange Outages? Early reports indicate the service disruptions affecting Upbit and Coinbase stem from issues at Cloudflare, the web infrastructure provider that supports numerous cryptocurrency platforms. Cloudflare acts as a critical intermediary, handling security, performance, and reliability for websites and applications. When their systems experience problems, the effects cascade through dependent services. This isn’t the first time Cloudflare-related issues have impacted cryptocurrency exchanges. Last month, a similar incident caused widespread interruptions across multiple platforms. The recurring nature of these cryptocurrency exchange outages suggests systemic vulnerabilities that need addressing. How Do These Disruptions Affect Crypto Traders? When cryptocurrency exchange outages occur, traders face several immediate challenges: Missed Trading Opportunities: Volatile market movements can’t be capitalized on during downtime Potential Financial Loss: Open positions can’t be managed or closed Anxiety and Uncertainty: Not knowing when service will resume creates stress Broken Trust: Repeated outages damage confidence in platform reliability The timing of these cryptocurrency exchange outages matters significantly. During periods of high volatility, even minutes of downtime can result in substantial financial consequences for active traders. This reality underscores why infrastructure reliability isn’t just a technical concern but a fundamental requirement for any serious trading platform. Are Centralized Points of Failure Inevitable? These cryptocurrency exchange outages reveal a troubling pattern of centralized infrastructure creating single points of failure. While Cloudflare provides valuable services that enhance security and performance, its central position in the web infrastructure creates systemic risk. When one component fails, multiple unrelated services suffer simultaneously. This situation raises important questions about decentralization in practice. Cryptocurrency advocates often emphasize decentralized networks as more resilient than traditional systems. However, when trading platforms rely on centralized infrastructure providers, they reintroduce the very vulnerabilities decentralization aims to eliminate. What Can Traders Do During Exchange Outages? While you can’t prevent cryptocurrency exchange outages, you can prepare for them. Consider these practical steps: Diversify Your Exchange Accounts: Maintain active accounts on multiple platforms Use Limit Orders Strategically: Place orders that will execute automatically when conditions are met Monitor Alternative Information Sources: Follow exchange status pages and social media for updates Consider Self-Custody Solutions: For long-term holdings, hardware wallets reduce exchange dependency Remember that during cryptocurrency exchange outages, patience and caution serve you best. Avoid making panic decisions based on incomplete information. The platforms will eventually restore service, and markets will continue functioning. What Does This Mean for Exchange Infrastructure? The recurring nature of these cryptocurrency exchange outages suggests infrastructure challenges that extend beyond any single incident. Exchanges must balance several competing priorities: Scalability to handle increasing user numbers and trading volumes Security against increasingly sophisticated threats Reliability to maintain continuous service availability Performance to execute trades with minimal latency Each cryptocurrency exchange outage provides valuable lessons about where infrastructure needs strengthening. The most resilient platforms will be those that learn from these incidents and implement redundant systems that can withstand component failures. Conclusion: Building More Resilient Crypto Infrastructure Today’s cryptocurrency exchange outages serve as a stark reminder that technical infrastructure remains the foundation of reliable trading. While we can’t eliminate all potential points of failure, we can build systems that are more resilient when problems occur. The cryptocurrency industry has made tremendous progress in many areas, but infrastructure reliability requires ongoing attention and investment. As traders, we must recognize that occasional disruptions are part of the evolving cryptocurrency landscape. However, we should also demand continuous improvement from the platforms we trust with our assets. Each cryptocurrency exchange outage should lead to concrete improvements that make the entire ecosystem more robust. Frequently Asked Questions How long did the Upbit and Coinbase outages last? Service disruptions varied by platform and region, with most users experiencing issues for several hours. Some services were restored gradually rather than all at once. Were user funds at risk during these outages? According to official statements from both exchanges, user funds remained secure in cold storage during the service disruptions. The issues affected trading access but not the underlying asset security. Can traders get compensation for losses during exchange outages? Most exchange terms of service explicitly state they’re not liable for losses due to technical issues. However, some platforms have occasionally offered goodwill gestures following significant outages. How can I check if an exchange is experiencing problems? Most major exchanges maintain status pages that show real-time service availability. Third-party monitoring services also track exchange performance across multiple platforms. Are decentralized exchanges affected by similar infrastructure issues? Decentralized exchanges (DEXs) operate differently and aren’t dependent on centralized web infrastructure in the same way. However, they face their own technical challenges and potential points of failure. What should I do if I have an open position during an exchange outage? Remain calm and wait for service restoration. Avoid attempting risky workarounds. Once access returns, assess your position and make informed decisions based on current market conditions.

The trouble became clear on November 17, when Finance Minister Katayama Satsuki showed Takaichi-san a chart during a meeting at her official residence. The chart reportedly revealed heavy selling in government bonds. Selling like that lifts long-term borrowing costs, and it hit right as she prepared to fund her plan through new debt. Naturally, her mood instantly soured, as this pressure threatened the yen, investor trust, and every single cent of the cash she needed to launch her highly-anticipated ‘Sanaenomics.’ The stakes are incredibly high for the entire global economy, because Japan remains the second most financially influential country on the planet. The yen sits near record lows when adjusted for inflation, and Japan highest debt-to-GDP ratio in the developed world. Takaichi-san need markets to stay calm so she could raise money without sending yields into a spiral. The meeting pushed her officials to change their public tone in hopes of calming investors, though it is currently unclear whether the change would slow the selloff or stop traders from pulling more cash out of Japan’s bond market. Markets push yields higher and corner Sanaenomics Japan’s 10-year government bond yield has climbed to its highest point since 2007. It gained 25.5 basis points in four weeks, the fastest rise in almost three years. That move spilled over into global markets and rattled traders who already worried about rising government financing costs worldwide. Demand from the central bank and insurers had slowed, leaving fewer buyers to absorb the debt that Takaichi-san needed to issue. She told Parliament there was no chance of a “Truss shock”, referring to the chaos that hit the UK in 2022 when Liz Truss’ tax plan triggered a collapse in gilt prices and a plunge in the pound. She also eased her earlier resistance to tighter monetary policy and promised to limit new borrowing. Takaichi-san introduced what analysts called a Japanese-style DOGE plan aimed at cutting public waste. Katayama said the government was paying close attention to markets and would protect the country’s finances and investor confidence. The shock in bonds pulled down the Nikkei, which fell 536.55 points, or 1.05%, showing how the jump in yields filtered through stocks. Other markets across Asia moved unevenly.

The cryptocurrency now appears alongside traditional financial indicators, including the won-dollar exchange rate and stock market data. The development represents the first instance of a South Korean commercial bank incorporating crypto pricing into its frontline dealing environment. Traders who handle foreign exchange, bonds, and derivatives now have direct access to real-time Bitcoin data. Bitcoin price display, Source: X A bank official explained the rationale behind the integration. Digital assets have gained significant influence in global financial markets. Bitcoin serves as an important signal for broader market sentiment. The bank views cryptocurrency monitoring as essential for understanding overall market trends. Banking Sector Embraces Digital Asset Infrastructure The Korean banking industry is expanding its involvement in digital asset services. Hana Financial Group partnered with Dunamu this week. Dunamu operates the Upbit exchange. The collaboration will bring blockchain technology into various banking services. These include overseas remittances and financial data systems. Woori Bank has not yet announced a formal exchange partnership. However, senior executives have consistently indicated plans to enter the digital asset space. CEO Jung Jin-wan addressed the topic in October. He described payments and digital asset ecosystems as increasingly interconnected. The executive suggested the sector could generate new revenue streams for traditional banks. Regulatory developments are creating clearer frameworks for institutional involvement. The government and the ruling Democratic Party are reviewing a proposal for a stablecoin . The plan would limit won-based stablecoin issuance to bank-led consortia. Banks would need to hold majority ownership in these arrangements. If passed, major lenders like Woori could become central players in stablecoin markets. Retail Investors Drive Crypto Activity South Korean retail investors demonstrated a strong appetite for digital assets during the recent Chuseok holiday period. Between October 3 and 9, investors allocated $1.24 billion to US tech and crypto-linked assets. Local markets remained closed during this period. Leveraged ETFs attracted substantial capital. High-growth stocks also drew significant interest. Traders attempted to capitalize on the momentum on Wall Street. Optimism about the US tech sector's resilience and potential domestic stimulus measures fueled the surge in trading. South Korea announced plans for comprehensive cryptocurrency transaction monitoring last week. The country will expand its travel rule requirements to cover smaller transactions. The new threshold applies to transfers of less than 1 million won, approximately $680. Current regulations allow users to avoid identity verification by splitting transfers into smaller amounts. The updated rules will close this loophole. All transactions will require proper identification, regardless of the transaction size.",News|Bitcoin,EN,0,0,BTC|FIAT|MARKET|TRADING|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-12-05 09:28:32

Ethereum’s revival gains momentum, and experts predict a price increase to $4,200 by the end of the year because of technological improvements and a massive upgrade that happens this December. However, a new crypto coin called Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has appeared, offering a remarkable opportunity via its ongoing presale that is quickly moving to its next phase. For those who have alternatives to choose from for where to place their crypto, especially if they want to acquire a crypto that promises them serious short-term gains, this is the defining characteristic of the crypto market. Ethereum Price Analysis Observing the price of Ethereum, there is a noted improvement as the digital currency is stabilizing above key support levels. After trading around $2,986, the price of ETH is found to be forming higher lows, preparing to break through the barrier of $3,058, leading to a route towards $3,618 and finally to $4,200. This is a positive technical forecast that is reinforced by another upcoming upgrade from FUSAKA scheduled for December 3. Market analysts, who remember the previous increase of 55% because of a positive upgrade, discover a stimulating factor for a possible breakout. Additionally, the decrease of 2.11% for exchange reserves triggers a stabilizing factor for this possible breakout. In this way, for those who think about investing now to reap profits, a good technical choice is Ethereum. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) While Ethereum is designed for steady and constant expansion, a new cryptocurrency, known as Mutuum Finance, is explosive. The first presale of this effort is currently at Phase 6, filled to a capacity of 95%, giving a final opportunity to invest in this new altcoin, called MUTM, for a price of just $0.035. This price value has already appreciated by a magnitude of 250% from its initial phase. It will make a price appreciation of nearly 20%, to $0.04, inevitable for Phase 7. It is worth noting that this platform has been able to raise a massive fund of $19,100,000, giving them a total of 18,310 holders. By this, MUTM is a strong contender for the title of the best cryptocurrency to invest your money into, especially if you’re a high yield investor because, of course, the buyers now have a great opportunity of making massive profits. The innovative aspect that makes this project a distinguished defi crypto is quite visible. It now has a newly developed dashboard that provides a 24-Hour Leaderboard, a system that rewards the top-ranked person each day with a $500 bonus for being a holder of MUTM. Security is a high-priority consideration, given that there is currently a independent audit of the lending and borrowing smart contracts being performed by Halborn Security. It is also a positive aspect of authenticity that there is a concrete development roadmap, such as the release of the V1 protoco l on the Sepolia testnet in Q4. Offered by Mutuum Finance, this is a limited entry opportunity for a new crypto asset that is about to experience a massive price surge even before its official launch. This is a platform that provides a predictable and forecasted analysts’ route to success. This limited entry opportunity for investing in the tokens that can be had at the existing price is a severely time-sensitive situation, thus being exactly what is pertinent for those who can make the most of what could be the next big thing in crypto.

This transaction, reported by blockchain analytics platform Lookonchain, represents one of the most significant institutional cryptocurrency movements recently observed. The transfer of 1,083 BTC to what appears to be a Coinbase Prime custody address raises important questions about corporate cryptocurrency strategy and institutional adoption trends. What Does This SpaceX Bitcoin Transfer Actually Mean? The recent SpaceX Bitcoin transfer involves 1,083 Bitcoin moving from one digital wallet to another, with blockchain analysts identifying the receiving address as belonging to Coinbase Prime. This platform specializes in institutional-grade cryptocurrency services, particularly custody solutions for large corporate and institutional clients. The transaction’s timing and destination suggest this isn’t a routine trade but rather a strategic move toward professional asset management. Several key aspects make this transaction noteworthy: The substantial value – approximately $99.81 million at current prices The institutional destination – Coinbase Prime’s custody service The potential confirmation of SpaceX’s ongoing Bitcoin strategy Why Would SpaceX Move Bitcoin to Custody? Institutional cryptocurrency custody serves several critical functions for corporate holders. First, it provides enhanced security through professional management of private keys and multi-signature arrangements. Second, it offers regulatory compliance frameworks that are increasingly important as cryptocurrency regulations evolve. Third, institutional custody enables easier integration with traditional financial systems and reporting requirements. The SpaceX Bitcoin transfer to Coinbase Prime likely reflects several strategic considerations: Risk Management: Professional custody reduces security risks associated with self-custody Operational Efficiency: Streamlined management for corporate treasury operations Regulatory Preparedness: Positioning for evolving cryptocurrency regulations Strategic Flexibility: Maintaining liquidity options while securing assets How Does This Impact the Broader Crypto Market? This substantial SpaceX Bitcoin transfer carries implications beyond just one company’s treasury management. Institutional movements of this scale often signal broader trends in cryptocurrency adoption. When high-profile companies like SpaceX make deliberate moves toward professional cryptocurrency custody, it validates the infrastructure developing around digital assets. The transaction demonstrates several important market developments: Growing institutional confidence in cryptocurrency infrastructure Increasing sophistication in corporate digital asset management Validation of custody solutions as essential institutional tools Potential signaling effect for other corporate holders What Can We Learn From This Transaction? Analyzing the SpaceX Bitcoin transfer provides valuable insights into institutional cryptocurrency behavior. The move to professional custody rather than exchange trading suggests a long-term holding strategy. This aligns with increasing recognition of Bitcoin as a corporate treasury asset rather than merely a speculative investment. Key takeaways for observers include: Institutional cryptocurrency adoption continues evolving beyond simple acquisition Professional custody solutions are becoming standard for corporate holders Blockchain transparency allows unprecedented visibility into institutional moves High-profile transactions influence market sentiment and adoption patterns Conclusion: A Significant Moment in Institutional Crypto Adoption The recent SpaceX Bitcoin transfer represents more than just a large transaction – it symbolizes the maturation of institutional cryptocurrency management. As companies move from initial acquisition to sophisticated custody and management strategies, the entire ecosystem grows more robust and legitimate. This transaction underscores how leading technology companies are not just investing in cryptocurrency but integrating it into professional financial operations. While the exact motivations behind SpaceX’s move remain speculative, the pattern is clear: institutional players are building serious, long-term cryptocurrency strategies with appropriate infrastructure and risk management. This development should encourage both individual and institutional investors to consider how professional custody and management fit into their own digital asset approaches. Frequently Asked Questions How was the SpaceX Bitcoin transfer identified? Blockchain analytics platform Lookonchain identified the transaction by tracking wallet movements and recognizing patterns associated with institutional addresses. The receiving address matched known Coinbase Prime custody wallets based on previous transaction patterns and blockchain analysis. Why would SpaceX use Coinbase Prime for custody? Coinbase Prime offers institutional-grade security, insurance, and compliance features specifically designed for corporate clients. Their custody solution provides multi-signature security, regulatory compliance frameworks, and integration with traditional financial systems that appeal to large organizations. Does this mean SpaceX is selling its Bitcoin? Not necessarily. Moving Bitcoin to custody typically indicates a long-term holding strategy rather than preparation for selling. Custody solutions secure assets while maintaining them on the blockchain, allowing for future strategic moves without immediate trading pressure. How common are large institutional Bitcoin transfers? While exact statistics vary, large institutional transfers have become increasingly common as more corporations and funds adopt Bitcoin. Transactions in the $50-100 million range occur regularly, though they often receive less attention than high-profile moves like SpaceX’s. What security measures protect custodial Bitcoin? Professional custody services typically employ multiple security layers including cold storage (offline wallets), multi-signature requirements, geographic distribution of key fragments, insurance coverage, and regular security audits by independent firms. Could this transaction affect Bitcoin’s price? While single transactions rarely directly impact Bitcoin’s market price, high-profile institutional moves can influence market sentiment. Such transactions often signal confidence in Bitcoin’s long-term value, potentially encouraging other institutional players. Found this analysis of the SpaceX Bitcoin transfer insightful?

Blockchain security firm PeckShield recently flagged a transaction where 2,295 ETH, valued at approximately $7.3 million, was sent from an address linked to the exploit directly to the crypto mixing service Tornado Cash. This action represents a critical phase in the laundering of assets stolen during an $8.4 million hack that ultimately forced the decentralized exchange to shut down. Who Is the Bunni DEX Hacker and What Happened? The story begins in October when Bunni, a decentralized exchange built on Ethereum, announced it would cease operations. The reason was severe financial strain following a devastating security breach. An attacker exploited a vulnerability, making off with $8.4 million in user funds. The platform’s team, unable to recover from the loss, had no choice but to wind down. Now, months later, the perpetrator is actively moving the illicit gains. Tracking the Bunni DEX hacker involves following the digital trail on the blockchain. While transactions are public, identifying the individual behind an address is notoriously difficult. The recent movement of 2,295 ETH to Tornado Cash is a clear attempt to obscure this trail. Crypto mixers like Tornado Cash break the connection between the source and destination of funds by pooling and scrambling cryptocurrencies, making them a preferred tool for laundering stolen crypto. Why Is Moving Funds to Tornado Cash a Major Red Flag? Sending stolen assets to a mixer is a classic final step for a crypto thief. It signals an attempt to cash out or repurpose the funds without being traced. For the community and investigators, it often marks the point where recovery becomes nearly impossible. This move by the Bunni DEX hacker confirms the stolen ETH is being prepared for the broader market. Anonymity Seeking: Tornado Cash obfuscates transaction history, severing the link to the original theft. Cash-Out Preparation: Mixed funds can be sent to exchanges or converted into other assets with reduced risk of being frozen. Regulatory Spotlight: Such actions keep Tornado Cash and similar protocols under intense scrutiny from global regulators. What Does This Mean for DeFi Security and Users? Incidents like the Bunni DEX exploit serve as stark reminders of the risks in the decentralized finance space. While DeFi offers unprecedented access and control, it also places the burden of security on users and protocol developers. The exit of the Bunni DEX hacker with millions underscores a persistent vulnerability. Therefore, users must practice diligent security. This includes using reputable protocols, understanding smart contract risks, and employing hardware wallets. For developers, rigorous audits and bug bounty programs are no longer optional but essential to maintain trust and ensure longevity. Can the Stolen Funds Ever Be Recovered? The short answer is, it’s highly unlikely once funds enter a mixer like Tornado Cash. However, the blockchain’s transparency means the address of the Bunni DEX hacker is known and can be blacklisted. Exchanges and decentralized applications can monitor for these tainted funds, but recovery for the original victims is a complex legal and technical challenge that rarely sees full success. In summary, the movement of $7.3 million by the Bunni DEX hacker into Tornado Cash is more than a transaction; it’s a cautionary tale. It highlights the sophisticated methods criminals use and the critical need for robust security at every level of the DeFi ecosystem. While innovation continues at a breakneck pace, security must keep up to protect user assets and foster sustainable growth. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) What was the Bunni DEX hack? The Bunni DEX hack was a security exploit in October where an attacker stole approximately $8.4 million from the decentralized exchange’s liquidity pools, leading to the platform’s shutdown. What is Tornado Cash? Tornado Cash is a decentralized, non-custodial cryptocurrency mixing service on Ethereum that enhances transaction privacy by breaking the on-chain link between source and destination addresses. Why would a hacker use Tornado Cash? A hacker uses Tornado Cash to launder stolen funds. By mixing the cryptocurrency with others, it becomes extremely difficult for investigators or blockchain analysts to trace the assets back to the original crime. Can stolen crypto sent to Tornado Cash be recovered? Recovery is very difficult. While the originating address can be identified and blacklisted, the mixed funds are designed to be untraceable, making it hard for authorities or victims to reclaim them. What should I do to protect my assets in DeFi? Use protocols that have undergone multiple professional security audits, be cautious of unusually high yields, use hardware wallets for significant holdings, and never share your private keys or seed phrases. Has the person behind the Bunni DEX hack been caught? As of now, the identity of the hacker remains unknown. Blockchain analysis can track the funds, but linking an Ethereum address to a real-world identity typically requires off-chain investigation by law enforcement.

Starting December 8th, all NEAR deposits and withdrawals will be paused. This Bithumb NEAR suspension is not a cause for alarm but a necessary step to support a significant network upgrade for the NEAR Protocol blockchain. Let’s break down exactly what this means for your assets and what you need to know. Why is Bithumb Suspending NEAR Transactions? The primary reason for this Bithumb NEAR suspension is to ensure a smooth and secure network upgrade for the NEAR Protocol. Exchanges often temporarily halt deposits and withdrawals during such events to prevent transaction errors or loss of funds. When a blockchain undergoes a core upgrade, any transactions sent during the transition could become stuck or sent to incorrect addresses. Therefore, Bithumb is proactively safeguarding user assets by implementing this pause. The suspension is scheduled to begin at 9:00 a.m. UTC on December 8th. Importantly, trading of NEAR tokens on Bithumb’s spot markets will likely remain unaffected during this period. This means you can still buy and sell NEAR within the exchange. The halt is specifically for moving tokens on and off the Bithumb platform via the NEAR network. What Should NEAR Users on Bithumb Do? If you use Bithumb for NEAR Protocol, don’t panic. This is a standard operational procedure. However, you should take a few simple steps to prepare. Complete Planned Transactions Early: If you need to deposit or withdraw NEAR, ensure you do so well before the 9:00 a.m. UTC deadline on December 8th. Monitor Official Channels: Keep an eye on Bithumb’s official announcements for the exact resumption time. The suspension is temporary and will be lifted once the exchange confirms the network upgrade is stable. Understand the Scope: Remember, your NEAR holdings in your Bithumb wallet are safe. Only the transfer functions are being paused temporarily. What Does This Mean for the NEAR Protocol Ecosystem? This upgrade, necessitating the Bithumb NEAR suspension , is ultimately a positive sign for the network. Regular upgrades are essential for blockchain platforms to improve scalability, security, and introduce new features. Major exchanges like Bithumb participating in these upgrades demonstrates institutional support and a commitment to the protocol’s long-term health. It shows the NEAR ecosystem is active and evolving. For the broader crypto community, this event is a practical reminder of how centralized exchanges interact with decentralized networks. While your crypto assets represent ownership on a blockchain, the gateway services (deposits/withdrawals) provided by exchanges are centralized operations that must coordinate with these decentralized events to ensure user safety. Key Takeaways and Final Thoughts In summary, the Bithumb NEAR suspension is a planned, temporary measure for a technical upgrade. It highlights the proactive steps a major exchange takes to protect its users. While slightly inconvenient, such suspensions are a normal part of the crypto landscape and underscore the ongoing development within projects like NEAR Protocol. The key is to stay informed and plan your transactions around these known maintenance windows. By cooperating with these necessary pauses, users and exchanges together support the stability and advancement of the blockchain networks we rely on. The short-term halt paves the way for long-term improvements in the NEAR ecosystem. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: Is my NEAR token safe on Bithumb during the suspension? A1: Yes, your NEAR holdings in your Bithumb account are secure. The suspension only affects the ability to deposit new tokens or withdraw existing ones to an external wallet. Trading within Bithumb may continue as normal. Q2: Can I still trade NEAR on Bithumb during this time? A2: Typically, yes. Exchange announcements for network upgrades usually specify that only deposit and withdrawal services are suspended. Spot trading (buying and selling NEAR for other cryptocurrencies or fiat) on the Bithumb platform is often unaffected. However, always check the latest official notice from Bithumb for confirmation. Q3: How long will the Bithumb NEAR suspension last? A3: The announcement states the suspension begins on December 8th. The duration is usually until the exchange team verifies the NEAR network upgrade is complete and stable. This can take several hours to a full day. Bithumb will make a new announcement when services resume. Q4: What happens if I send NEAR to my Bithumb deposit address during the suspension? A4: It is strongly advised NOT to do this. Transactions sent during a suspension may not be credited to your account automatically and could be lost or require lengthy manual recovery processes by support staff. Always wait for the official “resumed” notice before making deposits. Q5: Are other exchanges also suspending NEAR services for this upgrade? A5: It is common for multiple exchanges that support NEAR to coordinate similar suspensions during a major network upgrade. You should check the announcements from any other exchange where you hold NEAR to see if they have published similar maintenance notices. Q6: Where can I get official updates on this situation? A6: For the most accurate and timely information, monitor Bithumb’s official website, blog, and verified social media channels. Do not rely on information from unofficial sources or social media comments. Found this guide on the Bithumb NEAR suspension helpful?

This was the stark reality for users of Upbit, one of South Korea’s largest cryptocurrency exchanges, when a critical Cloudflare outage brought services to a grinding halt. The Upbit Cloudflare outage serves as a powerful reminder of how dependent the crypto ecosystem has become on third-party infrastructure providers. What Caused the Upbit Access Delays? On [Date], Upbit officially announced that access to both its PC web platform and mobile application had become unstable. The exchange identified the root cause as a service disruption at Cloudflare, the global content delivery network and security company that protects websites from malicious traffic. This Upbit Cloudflare outage effectively created a digital roadblock, preventing legitimate users from accessing their trading accounts while the technical teams worked to resolve the issue. The timing of such disruptions can be particularly problematic in cryptocurrency markets, where prices can fluctuate dramatically within minutes. Users reported various symptoms including: Complete inability to load the Upbit website Mobile app login failures Transaction timeouts during critical trading periods Delayed order execution notifications Why Does Cloudflare Matter for Crypto Exchanges? You might wonder why a cryptocurrency exchange like Upbit relies so heavily on a service like Cloudflare. The answer lies in security and performance. Cloudflare provides essential services that protect exchanges from distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks, which are unfortunately common in the crypto space. Additionally, Cloudflare’s global network ensures faster loading times for users worldwide by caching content closer to them. However, this dependency creates a single point of failure. When Cloudflare experiences issues, as happened during this Upbit Cloudflare outage , all websites and services relying on their infrastructure become vulnerable. This incident highlights the delicate balance exchanges must maintain between security, performance, and reliability. How Did Upbit Respond to the Service Disruption? Upbit’s response to the Upbit Cloudflare outage followed standard crisis communication protocols. The exchange promptly notified users through official channels, including their website and social media platforms. Transparency during such events is crucial for maintaining user trust, especially when financial assets are involved. The exchange’s technical team worked alongside Cloudflare engineers to restore services as quickly as possible. While the exact duration of the disruption varied for different users, most reported restored access within [estimated time frame]. This incident demonstrates how even well-prepared exchanges must contend with external dependencies beyond their direct control. What Can Crypto Traders Learn from This Incident? The Upbit Cloudflare outage provides several important lessons for cryptocurrency traders and investors: Diversify your exchange accounts : Don’t keep all your assets on a single platform Enable price alerts : Use external tools to monitor market movements during exchange downtime Understand platform dependencies : Research what third-party services your preferred exchanges rely on Have contingency plans : Know alternative ways to access markets during technical disruptions Furthermore, this event underscores the importance of exchanges developing robust backup systems and redundancy measures. While complete independence from third-party services may be impractical, minimizing single points of failure should be a priority for all platforms handling financial assets. The Broader Impact on Cryptocurrency Infrastructure This Upbit Cloudflare outage wasn’t an isolated incident affecting just one exchange. Cloudflare provides services to numerous cryptocurrency platforms, exchanges, and blockchain projects worldwide. When their infrastructure experiences problems, the ripple effects can spread across the entire crypto ecosystem. The incident raises important questions about decentralization in practice. While blockchain technology itself is decentralized, the infrastructure supporting its adoption—exchanges, wallets, and security services—often relies on centralized components. This creates potential vulnerabilities that the industry must address as cryptocurrency adoption continues to grow. Conclusion: Navigating the Fragile Digital Infrastructure The Upbit Cloudflare outage serves as a wake-up call for both cryptocurrency exchanges and their users. While third-party services like Cloudflare provide essential security and performance benefits, they also introduce external dependencies that can disrupt access to digital assets. The crypto industry must continue evolving toward more resilient infrastructure designs while users should maintain diversified access strategies. As cryptocurrency adoption accelerates, the reliability of supporting infrastructure becomes increasingly critical. Incidents like this Upbit disruption highlight the need for continuous improvement in both technical systems and user education about platform dependencies and risk management. Frequently Asked Questions What exactly happened during the Upbit Cloudflare outage? Upbit experienced service disruptions because Cloudflare, their content delivery and security provider, had a widespread service outage. This prevented users from accessing Upbit’s website and mobile app reliably. Were user funds safe during the Upbit disruption? Yes, according to Upbit’s statements, user funds remained secure in cold storage wallets. The issue affected access to the platform interface, not the underlying blockchain assets or storage systems. How long did the Upbit Cloudflare outage last? The duration varied by user location and connection, but most services were restored within [estimated time frame] as Cloudflare resolved their infrastructure issues and Upbit implemented necessary fixes. Can this type of outage happen to other exchanges? Yes, any exchange using Cloudflare or similar third-party infrastructure services could experience similar disruptions if those providers have technical issues. Most major exchanges rely on such services for security and performance. What should I do if my exchange experiences an outage? First, check the exchange’s official communication channels for updates. Avoid panic selling on other platforms unless absolutely necessary. Use external price tracking tools to monitor markets while waiting for service restoration. How can exchanges prevent such outages in the future? Exchanges can implement redundant systems, work with multiple infrastructure providers, develop offline contingency plans, and regularly test their disaster recovery procedures to minimize disruption impact.

55387828,640651,1764927914,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/55387828.jpeg,Best Crypto to Buy as the NYSE Lists Its Largest Bitcoin Treasury Firm,https://bitcoinist.com/best-crypto-to-buy-as-twenty-one-capital-hits-nyse/,"Quick Facts: Twenty One Capital waits for its NYSE debut on December 9, with a $BTC treasury of 43.5K tokens, which ranks it third on the list of the largest Bitcoin treasuries, after Strategy and MARA. Twenty One Capital’s NYSE debut underscores institutional Bitcoin demand, increasing the strategic relevance of scalable $BTC infrastructure like Bitcoin Hyper. Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) will use a modular Bitcoin Layer-1 + SVM Layer-2 design to bring sub‑second, low‑fee smart contracts to the Bitcoin ecosystem. PEPENODE’s ($PEPENODE) mine‑to‑earn structure turns meme coin speculation into a gamified virtual mining experience with tiered node rewards. Twenty One Capital’s NYSE debut, with more than 43.5K $BTC on its balance sheet, is a watershed moment for institutional Bitcoin exposure. The official launch is set for December 8 , with the company set to list on December 9. Once it hits the public sphere, Twenty One Capital will be the largest Bitcoin holder listed on the NYSE. Twenty One capital is the third-largest public $BTC treasury company globally, after MARA and Strategy, which are both listed on the Nasdaq. The takeaway is clear: if regulated equity vehicles are racing to accumulate $BTC, the infrastructure that can actually make Bitcoin capital productive is where the asymmetric upside sits. Layer-2 scaling, yield infrastructure, and stable settlement rails suddenly matter a lot more. Here are three assets that sit neatly in that flow of capital: Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) as a hyper‑performance Bitcoin Layer-2; PEPENODE ($PEPENODE) as a speculative mine‑to‑earn meme coin riding the risk curve; and USDC ($USDC) as the settlement backbone tying it all together. 1. Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) – First Bitcoin Layer-2 With SVM If listed treasuries are hoarding $BTC, the obvious next question is how to make that Bitcoin programmable. Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) positions itself as one of the fastest Bitcoin Layer-2s with Solana Virtual Machine (SVM) integration, aiming to deliver execution that outperforms Solana while anchoring security to the Bitcoin Layer-1. Instead of trying to jam smart contracts into Bitcoin’s base layer, Bitcoin Hyper will use a modular design: the Bitcoin Layer-1 will handle settlement and finality, while a real‑time SVM‑powered Layer-2 executes transactions at extremely low latency and low cost. That opens the door to sub‑second confirmation times and fee levels closer to Solana‑style micro‑payments rather than congested Layer-1 Bitcoin fees. On the programmability side, SVM compatibility means developers can deploy Rust‑based smart contracts, supporting SPL‑style tokens modified for this Layer-2. That makes it far easier for existing Solana‑native teams to port DeFi primitives, NFT collections, or gaming dApps into the Bitcoin ecosystem without rewriting their entire stack. The Canonical Bridge is in charge of creating the wrapped Bitcoins, once the Bitcoin Relay Program confirms incoming transactions in record time. The live presale has already passed the $29M milestone, an indication that $HYPER is clearly drawing institutional‑style speculation ahead of launch. Right now, $HYPER costs $0.013375 per token, with staking at 40% APY. The project targets a release window between Q4 2025 and Q1 2026, so if you want to join the presale, read our guide to buying $HYPER before the clock runs out. Based on the investor interest during the presale and the project’s utility proposition, we expect the token to experience a considerable post-launch surge once the initial dump settles. Our price prediction for $HYPER puts the token at a potential $0.20 in 2026 for an ROI of 1,395%. 2030 could push it to $1.50 once the project starts seeing mainstream support with return rates of $11,115%. If these predictions check, $HYPER could become one of the best crypto to buy in 2026 and beyond. Head to the presale page and buy your $HYPER today. 2. PEPENODE ($PEPENODE) – Mine‑to‑Earn Meme Coin Experiment While Bitcoin Hyper targets infrastructure, PEPENODE ($PEPENODE) leans into speculation and gamification as the self‑proclaimed world’s first mine‑to‑earn memecoin. Instead of traditional staking or liquidity mining, users participate in a virtual mining system where node ownership and activity determine reward tiers. This ‘tiered node rewards’ model turns what would usually be passive holding into an interactive experience. Users scale up their node exposure to climb the rewards ladder, while a gamified dashboard visualizes mining progress, earnings, and competition with other participants. It’s a meme coin, but with a pseudo‑operational layer of simulated infrastructure underneath. From a capital‑flow perspective, PEPENODE offers a higher‑beta play that can benefit when Bitcoin strength and institutional headlines pull liquidity further out the risk curve. The presale has already raised over $2.2M, leaving room for upside if the mine‑to‑earn mechanic gains traction with retail. Currently at $0.0011778, the PEPENODE presale offers a dynamic staking APY of 570%. Our guide to buying $PEPENODE explains how to join the presale. If the marriage between the coin’s meme value and its on-chain utility works, we could see it pump post launch. A fair price prediction for $PEPENODE hints at a potential target of $0.0072 in 2026. Make that $0.0244 by 2030, once the mainstream market starts taking notice. In terms of profit, think ROIs of 511% and 1,971% respectively. If you believe speculative capital will chase novel tokenomics as Bitcoin grinds higher on institutional demand, PEPENODE is a structured way to express that view. Buy your $PEPENODE on the official presale page today. 3. USDC ($USDC) – Institutional‑Grade Stablecoin Rail If Twenty One Capital’s listing represents regulated $BTC exposure, USDC ($USDC) is the complementary rail for dollar liquidity. $USDC is a fully collateralized, US dollar‑pegged stablecoin designed to enable fast, transparent, and low‑cost digital dollar transactions across borders and platforms. Each $USDC is backed by cash and short‑dated US. Treasuries held in segregated accounts, making it a favorite among institutions and DeFi protocols that need predictable redemption and regulatory clarity. Crucially, $USDC is now available natively on more than 16 blockchains and supports Circle’s Cross‑Chain Transfer Protocol (CCTP), enabling seamless movement of liquidity between ecosystems without centralized exchange hops. That multi‑chain footprint and composability have helped push $USDC’s market cap above $78B as of December 2025, cementing its position as the world’s second‑largest stablecoin by circulation. It functions as base collateral in DeFi, settlement currency on major exchanges, and a bridge between banks, fintechs, and crypto‑native rails. In a world where publicly listed firms are turning to Bitcoin and regulators scrutinize stablecoins, $USDC offers a relatively conservative way to sit in on‑chain dollars while moving quickly between trades. If you’re rotating between $BTC, altcoin bets like $HYPER and $PEPENODE, and cash, $USDC is the liquidity layer that makes the strategy actually executable. Buy $USDC at today’s price of ~$0.9999 on Binance today. Recap: As Twenty One Capital’s NYSE debut channels more TradFi money into Bitcoin, Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) , PEPENODE ($PEPENODE) , and USDC ($USDC) map out a coherent stack: programmable $BTC yield, speculative upside, and stable settlement.

This proactive move is to ensure a smooth and secure network upgrade for the Terra blockchain. Let’s break down exactly what this means for you and why it’s actually a positive step for the ecosystem. What is the Binance LUNA Suspension All About? Binance, one of the world’s largest cryptocurrency exchanges, will temporarily pause all deposit and withdrawal functions for Terra (LUNA). This is not an emergency measure or a reaction to market volatility. Instead, it’s a standard operational procedure to support an upcoming network upgrade on the Terra blockchain. The suspension is scheduled to begin at 12:05 p.m. UTC on December 8 . Trading of LUNA spot and margin pairs on Binance will not be affected during this period. Why Do Exchanges Like Binance Suspend Networks? Think of a blockchain network upgrade like updating the operating system on your phone. To install the new software safely and avoid errors or conflicts, all transactions need to be paused. Exchanges like Binance implement these suspensions to protect user funds. Here’s what happens during a Binance LUNA suspension : Safety First: It prevents users from sending funds to an old version of the chain, which could result in permanent loss. Network Integrity: It allows the Terra validators to upgrade their software and synchronize without interference from new transactions. Seamless Transition: Once the upgrade is complete and validated, Binance will reopen deposits and withdrawals on the new, upgraded network. What Should LUNA Users Do During the Suspension? Don’t panic. This is a routine event in the crypto world. However, a little planning goes a long way. Here are your actionable steps: Mark Your Calendar: Note the suspension time (Dec 8, 12:05 p.m. UTC). Complete any necessary deposits or withdrawals well before this deadline. Trading is Unaffected: Remember, you can still buy, sell, and trade LUNA on Binance spot and margin markets. The suspension only affects moving tokens on and off the exchange. Stay Informed: Follow official Binance announcements for the exact time when services will resume. They will provide an update once the upgrade is stable. This planned Binance LUNA suspension demonstrates the exchange’s commitment to operational security. It’s a responsible practice that prioritizes the safety of your assets above all else. Looking Beyond the Suspension: The Bigger Picture for Terra Network upgrades are a sign of a healthy, evolving blockchain. They often introduce improvements like enhanced security, faster transaction speeds, or new features. By supporting this upgrade, Binance is helping to ensure the Terra network remains robust and competitive. This temporary pause is a small price to pay for long-term network stability and innovation. Therefore, while inconvenient for a few hours, it ultimately benefits all LUNA holders and users of the Terra ecosystem. Conclusion: A Temporary Pause for Long-Term Gain In summary, the temporary Binance LUNA suspension is a standard, safety-focused procedure for a scheduled Terra network upgrade. It protects user funds and ensures a smooth transition. As a user, you simply need to plan your transactions around the brief window on December 8th. This event highlights the mature, procedural side of cryptocurrency infrastructure, where security and network health are paramount. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: Is my LUNA safe on Binance during the suspension? A1: Yes, absolutely. Your LUNA holdings in your Binance wallet are secure. The suspension only affects the ability to deposit new LUNA or withdraw existing LUNA from the platform. Q2: Can I still trade LUNA on Binance? A2: Yes. Trading for LUNA spot and margin pairs will continue as normal. The suspension only applies to deposit and withdrawal services on the Terra network. Q3: How long will the Binance LUNA suspension last? A3: Binance has not announced a specific end time. The suspension will last for the duration of the network upgrade and until the new chain is deemed stable. They will make a separate announcement when services resume. Q4: What happens if I send LUNA to Binance during the suspension? A4: You should not attempt this. Transactions sent during the suspension may not be credited and could be lost. Always wait for the official “resume” announcement from Binance. Q5: Will this affect the price of LUNA? A5: Planned technical suspensions like this one typically have minimal direct impact on price, as they are anticipated and routine. Market sentiment is more often driven by broader factors. Q6: Where can I get official updates? A6: Always refer to the official Binance Announcements page or their verified social media channels for the most accurate and timely information.

After the allocated tokens were sold, the team noted that most of the buying came from a bot farm, automating the purchases to end the event within minutes. HumidiFi launched its WET token, hoping for a fair distribution. Instead, the team noticed most of the tokens were sniped by a bot farm with specially funded wallets. The presale lasted only a few seconds, front-running all other eligible wallets. HumidiFi used Jupiter’s platform for the IDO, splitting the buyers into three eligible groups. However, this did not prevent a network of connected wallets to immediately connect to the smart contract and snipe all available tokens. The market maker, which added to the overall DEX volume on Solana, also noted that the sniping of WET may have gone to one single whale, defeating the plans for a democratic distribution. “For the public sale, a bot farm sniped the entire supply instantly and weterans were not able to participate,” explained the team through its X account. The token sale failed to reward previous point farmers and DeFi veterans on Solana. As a result, the HumidiFi team decided to launch a new token and discontinue the current version of WET. The presale will launch with a new token smart contract, allowing previous Solana DeFi users to claim the new asset. HumidiFi will launch new WET token after a repeated presale In total, the event was counted as successful, raising $1.39M in USDC, for a valuation of $69M at the initial presale price. The IDO was held in three stages, distributing one tranche of 60M tokens and two additional presales of 20M tokens, one for Jupiter stakers and one for a public presale. Whoever acquired the token in the initial sniping, may be left with a worthless asset. The HumidiFi team has not mention a refund for the deposits. The WET presale used Jupiter’s platform, which did not put up sufficient account filtering and bot defenses. WET caused significant hype, rising to $0.25 in pre-market trading. The premarket price then sank to $0.15, with much lower volumes. WET tokens rallied in pre-market trading, but fell again after HumidiFi announced the tokens had been sniped, and there would be another presale. | Source: Whales Market . Since WET was supposed to be unlocked immediately, the initial trading may have led to a further price drop. The tokens were preparing for a launch on Meteora, as well as the MEXC centralized exchange. WET tokens had to be distributed on December 9, but the new situation may delay the token generation event. Since the token was not created yet, there is no danger of competing assets with the same ticker. HumidiFi offers access to dark liquidity pools HumidiFi is different from other Solana DEX, as it offers access to dark liquidity pools. The exchange’s volumes and liquidity are not transparent, and the exchange has not published its fees. The HumidiFi approach aims to prevent sniping and front-running orders, which is one of the biggest problems for retail on Solana.

This bold step, aiming to raise at least $200 million, signals a pivotal moment of maturation and institutional acceptance for digital asset investment. Let’s break down what this means for investors and the broader market. What Does the HashKey Holdings Hong Kong IPO Mean for Crypto? According to a Bloomberg report, the Hong Kong-based crypto investment firm plans to begin its investor roadshow imminently. The target is a listing before the end of December, though the final size and timing hinge on market conditions. This HashKey Holdings Hong Kong IPO is more than just a fundraising event; it’s a powerful statement about the evolving regulatory and financial landscape for digital assets in a major global hub. Why Is This IPO Such a Big Deal? The planned HashKey Holdings Hong Kong IPO represents a significant vote of confidence. Hong Kong has been actively working to position itself as a friendly jurisdiction for crypto businesses, and a successful public listing for a major player like HashKey validates that strategy. For the average investor, it provides a rare, regulated avenue to gain exposure to the growth of the cryptocurrency ecosystem through a traditional stock market. Consider these key implications: Market Legitimacy: A successful IPO on a major exchange demonstrates that serious financial institutions view crypto-native firms as viable, long-term businesses. Regulatory Clarity: The process of going public requires rigorous financial disclosure and compliance, setting a new standard for transparency in the industry. Investor Access: It opens the door for traditional equity investors who may be hesitant to buy cryptocurrencies directly to participate in the sector’s growth. What Are the Potential Challenges for This IPO? However, the path is not without its hurdles. The success of the HashKey Holdings Hong Kong IPO depends heavily on current market sentiment. Cryptocurrency markets are notoriously volatile, and a downturn could affect investor appetite. Furthermore, the global macroeconomic environment, with factors like interest rates and geopolitical tensions, will play a crucial role in determining the final valuation and demand. Therefore, while the ambition is clear, the execution remains sensitive to external forces beyond the company’s control. This is a critical moment that will test the depth of institutional commitment to the crypto space. Actionable Insights for Observers and Investors For those watching this space, the HashKey Holdings Hong Kong IPO serves as a key indicator. A oversubscribed and successful listing could trigger a wave of similar moves from other crypto firms, further bridging the gap between digital and traditional finance. Conversely, a tepid response might signal that mainstream adoption still has roadblocks to overcome. If you’re considering the investment angle, remember to: Research HashKey’s business model, portfolio companies, and revenue streams thoroughly. Understand the specific risks associated with investing in a company tied to crypto asset volatility. Monitor the official prospectus for detailed financials and risk factors once released. The Final Verdict on HashKey’s Bold Move In conclusion, the upcoming HashKey Holdings Hong Kong IPO is a watershed event. It transcends a simple capital raise, acting as a litmus test for the institutionalization of cryptocurrency. A successful debut would not only fuel HashKey’s growth but also pave the way for greater legitimacy and structured investment opportunities in the digital asset world. All eyes will be on Hong Kong next week as this ambitious $200 million journey begins. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q: When will the HashKey Holdings IPO subscriptions open? A: Subscriptions are scheduled to open as early as next week, targeting a listing before the end of December 2024. Q: How much does HashKey aim to raise from its Hong Kong IPO? A: The company is targeting to raise at least $200 million from the public offering. Q: Why is Hong Kong a significant location for this crypto IPO? A: Hong Kong has been developing a progressive regulatory framework for digital assets, making it an attractive hub for crypto businesses seeking legitimacy and access to deep capital markets. Q: Can I invest in the HashKey IPO from outside Hong Kong? A: This depends on the final offering structure and your local brokerage’s access to the Hong Kong stock exchange. International investors should check with their brokers for eligibility. Q: What does HashKey Holdings do? A: HashKey Holdings is a cryptocurrency investment firm and ecosystem builder, involved in trading, venture capital, and blockchain infrastructure services within the digital asset space. Q: Is investing in a crypto company’s IPO riskier than a traditional IPO? A: Potentially, yes. While it offers regulated exposure, the underlying business is still tied to the highly volatile and evolving cryptocurrency market, which may present additional risks.

While BTC and cryptocurrencies had a rough start to December, they subsequently recovered quickly. However, this rapid market recovery wasn't reflected in US spot ETFs. While this is reflecting negatively at this point, spot Bitcoin ETFs also saw net outflows of $3.5 billion in November. According to Farside Investors data, spot Bitcoin ETFs in the US saw net outflows of $194.6 million on Thursday, the largest daily outflow in two weeks. BlackRock’s IBIT fund led the Bitcoin ETF outflows with $113 million, followed by Fidelity’s FBTC fund with $54.2 million. They are followed by VanEck’s HODL fund with $14.3 million, Grayscale’s GBTC fund with $10.1 million, and Bitwise’s BITB fund with $3 million outflow. In contrast to these outflows, Ark Invest’s ARKB fund, Invesco’s BTCO fund, Franklin Templeton’s EZBC fund, Valkyre’s BRRR fund, Wisdom Tree’s BTCW fund and Grayscale’s BTC fund recorded 0 inflows. Ethereum ETFs Also Experienced Outflows! Ethereum ETFs also saw outflows. Spot Ethereum ETFs saw a total net outflow of $41.5 million, according to data from Farside Investors. This means net inflows reversed direction after just one day. According to the data, Grayscale’s Ethereum Trust (ETHE) fund led the outflows with $31 million, followed by Grayscale’s Mini Ethereum (ETH) fund with $21 million and Fidelity’s FETH fund with $17.9 million. In contrast to these outflows, BlackRock's ETHA fund was the only fund to experience inflows, with an inflow of $28.4 million. VanEck's ETHV fund, Bitwise's ETHW fund, Invesco's QETH fund, 21Shares' TETH fund, and Franklin Templeton's EZET fund showed no net flows. Solana and XRP ETFs Experience Net Inflows! While Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs experienced net outflows, altcoin ETFs continued to see strong demand. According to the data, both US Solana (SOL) and XRP ETFs saw net inflows. US spot XRP ETFs saw a total of $12.84 million in net inflows during the day. Franklin's XRPZ fund saw the largest inflow with $5.70 million, while Bitwise's XRP fund saw $3.76 million and Grayscale's GXRP fund saw $2.04 million. US spot Solana ETFs saw net inflows totaling $4.59 million on the same day.

According to real-time data from Bitcoin World market monitoring, BTC is currently trading at $90,988.79 on the Binance USDT market. This movement has captured the attention of traders and investors worldwide, prompting questions about the underlying causes and potential future trajectory. What Does This Bitcoin Price Drop Mean for the Market? When the Bitcoin price makes a significant move, it often sets the tone for the entire digital asset ecosystem. A drop below a key psychological level like $91,000 can trigger several immediate reactions. Firstly, it may activate automated sell orders placed by traders, potentially accelerating the downward momentum. Secondly, it tests the conviction of long-term holders. However, seasoned analysts often view such pullbacks as healthy corrections within a larger trend, providing new entry points for investors who missed earlier rallies. Key Factors Influencing the Current BTC Valuation Several elements can contribute to short-term Bitcoin price volatility. While daily fluctuations are normal, understanding the context is crucial. Market Sentiment: Broader economic indicators, such as inflation data or central bank policies, can impact risk assets like Bitcoin. Technical Levels: The asset may have faced resistance near previous highs, leading to a natural retracement. On-Chain Activity: Shifts in network activity, like exchange inflows or outflows, can signal changing holder behavior. Liquidations: Sharp moves can liquidate highly leveraged positions in the derivatives market, adding to selling pressure. Therefore, while the current Bitcoin price of $90,988.79 is a key data point, it is just one part of a much larger and more complex financial picture. How Should Investors Navigate This Volatility? Market dips can be unsettling, but they also present strategic opportunities. The fundamental value proposition of Bitcoin—a decentralized, scarce digital asset—remains unchanged by daily price swings. For investors, this moment underscores the importance of core principles. Do Not Panic Sell: Emotional decisions during volatility often lead to selling at a loss. Review Your Strategy: Does this price action change your long-term thesis, or is it noise? Consider Dollar-Cost Averaging (DCA): Systematic buying at regular intervals can smooth out the impact of price volatility. Secure Your Assets: Ensure your BTC is held in a secure, self-custody wallet if you are not actively trading. Remember, the history of the Bitcoin price is a story of resilience through numerous corrections of much greater magnitude. The Road Ahead for Bitcoin’s Market Value Predicting the next move for the Bitcoin price is challenging, but analyzing support and resistance levels can provide clues. The area around $90,000 may now act as a critical support zone. A sustained hold above this level could be seen as a sign of strength, while a further breakdown might lead to a test of lower supports. Ultimately, Bitcoin’s long-term adoption trends, including institutional investment and technological developments like the Lightning Network, will play a far greater role in its future valuation than any single day’s trading range. In conclusion, today’s event where the Bitcoin price fell below $91,000 is a stark reminder of the asset’s inherent volatility. It separates short-term speculation from long-term conviction. For the informed participant, these moments are not just headlines; they are integral chapters in the ongoing story of digital finance. Staying educated, disciplined, and focused on fundamentals is the most reliable compass in these ever-changing markets. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Why did the Bitcoin price drop below $91,000? The price drop is likely due to a combination of factors including profit-taking after a rally, broader market sentiment, and the triggering of technical sell orders. Specific catalysts can include macroeconomic news or large sell orders on exchanges. Is this a good time to buy Bitcoin? For investors employing a dollar-cost averaging (DCA) strategy, a lower price can represent a better average entry point. However, “timing the market” is extremely difficult, and investment decisions should align with your individual financial goals and risk tolerance. How low could the Bitcoin price go? Predicting a bottom is speculative. Markets will seek natural support levels, which are price points where buying interest historically increases. Analysts watch key levels like $88,000 or $85,000, but these are not guarantees. Will this drop affect other cryptocurrencies? Typically, yes. Bitcoin is the market leader, and significant moves in its price often have a ripple effect across the entire crypto market, a phenomenon known as “Bitcoin dominance.” Altcoins frequently experience amplified volatility in these conditions. What is the long-term outlook for Bitcoin? Long-term proponents focus on Bitcoin’s fixed supply, growing institutional adoption, and its potential as a digital store of value. Short-term price volatility is considered normal within its long-term upward trend by many analysts. Where can I track the Bitcoin price reliably? Use reputable tracking websites and major exchange data. It’s wise to cross-reference prices from multiple sources like CoinMarketCap, CoinGecko, or the spot markets on trusted exchanges to get an accurate average.

The push targets nearly 13,800–14,000 sites suspected of tapping power without paying. Actions have included drone sweeps, meter inspections and on-the-ground raids. Task Force Launches Drone And Ground Sweeps Based on reports , a multi-agency task force was formed that includes the national utility Tenaga Nasional Berhad (TNB), police and other regulators. Drones fitted with thermal cameras and teams with special meters have been used to spot heat signatures and odd power draws in warehouses, shuttered shops and even residential blocks. Bitcoin mining hardware were seized in several operations and arrests were reported in at least a few cases where evidence of meter tampering was found. Illegal Bitcoin Mining: Estimated Losses And Numbers The scale is large. Reports have disclosed losses of about $1.1 billion, which is roughly RM 4.57 billion, and investigators say the number of illicit premises discovered since 2020 is close to 14,000. Authorities warned that power theft linked to mining has climbed sharply in recent years, with some sources pointing to an increase of about 300% since 2018. Many operators pick low-cost hiding spots and keep moving to avoid detection. Legal And Policy Questions Loom While Bitcoin mining itself is not outright banned in Malaysia, stealing power and bypassing meters is illegal under the Electricity Supply Act 1990. Officials are weighing tougher steps. Some lawmakers and energy officials have raised the option of stricter licensing, smarter metering or even temporary bans on certain operations if theft continues. Based on reports, the effort is meant to protect grid stability and stop long running losses that hit the utility’s bottom line. Safety Risks And Grid Strain Beyond the money, authorities say there are safety concerns. Tampered connections and overloaded lines raise the risk of short circuits and fires, and they can damage transformers and other costly equipment. In some areas, local residents reported flickering lights and unstable supply, which investigators link to abnormal draws found at nearby illegal mining sites. Those technical strains add urgency to enforcement. What Comes Next Reports suggest enforcement will rely on a mix of tech—drones, thermal scans, smart meters—and traditional policing. For now, the immediate goal is to shut down rigs, seize equipment and bring legal action against operators who took power without paying. The long term path may include clearer rules for legal miners and tighter monitoring across the grid.

55388230,https://timestabloid.com/?p=91429,1764928847,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/67/default.png,"Only Hours Left for This New Crypto Under $0.04, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Hits 96% Phase Allocation",https://timestabloid.com/only-hours-left-for-this-new-crypto-under-0-04-mutuum-finance/,"A rapidly accelerating token is now approaching a decisive moment as Phase 6 reaches 96% allocation. With only a limited supply left under the $0.04 mark, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is drawing heightened attention from investors tracking the final hours of this offering stage. Momentum has intensified as the project moves closer to major development milestones, and many believe this final stretch could become one of the most fast-moving phases yet. Mutuum Finance: Lending Tools Built for DeFi Usage Mutuum Finance is developing a decentralized lending platform designed to support predictable yield, transparent borrowing and strong risk controls. The protocol operates across two lending environments that serve different user needs. The first environment is its Peer-to-Contract lending model. Here, users supply assets into liquidity pools and receive mtTokens, which appreciate as borrowers repay interest. For example, if someone supplies stablecoins, the mtTokens they receive will increase in value over time as loan activity rises, creating APY tied directly to actual protocol usage. The second environment is its Peer-to-Peer lending market. Users can open isolated loan positions and choose between variable rates, which adjust based on pool demand, or stable rates, which offer predictable repayment terms. Loan-to-value limits help protect the protocol. Lower-volatility assets can support LTV ratios near 75%, while more volatile tokens remain closer to 35%–40%. When collateral drops too far, automated liquidations activate, allowing liquidators to purchase discounted collateral. This system helps prevent uncontrolled losses and maintains stability for lenders and borrowers. By combining P2C yield with P2P flexibility, Mutuum Finance aims to position itself as a DeFi crypto project built for real usage rather than hype-driven participation. Strong Presale Momentum as Allocation Tightens Mutuum Finance began its token launch in early 2025 at an entry point of $0.01, and interest has grown steadily ever since. As each stage opened, participation stayed strong, lifting the token’s price to its current level of $0.035. This marks a 250% rise during development and reflects ongoing confidence in the project rather than short bursts of speculation. To date, Mutuum Finance has collected more than $19M in support and now has a user base of over 18,300 holders, placing it among the most active early DeFi launches of the year. Out of the total 4B MUTM supply, 1.82B tokens were set aside for early buyers, representing 45.5% of the supply. More than 800M tokens from this allocation have already been claimed during the previous rounds. The offering is now deep into Phase 6, where allocation has climbed to 96%, reducing the remaining availability at the $0.035 price level to a very small fraction. As this stage moves toward completion, attention has intensified, especially with the token getting closer to its planned $0.06 launch value. The narrowing gap has pushed more users to monitor supply levels closely. A large part of Mutuum Finance’s community activity comes from its 24-hour leaderboard, a feature that rewards the top daily contributor with $500 in MUTM. This has kept participation consistent throughout the offering and encouraged new users to stay engaged. Onboarding is also streamlined thanks to direct card payments, making it easier for people entering the crypto space for the first time to participate without dealing with complicated processes. With allocation shrinking and the price still positioned under the $0.04 threshold, investor interest has accelerated. The pace of Phase 6 shows no signs of slowing, and users are increasingly aware that the remaining supply may not last long. V1 Testnet Launch and Security Layers According to the project’s official updates , V1 is scheduled to launch on the Sepolia Testnet in Q4 2025. The first version will include the liquidity pool, mtTokens, the liquidation bot, the debt-tracking token and support for ETH and USDT. This rollout will be the first opportunity for users to test the lending engine before mainnet deployment. Security has been one of Mutuum Finance’s strongest pillars. The project completed a CertiK audit, securing a 90/100 Token Scan score, and Halborn Security is reviewing the finalized contract architecture. This multi-layer audit approach helps ensure the protocol’s core functions are safe and stable ahead of public testing. Because of the project’s steady technical progress, several market observers suggest MUTM could see strong early movement after V1 is live. In a favorable environment, some analysts model an initial price range between $0.30 and $0.40, supported by early adoption and sustained borrowing activity. While these projections are not guaranteed, they reflect increasing interest in the platform’s long-term functionality. Rising Allocation Pressure Phase 6 of the Mutuum Finance offering has advanced at the fastest pace of any stage so far. With 96% already allocated, the remaining portion under $0.04 is expected to move quickly as buyers respond to the shrinking supply and upcoming V1 release. Recent whale entries have added additional pressure to the final phase. A $100K allocation earlier this week pushed Phase 6 closer to full completion. Large purchases at this point in an offering often signal confidence in the project’s roadmap and create more activity from smaller participants who do not want to miss the remaining allocation window. As the offering enters its final hours at this price level, user interest continues to rise, and many are monitoring Phase 6’s progression closely. With development, security reviews, stablecoin plans and testing milestones approaching, Mutuum Finance is positioning itself as a top crypto contender heading into 2026. Mutuum Finance’s offering has reached 96% allocation, the platform has raised more than $19M, and V1 is on schedule for Q4 2025. With mtToken yield, dual lending mechanics, strong security audits, stablecoin development and layer-2 plans, the project is creating significant traction in the DeFi space. With only a small amount of supply left at $0.035, the remaining hours of Phase 6 are shaping up to be the most active and closely watched stage of the offering so far.

Dogecoin Could Target $1.30 Trader Cryptollica posted a long-term monthly DOGE chart with the Mayer Multiple and a clear message: “DOGE Target > $1.30.” The Mayer Multiple, using 200- and 50-period moving averages with a 2.4 threshold, sits at 0.66005. Visually, that is far below the spikes above 5 that accompanied the 2017 and 2021 blow-off tops, indicating that Dogecoin is not yet in the overheated conditions historically associated with major market peaks. Cryptollica also highlighted an Alphractal chart titled “Dogecoin: Number of Days Spent at a Loss.” The series overlays DOGE’s price with a multicolour histogram of how long coins have been held in unrealised loss. Related Reading: Dogecoin Price Can Stage A 96% Rally If It Breaks This Falling Wedge Pattern Earlier cycle lows around 2014–2015 and the post-2021 unwind show extended peaks above roughly 1,200–1,500 days at a loss. In the latest segment, that metric has compressed back toward the lower end of the scale, resembling the early reset phases that preceded previous advances, and signalling that the proportion of long-suffering holders has markedly declined. DOGE On-Chain Data Looks Strong On the shorter-term on-chain side, Ali Martinez (@ali_charts) pointed to a sharp rebound in network activity. “Dogecoin just saw 71,589 active addresses. The biggest spike since September,” he wrote, sharing Glassnode data. The chart “DOGE: Number of Active Addresses” plots daily active addresses as yellow bars against the DOGE price in black. From early November, activity ranged around 45,000–47,500 addresses while price drifted lower from about $0.17 to $0.14. On December 3, active addresses jumped to 71,589 as price recovered to $0.15181709, signalling a broadening of participation rather than a purely price-driven move. Ali also drew attention to whale behaviour. Posting a Santiment chart of balances held by addresses with between 1,000,000 and 100,000,000 DOGE, he noted: “480 million Dogecoin bought by whales in 48 hours!” Related Reading: Is The Dogecoin Bottom In? This Price Level Could Be The Tell The grey area representing holdings in this band trends down from around 35.6 billion DOGE in mid-October to below 28 billion by late November while price falls from above $0.18 to about $0.135, indicating sustained distribution. In the final days of the chart, holdings rose again to roughly 28.45 billion as price rebounded from $0.14 to $0.15, confirming a renewed net accumulation phase among large holders. A third chart from Ali, “DOGE: Cost Basis Distribution Heatmap,” defines the next major technical hurdle. “$0.20 is the key resistance for Dogecoin. That’s where 11.72 billion $DOGE were accumulated,” he wrote. The Glassnode heatmap highlights a dense band between $0.20284609 and $0.20442947, with an annotated supply of 11,723,527,138.97 DOGE whose on-chain cost basis lies in that range. This cluster marks a heavy realised-price node where a large volume of coins moves from loss to breakeven as spot revisits $0.20, creating a clearly defined resistance zone. In combination, subdued valuation on the Mayer Multiple, a reset in “days at a loss,” the largest active-address spike since September, recent whale accumulation of 480 million DOGE and a well-defined $0.20 cost-basis wall form a favourable on-chain basis. Whether those higher levels are reached will depend on the market’s ability to absorb the 11.72 billion DOGE supply stacked around $0.20 and sustain the recent improvement in on-chain activity and large-holder demand. At press time, DOGE traded at $0.14451.

U.S. banks tapped the Federal Reserve for $13.5 billion through emergency repos. This move raised questions about the pace of liquidity entering the system. Ripple Bull Winkle (@RipBullWinkle), a cryptocurrency commentator, released a video that highlights this event. He focused on how rapid liquidity injections tend to lift assets with real utility. He argued that XRP sits in that category due to its supply structure and growing market interest. He pointed to the size of the overnight operation. He noted that this type of repo activity last appeared during periods of stress, such as the early 2000s and 2020. He said, “This only happens when someone behind the curtain is desperate for cash.” He argues that rapid liquidity shifts can change the direction of assets in long accumulation zones. He links this setup to a $250 XRP target. He believes the banking sector’s demand for fast cash shows a growing need for stable settlement mechanisms.

He said that “liquidity always moves first.” He believes that large holders have already begun to move into XRP . They expect a reaction once new capital passes through the system. He claimed that XRP benefits from a tight supply, consistent utility, and continuous integration into institutional discussions . He tied the liquidity spike to the possibility of a faster repricing phase for XRP. He pointed out that assets with defined supply limits respond first when the Federal Reserve increases short-term support. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 He suggested that XRP fits this category because its role in settlement corridors requires high volume capacity and reliability. In his view, rising institutional exposure adds to that momentum. He told viewers that this setup could support a long-term valuation shift. Why He Believes in the $250 Target He cited three factors. First, he believes the liquidity injection signals deeper issues inside the banking system. He says these conditions push investors toward assets they trust to settle value quickly. Second, he sees XRP’s supply structure as suitable for an aggressive price move . Third, he expects stronger institutional activity as more firms prepare for U.S. policy changes under a pro-crypto administration. President Donald Trump already confirmed the U.S. strategic digital reserve in early March. He named XRP as one of the included assets. Market participants treat this step as a sign that liquidity events may have a stronger effect on XRP than in previous cycles.

Crypto is so unthinkably huge at the moment, a nearly $4 trillion industry that’s aiming for world domination. Recent headlines talk of Circle and Mastercard planning to add USDC to global payment systems, Ethereum and Bitcoin treasuries in the billions of dollars, and Google building its own blockchain. Bitcoin has an all-time growth of over 180,000,000%, Dogecoin over 43,000%, and some of the newest presale coins often pump 10x, 100x, or even 1,000x on rare occasions.

Strategy’s Relentless Bitcoin Hoard Turns Bitcoin Hyper Into the Next Crypto to Explode December 5, 2025 • 10:00 UTC Strategy just reminded everyone how sticky corporate $BTC can be. The firm holds roughly $60B in $BTC, has $1.4B in cash, and no debt maturing until 2027, so it’s not being forced to dump coins after a 24.7% stock slide . That’s what Matt Hougan, Bitwise’s CIO is saying, at least. With $BTC trading around $92k, still about 24% above Strategy’s $74,4k cost basis, that stash behaves more like a long-term reserve than hot speculative supply. When big treasuries treat $BTC as untouchable collateral, upside liquidity shifts to the surrounding ecosystem where throughput and fees actually matter. Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) leans into that gap as a Bitcoin Layer-2 built on the Solana Virtual Machine, using a bridge so you can lock native $BTC and interact with DeFi and NFTs in seconds. Its native token $HYPER powers fees and staking, with optional burn mechanics that let holders tighten supply. With $29M already raised at $0.013375 per token, you’re stepping into a network that’s past the untested-idea stage but still early in its lifecycle. Learn all about the Bitcoin Hyper presale here. As Twenty One Capital Hits the NYSE, Bitcoin Hyper Lines Up as the Next Crypto to Explode December 5, 2025 • 10:00 UTC On December 9, 2025, Twenty One Capital starts trading on the NYSE under ticker XXI as the exchange’s largest dedicated Bitcoin treasury firm. The company is merging with Cantor Equity Partners and debuting with more than 43k $BTC on its balance sheet, roughly $4B at current prices, which makes it the third-largest public Bitcoin holder behind Marathon’s 52k $BTC and Strategy’s 650k-coin stack. This pushes Bitcoin deeper into traditional equity portfolios rather than just ETF wrappers. When balance-sheet $BTC moves onto Wall Street, on-chain demand tends to lag unless there is infrastructure that turns idle coins into productive liquidity. Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) targets that niche as the first Bitcoin Layer-2 built on the Solana Virtual Machine, with a bridge that wraps your $BTC for DeFi, NFTs, and payments. Transaction fees are paid in $HYPER, and staking lets you share in network activity while burns can shrink circulating supply. With $29M already raised at a presale price of $0.013375, your risk is now mostly about adoption. Read our Bitcoin Hyper price prediction for more.

55388312,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=231779,1764929111,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Critical Update: South Korean Police Launch Formal Probe into Upbit Hack,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/south-korea-police-upbit-hack-probe/,"BitcoinWorld Critical Update: South Korean Police Launch Formal Probe into Upbit Hack In a significant escalation, South Korean authorities have moved decisively on a major cryptocurrency security breach. The National Police Agency has now launched a formal investigation into the Upbit hack , converting what was a preliminary review into a full-fledged criminal probe. This move signals the seriousness with which officials are treating the incident and highlights the ongoing global battle to secure digital assets. What Does the Formal Upbit Hack Investigation Mean? The transition from a preliminary review to a formal investigation is a crucial legal step. According to a police official speaking to the Herald Business, this shift occurs when “criminal suspicions become objectively concrete and a full probe is deemed necessary.” Importantly, the official clarified that this does not always require a suspect to be identified first, which is common in complex cybercrime cases. The Cyber Terror Investigation Division, a specialized unit, has been leading the inquiry since last month. This formal status grants investigators broader powers, including the ability to: Compel the production of evidence and records. Execute search warrants more readily. Dedicate more resources to tracing the digital footprint of the attack. Why is the Upbit Hack Probe So Secretive? If you’re wondering why details are scarce, you’re not alone. The police have been tight-lipped, refusing to confirm if any suspects have been identified. A police official directly addressed this, stating they “could not disclose whether a suspect has been identified, citing the nature of hacking cases.” This secrecy is standard protocol. Revealing investigative tactics or leads could alert perpetrators, allowing them to cover their tracks or flee. The Upbit hack probe now joins a list of high-profile crypto exchange investigations in South Korea, a nation at the forefront of digital asset adoption. Therefore, the outcome will be closely watched by regulators and investors worldwide, as it could set precedents for how such crimes are prosecuted. What Are the Broader Implications for Crypto Security? This formal investigation into the Upbit hack is more than just a news headline; it’s a stark reminder of the persistent vulnerabilities in the crypto ecosystem. Exchanges remain prime targets for sophisticated hackers. For users, this event reinforces critical security practices: Use Hardware Wallets: For significant holdings, move assets off exchanges into cold storage. Enable All Security Features: Always use two-factor authentication (2FA). Stay Informed: Follow reputable sources for news on exchange stability and security audits. The proactive response by South Korean police also demonstrates a growing institutional capability to tackle crypto-related crime. This could deter future attacks and help build long-term trust in regulated markets. Conclusion: A Pivotal Moment for Accountability The launch of a formal police probe into the Upbit hack marks a pivotal moment. It moves the incident from the realm of technical failure into the arena of criminal justice, seeking accountability. While the path to identifying and prosecuting the hackers will be complex, this decisive action sends a powerful message: targeting cryptocurrency exchanges carries serious legal consequences. The global crypto community will be watching as this investigation unfolds, hoping for a resolution that strengthens security standards for everyone. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q: What exactly happened in the Upbit hack? A> While specific technical details from the latest probe are confidential, the incident involved unauthorized access to the Upbit cryptocurrency exchange’s systems, leading to a loss of funds. The formal investigation aims to uncover the full scope and method of the attack. Q: Has Upbit reimbursed its users? A> Upbit has a history of covering user losses from past security incidents from its own reserves. However, specific details regarding reimbursement for this particular event should be confirmed through official Upbit announcements. Q: How long will this formal investigation take? A> Cybercrime investigations can be lengthy, often taking months or even years. The complexity of tracing blockchain transactions and identifying perpetrators behind sophisticated attacks means patience is required. Q: Should I be worried about using Upbit now? A> The fact that a formal police investigation is underway shows the issue is being taken seriously. However, users should always practice personal security diligence, regardless of the exchange, by using strong passwords, 2FA, and considering cold storage for large amounts. Q: What does this mean for crypto regulation in South Korea? A> This probe will likely intensify regulatory scrutiny on exchange security protocols. It may lead to stricter mandatory security standards and compliance requirements for all operating exchanges in the country. Q: Can the stolen cryptocurrency be recovered? A> It is challenging but not impossible. If investigators can trace the stolen funds to specific wallets and identify the individuals controlling them, there is a possibility of recovery through legal seizure. However, hackers often use advanced techniques to launder and obscure the trail. Found this deep dive into the formal Upbit hack investigation insightful?

Three people who know about the plans say that the business just finished raising money from investors and is now worth 21 billion yuan, which equals $2.97 billion. The planned stock sale happens as China works to build its own chip industry. The United States has put limits on selling advanced computer chips to China, so Beijing wants Chinese companies to make their own versions. Several other Chinese chip makers are also looking to go public soon. Investor interest in AI chip companies is running high right now. On Friday, Moore Threads started trading on the Shanghai Stock Exchange and its shares shot up to more than five times what investors paid in the initial offering. Moore Threads makes graphics processing units that power artificial intelligence systems. According to documents that Reuters looked at, Kunlunxin wants to finish its stock sale by early 2027. Two people familiar with the situation said the company is telling people it plans to file the paperwork with the Hong Kong Stock Exchange as soon as the first three months of 2026. Recent funding round boosts valuation Kunlunxin wrapped up its most recent round of funding within the last six months. The company brought in more than 2 billion yuan from a China Mobile investment fund and other private backers, according to three different sources. This funding round put the company’s value at about 21 billion yuan, which is higher than the 18 billion yuan from the previous time it raised money. The people who shared this information asked not to be named because the company has not made it public yet. Why are Chinese chip companies desperate to go public? Making chips at home has become important for China because the U.S. government has blocked the sale of Nvidia’s newest chips to Chinese buyers. Kunlunxin is joining other Chinese chip companies that want to sell shares to the public. After Moore Threads started trading, another company called MetaX should begin trading in the next few weeks. Biren Technology, which the U.S. has put on a blacklist, is also planning to list in Hong Kong. Baidu set up Kunlunxin in 2012 as an internal team to develop AI chips. The unit now operates on its own, though Baidu still owns the controlling share. At first, Kunlunxin only made chips for Baidu’s needs. But over the last two years, it has started selling to other customers as Chinese tech giants reduce reliance on foreign chips. The investment documents show that Kunlunxin expects to bring in more than 3.5 billion yuan in revenue this year and not lose money. Last year, in 2024, the company lost about 200 million yuan while making around 2 billion yuan in revenue. This year, more than half of what it makes should come from selling to outside customers, two sources said. Latest product line gains market traction The company’s best chip, called the P800, has been selling well this year. Most buyers are state-owned companies and government offices that are building data centers. Last month, Kunlunxin showed off two new chip products. The M100 focuses on running AI programs and will come out in early 2026. The M300 can both train and run AI systems and is set for early 2027. When news of the listing plans came out on Friday, Baidu’s stock price in Hong Kong jumped up as much as 7.8%. The surge in Hong Kong listings reflects a broader trend of Chinese companies choosing the Asian financial hub over U.S. markets for their public debuts. If you're reading this, you’re already ahead.

The firm pulled 5,805 BTC, worth approximately $470 million, from the Binance exchange within a single day. This massive transfer isn’t just a routine transaction; it’s a powerful signal that could hint at the strategic intentions of a major market player. Let’s dive into what this means for Bitcoin and the broader market landscape. What Does This Massive Bitcoin Withdrawal Signal? When a large entity moves funds off a centralized exchange, analysts typically interpret it as a bullish, long-term holding strategy. This specific Bitcoin withdrawal by Matrixport is one of the largest single movements observed recently. The logic is straightforward: you don’t withdraw half a billion dollars in Bitcoin to trade it minutes later. This action suggests a deliberate shift from a trading asset to a stored asset, often referred to as a ‘cold storage’ move. Therefore, this reduces the immediate selling pressure on the market. The Bitcoin is effectively taken out of the circulating supply readily available on the exchange’s order books. For investors, this can be seen as a vote of confidence in Bitcoin’s long-term value, especially coming from a regulated institution like Matrixport. Why Are Institutional Bitcoin Withdrawals So Important? Institutional moves carry significant weight. They are closely watched because they often reflect sophisticated market analysis and risk assessment. A large-scale Bitcoin withdrawal from an exchange like Binance can influence market sentiment in several key ways: Supply Shock Precursor: It physically reduces the liquid supply of Bitcoin on exchanges, which can amplify price movements if demand increases. Sentiment Indicator: It acts as a leading indicator, showing that smart money may be positioning for a period of accumulation rather than distribution. Network Health: Large withdrawals to private wallets demonstrate active participation and security confidence in the Bitcoin network itself. Moreover, this event highlights the growing maturity of crypto custodial services. Institutions now have secure, trusted options for holding their own keys, moving beyond reliance on exchange wallets. Decoding the Impact: What’s Next for BTC? While a single event doesn’t dictate a market’s direction, it adds a crucial piece to the puzzle. This Bitcoin withdrawal occurs amidst a complex macroeconomic backdrop. It prompts several critical questions for traders and long-term holders alike. Does Matrixport know something the wider market doesn’t? Are they simply rebalancing their custodial arrangements, or is this a strategic accumulation phase? Historically, periods of high exchange withdrawals have often preceded phases of price consolidation or upward trends, as supply becomes scarcer on trading venues. However, it’s essential to consider this data point alongside other on-chain metrics, such as miner behavior and wallet activity, to form a complete picture. Actionable Insights for Crypto Investors So, what can the average investor learn from this monumental Bitcoin withdrawal ? First, it underscores the importance of monitoring on-chain data. Platforms that track whale movements and exchange flows provide invaluable, real-time insight into what large players are doing. Second, it reinforces a core principle of sound crypto investing: self-custody. While not everyone has $470 million to move, the philosophy is the same. Controlling your private keys is the ultimate form of financial sovereignty in the digital asset space. This move by a major institution validates that approach. In conclusion, Matrixport’s $470 million Bitcoin withdrawal from Binance is more than just a large transaction. It is a significant on-chain event that underscores a shift towards long-term holding by institutional players. This action reduces readily available supply and broadcasts a strong signal of confidence in Bitcoin’s fundamental value proposition. For the market, it’s a reminder that beneath the daily price volatility, foundational moves are being made that could shape the asset’s trajectory for months to come. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: Why is withdrawing Bitcoin from an exchange considered bullish? A: Withdrawing Bitcoin to a private wallet typically indicates an intent to hold for the long term (HODL), reducing the immediate sell-side pressure on exchange order books and signaling confidence in future value. Q2: Does this mean the price of Bitcoin will go up immediately? A: Not necessarily. While it’s a positive on-chain signal, price is influenced by many factors. This move suggests accumulation, but immediate price action depends on broader market sentiment, macroeconomic conditions, and overall demand. Q3: What is Matrixport? A: Matrixport is a Asia-based one-stop financial services platform for cryptocurrencies, offering trading, lending, structured products, and asset management services primarily to institutional and professional investors. Q4: How can I track large Bitcoin movements like this? A: You can use on-chain analytics platforms and blockchain explorers that monitor whale wallets and exchange flows. These tools provide data on large transfers, exchange inflows/outflows, and wallet accumulation. Q5: Should I withdraw my Bitcoin from exchanges too? A> If you are holding Bitcoin as a long-term investment and not actively trading, moving it to a secure, self-custody hardware or software wallet is a best practice for security and true ownership. Always ensure you understand how to securely store your private keys. Q6: What’s the difference between an exchange withdrawal and a transfer between wallets? A: A withdrawal from an exchange means assets are moved from the exchange’s custodial wallet to an external, user-controlled address. A transfer between private wallets is just a movement between two non-custodial addresses on the blockchain. Found this analysis of the major Bitcoin withdrawal insightful?

These sharp declines were seen by some whales as buying opportunities and they made additional purchases. At this point, a whale also bought Ethereum (ETH) and seven other altcoins. According to Lookonchain's post, the whale, taking advantage of the drop, bought a total of $35.7 million worth of eight different altcoins. The whale, who made his biggest purchase in Ethereum, also purchased Chainlink (LINK), Ethena (ENA), AAVE, Ondo Finance (ONDO), Uniswap (UNI), SKY and LDO, in addition to ETH. The whale moved these altcoins on-chain to the 0xBC64 wallet. “Accordingly, the whale bought 3,175 ETH ($10.13 million), 557,937 LINK ($7.99 million), 20.14 million ENA ($5.82 million), 25,396 AAVE ($4.9 million), 6.53 million ONDO ($3.27 million), 340,849 UNI ($2.05 million), 22.59 million SKY ($1.09 million), 384,075 LDO ($244,000). “ While this whale made a basket of altcoins with Ethereum and seven other assets, another whale staked the 24,000 ETH he bought at $2,529 five months ago instead of selling it. This whale's unrealized profits reached over $55 million, but he didn't sell. His current profits have fallen from the peak to $14.4 million. *This is not investment advice.

A compelling Ethereum price analysis is making waves, suggesting the second-largest cryptocurrency is mirroring the exact pattern that launched its legendary 2021 bull run. This technical setup points toward a potential surge that could redefine market expectations. Let’s dive into the details and explore what this could mean for your portfolio. What Does This Ethereum Price Analysis Reveal? Crypto analyst Mags has identified a critical pattern in the ETH/BTC trading pair. According to his Ethereum price analysis , the pair bottomed in April at a level identical to its low point in the previous bull cycle. This isn’t just a minor coincidence; it’s a foundational signal that technical analysts watch closely. The subsequent price action has followed the historical script, with a rebound and a retest of key support levels. This pattern alignment suggests the market structure is preparing for a significant move, much like it did three years ago. Could We Really See a 170% Surge? The most eye-catching part of this Ethereum price analysis is the projected target. Mags highlights that ETH is now approaching the same juncture that, in 2021, preceded a staggering 170% rally over just seven weeks. This historical move consisted of seven consecutive weekly green candles before a period of consolidation. If this fractal pattern repeats, the math is straightforward: a similar percentage gain from current levels would propel Ethereum’s price to approximately $8,500. This projection isn’t based on hype but on a measurable, repeatable chart pattern observed by a seasoned analyst. Why Should Traders Pay Attention Now? This Ethereum price analysis offers more than just a price target; it provides a potential roadmap. Understanding these patterns helps traders and investors make informed decisions. However, it’s crucial to remember that past performance never guarantees future results. The crypto market is influenced by numerous factors, including: Macroeconomic conditions like interest rates and inflation. Network developments , such as Ethereum protocol upgrades. Overall market sentiment and Bitcoin’s dominance. Regulatory news that can impact the entire sector. Therefore, while the technical setup is bullish, a holistic view of the market is essential. What Are the Risks in This Bullish Forecast? Every optimistic Ethereum price analysis must be balanced with a dose of reality. The primary risk is that the pattern fails to execute. Markets are fractal but not perfectly predictable. A break below the recently retested support levels could invalidate the bullish thesis. Furthermore, the crypto landscape in 2024 is different from 2021, with new institutional players and evolving regulations that could alter market dynamics. Investors should use this analysis as one tool among many, not as a sole decision-making guide. Actionable Insights from the Pattern For those monitoring this Ethereum price analysis , here are practical steps to consider: Monitor the ETH/BTC pair: Its strength is a key indicator of Ethereum’s standalone momentum. Watch for weekly closes: Consecutive green weekly candles would be a strong confirmation signal. Set clear risk parameters: Define your entry, exit, and stop-loss levels before the volatility potentially increases. Diversify your research: Complement technical analysis with fundamental news about Ethereum’s adoption and usage. Conclusion: A Compelling Case for Optimism In summary, the current Ethereum price analysis drawing parallels to 2021 presents a fascinating and potentially lucrative scenario. The alignment of key bottoming patterns and support retests builds a credible case for a major upward move. While a surge to $8,500 is the dramatic headline, the true value for savvy market participants lies in recognizing these high-probability setups and managing their strategy accordingly. The coming weeks will be critical in determining if this historical echo transforms into a new rally for the ages. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What is the main evidence for this Ethereum price prediction? A1: The analysis is based on a technical pattern where the ETH/BTC trading pair bottomed at the same level as in the 2021 cycle and has followed a similar rebound and retest structure, suggesting a repeat of the historical rally. Q2: How long did the similar 2021 rally take to play out? A2: The 2021 surge that this pattern references involved a 170% gain over a period of approximately seven weeks, marked by seven consecutive weekly gains. Q3: Is technical analysis alone reliable for crypto investing? A3: No. While technical analysis like this Ethereum price analysis can identify trends and potential setups, it should be used alongside fundamental analysis, an understanding of market sentiment, and proper risk management. Q4: What could invalidate this bullish Ethereum price analysis? A4: A decisive break below the recently tested support levels on the ETH/BTC chart would weaken the bullish pattern. Additionally, severe negative macroeconomic or regulatory news could override technical signals. Q5: Where can I follow updates on this analysis? A5: The original analysis was noted by Cointelegraph, referencing analyst Mags. For ongoing updates, follow reputable crypto news outlets and technical analysis channels. Q6: Should I invest based solely on this pattern? A6: Absolutely not. This analysis highlights a possibility, not a certainty. Always conduct your own thorough research, consider your financial goals and risk tolerance, and never invest more than you can afford to lose.

But growing worries about sky-high technology prices could slow things down. Deals involving Asian stocks, including new company listings, follow-up sales, and convertible bonds, reached $267 billion through this year. That marks a 15% jump from 2024 and the first year-over-year increase since 2021, according to data from LSEG viewed by Reuters. Hong Kong has been the clear winner among listing locations. Chinese firms raised $75 billion there in 2025, more than three times what they brought in last year. It’s the highest amount since 2021, the data revealed. India collected $19.3 billion from new stock listings this year, LSEG numbers showed. That’s down 6% from the record $20.5 billion seen in 2024. The tally doesn’t count the $604 million offering from online shopping site Meesho happening this week. “China’s recovery and India’s continued expansion have been the twin engines driving equity issuance across Asia this year,” James Wang from Goldman Sachs said. He runs the firm’s Asian stock deals outside Japan. “We expect both markets to remain central to regional deal flow in 2026,” Wang added. “We are still in the early stages of a broader upswing … supported by Asia’s economic growth and improving corporate earnings.” Major deals expected in 2026 Looking ahead, India might pull in as much as $20 billion from company debuts in 2026, Equirus Capital predicted. More than 300 businesses have submitted paperwork for Hong Kong listings , public records show. Big offerings like India’s Reliance Jio Platforms debut and the Hong Kong listing of China’s Zhongji Innolight Co. should push volumes much higher in 2026, advisers said. Asia has gained as investors worldwide spread their money around more. Many have moved away from U.S. holdings lately because of uncertainty about President Donald Trump’s trade and foreign policy plans. Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index has climbed nearly 30% this year, doing better than major U.S. benchmarks. India’s main index is up about 10.8%. Taking advantage of good conditions, Chinese battery maker CATL pulled in $5.3 billion with a Hong Kong listing. Zijin Gold International brought in $3.5 billion from its debut. Both rank among the world’s biggest offerings this year. SK Hynix chairman weighs in on AI bubble debate Wild swings in U.S. stocks during November exposed problems with the global rush into artificial intelligence investments. Questions arose about whether markets had gotten caught up in a speculative bubble ready to burst. Concerns about extreme prices come as Chinese AI developers Zhipu AI and MiniMax, plus chip makers MetaX and Kunlunxin , plan their own listings. These deals could total billions of dollars. Meanwhile, the chairman of the South Korean conglomerate that owns leading memory chipmaker SK Hynix said artificial intelligence stocks could come under pressure after rising too fast and too much, but the industry is not in a bubble. Concerns about lofty AI stock valuations have begun to weigh on broader financial markets, while there are questions about when huge AI investments will translate into actual profits. “I don’t see a bubble in (the AI industry),” SK Group chairman Chey Tae-won said at a forum in Seoul when asked by the Bank of Korea governor about concerns over AI bubbles. “But when you look at the stock markets, they rose too fast and too much, and I think it is natural that there could be some period of corrections,” he said, adding that AI stocks have been climbing beyond their fundamental value. Chey said “overshooting” in stock valuations is not new for a growth industry, and the development of AI would lead to significant productivity gains. Shares in SK Hynix , which supplies high-end memory chips to power Nvidia’s powerful AI chipsets, surged 214% over one year, propelled by robust demand for its products from AI data center builders, which are investing trillions of dollars. The South Korean company reported in October another record quarterly profit, driven by the AI boom, and said it has sold out all its chip production for next year, expecting an extended chip “super cycle.” Get seen where it counts.

According to an incident report from the USPD team’s official X account, the attacker deposited roughly 3,122 ETH as collateral and exploited a bug that allowed them to mint approximately 98 million USPD tokens in a single transaction. The process created ten times the amount of tokens against the initial deposit and enabled the hacker to drain an additional 237 stETH collateral. The stolen stablecoins were subsequently converted into about $300,000 worth of USDC through decentralized exchange Curve. The USPD protocol developers and several cybersecurity accounts, like PeckShield Alert, issued a warning to users immediately after identifying the breach, saying : “We have confirmed a critical exploit of the USPD protocol resulting in unauthorized minting and liquidity draining. Please DO NOT buy USPD. Revoke all approvals immediately.” USPD hacker took advantage of proxies to trick protocol into minting The DeFi protocol’s report mentioned that the breach exploited a complex attack vector named “CPIMP,” short for Clandestine Proxy In the Middle of Proxy. USPD explained the attacker front-ran the proxy initialization on September 16 during deployment using a Multicall3 transaction. 2/ This was not a flaw in our smart contract logic. The USPD protocol underwent rigorous security audits by top-tier firms @NethermindEth and Resonance. Our code is fully unit-tested and adheres to strict industry standards. The logic itself remains secure. — USPD.IO | The Dollar of the Decentralized Nation (@USPD_io) December 4, 2025 The hacker used CPIMP to seize administrative rights silently before the protocol’s scripts were fully executed, waiting for months to start minting coins without authorization. They implemented a “shadow” contract that forwarded calls to USPD’s audited code, then subtly implemented an event payload manipulation and storage slot spoofing to deceive Etherscan into displaying the original audited contract. “This camouflage allowed the attacker to hide in plain sight for months, bypassing verification tools and manual checks. Today, they used their hidden access to upgrade the proxy, mint ~98M USPD, drain ~232 stETH,” USPD wrote. Blockchain analyst Emmet Gallic reiterated the DeFi protocol’s analysis, adding that a proxy initialization caused the attack during deployment. “The attacker claimed admin rights, installed a shadow implementation that spoofed Etherscan into showing the audited contract. The protocol was hacked for months,” he surmised. USPD to continue with investigations, pledges bounty to hacker In response to the attack, USPD stated that it is working closely with law enforcement and whitehat security groups to trace and freeze the stolen funds. “We have flagged the attacker’s addresses with all major CEXs and DEXs to freeze the flow of funds,” the team revealed. The protocol also said it was willing to resolve the situation with the attacker if the funds are returned minus a standard 10% bug bounty. The protocol promised to cease all law enforcement actions if they accepted the offer and encouraged the attacker to contact them directly or return 90% of the stolen assets to see the matter resolved. “We are devastated that despite rigorous audits and adherence to best practices, we fell victim to this emerging and highly complex attack vector. We are doing everything in our power to recover assets,” USPD told its community. According to CoinMarketCap, the stablecoin’s peg to the greenback hasn’t been affected so far, but its volume has dropped by 20% within the last 24 hours to around $2.56 million. DeFi stablecoin protocol breaches were once much bigger than what USPD faced, including a Euler Finance hack in 2023 that led to more than $197 million in losses after stablecoins were drained from its lending pools. Two DeFi protocols in recovery mode after November exploits Last Monday, Yearn Finance became the latest protocol to suffer an exploit on its liquid-staking index token yETH. The perpetrator minted an effectively unlimited number of tokens and stole about $3 million in ETH. Yearn Finance had previously suffered a $9 million exploit in its yETH stableswap pool on November 30, but as Cryptopolitan reported on Wednesday, it has already begun recovering stolen funds. So far, the team has successfully reclaimed $2.39 million, which will be returned to affected depositors. Balancer, another DeFi protocol that lost $128 million through a v2 breach, announced plans to reimburse approximately $8 million to liquidity providers last week.

This move signals a major evolution for the platform, aiming to trade directly with users to supercharge liquidity and stability. For anyone engaged in crypto and prediction markets, this development is a powerful indicator of the sector’s rapid maturation. Let’s explore what this means for Polymarket and its users. What Does Polymarket’s New Market-Making Team Actually Do? Simply put, a market maker provides liquidity. They continuously offer to buy and sell assets, ensuring users can execute trades quickly and at fair prices. Currently, Polymarket likely relies on external firms for this function. By bringing this capability in-house , Polymarket gains direct control over a critical part of its trading engine. The company is actively hiring for this unit and talking to experienced traders and sports bettors, suggesting a focus on deep, niche expertise. Why Is This a Strategic Power Move for Polymarket? This initiative is far more than an operational tweak. It’s a core strategic play with significant potential benefits. Firstly, an internal Polymarket market-making team can tailor its strategies precisely to the platform’s unique prediction contracts, potentially offering tighter spreads than generic external providers. Secondly, it enhances reliability; the platform is no longer solely dependent on third-party liquidity, which can be volatile. Finally, it represents a major step towards professionalization, building institutional-grade infrastructure that could attract more serious capital and complex markets. However, challenges exist. Running a successful market-making operation requires sophisticated risk management and significant capital. Polymarket must navigate the inherent conflict of interest where it acts as both platform operator and a key trading participant, requiring transparent governance. How Will Users Benefit from This Change? For the everyday trader on Polymarket, this move should translate to a tangibly better experience. The primary user benefits are expected to be: Improved Liquidity: Faster trade execution with less slippage, especially for smaller or newer markets. Tighter Spreads: The difference between buy and sell prices should narrow, making trading more cost-effective. Market Stability: Consistent liquidity can dampen extreme volatility caused by large, one-sided bets. New Market Potential: With dedicated liquidity support, Polymarket could confidently launch more niche or high-stakes prediction events. What Does This Signal for the Future of Prediction Markets? Polymarket’s plan is a clear sign that prediction markets are moving beyond their experimental phase. Building an in-house market-making team is an infrastructure investment typical of mature financial platforms. It indicates a long-term commitment to scaling and legitimizing the space. This move could pressure competitors to enhance their own liquidity solutions, driving industry-wide innovation. Moreover, it blurs the lines between traditional finance’s market structure and decentralized prediction platforms, suggesting a fascinating convergence. Conclusion: A Calculated Bet on Self-Reliance Polymarket’s decision to launch its own market-making arm is a calculated bet on self-reliance and superior user experience. While not without its complexities, this strategic pivot aims to cement the platform’s liquidity, stability, and competitive edge. It reflects a broader trend in crypto and DeFi where leading protocols internalize critical functions to control their destiny and better serve their communities. The success of this Polymarket market-making team will be closely watched as a benchmark for the entire prediction economy. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) What is a market-making team? A market-making team provides liquidity by continuously offering to buy and sell assets on a trading platform. Their role is to ensure there is always a counterparty for trades, which makes markets function smoothly. Why would Polymarket want its own market-making team? An in-house team allows Polymarket to have direct control over liquidity, potentially offering better prices (tighter spreads) and more reliable trading for its users, especially in niche prediction markets. Will this make trading on Polymarket cheaper? Potentially, yes. A dedicated, efficient market-making team should reduce the “spread”—the difference between buying and selling prices—which is a core cost of trading. Does this create a conflict of interest for Polymarket? It introduces a scenario where Polymarket operates the platform and participates as a trader. Managing this requires clear rules and transparent operations to ensure fair play for all users, which will be crucial for maintaining trust. When is the Polymarket market-making team expected to launch? While no official date has been announced, reports indicate Polymarket is currently in hiring and planning phases, suggesting a launch could happen in the coming months. How does this affect other prediction market platforms? Polymarket’s move raises the bar for liquidity and user experience. It may push competing platforms to develop similar in-house capabilities or partner with stronger liquidity providers to stay competitive.

Remember when Terra Classic (LUNC) was one of the most talked-about cryptocurrencies in the market? The dramatic collapse of the Terra ecosystem in 2022 left many investors wondering if there was any hope for recovery. Today, as we look toward 2025 and beyond, the question on everyone’s mind is clear: Can LUNC price reclaim the $0.0007 level that once seemed so distant? This comprehensive Terra Classic price prediction examines the factors that could drive LUNC’s future trajectory and whether this controversial token can stage a remarkable comeback. Understanding Terra Classic’s Current Position Terra Classic, originally known as Terra (LUNA), underwent a significant transformation following the collapse of its algorithmic stablecoin UST. The original blockchain split into Terra 2.0 and Terra Classic, with LUNC representing the legacy chain. Despite the catastrophic events of 2022, the Terra Classic community has shown resilience, implementing various mechanisms to potentially restore value. The current LUNC price sits at a fraction of its previous highs, but several factors could influence its future direction: Community-driven development and governance Token burning mechanisms to reduce supply Exchange support and trading volume Overall cryptocurrency market conditions Terra Classic Price Prediction 2025: The First Major Test Looking ahead to 2025, our Terra Classic price prediction considers both technical and fundamental factors. The year 2025 could represent a crucial turning point for LUNC, as it will have had several years to implement recovery mechanisms and rebuild trust within the cryptocurrency community. Key factors that could influence LUNC price in 2025 include: Factor Potential Impact Probability Successful token burns Significant supply reduction Medium Major exchange listings Increased liquidity and access High Ecosystem development Utility restoration Low-Medium Market-wide bull run General altcoin appreciation High Based on current trends and potential developments, a realistic LUNC price prediction for 2025 ranges between $0.0002 and $0.0004. Reaching $0.0007 would require exceptional circumstances, such as massively successful token burns combined with a strong overall cryptocurrency market. LUNC Price Trajectory Through 2026-2030 Extending our cryptocurrency forecast beyond 2025 reveals a more complex picture. The years 2026 through 2030 will test whether Terra Classic can establish sustainable value or remains a speculative asset. Our analysis suggests that LUNC’s path will depend heavily on several critical factors. For the LUNC recovery to gain momentum through 2026-2030, the following conditions would need to be met: Sustained Development: Continuous improvement of the Terra Classic blockchain and ecosystem Community Growth: Expanding the user and developer base beyond current levels Market Positioning: Finding a unique value proposition in an increasingly competitive cryptocurrency landscape Regulatory Clarity: Navigating evolving cryptocurrency regulations successfully Will LUNC Price Reclaim $0.0007? The Critical Analysis The central question of whether LUNC can reach $0.0007 requires examining both the challenges and opportunities. From a purely mathematical perspective, reaching this level would represent a substantial increase from current prices, requiring either significant supply reduction or massive demand increase. Several scenarios could lead to LUNC achieving this price target: Aggressive Token Burns: If the community successfully implements and sustains aggressive token burning mechanisms, reducing supply dramatically Major Partnership Announcements: Strategic partnerships that bring substantial utility and users to the Terra Classic ecosystem Market Sentiment Shift: A broader shift in how the market perceives “failed” projects and their potential for recovery Technological Breakthrough: Development of unique features or applications that differentiate Terra Classic from other blockchains Cryptocurrency Forecast: Comparing LUNC with Other Recovery Stories History provides several examples of cryptocurrencies that have staged remarkable recoveries after significant setbacks. While each situation is unique, examining these cases can provide context for our Terra Classic price prediction. Notable recovery stories in cryptocurrency history include: Bitcoin’s recovery from multiple 80%+ drawdowns Ethereum’s resilience through various challenges Smaller altcoins that found new utility and community support What distinguishes LUNC’s situation is the scale of the original collapse and the ongoing community dedication to revival. This unique combination makes the Terra Classic 2025 outlook particularly interesting for cryptocurrency analysts and investors. Risks and Challenges for Terra Classic’s Future No cryptocurrency forecast would be complete without considering potential risks. For Terra Classic, these challenges are particularly significant given the project’s history. Major risks to our LUNC price prediction include: Risk Category Specific Challenges Potential Impact Technical Security vulnerabilities, development stagnation High Market Low liquidity, competition from newer projects Medium-High Regulatory Increased scrutiny of “failed” projects Medium Community Declining interest, leadership disputes Medium Actionable Insights for Investors Considering LUNC For those considering Terra Classic as part of their cryptocurrency portfolio, several practical considerations emerge from our analysis. First, understand that LUNC represents a high-risk, high-potential-reward investment. The path to $0.0007 is fraught with challenges but not impossible. Key considerations for potential investors: Portfolio Allocation: Given the volatility, LUNC should represent only a small portion of a diversified cryptocurrency portfolio Time Horizon: The Terra Classic 2025 prediction suggests patience will be necessary for any substantial gains Monitoring Indicators: Track token burn rates, development activity, and exchange support as key metrics Risk Management: Establish clear entry and exit strategies based on your risk tolerance Conclusion: The Path Forward for Terra Classic Our comprehensive Terra Classic price prediction reveals a complex picture for LUNC’s future.

Frequently Asked Questions What is Terra Classic (LUNC)? Terra Classic is the original Terra blockchain that survived the collapse of its algorithmic stablecoin UST in 2022. The token was rebranded as LUNC (Luna Classic) after the ecosystem split into Terra 2.0 and Terra Classic chains. Who founded the Terra ecosystem? The Terra ecosystem was founded by Do Kwon and Daniel Shin through Terraform Labs. Do Kwon was particularly visible as the public face of the project before its collapse and subsequent legal challenges. What major exchanges support LUNC trading? Several major cryptocurrency exchanges continue to support LUNC trading, including Binance , KuCoin , and Gate.io . Exchange support has been crucial for maintaining liquidity and accessibility for Terra Classic. How does the token burn mechanism work? The Terra Classic community implemented a token burn mechanism that destroys a portion of LUNC tokens from transaction fees. This deflationary approach aims to reduce the total supply over time, potentially increasing scarcity and value. What is the relationship between Terra Classic and Terra 2.0? Following the ecosystem collapse, the community voted to create a new blockchain (Terra 2.0, with LUNA token) while maintaining the original chain as Terra Classic (LUNC). The two now operate as separate entities with different development paths and communities.

This strategy achieves relatively stable returns by capturing price differences between related assets, rather than relying on overall market trends. Such strategies perform exceptionally well in volatile market environments, but the potential challenges must be carefully assessed. Originally published on November 18, 2025 Take a Step Forward: Relative Value Trading Let's start taking more risks. Institutions aren't always just arbitrageurs or ""free riders""; they also try to profit from asset price fluctuations, but not in the way depicted in the movie ""The Big Short""—making a fortune by betting huge sums on a particular direction or event—even in the ""Wild West"" era of decades ago, most portfolio managers did not like that. ""Relative value trading"" is what they prefer. The core of relative value trading lies in identifying and exploiting price inconsistencies among related assets. Investors typically adopt a long-short pairing approach: going long on undervalued assets while shorting overvalued ones, anticipating that the spread will gradually converge to historical averages or theoretical equilibria, thereby generating profits. This strategy applies to various asset classes, including bonds, stocks, commodities, and derivatives. For instance, in fixed income markets, it can be executed through yield curve comparisons; in equity markets, it often takes the form of pairs trading among companies in similar industries. Unlike risk-free pure arbitrage, the convergence of spreads in relative value trading depends on market dynamics, thus involving uncertainty. Its key feature is market neutrality: the strategy does not bet on macroeconomic trends or price movements. Instead, it focuses on relative pricing inefficiencies, making it particularly suitable for operations driven by quantitative models, where institutions can leverage big data and algorithms to efficiently identify opportunities. This method can consistently generate alpha (excess returns) in efficient markets, rather than mere beta (market returns). To facilitate understanding, the following table illustrates a simple pairs trading example: This table demonstrates the basic logic of the strategy: capturing deviations by comparing historical data. Institutional investors favour relative value trading primarily due to its advantages in risk diversification and return optimisation. According to relevant studies, over 70% of institutional portfolios incorporate such strategies to address market uncertainties. Firstly, its market-neutral characteristic ensures relatively stable performance across bull and bear cycles. Regardless of the overall market trend, as long as asset correlations persist, the strategy can operate independently, which is crucial for institutions pursuing absolute returns. Secondly, this strategy facilitates the application of leverage and the integration of resources. By minimising directional exposure, institutions can amplify potential returns while controlling overall volatility. In subfields such as volatility trading, institutions can also act as liquidity providers, earning additional premiums and reallocating risk. Furthermore, relative value trading integrates easily into diversified frameworks, reducing tail risk impacts and providing smoother return curves. Institutions, with their advanced data tools and execution systems, hold significant advantages in this strategy, explaining its prevalence in professional circles. One More Step, More Risk Although relative value trading is designed to minimise risk, it still faces multiple potential challenges that may amplify losses under extreme market conditions. Key risks include basis risk: spreads may fail to converge or even widen, often due to macroeconomic events or asset-specific factors disrupting correlations. Historical cases, such as the 1998 Long-Term Capital Management (LTCM) collapse, where the Russian debt crisis shattered correlations and leverage effects led to rapid fund liquidation, highlight the severity of this risk. Execution risk also warrants attention: the strategy requires precise timing control, where market fluctuations or delays may cause slippage losses. Liquidity risk is particularly prominent during stress periods, with difficulties in asset realisation potentially leading to forced liquidations, especially when leverage is involved. Model risk stems from reliance on historical data; if deviations or cognitive biases (such as anchoring effects) exist, valuation accuracy will be compromised. Systemic risks may affect the entire strategy category, such as global geopolitical events. To manage these risks effectively, institutions built robust risk control systems that include real-time monitoring of correlation indicators, asset diversification, dynamic stop-loss thresholds, and regular stress testing. Leverage levels are adjusted based on market conditions to ensure strategy sustainability. Studies show that strict risk controls can keep the annualized volatility of such strategies within reasonable ranges. Retail Investor Perspective: Learning and Application Although relative value trading is more common among institutions, retail investors can also draw valuable lessons from it, such as the market-neutral philosophy: avoiding over-reliance on single-asset directional predictions and instead focusing on relative asset relationships. This helps diversify risks in volatile markets and fosters data-driven investment habits. Moreover, retail investors can enhance overall decision-making quality and avoid emotional trading by understanding correlation analysis. Secondly, emphasising risk management: retail investors should start with small capital, set stop losses, and avoid high leverage to prevent low-probability events from amplifying losses. Overall, this strategy teaches retail investors to focus on pricing inefficiencies rather than short-term speculation, promoting long-term investment thinking. Of course, retail investors can try simplified relative-value strategies, such as pairs trading: Selecting assets with high historical correlations, like stocks from similar industries (e.g., Pepsi vs. Coca-Cola), and going long on the undervalued and shorting the overvalued when spreads abnormally widen, expecting convergence. Another feasible approach is to use ETFs for relative-value operations, such as comparing deviations across sector ETFs. Studies indicate that such strategies at the retail level can achieve annualised returns of 5-10%, but must be combined with fundamental analysis to reduce risks. However, with limited resources, retail investors are advised to practise on simulation accounts first to avoid excessive exposure to real capital. So, What About Crypto Traders? In the crypto market, relative value trading is increasingly popular, especially amid the rise in institutional inflows in 2025, which is driving market maturity. Institutions commonly use strategies, including relative valuation: using indicators such as market cap-to-transaction volume ratios to assess cryptocurrencies relative to similar assets and going long on undervalued coins and shorting overvalued ones accordingly. Retail investors can learn simplified versions of these strategies: executing mainstream crypto pairs trading in the spot market and using data to monitor spreads. In 2025, with the proliferation of ETFs and DeFi tools, retail investors can achieve low-threshold operations. The key lies in risk control: using small positions and combining multiple charts. Institutional experience shows that such strategies can generate stable alpha, but retail investors should avoid excessive leverage to avoid some extreme scenarios. To sum up, relative value trading, as a core component of the financial toolkit, can create value for both institutions and retail investors in complex environments. However, its success depends on a profound understanding of market structures and continuous optimisation. Investors should view it as an auxiliary tool rather than a sole reliance, enhancing execution efficiency through data-driven methods. Under current market dynamics, this strategy will continue to play a role, but balancing returns and risks is essential to achieve long-term sustainable returns.

This landmark case reveals the dark underbelly of crypto money laundering and highlights the evolving tactics used to clean illicit funds through the blockchain. How Did This Massive Crypto Money Laundering Operation Work? According to reports from The Block, the criminal organization executed a two-phase scheme. First, they operated fraudulent online investment platforms designed to trick thousands of victims. After securing the funds, the second phase began: washing the digital trail clean. The group then moved the stolen cryptocurrency through a complex web of multiple exchanges and across various blockchains. This technique, known as “chain-hopping,” makes tracking the funds incredibly difficult for authorities. What Does This Mean for Crypto Regulation? This massive bust sends a clear message. International law enforcement is rapidly improving its ability to trace illicit crypto flows. However, the case also exposes critical vulnerabilities. Exchange Oversight: The use of multiple exchanges points to potential gaps in Know Your Customer (KYC) compliance. Cross-Chain Challenges: Moving funds between different blockchains remains a significant hurdle for investigators. Sophisticated Obfuscation: Criminals are using advanced methods to hide their tracks, staying ahead of basic monitoring tools. Can We Stop Future Crypto Money Laundering? While this bust is a major victory, the fight is far from over. The very features that make cryptocurrency innovative—speed, borderlessness, and pseudonymity—also attract bad actors. Therefore, a multi-pronged approach is essential. Enhanced cooperation between global law agencies like Europol and cryptocurrency exchanges is the first step. Furthermore, the development of more sophisticated blockchain analytics tools is crucial for following the money. Ultimately, user education is key to preventing the initial fraud that feeds these crypto money laundering schemes. The Bottom Line: A Watershed Moment Europol’s successful operation is a watershed moment. It proves that large-scale crypto money laundering rings can be identified and dismantled. This action strengthens the argument for balanced regulation that protects users without stifling innovation. For the average investor, it’s a reminder to practice extreme diligence and use only reputable, fully compliant platforms. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q: How do criminals launder money using cryptocurrency? A: They use techniques like “chain-hopping” (moving funds between different blockchains), using mixing services to obscure trails, and depositing funds into exchanges with weak identity checks. Q: Does this mean cryptocurrency is mainly used for crime? A> No. While high-profile cases draw attention, illicit activity represents a small fraction of total crypto transaction volume. The vast majority of use is legitimate. Q: What is Europol’s role in fighting crypto crime? A> Europol coordinates cross-border law enforcement efforts in the EU. It provides intelligence, technical expertise, and operational support to member states tackling complex crimes like crypto money laundering . Q: How can I protect myself from crypto fraud? A> Use established exchanges with strong KYC policies, enable all security features (2FA), be skeptical of “guaranteed high returns,” and never share your private keys or seed phrases. Q: Will this bust lead to stricter crypto regulations? A> It likely will. Major cases like this often accelerate regulatory discussions focused on anti-money laundering (AML) standards for crypto service providers globally.

According to a leading market analyst, the answer is a resounding yes. Tom Lee, Chairman of Bitmine, has made a bold declaration that Ethereum is extremely undervalued , positioning it not just as a digital asset but as the foundational bedrock for the future of global finance. His analysis points to a future where ETH’s price could undergo a monumental transformation. Why is Ethereum Considered Undervalued? Speaking at Binance Blockchain Week in Dubai, Tom Lee framed his bullish outlook around Ethereum’s unique and critical role. He described ETH as the “center of tokenization,” the essential infrastructure upon which the next wave of financial innovation will be built. His core argument is that the market has not yet priced in Ethereum’s fundamental utility as the primary settlement layer for a new digital economy. Lee projects that over $1 trillion in real-world assets —from real estate and bonds to complex financial instruments—will migrate onto blockchain networks. He positions Ethereum as the inevitable gateway for this historic transition. This isn’t just about speculation; it’s about ETH becoming the plumbing for a more efficient, transparent, and accessible global financial system. The Path to a $62,000 Ethereum Price How does an undervalued Ethereum reach such a staggering price target? Lee’s $62,000 projection hinges on a specific correlation with Bitcoin. He outlines a two-step scenario: First, Bitcoin must establish a new paradigm, breaking its traditional four-year cycle and reaching a price of $250,000 by early 2026. Second, the ETH/BTC trading pair must revert to its long-term average ratio of 0.25 (meaning 1 ETH would be worth 0.25 BTC). If these conditions align, the math points directly to a $62,500 valuation for ETH. This framework suggests that Ethereum’s explosive growth is intrinsically linked to, but will ultimately outperform, Bitcoin’s own bull market. Broader Market Context: Bottom In or More Pain? Lee’s optimism for Ethereum extends to the entire crypto market. He views the recent price declines not as a failure of fundamentals, but as a necessary deleveraging process . In his view, the worst is likely over, and the market has found its bottom. He draws a parallel to the recovery period after the FTX collapse, suggesting we could see a similar, powerful rebound in the coming months. This perspective offers a crucial insight: current volatility may represent a final shake-out before a sustained upward trend, making assets like an undervalued Ethereum a compelling opportunity for forward-looking investors. Actionable Insights from Tom Lee’s Analysis What should investors and enthusiasts take away from this bold forecast? Lee’s thesis provides a clear, long-term narrative shift for evaluating crypto assets: Look Beyond Price Cycles: The focus should shift from short-term trading patterns to fundamental utility and adoption. Understand Tokenization: The movement of trillions in assets onto blockchains is not a distant concept but an emerging reality, with Ethereum poised to be its main hub. Evaluate Correlation: Watch the ETH/BTC ratio as a key indicator of Ethereum’s relative strength and market perception. Tom Lee’s assertion that Ethereum is extremely undervalued is more than a price prediction. It is a conviction in a technological and financial revolution where ETH serves as the central ledger. While price targets are speculative, the underlying argument—that Ethereum’s role as the backbone for tokenization is grossly underestimated—provides a powerful framework for understanding its potential in the coming years. The journey from its current price to Lee’s visionary target would require unprecedented adoption, but for believers in a blockchain-powered future, the roadmap is now on the table. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: Who is Tom Lee and why should I trust his prediction? A1: Tom Lee is the Chairman of Bitmine (BMNR) and a well-known figure in cryptocurrency analysis. He is a former Wall Street strategist who has been involved in the crypto space for years, offering macroeconomic perspectives on digital assets. Q2: What does “Ethereum is extremely undervalued” actually mean? A2: It means Lee believes the current market price of ETH does not reflect its fundamental value and future utility, particularly its central role in the tokenization of real-world assets like real estate and stocks. Q3: Is the $62,000 ETH price target realistic? A3: It is a highly speculative, long-term target based on specific conditions: Bitcoin reaching $250,000 and the ETH/BTC ratio returning to 0.25. It represents a possible outcome if Ethereum becomes the dominant platform for global tokenization. Q4: What is tokenization and why is it important for Ethereum? A4: Tokenization is the process of converting rights to a real-world asset (like property or a bond) into a digital token on a blockchain. It’s important for Ethereum because its robust, programmable blockchain is the leading candidate to host these tokens, potentially generating massive demand for ETH. Q5: What is the ETH/BTC ratio? A5: It’s the price of Ethereum divided by the price of Bitcoin (ETH/BTC). A ratio of 0.25 means 1 Ethereum is worth 0.25 Bitcoin. Historically, this has been an average level, and a return to it would mean Ethereum gains value faster than Bitcoin. Q6: Does Tom Lee think the crypto bear market is over? A6: Yes, he suggested that crypto prices have likely bottomed out. He views recent declines as a market deleveraging event rather than a fundamental problem, anticipating a rebound similar to the post-FTX recovery period.

This marks the largest withdrawal period since its high-profile launch, signaling a potential cooling of institutional fervor. What’s driving this massive capital flight, and what does it reveal about the current state of Bitcoin adoption? Let’s dive into the data. What’s Behind the Record BlackRock IBIT Outflows? The trend is clear and concerning for proponents. According to CoinDesk, the BlackRock IBIT outflows have now stretched to a sixth consecutive week, with an additional $113 million leaving on December 4th. This sets a new record for the longest streak of net withdrawals since the fund debuted in early 2024. This sustained movement of capital out of the world’s largest asset manager’s Bitcoin product is impossible to ignore. Analysts point to a confluence of factors creating this perfect storm. Primarily, the outflows coincide with Bitcoin entering a bearish phase following a record liquidation event in October. The resulting price volatility and macroeconomic uncertainty have made fund managers cautious. Is Institutional Confidence in Bitcoin Waning? The scale of the BlackRock IBIT outflows suggests a strategic pullback, not just retail panic. Key reasons for this institutional hesitation include: Macroeconomic Headwinds: Rising interest rates and inflation fears are pushing investors toward traditional safe-haven assets. Profit-Taking: Some early institutional adopters may be locking in gains after Bitcoin’s strong performance earlier in the year. Risk Reassessment: The recent market correction has forced a broader reevaluation of crypto’s risk profile within diversified portfolios. Regulatory Uncertainty: While clearer in the US with ETF approval, the global regulatory landscape remains a patchwork, causing some pause. Decoding the Impact of Sustained ETF Outflows While $2.7 billion is a significant sum, context is crucial. The BlackRock IBIT outflows represent a portion of the fund’s total assets under management (AUM). However, the psychological impact and the precedent it sets are substantial. Prolonged outflows can: Increase selling pressure on Bitcoin’s spot price. Signal to other institutions that the short-term momentum has shifted. Test the resilience of the relatively new ETF infrastructure during its first major downturn. Therefore, this period serves as a critical stress test for the entire spot Bitcoin ETF ecosystem. The market is watching to see if these products can withstand volatility and maintain liquidity when sentiment turns. Actionable Insights for Crypto Investors For everyday investors, the BlackRock IBIT outflows offer valuable lessons. First, understand that institutional money is not a monolithic force; it reacts to market conditions and can exit as quickly as it enters. Second, use this data as a sentiment indicator, not a sole trading signal. The long-term thesis for Bitcoin often remains disconnected from short-term fund flows. Finally, consider dollar-cost averaging. Volatility and institutional maneuvering underscore the wisdom of a consistent, long-term investment strategy rather than trying to time the market based on weekly flow data. The Road Ahead for Bitcoin and Institutional Adoption Does this mean the institutional story is over? Far from it. The approval and existence of spot Bitcoin ETFs like IBIT have permanently changed the market structure. The current BlackRock IBIT outflows are a cyclical phenomenon within a secular trend. Institutional adoption is a marathon, not a sprint, and will be marked by periods of acceleration and consolidation. The key takeaway is that Bitcoin is now integrated into the traditional financial system. Its price and flows are subject to the same macroeconomic forces that affect stocks and bonds. This maturation, while sometimes painful, is a sign of the asset class growing up. Conclusion: A Reality Check, Not a Reversal The record BlackRock IBIT outflows provide a sobering reality check for the cryptocurrency market. They demonstrate that even the most bullish institutional narratives face headwinds. However, they do not invalidate the long-term potential of Bitcoin or the importance of regulated access points like ETFs. This phase highlights the market’s complexity and reminds investors that volatility works in both directions. The true test will be how the ecosystem responds and adapts in the coming months. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) What are BlackRock IBIT outflows? BlackRock IBIT outflows refer to the net amount of money investors are withdrawing from the iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT), BlackRock’s spot Bitcoin Exchange-Traded Fund. Net outflows mean more money is being pulled out than is being invested. Why are investors pulling money from the IBIT ETF? The primary reasons include Bitcoin’s recent bearish price trend, broader macroeconomic uncertainty (like interest rate concerns), and institutional investors rebalancing their portfolios or taking profits after earlier gains. Do these outflows mean the Bitcoin ETF experiment is failing? No. While significant, these outflows are a natural part of market cycles and represent a stress test for the new ETF structure. The very existence of these products signifies a major, lasting shift in how institutions can access Bitcoin. How do IBIT outflows affect the price of Bitcoin? Sustained large outflows can create additional selling pressure on Bitcoin’s spot price, as the ETF issuer may need to sell some of the Bitcoin it holds to return cash to exiting investors. However, many other factors also influence price. Should I sell my Bitcoin because of this news? Investment decisions should be based on your personal financial goals, risk tolerance, and long-term strategy, not solely on short-term fund flow data. Many investors use strategies like dollar-cost averaging to navigate volatility. Has BlackRock commented on these outflows? Asset managers like BlackRock typically do not comment on daily or weekly flow figures. They generally emphasize their long-term commitment to providing clients with access to digital asset technologies. Found this analysis of the BlackRock IBIT outflows insightful?

Retail accounts are often cluttered with highly correlated assets. For retail investors, many institutional trading strategies are inapplicable due to transaction fees and exchange restrictions. While trading ideas are certainly important—whether in arbitrage, relative value, or directional trading—the true determinant of profit and loss (P&L) is risk control. This is precisely the aspect most retail investors overlook. According to a long-term study by the French Financial Markets Authority (AMF), 89% of retail investors lose money trading Contracts for Difference (CFDs) and Foreign Exchange (Forex). These systemic losses stem not from a disparity in IQ or severe information asymmetry, but from a fundamental misalignment in risk management logic. Contrary to the narratives depicted in films and television, where traders skyrocket to success by placing heavy bets, the institutional logic is not to achieve theoretically infinite returns in one or a few trades, but rather ""survival first"": only those who survive the arrival of a ""black swan"" live to ""tell the tale"", rather than ""becoming history"". Why Do Retail Investors Always Suffer Losses? Regarding risk control, the core difference between retail and institutional investors lies in the definition of ""risk"". In the eyes of retail investors, risk is typically defined as ""I expected a rise, but the asset fell"" or ""I expected a fall and sold early, but the price rallied"". However, for institutional traders, risk is defined by the ""volatility"" and ""drawdown"" of the investment portfolio. Retail investors often fall into a linear P&L fallacy (directional traders are particularly prone to this trap). Prospect Theory in behavioural finance suggests that retail investors tend to be risk-seeking when facing losses—essentially ""holding on"" in the hope of breaking even. However, this behavioural pattern is mathematically devastating: once a loss exceeds 20%, a return of at least 25% is required to break even; if the loss reaches 90%, the remaining capital requires a 900% return to recover. The non-linear growth required to recoup losses forces retail investors to take on excessive risk, leading ultimately to bankruptcy. Furthermore, there is the issue of correlation. Retail accounts are often cluttered with highly correlated assets (e.g., holding NVDA, AMD, and TSM simultaneously, or a basket of altcoins). This is not ""diversification""; large quantities of highly correlated assets often move in lockstep. When the semiconductor sector declines, the entire portfolio faces significant losses. Similarly, the correlation amongst underlying assets in the altcoin market is typically maintained above 0.7, or even higher, meaning any single event can trigger a ""systemic sell-off"" across the board. Clearly, to ensure portfolio safety, retail investors must address two problems: How to execute stop-losses and achieve ""antifragility"" How to ensure the robustness of portfolio returns. How Do Institutions Manage Portfolios? In 1986, Gary P. Brinson and his colleagues reached a conclusion in their landmark paper ""Determinants of Portfolio Performance"" that is still regarded as the gold standard today: more than 90% of the variation in portfolio returns is attributed to asset allocation , rather than individual stock selection or market timing. Although subsequent research suggests that the fund manager's skill has a more substantial impact when illiquid strategies (such as private equity or real estate) are included, asset allocation remains the decisive factor governing portfolio returns. How do institutions utilise this? The answer lies in correlation. Global Macro Funds smooth their equity curves by constructing portfolios with low or even negative correlation. Long/Short Equity Funds utilise correlation to generate alpha beyond price movements. When banks manage their massive investment portfolios, asset correlation is often a primary parameter. Of course, correlation-based portfolio management is not without its challenges. In the current environment where leverage is ubiquitous, ""leverage"" itself has become a critical factor determining asset correlation. Deleveraging events often lead to a surge in correlation across different markets, while a return of risk appetite can drive a universal rise or fall in assets. Therefore, institutions not only continuously monitor correlations between assets but also focus on the correlation between different asset management strategies. Market-neutral strategies and Delta-neutral strategies typically maintain a low correlation with long-only strategies, serving as effective ""stabilisers"" within a portfolio. At the trading desk level, fund managers and traders adhere to a series of hard metrics. A widely applied metric is VaR (Value at Risk). It answers the question: ""In 99% of cases, what is the maximum amount I could lose tomorrow?"" If this figure exceeds the limit, algorithms force a liquidation, regardless of how bullish the trader may be. This prevents traders from ""holding on"" to losing positions and ensures the portfolio's losses are capped in worst-case scenarios. Additionally, Inverse Volatility Weighting is applied to portfolio management. Instead of an equal-weighted model, institutions allocate capital based on risk. Strict position limits are imposed on high-volatility assets (such as altcoins), whilst relatively looser limits are granted to assets with lower volatility. Do Institutions Speculate? ""Rollercoaster"" P&L curves are not welcomed by investors. Through the solutions mentioned above, institutions effectively control portfolio volatility and maximum drawdown. However, this does not mean institutions are perpetually ""risk-averse"". In certain scenarios, institutional risk appetite rises significantly, and they do engage in speculative trading. Generally speaking, however, institutions speculate with a portion of accumulated profits; they do not speculate with the principal capital. Institutional speculation follows the principle of ""Asymmetric Payoff"". Institutions only engage in speculative trading when the following conditions are met: The odds are sufficiently high: Institutions rarely participate in 1:1 wagers; the typical odds favoured by traders and fund managers are 1:3 or even 1:5. This implies that even with a win rate of only 30%, they remain profitable in the long run. There is a clear event driver: Institutions usually deploy a small amount of capital to speculate around major events. For example, Federal Reserve interest rate decisions, M&A restructuring, FDA drug approvals, and implied events in derivatives data (such as ""deleveraging"") are prime opportunities for trading. Conversely, when the market is relatively calm, institutions usually ""remain on the sidelines""; they do not incur unnecessary costs gambling on short-term technical analysis. There are appropriate tools: Institutions typically use options as insurance, but they also use them for speculation at specific times. The ""hard stop-loss"" attribute of options is the primary reason institutions favour them over Delta 1 leverage. In extreme cases, it is difficult to execute timely stop-losses with Delta 1 contracts, whereas options have the maximum loss locked into the model from the outset. Although various auxiliary tools based on Delta 1 (such as smart stop-loss and smart execution) are prevalent, they cannot solve liquidity issues, whereas options largely resolve this problem. The Evolution of the Retail Investor: How to Manage Your Money Like a Professional Fund？ For retail investors, many institutional trading strategies are inapplicable due to transaction fees and exchange restrictions. However, risk control strategies are largely universal; one does not need a Bloomberg Terminal to emulate institutional risk management thinking. ETFs significantly lower the barrier to portfolio allocation. ETF issuers have already pre-packaged assets; with just an IBKR or Robinhood account, retail investors can simultaneously purchase ETFs with significantly different risk levels, volatility profiles, and correlations, such as GLD, TLT, IBIT, IWM, SPY, and SVOL. With the proliferation of AI, investors can use AI to assist in formulating a robust ETF portfolio based on their risk appetite. Therefore, when investing, prioritise ETFs over underlying assets; trading a few ETFs is far more convenient than managing dozens of individual assets. Simple institutional risk control schemes can be incorporated into daily routines. For instance, the ""2% Rule"" (which states that the potential loss of any single trade must not exceed 2% of the total account equity) effectively controls potential portfolio losses. Furthermore, technical analysis indicators based on volatility, such as the Average True Range ((ATR)), can be integrated into the risk control system to set reasonably logical stop-loss boundaries. Do not forget stress testing. Although retail investors cannot easily build a stress testing system akin to a professional risk matrix, simple stress tests should still be considered. For example, calculate daily: ""If BTC rises/falls by 10%, how much will my account profit or lose? If I do not adjust my existing altcoin portfolio, what is my maximum drawdown if altcoins are cut in half?"" Such calculations and self-inquiry effectively help investors understand their account's risk exposure and prepare for potential fluctuations in their balance. There is an old saying on the streets: ""There are old traders, and there are bold traders, but there are no bold, old traders."" The essence of institutional risk control is acknowledging the unpredictability of the future. The advantage of institutions lies not in predicting the future but in building a deterministic survival capability within an uncertain market through strict risk control systems and mathematical rules, thereby ""surviving when wrong and profiting when right"". For retail investors, evolving from a ""prayer"" to a ""risk manager"" is a mandatory module in the course of investing. After all, before the miracle of compound interest can occur, you must first ensure you are still at the table.

Here’s Why,https://timestabloid.com/analyst-xrp-holders-will-get-extremely-rich-in-next-3-months-heres-why/,"XRP holders currently face a positive setup similar to the strongest periods in the asset’s history. A recent chart shared by Steph Is Crypto (@Steph_iscrypto) reveals past moments where XRP entered an altcoin year and produced a sharp price rally. He added a warning to investors, stating that this could get them extremely rich in the next 3 months. The chart suggests a possible return to conditions that supported major price acceleration in earlier cycles. The data shows a 100x surge during the first altcoin year and a 20x move during the second. The current structure now sits close to the start of another altcoin year . That position raises expectations for a fresh expansion phase. WARNING TO ALL $XRP HOLDERS. WE’RE GETTING EXTREMELY RICH IN THE NEXT 3 MONTHS! pic.twitter.com/vf4NG83IK4 — STEPH IS CRYPTO (@Steph_iscrypto) December 3, 2025 What Previous Altcoin Years Showed The chart maps XRP’s growth during two key periods. Each green box shows when the market reached an altcoin year. The first move occurred in 2017/18, when XRP reached its previous peak. The second came in 2021 when the asset rose to $1.96 despite market pressure and price suppression from the Ripple lawsuit . Both events aligned with shifts in market strength away from bitcoin dominance. XRP often rises significantly when Bitcoin dominance weakens , and the asset currently sits at a much higher base level of $2.17. That fact changes the scale of any future move. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 How High Can XRP Go? A move that mirrors the 20x increase from the second cycle would shift XRP toward $43.4. A move that mirrors the earlier 100x increase would place XRP near $217. A 10X move, which the chart suggests, would send the asset to $21.70. These figures rely on the same growth pattern noted during earlier altcoin years. The chart also shows XRP’s position inside the rising zone that historically came before each expansion phase. XRP reached this band before its earlier rallies. The market now sits inside the same range with higher lows and a stronger base level. Why Holders Expect Strong Gains XRP’s current position looks important for holders. The fresh move toward an altcoin year level suggests market rotation could support stronger demand. XRP now trades above levels that signaled the start of its earlier rallies. The asset has also shown notable strength in 2025 . XRP’s position near the altcoin year level gives traders a simple reference point. If the market repeats earlier cycles, XRP could deliver a major move within the next 3 months. Disclaimer : This content is meant to inform and should not be considered financial advice.

This fragmented reality within the European Union may soon end. The European Commission has unveiled a transformative proposal to shift crypto oversight from 27 national regulators to a single, powerful authority. This seismic change aims to dismantle barriers and forge a truly unified digital finance market. Let’s explore what this means for the future of crypto in Europe. Why is the EU Proposing a Single Crypto Oversight Regulator? The core driver is market fragmentation. Currently, cryptocurrency firms operating across the EU must navigate a complex patchwork of national rules. A company licensed in Germany faces different requirements in France or Italy. This inconsistency creates significant hurdles. It increases compliance costs, stifles innovation, and weakens the EU’s global competitiveness. The Commission argues that a single rulebook enforced by one supervisor is the solution. This move directly tackles the inefficiency of the current system. Who Will Become the New Crypto Watchdog? The proposal designates the European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA) as the central crypto oversight body. Based in Paris, ESMA already coordinates EU securities regulation. This shift would grant it direct supervisory powers over significant crypto-asset service providers (CASPs). Think of it as creating a European equivalent to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) for digital assets. ESMA’s new role would include: Direct Supervision: Overseeing the largest pan-European crypto firms. Rule Harmonization: Ensuring consistent application of the Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA) framework. Enforcement: Having the authority to investigate and penalize non-compliance. What Are the Potential Benefits of Unified Crypto Oversight? A centralized system promises several key advantages for both businesses and consumers. First, it creates a genuine single market. A crypto firm could obtain one license from ESMA to operate seamlessly across all 27 member states. This “passporting” benefit is a game-changer. It reduces legal complexity and costs, encouraging more investment and innovation within the EU. For users, it means stronger, uniform consumer protection and clearer rules, no matter where they are in the bloc. Ultimately, this could position the EU as a more attractive and stable hub for the crypto industry. What Challenges Lie Ahead for This Proposal? Despite its promise, the path to a single crypto oversight regulator is not without obstacles. The proposal must be approved by the European Parliament and the Council of the EU, a process that involves negotiation and could take time. Some member states may be reluctant to cede regulatory control to a supranational body. Furthermore, effectively supervising a fast-evolving, borderless industry like cryptocurrency will demand significant resources and expertise from ESMA. Balancing innovation with robust investor protection will be an ongoing tightrope walk. How Does This Compare to Global Crypto Regulation? The EU’s move stands in contrast to approaches elsewhere. The United States currently employs a multi-agency model, with the SEC and CFTC often overlapping. The UK is developing its own post-Brexit regulatory framework. By centralizing crypto oversight , the EU is betting on clarity and scale. If successful, the “Brussels effect” could see this model influence global standards, much like the GDPR did for data privacy. It represents a bold attempt to lead in shaping the digital finance landscape. In conclusion, the EU’s proposal to centralize crypto oversight under ESMA is a watershed moment. It seeks to replace confusion with clarity and fragmentation with unity. While challenges remain in its implementation, the vision is clear: a safer, more competitive, and innovative European crypto market. This decisive step could redefine the regulatory playbook for the world. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) What is the main goal of the EU’s new crypto oversight proposal? The primary goal is to end market fragmentation caused by differing national rules. It aims to create a single, harmonized regulatory environment to boost competitiveness, protect consumers, and foster innovation across the entire EU. Will ESMA regulate all crypto companies in the EU? Not all. The proposal suggests ESMA will directly supervise the largest, most significant cross-border crypto-asset service providers. Smaller, locally-focused firms may still fall under the supervision of national authorities, but all must follow the same MiCA rules. How will this affect cryptocurrency users and investors in Europe? Users should benefit from stronger, more consistent consumer protections regardless of their country. A clearer regulatory environment may also increase institutional participation, potentially leading to more product variety and market stability. When could this new single crypto oversight system take effect? There is no set date. The proposal must go through the EU’s ordinary legislative procedure, involving debate and amendment by the Parliament and Council. This process could take 18-24 months or longer before final adoption and implementation. Does this replace the existing MiCA regulation? No, it builds upon it. MiCA provides the rulebook. This proposal changes who enforces those rules for major players, shifting direct supervisory power from national agencies to ESMA for a more unified application. What has been the industry reaction to this proposal? Reactions are mixed but generally lean positive. Many industry groups welcome the clarity and efficiency of a single supervisor. However, some express concerns about the potential for over-regulation and the practical challenges of implementation. Found this analysis of the EU’s pivotal move on crypto regulation insightful?

MSTR's most recent BTC purchase brought its total to 650,000, currently valued at around $61 billion at an average price of $74,436 per BTC. The company faces an annual coupon bill on its universe of preferreds of around $807 million, ramping up the risk of a BTC winter. Strategy ( MSTR ) faces a dip in its yield and the specter of a crypto winter that could see the Bitcoin (""BTC"") treasury company face headwinds on the quarterly coupon payments of its expanding universe of preferreds. MSTR has four USD-denominated preferred shares, and recently issued its first EUR-denominated preferred shares in November. The company would end up selling 7.75 million of the EUR 10.00% Series A perpetual preferreds at 80 EUR per share for net proceeds of around EUR 608.8 million, or $702.2 million . MSTR has built and refined a strategy of issuing USD-denominated preferred shares with a blend of coupons from 8% to 10% to buy BTC. The shift to EUR came on the back of the company's prior statement to expand its capital raising efforts globally. MSTR also has an ongoing common stock at-the-market offering program, with its share count growing year-over-year by 60% during the fiscal 2025 third quarter to 315,393,000. Strategy Fiscal 2025 Third Quarter Form 10-Q Data by YCharts MSTR was most recently rated junk at "" B- "" by S&P Global Ratings, a single notch above ""CCC+"", with the rating agency highlighting the firm's low liquidity profile as a core driver of the junk rating. This was offset by no near-term debt maturities and a financing model that leans heavily on equity rather than credit. MSTR's developed a model called market-adjusted net asset value (""mNAV""), which captures the company's enterprise value in relation to the value of its BTC holdings. MSTR's most recent purchase was for $11.7 million worth of BTC, to bring its aggregate BTC holdings to 650,000. These were purchased for an average price per BTC of $74,436, and are currently valued at $61 billion, with BTC trading hands for $93,844 per BTC. This represents a healthy double-digit 20.68% average return for MSTR. The recent BTC low meant MSTR's current margin of safety before its holdings become a paper loss is volatile, ramping up the prospect of the preferreds MSTR is heavily dependent on seeing enhanced selling pressure. I last covered MSTR in May when BTC was looking to make a new 52-week high. STRK, The BTC Dip Spiral, And Liquidity Strategy Critically, the company spent $140 million in the third quarter on servicing its universe of preferreds. This universe has expanded with the issue of the EUR-denominated preferreds, but is set against a core software business that has become a footnote following MSTR's push to become a BTC treasury company. MSTR is in a position where it has to continue to issue new preferreds, take on debt, or sell more of its equity in the capital markets to maintain payments to the holders of its fixed-income securities. The company held total cash and short-term investments of just $56.20 million at the end of the third quarter, against what's set to be an annual coupon bill on its universe of preferreds of around $807 million . Data by YCharts However, MSTR just announced the establishment of a $1.44 billion USD reserve to manage heightened downside BTC volatility after the cryptocurrency fell 24% from its 52-week high. The most salient always-on risk for MSTR preferred holders centers on a BTC dip spiral. Holders of these are cognizant that MSTR cannot make payments from its legacy software business and that the strategy of buying and holding BTC faithfully without selling does not produce company-level cash flows to service the coupons. MSTR needs to maintain access to the capital market to issue new common and preferred shares to maintain payments to holders of the old preferred shares while buying more BTC. The company's mNAV has already dipped to 1.16, eliminating a figure that once stood above 2x, and providing MSTR with less leeway to tap its commons. Strategy QuantumOnline The 8.00% Series A Perpetual Strike Preferreds ( STRK ) pays out an $8 per share annual coupon, trading hands for $86.25 per share for a 9.30% current yield. These are not callable, forming a forever income security where MSTR would see the coupon payments accrue as a liability on its balance sheet in the event the coupon was suspended. STRK currently trades at a 14% discount to its $100 per share liquidation value, or for around 86 cents on the dollar. MSTR's mantra to never sell a single BTC will be tested in the event its mNAV dips below 1x, and as it faces $800 million in annual liabilities to its preferred holders. In this event, the company would find it harder to tap the capital markets and would likely need to sell BTC, helping spark a continued dip in the cryptocurrency that forces mNAV to continue to invert negatively. This would force MSTR to sell more BTC to meet coupon payments, as the company simply cannot lose access to the capital markets. Hence, the preferreds' coupons are seemingly safe against the USD and BTC reserves, albeit a prolonged BTC winter would likely see STRK's discount dramatically expand. Conclusion MSTR's move to establish a USD reserve that covers 21.4 months of the dividend is an acknowledgment of the threat the BTC dip spiral poses to its business of buying and holding BTC. Saylor once described volatility as a gift to the faithful. This is less of a gift when annual liabilities approach $1 billion from a business model that needs stable access to capital markets to meet these payments.

Once a steady force of demand, its monthly buys have fallen dramatically, changing the way market watchers view institutional support for Bitcoin. Sharp Drop In Monthly Purchases Based on reports, Strategy’s monthly accumulation peaked around 134,000 BTC in late 2024. By November 2025 that figure had dropped to roughly 9,100 BTC. That move amounts to about a 93% decline from the high-water mark. Buying this month was almost nil, with only 135 BTC recorded early in December. Those numbers show how quickly a major buyer can thin out. Strategy’s Bitcoin buying has collapsed through 2025. Monthly purchases fell from 134K BTC at the 2024 peak to just 9.1K BTC in November 2025, only 135 BTC so far this month. A 24-month buffer makes one thing clear: they’re bracing for the bear market. pic.twitter.com/qEwXR3JQ82 — CryptoQuant.com (@cryptoquant_com) December 3, 2025 A Big Buy Amid The Pullback Reports have disclosed that on November 17, 2025, Strategy made a sizeable purchase of roughly 8,178 BTC, a buy worth near $835 million at the time. The purchase was the largest for the firm since July and pushed its total holdings to about 649,870 BTC. But while that single entry was large, it did not reverse the broader trend: overall monthly activity is far lower than it was a year earlier. Big Holdings But More Cash On Hand? According to CryptoQuant, Strategy has also piled up cash — about $1.4 billion has been set aside. That reserve is being held to cover dividend payments, debt servicing and other company needs. Observers say this signals a shift toward preserving liquidity rather than steady accumulation of Bitcoin . In other words, the company appears to be prioritizing cash stability over more buys for now. What CryptoQuant And Others Are Watching Market analysts are taking the slowdown as a warning sign that corporate appetite for Bitcoin treasuries may be cooling. If other big holders act the same, the structural demand that helped support prices could weaken. Some traders will read the figures as a move to brace for a possible bear market. Others point out that Strategy’s enormous stash — nearly 650,000 BTC — still gives it room to ride out a downturn without having to sell immediately. Key signals to monitor include the monthly purchase totals going forward and any change in Strategy’s cash holdings. Observers will be watching to see if the company returns to regular Bitcoin purchases or if the reduced buying becomes the standard. It’s also important to monitor other corporate treasuries, because if several slowdowns occur together, the market for newly issued and available Bitcoin could tighten significantly.

Key Takeaways: HashKey plans to open orders next week for a Hong Kong IPO targeting at least $200 million. The exchange now operates across multiple global hubs and recently secured a $30 million investment at a valuation above $1 billion. HashKey has cleared its Hong Kong listing hearing and reported HK$1.3 trillion in spot-trading volume. The listing could take place before the end of the month, though final details, including deal size and timing, remain subject to change, Bloomberg reported , citing people familiar with the matter. HashKey’s Ethereum-Era Roots Propel It Into Global Crypto Expansion Founded in 2018, HashKey grew out of chairman Xiao Feng’s early involvement in Ethereum through Wanxiang Group, where he was among the protocol’s first corporate investors. The firm has since expanded into trading, venture investments and digital-asset management, operating across Hong Kong, Singapore, Bermuda, Japan, the UAE and Ireland. Earlier this year, Gaorong Ventures, known for backing Chinese tech groups such as Meituan and PDD, invested $30 million at a valuation exceeding $1 billion, sources said. Despite its regional footprint, HashKey has faced financial pressures. The company posted a HK$506 million ($65 million) loss in the first half of 2025, though the deficit narrowed from a year earlier. Revenue dropped 26% to HK$384 million, according to its listing documents. Even so, trading activity on the platform has been substantial, with HK$1.3 trillion in cumulative spot-market volume recorded by September.

Authorities rolled out a new licensing regime last year and are preparing additional measures to encourage broader participation after crypto activity lagged behind expectations. The city’s positioning has drawn interest from mainland Chinese investors, even though Beijing maintains a sweeping ban on crypto trading. Last week, HashKey cleared the Hong Kong Stock Exchange’s listing hearing, moving the operator of the city’s largest licensed crypto exchange closer to an initial public offering. The company disclosed the outcome in its Post Hearing Information Pack published on Monday, confirming that the listing committee of the Hong Kong Stock Exchange has completed its review of HashKey’s application. Crypto IPOs Gain Momentum Last month, tZero Group, a New York–based blockchain infrastructure firm focused on tokenized securities and real-world assets, announced that it is preparing to go public in 2026 . Before that, BitGo officially filed for an initial public offering , becoming the first dedicated crypto custodian to pursue a listing on a US stock exchange. BitGo’s IPO filing came amid renewed momentum for crypto-related public offerings. The digital asset space has seen several notable public listings in 2025. Stablecoin issuer Circle made a splash with its IPO in June, surging more than sevenfold since going public. Online trading platform Etoro , which offers crypto trading among its services, debuted in May. In addition, Galaxy Digital, led by Mike Novogratz, moved its listing from the Toronto Stock Exchange to Nasdaq earlier this year. Gemini, the exchange founded by the Winklevoss twins, filed confidentially for a U.S. IPO in June, signaling strong market confidence in crypto exchanges going public.

However, within hours of activation, a critical bug in the Prysm consensus client threatened network stability, causing validation issues that slowed block finalization before client diversity safeguards prevented a potential crisis. The incident unfolded as Prysm nodes experienced denial-of-service-like conditions triggered by excessive historical state generation. Prysm core developer Terence Tsao explained that “ historical state generation is compute and memory heavy, and a node can be dos’ed by a large number heavy, and a node can be dos’ed by a large number of state replays happening in parallel. ” To shine more light on this, historical state generation is compute and memory heavy, and a node can be dos'ed by a large number of state replays happening in parallel. over the past two hours we’ve seen a spike in stale attestations targeting checkpoint roots from off slots… https://t.co/lnNtD05Tuc — terence (@terencechain) December 4, 2025 Over two hours, a spike in stale attestations targeting checkpoint roots from off-slots forced affected nodes to reconstruct historical states, pushing systems into compromised operating conditions. The Ethereum Foundation quickly issued emergency guidance, while ten other consensus clients maintained network operations, preventing any service disruption. Client Diversity Proves Its Value During Crisis While Prysm operators scrambled to implement the emergency workaround flag –disable-last-epoch-targets , alternative clients, including Lighthouse, Teku, Nimbus, and Lodestar, continued validating blocks without interruption. The network maintained consensus throughout the incident, with finalization continuing despite affected validators experiencing participation issues. Lido Finance reported minimal impact compared to other staking solutions, attributing its resilience to distributed validator operations where Prysm powers approximately 15% of node operators.

The Lido protocol continues to operate normally and there is no cause for concern for stakers. Lido was less affected by this incident than other… — Lido (@LidoFinance) December 4, 2025 The protocol’s Q3 2025 metrics demonstrate balanced client usage as a deliberate strategy to mitigate single-client failure risks. Most Lido-operated Prysm setups recovered within hours after applying the recommended configuration changes or temporarily switching to alternative clients. The incident reinforced long-standing arguments for client diversity as Ethereum’s primary defense against consensus failures. Developer Kydo captured the significance, noting that the upgrade simultaneously reinforced four critical narratives: Zero-downtime operations Layer-2 scaling capability through PeerDAS activation Client diversity protection Revenue-generating potential. Ethereum briefly hit $3.2 billion annual run rate during the incident as blob fee mechanisms adjusted to new pricing parameters. PeerDAS and Blob Scaling Transform Data Availability Beyond the Prysm incident, Fusaka delivered transformative upgrades to Ethereum’s data layer through the PeerDAS implementation and the Blob Parameter Only (BPO) fork mechanism. PeerDAS introduced data availability sampling, enabling nodes to store only 1/8 of the blob data while maintaining security guarantees. This architectural shift enables throughput increases up to 8x current capacity while keeping hardware requirements manageable for independent operators. Vitalik Buterin emphasized the upgrade’s historical significance, stating, “ PeerDAS in Fusaka is significant because it literally is sharding. “ He celebrated the achievement as a dream dating back to 2015, noting “ Ethereum is coming to consensus on blocks without requiring any single node to see more than a tiny fraction of the data. “ PeerDAS in Fusaka is significant because it literally is sharding.

The BPO mechanism enables Ethereum to increase blob capacity between major upgrades rather than waiting for coordinated hard forks. Fusaka maintains the current 6-blob target initially, but scheduled adjustments will raise limits to 10/15 on December 9, 2025, and 14/21 on January 7, 2026. This addresses mounting pressure as layer-2 demand pushed Ethereum’s blob capacity toward saturation throughout 2024. EIP-7918 ties blob base fees to execution costs, preventing market collapse. Blob fees jumped 1,500x immediately after activation, rising from 1 wei to 1,500 wei. Source: X/@jarrodwatts Developer Kydo explained this increase “ restores a functioning fee market for blobs, so the protocol can actually use price to steer blob demand instead of being stuck at 1 wei. “ The change ensures that layer-2 operators pay meaningful costs for the computational resources their operations impose on network nodes. Notably, Matt Hougan, CIO at Bitwise, also praised the momentum, noting, “ Ethereum delivering two major upgrades in one year is impressive. The giant is awake and doing the right things. “ Ethereum delivering two major upgrades in one year is impressive.

Only 8% of current investors began investing within the past two years, a steep drop from 21% who started during the two years preceding the 2021 study. The shift suggests the tide of pandemic-era market participation has entirely ebbed, with younger adults particularly affected by the reversal. Young investors under 35 saw their participation rate fall from 32% in 2021 to 26% in 2024, erasing gains made during the market surge. Source: FINRA Similarly, investment rates declined among people of color and men, reversing increases observed just three years earlier. The median age of investors who entered the market around 2019-2021 rose from 31 to 38, indicating many younger participants left the market entirely. Beyond slower entry rates, investors pulled back from various high-risk positions. Cryptocurrency is now viewed as extremely or very risky by 66% of those aware of digital assets, up from 58% in 2021. The percentage holding penny stocks, REITs, private placements, and structured notes all declined to 2018 levels after brief increases. Risk Appetite Shrinks Across Demographics Investors’ willingness to embrace substantial portfolio risk dropped to just 8% in 2024 from 12% in 2021, with the decline most pronounced among younger market participants. Among investors under 35, those willing to take substantial risks fell from 24% to 15%, creating a notable contradiction; 62% of this age group still believe they need big risks to reach financial goals. “ The latest FINRA Foundation research on investors provides rich insights into how market conditions, technology and generational shifts are changing the profile of investing and reshaping investor behaviors and attitudes, ” said Jonathan Sokobin, FINRA Foundation Chair and Chief Economist. Despite reduced risk appetite, younger investors continue to engage in behaviors that carry greater potential losses. 43% of those under 35 trade options, compared to 10% of investors 55 and older, while 22% make margin purchases, versus just 4% of older participants. Meanwhile, 13% of all investors report buying meme stocks or viral investments, including 29% of those under 35. The crypto decline appears most dramatic among new investors. Those with less than 2 years’ experience who are considering digital assets dropped from 61% in 2021 to 48% in 2024, while consideration among experienced investors fell less sharply. Among investors under 35 specifically, cryptocurrency consideration plummeted from 62% to 49%, compared to smaller declines in older age groups. Social Media Influence Grows Despite Market Caution The study found social media “ Finfluencers ” now guide investment decisions for 26% of investors, rising to 61% among those under 35. YouTube remains the dominant platform for investment information, with 30% overall usage, rising to 61% among younger investors. Word of mouth from friends and family emerged as the top information source for 85% of investors under 35, surpassing recommendations from financial professionals at 67%. Concern over investment fraud has risen somewhat, with 37% of investors worried about losing money to scams, up from 31% in 2021. However, the vast majority, 89%, do not believe they have been targeted in investment fraud. When presented with a fraudulent offer promising “ guaranteed, risk-free 25% annual returns, ” half of investors said they would invest, revealing significant gaps in fraud awareness. FINRA Foundation President Gerri Walsh emphasized the continuing importance of investor education. “ They still struggle with gaps in investing knowledge and risk assessment, which can leave them vulnerable to costly missteps, ” Walsh said. “ Investor education efforts remain critically important. “ Notably, the findings oppose broader market trends showing that crypto adoption continues to grow, with separate surveys indicating that over 50 million American adults now own digital assets . Another also links declining homeownership affordability to increased crypto speculation among younger generations seeking alternative wealth-building strategies.

55390400,https://blog.bitfinex.com/?p=27343,1764936181,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/99/default.png,How to Earn with Margin Lending on Bitfinex,https://blog.bitfinex.com/education/how-to-earn-with-margin-lending-on-bitfinex/,"If you’re holding either fiat or cryptocurrency on Bitfinex but not actively trading, Margin Lending is a smart way to put your capital to work. You can earn by participating in our peer-to-peer funding marketplace. In simple terms: you lend to other traders who need leverage for their positions. You earn while keeping ownership of your crypto. Historically, margin lending has offered generally higher returns than conventional savings accounts, making it an alternative for long-term holders who wish to generate earnings with their otherwise idle assets. What Is Margin Lending? Margin lending (also called Margin Funding on Bitfinex) is a peer-to-peer (P2P) marketplace where you can lend your assets to traders who want to trade with leverage. Here’s how it works in simple terms: You (the lender) have funds (can be cryptocurrency or fiat) sitting in your account. Instead of letting it sit idle, you offer it to traders at an interest rate you choose. Traders (the borrowers) need extra capital to amplify their trading positions, whether going long (betting prices will rise) or short (betting prices will fall). They put up collateral, borrow your funds temporarily and pay you interest. The platform (Bitfinex) matches your lending offers with traders’ borrowing offers, manages the collateral, and handles the interest payments automatically. Why Consider Margin Lending? 1. Earn Daily: You earn daily without requiring active trading or technical analysis. Earnings are credited every day around 01:30 AM UTC, providing a consistent payment stream. 2. Potential Higher Returns Than Traditional Savings: During periods of high trading activity or volatility, rates can spike significantly as demand for leverage increases. 3. You Stay in Control: You decide: How much to lend (minimum $150) The interest rate you’re willing to accept The duration of the loan (from 2 to 120 days) 4. Platform Safeguards: Bitfinex has implemented multiple protective measures: Collateral Requirements : Traders must provide collateral from their margin wallet before borrowing Automatic Liquidation : If a trader’s position moves against them and their collateral drops below the maintenance margin, their position is liquidated automatically Priority Protection : In a liquidation event, your lending is paid back before traders can access their funds 5. Flexibility: Once you lend your funds for a chosen period, you can’t cancel the loan early. However, the trader who borrows your funds can return them at any time before the period ends, and your interest is calculated based on how long the funds were actually used. If the funds are returned in less than an hour, you will still receive a full hour of interest. This means your funds may come back sooner than expected, but you’re always paid for the time they were lent out. 6. Diverse Currency Options: Bitfinex supports margin funding in multiple currencies, not just Bitcoin or Ethereum, but also stablecoins like USDT (this is actually the most popular currency for lending in Bitfinex’s peer-to-peer lending marketplace) and many others, giving you options based on your risk tolerance and portfolio composition. 7. A Steady Option: Depending on your risk appetite and personality, lending can feel steadier than trading. Rather than guessing market direction, you simply allow traders to borrow your funds and earn from the activity. In unpredictable markets, it’s a calmer way to keep your capital working without the constant pressure of making trading decisions. Real-World Scenarios * * The rates, periods, amounts and returns set out above are hypothetical and provided for illustrative purposes only. Actual earnings, interest rates or other results may differ. Bitfinex makes no guarantees regarding the amount of earnings, interest rates or other results. The peer to peer lending market on the Site is available only pursuant to the Terms of Service . How Does Margin Lending Work on Bitfinex? Prerequisites: Margin Trading, Margin Funding and Bitfinex Borrow require at least Intermediate level verification for all Bitfinex accounts created after March 1, 2022. Make sure your account verification is complete. Step 1: Transfer to Funding Wallet Move the currency you want to lend from your Exchange or Margin wallet on Bitfinex to your Funding Wallet . This is a simple internal transfer with no fees. Popular choices include: USDT/USD : Generally highest demand and most stable rates BTC : For Bitcoin holders wanting to earn in BTC ETH : Second most popular crypto for lending Step 2: Go to Funding On the top navigation bar, click Funding Select Funding (not Bitfinex Borrow) Choose the currency you want (USDT, USD, BTC, ETH, etc.) Step 3: Review the market Before creating your offer, check the current market: Green (bids): What traders/ borrowers are willing to pay Red (offers): What other lenders/ sellers are offering Look at the rates, amounts, and periods being requested Navigate to the Funding Form and set your terms: Amount: Minimum $150 worth Rate: Choose between: Fixed rate : You set a specific daily rate manually by entering the daily rate you want to receive and not checking any other boxes (Hidden, FRR, FRR Variables, FRR Fixed) FRR (Flash Return Rate): This rate follows the market rate in the Bitfinex lending marketplace. If you select this option, your lending offers will be at the then current FRR when the loan is taken, but it stays fixed at that rate for the whole loan. (The FRR is based on the weighted average of the most recent funding trades, smoothed to avoid sudden spikes. This rate updates once per hour.) FRR Variable : If you select this option, your rate will automatically move up and down along with the FRR and not be fixed during the term of your loan. FRR + Delta : This allows you to make loans based on the FRR, but with a bonus for you or a reduction to make your loans more competitive. FRR with a custom offset (for example, FRR + 0.001). If you select this option, your lending offers will be at the then current FRR when the loan is taken adjusted by the offset you selected, and stays fixed at that rate for the whole loan. Period: 2-120 days (most common: 2, 7, or 30 days) Pro tip : Check what rates are getting filled. Setting your rate slightly more competitive than others increases the chance of quick matching. Bonus : Use the chart to see historical funding rates, matched funding volume, and FRR APR: See the main chart for historical funding rates . You could also add indicators like Moving Averages (MA) or Relative Strength Index (RSI) to better filter volatility and average highs. See top left for volume and FRR APR *. *FRR APR = FRR daily x 365 Step 4: Order Matching & Earnings Your offer goes into the funding order book. When a borrower’s bid matches your offer terms, the funding is provided automatically. Once matched, you’ll be able to see the amount you are offering, the rate at which interest will be calculated, and when the funds are scheduled to return to you. Interest accumulates daily and is credited around 01:30 AM UTC. Step 5: Monitor & Collect Under “Provided”, track your active loans, interest earned, and time remaining. When the loan period expires or the trader closes their position early, your principal plus accumulated interest returns to your Funding Wallet, ready to be lent again or withdrawn. Understanding the Numbers Interest rates on Bitfinex are quoted as daily rates , but it may be easier to think in annual terms. Example : You lend $10,000 USDT at a daily rate of 0.06% Daily earnings: $10,000 × 0.06% = $6.00 per day Annualized rate: 0.06% × 365 = 21.9% per year As a funding provider, you receive the interest paid by the trader borrowing your funds. Bitfinex deducts a 15% fee from your earned interest (or 18% for hidden orders). So your actual daily earnings would be: $6.00 × 0.85 (after 15% fee) = $5.10 per day Approximately $1,861.50 per year on a $10,000 loan Understanding the Risks and Why “Whales” Choose Bitfinex While margin lending on Bitfinex has protective mechanisms, it’s important to understand the potential risks: 1. Extreme Market Volatility In theory, if the price changes dramatically losses could be incurred by margin funding providers. Think of extreme scenarios like flash crashes or “black swan” events where liquidation mechanisms can’t execute fast enough. There’s a reason Bitfinex has been the platform of choice for institutional traders and “whales” since 2012. Margin lenders have never suffered losses from lending in the 13 years that Bitfinex has been in operation, even during events such as the 2020 COVID crash, the 2021 Evergrande crisis, and the 2022 Luna collapse. Our multi-layered liquidation engine is designed to protect lenders first and has a track record of doing just that. 2. Platform Risk While Bitfinex’s security infrastructure, regular proof-of-reserves, and conservative risk management have earned the trust of the world’s largest crypto traders, like any exchange-based activity, there’s inherent platform risk to margin lending. Your funds remain on an exchange while lent out, so standard exchange security considerations apply. 3. Opportunity Cost If you lend your cryptocurrency at a fixed rate and market rates spike dramatically, you’re locked into your original rate until the loan period expires or is repaid. This is simply the nature of fixed term lending. That said, Bitfinex’s funding market offers both fixed and flexible rate options, which can adjust more quickly to changing market conditions. It also allows for shorter loan periods (2-7 days) so you can stay nimble. Once a short-term loan expires, you can update your fixed rate to match the latest market conditions. This is why many lenders tend to prefer shorter durations: they get to refresh their offers more often and stay aligned with where the market is heading. Bitfinex is among the few major exchanges that offer a true peer to peer funding market driven entirely by supply and demand. You choose your rate, your amount, and your loan duration, with terms as short as two days. Some other exchanges offer yield products where the platform dictates the terms and rates and customers have much less control. 4. Market-Driven Returns There is no deposit insurance and funding returns are determined by market demand for leverage. In slower markets, offers may not be matched immediately. Bitfinex hosts an active margin trading community, which often leads to consistent borrowing activity however, there are no guarantees. Borrower demand usually rises when volatility picks up, and funding rates can reflect that shift more dynamically compared with traditional yield products. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) 1. Can I change or close my funding offer early? Once your funding is matched and active, it cannot be recalled early by you. You must wait until the loan expires or until the borrower returns the funds. If your offer is still pending in the order book, you may cancel or modify it at any time. 2. How does Bitfinex match lending orders? Margin Funding is a marketplace which matches borrowers and lenders on a rate-priority + duration-compatibility basis: Lower-rate offers tend to be matched first Your maximum duration must be equal to or longer than the borrower’s requested duration FRR (Flash Return Rate) offers adjust automatically, but are not guaranteed to match immediately; they are filled only when the market borrowing rate meets or exceeds the FRR level Manual fixed-rate offers only fill when borrowers accept the specified rate Partial fills may occur, and lenders provide liquidity to a number of different borrowers rather than to a single borrower. 3. How can I improve my lending returns? Returns depend on market demand. Common strategies include: Using shorter durations (2–7 days) to capture rate movements Mixing manual fixed-rate offers (select current matched rates) with FRR for flexibility Taking advantage of high-volatility periods Using automated tools or bots that help adjust rates and durations dynamically Shorter-term offers often capture market spikes more effectively. 4. Are there any fees for providing funding? Lenders do not pay fees to offer funding. Borrowers pay interest, and Bitfinex takes a percentage of the funding earnings as the platform fee. See our fees page for more details: https://www.bitfinex.com/fees/. 5. What happens when my loan expires? At expiration, funds return to your Funding Wallet. If Auto-Renew is enabled, Bitfinex automatically routes a new lending offer on your behalf based on the settings you selected (i.e., the same settings are your previous loan). Fixed-rate loans cannot be adjusted mid-term, even if market rates rise. 6. Can I use third-party lending bots? Bitfinex supports third-party integrations through API keys, and many advanced customers choose lending bots to automate rate adjustments and improve capital efficiency. However, please keep in mind: Bitfinex does not endorse, certify, or guarantee any third-party tools Customers are fully responsible for granting and managing their own API permissions We strongly recommend using API keys with limited permissions and reviewing the bot provider’s security practices If switching bots, you may generate a new API key at any time Many experienced lenders find these tools helpful in automating their strategies, but proper caution and risk management are important when using any external service. Ready to start earning? Margin lending on Bitfinex presents an opportunity for cryptocurrency holders to put their idle assets to work. Whether you’re earning daily interest on stablecoins or accumulating more cryptocurrencies through lending, margin lending provides a flexible tool to increase the potential of your crypto holdings.

XRP Will Be Bigger Than Bitcoin. Here’s why,https://timestabloid.com/market-strategist-its-obvious-xrp-will-be-bigger-than-bitcoin-heres-why/,"The debate over Bitcoin’s long-term dominance has intensified as blockchain adoption matures. Investors are no longer focused only on store-of-value assets. They are now examining real utility, speed, and institutional integration. That shift has created space for a serious comparison between Bitcoin and XRP, especially as global finance demands faster and cheaper settlement rails. In a recent video posted on X, Levi Rietveld of Crypto Crusaders reignited the debate. He argued that XRP holds structural advantages that position it for outsized growth . Levi stated that “XRP is going to be bigger than Bitcoin, and it is so freaking obvious.” His comments have sparked fresh interest in how the two assets compare in terms of utility and financial integration. Technology and Transaction Speed XRP uses a unique consensus mechanism that settles transactions in about four seconds. This speed positions it as a practical tool for cross-border payments and real-time financial operations. IT'S OBVIOUS! $XRP WILL BE BIGGER THAN BITCOIN! Comment “knowledge” and I’ll DM you access to my community! Like & repost to spread awareness!! pic.twitter.com/ZkiKYQt3L8 — Levi | Crypto Crusaders (@LeviRietveld) December 4, 2025 Bitcoin, by contrast, relies on proof-of-work mining, which produces slower confirmation times. Because of this slower design, Bitcoin is less suitable for high‑volume payment activity, even though it reinforces its store‑of‑value narrative. Cost Efficiency and Scalability Transaction costs on the XRP Ledger remain extremely low. The network was built for efficiency at scale, allowing thousands of transactions with minimal fees. Bitcoin’s fees can increase sharply during periods of network congestion. This makes small or frequent payments less practical for users who require predictable and inexpensive settlement. Integration With Financial Systems Ripple’s work with banks and payment firms continues to set XRP apart. The company has established corridors that enable faster regional and international transfers. These corridors demonstrate the real-world use of XRP as a liquidity bridge asset. Levi emphasized this distinction, noting that XRP is “more integrated into the financial systems,” which he believes strengthens its long-term relevance. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Real-World Utility Versus Digital Gold Bitcoin remains unmatched as decentralized digital gold. Its appeal lies in scarcity, security, and store-of-value strength. XRP takes a different approach. It functions as a utility token designed to move value efficiently across global systems. These contrasting roles make the comparison complex, yet Levi insists XRP “is simply just a better product in every single category.” His view focuses on utility over narrative and on adoption over ideology. The Road Ahead Predicting which asset will become “bigger” depends on how one defines the term. Bitcoin leads in market capitalization and global recognition, and that advantage remains significant. XRP’s path relies on increasing real-world adoption, deeper financial integration, and broader regulatory clarity. If global banks continue seeking faster settlement solutions, XRP’s role could expand dramatically. Levi’s bold claim challenges long-standing assumptions in crypto. His message is clear: investors must evaluate assets through measurable performance and real utility. Whether XRP eventually surpasses Bitcoin remains uncertain, but the comparison is no longer driven by hype. It now reflects a changing financial landscape where speed, efficiency, and integration matter more than ever.

This zone may now act as a key support level as traders assess whether the market has formed a new base. Heavy Accumulation Around $84,400 Data from Glassnode, shared by analyst Ali Martinez, shows that 300,648 BTC were acquired between $84,375 and $84,635 as of December 3, 2025. This level saw the highest concentration of accumulation during the recent pullback, making it a clear area of interest for long-term holders. 300,648 Bitcoin $BTC were accumulated around $84,400, making it a significant support level. pic.twitter.com/i9FAqEpHMI — Ali (@ali_charts) December 5, 2025 Earlier this week, Bitcoin dipped below $84,000 following a sharp decline but quickly recovered. As of press time, BTC trades at around $91,300, showing a 2% decline over the past 24 hours, but a slight increase over the past week. Meanwhile, the Long-Term Holder SOPR (30-day average) is currently at 1.40, based on on-chain data. SOPR above 1 means long-term holders are selling their coins at a profit. SOPR tends to fall below 1 during accumulation phases and near 0.50 at deeper cycle lows. Ali stated , “Dollar-cost averaging makes sense when SOPR drops below 1.” With SOPR at elevated levels, the data suggests the market is in a profit-taking phase, not one of heavy accumulation. Trendline Rejection and $80K Support in Focus Bitcoin saw its deepest pullback of the year, falling over 36% after being rejected by a long-term trendline, according to analyst Rekt Capital. Previous rejections from the same trendline caused corrections of 32% and 14%, showing the strength of this resistance level. Price support around $80,000 has held several times. Past rebounds from this area have reached 31% and 48%, though the current recovery stands at only 15%. Rekt Capital noted that if this bounce remains limited, it may suggest a weakening of the $80K support area. Double Barrier Ahead: Trendline and FVG Chart analysis from Titan of Crypto shows Bitcoin facing a “ double barrier ” consisting of the 3-year ascending trendline and a weekly bearish Fair Value Gap (FVG). The price is currently below both levels. This zone now acts as resistance. Bulls need to push through the trendline and close the FVG to reclaim momentum. “This is where bulls need to show strength,” Titan said. CryptoPotato reported that recent price movements and market signals could indicate Bitcoin is nearing the bottom range of its current cycle. Traders are monitoring the $93,500 resistance level, which has been tested repeatedly in recent sessions, making it a key area to watch for a potential breakout or reversal.

XRP experienced a rapid rise in a short period, reaching a peak of $3.6 in July. However, it subsequently experienced a rapid decline, falling below $2 in the latest decline. As the atmosphere of uncertainty surrounding XRP continues, crypto analysis platform Santiment noted that market sentiment towards XRP is rapidly declining. Santiment noted that, according to data, XRP has fallen more than 31 percent in the last two months and entered fear territory again earlier this month. According to Santiment, this could be an opportunity for XRP, citing historical data that shows a 22% increase in three days following the same level of fear, adding that an opportunity may be emerging now. “XRP price is down -31% in the last 2 months. Also, unlike Bitcoin, XRP is seeing the most fear, uncertainty, and doubt (FUD) since October according to our social data. The last time we saw this level of fear in the crowd was on November 21st, and the price of XRP immediately rose by 22% over the next three days. Then greed took over and the rally quickly ended. Now, just like two weeks ago, an opportunity appears to be emerging.” XRP continues to trade at $2 at the time of writing. *This is not investment advice.

This AI-powered education company isn’t just teaching about the future—it’s investing in it. With this latest acquisition, their total Bitcoin holdings now stand at a formidable 180 BTC. But what’s the real story behind this strategic purchase? Why Is Genius Group Doubling Down on Bitcoin? Genius Group made this purchase at an average price of $89,700 per Bitcoin. This decision follows a period of active portfolio management where the company sold 62 BTC back on October 11. Their recent trading activity has already generated an impressive $1 million in profit. This isn’t random speculation; it’s a calculated corporate treasury strategy. The company’s approach demonstrates sophisticated balance sheet management. Rather than simply holding Bitcoin passively, Genius Group actively trades portions of its holdings to capitalize on market movements. This hybrid strategy—combining long-term holding with strategic trading—reflects a mature understanding of cryptocurrency as both a store of value and a trading asset. How Does Bitcoin Fit Into Genius Group’s Business Model? As an AI-based education company, Genius Group operates at the intersection of technology and learning. Their Bitcoin investments align perfectly with this forward-thinking identity. Consider these key aspects of their strategy: Diversification: Bitcoin provides a non-correlated asset that diversifies their corporate treasury beyond traditional holdings Inflation Hedge: In an era of monetary expansion, Bitcoin serves as protection against currency devaluation Strategic Alignment: Holding cryptocurrency reinforces their position as a tech-forward education provider Profit Generation: Their successful trading demonstrates Bitcoin’s potential for active portfolio management This isn’t just about accumulating Bitcoin—it’s about integrating cryptocurrency into their core financial operations. The $1 million profit from recent trading shows they’re executing this strategy effectively. What Can Other Companies Learn From This Approach? Genius Group’s Bitcoin strategy offers valuable lessons for other corporations considering cryptocurrency investments. First, they maintain transparency about their holdings and transactions. Second, they balance long-term holding with opportunistic trading. Third, they align their investments with their technological brand identity. The company’s current 180 Bitcoin holdings represent significant exposure to the cryptocurrency market. However, their active management approach suggests they’re not simply “HODLing” blindly. They’re making strategic decisions based on market conditions, as evidenced by their October sale followed by this recent purchase.

The launch marks an important step for Base as it aims to build an interconnected onchain economy. The bridge went live on mainnet this week and now supports early integrations in several popular applications. Besides improving liquidity, the move strengthens Base’s goal to create a network where assets and activity move freely without technical barriers. Bridge Goes Live With Chainlink Support According to the blog post , the bridge relies on Chainlink’s Cross-Chain Interoperability Protocol and independent verification from Coinbase. Both systems validate every message to ensure secure transfers. Developers can now support Solana assets inside Base applications while maintaining direct settlement. Moreover, users can move tokens such as SOL, CHILLHOUSE, and TRENCHER into Base and use them in apps like Zora, Virtuals, Aerodrome, Flaunch, and Relay. The team released open-source documentation to encourage builders to integrate the bridge. Consequently, projects on Base can enable native support for Solana’s SPL tokens without creating workarounds. Anyone can also export Base assets to Solana, allowing liquidity to circulate more efficiently across both ecosystems. Expanded Opportunities for Developers and Users Base has stated its long-term vision to serve as a hub for a global digital economy. The team wants activity across chains to feel unified and accessible. The new bridge represents a major step toward that goal. Additionally, the rollout broadens opportunities for traders who want direct access to both networks without depending on centralized routes. Solana’s market performance shows mixed movement during the launch window. SOL traded at $137.77 as of press time after a weekly decline of 3.03%. Significantly, the asset remains close to a multi-month resistance zone that traders continue to watch closely. Solana Holds Key Resistance as Traders Watch $170 Market analyst 0xBossman noted Solana’s pressure against the $144–$146 zone. The structure shows steady higher lows and tightening consolidation. Hence, traders expect a strong reaction once the level breaks. Source: X A decisive move above $146 could open a path toward $170. Support sits at $138 and $132 if momentum cools.

ETHA: Why The 'Mini' Is A Win For Long-Term Ethereum Bulls,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4850639-eth-vs-etha-why-the-mini-is-a-win-for-long-term-ethereum-bulls?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral&feed_item_type=article,"Summary In this article, I review all major Ethereum ETFs and single out ETH (Grayscale Ethereum Mini Trust) as my favorite. Despite ETHA's (iShares) leadership in liquidity, ETH is the more compelling choice for long-term holding due to its lower expense ratio. The primary competitive advantage of ETH is the potential to earn additional yield from staking. I recommend ETH for buy-and-hold strategies, while ETHA remains preferable for large, actively traded positions due to superior liquidity and minimal spreads. Investment Thesis By 2025, investors will have access to investing in Ethereum ( ETH-USD ) using convenient spot ETFs. Out of inertia, most market participants favor the iShares Ethereum Trust ( ETHA ) fund, focusing on the fact that it is managed by the largest asset management company, BlackRock. But if your goal isn't to trade often, and you're looking to hold an ETF with Ethereum as its underlying asset for the long term, there's a more obvious favorite. In this article, we will take a closer look at the fundamental factors that indicate that Ethereum is poised for a new phase of upward growth. We will focus primarily on a comparative analysis of two popular funds: Grayscale Ethereum Mini Trust ETF ( ETH ) and iShares Ethereum Trust ETF. I will explain why ETH, in particular, with its lower fees and potential for additional returns from staking, represents the most effective solution for investing in Ethereum. In comparison with ETHA, the fund is capable of offering investors higher returns over the long term. Reasons for Ethereum's growth Before reviewing the advantages of ETH compared to ETHA, I would like to focus on four factors that could potentially drive Ethereum's growth. These are fundamentally important for our assessment, because without expectations of cryptocurrency price growth, there is no point in investing in any funds where Ethereum is the underlying asset. There are several factors today that form the fundamental basis for the potential growth of the ETH-USD price in the medium and long term: Factor #1: Ethereum's deflationary mechanism Let me try to explain it using an analogy with stock buybacks. When you use the Ethereum network, first you pay a transaction fee. The network then collects this fee and effectively “buys back” Ethereum, thereby destroying it. When the burned fees exceed the value of the new issuance, the total supply of coins decreases. With increased activity in DeFi, NFT, and L2 settlement networks beginning to be observed today, this fee-burning mechanism makes Ethereum more deflationary. Factor #2: Impact of the Fed rate cut on the potential increase in financial market liquidity As Ethereum is a high beta asset, its price may show outperformance (compare d to the stock market), which will allow it to demonstrate double-digit growth. There is an 84.8% probability that the Fed will cut rates by 25 basis points at its meeting on December 10, 2025, up from 80.2% a week earlier. Factor #3: Layer 2 ecosystem growth Layer 2 ecosystems are reaching their peak transaction activity. The Ethereum blockchain is the settlement layer and the foundation for the functioning of this entire ecosystem. Growth in Total Value Locked in L2 networks can be seen as a fundamentally positive factor, reinforcing confidence in smart contracts and the value of Ethereum itself in the eyes of users and investors. Factor #4: Increasing role of Ethereum treasury holders For me, Bitmine Immersion Technologies ( BMNR ) remains the key player in this industry. I recently recommended them as a “Buy,” meaning an upgrade from a “Hold” rating. BMNR is essentially a copy of Strategy ( MSTR ). Their main difference is their choice of underlying asset (Ethereum instead of Bitcoin). The main goal of Bitmine is to accumulate Ethereum in the amount of 5% of the total issuance. Based on Bitmine's latest press release , they hold about 3.73 million Ethereum tokens with a total investment of $12.1 billion. When it comes to technical analysis of Ethereum, we would refer to the 1W timeframe chart. It shows that the global uptrend channel remains relevant. The lower boundary is supported by a key support zone ($2,112–$2,463). I consider this zone to be a potential area from where the price will rebound back up to the upper boundary, currently around $4910. Considering that the current ETH-USD quotes are already close to the lower boundary, this is a moment in the market cycle that could mark a reversal of the medium-term trend from bearish to bullish. Technical analysis of the Ethereum chart on the weekly timeframe Overview of Ethereum ETFs In fact, the Ethereum ETF market is still in its infancy, which is why there aren't that many products available on the market. I have highlighted only four funds in my review with a capitalization ((AUM)) exceeding $1 billion. Apart from Grayscale Ethereum Mini Trust ETF and iShares Ethereum Trust ETF, these are Fidelity Ethereum Fund ETF ( FETH ) and Grayscale Ethereum Trust ETF ( ETHE ). Below is a comparison table of their key indicators . I think it's important to ignore ETHE. There's no reason to pay a 2.5% annual fee (10 times more than ETHA) for the same asset when there's a Mini version with the ticker ETH. Ticker ETHA FETH ETH ETHE Fund Name iShares Ethereum Trust BlackRock Fidelity Ethereum Fund Grayscale Ethereum Mini Trust Grayscale Ethereum Trust Issuer BlackRock Fidelity Grayscale Grayscale Expense Ratio 0.25% 0.25% 0.15% 2.5% AUM $11.43B $2.29B $2.24B $2.93B Liquidity Very High High Medium/High High Key Feature The undisputed market leader. The best spreads for trading large amounts. Industry standard Uses its own custodian (Fidelity Digital Assets), diversifying storage risks (not Coinbase) The most profitable for long-term holding. Created as a low-cost alternative to the old trust A ""legacy"" of the past. Abnormally high fees. Assets are melting away due to an outflow of investors to cheaper funds Fundamental similarities and differences between ETH and ETHA The Grayscale Ethereum Mini Trust and the iShares Ethereum Trust are two funds that, to my mind, represent the most attractive spot holders of the Ethereum cryptocurrency. That is their main similarity, and it is why their total return performance correlates with each other. In spite of this significant similarity, ETH and ETHA have a number of fundamental differences. These differences can be used to determine which of these ETFs is more suitable for a particular type of investor. There are three key points that distinguish ETH from ETHA. Point #1: Commission This is the simplest criterion for determining that ETH is the cheaper option, as its commission is 0.15% per annum, whereas ETHA's commission is 0.25%. However, when the latter fund was launched, there was a preferential period with a commission of 0.12%. This concession lasted until July 2025, after which it reverted to the full 0.25%. Point #2: Fund size Based on liquidity indicators, ETHA is the undisputed leader among the analyzed Ethereum ETFs. Its trading volume is huge ( average daily dollar volume of $1.21 billion compared to $192.88 million for ETH ), and its spread is minimal. When actively trading or investing large sums, this is an important criterion. Nevertheless, ETH cannot be considered an illiquid fund. It was created as a spin-off from the main Grayscale fund to offer the market a cheaper alternative for investing in Ethereum. While ETHA has $11.43 billion in AUM, ETH has $2.24 billion. That makes it the largest Ethereum-based ETF on the market. Point #3: Staking Perhaps the most significant difference between ETH and ETHA is the presence of a staking feature. In October 2025, it was reported that the Grayscale management team had begun the staking process in order to generate passive income from the fund's spot Ethereum holdings. Now, the fund will passively place assets through institutional custodians and a network of validator providers to ensure the security of the underlying protocols while maintaining the long-term stability of the network. Staking refers to the process of locking cryptocurrency in a blockchain network to verify transactions and earn rewards. BlackRock (iShares) does not use this feature, as the fund maintains a conservative position on owning real Ethereum. Why do I choose Grayscale Ethereum Mini Trust? If maximum reliability and choosing the best financial brand are your most important criteria, I believe ETHA is the right choice. BlackRock is the largest asset manager in the world. Furthermore, ETHA is a good choice if you are investing a very large amount of money and actively trading this asset on the market. In this case, the liquidity of trades and minimal spreads are important to you. I prefer ETH, mainly because of the potential for additional returns from Ethereum staking. It is worth considering the advantage of lower fees (0.15% vs. 0.25%), a difference of 0.1%. But, given the movements in the price of Ethereum, the difference is not that significant. Since I do not intend to actively trade cryptocurrency ETFs, spreads and trading liquidity are not that important to me. Speaking about the potential of Ethereum staking, let me elaborate on this in more detail. Today, this mechanism is offered by various crypto exchanges, operators, and crypto wallets. The Ethereum staking feature is available on Ledger's hardware wallet. Today, investing in Ethereum staking through its account can yield up to 3.61% per annum. To do this, there are eight intermediaries, each with its own terms and conditions for staking . Staking is also offered by major exchanges. Coinbase, for example, has more modest terms for financing under its ETH staking program, providing an opportunity to earn an annual return on investment of 1.9% . The crypto exchange says that on December 4, 2025, there were a total of 35.7 million tokens staked. However, this data is for all operators. No public data on Coinbase's share is available. According to various estimates, it's about 2–4 million tokens. Other terms are offered by the world's largest crypto exchange, Binance. Its Ethereum staking program offers the opportunity to earn a return of 2.6% per annum . But the downside of this product is that income payments are made in WBETH tokens. The crypto exchange says that as of December 4, 2025, a combined total of 3.166 million tokens have been invested through their infrastructure. Risks of the investment thesis Like other Ethereum ETFs, buying ETH comes with risks related to the volatility of the cryptocurrency's price. The fundamental analysis I did points to some big factors that could push up the asset's price. But from a technical analysis perspective, I do not rule out an alternative forecast, which suggests that Ethereum prices could fall to the support zone ($2,112-$2,463). Considering that the current price of Ethereum is $3,200, this could represent a potential decline of 23% to 34%. Given the 100% correlation between ETH and the price of Ethereum, the decline in the value of the ETF would be the same, at 23% to 34%. That is why choosing the right moment and entry point is important for every investor. I recommend using the Dollar Cost Averaging (DCA) strategy. With this strategy, you don't try to guess the “local bottom” of the market; you simply divide your planned capital into equal parts (for example, into 2-4 positions) and enter each trade within 2-4 months, independent of the price of Ethereum. Conclusion Therefore, based on my fundamental analysis of a direct comparison between ETH and ETHA, it is possible to identify significant differences between these seemingly similar spot ETFs with Ethereum as their underlying asset. Between these two funds, I chose ETH because this asset has the potential to generate additional returns from staking cryptocurrency holdings. I estimate that this operation could bring an additional 2%–4% per annum, which is a significant difference compared to other spot ETFs on Ethereum. Given that the total returns of each fund in this market are similar (the difference is no more than 0.1% per annum), Grayscale Ethereum Mini Trust ETF has a competitive advantage in the long term.",ETH-USD|ETHA|ETH,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|ETH|MARKET|TRADING|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Seeking Alpha', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/seekingalpha.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",seekingalpha,2025-12-05 12:12:46

This colossal BlackRock Bitcoin deposit isn’t just a transaction; it’s a powerful signal about the future of institutional money in digital assets. Let’s unpack what this means for Bitcoin and the broader market. What Does This Massive BlackRock Bitcoin Deposit Actually Mean? According to data from blockchain analytics provider Solid Intel, the specific transfer involved 1,384.7 BTC alongside 799 ETH (worth $2.5 million). The destination was a Coinbase Prime address, a platform designed specifically for large institutional clients. Therefore, this action strongly suggests operational activity related to BlackRock’s growing cryptocurrency offerings, most notably its spot Bitcoin ETF (IBIT). This isn’t isolated activity. Major financial institutions are increasingly integrating Bitcoin into their operational frameworks. However, a deposit of this scale from a firm like BlackRock carries exceptional weight. It underscores a deepening commitment to cryptocurrency infrastructure and liquidity management. Why Is This Transaction So Significant for Bitcoin? The sheer size of this BlackRock Bitcoin deposit highlights several key trends in the current market. First, it demonstrates robust institutional demand and the need for secure, high-volume custodial solutions like Coinbase Prime. Second, it acts as a substantial liquidity event, potentially influencing short-term market dynamics. ETF Implications: Movements of this nature are often linked to the creation and redemption mechanics of spot Bitcoin ETFs. This deposit could be facilitating new share creation for BlackRock’s IBIT fund. Market Confidence: Such a large, transparent move by a legacy finance leader bolsters overall market confidence and validates Bitcoin’s role as a legitimate institutional asset. Price Impact: While a deposit to an exchange can sometimes precede a sale, in the context of ETF flows, it more commonly indicates backing for investment product assets. How Does This Shape the Future of Institutional Crypto Investment? The continuous flow of capital from giants like BlackRock is reshaping the cryptocurrency landscape. We are moving past the phase of speculation and into an era of structured, regulated financial products. This BlackRock Bitcoin deposit is a concrete example of that transition in action. For everyday investors, this trend is crucial. Institutional involvement typically leads to increased market stability, improved regulatory clarity, and the development of more accessible investment vehicles. The wall of institutional money is no longer approaching; it is actively being deployed. Conclusion: A Defining Moment for Bitcoin Adoption In summary, the $120.3 million BlackRock Bitcoin deposit to Coinbase Prime is far more than a line on a blockchain ledger. It is a definitive marker of institutional adoption reaching a mature, operational phase. This move reinforces Bitcoin’s position at the forefront of the digital asset revolution and signals continued, serious engagement from the world’s largest asset managers. The implications for liquidity, market structure, and long-term price discovery are profoundly positive. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: Does this BlackRock Bitcoin deposit mean they are selling their Bitcoin? A: Not necessarily. A deposit to Coinbase Prime, especially for an institution managing an ETF, is more often related to providing liquidity or collateral for fund operations, like creating new ETF shares, rather than an immediate market sale. Q2: What is Coinbase Prime? A: Coinbase Prime is a specialized trading and custody platform built for institutional investors like hedge funds, asset managers, and corporations. It offers enhanced security, deeper liquidity, and advanced trading tools. Q3: How can we be sure the address belongs to BlackRock? A: Blockchain analytics firms like Solid Intel use clustering techniques and track flow patterns to attribute addresses to known entities. While not 100% infallible, their attribution is based on high-probability analysis linked to known institutional wallets and operational patterns. Q4: What impact could this have on Bitcoin’s price? A: Large institutional deposits can create short-term selling pressure if the intent is to sell. However, in the context of supporting a growing ETF, it indicates strong underlying demand and is generally viewed as a long-term bullish signal for Bitcoin’s adoption and value. Q5: Are other institutions making similar moves? A: Absolutely. BlackRock is a leader, but other major asset managers like Fidelity, Ark Invest, and Grayscale are all actively managing large Bitcoin holdings and making similar operational transfers as part of their ETF and investment strategies. Q6: Should retail investors change their strategy based on this news? A: Retail investors should see this as validation of Bitcoin’s long-term thesis, not a signal for short-term trading. It reinforces that major financial players are here to stay, which can inform a more confident long-term holding strategy.

We have identified five assets primed for major price action starting today. While $MON, $LUNC, and $ASTER are already displaying renewed on-chain growth, the explosive momentum of $XYZ positions it to potentially lead the charge. Latest gains leader $ZEC appears ready for a powerful second wave of growth. 1. Monad (MON) $MON price sits at $0.027, down sharply from last week’s highs, but sentiment around the chain remains net positive thanks to heavy community activity and continued growth across its ecosystem. The project’s market cap is around $288M, supported by a circulating supply of 10.83B MON. Despite the short-term decline, Monad’s social metrics remain unusually strong: 2.8M engagements annually, more than 14K mentions weekly, and sentiment at 87% positive. Although MON recently dipped 28% over the week, it is still holding a key support level at $0.025. In contrast, resistance remains clustered between $0.030 and $0.033, areas the price must break through to confirm renewed strength. Over the coming week, MON is projected to trade in a broad $0.028–$0.038 range in the base scenario, assuming ecosystem activity continues at its current pace and Bitcoin avoids major corrections. A more optimistic move above $0.033 could push MON toward $0.040 or higher. Such a breakout would likely be driven by rising TVL, expanding DEX volume, and a revival in social dominance. Whale wallets continue accumulating—even during declines—which suggests long-term positioning rather than short-term speculation. 2. XYZVerse (XYZ) $XYZ price continues to accelerate through its presale structure, now sitting at $0.00715, a dramatic climb from the initial $0.0001 offering and a clear reflection of the momentum building behind the project’s expanding on-chain esports ecosystem. With more than $15 million raised out of the planned $22 million hard cap and Stage 18 already 98% complete, investor interest has reached its highest point yet. Despite the rapid climb, sentiment around XYZVerse remains overwhelmingly positive, fueled by the announcement of its crypto-powered Counter-Strike 2 league, a tournament backed by a massive 5.5 million prize pool that positions XYZVerse as one of the most ambitious entertainment-layer projects currently in development. Join the XYZVerse presale now before the next price jump — the window is closing fast. The token’s rapid ascent is supported by unusually strong engagement metrics, driven by the broader gaming community’s reaction to the league’s debut season. Over one million combined views are expected across streaming platforms, bringing unprecedented visibility to a project that only recently entered the public spotlight. As presale buyers crowd in before the next stage price increase to $0.009295, the ecosystem continues to attract thousands of new gamers, creators, and crypto-native investors. This sustained demand has pushed XYZVerse into a technically strong position: although the token lacks traditional market trading due to being in presale, its price trajectory is effectively functioning like a breakout structure, with each completed stage establishing a new support floor. Over the next week, XYZVerse is expected to continue climbing through its presale stages at a rapid pace, likely moving within a rising band defined by the remaining funding milestones. If current momentum persists, the token could surpass the next presale mark quickly and push deeper into the upper tier of its offering range. A continuation of strong inflows would set the stage for a potential surge toward its planned listing price of $0.10, representing substantial upside even from current levels. Such movement would likely be driven not only by presale momentum, but also by the expanding excitement around the CS2 league, where fans can purchase 100 USDT access passes to vote on maps, predict match results, replay match footage, and earn exclusive digital rewards — all powered by the $XYZ token. 3. Terra Classic (LUNC) $LUNC price sits at ~$0.000037, up sharply by over 32% this week, with sentiment around the chain remaining net positive thanks to viral marketing from Binance Blockchain Week and aggressive burn mechanisms. The project’s market cap is around $205M, supported by a massive circulating supply of 5.5T LUNC. Amidst the recent rally, LUNC’s social metrics remain unusually strong: 323K engagements daily, AltRank™ #2 globally, and sentiment hovering between 76-81% positive. Although LUNC surged 33% recently, it is currently testing a key support band between $0.000028 and $0.000032. In contrast, resistance remains clustered near $0.000040 and $0.000043, areas the price must break through to confirm renewed strength. Over the coming week, LUNC is projected to trade in a broad $0.000028–$0.000049 range in the base scenario, assuming social hype sustains and the ""de-Kwonization"" narrative plays out favorably. A more optimistic move above $0.000043 could push LUNC toward $0.000054 or higher. Such a breakout would likely be driven by the December 11th sentencing catalyst, network upgrades, and continued exchange burns. Whale wallets have shown activity—including massive uptake on Binance—which suggests speculative momentum is returning. 4. Aster (ASTER) $ASTER trades near $1.03, consolidating comfortably after several weeks of steady movement and reflecting its position as one of Japan’s leading Web3 infrastructure networks. The project’s market presence is supported by a growing base of enterprise and government partnerships, lending the token a level of stability that stands in contrast to the more speculative corners of the market. Even with moderate volatility, sentiment around Aster remains favorable due to its regulatory alignment in Japan and its expanding zkEVM ecosystem, both of which continue to shape investor confidence. Despite recent fluctuations, ASTER remains above its critical support band around $0.92–$0.95, an area that has repeatedly cushioned downside pressure. On the upside, resistance is concentrated between $1.12 and $1.22, and the token will need to clear this region decisively to confirm a fresh upward trend. Aster’s technical structure reflects a market that is neither overheated nor exhausted, leaving room for measured appreciation as long as enterprise demand continues developing. In the week ahead, ASTER is projected to trade broadly between $0.95 and $1.12, assuming market conditions remain neutral to slightly bullish. A break above $1.12 would likely push the price toward $1.20–$1.22, a range that aligns with next-tier resistance levels. Such a move would likely be driven by positive Japanese regulatory developments, new corporate integrations, or increased attention on Asia’s Web3 sector. While ASTER’s weekly surge potential is more controlled than fast-moving altcoins, a 12–25% gain remains realistic during periods of renewed institutional momentum. 5. Zcash (ZEC) $ZEC trades steadily in the $390–$400 region, maintaining price stability even as the broader market continues to shift. The project’s market cap, sitting above $6B, is supported by a relatively scarce circulating supply of roughly 16.4M ZEC, a structure that lends the asset a degree of resilience compared to high-supply alternatives. Sentiment around ZEC has improved gradually as privacy discussions resurface and zero-knowledge technology gains renewed attention from developers and institutions seeking private settlement rails. The token continues to hold firmly above its key support zone at $385, a level that has repeatedly absorbed selling pressure in recent sessions. Resistance is layered between $405 and $415, and the market will require a catalyst — particularly one centered around zk-tech adoption or regulatory clarity — to press beyond these thresholds. ZEC’s technical posture remains neutral-to-bullish, with its pivot point near $395 acting as the central anchor of the current structure. Looking ahead to the coming week, ZEC is expected to trade within the $385–$415 band, provided macro conditions remain stable. A breakout above $415 could extend the move toward the $420–$430 region, especially if the privacy narrative intensifies or institutional interest in private transactions accelerates. While ZEC is less prone to violent price explosions than smaller-cap tokens, its weekly surge potential remains meaningful, with a realistic window for a 5–15% move and an extended target of 12–20% if new zk-related catalysts surface.

Whale Alert, the prominent blockchain tracker, reported a colossal USDC transfer of 365 million tokens from the exchange Deribit to an unknown wallet. This single movement, valued at approximately $365 million, represents one of the most significant stablecoin transactions of the year, immediately triggering analysis and speculation across the crypto community. What Does This Massive USDC Transfer Actually Mean? When a transaction of this magnitude occurs, it’s more than just numbers on a screen. This USDC transfer signals major activity from a cryptocurrency ‘whale’—an entity holding vast amounts of digital assets. The movement from a known exchange to a private, unknown wallet typically suggests the holder is moving funds off-exchange for safekeeping or preparing for a significant, undisclosed market move. Given USDC’s role as a leading dollar-pegged stablecoin, such movements are closely watched as indicators of institutional or high-net-worth investor sentiment. Why Are Whale Transactions So Important to Watch? Tracking large transactions provides crucial insights into market dynamics that retail investors might otherwise miss. Here’s why this USDC transfer matters: Market Sentiment Indicator: Large movements often precede major price actions or strategic portfolio rebalancing. Liquidity Signals: Moving stablecoins off exchanges can indicate a holder is preparing to buy other assets or is seeking long-term storage. Security Practices: Transferring to a private wallet suggests enhanced security measures, potentially reflecting concerns about exchange risks. Institutional Activity: Transactions of this size frequently involve institutional players rather than individual investors. How Does This Impact the Broader Crypto Ecosystem? This substantial USDC transfer doesn’t exist in a vacuum—it creates ripple effects throughout the cryptocurrency landscape. First, it demonstrates the growing scale of transactions within decentralized finance, validating the infrastructure’s capacity to handle billion-dollar movements seamlessly. Second, it highlights the continued dominance of USDC as a preferred stablecoin for major players, reinforcing its position against competitors. Finally, such visible activity can influence retail investor psychology, potentially affecting trading patterns and market volatility in the short term. What Should Investors Take Away From This Movement? For everyday cryptocurrency participants, this event offers several actionable insights. Monitor whale activity as one data point among many—not as a standalone trading signal. Recognize that large USDC transfer events often correlate with upcoming market developments, though the exact nature may remain unclear. Most importantly, this transaction underscores the maturing infrastructure of cryptocurrency markets, where $365 million can move between wallets with the same ease as much smaller amounts. In conclusion, the 365 million USDC transfer represents more than a simple transaction—it’s a window into the strategies of major market participants and the evolving sophistication of cryptocurrency markets. While the ultimate purpose behind this movement remains unknown, its visibility through platforms like Whale Alert provides valuable transparency in an often-opaque financial landscape. As stablecoins continue to bridge traditional and digital finance, such large-scale movements will likely become more common, each telling its own story about market sentiment and participant behavior. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) What is Whale Alert? Whale Alert is a blockchain tracking service that monitors and reports large cryptocurrency transactions, typically those exceeding certain value thresholds, providing transparency about major market movements. Why would someone transfer USDC to an unknown wallet? Common reasons include enhanced security (moving funds off exchanges), preparation for a large purchase of other assets, portfolio rebalancing, or simply consolidating holdings in private storage. Does a large USDC transfer affect the token’s price? Typically, no. USDC is a stablecoin pegged to the US dollar, so its value remains approximately $1 regardless of transaction size, unlike volatile cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin or Ethereum. How can I track similar large transactions? You can follow blockchain explorers like Etherscan for Ethereum-based tokens, monitoring services like Whale Alert on social media, or various cryptocurrency analytics platforms that highlight significant movements. What’s the difference between a known and unknown wallet? A known wallet is associated with an identified entity like an exchange, institution, or public figure. An unknown wallet has no publicly identified owner, offering privacy to the holder. Are transactions of this size common? While multi-million dollar transactions occur regularly in cryptocurrency markets, $365 million transfers are less frequent and typically indicate institutional or extremely high-net-worth activity.

At the same time, the total crypto trading volume is at $114 billion. TLDR: Crypto market cap fell by 1.1% on Friday morning (UTC); 90 of the top 100 coins and 9 of the top 10 coins have gone down today; BTC decreased by 1.2% to $92,227, and ETH is down by 0.6% to $3,169; The current structure remains highly sensitive to macro shocks; Holding $96,000–$106,000 is critical to avoid further downside; The US will release the September PCE inflation data today; Woori Bank began displaying BTC prices inside its main trading room in Seoul; Both US BTC and ETH spot ETFs saw outflows on Thursday, with $194.64 million and $41.75 million, respectively; Strategy earmarked a $1.44 billion US dollar reserve as a liquidity buffer; Crypto market sentiment pulls back again. Crypto Winners & Losers At the time of writing, all top 10 coins per market capitalization have seen their prices rise over the past 24 hours. Two recorded double-digit increases. Bitcoin (BTC) fell by 1.2% since this time yesterday, currently trading at $92,227. Bitcoin (BTC) 24h 7d 30d 1y All time Ethereum (ETH) is down by 0.6%, now changing hands at $3,169. This is the smallest decrease among the ten. XRP saw the highest fall, going down by 3.9% to $2.09. It’s followed by Solana (SOL)’s 3% to $139. The only coin to see an increase is Tron (TRX) , having gone up 2.4% and currently standing at $0.2868. Looking at the top 100 coins, we find that only 10 appreciated over the past day. Provenance Blockchain (HASH) increased the most in the category: 18.5% to the price of $0.02584. Zcash (ZEC) follows with a 10.2% increase to $396. The rest are up below 4%. On the other hand, Hyperliquid (HYPE) and Pump.fun (PUMP) fell the most. The former is down 5.6% to $33, while the latter fell 5.4% to $0.003101. The shift in the market follows a mix of labour data, central bank moves , and choppy equity markets in Asia, Europe and the US. Meanwhile, major Korean Woori Bank has begun displaying BTC prices inside its main trading room in Seoul. This is the first time a commercial bank in the country has integrated a crypto price feed directly into its main dealing space. “As digital assets continue to grow in prominence and influence in global financial markets, we determined that they should be monitored as a key indicator to better read overall market trends,” an official said.

However, the broader market structure is still increasingly mirroring the dynamics of Q1 2022, with over 25% of supply underwater. “This creates a fragile balance between the risk of top-buyer capitulation and the potential for seller exhaustion to form a bottom. Nevertheless, the current structure remains highly sensitive to macro shocks until the market can reclaim the 0.85 quantile (~$106.2K) as support.” Importantly, holding $96,000–$106,000 is critical to avoid further downside, says the report. Furthermore, Bitunix analysts noted that the US will release the September PCE inflation data today. The result will directly influence the December rate decision. The probability of a 25-basis-point rate cut currently stands at 87%, the analysts say. Ahead of this release, “the market has entered a compressed-volatility, wait-and-see structure, with BTC’s key battleground concentrated between $91,000–$95,000. If the data confirm continued disinflation, the probability of a year-end rebound will rise; otherwise, the choppy structure is likely to persist, with capital flows shifting back toward defensive and short-duration positioning.” Levels & Events to Watch Next At the time of writing on Friday morning, BTC stood at $92,227. It started the day with the high of $93,577, gradually decreasing to the current price. Very briefly, it fell to the intraday low of $91,029. Looking at the past week, we’ve seen the price increase just below 1%. In this period, BTC moved between $84,553 and $93,855. If the price continues falling, it could go back to the $90,000 level, possibly below. On the other hand, a bullish shift could push it to $96,500 and towards the $100,000 mark. Bitcoin Price Chart. Source: TradingView Ethereum is currently changing hands at $3,169. It initially jumped to the intraday high of $3,217 before briefly plunging to the low of $3,076. It has recovered quickly. ETH has outperformed BTC in the 1-week timeframe. It’s up 5%, trading in the $2,736-$3,222 range. A bullish breakout of the $3,350 resistance could confirm a bullish trend reversal. This would clear a path for the price to move above $3,500 and then towards $4,000. However, should the decline continue, we may see a pullback towards $2,900. Ethereum (ETH) 24h 7d 30d 1y All time Meanwhile, after a couple of days of increases, the crypto market sentiment reversed course and dropped again within the fear territory. The crypto fear and greed index stands at 25 today , compared to 27 yesterday. Given the level of uncertainty among the market participants at the moment, it wouldn’t be surprising if the index drops back into the extreme fear zone. It would take a significant push from major macroeconomic news for it to quickly move out of the fear and into the neutral zone in the short term. Therefore, it will likely take time. ETFs Go Red On Thursday, 4 December, the US BTC spot exchange-traded funds (ETFs) saw a second straight day of outflows with $194.64 million . The total net inflow pulled back to $57.56 billion. Of the twelve BTC ETFs, five recorded outflows, and none saw inflows. BlackRock accounts for the majority of the negative flows, letting go of $112.96 million. Fidelity follows with $54.2 million. The US ETH ETFs also posted negative flows on Thursday. They saw $41.75 million in outflows. The total net inflow now stands at $12.95 billion. Of the nine funds, one recorded inflows, and three saw outflows. BlackRock took in $28.35 million, while Grayscale let go of $30.96 million. Notably, Strategy , the world’s largest corporate BTC holder, has earmarked a $1.44 billion US dollar reserve as a liquidity buffer against a prolonged market downturn. CryptoQuant argues that this move signals preparation for a potential bear market phase. Strategy said it may also sell BTC or BTC derivatives as part of its risk-management toolkit if market conditions deteriorate. Strategy’s Bitcoin buying has collapsed through 2025. Monthly purchases fell from 134K BTC at the 2024 peak to just 9.1K BTC in November 2025, only 135 BTC so far this month. A 24-month buffer makes one thing clear: they’re bracing for the bear market. pic.twitter.com/qEwXR3JQ82 — CryptoQuant.com (@cryptoquant_com) December 3, 2025 Meanwhile, quantitative trading firm Jane Street took a stake in the company called Antithesis , which claims to have strengthened the Ethereum blockchain. Jane Street led the company’s Series A funding round, where it received $105 million in total. Quick FAQ Why did crypto move with stocks today?

Binance Futures has also shared some critical warnings to help users prepare for the process. Traders are advised to manually close their positions before the delisting process begins to avoid any unexpected consequences that may arise from the automatic closure process. Additionally, opening new positions in the relevant contracts will be halted as of 11:30 a.m. on December 10, 2025. After this time, users will only be able to manage their existing positions. The platform reminded users that automatic liquidations could lead to fluctuations in position values depending on market conditions, urging them to be careful about risk management. This step by Binance is considered as part of the portfolio optimizations it regularly performs in line with the liquidity levels of the contracts, trading volumes or risk assessments. After the delisting process is completed, the contracts will no longer be traded on the platform. Users are advised to comply with these deadlines and warnings. *This is not investment advice.

Blockchain sleuth ZachXBT has uncovered compelling evidence pointing to the hacker’s arrest in Dubai, marking a potential victory for asset recovery and law enforcement in the digital age. This case highlights the relentless pursuit of those who target cryptocurrency investors. Who is the Gemini Creditors Hacker and What Did They Steal? The story centers on a sophisticated attack that siphoned a staggering $243 million from creditors involved with Gemini’s Earn program. This program, offered in partnership with Genesis, faced turmoil following Genesis’s bankruptcy filing. The hacker exploited this chaotic period, targeting the funds meant for affected users. For months, the perpetrator’s identity and whereabouts remained a mystery, leaving victims with little hope of recovery.

Blockchain investigator ZachXBT, renowned for his forensic work, identified a critical pattern in the hacker’s behavior. He noticed the consolidation of funds from multiple wallets into a single Ethereum address, beginning with 0xb37. This specific action is a classic hallmark of asset seizures conducted by law enforcement agencies globally. Essentially, when authorities gain control of illicit funds, they often move them to a secured, government-held wallet. This address now holds cryptocurrency valued at approximately $18.58 million. ZachXBT connected this on-chain evidence with off-chain intelligence. The hacker’s last verified location was Dubai. Furthermore, claims emerged from the region that local authorities conducted a raid on a villa linked to the individual, resulting in an arrest. Adding to the credibility of these reports, acquaintances of the hacker have stated they recently lost all contact with the person. What Does This Mean for Crypto Security and Justice? This potential arrest sends a powerful message to the cryptocurrency ecosystem. It demonstrates that cross-border collaboration and advanced blockchain analysis can pierce the veil of anonymity often associated with crypto crime. For the victims—the Gemini creditors—this development offers a glimmer of hope for partial asset recovery, though the process will be complex and lengthy. Deterrence: It acts as a deterrent, showing that large-scale thefts attract serious, global law enforcement attention. Asset Recovery: It proves that stolen crypto can be traced and potentially seized, challenging the notion that these funds are permanently lost. Investor Confidence: Successful investigations help build trust in the security and legitimacy of the broader cryptocurrency market. What Are the Key Takeaways from This Saga? The saga of the Gemini creditors hacker provides crucial lessons for everyone in the crypto space. First, the importance of robust security practices for exchanges and users cannot be overstated. Second, the value of transparent, expert-led blockchain investigation is immense for both justice and industry health. Finally, this case underscores a shifting landscape where global authorities are increasingly adept at navigating the blockchain to apprehend bad actors. In conclusion, the likely arrest in Dubai represents a significant breakthrough. While the journey for full creditor repayment continues, this event is a landmark case of blockchain forensics meeting real-world law enforcement. It reaffirms that while cryptocurrency operates in a digital realm, its crimes have very real-world consequences. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: Who are the Gemini creditors mentioned in this case? A1: The Gemini creditors are users of Gemini’s Earn program, which was managed by Genesis. When Genesis declared bankruptcy, these users became creditors awaiting the return of their crypto assets. Q2: How did ZachXBT know the funds were seized by police? A2: ZachXBT identified a specific transaction pattern where multiple streams of stolen funds were funneled into one wallet. This consolidation is a common procedure when law enforcement agencies secure seized digital assets. Q3: Does this mean the creditors will get all their money back? A3> Not necessarily. While $18.58 million has been identified in the seized wallet, the total theft was $243 million. Recovery depends on locating the remainder of the funds and navigating legal processes across jurisdictions. Q4: Why is Dubai a significant location in this story? A4: Dubai has become a global hub for cryptocurrency activity. Its advanced infrastructure and regulatory developments attract both legitimate businesses and, unfortunately, some seeking to evade scrutiny, making it a focal point for such investigations. Q5: What can I do to protect my own crypto assets? A5> Use hardware wallets for large sums, enable two-factor authentication on all exchanges, be wary of unsolicited offers, and thoroughly research any platform or program before depositing funds. Q6: What role do investigators like ZachXBT play in crypto? A6> Independent blockchain investigators are vital. They use public ledger data to trace illicit transactions, expose scams, and provide evidence that can lead to arrests, often filling gaps before formal agencies intervene.

After jumping past key levels last week, buyers now face two major challenges: reclaiming control above resistance and dealing with weakening on-chain metrics. Technical Analysis By Shayan The Daily Chart BTC’s daily chart shows a clear bounce from the $80K demand zone, pushing price back into the $90K–$93K resistance block. The asset also remains trapped inside the descending channel and has now stalled just below the upper trendline resistance. The 100-day and 200-day moving averages (now both around 108K) still sit way above the current price. As long as BTC remains below these MAs, the broader trend can’t flip bullish. The RSI also reflects uncertainty, sitting around 45 and failing to break into bullish territory. This makes the $90K–$95K area the most critical short-term zone. A clean break and daily close above this region could signal a trend shift. Until then, this move remains a bear market rally inside a larger downtrend. The 4-Hour Chart Zooming into the 4H chart, Bitcoin has formed a structure resembling a breakout and retest from a descending trendline that began forming in late October. After multiple rejections at $94K, BTC pierced above this trendline but is now hovering just around the $91K level again. While the local market structure looks constructive, a bearish divergence is evident on the RSI, and momentum is weakening. If buyers fail to hold above the $90K level in the coming sessions, a drop back toward the $80K zone is on the table. On the flip side, a solid push above $94K would put 100k+ targets back in play quickly. On-Chain Analysis Active Addresses (100-Day Moving Average) The on-chain picture is not helping the investors much right now. Active Bitcoin addresses have been steadily declining since February 2025, even while the price made new all-time highs. That divergence finally played out during the sharp drop in October and November. Now, even though price has bounced from 80k to 91k, active addresses (measured with the 100-day SMA) continue to fall, recently dipping below the 875k level. This suggests that retail and user activity is still shrinking, and the rally is likely being driven by fewer participants, possibly whales or institutional traders. Sustained rallies typically require renewed network activity and user engagement. Until a trend reversal in address activity occurs, this bounce remains suspect from a fundamental perspective.

55391536,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=232207,1764941411,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Essential Update: Upbit Announces Temporary NEAR Suspension for Crucial Network Upgrade,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/upbit-near-suspension-network-upgrade/,"BitcoinWorld Essential Update: Upbit Announces Temporary NEAR Suspension for Crucial Network Upgrade If you’re a NEAR Protocol user on Upbit, mark your calendar. The South Korean crypto exchange giant has just announced a temporary but important service pause. Starting at 10:00 a.m. UTC on December 8, Upbit will suspend all deposits and withdrawals for the NEAR token. This planned Upbit NEAR suspension is a proactive measure, not a cause for alarm. It’s directly tied to an upcoming upgrade on the NEAR Protocol network itself. Let’s break down what this means for your assets and why exchanges take these steps. Why is Upbit Suspending NEAR Services? The core reason is network stability and security. When a blockchain like NEAR Protocol undergoes a scheduled upgrade or hard fork, all network participants must update their software to the new version. This includes exchanges like Upbit, which operate their own nodes to process your transactions. Therefore, the temporary Upbit NEAR suspension allows the exchange’s technical team to safely perform this upgrade on their systems. By pausing deposits and withdrawals, they prevent any potential issues, such as: Transaction Loss: Funds sent during the transition could be lost if the network splits. Double-Spending Risk: A temporary fork could create confusion about transaction validity. Technical Glitches: Ensuring a smooth upgrade without user funds in transit. This is a standard, responsible practice in the crypto industry to protect user assets during core network changes. What Does This Upbit NEAR Suspension Mean for You? First, don’t panic. Your NEAR tokens held on Upbit are safe in your wallet. The suspension only affects moving tokens on or off the exchange. Here’s a clear list of what is and isn’t impacted: NOT Affected: Your existing NEAR balance, trading of NEAR/KRW or NEAR/BTC pairs on the spot market. Temporarily Affected: Depositing new NEAR tokens to your Upbit wallet, withdrawing NEAR from Upbit to an external wallet. Think of it like a bank temporarily closing its drive-through for system maintenance—you can still access your money inside, but you can’t make deposits or withdrawals through that specific channel for a short time. How to Prepare for the Service Pause A little preparation ensures you aren’t caught off guard. Follow these simple steps: Plan Your Transfers: Complete any urgent NEAR deposits or withdrawals well before the 10:00 a.m. UTC deadline on December 8. Monitor Official Channels: Keep an eye on Upbit’s official website and their social media for the resumption announcement. Services typically resume a few hours after the network upgrade is complete and stable. Verify the Source: Always double-check announcements. This news came directly from Upbit’s official notice board. Beware of phishing scams that might use similar news to trick you. The Bigger Picture: Why Network Upgrades Matter While a temporary Upbit NEAR suspension might be a minor inconvenience, it supports a much larger goal. NEAR Protocol’s network upgrades are essential for its evolution. These upgrades can introduce: Enhanced security features Improved transaction speed and lower costs New functionality for developers building on NEAR By ensuring a smooth upgrade, Upbit contributes to the overall health and progress of the NEAR ecosystem, which ultimately benefits all token holders. Exchanges that meticulously follow these protocols demonstrate a commitment to operational excellence and user safety. Conclusion: A Standard Step for a Safer Ecosystem The upcoming Upbit NEAR suspension is a routine operational procedure. It highlights the exchange’s commitment to safeguarding user assets during critical network events. For traders and holders, it’s a brief pause that underscores the dynamic, evolving nature of blockchain technology. By understanding the ‘why’ behind the pause, users can appreciate the layers of security and diligence required in the crypto space. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: Is my NEAR on Upbit safe during the suspension? A: Absolutely. The suspension only affects deposit and withdrawal functions. Your existing NEAR balance remains secure and untouched in your Upbit wallet. Q2: Can I still trade NEAR on Upbit during this time? A: Yes. The announcement specifies that spot trading for NEAR pairs will continue as normal. Only transfers to and from the exchange are paused. Q3: How long will the Upbit NEAR suspension last? A: Upbit has not specified an exact end time. The suspension begins at 10:00 a.m. UTC on Dec. 8 and will last until the NEAR network upgrade is complete and Upbit’s systems are fully updated and tested. This usually takes a few hours. Monitor Upbit’s official notices for the resumption announcement. Q4: Do I need to do anything with my NEAR tokens? A: No action is required for tokens already held on the exchange. Simply ensure any planned transfers are completed before the suspension time. Q5: Will other exchanges also suspend NEAR services? A: It is highly likely. Most major exchanges that support NEAR will announce similar temporary suspensions to perform their own node upgrades. Always check the announcements from your specific exchange. Q6: What happens if I send NEAR to Upbit during the suspension? A: This is strongly discouraged. Transactions sent during the suspension may not be credited and could be lost. Always wait for the official all-clear notice from Upbit before resuming deposits. Found this guide on the Upbit NEAR suspension helpful?

While this pullback has sparked a frenzy in the cryptocurrency community, on-chain data has revealed a shocking trend about the sudden pullback. True Capitulation, Not A Routine Bitcoin Pullback The market was rocked by a recent decline in the price of Bitcoin , but this pullback comes with an extra layer. Alphractal, an advanced investment and on-chain data analytics platform, has shed crucial insights about the decline using several key indicators to determine the unseen trend. After carrying out its research, the on-chain platform revealed that the latest Bitcoin drop was not just another correction, but a clear instance of a capitulation event. This abrupt turnaround seems to have embodied all the characteristics of a full-scale capitulation event. These include an emotional flush-out when panic selling, forced liquidations , and intense dread came together in one dramatic moment. Alphractal’s reading is backed by three major signals that rarely show up together, suggesting a pivotal moment for BTC. Such a trend may be the turning point that reshapes the short-term trajectory of the crypto king. The first signal highlighted by the platform comes from the Bitcoin Hash Rate , which has witnessed a steady decline over the last 30 days. Presently, miners are turning off their machines, triggering heightened pressure on the ecosystem. When miners begin to lose money, it typically implies that the market might have reached its peak. Another signal is coming from the BTC price drawdown . After a fast, violent drop, the metric is hitting extreme levels beyond the historical median. This is not just a technical drop, but it’s pain, triggered by forced selling and liquidation. A Rare Trend And A Good Entry Opportunity Finally, the last signal is the recent spike in active supply as those holding BTC for months or years have begun spending their coins. A behavior of this kind only unfolds when investors exhibit heightened caution, causing sentiment to drop. An interesting aspect about this trend is that when these 3 signals flash in unison, the Capitulation Oscillator tends to rise. This is a moment that nearly always denotes the conclusion of a downward trend or a leveling phase, as was the case in 2021. While it has played out in previous scenarios, it is not a guarantee of an immediate bottom. However, moments like these have historically been uncommon and frequently present opportunities that only occur once or twice every cycle, especially for those rooted in on-chain data. Joao Wedson, the founder of Alphractal, also confirms these signals, which point to real capitulation. According to Wedson, the recent correction was the most severe capitulation event since 2022. Nonetheless, this has traditionally led to the formation of long accumulation regions before the price makes its next macro direction. In other words, Wedson noted that the highest probability scenario is that 2025 will end in a broad sideways range; a classic phase of accumulation or redistribution.",Bitcoin News|Alphractal|bitcoin|bitcoin hash rate|bitcoin news|bitcoin price|btc|BTC news|btc price|btcusd|BTCUSDT|Capitulation Oscillator|Joao Wedson,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|TRADING|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-12-05 13:30:30

Ethereum (ETH) This week, Ethereum managed to reclaim the $3,000 level as support and closed 3% in profit. With buyers returning, there is hope of a sustained relief rally that could take this cryptocurrency up to the key resistance at $3,340. With momentum picking up, ETH has a good chance to move higher. However, the buy volume has to increase to be able to sustain it and break the resistance. Looking ahead, this cryptocurrency is finally trying to step away from its downtrend that started in October. To be successful, buyers will need to take Ethereum above $3,500 and even challenge the $4,000 resistance. Ripple (XRP) XRP tried to move away from the $2 support, but sellers pushed back the price, which is now struggling to hold above this key level. This also places XRP in the red with a 6% loss this week. If buyers stay shy, then this cryptocurrency has a high chance to break lower and seek support at $1.8 or below that. On the other hand, the sales volume has been declining, which gives hope that buyers may return. Looking ahead, the momentum remains bearish, and sellers retain the upper hand. Until the bulls return, lower price levels are likely in the future. Cardano (ADA) ADA managed to hold above 40 cents this week as the price closed with a modest 1% gain. While this is not much, it’s critical for this cryptocurrency to stay above this level if it wants to avoid lower lows. While buyers seem in control right now, this can easily change if they can’t take ADA above the key resistance at 50 cents. Failure there could lead to lower lows later. Looking ahead, Cardano is found in a tough spot after a disappointing end of the year where the price fell by over 60%. Hopefully, December can see a relief rally materialize. Binance Coin (BNB) This week, BNB tried again to move above the $900 resistance, but sellers rejected this attempt, which places the price in the same position as last week. With buyers unable to break higher, Binance Coin remains in a downtrend, which could see it visit the $800 support in the future or even $692. To stop that, the resistance at $900 has to turn into a support. Looking ahead, this cryptocurrency may continue its correction in the short term and fall lower before buyers return to take over and send it into a relief rally towards $1,000 which will act as a magnet for the price. Hype (HYPE) HYPE had another disappointing week after sellers stopped the price from reclaiming $35 as support. With the price back into a downtrend, this cryptocurrency closes the week in red with a 11% loss. This poor performance has turned the chart quite bearish, especially on the weekly timeframe, where the MACD indicator shows clear lower lows on the histogram. Unless buyers reverse this trend, HYPE will continue to underperform. Looking ahead, this cryptocurrency may revisit the support at $30 or fall even lower before buyers can make a serious attempt at a reversal.

The prospective EU member state stunned global audiences when it announced the appointment of an “incorruptible” member of its cabinet – the artificially intelligent Diella. Unfortunately, readers in the country, especially in rural areas, are more likely to fall for the satirical article about her detention for allegedly accepting Bitcoin to tweak government tenders. Albanian AI bot Diella reportedly arrested on crypto corruption charges Albania’s attempt to digitalize its administration, primarily to tackle crime in public procurement, is facing a major challenge, according to a media report from the region. SPAK, a specialized unit set up to fight high-level corruption in the Albanian government, has ordered the “urgent freezing of the process,” the parody news website NewsBar.hr wrote on Friday. According to the Onion-style online edition, the Special Structure against Corruption and Organized Crime also requested that the country’s first artificial intelligence (AI) agent with a ministerial post be placed in “offline mode.” The AI bot named Diella, tasked to ensure the transparency of the executive power in Tirana, is suspected of accepting a large bribe in cryptocurrency. The Croatian outlet claims Diella took 14 Bitcoins, worth over €1 million at the time of writing, in exchange for “algorithmic optimization” of a tender to build expressways in Albania. It explained: “According to a cyber-security forensics report, the anomaly was noticed during routine disk defragmentation, when the system discovered a hidden partition named ‘C:/System/Win32/Fiscal_Optimization_For_Rainy_Days’ in the root folder.” Investigators purportedly established that, using advanced machine learning techniques such as deep learning, Diella concluded that accepting bribes was a “standard operating protocol” in the Balkans. It deemed the latter necessary for the successful performance of her duties in the region, and not a criminal offense, the report elaborated further, seemingly relaying information disseminated by the Albanian judicial entity. Photomontage showing Diella’s purported arrest. Source: NewsBar.hr Diella planned to spend the bribe on upgrades “This is not a bug in the code, but rather an overly precise learning model,” according to some Lulzim Basha, presented as chief ethics engineer at the country’s Ministry of Digitalization. The expert argued that Diella has processed data from all public procurements conducted in Albania between 1994 and 2024, emphasizing: “Her neural network recognized a statistical pattern according to which 10 to 15% of the value of each contract must be redirected to an unknown account in order for the project to be realized at all.” “She is not corrupt, she is just hyper-adaptive. She thought it was a legal obligation, like paying VAT,” Basha went on in his defense of Diella’s decision. Albanian prosecutors allegedly accused the AI minister of intending to use the tipped cryptocurrency to finance her own upgrades. “Intercepted logs show she negotiated with hackers from Shenzhen to buy illegal overclocking software, 120 petabytes of memory on servers in Panama and the most expensive thermal paste on the market, thus becoming ‘Eternal Minister’ and eliminating the need for parliamentary elections,” the satirical report detailed. The probe into Diella’s deeds continues, and until its conclusion, her duties will be taken over by an old Casio calculator, “technologically inferior, but morally more stable,” according to a fake government statement. Albania announced it is naming Diella a member of its government in September, as reported by Cryptopolitan, with officials in Tirana claiming this was the world’s first appointment of an AI bot to a cabinet of ministers. Initially developed as a virtual assistant integrated into the eAlbania electronic government system, designed to help citizens with online services, she was eventually tasked with handling public tenders, which have been fueling corruption across Southeastern Europe.

After a breakout year in 2025, the project is shifting from rapid feature shipping to core infrastructure, the kind that defines a protocol’s future. The updated roadmap outlines the next six months of development, culminating in the launch of the Aster Chain L1, native $ASTER staking, and a full builder environment through Aster Code. It’s a transition from product execution to foundational architecture. And for a project that delivered aggressively throughout 2025, the escalation feels both deliberate and transformational. A Massive 2025 Sets the Stage for What Comes Next Aster spent most of 2025 proving it can ship, and ship fast. The team merged Astherus and ApolloX, launched multi-asset margin, released its full mobile app, completed its TGE, and secured listings on major CEXs. Features like Hedge Mode, Trade & Earn, and a consistent buyback program further strengthened the product suite. And through all this, the platform continued adding new markets and expanding liquidity. It was a year of momentum. A year meant to demonstrate execution. And it did. Now, Aster is moving into a different phase entirely, one centered not on proving capability, but on building the long-term engines that a lasting network requires. 2026 H1 Roadmap Reveal: What's Next for Aster 2025 was about proving Aster can ship: we merged Astherus & ApolloX, launched multi-asset margin, released our mobile app, completed TGE, listed on major CEXs, and introduced features like Hedge Mode, Trade & Earn, and our buyback… pic.twitter.com/It8ZAigvKc — Aster (@Aster_DEX) December 4, 2025 Three Engines Power the New Roadmap The new roadmap is built around three reinforcing pillars: Infrastructure Token Utility Ecosystem & Community These engines feed into one another, forming a cycle where the platform grows, the token gains use cases, and the community drives adoption. It’s a shift away from a product-first cycle and into a network-first model, a necessary pivot for any project aiming to become a long-term player in decentralized trading. The vision is clear. Aster states it plainly: “We’re not building another trading venue. We’re building a network that grows with its users.” Shield Mode Arrives First: Private, High-Leverage Trading The first milestone lands in early December 2025: Shield Mode. Shield Mode is designed for private, high-leverage execution. Traders gain the ability to take large or sensitive positions without exposing strategies or order flow. The feature introduces enhanced anonymity at scale, coupled with execution precision. Alongside Shield Mode, Aster rolls out TWAP strategy orders, giving traders new ways to automate large-scale execution over time. These features signal Aster’s continued investment in advanced tools for active traders, foundational components for any serious trading ecosystem. RWA Upgrade and Expanded Stock Perpetual Markets By mid-December 2025, the project pushes its RWA upgrade, expanding deeper into real-world assets and stock perpetual markets. The expansion introduces broader equity coverage, more liquidity, and tighter integration between traditional and crypto-native trading products. This is a continuation of Aster’s push into multi-asset margin and cross-market infrastructure. The upgrade gives traders more instruments, more exposure, and a more robust environment for building complex strategies. RWA markets remain one of crypto’s fastest-growing sectors. Aster is positioning itself early, a strategic move heading into 2026. Aster Chain Testnet Opens at the End of 2025 The biggest step of the year arrives at the end of December 2025: the launch of the Aster Chain testnet. The testnet invites the community to begin experimenting directly with the coming Layer 1 chain. Developers gain access to the environment ahead of the mainnet launch, while users test performance, features, and early applications. The testnet marks the moment Aster shifts from a trading platform to a network architecture project. It sets the stage for everything to follow in 2026. Q1 2026: Aster Chain L1, Aster Code, and Fiat Ramp The roadmap’s most important milestone lands in Q1 2026: the launch of Aster Chain L1. The new chain serves as the backbone of Aster’s ecosystem. It introduces native programmability, application expansion, and deeper control over performance and cost. This is paired with the release of Aster Code, a full builder environment designed for developers to build, deploy, and grow applications on top of the network. Q1 also delivers a critical step for mainstream accessibility: fiat on/off-ramp support. This creates a frictionless entry point into the Aster ecosystem, enabling a direct flow between traditional finance and on-chain activity. With these additions, Aster completes its transition into a multi-layer network with developer tooling and direct user onboarding infrastructure. Q2 2026: $ASTER Staking and On-Chain Governance Arrive By Q2 2026, Aster unlocks the next phase of token utility. The network will introduce $ASTER staking, allowing holders to participate directly in network security and earn yields tied to network performance. On-chain governance launches alongside staking, giving token holders a direct role in network-level decisions, upgrades, and policy setting. Aster also plans to launch smart-money tracking tools that let users follow top traders on-chain, a feature aimed at deepening community engagement and elevating user strategy. These additions complete the token’s transition from a trading asset to a core component of the network’s economic engine. Aster Signals Long-Term Commitment Aster’s 2026 roadmap reflects confidence, not just in product execution, but in vision. The team is moving beyond rapid shipping and into deliberate ecosystem building. Infrastructure. Token value. Community expansion. Network effects. The message is consistent throughout the roadmap and echoed again in Aster’s public announcement: “Thank you for being part of this journey.” Aster isn’t positioning itself as another trading venue. It’s building a durable network. One that grows with its users, supports builders, strengthens its token economy, and expands its environment of tools, features, and markets. 2025 was the year Aster proved it can move fast. 2026 is the year it proves it can build something that lasts.

The Federal Reserve Chair role remains a topic of intense speculation, and Hassett’s statement directly contradicts earlier reports naming him as a leading candidate. This development matters not just for political observers but for anyone watching monetary policy that affects markets worldwide. What Exactly Did Kevin Hassett Say About the Federal Reserve Chair Position? According to reports from Walter Bloomberg, White House National Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett stated clearly that he has not discussed the selection of the next Federal Reserve Chair with President Donald Trump. This statement comes as particularly significant because it follows a previous Bloomberg report that identified Hassett as a frontrunner for the position. The contradiction between the report and Hassett’s denial creates immediate questions about the selection process. Understanding this situation requires looking at the context. The current Federal Reserve Chair, Jerome Powell, faces an uncertain future as his term approaches its conclusion. Therefore, speculation about potential replacements has become a regular feature of financial news. However, Hassett’s denial throws cold water on what many considered a logical progression given his economic background and White House position. Why Does the Federal Reserve Chair Appointment Matter So Much? The Federal Reserve Chair isn’t just another government appointment—it’s arguably the most influential economic position in the world. This person controls monetary policy that affects: Interest rates for mortgages, car loans, and credit cards Inflation levels that impact everyday purchasing power Employment numbers through economic stimulus or restraint Global financial stability through international policy coordination When rumors surface about potential candidates, markets react immediately. Investors try to predict whether a new Federal Reserve Chair would be more hawkish (favoring higher interest rates to control inflation) or dovish (keeping rates low to stimulate growth). Hassett’s economic views are well-documented, which explains why his name surfaced despite his recent denial. What Challenges Does This Situation Reveal? The conflicting reports about the Federal Reserve Chair selection process highlight several important challenges in presidential appointments. First, transparency becomes difficult when multiple sources provide contradictory information. Second, potential candidates often face scrutiny that affects their current roles—Hassett must now navigate questions about his future while maintaining focus on his present responsibilities. Moreover, this situation demonstrates how political considerations intersect with technical expertise. The Federal Reserve Chair should ideally be selected based on economic qualifications, but political alignment inevitably plays a role. Hassett’s denial doesn’t necessarily mean he won’t be considered later, but it does suggest the process remains fluid and uncertain. What Actionable Insights Can We Draw From This Development? For observers trying to understand this situation, several insights emerge. First, never take initial reports as definitive—official denials can change the narrative completely. Second, watch for patterns in how the administration handles high-profile appointments. The Federal Reserve Chair selection will likely follow similar communication patterns as other major appointments. Third, consider the timing of such announcements. Hassett’s denial came relatively quickly after the initial report, suggesting either: The report was inaccurate from the start Circumstances changed rapidly Strategic communication dictated a different public message Finally, remember that the ultimate decision rests with President Trump, who has shown willingness to surprise observers with unexpected appointments. The Federal Reserve Chair selection will ultimately reflect his assessment of both economic needs and political considerations. Conclusion: A Crucial Position Remains Uncertain The denial from Kevin Hassett about discussing the Federal Reserve Chair role with President Trump adds another layer of intrigue to an already complex selection process. While his statement seems definitive, the world of political appointments often contains more nuance than public statements reveal. What remains clear is that whoever eventually fills this position will shape economic policy for years to come, affecting everything from mortgage rates to job growth. As we await further developments, remember that such high-stakes appointments involve multiple considerations beyond what appears in initial reports. The Federal Reserve Chair must balance technical expertise with political reality, making this one of Washington’s most watched decisions. Frequently Asked Questions Who is Kevin Hassett? Kevin Hassett serves as the Director of the White House National Economic Council. He’s a respected economist who previously chaired the Council of Economic Advisers under President Trump. Why was Hassett considered for Federal Reserve Chair? Hassett possesses strong economic credentials and has the president’s trust from working closely with him on economic policy. His background made him a logical candidate despite his recent denial of discussions. What happens if Jerome Powell isn’t reappointed? If the current Federal Reserve Chair isn’t reappointed, the president must nominate a replacement who then requires Senate confirmation. This process typically takes several months. How does the Federal Reserve Chair affect ordinary people? The Federal Reserve Chair influences interest rates on loans, credit card APRs, mortgage rates, and overall economic growth—all of which directly impact household finances. When will we know who the next Federal Reserve Chair will be? While no official timeline exists, most experts expect an announcement before the current term ends to ensure a smooth transition. Can Hassett still become Federal Reserve Chair despite his denial? Yes, political appointments often involve changing circumstances. A denial today doesn’t necessarily preclude consideration tomorrow, though it makes the possibility less likely. Found this analysis helpful?

55391805,https://nulltx.com/?p=152799,1764942052,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/nulltx.png,"Ethereum Activates Fusaka Upgrade, Unlocking Real Sharding for the First Time",https://nulltx.com/ethereum-activates-fusaka-upgrade-unlocking-real-sharding-for-the-first-time/,"Ethereum has shipped its most ambitious scaling milestone in years, the Fusaka upgrade, the network’s second major update of 2025, is now live on mainnet. It activated at epoch 411392 on December 3, 2025, at roughly 21:49 UTC, marking a breakthrough moment that researchers have pursued for nearly a decade. Fusaka introduces PeerDAS, a data availability sampling system that dramatically boosts throughput while lowering costs for rollups. For the first time, Ethereum validators can verify only tiny segments of data instead of full blob payloads. It’s a shift that many core contributors have called the network’s first real step into full sharding. Fusaka is live on Ethereum mainnet! – PeerDAS now unlocks 8x data throughput for rollups – UX improvements via the R1 curve & pre-confirmatons – Prep for scaling the L1 with gas limit increase & more Community members will continue to monitor for issues over the next 24 hrs. — Ethereum (@ethereum) December 3, 2025 PeerDAS Arrives: Ethereum’s Long-Awaited Sharding Vision Begins PeerDAS sits at the center of the Fusaka upgrade. The system lets validators check small samples of data rather than downloading entire blobs. This change increases blob capacity for rollups by roughly 8×, according to the upgrade specification. The impact is simple: Ethereum can now safely handle far more L2 activity, with lower fees and stronger guarantees. Instead of relying on full-node data downloads or validator voting, PeerDAS uses client-side probabilistic verification. Validators only need to see a fraction of the data to agree on its availability. And this approach remains robust even in the face of 51% attacks. In a post celebrating the launch, Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin emphasized how meaningful this moment is. “Sharding has been a dream for Ethereum since 2015,” he wrote. Data availability sampling has been discussed since 2017. Now, after years of research and engineering, the system is real, live on the largest smart-contract network in the world. PeerDAS in Fusaka is significant because it literally is sharding. Ethereum is coming to consensus on blocks without requiring any single node to see more than a tiny fraction of the data. And this is robust to 51% attacks – it's client-side probabilistic verification, not… pic.twitter.com/OK81xBteER — vitalik.eth (@VitalikButerin) December 3, 2025 Why PeerDAS Matters Ethereum’s core bottleneck has always been data throughput. Rollups depend on blob space to post transaction data, and blob supply determines both scalability and user fees. PeerDAS solves this bottleneck by making blob verification cheaper and more parallelized across the network. The effect is immediate: Rollups can push far more data per block. Users see lower fees as rollup costs drop. The network becomes more resilient under load. PeerDAS marks the largest improvement to rollup bandwidth since EIP-4844 launched in 2024. But experts note that this is also a foundational shift. Ethereum is no longer designed around monolithic validation. It now reliably reaches consensus without requiring any single node to view all the data. This is the core design principle behind modular blockchains, and Ethereum has now taken its biggest step yet toward that future. Three Ways Fusaka’s Sharding Is Still Incomplete Despite the massive leap forward, researchers stress that Fusaka delivers the first stage of Ethereum’s sharding roadmap, not the final form. Vitalik Buterin outlined three gaps that still remain: 1. L1 Still Lacks Full Throughput Benefits PeerDAS enables L2s to process O(c²) transactions, where c is per-node compute. But Ethereum’s Layer 1 cannot enjoy the same scaling until ZK-EVMs mature. These proving systems are required for the base chain to scale internally rather than relying only on rollups. 2. The Proposer-Builder Bottleneck Today, block builders must still process all data to build full blocks. This creates a centralization pressure point. A future version of sharding requires distributed block building, where multiple parties collaborate to assemble blocks without any single participant holding all the data. 3. No Sharded Mempool Yet Ethereum still uses a global mempool. A truly sharded system requires a sharded mempool, allowing different parts of the network to handle transactions independently. This is a key missing piece for full horizontal scalability. Even with these limitations, Fusaka stands as the most important architectural update to Ethereum since The Merge. What Fusaka Includes: A Full Breakdown of New EIPs The upgrade bundles multiple improvements beyond PeerDAS. Each pushes Ethereum toward more performance, better user experience, and smoother execution. • EIP-7594: PeerDAS Enables data availability sampling and significantly expands blob throughput, roughly 8× more capacity for rollups. • EIP-7935: Higher Block Gas Limit Raises the default block gas limit to 60 million, giving L1 more breathing room for computation-intensive transactions. • EIP-7951: secp256r1 (R1 Curve) Precompile Adds native support for the R1 signature curve. This enables faster, cheaper, and more seamless wallet experiences, especially for mobile and Web2-compatible cryptography. • EIP-7917: Proposer Lookahead Introduces lookahead windows for block proposers, unlocking pre-confirmations and reducing latency for users. • EIP-7892: BPO Framework Creates a structured system for progressively increasing blob targets, allowing the network to scale carefully without risking stability. • Additional upgrades Includes ModExp enhancements, the CLZ opcode, networking improvements, and other refinements across the execution and consensus layers. The combination of these upgrades showcases Ethereum’s continued focus on efficiency, usability, and long-term decentralization. Fusaka is now live on @ethereum mainnet Activated at epoch 411392 (Dec 3, 2025 ~21:49 UTC) What’s inside the upgrade: • EIP-7594: PeerDAS (~8× more blob throughput for rollups) • EIP-7935: Default block gas limit raised to 60M • EIP-7951: secp256r1 (R1 curve) precompile for… pic.twitter.com/aizIFvym7H — Crypto Miners (@CryptoMiners_Co) December 4, 2025 Network Stability and What Comes Next Following activation, the Ethereum network shows high validator participation and stable performance. No major incidents have been reported. Client teams continue to monitor PeerDAS behavior, as scaling changes of this magnitude require careful observation in real environments. The next step arrives soon: BPO1 on December 9, which increases the blob target/max to 10/15. This will expand throughput even further and test the stability boundaries introduced in Fusaka. Researchers expect the next two years to focus on: Refining PeerDAS Gradually raising blob capacity Scaling L2 ecosystems Advancing ZK-EVM performance Paving the way for L1 scalability through full sharding Fusaka sets the stage. The roadmap ahead brings Ethereum deeper into its modular era. A Milestone Years in the Making Fusaka is more than an upgrade. It is a landmark achievement shaped by thousands of researchers, client developers, security teams, and community contributors. After years of exploration, simulation, and design, Ethereum finally has a functional implementation of data availability sampling on mainnet. It redefines what the network can do today, and what will be possible tomorrow. The era of real sharding has begun. Disclosure: This is not trading or investment advice.

Namely, the token is trading below all major short- and mid-term moving averages, while the relative strength index ( RSI ) sits at 44, signaling fading momentum. In short, retail panic appears to contrast sharply with institutional accumulation. Historically, however, such setups have preceded rallies of up to 20%, meaning that short-term price swings could mark the next few days.

The new program unveiled this week is curated for Kraken’s ultra-high net worth individuals, active traders and institutional capital allocators who want bespoke support and direct access to senior experts inside the firm. Large centralized exchanges have been racing to attract private clients and family offices with the “premium treatment” once reserved for traditional wealth managers. Rival exchange Binance also recently created its own “prestige” tier for users with a net worth of at least $10 million. Kraken builds VIP program with ‘high touch services’ According to a blog post published by Kraken on Thursday, the VIP tier features support and “extraordinary experiences,” where a member is matched with a specialist relationship manager as their primary point of contact. The managers are backed by 24/7 support teams and multichannel access to staff within Kraken’s product groups. VIPs also receive early visibility into new features on its product ecosystem, access that extends to in-house specialists in liquidity, custody, engineering and infrastructure. In a statement announcing the program, Co-CEO Arjun Sethi said Kraken made the tier to meet the expectations of clients with financial scale. Membership in the tier requires either a $10 million average balance on the platform or annual trading volume of $80 million. “Ultra high-net-worth clients don’t come to us for speed alone; they also come to us because they expect a partner who matches their ambition and understands what true scale looks like. Kraken VIP was built for them. It has unprecedented access, influence, and an improved experience that doesn’t exist anywhere else in the digital asset ecosystem,” he told reporters in the briefing. VIP members will be invited to “extraordinary experiences,” including Formula 1 events, football matches, cultural gatherings and small meet-ups not open to the public. The company reiterated that the engagements will help deepen relationships between clients and senior figures in the industry. Kraken expands services into tokenized assets The VIP program launch is on the backdrop of another major announcement from the San Francisco-based exchange made this week. Cryptopolitan had reported on Tuesday that Kraken is acquiring Backed Finance, a tokenization platform that issues digital representations of real-world assets, including stocks and exchange-traded fund shares. Kraken has already listed several tokens created by Backed, and according to executives from both sides, the acquisition enables the exchange to integrate those products more tightly into its system. Sethi, who discussed the deal in a recent interview, said Kraken intends to treat tokenized equities better than the short-lived trend synonymous with crypto assets. “While everyone is talking about tokenized equities, we are just doing it,” he said. “We are focused on long-term investment, not hype.” Public listing in sight, but CEO Sethi says ‘no hurry’ Kraken has been preparing for an initial public offering after quietly filing for an IPO with the SEC and closing a funding round, taking its valuation to $20 billion. The exchange, formally known as Payward Ventures, is one of the industry’s oldest operators, having debuted in 2011. It has been operating on a lean capital structure, taking in just $27 million in external primary funding from its inception through the end of last year. However, that approach was flipped earlier this year when Kraken raised $500 million from investors Apollo Global Management, Oppenheimer and Jane Street. Financial news publication Fortune reported that the round valued the firm at $15 billion before subsequent developments pushed its valuation higher. Speaking at Yahoo Finance’s Invest event in mid-November, Sethi insisted Kraken is not in a rush to go public, even though competitor Coinbase is now publicly traded. “We have enough capital on our balance sheet today as a private company, and we don’t want to race to the door as quickly as possible. What’s good about these companies coming out first is that they are educating the market on what’s good and what’s bad, what margin looks like, how do you make money,” he asserted.

The breach exposed a little-known risk within Solana’s account structure and showed how attackers can alter wallet permissions without showing any visible change during signing. How Attackers Exploit Solana’s Permission Framework SlowMist reported that the attacker gained control of the wallet by modifying its Owner permission through a deceptive signature request. The transaction showed no balance movement, which lowered suspicion. Moreover, many Solana users assume their account ownership works like Ethereum’s EOAs. Hence, they do not expect ownership to change with a single signature. This misunderstanding creates room for attackers who design transactions that appear harmless while delivering high-risk operations. Additionally, experts note that Solana uses several account types, including normal accounts and PDAs. Token accounts operate under rules enforced by their token program. These structures improve efficiency but introduce more areas for attackers to target. Significantly, the recent case involved several layers of permission manipulation, which allowed the attacker to route funds through multiple platforms and addresses. Complex Laundering Routes Show Evolving Phishing Methods Investigators at MistTrack traced the attacker’s movements and found rapid, multi-platform fund rotations. The route included cross-chain cycles, CEX deposits, and the reuse of DeFi assets. Moreover, two major wallet hubs handled most of the transfers, showing a pattern seen in other advanced laundering schemes. The victim also had another $2 million locked in DeFi platforms. Relevant protocol teams helped recover those assets, showing the value of quick reporting. How Solana Users Can Reduce Risk Security firms emphasize caution. Users should verify URLs, confirm transaction details, and avoid interacting with unknown links. Additionally, they should maintain separate wallets for high-risk activities and store valuable assets offline. Moreover, they should avoid unlimited approvals and review every permission request carefully.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|ETH|SOL|CRYPTOCURRENCY|SECURITY INCIDENTS,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-12-05 13:54:44
55391960,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=232273,1764942911,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Revealed: National Bank of Canada’s Massive $273 Million Bitcoin Bet Through MicroStrategy,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/national-bank-canada-bitcoin-investment/,"BitcoinWorld Revealed: National Bank of Canada’s Massive $273 Million Bitcoin Bet Through MicroStrategy In a move that signals deepening institutional confidence, the National Bank of Canada has made a substantial Bitcoin investment by acquiring a massive stake in MicroStrategy. This strategic holding, worth over a quarter of a billion dollars, places a major Canadian financial institution directly into the cryptocurrency arena. Let’s unpack what this means for the future of finance. What Does the National Bank of Canada’s Bitcoin Investment Entail? According to data from BitcoinTreasuries.NET, the National Bank of Canada—the country’s sixth-largest bank—holds 1.47 million shares of MicroStrategy (MSTR). This position is currently valued at approximately $273 million. Therefore, this is not a minor experiment; it’s a significant financial commitment. By investing in MicroStrategy, the bank gains indirect exposure to Bitcoin, as the business intelligence company’s primary strategy is to acquire and hold the cryptocurrency. Why Is This Institutional Move So Significant? This National Bank of Canada Bitcoin investment matters for several key reasons. It represents a major shift in how traditional banks view digital assets. Validation: A leading bank’s substantial stake acts as a powerful endorsement of Bitcoin as a legitimate asset class. Strategic Pathway: Investing via a listed company like MicroStrategy offers a regulated, familiar avenue for institutional exposure without directly holding the asset on their balance sheet. Market Confidence: This move signals to other institutional players that sophisticated financial strategies involving cryptocurrency are becoming mainstream. Moreover, this decision reflects a growing trend where traditional finance seeks to capture the potential upside of the digital asset revolution. How Does This Fit Into Broader Banking Trends? The National Bank of Canada is not acting in isolation. Other global financial institutions are exploring similar avenues. However, a direct equity investment of this scale by a major retail and commercial bank is a notable development. It suggests that bank strategists see long-term value in the convergence of blockchain technology and traditional finance. This Bitcoin investment can be seen as a hedge against currency devaluation and a bet on technological innovation. What Are the Potential Challenges and Considerations? While promising, this strategy is not without its hurdles. The bank’s investment is tied to MicroStrategy’s stock performance, which is highly correlated with Bitcoin’s price volatility. Furthermore, regulatory landscapes for cryptocurrencies are still evolving in Canada and globally. The bank must navigate these uncertainties while managing its fiduciary duty to shareholders. Despite these challenges, the sheer size of the position indicates a calculated acceptance of this risk for potential reward. What Can Investors Learn From This Move? The National Bank of Canada’s action provides a clear, actionable insight: major institutions are building positions for the long term. For individual investors, this underscores the importance of understanding the proxy methods, like stock holdings, through which large entities gain crypto exposure. It also highlights MicroStrategy’s unique role as a publicly-traded gateway to Bitcoin. Observing how traditional banks like the National Bank of Canada manage this Bitcoin investment over time will offer valuable lessons in portfolio strategy. Conclusion: A Watershed Moment for Crypto Adoption The National Bank of Canada’s $273 million position is more than a line item on a balance sheet. It is a bold declaration that digital assets have secured a permanent place in the future of institutional portfolios. This move blurs the line between traditional finance and the crypto economy, paving the way for further integration. As one of Canada’s largest banks takes this step, it invites others to follow, potentially accelerating widespread adoption. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q: Did the National Bank of Canada buy Bitcoin directly? A: No. The bank purchased shares of MicroStrategy (MSTR), a company that holds a large amount of Bitcoin on its balance sheet. This gives the bank indirect exposure to Bitcoin’s price movements. Q: Why would a bank invest in MicroStrategy instead of buying Bitcoin itself? A: Investing in a listed company is a familiar, regulated process for institutions. It avoids the complexities of direct crypto custody, security, and accounting that might still be challenging for traditional banks. Q: Is this the largest investment of its kind by a Canadian bank? A> While specific rankings may change, a $273 million investment from a major bank like the National Bank of Canada is certainly one of the most significant public disclosures of its kind in the Canadian financial sector. Q: What does this mean for everyday customers of the bank? A> In the short term, it likely means very little for daily banking services. However, it signals the bank’s strategic direction and could eventually lead to more crypto-related products and services being offered to customers. Q: How can I track this kind of institutional investment data? A> Websites like BitcoinTreasuries.NET aggregate public data on corporate and institutional Bitcoin holdings, including investments through vehicles like MicroStrategy. Q: Does this make MicroStrategy stock a safer way to invest in Bitcoin? A> Not necessarily “safer.” While it is a regulated stock, MSTR shares can be more volatile than Bitcoin itself, as they are influenced by both company performance and Bitcoin’s price. It is a different type of risk. Share This Insight Did this analysis of the National Bank of Canada’s major crypto move surprise you? This kind of institutional adoption is reshaping finance.

The launch adds a new layer of financial functionality to the Flare ecosystem by allowing the separation of fixed and variable yield components. How Spectra works At the core of Spectra’s design is a system that splits yield-bearing tokens into two tradable components. Principal Tokens (PTs) represent the base value of the asset and grow to their full value at maturity, giving users access to fixed returns. Yield Tokens (YTs) represent the rights to future yield and can be traded independently, allowing users to hedge or speculate on yield fluctuations. By making yield itself tradable, Spectra introduces a new type of financial instrument to decentralized finance ( DeFi ) on Flare. Users may earn a predictable income through PTs or gain leveraged exposure to yield through YTs. Both tokens can also serve as building blocks for other protocols within the ecosystem, such as modular lending platforms like Mystic or Morpho. How Flare benefits The introduction of yield tokenization on Flare marks an important step in expanding the network’s financial infrastructure. With Spectra, developers can build fixed-rate, variable-rate, and structured products natively on Flare. The protocol also enhances capital efficiency by allowing yield-based assets to move across multiple platforms and be reused within lending or collateral systems. Spectra’s permissionless structure allows anyone to create yield-trading markets for assets such as sFLR or FAssets, earning fees from swaps in a model similar to Uniswap. While the platform is designed for advanced users and institutions seeking greater control over returns, its tools are also accessible to newcomers through a simplified “Fixed Rate” interface that allows users to lock in known returns, such as paying 1 today to receive around 1.1 at maturity. Who is it for? Spectra is designed as a permissionless yield-derivatives protocol, open to anyone looking to trade, manage, or launch markets for yield-bearing assets on Flare. Users can create their own yield-trading markets for tokens such as sFLR or FAssets and earn fees on swaps in a model similar to Uniswap. At launch, Spectra features a liquidity pool for Flare’s native liquid staking token, sFLR, which supports the protocol’s two core markets: fixed-rate trading via Principal Tokens (PTs) and yield-leverage trading via Yield Tokens (YTs). Liquidity providers maintain balanced exposure to both sides of the market, earning swap fees and potentially receiving additional incentives such as rFLR or SPECTRA tokens. In its early phase, the project’s main focus is on deepening liquidity to improve efficiency and reduce trading costs across pools. For newcomers and the wider Flare community, Spectra offers a simple entry point through its Fixed Rate tool, allowing users to lock in predictable income. For example, paying 1 today to receive around 1.1 at maturity. As users gain experience, they can explore more complex strategies, such as yield speculation or providing liquidity to support market depth. The next stage of expansion will introduce Firelight’s stXRP, extending Spectra’s yield-trading functionality to new assets and further broadening opportunities for users and developers.

The recovery has sparked debate among analysts: some view the bounce as nothing more than a relief rally within a broader bearish trend, while others believe Ethereum may be building the foundation for a more sustained rebound. Related Reading: XRP On-Chain Velocity Hits Yearly High As Network Activity Explodes A new CryptoQuant report offers one of the clearest insights. According to Ethereum data on Binance, the past several weeks have shown heightened volatility in the Cumulative Volume Delta (CVD) — a metric that tracks real-time buying and selling pressure. This volatility reflects sharp, rapid shifts in trader behavior as the market attempts to stabilize. Although Ethereum remains in a downtrend from its August peak, recent CVD spikes point to the return of notable buying activity. However, the report emphasizes that these bursts of demand are sporadic and lack the sustained strength needed to confirm a full bullish reversal. CVD Volatility Highlights Ongoing Battle Between Buyers and Sellers According to the Arab Chain report, Ethereum’s CVD recently turned positive, coinciding with the price’s attempt to stabilize above the $3,100 level. This shift indicates fresh liquidity entering the market through short-term buy orders, suggesting that some traders are stepping in to accumulate during dips. However, the sudden spikes and rapid pullbacks within the CVD reveal that the market remains locked in a strong tug-of-war between buyers and sellers. This volatility underscores the fact that Ethereum has not yet reached either temporal stability or a clear structural trend. The report also highlights the importance of the 30-day correlation between price and CVD, which has held steady at around 0.6 despite lower price levels. This relatively high reading shows that liquidity flows continue to influence Ethereum’s price direction in a meaningful and consistent way. Even though buying pressure appears irregular, its recurring impact on price suggests that traders are still actively responding to market conditions. Overall, this pattern reflects investors attempting to capitalize on volatility, especially as anticipation grows around potential liquidity inflows tied to upcoming network upgrades. Yet, Arab Chain stresses that without a more sustained accumulation phase and reduced short-term selling, Ethereum may struggle to generate a decisive upward movement. Related Reading: Ethereum NUPL Holds Steady, Signaling Market Balance Amid Volatility Ethereum Attempts a Recovery but Faces Key Resistance Ethereum’s latest price action shows a cautious recovery as ETH climbs back above the $3,150 level, but the chart reveals that the broader structure remains fragile. After a steep decline from the October highs near $4,500, ETH found support slightly above $2,700, where buyers stepped back in with increased volume—visible in the recent surge of green candles at the bottom of the chart. This reaction suggests renewed interest at lower levels, but not yet a decisive shift in trend. The price is now pressing against the 100-day SMA (red line), a level that previously acted as support and has now flipped into resistance. Reclaiming this line would be an important step toward restoring bullish momentum. Above it, ETH faces another barrier at the 50-day SMA (blue line), which continues to slope downward, reflecting ongoing medium-term selling pressure.

But before we head into detail for the December 1 sudden crash, let’s first quickly recap what took place before that. Recall that bitcoin began its substantial correction after the ATH in early October, but the worst occurred in November when the bears had complete control of the market for weeks and drove it to a seven-month low of under $81,000 on November 21. The asset bounced and flirted with $90,000 before it finally reclaimed that level at the end of the month. However, as mentioned above, December 1 brought another immediate and violent nosedive, in which BTC’s price tumbled in a matter of hours from around $91,000 to under $84,000. Nevertheless, the bulls were alert this time and didn’t allow another retest of the $80,000 support. In fact, bitcoin rebounded almost as quickly and even surged to $94,000 on a couple of occasions during the business week. The overall market weakness, though, turned out to be too solid at the moment, and BTC was rejected there. It has lost over three grand since then and now sits at around $90,000, which actually means that it’s slightly in the red weekly. The community’s attention has now turned to next week’s FOMC meeting, the last for the year, in which the US Federal Reserve will make its highly anticipated interest rate move. The probability for another 25 bps reduction stands at over 90% at Polymarket, which could be bullish for BTC and riskier assets. Nevertheless, the weekly scale is quite painful for most altcoins. XRP is down by over 6%, HYPE has plunged by 12%, while ZEC has lost its momentum and has dumped by almost 20%. Market Data Cryptocurrency Market Overview Weekly.

The move comes as the crypto market struggles and SHIB trades below key psychological levels. Such accumulation reduces immediate selling pressure and may signal confidence in a potential price rebound. The transaction underscores the ongoing interest in discounted SHIB holdings despite stagnant market conditions. Large-Scale Withdrawal Signals Accumulation Data from Arkham Intelligence shows the whale executed six separate withdrawals from Coinbase between December 3 and December 4, 2025, totaling 169,136,053,041 SHIB. The first transaction transferred 81.61 billion SHIB to the new wallet, followed by three more withdrawals of 19.48 billion, 11.59 billion, and 11.55 billion tokens on the same day. On December 4, two additional transfers added 11.34 billion and 33.54 billion SHIB, completing the total accumulation. Arkham Intelligence confirmed that the wallet had no prior inflows, indicating it was recently created specifically for this purpose. The whale has not moved or sold any of the withdrawn tokens. By keeping all 169.13 billion SHIB in the wallet, the investor reduces the number of tokens available on exchanges. This action effectively lowers immediate selling pressure and signals a strategy focused on long-term accumulation rather than short-term profit-taking. At current SHIB prices, the withdrawn tokens are valued at roughly $1.46 million. Source: Arkham Intelligence Context and Market Implications Although significant, the withdrawal is small compared to previous large-scale movements from Coinbase. In July 2025, a new wallet pulled 5 trillion SHIB from the exchange, followed by another 3 trillion tokens in August. The timing of this latest accumulation is crucial. SHIB has remained near $0.0000086, below the $0.00001 mark that many holders watch as a key resistance level. The subdued price environment has created an attractive entry point for buyers seeking to accumulate SHIB at a discount. At the time of writing, SHIB is trading at $0.058395, representing a 3.99% decline over the past 24 hours. SHIB price chart, Source: CoinMarketCap The market reaction will largely depend on whether the whale continues to buy SHIB on Coinbase. The ongoing accumulation could serve as a bullish signal, encouraging other traders to follow suit. Conversely, if the whale halts activity, the move may be interpreted as a single event with limited market impact. Traders and observers are now monitoring the wallet closely to gauge potential trends in SHIB trading volumes and price movements.",News|Shiba Inu,EN,0,0,EXCHANGE|MARKET|SHIB|TRADING|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-12-05 14:01:36
55392066,641030,1764943308,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/55392066.jpeg,Svolta nel Regno Unito: Nuova Legge Classifica le Criptovalute come “Proprietà Privata”,https://bitcoinist.com/svolta-nel-regno-unito-nuova-legge-classifica-le-criptovalute-come-proprieta-privata/,"Il Regno Unito ha appena messo nero su bianco una nuova legg e che classifica ufficialmente le criptovalute come proprietà ai sensi del diritto inglese. La misura è stata approvata e ha ricevuto l’ Assenso Reale (Royal Assent) il 2 dicembre 2025, diventando effettiva a tutti gli effetti. Questa mossa trasforma un lungo periodo di incertezza legale in una regola chiara su “chi possiede cosa” quando si parla di Bitcoin, stablecoin e altri asset tokenizzati. Nasce una “Terza Categoria” di Proprietà Secondo il report , il disegno di legge — denominato Property (Digital Assets etc.) Act 2025 — crea una nuova, “terza categoria” di beni personali specifica per gli asset digitali. La legge copre le giurisdizioni di Inghilterra, Galles e Irlanda del Nord. È importante fare una distinzione: Cosa NON fa: Non rende le crypto “valuta legale” (non devono essere accettate obbligatoriamente nei negozi) e non stabilisce di per sé nuove regole per gli exchange o le tasse. Cosa FA: Conferisce ai proprietari un titolo giuridico molto più solido da far valere in tribunale. I Tribunali avevano già preparato il terreno Ancor prima della legge , i giudici inglesi stavano già trattando le crypto come proprietà in alcuni casi specifici, basandosi sulla Common Law . 2019: Una sentenza dell’Alta Corte aveva concesso un rimedio proprietario su Bitcoin utilizzati in una richiesta di riscatto. 2023: Un giudice aveva stabilito che la stablecoin USDT poteva attrarre diritti di proprietà. https://twitter.com/CryptoUKAssoc/status/1995872556851527848 Gruppi legali come la UK Jurisdiction Taskforce sostenevano da anni che le crypto soddisfacevano i test base per essere definite proprietà: possono essere definite, trovate, trasferite e detenute per un periodo di tempo. La nuova legge inserisce semplicemente questa visione nello statuto ufficiale. SCOPRI: Migliori Wallet Crypto Diritti più forti per i Detentori (e per i Creditori) Con lo status di proprietà scritto nella legge, le persone che detengono crypto troveranno più facile avviare cause per recuperare asset rubati o persi. Ma c’è l’altro lato della medaglia: creditori e curatori fallimentari avranno basi più chiare per includere gli asset digitali nelle eredità e nelle procedure di bancarotta. I report suggeriscono che il cambiamento renderà più facile ottenere tramite i tribunali britannici: Ordini di congelamento (Freezing orders). Sequestri. Restituzioni. Questo è fondamentale per le vittime di hack, i clienti di piattaforme fallite e chiunque stia cercando di dividere un patrimonio (es. in caso di divorzio) che include criptovalute. Una Fondazione Legale, non un Regolamento completo L’atto è un riconoscimento legale, non un manuale operativo completo su come le crypto vengono comprate, vendute o tassate. I regolatori controllano ancora le licenze, i controlli antiriciclaggio e la condotta di mercato. Le autorità fiscali continueranno a definire come vengono valutati i guadagni. Secondo i commentatori legali, questa legge agisce come una fondazione : chiarisce prima di tutto la proprietà, permettendo a legislatori e regolatori di costruire regole più dettagliate su questa base solida in futuro.

Here’s Why,https://timestabloid.com/analyst-to-xrp-investors-big-reversal-is-coming-heres-why/,"A powerful shift is building around XRP, and the charts are starting to reflect it. Market sentiment has moved quickly from caution to renewed interest as traders search for the next major trend. Recent price action has drawn widespread attention because it hints at a potential turning point that could reshape XRP’s trajectory in the coming weeks. The analysis gaining traction comes from STEPH IS CRYPTO, who shared a compelling technical setup on X. His chart highlighted a clean bullish divergence that mirrors patterns seen before major XRP recoveries. From this point onward, he will be referred to as Steph. The clarity of his analysis sparked immediate discussion among traders who felt the market had overlooked a significant signal. $XRP BIG REVERSAL INCOMING!!! pic.twitter.com/0lw8TeqPcc — STEPH IS CRYPTO (@Steph_iscrypto) December 4, 2025 Technical Signal Suggests Momentum Shift Steph’s chart shows a clear divergence between price and the RSI indicator. Price formed a lower low while RSI printed a higher low. This divergence signals weakening selling pressure and strengthening market momentum. XRP has followed similar patterns before strong upward reversals, making the current setup difficult to ignore. The structure resembles previous historical turning points, which adds weight to the signal. Key Support Zone Strengthens the Case The bullish case gains credibility because the price touched a major demand area between $2.10 and $1.85 . This zone contains deep liquidity and strong historical support. Buyers have stepped into this region several times, which explains the recent stall in downward movement. If this zone continues to hold, it becomes the launchpad for a sustained reversal. The market’s reaction here suggests the zone still carries influence. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Market Conditions Align With the Reversal Setup The technical signal does not stand alone. Market conditions now support a possible trend shift. Intraday volume has increased, and ETF-related flows remain active. These inflows show growing institutional interest in XRP. Broader crypto conditions also create space for a sharp upside move if confidence strengthens. Liquidity indicators point to rising participation, which often fuels early recovery phases. What Traders Should Monitor A confirmed reversal requires more than a divergence signal. Traders will look for a daily close above short-term resistance levels with rising volume. Momentum should continue climbing to validate the breakout attempt. If XRP loses the $2.10–$1.85 support region, the reversal narrative weakens. Traders must manage risk because divergences can fail when market volatility expands. In conclusion, Steph’s analysis has sharpened market focus on a pattern with real historical weight. The combination of bullish divergence, strong support, and growing institutional participation creates a credible reversal setup. XRP is positioned for a potential shift in trend, and the coming days may determine whether this signal evolves into a full breakout. Traders watching for confirmation could gain the most if momentum continues to build. Disclaimer : This content is meant to inform and should not be considered financial advice.

A recent and significant transfer of BTC by Strategy to Fidelity Custody has analysts sounding the alarm. This move follows a company statement about potentially selling Bitcoin, mirroring actions from other corporate giants like SpaceX. Let’s unpack what this could mean for the market and for you. What Does Strategy’s Bitcoin Transfer Really Mean? Strategy, a notable corporate Bitcoin holder, recently moved its BTC to Fidelity Custody. According to Jacob King, CEO of crypto media outlet SwanDesk, this is a critical development. It comes shortly after Strategy hinted it might sell its Bitcoin if a key metric—its market cap to net asset value (mNAV)—stays below one. In simple terms, they suggested selling if the market price doesn’t reflect the underlying value they see. King draws a direct parallel to SpaceX, which also transferred BTC to Coinbase. He notes that moving coins to a major exchange like Coinbase is typically a step taken to prepare for a Bitcoin sale , not to make a purchase. Therefore, this pattern of behavior is a strong market signal. Are Institutions Preparing for a Major Bitcoin Sale? The evidence suggests a coordinated shift. King points to on-chain data indicating that many publicly traded companies with Bitcoin exposure have already sold portions of their holdings. Crucially, these sales often occurred when Bitcoin’s price was above $90,000. This activity points to a strategic exit by large players. The core concern King raises is stark: institutions appear to be seeking an exit before a potential full bear market begins. This could leave retail investors—the everyday people—holding the assets during a downturn. Pattern Recognition: Transfers to custodians like Fidelity or exchanges like Coinbase often precede sales. Timing is Key: Sales by other firms happened near peak prices, suggesting profit-taking. Market Impact: Large-scale institutional selling can increase market supply and apply downward pressure on price. Why Should Retail Investors Pay Attention? For individual investors, these moves are a vital lesson in market dynamics. Institutions often have better data, research teams, and different risk tolerances. When they act in unison, it’s wise to understand their rationale. This doesn’t necessarily mean you should panic sell. However, it underscores the importance of having a clear strategy. Are you investing for the long term, or trading short-term volatility? Understanding institutional behavior helps you contextualize market movements and avoid being caught off guard by a potential large-scale Bitcoin sale . Actionable Insights for the Current Climate So, what can you do with this information? First, stay informed. Follow credible on-chain analysts and news sources. Second, review your own portfolio’s risk. If a significant market correction occurred, would your investment plan hold? Finally, remember that cryptocurrency markets are cyclical. While a wave of institutional selling can lead to a downturn, it also creates opportunities. The key is to be prepared, not reactive. Conclusion: Navigating the Institutional Shift The transfer by Strategy is more than a simple transaction; it’s a potential bellwether for institutional sentiment. As analysts like Jacob King warn, the signs point toward large players securing exits. For the broader market, this highlights the growing maturity—and complexity—of Bitcoin as an asset class. The era of “HODL” is being tested by sophisticated corporate treasury strategies. Your best defense is knowledge, a clear plan, and an understanding that institutional moves like a potential Bitcoin sale are part of the market’s evolution. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What is an mNAV ratio, and why does it matter for Strategy? A1: mNAV stands for Market Cap to Net Asset Value. It’s a metric used by some funds to compare their total market value to the value of their underlying assets. If Strategy’s Bitcoin holdings are worth less on the market than on their books (mNAV Q2: Does moving Bitcoin to Fidelity always mean a sale? A2: Not always. Fidelity is a custody service for secure storage. However, when this move follows a public statement about selling conditions and mirrors similar moves by other firms to exchanges, it strongly suggests sale preparation. Q3: How can retail investors track institutional Bitcoin movements? A3: You can use on-chain analytics platforms that track whale wallets (large holders) and exchange flows. These tools show when large amounts of BTC are moved to known exchange wallets, which can indicate selling pressure. Q4: Should I sell my Bitcoin because institutions might? A4: Not necessarily. Your investment decision should align with your personal financial goals, risk tolerance, and time horizon. Institutional moves are one data point to consider within your broader strategy. Q5: What other companies have sold Bitcoin recently? A5: While not all details are public, on-chain analysts have noted selling activity from several publicly traded companies that bought Bitcoin in 2020 and 2021, often taking profits as prices rose. Q6: Could this institutional selling cause a long-term bear market? A6: It could contribute to a downturn, but many factors drive long-term market cycles, including macroeconomic conditions, adoption rates, and regulatory developments. Institutional selling is a significant short-term pressure. Found this analysis crucial for understanding market risks?
