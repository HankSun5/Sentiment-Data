And this is exactly why Mutuum Finance (MUTM) , going for just $0.035, is racing towards becoming the next crypto to explode, especially as comparisons grow increasingly unavoidable as they are drawn against Shiba Inu (SHIB). Unlike mainstream DeFi, Mutuum is pioneering a truly new DeFi credit economy platform that supports under-collateralized loan services, something that mainstream DeFi has never quite managed successfully before. It is being recognized as the top crypto for investors looking for utility and early-stage growth. Shiba Inu Experiencing Deep Correction as Support Lines are Tested Shiba Inu (SHIB), despite being under heavy bear market pressures, has seen its price plummet down due to its recent breakdown, descending down towards a 23-month low of about $0.00000837, as was seen through most of 2024. Although having increasingly growing burn rates, decreasing exchange balances, and, quite amazingly, its own SHIB Spot ETF filing by asset manager T. Rowe Price, managing funds of $1.7 trillion, Shiba Inu has yet to spark a potential buy signal and reverse its market trend positively once again. Presently, holders of Shiba Inu, who had purchased it at its opening value this year, have decreased by 57% since Shiba Inu has managed to breach more than a few technical support levels, including its moving averages of 20, 50, and 200 days. Support can be expected around price levels of $0.000006, while its relief rally would have to reclaim price points above $0.00001150 through $0.00001220 if it is going to turn its trend positively again. Because of its currently weakening market structure, some investors have turned their focus on Mutuum Finance (MUTM) as the next crypto to explode. Mutuum Finance Drives the Next DeFi Innovation Wave Mutuum Finance is quickly appearing as one of the most visionary forces on the horizon of the market of decentralized finance. Its presale is still ongoing and has been beating all estimates, having attracted over 17,810 participants and raising more than $18.5 million. All this indicates that Mutuum Finance is the top crypto on offer on today’s market. Smart, Transparent, and Open Lending on Web3 Also at the core of this platform is a new loan and borrow system that has been designed as a means of addressing many of the issues identified as problematic through previous DeFi platforms that have been used as a model for Mutuum Finance’s design and functionality. Mutuum Finance enables borrowers and lenders to agree on repayment terms, as well as enables borrowers to have flexible loan rates that vary based on market conditions. Establishing a New Benchmark for Future DeFi Platforms Through its focus on openness, user empowerment, and economic design, Mutuum Finance is setting up a solid platform for what is expected of DeFi in the coming years. Mutuum Finance is bringing back trust and functionality into DeFi and providing a platform for value creation through actual usage as opposed to hype. With time, Mutuum Finance is emerging not only as an investment token, but as a system that is expected to cultivate participation and sustainability through financial growth that is community-oriented. Mutuum Finance has currently managed to onboard over 17,810 investors and has garnered over $18.5 million, with Phase 6 of its presale more than 85% sold out at a price of $0.035. Mutuum is filling a market need that many other altcoins, such as Shiba Inu, have been unable to address through its utility-focused DeFi platform and its provision of under-collateralized loan services and transparent loan conditions that many DeFi platforms lack today due to scalability issues and technology constraints. Investors looking for the next crypto to explode have a great entry point before Phase 7’s price increases to $0.04, positioning Mutuum Finance as the top crypto for the coming market cycle. Take immediate action through the official presale of Mutuum Finance to buy tokens at entry price and prepare for potential high growth returns, making it the next crypto to explode.

54213555,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=856631,1762725600,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/54213555.jpeg,How RentStac (RNS) Is Transforming DeFi and Creating New Millionaires,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/how-rentstac-rns-is-transforming-defi-and-creating-new-millionaires/,"The DeFi market is rapidly evolving as investors search for projects that connect blockchain with tangible assets, as RentStac (RNS) does.This crypto has entered the spotlight by merging decentralized finance with real estate income, offering a structured and transparent way for users to participate in property-backed yield through the blockchain. According to verified data, the token sale price begins at $0.025 per RNS , progressing through seven presale stages. The total supply is fixed at 2 billion tokens , with 40 percent (800 million) allocated to the presale. The full target across all stages is approximately $27.45 million , as stated in the project’s official documentation. Real Utility Behind the Trend While many DeFi projects rely purely on speculation, this crypto is building on the real economy. It tokenizes rental properties through legally registered structures known as SPVs, converting real rental income into blockchain-based rewards. This connection between traditional finance and DeFi is driving attention from analysts focused on long-term sustainability. The platform distributes yield in stablecoins, introduces a buyback-and-burn model to reduce circulating supply, and integrates DAO-based governance. All these mechanisms are designed to ensure that token value reflects real usage and revenue, not short-term market hype. Security and Transparency Security and transparency are central to this project’s development. The official site reports a Solidity Scan score of 92.48 percent , showing a high level of smart contract integrity. The team has also announced a full CertiK audit , with results to be published upon completion. Each property listed on the platform is linked to an SPV, allowing legal and financial verification of ownership. Multi-signature wallets and oracle feeds are used to verify data before any on-chain updates occur. These practices make the system auditable and compliant with emerging DeFi standards. Token Structure and Growth Potential The token model is designed to support long-term growth. Staking allows holders to earn a share of the platform’s income, while governance tools give participants the power to vote on new property integrations and fee structures. A portion of transaction revenue is allocated for token buybacks and permanent burns, reducing total supply over time. Now, with the 100% bonus currently active , investors receive double the tokens for every purchase during the presale. This changes the potential outcomes dramatically. At the presale price of $0.025 per token , a $10,000 investment normally provides 400,000 tokens , but with the bonus , the total becomes 800,000 tokens . If the token reaches $1 , that same holding would be worth $800,000 . To hit the $1,000,000 mark , an investor would need roughly $12,500 invested at the current presale stage (since $12,500 × 2 = $25,000 worth of tokens → 1,000,000 tokens × $1 = $1,000,000). That’s the potential upside when combining early entry pricing with the bonus multiplier — an opportunity only available during the presale period. A New Direction for DeFi This crypto represents a growing movement within decentralized finance, one focused on real assets and measurable results. By connecting blockchain infrastructure with rental income and property liquidity, it creates a sustainable model that could outlast many purely speculative tokens. With its fixed supply, transparent presale system, and integration of asset-backed yield, RentStac (RNS) is shaping up to be one of the most distinctive entries in this new DeFi cycle.

Institutional capital is returning, and projects that pair innovation with credibility are set to lead the next growth phase. Among the top crypto to buy in 2025, four names consistently stand out: BlockDAG, XRP, Ethereum, and Solana. Each represents a cornerstone of crypto’s evolution, from scalability and regulation to infrastructure and adoption. BlockDAG’s record-breaking $435 million presale and rapid ecosystem expansion position it alongside XRP’s payment leadership, Ethereum’s ongoing upgrades, and Solana’s accelerating institutional inflows. Together, these projects highlight a shift toward tangible progress and real-world use cases, setting the tone for what could become crypto’s strongest cycle of sustained growth yet. BlockDAG: Countdown to Final Phase With Only 4.3B Coins Left The countdown has officially begun for BlockDAG’s Value Era. With BDAG priced at just $0.005 in Batch 32, this marks the final stage before prices climb higher. BlockDAG (BDAG) has already raised $435 million, leaving only 4.3 billion coins remaining before the presale concludes. Over 312,000 holders, 20,000+ X-Series miners sold, and 3.5 million+ X1 mobile app users form one of the largest active communities in blockchain today. This phase defines scarcity. All bonuses and promotional resets have ended, creating a structured model where each stage increases in price. Once Batch 32 is complete, the next tier will be costlier, reinforcing urgency for those tracking the best crypto to buy now. The Value Era is not marketing, it is mathematics. Every stage closed means fewer tokens at a higher rate, and each passing day narrows the discount window. BlockDAG’s appeal lies not only in price but in measurable progress. Its hybrid Proof-of-Work and Directed Acyclic Graph architecture, combined with EVM compatibility and verified audits, establishes both speed and security. As the presale moves closer to its $600 million goal, momentum continues to build across global markets. For participants seeking disciplined structure and early-stage advantage, BlockDAG’s Value Era offers clarity, scarcity, and timing, all converging right now. XRP: The Payment Powerhouse Reinventing Liquidity Few projects command institutional attention like XRP, still one of the top crypto to buy in 2025 for those betting on real-world adoption. Ripple Labs’ planned 1 billion XRP unlock, worth around $2.5 billion,has raised eyebrows across the market. While skeptics see it as a supply pressure risk, others interpret it as a step toward greater transparency and ecosystem maturity. XRP’s real strength lies in its positioning as a cross-border payment layer. With $3 billion in open interest on CME and renewed partnerships with global financial institutions, it’s clear institutional money hasn’t lost faith. The token’s near-term volatility could present entry opportunities for investors aiming for long-term exposure in global remittances. If XRP can maintain stability around its $2.30–$2.40 support while scaling up utility-based transactions, it could reassert itself as one of 2025’s most reliable Layer-1 assets. Its mix of liquidity, compliance evolution, and sustained corporate adoption makes it a compelling top crypto to buy in 2025 for risk-adjusted investors. Ethereum: A Quiet Giant Readying Its Next Leap Despite shifting narratives, Ethereum remains the anchor of Web3 infrastructure,and arguably the top crypto to buy in 2025 for institutional portfolios. While short-term ETF inflows have cooled, Ethereum’s roadmap continues to signal long-term growth. The upcoming Fusaka hard fork, scheduled for December 3, introduces PeerDAS, a feature designed to optimize data availability for roll-ups and layer-2 networks. What does this mean? Better scalability, improved efficiency, and more value flowing through its ecosystem. Ethereum is currently consolidating around the $3,865 mark, with resistance near $4,000. If this upgrade strengthens network activity and reduces congestion, ETH could see renewed upside momentum heading into 2025. While competitors like Solana and BlockDAG are gaining attention, Ethereum’s combination of maturity, liquidity, and developer dominance continues to make it a cornerstone of any diversified portfolio. For those seeking balance between innovation and stability, ETH remains a must-have among the top crypto to buy in 2025. Solana: Institutional Magnet with Record-Breaking Metrics No list of the top crypto to buy in 2025 is complete without Solana. Once written off after its network outages, Solana has bounced back stronger than ever, with $155 million in ETF inflows and more than 70 million daily transactions recorded in October. Its decentralized exchanges processed over $143 billion that same month,a staggering figure for a single-layer chain. Institutional appetite is accelerating, and Solana’s focus on speed, DeFi, and real-world scalability is paying off. Analysts from Bitwise even position Solana as one of the “two ways to win” in crypto alongside Bitcoin. The network’s next phase will depend on converting transaction volume into sustained user engagement across DeFi, gaming, and tokenized assets. If Solana maintains its upward trajectory while strengthening developer retention, it could become the fastest-growing institutional blockchain of 2025. With its tech-driven fundamentals and rising mainstream recognition, Solana sits firmly among the top crypto to buy in 2025. Final Verdict As the crypto landscape matures, this new era favors fundamentals over hype. BlockDAG’s record-breaking $435M presale, XRP’s expanding institutional presence, Ethereum’s network evolution, and Solana’s surging adoption form the backbone of the market’s next cycle. For early investors, the signal is clear: the top crypto to buy in 2025 are those solving real problems, scaling for mass use, and driving new waves of capital. Whether traders seek disruptive potential (BlockDAG), cross-border strength (XRP), proven infrastructure (Ethereum), or high-speed innovation (Solana), these four names represent the core pillars of crypto’s next bull phase. The momentum has already begun. Those who move now are positioning themselves ahead of the curve, where the next wave of value will inevitably rise.

While the general market sentiment suggests that the end of the bull cycle might be near, the latest on-chain data indicates that the premier cryptocurrency might merely be undergoing a reset. According to a blockchain firm’s report, the recent sluggishness seems to be setting the stage for the coin’s next major move. BTC Not In A Cycle Exhaustion Phase: XWIN In the latest Quicktake post on the CryptoQuant platform, XWIN Research Japan revealed that the current situation of Bitcoin looks less like the end of a cycle and more like a restructuring phase. The DeFi firm believes that the market foundations are being reset after the clearing out of excess leverage in recent weeks. Supporting the claim of reduced leverage, XWIN Research highlighted that open interest in the Bitcoin future market has reduced significantly since late October. This decline in open interest signals the exit of short-term traders from their leveraged positions. The blockchain firm noted that, in past cycle peaks, leveraged trades often increased even at high price levels. However, this euphoric buildup of market positions is not currently the case for Bitcoin, meaning that a cycle top is likely not what is being witnessed. Furthermore, XWIN Research Japan said that the Bitcoin price is currently lacking momentum and not missing structural support. The blockchain firm pinpointed declining demand from United States institutional investors—as spotlighted by the negative Coinbase Premium Index —as one of the factors behind the lack of momentum. As of this writing, Bitcoin is valued at around $101,930, reflecting no significant movement in the past 24 hours. The flagship cryptocurrency is deep in the red on the weekly timeframe, though, having suffered an 8% price decline in the last seven days. Bitcoin Market Shows Both Strengths And Weaknesses Despite the weakened institutional demand for BTC, XWIN Research highlighted some positive signs that could contribute to the cryptocurrency’s eventual recovery. For instance, the DeFi firm revealed that Bitcoin exchange reserves remain at multi-year lows, meaning that a limited supply is still available. Additionally, stablecoin liquidity is gradually flowing back into the market; this means that purchasing power is also returning, and investors might just be waiting for the right time. However, XWIN Research noted that, despite the obvious market resilience, the current sentiment suggests a range-bound movement in the short term.",Bitcoin|bitcoin|bitcoin news|bitcoin price|btc|BTC news|btc price|BTCUSDT,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|MARKET|RESEARCH|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-11-09 22:00:08

The CFTC’s acting chair has revealed exciting discussions about launching spot crypto services with major exchanges. This breakthrough could transform how Americans access cryptocurrency markets through regulated platforms. What Are CFTC Spot Crypto Services and Why Do They Matter? The Commodity Futures Trading Commission is actively working to bring regulated spot crypto services to the market. Acting Chair Caroline Pham confirmed that these discussions involve not just traditional financial giants but also innovative crypto-native platforms. This represents a significant step toward mainstream cryptocurrency adoption. These spot crypto services would allow direct trading of cryptocurrencies rather than just derivatives. The CFTC’s involvement brings crucial regulatory oversight that could boost investor confidence. Moreover, the inclusion of leveraged instruments suggests comprehensive market coverage. Which Exchanges Are Involved in These Groundbreaking Talks? The CFTC’s conversations span across diverse market participants. Traditional powerhouses like Chicago Mercantile Exchange and Cboe Futures Exchange are at the table. However, the real excitement comes from including companies like: Coinbase Derivatives Kalshi Polymarket US This diverse participation ensures that the resulting spot crypto services will serve various market segments. The blend of established institutions and innovative newcomers creates a balanced regulatory approach. How Will These New Spot Crypto Services Benefit Traders? Regulated spot crypto services offer multiple advantages for market participants. First, they provide enhanced consumer protection through established regulatory frameworks. Second, institutional investors gain comfortable entry points into cryptocurrency markets. The inclusion of leveraged products within these spot crypto services addresses sophisticated trader needs. This comprehensive approach could attract significant capital from traditional finance sectors. Furthermore, standardized procedures may reduce operational risks associated with cryptocurrency trading. What Challenges Might These Regulatory Efforts Face? Implementing spot crypto services through CFTC-regulated exchanges presents several hurdles. Regulatory clarity remains an ongoing concern across different jurisdictions. Additionally, technological integration between traditional and crypto systems requires careful planning. Market participants must adapt to new compliance requirements. However, the potential benefits of regulated spot crypto services outweigh these challenges. The CFTC’s proactive approach demonstrates commitment to fostering innovation while maintaining market integrity. When Can We Expect These Services to Launch?

Can retail investors access these new services? Yes, these services are designed to be accessible to both institutional and retail investors through regulated exchange platforms. What cryptocurrencies will be available initially? While specific assets haven’t been confirmed, major cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum are likely candidates for initial offerings. How will leverage work in these spot crypto services? Leveraged instruments will allow traders to amplify their positions, similar to margin trading in traditional markets, but with regulatory oversight.

By 2028, ADAUSD could reach $3.28 By 2031, Cardano might reach a maximum price of $10.08 Cardano is a third-generation blockchain platform launched in 2017 by Ethereum co-founder Charles Hoskinson. Designed for decentralized applications and smart contracts, it uses Ouroboros—a unique, energy-efficient Proof of Stake consensus mechanism. Cardano’s two-layer architecture separates transactions from smart contracts, enhancing scalability and flexibility. Its native cryptocurrency, ADA, is used for transaction fees, staking, and governance, allowing holders to influence the platform’s future. Emphasizing a research-driven, peer-reviewed development approach, Cardano aims to tackle blockchain challenges like scalability and sustainability, making it a strong alternative to platforms like Ethereum. Perhaps you’re wondering: with its innovative technology, can Cardano’s ADA reach new all-time highs soon? Let’s uncover what the future holds for Cardano. Overview Cryptocurrency Cardano Token ADA Price $0.5230 Market Cap $18.69B Trading Volume (24-hour) $1.86B Circulating Supply 44.99B ADA All-time High $3.10 on Sept 02, 2021 All-time Low $0.01735 on Oct 01, 2017 24-hour High $0.5624 24-hour Low $0.4934 Cardano price prediction: Technical analysis Metric Value Volatility (30-day Variation) 11.56% (Very High) 50-day SMA $ 0.7441 14-Day RSI 30.29 (Neutral) Sentiment Bearish Fear & Greed Index 21 ( Extreme Fear) Green Days 12/30 (40%) 200-day SMA $ 0.7475 Cardano (ADA) price analysis Cardano shows signs of stabilizing around the $0.52 level with oversold RSI hinting at a short-term rebound Holding above $0.50 could push ADA toward $0.55 or $0.58 in the near term A drop below $0.50 may lead to further declines toward $0.47 as momentum remains cautious Cardano price analysis 1-day chart: Cardano stabilizes near support but bearish pressure remains The 1-day chart shows Cardano trading near $0.56, following a prolonged downtrend. Price remains below the 20-day and 50-day moving averages, indicating ongoing bearish momentum. The Bollinger Bands are slightly tightening, suggesting reduced volatility and potential consolidation. ADAUSD 1-day price chart by TradingView RSI at 36 signals ADA is approaching oversold territory, which may limit further downside in the short term. If buyers step in, a rebound toward $0.60–$0.62 is possible, but meaningful trend reversal requires a breakout above the 50-day MA near $0.70. If weakness persists, the next support lies around $0.51–$0.50. Overall, ADA is stabilizing but still leans bearish. ADA price analysis 4-hour chart: Cardano holds Support at $0.55 while eyeing a break toward $0.60 resistance Cardano is showing short-term stabilization after a prior downtrend, trading near $0.56 with price consolidating between the Bollinger mid-band and lower band. The MACD is slightly positive, signaling early bullish momentum, but the slope is weak, indicating no strong trend yet. If buyers hold price above the $0.55 support zone, ADA may retest $0.59–$0.60 resistance. ADAUSD 4-hour price chart by TradingView However, rejection at this level could trigger a pullback toward $0.54 or $0.52. Overall, ADA is in a cautious recovery phase. A sustained breakout above $0.60 is needed to confirm a shift into stronger upward momentum. ADA technical indicators: Levels and action Daily simple moving average (SMA) Period Value Action SMA 3 $ 0.6719 SELL SMA 5 $ 0.6564 SELL SMA 10 $ 0.6694 SELL SMA 21 $ 0.6525 SELL SMA 50 $ 0.7441 SELL SMA 100 $ 0.7924 SELL SMA 200 $ 0.7475 SELL Daily exponential moving average (EMA) Period Value Action EMA 3 $ 0.6791 SELL EMA 5 $0.7861 SELL EMA 10 $ 0.8158 SELL EMA 21 $ 0.8344 SELL EMA 50 $ 0.8142 SELL EMA 100 $ 0.7776 SELL EMA 200 $ 0.7455 SELL What to expect from the Cardano price analysis next? Cardano’s price action currently reflects a cautious recovery phase, with the token holding above the $0.55 support level on the 4-hour chart. The RSI remains near neutral territory, suggesting neither strong bullish nor bearish dominance. The MACD shows early signs of positive momentum, indicating a possible attempt toward the $0.59–$0.60 resistance zone. However, the upper Bollinger Band is tightening, which signals reduced volatility and a potential breakout soon. If buyers sustain pressure above $0.60, ADA may target $0.63 next. Conversely, failure to hold $0.55 could trigger a decline toward $0.52 support in the short term. Is Cardano a good investment? Cardano (ADA) presents a mixed investment opportunity. It is a third-generation blockchain that aims to solve scalability issues and enhance security through its Proof-of-Stake mechanism. While some analysts predict significant price increases by 2030, others caution that it remains a high-risk investment due to the volatile nature of the crypto market. Investors should consider their risk tolerance and research before investing, as Cardano’s future performance is uncertain and contingent on market conditions and technological advancements. Will Cardano recover? Cardano’s recovery potential depends on market sentiment and adoption. Despite past challenges, its projected price increase in 2025, potentially reaching $1, has significantly bolstered confidence in the coin’s future. Will Cardano reach $5? Cardano hitting $5 seems quite achievable given past levels. With its ATH around $3.10, $5 would only need to beat that peak by about 60%. A solid bull run and some serious adoption could usher in a unit price of $5. Will Cardano reach $10? Cardano hitting $10 is a long shot. Its all-time high was around $3.10 back in 2021, so $10 would mean more than tripling that peak. From current prices, that’s over a 13x jump. While crypto can be unpredictable, that would need massive adoption and a bull run far beyond what we saw in 2021. Will Cardano reach $50? Cardano hitting $50 is extremely likely. With ADA’s current supply of around 35 billion tokens, a $50 price would require a market cap of approximately $1.75 trillion. Even in crypto’s craziest bull runs, that kind of valuation doesn’t happen for altcoins. What is the Cardano forecast for 2040? Predicting Cardano’s (ADA) price in 2040 is highly speculative as it depends on multiple factors, including adoption, regulatory developments, technological advancements, and macroeconomic conditions. However, if Cardano continues its development in smart contracts, decentralized applications (dApps), and blockchain efficiency, it could see widespread adoption, driving its price higher. Some optimistic projections suggest that ADA could reach double-digit prices, possibly ranging from $10 to $50 or more. However, in a bearish scenario, where regulatory hurdles and competition slow its progress, ADA could struggle to maintain high valuations. What will be the future price of Cardano in 2050? Predicting Cardano’s (ADA) price in 2050 is highly speculative, but if blockchain adoption continues to grow and Cardano successfully scales its smart contract ecosystem, its price could see significant appreciation. What that number will be remains to be seen. Does Cardano have a good long-term future? Cardano (ADA) has the potential for a positive long-term future, primarily driven by its technological advancements and growing ecosystem. The platform’s unique features, such as its focus on scalability and partnerships with various institutions, position it well for future adoption. However, its success will depend on overcoming regulatory scrutiny and developer engagement challenges. Recent news/opinion on Cardano Cardano has officially joined forces with the Brave browser.

Dogecoin (DOGE) price action is locked near $0.19, showing resilience against market noise. Shiba Inu (SHIB) burn rate has spiked by an incredible 71,000%, a clear sign of intense community-led scarcity. Yet, one project is fundamentally changing the discussion. BlockDAG (BDAG) has become the most important ecosystem in 2025. The presale has already secured $435M+ raised. The price is fixed at $0.005 in batch 32. Most importantly, the project has 20+ exchange listings secured before launch. BlockDAG (BDAG) is now entering its critical Value Era. This phase signals maturity, transparency, and high institutional confidence. These traits confirm its position as the top crypto to buy for smart, forward-looking traders. Shiba Inu’s Massive Burn Rate: Is Scarcity Enough? Shiba Inu’s (SHIB) burn rate has shocked the market. It saw a massive 71,687% jump in just 24 hours. This removed over 29.43 million coins from circulation. This huge deflationary event demonstrates the power of its dedicated community and the coin’s built-in scarcity plan. Over 410 trillion SHIB have been permanently destroyed. This fuels long-term optimism, even though traders remain cautious in the short term. The surge in Shiba Inu’s (SHIB) burn rate helped push the price up slightly to $0.00001043. This put the coin’s market cap back above $6 billion. Analysts suggest a sharp rally could happen if SHIB can clear resistance between $0.00001250–$0.00001350. Lower exchange inflows, down 62%, show that holders are strongly refusing to sell their supply. As the deflationary story grows stronger, SHIB remains one of the top crypto to buy for people chasing high, volatility-driven gains. Dogecoin Price: Holding as Whales Shift Dogecoin’s (DOGE) price action has found stability around $0.19. This happened despite a small 3% daily dip. It successfully holds a crucial support level. However, trading volume surged by 60%, moving past $2 billion. This signals strong market interest from both retail and large-scale traders. Whale movements are creating speculation. Over $26 million in DOGE was moved to Binance. Another $3 million was withdrawn. This suggests a complex movement of liquidity is happening before a potential price rebound. Technically, Dogecoin’s (DOGE) price action shows mixed signals. A “death cross” of the 50-day and 200-day moving averages suggests possible weakness. Yet, whale accumulation of over $134 million in recent weeks shows deep underlying support. Analysts pinpoint immediate resistance between $0.204 and $0.210. Possible breakout targets sit at $0.25, $0.33, and even $0.50. If support holds, Dogecoin could again prove why it is one of the top crypto to buy in terms of community strength and explosive potential. BlockDAG $0.005: Poised for Unstoppable Growth BlockDAG is positioning itself as a blockchain project focused on steady development and adoption. The presale is currently in Batch 32 at a price of $0.005, with more than $435 million reportedly raised. The project’s current phase, called the Value Era, represents the final stage of the presale. During this phase, all early bonuses and promotional rewards have concluded. Purchases now follow a structured vesting schedule, with 40% of coins released immediately and the remaining 60% distributed over three months. This schedule aims to promote orderly distribution and transparency. The Value Era has drawn attention from institutional participants and individual users seeking projects with clear operational frameworks. The newly updated Dashboard V4 enhances the user experience, providing live trading simulations, real-time data, and order book information. BlockDAG has also confirmed listings on 20 exchanges, increasing accessibility and liquidity. Combined with the stated $600 million presale target, these developments demonstrate a focus on systematic growth and network sustainability. By emphasizing structured coin release, active participation, and accessible tools, BlockDAG aims to support consistent adoption. The Value Era reflects the project’s approach to growth, focusing on transparency, functionality, and practical engagement with users and trading platforms. The Final Analysis: BlockDAG Is the Future Top Crypto to Buy As the market fluctuates, these three coins sit at the crossroads of movement and maturity. Shiba Inu’s (SHIB) burn rate continues to fuel deflationary dreams. Dogecoin’s (DOGE) price action shows resilience against market pressure. BlockDAG’s $0.005 Value Era positions it for a historic breakout. In a market often driven by fleeting speculation, BlockDAG’s combination of verified progress, institutional backing, and transparent structure gives it an unbeatable edge. It is not just following the market; it is actively setting its future direction. For traders seeking the top crypto to buy with high growth and reliability, the message is simple: BlockDAG is building the foundation for lasting, massive value.

This week, traders witnessed a stunning $960 gap as the market reopened, creating both excitement and opportunity for savvy investors. Understanding these CME Bitcoin futures movements can unlock valuable trading insights. What Exactly Are CME Bitcoin Futures Gaps? CME Bitcoin futures gaps occur when there’s a significant difference between Friday’s closing price and Monday’s opening price. The Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) closes for the weekend, while Bitcoin’s spot market operates 24/7. This creates a fascinating dynamic where weekend volatility directly impacts Monday’s CME Bitcoin futures opening. This recent $960 gap saw contracts jump from $104,160 to $105,120. The substantial movement demonstrates how weekend trading activity in the spot market can create immediate opportunities when CME Bitcoin futures resume trading. Why Do CME Futures Gaps Matter for Traders? Traders closely monitor CME Bitcoin futures gaps because they often present predictable trading patterns. Many investors watch for these gaps to fill, meaning the price tends to move back toward the original closing level. However, this isn’t guaranteed – sometimes gaps expand further. Price discovery : Gaps reveal hidden weekend market sentiment Trading signals : Large gaps often indicate strong momentum Risk management : Understanding gaps helps set appropriate stop losses Opportunity identification : Gaps can highlight undervalued or overvalued conditions How Can You Profit from CME Bitcoin Futures Gaps? Successful traders develop strategies around CME Bitcoin futures gaps. The key lies in understanding whether a gap will fill or continue expanding. Historical data shows that most CME gaps eventually fill, but timing is crucial. Consider these approaches when trading CME Bitcoin futures gaps: Wait for confirmation before entering trades Use multiple time frame analysis Monitor spot market correlations Set realistic profit targets based on gap size What Makes This $960 Gap So Significant? This particular CME Bitcoin futures gap of $960 represents substantial weekend volatility. The size indicates strong market movement during the CME’s closure, potentially driven by major news events or institutional activity. Such large gaps in CME Bitcoin futures often precede significant price trends. Traders should note that larger gaps typically take longer to fill, if they fill at all. The current CME Bitcoin futures environment suggests continued institutional interest and market maturity. Mastering CME Bitcoin Futures Trading Understanding CME Bitcoin futures gaps provides a competitive edge in cryptocurrency trading. These patterns offer valuable insights into market sentiment and potential price movements. By monitoring CME Bitcoin futures activity, traders can make more informed decisions and potentially capitalize on these predictable patterns. The $960 gap serves as a powerful reminder that cryptocurrency markets never sleep, even when traditional exchanges close. This creates unique opportunities for alert traders who understand how CME Bitcoin futures interact with continuous spot markets. Frequently Asked Questions What causes CME Bitcoin futures gaps? CME Bitcoin futures gaps occur because the exchange closes on weekends while Bitcoin’s spot market trades continuously. Weekend price movements create the difference between Friday’s close and Monday’s open. How often do CME futures gaps fill? Most CME Bitcoin futures gaps eventually fill, though the timing varies. Some fill within days, while others may take weeks. Larger gaps typically take longer to close. Are CME gaps reliable trading signals? While CME gaps provide valuable information, they shouldn’t be used as standalone signals. Combine gap analysis with other technical indicators and market fundamentals for better accuracy. Can retail traders benefit from CME gaps? Absolutely. Both institutional and retail traders can develop strategies around CME Bitcoin futures gaps. The key is understanding the patterns and managing risk appropriately. How large was the largest recorded CME Bitcoin futures gap? The largest CME Bitcoin futures gaps have exceeded $2,000 during periods of extreme market volatility, though gaps typically range from $200 to $1,200. Do CME gaps affect Bitcoin’s spot price?

The paper reported, without citing sources, that a letter of intent to resolve the trade deadlock is expected in the coming weeks, ahead of a deal set to be presented at the World Economic Forum in Davos this January. The report continued to indicate that Trump and next year’s Swiss President Guy Parmelin, who is also the economy minister, are expected to unveil a plan for U.S. import duties. These duties will be similar to the 15% tariffs Washington has already agreed with the European Union, assuming all goes as planned. Swiss business leaders push for trade relief with Trump The Swiss Economic Affairs Ministry did not comment on the report, which follows a visit by Swiss business leaders with Trump on Tuesday. It stated that the meeting, which included executives from MSC, Rolex, Partners Group, Mercuria, and Richemont, as well as MKS, was a private initiative that it supported, but conducted independently of its own efforts. The Swiss ministry stated that the Federal Council is primarily responsible for negotiations with the relevant U.S. authorities, and that Federal Councillor Parmelin maintains regular contact with U.S. officials, including Trade Representative Jamieson Greer. During the visit, the Swiss delegation presented Trump with a Rolex watch for his presidential library and a specially engraved gold bar, according to Blick. The delegation also pledged to work toward reducing the U.S. trade deficit with Switzerland over the next five to seven years. Other proposals included relocating gold smelting operations to the United States within the next 12 to 24 months and supporting U.S. infrastructure projects. Investments in pharmaceuticals and an increase in Swiss purchases of aircraft from American manufacturers were also discussed. Trump showed goodwill towards the proposals, Blick said, while on Friday Greer spoke with Parmelin and Helene Budliger-Artieda from the State Secretariat for Economic Affairs (SECO) in talks the Swiss side described as “very constructive.” Government negotiations continue amid private-sector initiative Trump had initially imposed a 39% tariff on the country, threatening to drive up costs for chocolatiers, including Lindt , and watchmakers such as the Swatch Group and Rolex SA. Swiss diplomats have also been engaged in negotiations with officials in Washington, hoping to have the levy reduced. The Swiss government was informed about the private-sector push; however, it didn’t control it, according to the Economy Ministry in Bern. “This is a private initiative by Swiss business leaders, which the State Secretariat for Economic Affairs supported in its preparation, but is taking place independently of the Federal Council’s involvement in this matter,” a spokesperson said in an email. The ministry also said that it “welcomes the commitment shown by the companies concerned,” however, that the government remains in charge of negotiations. Economy Minister Guy Parmelin is in regular contact with U.S. authorities, including Trade Representative Jamieson Greer, according to the statement. In a social media post last week, Trump said it was “my Great Honor to just meet with high-level Representatives of Switzerland. We discussed many subjects, including, and most importantly, Trade and Trade Imbalance.” He said Greer will “discuss the subjects further with Switzerland’s Leaders.” The White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment on who Trump met with. The Swiss government declined to comment, saying it’s up to the executives to disclose their involvement. The U.S. scrapped plans to impose tariffs on gold bars from Switzerland earlier this year after the proposal shocked global markets and threatened to disrupt supplies. Switzerland has recently proposed relocating some of its gold refining operations to the US as part of a bid to broker a broader trade deal. As part of these efforts, top Swiss trade diplomat Helene Budliger Artieda has made several trips to Washington in recent weeks. The smartest crypto minds already read our newsletter. Want in?

Notably, this activity may comprise leveraged options and is scheduled for early next month. Sources noted that this report was legitimate after Pham acknowledged the announcement through a shared X post where she briefly said “True,” in response to an article released on Sunday, November 9. The move comes as the federal government is shut down, which has impacted other crypto policy efforts. It would move away from current US rules, which largely limit leveraged trading to derivatives, such as futures and perpetual contracts, rather than the actual crypto assets underlying them. Pham hints at the beginning of leveraged spot crypto trading Regarding the announcement that Pham acknowledged efforts to start leveraged spot crypto trading. Sources have pointed out that the news illustrates that the acting chair has been actively negotiating with CFTC-regulated designated contracts markets (DCMs) exchanges to reach an agreement. This group comprises leading financial firms like ICE Futures, CME, and Cboe Futures Exchange. Additionally, it includes crypto-focused companies such as Coinbase Derivatives, Kalshi prediction markets, and US-based Polymarket. Sources close to the situation indicated that their discussions focus on the launch of spot crypto trading products that involve leverage, financing options, and margin. As we work with Congress to further clarify these markets via new legislation, we are also using our existing authority to adopt the President’s Working Group on Digital Asset Market s recommendations rapidly,” said Pham in a statement. Analysts noted that this crucial step marks a significant shift in the US regulators’ approach to managing crypto markets. For example, Pham is utilizing current regulations from the Commodity Exchange Act rather than waiting for Congress to grant the CFTC clear authority over spot crypto markets. Concerning the current regulations, it is worth noting that these rules highlight that retail trading of commodities with margin, financing, or leverage must be conducted on regulated exchanges. With leveraged spot crypto trading implemented, investors can borrow funds to boost their investment in digital currencies like Ether and Bitcoin. As a result, they could gain both substantial profits and larger losses. In this type of trading, participants typically issue part of the total trade value as collateral, known as margin, while the broker or exchange covers the remaining amount. For instance, if a trader uses 5x leverage, they could manage $5,000 worth of bitcoin by investing only $1,000 of their own cash. While these products have been available on international crypto exchanges for several years, sources acknowledge that providing them on CFTC-regulated platforms has an added advantage. It will introduce enhanced surveillance, risk management, and safeguard measures for investors for leveraged crypto trading in the US. Pham pushes leveraged spot crypto trading despite government shutdown The CFTC typically has five commissioners who come from diverse political origins. However, following the current situation, Pham is the only commissioner left, and the other positions remain vacant. This grants her more authority to lead the federal agency. Interestingly, Pham has not halted her efforts even as the government is in a shutdown that has held up the possibility of confirming Mike Selig, currently the chief counsel for the SEC’s Crypto Task Force and Trump’s pick to head that agency. Pham is expected to assume the role of global crypto payments company MoonPay’s chief legal officer and chief administrative officer after her time at the CFTC. However, sources discovered that the acting chair’s confirmation post did not mention plans about MoonPay. When reporters contacted Pham and the CFTC for comment on the situation, they did not respond immediately. Get seen where it counts.

Both of these companies share a major financial backer in Tether Holdings, and the takeover is expected to support Rumble’s effort to expand from video hosting into cloud infrastructure. The offer being discussed would give Northern Data shareholders fewer shares of Rumble than previously proposed, so the exchange ratio has changed from 2.319 Rumble shares for each Northern Data share to around 2 shares. The earlier plan had projected a combined company worth about $4.5 billion with Northern Data investors holding a third of the new entity. Due to declining stock prices on both sides, the combined valuation now sits near $2.9 billion. Stake terms adjusted and loan forgiveness included As part of the deal structure , Tether would forgo a significant portion of a €575 million loan issued to Northern Data. Confidence around Northern Data weakened after news that European prosecutors opened a criminal investigation into the company. Authorities are examining whether Northern Data purchased large quantities of GPUs for a facility in northern Sweden while claiming tax incentives meant for artificial intelligence computing. Investigators are reviewing whether those GPUs were actually used for crypto mining instead. The investigation pushed the company’s share price lower and intensified the urgency to resolve its financial position. Last week, Northern Data sold its mining division, Peak Mining, for up to $200 million. The buyer was not publicly identified, though individuals familiar with the matter said the buyer is also connected to Tether. The sale removes a unit that had drawn regulatory attention and allows Northern Data to focus on its cloud and high-performance computing operations ahead of the anticipated merger. Tether profit strength drives influence across sectors At the same time, Tether is reporting record financial performance. Paolo Ardoino, chief executive of Tether, said, “This year we’re going to approach another $15 billion profit. That’s very rare,” during remarks in Lugano at the Plan B Forum. USDT, the stablecoin issued by Tether, has around $183 billion in circulation and accounts for about 60% of the stablecoin market. Even with these profits, outside firms have expressed interest in investing. Talks have taken place about raising up to $20 billion in exchange for roughly a 3% stake, which would value Tether at around $500 billion. Paolo said many companies are approaching them, stating, “We have been contacted by an enormous amount of companies that want to invest in us. We have to draw a line in the sand on a valuation that we think is very cheap.” Tether is preparing to re-enter the United States later next year through a new stablecoin project called USAT that reportedly aligns with pro-crypto policies under President Donald Trump. Tether now owns an 11.5% stake in Italian football club Juventus. Paolo and Tether chairman Giancarlo Devasini have supported the club since childhood. Tether has nominated two individuals to join Juventus’ board at the next shareholder meeting, including its deputy chief investment officer and a local orthodontic specialist.

Trump’s comments came after Politico revealed that senators had reached a partial agreement to end the shutdown.

Political divisions often stall agreements, and compromises must address core issues like budget allocations and policy demands. Moreover, public pressure mounts as the shutdown drags on, making timely action essential. However, the reported partial deal indicates that lawmakers are willing to find common ground, which could pave the way for a full resolution. Actionable Insights: What Can You Do During a Government Shutdown? If you’re impacted by the government shutdown, staying informed and proactive is key.

This development comes as welcome relief to thousands of federal employees and marks a crucial step toward restoring normal government operations after weeks of uncertainty. What Does the Government Shutdown Agreement Include? The partial government shutdown deal emerged from negotiations between Senators Angus King, Jeanne Shaheen, and Maggie Hassan working with Republican colleagues. According to Politico reports, the agreement centers on a temporary spending bill that already passed the House on Sunday. This bill serves as the foundation for what could become a more comprehensive budget solution. Moreover, Senate Majority Leader John Thune has committed to providing Senate Democrats with a December vote on extending Affordable Care Act subsidies. This concession represents a key compromise in the government shutdown negotiations. How Will This Government Shutdown Resolution Affect Federal Workers? The immediate impact of this government shutdown agreement brings substantial relief to furloughed employees. Here’s what the deal means for them: Federal employees return to work immediately All unpaid wages will be provided Government services resume normal operations Uncertainty about paycheck timing ends This government shutdown resolution ensures that essential services can continue without further disruption. The return of federal workers means agencies can address backlogs that accumulated during the shutdown period. What Comes Next in the Government Shutdown Process? While this represents significant progress, the government shutdown solution remains partial. The Senate must still formalize the agreement through official voting procedures. Democrats will have additional opportunities to decide on votes for other policy extensions beyond the healthcare subsidies. The temporary nature of this government shutdown agreement means lawmakers will need to continue working toward a more permanent budget solution. However, this breakthrough demonstrates that bipartisan cooperation can produce results even in politically challenging circumstances. Why Does This Government Shutdown Resolution Matter? This government shutdown agreement matters beyond immediate political headlines. It shows that our democratic institutions can still function effectively when lawmakers prioritize practical solutions over partisan politics.

Frequently Asked Questions When will federal employees return to work? Federal employees will return to work immediately once the agreement is finalized and implemented. Will furloughed workers receive back pay? Yes, the agreement specifies that all furloughed employees will receive any unpaid wages from the shutdown period. What happens to the temporary spending bill? The Senate will vote on the temporary spending bill that passed the House, using it as a foundation for broader budget negotiations. Are the Affordable Care Act subsidies guaranteed? Senate Democrats have been promised a vote in December on extending the subsidies, but the outcome will depend on that vote. Is this a permanent solution to the government shutdown? This is a partial agreement that resolves the immediate shutdown but requires further work on a comprehensive budget deal. How long did the government shutdown last? The duration varied by agency, but this agreement ends the shutdown period for all affected government operations. Help spread this important news!

Major cryptocurrency projects are scheduled to release millions of dollars worth of tokens into circulation between November 10-16, with APT leading the way at $36.19 million. Understanding these token unlocks is crucial for any serious crypto investor looking to navigate market volatility. Why Should You Care About Token Unlocks? Token unlocks represent scheduled releases of previously locked cryptocurrency tokens into the market. These events can significantly impact prices and trading volumes. When large amounts of tokens become available, they often create selling pressure that affects market dynamics. However, smart investors use this information to make informed decisions about their portfolios. This Week’s Major Token Unlock Schedule The upcoming week features several substantial token unlocks across multiple blockchain projects. According to Tokenomist data, here are the key events you need to monitor: November 10 – LINEA: 2.88 billion tokens ($36.01 million) at 11:00 a.m. UTC November 11 – APT: 11.31 million tokens ($36.19 million) at 6:00 a.m. UTC November 13 – AVAX: 1.67 million tokens ($29.52 million) at 12:00 a.m. UTC – CHEEL: 20.81 million tokens ($13.73 million) at 12:00 a.m. UTC November 15 – CONX: 2.32 million tokens ($29.22 million) at 12:00 a.m. UTC – STRK: 127 million tokens ($18.79 million) at 12:00 a.m. UTC – WCT: 125 million tokens ($15.61 million) at 12:00 a.m. UTC – SEI: 55.56 million tokens ($10.14 million) at 12:00 p.m. UTC November 16 – ARB: 92.65 million tokens ($27.63 million) at 1:00 p.m. UTC How Do Token Unlocks Affect Market Prices? These token unlock events create both risks and opportunities for investors. When tokens become available, early investors and team members might sell their holdings, potentially driving prices down. However, well-managed projects often see these events as milestones that bring more liquidity and participation to their ecosystems. The percentage of circulating supply being unlocked is particularly important. For example, WCT’s unlock represents 65.21% of its circulating supply, which could have a massive impact compared to APT’s 0.49% release. Strategic Approaches to Token Unlock Events Smart investors don’t just watch these token unlocks – they plan around them. Some traders use these events to enter positions at potentially lower prices, while others might temporarily reduce exposure to affected assets. The key is understanding each project’s fundamentals and how the unlock aligns with its development roadmap. Monitoring token unlock calendars should be part of every crypto investor’s routine. These scheduled events provide predictable market-moving catalysts that can be factored into trading strategies and long-term investment plans. What Makes This Week’s Token Unlocks Significant? This week stands out due to the concentration of major token unlocks across multiple prominent projects. The combined value exceeds $200 million, representing one of the most active unlock weeks in recent memory. The diversity of projects involved – from layer-1 blockchains to gaming tokens – means the impact will be felt across multiple cryptocurrency sectors. FAQs About Token Unlocks What exactly are token unlocks? Token unlocks refer to scheduled releases of cryptocurrency tokens that were previously locked or vested, making them available for trading or selling. Why do projects schedule token unlocks? Projects use token unlocks to gradually release tokens to team members, investors, and advisors while maintaining price stability during early stages. How do token unlocks affect prices? Token unlocks often create selling pressure as recipients may cash out, potentially causing temporary price declines before markets absorb the new supply. Should I sell before a token unlock? This depends on the project’s fundamentals, the unlock size relative to circulating supply, and your investment strategy – there’s no one-size-fits-all answer. Where can I find token unlock schedules? Platforms like Tokenomist, CoinMarketCap, and project official documentation provide comprehensive token unlock calendars. Do all token unlocks cause price drops? Not necessarily – well-communicated unlocks in fundamentally strong projects sometimes have minimal impact or can even be bullish if demand exceeds new supply.

The latest data reveals the Altcoin Season Index currently stands at 31, sparking important questions about market direction and investment opportunities. This crucial metric serves as your compass in the volatile cryptocurrency landscape. What Exactly is the Altcoin Season Index? The Altcoin Season Index acts as a powerful thermometer measuring market sentiment. Created by CoinMarketCap, this innovative tool compares the performance of the top 100 cryptocurrencies against Bitcoin over 90 days. However, it excludes stablecoins and wrapped tokens to provide a pure measurement of market dynamics. When this index hits 75 or higher, we officially enter an altcoin season. This means at least 75% of major altcoins have outperformed Bitcoin during the measurement period. Currently sitting at 31, we’re clearly in Bitcoin-dominated territory, but the index provides valuable clues about potential shifts ahead. Why Should You Care About This Number? Understanding the Altcoin Season Index gives you a strategic advantage in portfolio management. Here’s what the current reading tells us: Bitcoin dominance continues – Most altcoins are underperforming BTC Potential accumulation phase – Lower prices may present buying opportunities Early warning system – Rising index values signal changing market conditions Risk assessment tool – Helps gauge when to shift between BTC and altcoins How Can You Use This Information Strategically? The current Altcoin Season Index reading of 31 suggests several actionable insights for savvy investors. First, recognize that we’re still in a Bitcoin-led market cycle. This means your portfolio should maintain significant Bitcoin exposure while selectively accumulating promising altcoins at discounted prices. Monitor the index weekly for any upward movement. A consistent climb above 50 could signal the early stages of an altcoin season approaching. Many successful investors use these transition periods to rebalance their holdings before major price movements occur. What Historical Patterns Reveal About Future Movements Historical data shows that the Altcoin Season Index typically moves in cycles. Periods of Bitcoin dominance often precede explosive altcoin rallies. The current low reading might actually represent a prime opportunity for strategic positioning. Previous cycles demonstrate that when the index rapidly climbs from low levels, the resulting altcoin season can generate substantial returns for early investors. However, timing remains challenging, which is why gradual accumulation during low-index periods often proves most effective. Key Takeaways for Your Investment Strategy The Altcoin Season Index at 31 delivers a clear message: patience and preparation are essential. While we’re not in altcoin season yet, the groundwork is being laid for potential future opportunities. Use this time to research fundamentally strong projects and establish entry points that align with your risk tolerance. Remember that successful cryptocurrency investing requires both discipline and timing. The index provides valuable data, but your personal strategy should consider multiple factors including project fundamentals, market sentiment, and overall portfolio goals. Frequently Asked Questions What triggers an altcoin season? Altcoin seasons typically occur when market confidence expands beyond Bitcoin, often driven by new technological developments, increased institutional interest in alternative cryptocurrencies, or Bitcoin price stability that encourages investors to seek higher returns elsewhere. How often does the Altcoin Season Index update? The index updates regularly on CoinMarketCap, typically reflecting the most recent 90-day performance data. For the most current readings, check the platform directly. Should I sell my Bitcoin when altcoin season arrives? Not necessarily. Many investors maintain Bitcoin exposure while allocating a portion of their portfolio to altcoins during these periods. Diversification helps manage risk while capturing potential upside. Can the index predict exact timing of altcoin seasons? While the Altcoin Season Index indicates conditions, it cannot predict exact timing. Use it as one tool among many in your market analysis toolkit. What other indicators should I watch with this index? Combine the Altcoin Season Index with Bitcoin dominance charts, trading volume analysis, and fundamental project research for comprehensive market understanding. How long do altcoin seasons typically last? Historical altcoin seasons have varied from several weeks to multiple months, depending on market conditions and broader economic factors.

With Stage 6 of its presale already being 85% sold, Mutuum Finance is one of the top candidates for next crypto to explode for Q4 of this year and into 2026 because demand is escalating at a rate that defies estimates and predictions currently available on market research platforms available online today. XRP Price Pressure Intensifies XRP has had a tough week, falling more than 10% as it maintains its tight range between $2.16 and $2.52, exactly on the Fibonacci support level of 0.382. While efforts are being made by bulls to protect this region, presently, however, XRP is finding it tough to move past its EMA resistance levels, thereby preventing it from moving up significantly. To get its momentum back, XRP would need to get past its present resistance of $2.52, potentially opening up a way towards $2.77-$3.10. But if this resistance is not negated, then forecasts point towards a possible fall towards $1.94. However, one thing that is keeping market participants up is that open interest is increasing, thereby foretelling that soon a huge volatility is due, though whether it would be up or down is still unclear. It is this kind of uncertainty that has made many investors, who would have liked more predictable upside potential, look towards Mutuum Finance (MUTM) as a relatively better growth option at this point of time, positioning it as the next crypto to explode. Mutuum Finance presale enters fresh growth phase Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is still gathering pace across the DeFi space as it nears its final stages of presale. Mutuum Finance is currently at an advanced stage of completion at 85% of Phase 6, indicating that this is one of the most engaged projects in DeFi that has emerged recently on a decentralized finance platform. At this point, at a price of $0.035 for Phase 6, investors have a final opportunity before investing, as it is expected that this presale is set to soar as soon as it enters Phase 7, at a price of $0.04 per token. Mutuum Finance has received more than 17,810 supporters and has reached more than $18.5 million in presale funding. That, however, is not all, as Mutuum Finance’s attractiveness lies in its utility-focused model, development roadmap, and emphasis on establishing a transparent and sustainable lending platform. With this basic framework, Mutuum Finance remains the new crypto coin to buy, having carved its niche within a competitive market. Imminent testnet launch for core DeFi functionality Additionally, one of the most notable milestones is expected in Q4 of 2025, and that will be when they roll out their test network, Sepolia, and this project brings about the first live environment that incorporates the Mutuum Finance loaning and value creation system. Users will be able to obtain funding by providing collateral through ETH and USDT, and they can earn more value through their mtTokens that earn them MUTM rewards. Additionally, Mutuum Finance will be able to test and develop other essential operating functions on its testnet, such as risk management, rate of interest, as well as loan algorithms, before fully implementing them on its mainnet platform as a result of its testnet opening. All these measures demonstrate Mutuum Finance’s focused attention to its longevity and success on its platform. While excitement and anticipation continue to build, Mutuum Finance is being looked at as one of the projects that is set for considerable growth and development within the DeFi space, thereby making MUTM one of the cryptos that need close monitoring as the market approaches its next crypto to explode, and solidifying it as the next crypto to explode in the upcoming cycle.

This nightmare became reality for South Korean personality Han Hye-jin, whose channel was hijacked and deleted after broadcasting a fraudulent cryptocurrency live stream. The incident highlights growing security threats in the crypto space that can impact even established creators. What Exactly Happened in This XRP Hack? Early on July 10, Han Hye-jin’s YouTube channel began airing a suspicious live stream titled “Ripple (XRP): CEO Brad Garlinghouse’s Growth Forecast.” The broadcast, which had comments disabled, falsely claimed to feature Ripple’s CEO discussing market insights and XRP strategies. This XRP hack represents a sophisticated social engineering attack that exploited both the channel’s credibility and viewers’ interest in cryptocurrency news. How Do These Cryptocurrency Hacks Occur? Cybercriminals typically use phishing techniques to gain access to YouTube accounts. They might send fake login alerts or partnership offers that trick creators into revealing their credentials. Once inside, hackers can: Change channel passwords and recovery options Delete existing content and upload fraudulent streams Disable comments to prevent viewer warnings Promote fake cryptocurrency giveaways or investments The XRP hack on Han Hye-jin’s channel followed this pattern precisely, using Ripple’s reputation to lend credibility to their scam. Why Are Crypto-Related Channels Targeted? Cryptocurrency channels attract substantial attention from investors seeking quick profits and market insights. Hackers capitalize on this enthusiasm by: Leveraging established trust in popular creators Exploiting FOMO (Fear Of Missing Out) among viewers Using technical jargon that confuses less experienced investors Promising unrealistic returns or exclusive opportunities The recent XRP hack demonstrates how attackers manipulate both platform vulnerabilities and psychological triggers. What Can Content Creators Learn From This XRP Hack? This incident serves as a crucial warning for all digital creators. Implement these security measures immediately: Enable two-factor authentication on all accounts Use unique, strong passwords for each platform Verify suspicious emails through official channels Regularly monitor account activity and connected devices Educate team members about phishing attempts Proactive security could have prevented this devastating XRP hack and channel deletion. How Can Viewers Protect Themselves From Similar Scams? Cryptocurrency enthusiasts must remain vigilant when consuming online content. Always: Verify unusual streams through official social media accounts Be skeptical of promises offering guaranteed returns Research investment opportunities independently Report suspicious content to platform moderators immediately Remember that legitimate companies rarely promote through hacked channels The XRP hack incident reminds us that if an opportunity seems too good to be true, it probably is. What Does This Mean For Cryptocurrency Security? This XRP hack represents a broader trend of digital security challenges in the crypto space. As blockchain technology evolves, so do the methods criminals use to exploit it. The incident underscores the importance of: Platform-level security improvements from companies like YouTube Increased creator education about digital safety practices Collaboration between crypto projects and content platforms Transparent communication during security incidents Ultimately, protecting digital assets requires vigilance from all parties involved. Frequently Asked Questions How did hackers access Han Hye-jin’s YouTube channel? While the exact method remains unconfirmed, similar incidents typically involve phishing attacks where creators unknowingly provide login credentials through fake security alerts or partnership offers. Can deleted YouTube channels be recovered? Sometimes, if reported quickly enough. However, recovery depends on YouTube’s policies and the extent of damage. Immediate reporting to YouTube support offers the best chance. What makes cryptocurrency channels particularly vulnerable? Their audience often includes investors seeking quick information, making them more likely to engage with fraudulent investment schemes promoted through hacked channels. How can I identify a hacked YouTube stream? Look for red flags like disabled comments, unusual streaming times, promises of guaranteed returns, and content that doesn’t match the channel’s typical style. Has Ripple commented on this incident? As of publication, Ripple hasn’t issued an official statement, but companies typically distance themselves from unauthorized uses of their executives’ names and branding. Are there legal consequences for these hackers? Yes, unauthorized computer access, fraud, and impersonation carry serious legal penalties, though international jurisdiction complicates prosecution.

The company, founded in Paris in 2014, has reported record revenues in 2025, reaching triple-digit millions, driven by both individual and institutional demand. CEO Pascal Gauthier told the Financial Times that this year has been the company’s strongest yet, as hackers increasingly target digital assets. “We’re being hacked more and more every day … hacking of your bank accounts, of your crypto, and it’s not going to get better next year and the year after that,” he said. Crypto Thefts Hit New Highs The surge in Ledger sales coincides with a record year for crypto-related thefts. According to Chainalysis, hackers stole $2.2 billion worth of digital assets in the first half of 2025, surpassing the total losses recorded in all of 2024. Approximately 23% of these attacks targeted individual wallets, highlighting the growing need for secure hardware solutions. Ledger Secures $100 Billion in Bitcoin Gauthier revealed that Ledger currently secures around $100 billion worth of Bitcoin for its customers. He also suggested that the company may benefit from seasonal spikes in sales during Black Friday and the Christmas period. Looking ahead, Ledger plans to raise funds in 2026, either through a private funding round or a US listing. The company is increasing its New York headcount, with Gauthier noting, “money is in New York today for crypto, it’s nowhere else in the world, it’s certainly not in Europe.” Competitors such as Trezor and Tangem offer similar “cold storage” wallets, but Ledger remains the market leader. The company was last valued at $1.5 billion in 2023, with backing from 10T Holdings and True Global Ventures. Multisig App Upgrade Sparks Debate Last month, Ledger launched a new multisignature (multisig) interface, receiving mixed reactions from its user base, as reported by Bitzuma . While many praised the upgrade as a technical improvement, the new fee structure—including a $10 flat fee per transaction and a 0.05% variable fee for token transfers—drew criticism. Developers such as pcaversaccio accused Ledger of moving away from its Cypherpunk roots, arguing the app has become a centralized “choke point” aimed at extracting revenue from users.",Crypto News|Crypto Intelligence,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|FIAT|WALLET|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2025-11-10 01:54:18

BitMEX founder Arthur Hayes certainly thinks so. In his recent social media analysis, Hayes made a compelling Bitcoin surge prediction that has the crypto community buzzing with excitement and anticipation. Why This Bitcoin Surge Prediction Matters Now Arthur Hayes, the visionary behind BitMEX, dropped a bombshell on social media platform X. He declared that the U.S. government has returned to its primary business of printing money and distributing benefits. This monetary policy shift, according to Hayes, will directly fuel a significant price increase for both Bitcoin and privacy-focused cryptocurrency ZEC. Hayes’s analysis comes at a critical time when investors are searching for reliable indicators in the volatile crypto market. His track record in the cryptocurrency space lends substantial credibility to this Bitcoin surge prediction , making it essential reading for anyone involved in digital assets. How Money Printing Powers Cryptocurrency Growth When governments increase money supply through quantitative easing or stimulus programs, several key effects typically follow: Traditional currency devaluation occurs Investors seek inflation-resistant assets Cryptocurrencies become attractive alternatives Digital gold narratives gain strength This economic environment creates perfect conditions for Hayes’s Bitcoin surge prediction to materialize. Historically, periods of aggressive money printing have correlated strongly with cryptocurrency price increases. What Makes ZEC Part of This Surge Prediction? While Bitcoin often dominates cryptocurrency discussions, Hayes specifically included ZEC in his analysis. Zcash offers enhanced privacy features that appeal to investors concerned about financial surveillance. As monetary policies become more invasive, privacy-focused cryptocurrencies may experience disproportionate growth. The dual focus in this Bitcoin surge prediction highlights how different cryptocurrency segments can benefit from the same macroeconomic trends. Investors should consider diversifying across both established and specialized digital assets. Actionable Insights From This Analysis How can investors position themselves based on this Bitcoin surge prediction ? Consider these strategic approaches: Dollar-cost average into Bitcoin positions Research privacy coin fundamentals Monitor Federal Reserve announcements Set realistic profit-taking targets Remember that while Hayes’s analysis provides valuable insight, cryptocurrency investments always carry risk. Never invest more than you can afford to lose, and consider consulting with financial professionals. The Bigger Picture: Cryptocurrency as Monetary Hedge This Bitcoin surge prediction reinforces cryptocurrency’s evolving role in global finance. As traditional monetary systems face stress tests, digital assets increasingly serve as: Inflation protection mechanisms Borderless value transfer systems Financial sovereignty tools Technological innovation platforms The current economic climate may accelerate adoption across all these use cases, potentially validating Hayes’s optimistic outlook. Frequently Asked Questions What exactly did Arthur Hayes predict? Arthur Hayes predicted that both Bitcoin and ZEC will experience significant price increases due to resumed money printing by the U.S. government. Why does money printing affect cryptocurrency prices? Increased money supply typically devalues traditional currency, making limited-supply assets like Bitcoin more attractive as stores of value. How reliable are cryptocurrency price predictions? While experts like Hayes provide valuable analysis, cryptocurrency markets remain highly volatile and unpredictable. Always conduct your own research. Should I invest based on this prediction? Use expert predictions as one data point among many in your investment research. Never make financial decisions based solely on any single analysis. What makes ZEC different from Bitcoin? Zcash offers enhanced privacy features through zero-knowledge proofs, while Bitcoin transactions are publicly visible on the blockchain. When does Hayes expect this surge to happen? Hayes didn’t specify exact timing, focusing instead on the causal relationship between money printing and cryptocurrency valuation increases.

During an interview on CBS’s “Face the Nation” on Sunday, November 9, Hassett noted that the lack of air traffic controllers is causing significant travel disruptions as Thanksgiving approaches. “Thanksgiving is one of the busiest times of the year for the economy… and if people can’t travel during that period, we could see a negative quarter for the fourth quarter,” the White House economic adviser explained . Flight delays in the US hinder traveling as Thanksgiving approaches On Sunday, US-based airlines canceled over 2,200 flights, raising concerns among passengers. To address these concerns, the country’s Secretary of Transportation, Sean Duffy, cautioned that air travel will slow down to a “trickle” because air traffic control was experiencing staffing shortages as Thanksgiving draws near. He attributed this situation to the ongoing federal shutdown. His statement came after several airlines reportedly faced their third consecutive day of mandatory flight cuts due to delays and cancellations that interfered with travel schedules on Saturday, November 8. Notably, the federal shutdown has lasted 40 days , resulting in a shortage of air traffic controllers, who, like other federal employees, have not received pay for weeks. “It’s only going to get worse… during the two weeks before Thanksgiving, you’ll see air travel drop significantly,” Duffy stated on CNN’s “State of the Union.” These US flight delays have disrupted the plans of millions of individuals, as most of them had preferred to travel before Thanksgiving. This event is one of the significant holidays in the country, taking place on November 27 this year. Still, Duffy warned that many individuals will be unable to board airplanes as there will be insufficient flights if this situation remains unchanged. Following his remarks, analysts noted that Sunday was the worst day for flight cancellations since the shutdown kicked off on October 1. Meanwhile, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has instructed airlines to reduce their daily flights by 4% starting this Friday. This order will be enforced at 40 major airports because of safety concerns regarding air traffic control. Sources mentioned that these flight cutbacks are set to escalate to 6% on Tuesday and reach 10% by November 14. Following the FAA’s instructions, many airlines have already made their cancellations for the upcoming days public. For example, United Airlines shared its intention to cancel 190 flights on Monday and 269 on Tuesday, according to the company. The ongoing federal shutdown raises tension in the airline industry On Sunday, 4:20 p.m. ET (2120 GMT), at least 2,215 US flights had been cancelled and more than 7,200 delayed as conditions worsened, according to FlightAware, a flight tracking website. Additionally, the FAA reported that 12 control towers experienced staffing issues earlier. Apart from these challenges, Duffy highlighted that more air traffic controllers have retired since the federal shutdown started on October 1. This was after he told reporters that the FAA is short about 1,000 to 2,000 controllers for full staffing. He further explained that he paid skilled controllers to perform their task and not retire. According to him, he had about four controllers retiring per day before the shutdown, and now the number has increased to around 15 to 20 per day. On Saturday alone, approximately 1,550 flights were canceled and 6,700 were delayed. That was up from 1,025 cancellations and 7,000 delays reported on Friday. Sources close to the situation mentioned that Airline officials privately stated that they could schedule and plan very few flights because several were delayed. They expressed worry about how the system would function if staffing problems further deteriorate. Meanwhile, the Senate is moving toward a deal to reopen the government, which would fund operations through January 2026.

That’s exactly what the Bank of Korea is proposing in their groundbreaking new approach to bank-led stablecoins . This strategic move could reshape how we think about digital money and financial stability. Why Is the Bank of Korea Pushing for Bank-Led Stablecoins? The Bank of Korea recently released a white paper that makes a compelling case for bank-led stablecoins as the future of digital currency. Their recommendation centers on having banks take the lead in stablecoin issuance rather than allowing non-bank entities to dominate this emerging market. This approach directly contrasts with current U.S. policy under the Trump administration. What makes this development particularly interesting is the Bank of Korea’s reliance on Biden-era financial policy. They specifically cited the U.S. President’s Working Group on Financial Markets report from the previous administration to support their position. This creates an intriguing international dialogue about how different countries approach cryptocurrency regulation. How Do Bank-Led Stablecoins Differ from Current Models? Traditional stablecoins typically come from cryptocurrency companies or fintech startups. However, bank-led stablecoins would operate differently in several key ways: Enhanced regulatory oversight through existing banking frameworks Built-in consumer protections that banks already provide Seamless integration with traditional financial systems Proven risk management practices from established institutions Greater financial stability through centralized oversight This model addresses many concerns that regulators have about privately-issued stablecoins, including reserve transparency and systemic risk. What Challenges Might Bank-Led Stablecoins Face? While the bank-led stablecoins approach offers significant benefits, it also faces several hurdles. Traditional banks may struggle with the technological innovation required for digital currency systems. Additionally, there are concerns about whether banks can move quickly enough to compete with agile crypto startups. Another challenge involves international coordination. Since cryptocurrencies operate across borders, different regulatory approaches could create friction in global markets. The Bank of Korea’s proposal highlights how countries are taking varied paths toward regulating digital assets. What Does This Mean for Crypto Investors and Users? The push for bank-led stablecoins represents a significant shift in how governments view digital currencies. For users, this could mean: More stable and reliable digital payment options Better consumer protection mechanisms Easier integration between crypto and traditional banking Increased regulatory clarity for digital assets This development suggests that major financial institutions are taking cryptocurrencies seriously and want to play a central role in their evolution. How Might This Impact Global Crypto Regulation? The Bank of Korea’s position on bank-led stablecoins could influence other countries considering their own digital currency frameworks. As one of Asia’s leading economies, South Korea’s regulatory approach often sets precedents for neighboring nations. Moreover, the reference to U.S. policy shows how international regulatory discussions are shaping local decisions. This creates an interesting dynamic where countries learn from each other’s experiences with cryptocurrency regulation. Conclusion: The Future of Stablecoins Is Evolving The Bank of Korea’s advocacy for bank-led stablecoins marks a pivotal moment in cryptocurrency history. By leveraging Biden-era financial policy while adapting it to local needs, they’re creating a hybrid approach that balances innovation with stability. This could become a model for other nations seeking to regulate digital assets without stifling their potential. As the debate continues between bank-centric and open models, one thing is clear: stablecoins are becoming too important to leave unregulated. The question isn’t whether they’ll be regulated, but how—and the Bank of Korea has just made a powerful case for their preferred approach. Frequently Asked Questions What are bank-led stablecoins? Bank-led stablecoins are digital currencies issued and managed by traditional banking institutions rather than cryptocurrency companies or fintech startups. Why does the Bank of Korea prefer bank-led stablecoins? The Bank of Korea believes banks offer better consumer protection, regulatory oversight, and financial stability compared to non-bank issuers. How does this differ from U.S. policy? Current U.S. policy under the Trump administration allows non-bank entities to issue stablecoins, while the Bank of Korea wants to restrict issuance to banks. What policy did the Bank of Korea reference? They cited the U.S. President’s Working Group on Financial Markets report from the Biden administration that recommended bank-centric approaches. When might we see bank-led stablecoins in South Korea? There’s no specific timeline yet, but the white paper suggests the Bank of Korea is seriously considering this regulatory framework. Will this affect existing stablecoins? Existing stablecoins might need to adapt to new regulations or partner with banks if the Bank of Korea’s proposal becomes law. Found this analysis insightful?

Smart buyers are strongly pursuing transparency and sustainable growth models. Recent news surrounding Solana’s (SOL) price target and Hyperliquid’s (HYPE) price prediction have created strong optimism for the best crypto to buy right now moving into 2026. Solana’s ETF launch and Hyperliquid’s buyback momentum are securing institutional confidence even amidst volatile market conditions. Amid these significant developments, BlockDAG (BDAG) has become the main focus. Its presale is currently in Batch 32, priced at $0.005. Special price in batch 32, and has already secured $435M+ raised. Under its new Value Era framework, the project is changing its entire coin distribution model. Solana: The $210 Target Fueled by Institutional ETF Inflows Solana has maintained impressive growth following the announcement of the Bitwise Solana Staking ETF debut on the New York Stock Exchange. Analysts believe this development could push Solana’s (SOL) price target toward $210 very soon. This is supported by solid institutional money flowing in and active community demand. As one of the most bullish assets, Solana remains a focal point for those seeking exposure to high-speed blockchain networks. SOL currently trades near $202. Its market cap is over $111 billion, and its 24-hour volume exceeds $14 billion. These numbers show accelerating market engagement. Analysts note a bullish technical setup. This is supported by the MACD and RSI indicators, which signal a strong footing above the $190 price range. While Solana’s immediate outlook is very promising, a comparison with newer ecosystems like BlockDAG and Hyperliquid highlights a growing preference for sustainable, scarcity-driven growth models. Hyperliquid: Buyback Program Anchors Market Stability Hyperliquid’s (HYPE) price prediction holds steady near $48. This follows a volatile trading week. Despite market tension, sentiment remains positive. This is thanks to Hyperliquid’s reliable fee revenue and its ongoing $644 million buyback program. This program aims to reduce the circulating coin supply. This strategic approach has strengthened HYPE’s position as one of the best crypto to buy right now in the decentralized derivatives sector. The recent HIP-3 upgrade has boosted on-chain utility. It allows developers to launch perpetual markets through staking 500,000 HYPE. Data from DeFiLlama reports over $111 million in monthly fees and $98.9 million in holder revenue. This reflects strong network performance. Technically, Hyperliquid’s (HYPE) price prediction shows a neutral-to-bullish trend. The RSI is near 58, and the Bollinger Bands are tightening. This suggests a potential breakout above $48 toward the $52 resistance zone. BlockDAG’s Value Era Show Structure & Scarcity BlockDAG’s Value Era marks a decisive shift toward mainnet activation and exchange readiness. The price is $0.005. Special price in batch 32. It has successfully secured $435M+ raised. The project has moved away from bonuses toward a fully transparent, vesting-based model. Each purchase now releases 40% of coins immediately. The remaining 60% is distributed evenly over three months. This structure dramatically improves credibility. It supports liquidity and shows a long-term approach that appeals to serious buyers. CEO Anthony Turner confirmed that 4.3B coins remaining are allocated for this final presale stage. This is supported by an $86 million institutional commitment. The Presale is ending soon. This fixed timeline creates predictability and accountability in a market often defined by uncertainty. A massive 75% reduction in earlier bonus coins has capped the presale supply at 50 billion coins. This strongly reinforces a scarcity-based model. This disciplined structure gives BlockDAG a measurable advantage in maturity and transparency. For those tracking Hyperliquid’s and Solana’s progress, BlockDAG’s Value Era stands apart as a benchmark of stability and institutional confidence. Final Thoughts While Solana (SOL) and Hyperliquid (HYPE) are attracting attention through ETF momentum and buyback plans, they still rely on short-term market sentiment. Their growth outlook is strong, but volatility and regulatory uncertainty remain. In sharp contrast, BlockDAG’s Value Era represents strategic clarity. For $0.005 Special price in batch 32 with $435M+ raised, the project is anchored in transparency and fairness. Its vesting plan and reduced coin supply establish it as the best crypto to buy right now for 2026 and beyond. This is a project built to withstand market cycles while offering long-term value to smart traders.

Recent analysis reveals a dramatic transformation that every crypto investor should understand. The Ethereum market has undergone a fundamental shift from its traditional spot-driven structure to becoming highly speculative, creating new challenges and opportunities for traders. What Exactly Changed in the Ethereum Market? CryptoQuant contributor Darkfost’s analysis shows the Ethereum market has completely transformed its trading dynamics. Previously, Ethereum trading was dominated by spot market activity, which created more stable and sustainable bull runs. However, the current environment prioritizes quick profits over long-term stability. This shift matters because it affects everyone involved in the Ethereum market. The change impacts price stability, investment strategies, and risk management approaches for both retail and institutional participants. How Speculative Has the Ethereum Market Become? The data reveals astonishing growth in speculative activity. Current open interest and trading volumes for ETH have reached unprecedented levels that dwarf previous cycles. Consider these eye-opening statistics: Binance’s ETH trading volume surpassed $6 trillion this year alone This represents a two to threefold increase from the previous year Binance’s ETH open interest exceeded $12.5 billion as of August This is approximately five times higher than the previous all-time high of $2.5 billion set in November 2021 Why Does This Ethereum Market Shift Matter to You? The increased speculation in the Ethereum market creates both risks and opportunities. Higher volatility means potentially larger gains but also greater losses. The shift from spot-driven to speculative trading indicates changing market psychology where quick profits dominate investment decisions. This transformation affects how you should approach the Ethereum market. Traditional buy-and-hold strategies might need adjustment, while risk management becomes increasingly crucial in this new environment. What Can We Learn From This Ethereum Market Analysis? The data clearly indicates that the current Ethereum market cycle operates differently from previous ones. The exceptional speculation and increased volatility require investors to adapt their strategies. Understanding these market structure changes helps you make more informed decisions about your Ethereum investments. Moreover, recognizing these patterns in the Ethereum market can help you anticipate potential price movements and manage your exposure more effectively during both bullish and bearish phases. Navigating the New Ethereum Market Reality The Ethereum market’s transformation from spot-driven to highly speculative represents a significant evolution in cryptocurrency trading. While this brings new opportunities for profit, it also introduces increased risks that require careful navigation. Successful participation in today’s Ethereum market demands awareness of these structural changes and adaptation to the new trading environment. By understanding these dynamics, you can better position yourself for whatever comes next in this rapidly evolving space. Frequently Asked Questions What does ‘spot-driven market’ mean for Ethereum? A spot-driven Ethereum market means trading is primarily based on actual cryptocurrency purchases and sales rather than derivatives or leverage. This typically creates more stable and sustainable price movements. How does speculative trading affect Ethereum prices? Speculative trading increases volatility in the Ethereum market, leading to larger price swings in both directions. This can create opportunities for quick profits but also increases risk for investors. What is open interest in cryptocurrency trading? Open interest represents the total number of outstanding derivative contracts, such as futures and options, that haven’t been settled. High open interest often indicates increased speculative activity in the Ethereum market. Should I change my Ethereum investment strategy? While every investor’s situation differs, the increased speculation in the Ethereum market suggests reviewing your risk management strategies and considering whether your current approach aligns with the new market dynamics. How reliable is this Ethereum market analysis? The analysis comes from CryptoQuant, a reputable on-chain analytics platform, using verifiable trading data from major exchanges like Binance, making it a credible assessment of current Ethereum market conditions. Will the Ethereum market return to spot-driven trading? Market structures evolve continuously. While the current Ethereum market shows high speculation, future developments in regulation, technology, or investor behavior could shift the balance back toward spot trading dominance.

Network upgrades are essential maintenance procedures that enhance: Security features and protocol improvements Transaction speed and network efficiency Overall system stability and performance Therefore, exchanges like Upbit must temporarily pause services to ensure a smooth transition and protect user assets during the upgrade process. What Exactly Does This Suspension Mean for You? During the Upbit AVAX suspension period, users cannot perform several key functions. Understanding these limitations helps you plan accordingly and avoid unexpected disruptions to your trading strategy. Deposits halted : You cannot transfer AVAX into your Upbit wallet Withdrawals paused : Moving AVAX out of Upbit becomes impossible Trading continues : Importantly, AVAX trading pairs remain active Other assets unaffected : Only AVAX services experience interruption How Long Will This Upbit AVAX Suspension Last? Upbit has not specified an exact end date for the Upbit AVAX suspension , which is common practice during network upgrades. The duration typically depends on how quickly the Avalanche development team completes the upgrade and when exchanges can safely resume operations. However, based on historical patterns, such suspensions usually last between 2-12 hours. Upbit will announce the resumption of services through their official channels once they confirm network stability. What Should You Do Before the Suspension Starts? Smart traders prepare in advance. Here are actionable steps to take before the Upbit AVAX suspension begins at 9:00 a.m. UTC on July 19: Complete any pending AVAX transfers immediately Plan your trading strategy around the suspension window Monitor Upbit’s official announcements for updates Consider setting price alerts for AVAX during this period Diversify your trading activities to other unaffected assets Is This Upbit AVAX Suspension Cause for Concern? Absolutely not. Temporary suspensions for network upgrades demonstrate Upbit’s commitment to security and operational excellence. The Upbit AVAX suspension follows standard industry practices that prioritize user asset protection above all else. Moreover, such upgrades typically bring valuable improvements that benefit the entire Avalanche ecosystem in the long run. The temporary inconvenience leads to enhanced network performance and security for all users. Key Takeaways from the Upbit Announcement The Upbit AVAX suspension represents a routine maintenance procedure rather than an emergency situation. Remember these crucial points: This is a planned, temporary measure for network improvement Only AVAX deposits and withdrawals are affected Trading of AVAX pairs continues uninterrupted The suspension begins July 19 at 9:00 a.m. UTC Normal operations resume after upgrade completion Network upgrades, while temporarily disruptive, ultimately strengthen the cryptocurrency ecosystem.

Only deposits and withdrawals are temporarily paused. Will my existing AVAX holdings be safe during the upgrade? Absolutely. Your AVAX assets remain secure in your Upbit wallet.

Upbit will make an official announcement through their website and social media channels once services resume. Enable notifications to stay updated. Can I use other exchanges for AVAX during this time? Yes, other exchanges supporting Avalanche will continue normal operations unless they announce their own maintenance schedules. Why don’t exchanges schedule these during low-traffic hours?

54220596,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=856545,1762743106,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/54220596.jpeg,South Korea's FSC is finalizing a bill to oversee stablecoin regulation,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/south-korea-races-to-finalize-stablecoin-rules/,"South Korea said it is close to finalizing its long-awaited stablecoin legislation, as the central bank and financial regulator jostle over who should police digital tokens pegged to the won. The Financial Services Commission (FSC) plans to submit a government sponsored bill by the end of 2025. It will join five other competing stablecoin bills under review in the National Assembly which have been submitted by individual lawmakers. Meanwhile, the Bank of Korea (BOK), which released a stablecoin whitepaper on October 27, stressed that “currency functions on trust rather than technology,” and is also seeking a role in licensing and monitoring. Legislative chaos Competing proposals have muddled the stablecoin policy landscape. “Most of the bills in the National Assembly envision a licensing regime for private stablecoin issuers,” said Sejin Kim, a fintech policy analyst at the Information Technology and Innovation Foundation. “The central bank, on the other hand, wants to keep issuance in the hands of banks over concerns about financial stability.” The FSC views stablecoins as part of the virtual asset market and maintains that licensing, exchange oversight, and custody supervision should remain within its jurisdiction. While all the bills share the same overarching objective none of them fully align with either the FSC’s or the BOK’s preferred model, explained J eonghwan JK Kim, an attorney specializing in digital assets at Architect Legal Advisory. The kimchi premium spreads to stablecoins The newly elected President Jae-Myung Lee expressed concerns that South Koreans are too reliant on USD backed assets. USD pegged stablecoins USDC and USDT dominate Korea’s crypto market. According to the BOK, the total trading volume of USD pegged stablecoins reached 56.95 trillion won ($41.6 billion) in the first quarter of 2025, marking a threefold increase from 17.06 trillion won in the third quarter of 2024. But Korean investors are paying more for USDT and USDC than investors abroad. The price gap, referred to as the “kimchi premium,” stems from high user demand and capital restrictions that make it harder for traders to move money in and out of the country. The price hike was initially observed in the 2017 Bitcoin bull run where prices soared as high as 30% and has now spread to stablecoins. Pro-crypto president President Lee pledged to transform the country into a digital asset hub. His election campaign included proposals to establish a Korean won pegged stablecoin market, and allow domestic companies to issue stablecoins. Sejin Kim believes the stablecoin debate has the wrong priorities. She said the FSC and BOK are too focused on licensing authority and the idea that stablecoins are the key to unlocking new growth industries. She stressed that stablecoins work as a high volume settlement system with razor thin profit margins. The success of Korea’s stablecoin ecosystem depends on how distribution costs are managed and whether surrounding industries grow around it. “Licensing follows after the design principles are formed,” she said. “For a won pegged stablecoin to function in Korea’s real economy, it must be designed alongside actual use cases such as spot ETFs, tokenized securities (STO), international remittances, and cross-border B2B settlement. ETFs act as the investment pipe. Stablecoins act as the settlement pipe. Korea can only capture global capital flows if both pipes move together.” Central bank caution The BOK insists that the issuance of won stablecoins should be bank-led. In its stablecoin whitepaper , the BOK outlined several risk factors, such as depegging where the coin loses its one-on-one value with fiat currency, mass redemptions, as well as foreign exchange violations and capital flight. BOK Governor Chang-yong Rhee said that the issuance of won pegged stablecoin could act as a bypass for foreign exchange regulations, potentially increasing capital outflow and exchange rate volatility. Jaewon Choi, professor of finance at Seoul National University, agrees with the BOK’s measured approach. While USD stablecoins are traded at high volumes in Korea, he is uncertain whether a won-denominated stablecoin will gain traction. “I think the Bank of Korea’s concerns are legitimate. Of course, we can’t predict whether a stablecoin will collapse until it happens. But given that the most liquid USD stablecoins have a risk of depegging, it is not surprising that the BOK suspects that won denominated stablecoins carry the same risk.” Sejin Kim, fintech policy analyst at the Information Technology and Innovation Foundation stressed that the Korean won cannot be compared to the dominant USD stablecoins. “The won does not have the same global liquidity profile, so Korea needs to carefully evaluate the economic effects of introducing won pegged stablecoins at scale.” Jeonghwan JK Kim of Architect Legal Advisory said Korea’s regulatory philosophy remains rooted in a “positive-list” model, where only activities explicitly approved by authorities are allowed. “Initial coin offerings are a prime example of this because they are not formally banned, but they have never launched in practice because of regulatory pressure,” he said. It’s a legacy that makes it difficult for Korea to adopt a market-driven, innovation-first framework like the U.S. Genius Act. Two issuers, one coin Korean won pegged stablecoin issuers are waiting in the wings for legislation to be finalized. Blockchain developer IQ AI and Frax Finance announced the launch of the KRWX stablecoin on October 30. The coin was built for multi-blockchain and cross-border use. It is still at the proof-of-concept stage and not yet available to South Korean residents KRW1 , launched by Busan Digital Asset Custody Services in September, is officially South Korea’s first stablecoin. It was designed around Korea’s regulations and with institutional transactions in mind. In particular, cross-border remittances, emergency aid distribution, and institutional finance applications. The token remains in pilot mode until national stablecoins rules are finalized. Control versus innovation South Korea is leaning towards splitting duties, with the central bank managing reserves and settlement, and the FSC oversees licensing and exchanges, said Jeonghwan JK Kim. “It’s not yet a formal agreement, but the bills assume some form of shared responsibility.” He said it’s likely that the first stablecoins will come from bank-led consortia rather than tech startups. “Both regulators share a common recognition that stablecoins should be introduced gradually and should function as a safe, institutionally anchored asset.” This kind of a model would make Korea’s version of stablecoins less experimental but more durable.

Here’s the Significance,https://timestabloid.com/xrp-death-cross-incoming-heres-the-significance/,"A new technical pattern on XRP’s daily chart has become a focal point in the crypto market after Coin Bureau shared an analysis highlighting an approaching Death Cross on the XRP chart. The chart shows the 50-day Simple Moving Average (SMA) nearing a crossover below the 200-day SMA. Although there is notable recovery right now, t raders see this formation as a bearish indicator that could signal continued downward pressure in the near term. The chart illustrates XRP trading around the $2.17 level, while the shorter-term 50-day SMA (blue line) trends downward toward the longer-term 200-day SMA (red line). A yellow circle on the chart marks the imminent point of crossover. ALERT: XRP DEATH CROSS INCOMING! The 50 day SMA is about to cross the 200 day SMA. This is considered bearish and is termed a ""Death Cross"". pic.twitter.com/3Pa3VsWvNX — Coin Bureau (@coinbureau) November 7, 2025 Understanding the Death Cross The Death Cross occurs when a shorter-term moving average, such as the 50-day SMA, crosses below a longer-term average, typically the 200-day SMA. This pattern suggests that short-term momentum has weakened relative to the long-term trend, often interpreted by traders as a sign that selling pressure could dominate. Historically, the Death Cross has preceded market downturns in various asset classes, though its predictive accuracy is often debated among analysts. In XRP’s case, the crossover comes after a series of lower highs and declining daily closes that began after resistance near the $2.7 region. The 50-day SMA, which tracks more recent price action, has been declining since mid-October, reflecting persistent weakness. Meanwhile, the 200-day SMA has maintained a slower downward slope, reflecting the broader trend that has been in place for several months. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Where is XRP Going Next? Coin Bureau has been tracking this death cross for some time, and the chart indicates that XRP has already fallen almost 30% from its October highs, with bears maintaining control of short-term market momentum. The current setup reinforces what many traders view as a continuation of the correction phase that began after a failed breakout attempt earlier in the quarter. While Coin Bureau did not provide a price target or extended commentary in the post, the chart’s structure implies caution for those anticipating an immediate reversal. The Death Cross alone does not guarantee further losses, but it serves as a warning signal. Other analysts have predicted a continued downturn for XRP , as the broader crypto market also faces bearish pressure. Until a reversal pattern forms, the digital asset will likely continue this decline, potentially testing crucial support around $2.

The Senate on Sunday advanced a 60-vote cloture deal to reopen the federal government, sending the package to the House and President Trump for approval. The agreement funds operations through Jan. 30, 2026, reverses certain employee firings, secures SNAP benefits through fiscal 2026 and sets up a December vote on Affordable Care Act subsidies. Relief over a near-term resolution fed risk appetite, and traders rotated into higher beta assets. Nasdaq futures rose 0.8% and S&P 500 futures gained 0.5% in early trade, signaling a firmer Wall Street open. Crypto reflected the swing in sentiment. After the early pop, Bitcoin last traded near $106,097, up 4.4% from 24 hours earlier.

South Korea’s Kospi advanced 2%, and in Europe, Euro Stoxx 50 and DAX futures gained 1.3% each. Bond markets signaled a modest unwind of safety trades. The US 10-year yield edged up to about 4.13%, while the two-year rose to roughly 3.59%. The dollar recovered part of last week’s pullback as investors reassessed the growth outlook against a patient Federal Reserve. Inside Washington, the prolonged shutdown has strained the economy. Federal workers across airports, law enforcement and the military have gone unpaid, and the central bank has faced data gaps with limited government reporting. NEW: U.S. GOVERNMENT SHUTDOWN PREDICTED TO END NOV. 14 ON @Polymarket , AS AXIOS REPORTS AT LEAST 10 SENATE DEMOCRATS WILL BACK PROCEDURAL MOTION FOR SPENDING BILLS AND SHORT-TERM FUNDING THROUGH JANUARY SOURCE: https://t.co/niBILMkqxl pic.twitter.com/rNHNAenYqn — DEGEN NEWS (@DegenerateNews) November 9, 2025 Shutdown Fallout Weighs On Confidence, Keeping Investors Cautious White House economic adviser Kevin Hassett said fourth-quarter GDP could turn negative if the shutdown persisted. Consumer nerves showed up in the data. US consumer sentiment fell to near a three-and-a-half-year low in early November as households weighed the potential fallout, adding another layer of uncertainty to trading desks. For crypto, the path to a deal matters. The shutdown had tightened liquidity across pockets of the market and increased volatility around macro releases, so clearer fiscal footing lowers tail risks and supports positioning in digital assets sensitive to growth and risk cycles. Wall Street Eyes Shutdown Vote After Turbulent Week For Tech Stocks Equity investors kept one eye on last week’s shakeout. Concerns over stretched valuations in AI-linked names sparked the Nasdaq Composite’s worst week since April’s tariff-driven selloff, with the index down 3%. The S&P 500 fell 1.6% and the Dow slipped 1.2% for the week. Fed speakers last week signaled a preference to go slow on further rate cuts, and recent employment readings hinted at softening momentum. Traders, balancing those signals with the shutdown news, leaned toward a constructive start to the week. As the House takes up the Senate package and the White House reviews it, markets will watch the timeline closely. A clean passage keeps the relief bid intact, while any snag could revive volatility across both stocks and crypto.

The price is trading above $3,500 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. There was a break above a bearish trend line with resistance at $3,350 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD (data feed via Kraken). The pair could continue to move up if it clears the $3,720 zone. Ethereum Price Attempts Recovery Ethereum price managed to stay above $3,200 and started a recovery wave, like Bitcoin . ETH price was able to climb above the $3,350 and $3,400 resistance levels. There was a break above a bearish trend line with resistance at $3,350 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD. The pair surpassed the 50% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $3,920 swing high to the $3,058 low. The upward move was such that the price spiked above $3,620. Ethereum price is now trading above $3,550 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. If there is another recovery wave, the price could face resistance near the $3,650 level. The next key resistance is near the $3,720 level and the 76.4% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $3,920 swing high to the $3,058 low. The first major resistance is near the $3,750 level. A clear move above the $3,750 resistance might send the price toward the $3,820 resistance. An upside break above the $3,820 region might call for more gains in the coming days. In the stated case, Ether could rise toward the $3,880 resistance zone or even $3,925 in the near term. Another Decline In ETH? If Ethereum fails to clear the $3,650 resistance, it could start a fresh decline. Initial support on the downside is near the $3,580 level. The first major support sits near the $3,500 zone. A clear move below the $3,500 support might push the price toward the $3,450 support. Any more losses might send the price toward the $3,350 region in the near term. The next key support sits at $3,250 and $3,220.

This shocking reality unfolded as crypto futures liquidated at an alarming rate, with short traders bearing the brutal brunt of the market movement. The perpetual futures market experienced one of its most dramatic sessions recently, leaving traders reeling from massive losses. What Exactly Happened With These Crypto Futures Liquidations? The cryptocurrency derivatives market witnessed a perfect storm that triggered widespread liquidations. When we say crypto futures liquidated, we’re referring to the forced closure of leveraged positions when traders can’t meet margin requirements. This recent episode saw an overwhelming majority of these forced closures hitting traders who had bet against the market. Let’s break down the staggering numbers: Bitcoin liquidations totaled $115 million Short positions accounted for 91.35% of BTC liquidations Ethereum saw $91.42 million in liquidations 86.27% of ETH liquidations were short positions Zcash experienced $14.47 million in liquidations Why Did Short Traders Get Hit So Hard? The massive wave of crypto futures liquidated primarily affected short sellers because of unexpected price movements. When markets move against short positions, these traders face immediate margin calls. Many were caught off guard by sudden price increases, forcing exchanges to automatically close their positions. This domino effect creates what traders call a ‘short squeeze.’ As prices rise, short positions get liquidated, which then fuels further buying pressure. Consequently, more crypto futures liquidated in a cascading effect that amplified the market movement. How Does This Impact the Broader Crypto Market? When significant amounts of crypto futures liquidated occur, the entire market feels the ripple effects. These massive liquidations can create increased volatility and affect market sentiment. However, they also help reset leveraged positions, potentially creating healthier market conditions afterward. Traders should note that periods of heavy liquidation often precede calmer market conditions. The removal of excessive leverage typically reduces future volatility. Therefore, understanding these cycles becomes crucial for anyone involved in crypto derivatives trading. What Can Traders Learn From This Liquidation Event? The recent $220 million liquidation event offers valuable lessons for crypto traders. First, proper risk management remains essential when trading leveraged products. Second, diversifying positions across different timeframes and assets can help mitigate liquidation risks. Key takeaways include: Always use stop-loss orders Maintain adequate margin buffers Monitor market conditions continuously Avoid over-leveraging during volatile periods Will We See More Crypto Futures Liquidated Soon? Market analysts suggest that while such massive liquidation events are dramatic, they’re not uncommon in crypto markets. The high volatility inherent in cryptocurrency trading means traders should always prepare for potential liquidation waves. However, the concentration of short positions in this particular event made it especially noteworthy. As the market continues to evolve, we may see different patterns emerge. What remains constant is the need for cautious trading practices and thorough market analysis. Frequently Asked Questions What causes crypto futures to get liquidated? Crypto futures get liquidated when traders cannot meet margin requirements, typically due to adverse price movements against their positions. How can I avoid getting liquidated? Use proper risk management, maintain sufficient margin, employ stop-loss orders, and avoid excessive leverage during volatile market conditions. Why were short positions hit harder in this event? Short positions suffered more because unexpected price increases triggered margin calls against traders betting on price declines. Do liquidation events affect spot prices? Yes, large liquidation events can create increased volatility and temporary price distortions in spot markets due to forced selling or buying. How often do major liquidation events occur? Significant liquidation events happen periodically, often coinciding with major market movements or unexpected news events. Can liquidation events create trading opportunities? Experienced traders sometimes use liquidation events to enter positions at potentially favorable prices once the volatility subsides. Found this analysis helpful?

Ethereum continues to drive the decentralized economy through its Layer-2 expansion, improving speed and scalability across millions of daily transactions. Hedera, on the other hand, is buzzing thanks to its enterprise-grade partnerships that push boundaries in data transparency and real-world integration. These giants are shaping how digital ecosystems evolve, setting the stage for new challengers ready to take a leap. Among these rising stars, MoonBull is making headlines with its MoonBull presale, now in Stage 6. The hype is real because it’s designed to deliver what every investor secretly craves – that rare 1000x crypto moment. With structured tokenomics and powerful community backing, MoonBull offers a presale opportunity that feels like catching lightning in a bottle – or rather, a bull in full charge. MoonBull ($MOBU): The 1000x Crypto Presale Changing the Game MoonBull’s presale feels like the crypto version of finding gold before the rush begins. It’s currently in Stage 6 at just $0.00008388, and the buzz is deafening. More than 1,900 holders have already jumped in, pushing the presale tally above $550K. Early backers are staring at a potential ROI of over 7244% from Stage 6 to the listing price of $0.00616 – the kind of return that turns peanuts into a feast. Here’s where it gets juicy: imagine investing $30,000 at this stage. When the listing hits, that could swell to over $2.17 million, setting up the kind of financial freedom meme coin dreams are made of. This isn’t empty hype – it’s structured through 23 smartly designed stages that steadily raise the price, ensuring scarcity and momentum at every turn. That’s why MoonBull is being touted as the 1000x crypto play of the year. Launch Plan: Built to Reward the Community MoonBull’s launch blueprint is another reason this project feels like the next 1000x crypto. After the final presale stage, liquidity is locked for 48 hours to stabilize price action, ensuring no dump drama. During the first hour of launch, selling requires a matching buy, meaning early holders won’t watch their gains vanish in thin air. The whole setup screams fairness and foresight. By deploying on Ethereum, MoonBull merges meme culture with DeFi stability. Its auto-liquidity injections, reflections, and burns work like a self-feeding bull engine – every transaction strengthens the system. From staking to governance, MoonBull transforms investors from mere spectators into participants shaping the project’s destiny. Ethereum: The Pioneer Still Leading the Charge Ethereum keeps proving why it’s the backbone of decentralized finance. With the 2025 rollout of enhanced Layer-2 scaling and Ethereum 2.0 validators topping 900,000, its transaction efficiency has gone from sluggish to slick. Developers and investors continue to favor it for its massive ecosystem of smart contracts, DEXs, and NFTs. It’s like the seasoned bull that’s still strong in the ring – tested, respected, and constantly improving. The platform’s focus on scalability and security has strengthened its position as the go-to network for innovation. Major projects rely on Ethereum’s backbone to launch dApps, DAOs, and token ecosystems. While newer blockchains are trying to bite into its market share, Ethereum remains untouchable due to its maturity, developer loyalty, and proven reliability. For investors chasing the next 1000x crypto, Ethereum’s evolution sets the tone for where innovation begins – and where MoonBull builds its foundation. Hedera: The Corporate-Grade Blockchain With a Twist Hedera’s 2025 momentum is driven by its unique Hashgraph consensus, which allows transactions at lightning speed with near-zero energy waste. It has partnered with global players like Google and IBM, showing the world that enterprise blockchain isn’t just a buzzword. With over 11 billion transactions processed and consistent network uptime, Hedera stands as the penguin in a crowd of bulls – calm, efficient, and quietly dominating its niche. What sets Hedera apart is its corporate council governance. Over 39 international organizations now help steer the platform, ensuring accountability and stability – something meme coin ecosystems can learn from. Yet even with its real-world adoption, Hedera’s growth still leaves room for agile projects like MoonBull to thrive. For those seeking the next 1000x crypto, Hedera’s stability contrasts perfectly with MoonBull’s daring, high-reward energy. Conclusion Based on the latest research and market trends, Ethereum continues to fortify its DeFi kingdom while Hedera advances enterprise-grade adoption with unmatched efficiency. Both ecosystems set the stage for innovation but lean toward long-term utility over viral growth. This leaves a wide gap in the market for bold meme tokens built on structure and substance – and that’s exactly where MoonBull, the potential 1000x crypto , charges in. MoonBull isn’t just another meme coin – it’s a movement. With its transparent MoonBull presale, 23 scarcity-driven stages, and tokenomics crafted for real reward, it’s pulling crypto enthusiasts back into the excitement of early adoption. The window fo r Stage 6 entry is closing fast, and every smart investor knows bulls don’t wait around.

Here’s Why,https://timestabloid.com/market-strategist-do-not-buy-xrp-anymore-heres-why/,"Steph Is Crypto (@Steph_iscrypto), a popular market analyst, has issued a firm warning to investors, saying that XRP could be entering another significant downturn if a key technical condition persists. His analysis centers on the 200-week simple moving average (SMA), a metric that has historically signaled major market shifts for the asset. Technical Indicator Raises Concern In a recent video, Steph explained that XRP’s position relative to the 200-week SMA is crucial. “Do not buy XRP if we see multiple weekly closes below the 200 weekly simple moving average here in the blue color,” he said, referring to the technical line that tracks long-term price trends. He pointed to two previous examples where similar signals preceded severe market declines . In 2018, when XRP closed two consecutive weekly candles below the 200-week SMA, it entered a sharp bear market that pushed its price down by approximately 81.13%. The same pattern repeated in 2021, leading to another 66.06% drop. Steph Is Crypto noted that XRP has once again fallen below this level, suggesting that history could repeat itself if the token remains there for an extended period. Do Not Buy #XRP Anymore… pic.twitter.com/6ADLtEbk62 — STEPH IS CRYPTO (@Steph_iscrypto) November 7, 2025 Potential Downside Projections With XRP currently trading around $2.3, applying those historical declines gives a sobering perspective. An 81.13% decline from current levels would bring the asset down to $0.43, while a 66.06% drop would put it near $0.78. These figures are hypothetical but grounded in past reactions to similar technical breakdowns. The analyst emphasized that traders should “watch this very closely,” as sustained weakness below the 200-week SMA may confirm a bearish phase similar to prior cycles. For investors relying heavily on technical indicators, such a move could be interpreted as a sign to stay out of the market until a clear recovery is visible above that key threshold. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Short-Term Strength Could Offer Relief Despite these warnings, XRP’s recent performance shows some encouraging signs. The asset has climbed by almost 4% in the past 24 hours, indicating that buyers are still active and willing to support the price at current levels. This short-term momentum could provide temporary relief if sustained buying pressure lifts XRP further. Technical trends can change quickly, and a continued climb could invalidate the bearish outlook and shift sentiment once again. Until then, Steph’s advice is that traders monitor weekly closes to see if XRP follows its historical pattern or breaks from it before making new investment decisions.

(Nov. 10),https://invezz.com/news/2025/11/10/why-is-the-crypto-market-going-up-today-nov-10/,"The crypto market rally gained steam on Monday morning, with the total valuation of all tokens jumping by nearly 5% to $4.57 trillion. Bitcoin remained above $105,000, while top coins like PUMP, Virtuals Protocol, Zcash, and Aerodrome Finance were up by over 15%. Crypto market rally happening as government shutdown nears end The main reason why the government shutdown is happening is that the longest government shutdown is nearing its end after some moderate senators reached a deal on Sunday. The proposed deal seems like a victory to Donald Trump and the Republicans, who have largely achieved most things they wanted, such as ending Obamacare subsidies. Democrats main victory was a commitment for no federal employees layoffs through January next year. Ending the government shutdown is a good thing for the crypto market as it removes one of the biggest risks in the market. It also means that the US will start releasing key macro data on areas like the labor market and inflation soon. These numbers are important as they help to complement those published by the private sector, which the Federal Reserve and other economists have been relying on in the past few months. Crypto market going up as SOFR rate slips Another key reason why the crypto market rally is happening is that the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (SOFR) has continued moving downwards, and is now at the lowest level in years. The SOFR is an important interest rate that companies like banks pay for overnight financing. It is collateralized by the US treasury in the repurchase or repo market. Analysts believe that the SOFR rate is often more important than the headline interest rate that the Fed cuts or raises. A falling SOFR rate boosts the stock and crypto markets by lowering the cost of borrowing, which leads to a risk-on sentiment among investors. SOFR rate has fallen recently | Source: Fred Demand for privacy tokens rising The other main catalyst for the ongoing crypto market rally is happening is that demand for privacy tokens is soaring . Data compiled by CoinMarketCap shows that privacy tokens are leading the ongoing surge in the crypto market industry. Zcash price has jumped from below $50 in October to $650 today, making it the 12th biggest token in the crypto industry. Dash price jumped by 14% in the last 24 hours, while other tokens like Monero, Horizen, and Decred have maintained their bull run. Rising volume and open interest The crypto market rally is also happening as volume and futures open interest gains steam. Data shows that open interest in the crypto industry jumped by 5.22% in the last 24 hours to $148 billion, a sign that investors are starting to deploy leverage into the industry. There are signs that the funding rate has bottomed after plunging sharply last month when over 1.6 million traders were liquidated. The volume in the spot market has also jumped in to past few days, moving to $270 billion in the last 24 hours. Upcoming crypto earnings The crypto market rally is happening ahead of the upcoming earnings by some of the biggest companies in the crypto industry. Gemini Space Station, the crypto exchange backed by the Winklevoss Twins, will be the first crypto exchange to publish it numbers this week. The other top companies to watch will be TeraWulf and Circle. TeraWulf is a $5 billion company that mines Bitcoin and is now pivoting to the AI data center space. Circle, on the other hand, is the company behind USDC, the second-biggest company in the stablecoin industry after Tether. The post Why is the crypto market going up today?

The newly passed temporary budget bill provides essential government funding through January, ensuring continuous operation of federal agencies and services. This stopgap measure passed with a solid 60-40 vote margin, demonstrating bipartisan support for keeping the government functioning. Following the bill’s approval, President Donald Trump expressed optimism about the shutdown ending soon. The temporary budget bill represents a practical solution that allows more time for comprehensive budget negotiations while preventing immediate disruption to government services. Why Was This Temporary Budget Bill Necessary? Government shutdowns create widespread consequences that affect: Federal employee pay and benefits Essential public services National park operations Economic stability and market confidence The temporary budget bill serves as a bridge solution, providing lawmakers additional time to reach consensus on longer-term funding arrangements. This approach prevents the damaging effects of a full government shutdown while maintaining critical operations. How Does the Political Process Unfold From Here? With the temporary budget bill now passed, attention shifts to the House of Representatives and presidential approval. The legislative process requires both chambers to agree on identical versions before the bill reaches the President’s desk for signature. This temporary budget bill success follows reports of senators reaching partial agreements earlier in the week. The 60-40 vote margin indicates significant cross-party cooperation, suggesting growing consensus around the urgency of avoiding a government shutdown. What Are the Immediate Impacts of This Decision? The passage of this temporary budget bill brings several immediate benefits: Federal workers can continue their duties without interruption Government services remain accessible to citizens Economic uncertainty decreases International confidence in US stability strengthens Moreover, the temporary budget bill creates a stable environment for businesses and individuals who rely on consistent government operations. This stability is crucial for maintaining economic momentum and public confidence. Looking Ahead: What Comes After This Temporary Budget Bill? While this temporary budget bill resolves the immediate crisis, it sets the stage for more comprehensive budget negotiations in the coming months. Lawmakers now have until January to develop a longer-term funding solution that addresses broader fiscal priorities. The successful passage of this temporary budget bill demonstrates that bipartisan cooperation remains possible in challenging political environments. It serves as a model for future negotiations and highlights the importance of pragmatic solutions over ideological standoffs. Frequently Asked Questions What is a temporary budget bill? A temporary budget bill, often called a continuing resolution, provides short-term funding to keep government operations running when full-year budgets aren’t approved by the deadline. How long does this temporary budget bill last? This specific temporary budget bill funds the government through January, giving lawmakers several months to negotiate a more comprehensive budget agreement. What happens if a temporary budget bill isn’t passed? Without a temporary budget bill or full budget approval, the government would partially shut down, furloughing non-essential workers and suspending many services. Can the temporary budget bill be extended? Yes, temporary budget bills can be extended if lawmakers need additional time to reach agreement on longer-term funding solutions. What services continue during temporary budget periods? Essential services like national security, air traffic control, and law enforcement continue, while non-essential services may operate with reduced staffing. How does this affect federal employees? Federal employees continue working and receiving pay during temporary budget bill periods, avoiding the uncertainty of potential furloughs. Found this analysis helpful?

The company operates the Truth Social social media platform and saw revenues decline to $972,900 from over $1 million a year ago. Shares ended trading down 1.73% at $13.10 and rose slightly after hours to $13.20. Crypto Holdings and Strategy Trump Media held 11,542 Bitcoin as of September 30. The company first began buying Bitcoin in late July and has indicated plans to acquire more, alongside exploring other cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin holdings generated $15.3 million of realised income from options investments. Additionally, the company posted $33 million in unrealised gains from holding Cronos tokens. The company said it acquired Bitcoin as part of an investment strategy launched in May after raising $1.5 billion from stock sales and $1 billion from bonds. Expansion and Treasury Moves CEO Devin Nunes stated the quarter was crucial to Trump Media’s expansion plans. He said the company has “secured our financial future with a massive Bitcoin treasury, and expanded our existing platforms.” The company also formed Trump Media Group CRO Strategy, a digital asset treasury company aimed at buying up to $1 billion in Cronos tokens, representing over 6.3 trillion units. “With these financial assets now earning income, alongside our second consecutive quarter of positive operating cash flow, we’re well-poised to act on our mergers and acquisitions strategy,” Nunes said. Financial Assets and Stock Challenges Trump Media’s financial assets grew from $274 million in March 2024 to $3.1 billion as of September 30. Despite this, the company’s stock has struggled, losing 61% year-to-date.

In a recent interview with the South China Morning Post , Winters praised the city’s forward-thinking regulatory approach, saying its openness to experimentation has created an ideal environment for developing blockchain solutions that can transform financial services. He pointed to the Hong Kong Monetary Authority’s (HKMA) pilot programmes on tokenized deposits, wholesale central bank digital currencies and stablecoins as examples of how regulators are enabling innovation without compromising safety. “We’re going to remain ahead on digital technology, and what we lose in margin, we’re going to make up in volume by providing a better service to our customers,” Winters said. Hong Kong Deepens Fintech Ambitions With Fintech 2030 Hong Kong’s push to become a global hub for digital finance gained fresh momentum last week. The Hong Kong Monetary Authority launched its five-year “Fintech 2030” strategy to accelerate innovation across the city’s financial system. The plan focuses on four pillars (data and payments, artificial intelligence, resilience and tokenization) together forming the DART framework. This roadmap will guide the next wave of Hong Kong’s fintech growth. In addition, the initiative includes more than 40 programmes aimed at integrating new technologies, strengthening cybersecurity and expanding financial inclusion. Collectively, these efforts could help the sector surpass $600b in revenue by 2032. Hong Kong will allow licensed crypto exchanges to connect with global order books, ending its current isolated trading model. #HongKong #Crypto https://t.co/f8Lj9NKxoR — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) November 3, 2025 Regulators are also easing constraints on digital asset trading. Securities and Futures Commission (SFC) Chief Executive Julia Leung said licensed crypto exchanges in Hong Kong will soon be allowed to link with global order books , enabling local platforms to tap into broader liquidity and attract more institutional players. Standard Chartered Builds Momentum In Capital-Light, High-Return Digital Segments Standard Chartered has played an active role in the HKMA’s regulatory sandboxes, where new blockchain applications are tested in controlled settings. Winters said blockchain technology could lower transaction costs and improve efficiency across financial services. “Ultimately, people will prioritise moving money securely, efficiently and cheaply,” he said. “Financial markets always find a way.” He added that the bank would continue to strengthen compliance with anti-money-laundering and fraud-prevention rules as it scales digital operations. Growth In High-Return Segments Lifts Standard Chartered’s Quarterly Earnings Standard Chartered’s commitment to digital finance is already paying off. In the third quarter, the bank’s net profit rose 10% to $1.03b, beating analyst expectations. The performance was driven by growth in capital-light, high-return segments such as wealth management, cross-border payments and digital finance. “Those areas are less capital-intensive, higher-returning and fast-growing, so we’re happy to keep deploying resources there,” Winters said. Hong Kong remains a key investment destination for Standard Chartered’s affluent and wealth management business across Asia, the Middle East and Africa. The bank plans to invest $1.5b in wealth management over the next five years. This move reinforces its long-term commitment to the region. For Bill Winters, Hong Kong’s growing regulatory clarity and strong institutional participation strengthen its appeal. Moreover, the city’s openness to blockchain innovation makes it central to Standard Chartered’s digital finance roadmap.

The clip features Trump speaking about how the country’s payment and money transfer systems remain “ decades out of date ,” and how new legislation would make the entire framework “eligible for a 21st century upgrade using the state-of-the-art crypto technology.” Trump’s comments struck a familiar chord within the XRP community. The statement about crypto-driven modernization came at a time when many digital asset advocates have emphasized the need for scalable blockchain systems capable of supporting global financial settlements. XRP supporters in particular view these remarks as aligning closely with the use cases long associated with Ripple’s XRP-powered payment solutions and technology. He basically said XRP without saying XRP pic.twitter.com/CytuHZdcCu — XRPee (@XRPee3) November 8, 2025 Interpretation of Trump’s Message In his response to Trump’s comments, XRPee told his audience that the president had effectively confirmed what many in the crypto space have been saying for years. “You can no longer deny the fact that the reset is happening in real time,” he said, adding that most Americans “have no clue” about the scale of the change taking place behind the scenes. He argued that Trump’s statement showed that cryptocurrencies will be the backbone of this transition , and he suggests that XRP and similar technologies could play a role in this shift, given their design for real-time, low-cost transactions. While Trump did not name any specific cryptocurrency, XRPee emphasized that his comments align with the direction Ripple and its ecosystem have pursued for over a decade. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 How XRP Fits into the Conversation The XRP Ledger has been positioned as a solution to inefficiencies Trump described. It enables near-instant cross-border settlements without relying on outdated intermediary networks. The idea that “payments and money transfers are costly and take days or even weeks to clear,” as Trump stated, mirrors the problem Ripple has long sought to solve through its use of blockchain technology. For years, Ripple executives and developers have described their system as an upgrade to the traditional infrastructure underpinning the global financial system. Although Trump’s statement was delivered in the context of a legislative proposal, it has resonated strongly among crypto enthusiasts who believe the financial reset is underway. While Trump never mentioned XRP directly, his acknowledgment of crypto technology as key to modernizing America’s financial system has been interpreted by many as a signal that the era of XRP integration and adoption may be closer than expected.

During the event, users who borrow USDT via HTX Margin or Collateral Swap (formerly Crypto Loans) will receive a rebate of up to 30% of the actual interest paid, based on cumulative borrowing volume. The specific rules are as follows: Borrow ≥10,000 USDT to receive a 10% rebate; Borrow ≥100,000 USDT to receive a 20% rebate; Borrow ≥1,000,000 USDT to win a 30% rebate.

In London, the BBC reels from a leadership shake-up after a Trump documentary scandal. Meanwhile, Beijing and Washington ease trade tensions with reciprocal port fee suspensions, and Bitcoin rockets past $106,000, signaling renewed confidence in crypto markets. A glance at the major developments this morning. Senate Democrats strike deal to end shutdown After 40 tense days of the longest government shutdown in US history, Senate Democrats finally struck a breakthrough deal on Sunday. In a 60–40 vote, the Senate agreed to move forward with a bipartisan plan to get most of the government back up and running through January 30, 2026. Eight Democrats crossed party lines to back the measure, bowing to growing frustration from the public over unpaid federal workers and airport chaos caused by the shutdown. The deal includes guaranteed back pay for federal employees and restores full SNAP benefits, but Democrats had to compromise on one key issue: immediate extensions to Affordable Care Act subsidies. Instead, they secured a promise for a future Senate vote on those health care provisions. The agreement now heads to the House, which still needs to approve it before the government officially reopens. BBC chief quits over Trump documentary scandal The BBC was thrown into chaos this weekend after both Director General Tim Davie and News CEO Deborah Turness resigned over a major controversy surrounding a Panorama documentary about former President Donald Trump. The program came under fire for allegedly editing together parts of Trump’s January 6 speech in a way that made it look like he directly urged his supporters to “fight like hell” and storm the Capitol, something critics say was misleading and unfair. The backlash was swift, sparking accusations of bias and deepening concerns about the BBC’s editorial standards. Davie said he took “ultimate responsibility” for what happened and that stepping down was his own decision. Turness, meanwhile, admitted the situation had become too damaging for the organization, saying accountability had to come first. Trump wasted no time responding, blasting the BBC as “corrupt journalists.” China, US pause port fees amid thaw China announced it’s suspending port fees on US-linked vessels for a full year starting November 10, 2025, a move that marks a rare moment of calm in the ongoing trade tensions between the two countries. According to the Chinese transport ministry, the decision comes as part of a reciprocal deal after the US agreed to pause its own retaliatory port fees on Chinese ships. It’s a small but meaningful step toward cooling things down in the maritime trade arena, where costs and delays have been piling up for months. The suspension is expected to give global shipping networks some breathing room by easing financial and logistical pressures. For shipping companies, it’s a welcome bit of relief. And for both Washington and Beijing, it’s a sign they’re at least trying to steer relations, and their shipbuilding industries, back into smoother waters. Bitcoin blazes past $106K as crypto markets rally Bitcoin has smashed through the $106,000 mark, setting a new record in what’s shaping up to be one of its most powerful rallies yet. The surge comes as big financial institutions and corporations continue jumping on board, with some even parking portions of their treasuries in Bitcoin, a sign that mainstream adoption is accelerating fast. Behind the rally, improvements to the Bitcoin network itself have made transactions more efficient and secure, adding to investor confidence. This latest high blows past previous records, climbing roughly 60% above the 2021 peak of around $65,000. Yes, Bitcoin is still volatile as it always has been, but the market’s tone feels different this time. Stronger network activity, clearer regulations, and a more mature ecosystem are giving investors reason to believe this isn’t just another short-term spike, but part of a longer, steadier climb.

Bloomberg reported Monday that the new set of “digitally native” bonds will be denominated in US dollars, Hong Kong dollars, euros and offshore yuan. Sources familiar with the move said that the deal could be priced as early as Monday. A digital bond is a type of security issued and managed using blockchain technology. The blockchain allows the bond’s details and ownership to be recorded securely and transparently on a digital ledger. The latest offering of digitally native bonds across multiple currencies can be issued on public blockchains like Ethereum or via DLT platforms offered by HSBC Holdings or Goldman Sachs. Hong Kong is marketing a new set of “digitally native” bonds denominated in multiple currencies, intensifying the city’s drive to become a global hub for digital assets https://t.co/uZjZ8bDhUh — Bloomberg (@business) November 10, 2025 Digital Bonds Gain Traction in Hong Kong Hong Kong’s latest move builds on the city’s established tokenized bond frameworks announced in 2024. The HKMA introduced its second tokenized green bond in 2023 , aiming to leverage blockchain for transparency in the redemption process. Besides, Hong Kong has solidified its position as Asia’s leading international bond issuance hub . It accounts for nearly 30% of Asian international bond issuances, topping the regional league table for nine years. The announcement to sell digital green bonds comes days after global asset manager Franklin Templeton launched Hong Kong’s first tokenized money-market fund. The fund uses blockchain to boost transparency and transaction efficiency and is initially open to institutional investors. Further, Hong Kong-based corporates issue at least six digital notes, Bloomberg noted. These notes have raised a total of $1 billion with four launching this year. Rain Yin, Director at S&P Global Ratings, said that the firm has given AA+ rating to the proposed digital notes. “Those are mitigated by a plan that requires, ultimately, shifting the notes to the traditional systems in case of disruption.” The post Hong Kong Launches ‘Digitally Native’ Bonds to Intensify Crypto Hub Ambitions appeared first on Cryptonews .",Blockchain News|Digital Assets|Hong Kong,EN,0,0,ASIA|BLOCKCHAIN|BUSINESS|ETH|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'cryptonews', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptonews.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptonews,2025-11-10 05:22:38

His bullish outlook was shared amid rising market uncertainty and recent analysis showing Bitcoin’s fundamentals hinting at a rebound. However, contrasting views from market analysts paint a more cautious picture, with whales and long-term holders offloading assets and driving persistent sell pressure, very similar to the post-dot-com crash era. Analysts suggest this consolidation phase could last up to another year. Kiyosaki Bets on Hard Assets Rich Dad Poor Dad author Robert Kiyosaki reinforced his bullish stance on hard assets by saying he’s buying more gold, silver, Bitcoin, and Ethereum as global markets brace for what he believes will be an inevitable financial crash. In a post that was shared on X on Sunday, Kiyosaki warned of an impending downturn but said he is preparing for it by accumulating assets he describes as “real money.” He also set ambitious price targets of $27,000 for gold, $100 for silver, and $250,000 for Bitcoin by 2026. Kiyosaki attributed his gold forecast to economist Jim Rickards, while his Bitcoin projection aligns with his long-standing belief that BTC serves as a hedge against what he calls the Federal Reserve’s “fake money.” The bestselling author also revealed that he is turning increasingly optimistic about Ethereum, thanks to Fundstrat’s Tom Lee, who views the blockchain as the foundation for stablecoins and a crucial infrastructure for global finance. Kiyosaki said his investment philosophy is rooted in Gresham’s Law — the idea that bad money drives out good — and Metcalfe’s Law, which links a network’s value to its number of users. In addition to this, the outspoken financial educator once again criticized the US Treasury and the Federal Reserve for excessive money printing, and accused them of turning the United States into the “biggest debtor nation in history.” After once again sharing his well-known mantra that “savers are losers,” Kiyosaki urged investors to buy tangible assets even during market corrections, and argued that the coming crisis will widen the gap between real and “fake” money. On-chain indicators may actually support Kiyosaki’s optimism. Data from analytics firm Crypto Crib shows that Bitcoin’s Market Value to Realised Value (MVRV) ratio returned to 1.8, which is a level that historically preceded big rebounds of 30% to 50%. Meanwhile, former BitMEX CEO Arthur Hayes predicted that the Federal Reserve will soon resort to “stealth quantitative easing” to manage the ballooning US debt. Hayes said this form of hidden liquidity injection through the Fed’s Standing Repo Facility will quietly boost asset prices, particularly Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. Crypto Faces Heavy Whale Selling On the other hand, crypto whales and long-term holders are cashing out and putting consistent selling pressure on the market, keeping prices subdued. This is according to analyst Jordi Visser . He compared the current state of the crypto market to the aftermath of the 2000s dot-com bubble, where tech stocks plunged by up to 80% and then spent more than a decade consolidating before recovering their highs. Visser explained that during that period, venture capitalists and insiders who invested in early-stage tech companies were locked into their positions due to investment restrictions, and once those lock-up periods expired, they began offloading their holdings into every market rally in search of liquidity. Visser said a similar dynamic is now playing out in crypto, as early investors and insiders in projects like Solana, Ethereum, and Bitcoin sell their holdings during every price rebound, weighing down the broader market. He clarified that it will not take 16 years for the crypto sector to recover as it did for tech stocks, but used the comparison to explain that the market is in a prolonged consolidation phase that could last up to another year before a decisive rebound occurs. The comments were made as sentiment across the digital asset market turned increasingly cautious. Many analysts and investment firms have scaled back their bullish forecasts, with some suggesting that a bear market may have started in October. Bitcoin, which recently dipped below $106,000, showed some early signs of stabilizing around the $100,000 level, though some analysts warn that continued selling pressure could push the price as low as $92,000. BTC’s price action over the past month (Source: CoinMarketCap ) According to CryptoQuant analyst Julio Moreno , the selling activity by whales and long-term holders is not inherently negative—it only becomes a drag on prices when demand fails to absorb the new supply entering the market. Moreno pointed out that since October, long-term holder selling increased as demand simultaneously weakened, leaving the market unable to sustain higher prices. This combination of diminished demand and persistent whale selling created a grinding market environment that is very similar to the consolidation seen in past post-bubble periods. This suggests that crypto may still have some way to go before a clear recovery begins.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,BTC|MARKET|TRADING|MACROECONOMICS|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-11-10 05:30:00

South Korea’s leading exchange Upbit has announced a temporary suspension of Moss Coin (MOC) deposits and withdrawals starting November 12 at 9:00 AM UTC. This crucial Upbit MOC suspension comes as the platform prepares for a significant network switch that could impact your trading activities. Why Is Upbit Implementing This MOC Suspension? The primary reason behind this temporary halt is a network migration for Moss Coin. When blockchain networks undergo upgrades or switches, exchanges must pause transactions to ensure security and prevent potential losses. This Upbit MOC suspension demonstrates the exchange’s commitment to protecting user assets during technical transitions. Network switches involve complex technical processes that require: Complete synchronization with the new blockchain Security verification of all transaction pathways Testing of deposit and withdrawal mechanisms Validation of smart contract functionality What Does This Mean for MOC Holders? If you currently hold Moss Coin on Upbit, here’s what you need to know about this Upbit MOC suspension . During the maintenance period, you cannot deposit new MOC tokens to your Upbit wallet or withdraw existing holdings. However, your assets remain secure in your account, and trading of MOC against other cryptocurrencies may continue unaffected. This temporary measure actually benefits users in several ways: Prevents transaction errors during network transition Ensures smooth migration to upgraded blockchain Maintains the integrity of your digital assets Provides time for comprehensive security checks When Will Normal Services Resume? Upbit has indicated that the Upbit MOC suspension will begin precisely at 9:00 AM UTC on November 12. The exchange typically provides updates through official channels once the network switch completes successfully. Users should monitor Upbit’s announcement page for the resumption notice, as the duration depends on the complexity of the migration process. Historical data shows that similar network upgrades usually take between 2-8 hours, but preparation is key. Therefore, plan your MOC transactions accordingly and avoid last-minute transfers around the suspension timeframe. How Can You Prepare for the Suspension? Smart cryptocurrency management means anticipating such events. Before the Upbit MOC suspension takes effect, consider these proactive steps: Complete any urgent MOC deposits or withdrawals beforehand Monitor Upbit’s official communication channels regularly Keep your account security measures updated Diversify your trading strategies to account for temporary limitations Remember that such suspensions are standard industry practice during network upgrades. Major exchanges like Upbit implement these measures to protect user funds and ensure seamless transition to improved blockchain networks. What Are the Long-Term Benefits? While temporary inconveniences exist, this Upbit MOC suspension ultimately serves the Moss Coin ecosystem’s growth. Network upgrades typically bring enhanced features such as faster transaction speeds, lower fees, improved security, and better scalability. These improvements can potentially increase MOC’s utility and market value over time. The cryptocurrency space evolves rapidly, and periodic network maintenance ensures your investments remain compatible with the latest technological advancements. Upbit’s proactive approach demonstrates their commitment to providing a secure and updated trading environment. Final Thoughts: Navigating Temporary Disruptions The upcoming Upbit MOC suspension represents a necessary step toward technological progress in the blockchain space. While temporary transaction halts might cause minor disruptions, they ultimately contribute to a more robust and efficient cryptocurrency infrastructure. Stay informed, plan ahead, and recognize that these measures protect your digital assets in the long run. The cryptocurrency landscape requires adaptability from both exchanges and users. Upbit’s transparent communication about the Moss Coin network switch sets a positive industry standard for handling such technical transitions responsibly. Frequently Asked Questions Can I trade MOC during the suspension? Typically, trading continues normally during deposit and withdrawal suspensions. However, check Upbit’s specific announcement for confirmation. How long will the Upbit MOC suspension last? Upbit hasn’t specified an end time, but similar network upgrades usually take 2-8 hours. Monitor official channels for updates. Are my MOC coins safe during this period? Yes, your existing MOC holdings remain secure in your Upbit wallet throughout the suspension. Will this affect MOC’s market price? Temporary suspensions rarely cause significant price impacts unless combined with other market factors. Should I move my MOC to another exchange before the suspension? Only if you need immediate access during the suspension period. Otherwise, waiting is generally safer to avoid transfer risks. How will I know when services resume? Upbit will publish an official announcement on their website and social media channels once normal operations restore.

The proposal passed a key procedural vote 60–40 and is expected to proceed to a final vote later this week before heading to the House for approval. They still need to vote to make it official, but the results will likely be positive, as both parties support the plan. The U.S. Senate plans to end the shutdown It’s now 40 days since the government shutdown, and citizens across the country are feeling the effects firsthand as public offices remain closed, federal workers haven’t been paid, and government services continue to be delayed. The shutdown has primarily affected financial markets, including cryptocurrency, as investors tend to dislike uncertainty. Republican Senate Majority Leader John Thune has made numerous attempts to meet with lawmakers from both parties, marking his 15th effort to resolve the issue. However, there is a glimmer of hope because senators are working on a three-part budget plan that will keep the government open until the end of January. Lawmakers will vote in December to extend tax credits from the Affordable Care Act for one more year and prevent or reverse layoffs of federal workers that happened during the shutdown. Senators received the final version of the budget bills before the weekend vote, allowing them more time to review the plan’s mission. And because the current situation is urgent, they have to return to Washington for a rare weekend session to vote on the plan. If all goes well, the Senate will proceed with the budget plan, and the government will finally open its doors after more than a month of shutdown. The crypto market reacts as the uncertainty goes down, and policies become clearer The price of Bitcoin increased rapidly and reached around $126,080 when the shutdown began, as investors saw an opportunity to buy while traditional markets remained uncertain about the future. However, as the shutdown lasted longer than expected, Bitcoin’s value fell by over 17% to approximately $104,370. This drop in Bitcoin occurred around the same time that President Donald Trump announced 100% tariffs on China, which unsettled global markets. Analysts say investors hesitated to buy, and institutions that planned to enter the crypto market stayed away because they were unsure how long the shutdown would last. Traders and analysts are closely monitoring the current situation, as past government shutdowns have had a similar impact on the cryptocurrency market. During the shutdown between December 2018 and January 2019, the price of Bitcoin increased from roughly $3,550 to $13,000 over the next five months after the government reopened. Prediction markets also expect the shutdown to end soon, as the probability that it will reopen between Tuesday and Friday increased from 27% to 54% on Polymarket. President Trump also announced that most Americans may receive a $2,000 dividend from tariff revenue to increase consumer spending and inject more money into the economy. Analysts will closely monitor the timing of the Senate vote, as the market could remain nervous and Bitcoin prices could fluctuate if lawmakers delay or contest the vote. They will also study how other cryptocurrencies behave in the first 24 to 72 hours after the government officially reopens and monitor trading volumes, as they represent the confidence among traders. Resolving the shutdown will restore confidence among traders and allow the cryptocurrency market to recover properly. Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies might also increase in value when new institutional investors show interest.

While this has negatively impacted markets, including cryptocurrencies, the long-awaited agreement may finally be coming. The first step toward reopening the government has been taken, with the US Senate passing a temporary funding bill that will fund the government until January, according to The Block. The bill passed with 60 votes in favor and 40 against. This decision followed reports that senators had reached a partial deal to end the government shutdown. Fourteen previous Senate votes failed to meet the 60 votes needed to enact the budget bill. While there are still hurdles to overcome, this vote paves the way for the shutdown to end by the end of this week. The bill must pass the House of Representatives before it goes to US President Donald Trump's desk for signature. As you may recall, Donald Trump also stated that he believed the shutdown would end soon. Bitcoin and Altcoins Started the New Week with an Uptrend! Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH) and altcoins are on the rise, fueled by renewed optimism in global markets following news that the government shutdown in the US may soon end. Bitcoin rose 4.5% in the last 24 hours to $106,100, while Ethereum rose 6.5% to $3,600. XRP gained 8.4%, BNB gained 3%, and Solana gained 7%. Peter Chung, Head of Research at Presto Research, said the positive political move from the Senate has helped ease recent market pressures. “The prolonged closure reduced market liquidity and exacerbated market tensions over the past few weeks,” Chung said. “However, the fact that this situation is now fading paves the way for risk assets to price in a positive macro environment, namely looser monetary policy, the end of trade disputes, and ahead of next year's midterm elections.” Vincent Liu, chief investment officer at Kronos Research, also said that the rise in Bitcoin and altcoins was helped by decreasing macro uncertainty and renewed policy optimism. *This is not investment advice.

Trump, in a post on Truth Social, said most citizens, except high-income Americans, will receive payments of at least $2,000. Trump stated that the US has collected “trillions of dollars” in tariffs, adding that these revenues would be used both to reduce the $37 trillion national debt and to give citizens “the rewards they deserve.” While praising the country's economic outlook, Trump lashed out at those criticizing the tariffs, calling them “idiots.” Chart showing the reaction of the BTC price to the Covid incentives announced at the end of 2020.

He also said that investment in the country and factory construction across the country are at a “historic peak.” In the same series of statements, Trump also addressed Republicans, stating that the lengthy government shutdowns that have led to the shutdown should be abolished. He argued that Republicans should shorten the process, reopen the government, and win the upcoming midterm elections by “passing big things.” *This is not investment advice.

The gap between online popularity and real-world connection remains wide – and ripe for innovation. This is precisely where SACHI steps in. The platform introduces a pioneering framework that fuses the viral energy of the creator economy with the unrepeatable spontaneity that defines legendary nightlife. It’s a cultural bridge between digital influence and physical experience, built to empower creators while captivating their audiences in completely new ways. At first glance, SACHI might appear to be simply another event collective tailored to modern tastes – and that’s partly true. But the vision goes far beyond that. SACHI is designing the infrastructure for a new era of audience conversion, loyalty, and community, embodied in what it calls “Creator-First Nightlife.” Redefining the Residency: Spikes for Conversion Bursts At the core of SACHI’s Creator-First Nightlife concept lies its innovative approach to the Residency . Traditionally, clubs and venues rely on resident performers to maintain steady, predictable turnouts night after night. SACHI reimagines this model by tapping into the built-in audiences of leading DJs, streamers, and influencers, creating events that pulse with high energy and full-capacity crowds. “The key insight is that a creator’s audience arrives in spikes – when a live stream starts, when a new track drops, or when a major announcement hits,” explains Jonas Martišius, CEO of SACHI. “Our Residencies are engineered to harness these moments, transforming them into premium, time-sensitive experiences that drive powerful conversion bursts. It’s as much about brand momentum as it is about unforgettable nights.” This precision-driven strategy ensures that while attendees may initially “come for the DJ,” the experience keeps them engaged long after, fostering loyalty to the broader SACHI community and nightlife culture. From Viewer to Regular: Unlocking Token-Gated Nights SACHI has created an ecosystem built to keep audiences coming back for more – because every experience here is designed to feel one of a kind. The ongoing demand to enter these premium spaces becomes a natural incentive, pushing fans to secure project-issued or community-earned tokens that grant access to SACHI’s exclusive Token-Gated Nights. These Token-Gated Nights represent a crossover of cutting-edge Web3 technology with the timeless appeal of high-profile residencies. In this system, digital tokens function as proof of membership – credentials that grant entry into real-world sections where unforgettable, once-in-a-lifetime experiences await. Participation can be as simple as following or subscribing to a creator online, making access both rewarding and attainable. Token-gating serves as a frictionless on-ramp, transforming a viewer’s admiration for a creator into tangible privileges that establish their place within SACHI’s exclusive communities. These tokens can unlock special privileges such as artist meet-and-greets, VIP seating, or priority access to upcoming events. Through this tiered structure, SACHI builds both anticipation and loyalty. At its core, this system turns quick social media interactions into real community connections. SACHI is redefining how audiences connect with creators, turning engagement into equity, and participation into belonging. “We’re giving the audience a piece of the action – a verifiable stake in the scene they’re helping to build,” said Jonas Martisius, CEO of SACHI. “It’s not just about controlling entry; it’s about acknowledging passion, rewarding dedication, and turning casual viewers into lifelong insiders.” The Blueprint for the Future of Creator-Led Entertainment SACHI believes that the future of entertainment involves the complete integration of performers and their audiences into wholesome, shared experiences. It is now providing a framework that converts audience loyalty and interactions with their favorite creators into a mutually beneficial environment where creators gain a reliable, high-impact venue for growth and monetization, while token-holding communities enjoy unique experiences. The key message is clear: The era of passive viewing is over. SACHI is building the active, engaged, and token-gated nightlife of tomorrow.

CoinShares’ XRPL, Franklin’s XRPZ, 21Shares’ TOXR, Canary’s XRPC, and Bitwise’s XRP ETF (XRP) are expected to hit the U.S. market by the end of November. The DTCC list, last updated on Friday, includes both active ETFs that may be processed at the DTCC and pre-launch ETFs that cannot yet be processed at the DTCC. Pre-launch ETFs usually lack the necessary regulatory and other approvals. Cryptopolitan reported nearly a week ago that XRP ETFs are expected to be launched in the U.S. within the next two weeks. U.S. SEC filings reveal that multiple XRP ETF products are in the pipeline, and the removal delay clauses (in S-1s) suggest that their approval is almost guaranteed. Cryptopolitan also noted that REX-Osprey’s XRPR ETF is already active in the U.S. markets, and rising XRP ETF speculation has created a market opportunity for XRP Tundra. Geraci predicts XRP ETFs could start launching this week Nate Geraci, co-founder of the ETF Institute, stated earlier today that the end of the government shutdown means the floodgates for spot crypto ETFs are opening. He pointed out that the first ‘33 Act spot XRP ETF could be launched as early as this week. In last week’s ETF buzz, Geraci disclosed that Canary’s spot XRP ETF is coming soon, maybe by the end of this week. Canary Capital filed with the U.S. SEC on November 8, seeking to list and trade on The Nasdaq. CoinDesk Indices calculate the Pricing Benchmark based on a 60-minute time-weighted average price of the XRP-USD CCIXber Reference Rate. The Trust also intends to have both Gemini and BitGo as its XRP custodians. Geraci also mentioned that WisdomTree has filed for the CoinDesk 20 ETF, which will hold 20 of the largest crypto assets by market cap that are eligible for inclusion in the index. XRP is expected to account for nearly 19.6% of the total holdings. “Sometime in the next two weeks, I expect the launch of first spot xrp ETFs…SEC had open litigation against Ripple for the past five years, up until three months ago…IMO, launch of spot xrp ETFs represents final nail in coffin of previous anti-crypto regulators.” – Nate Geraci , Co-founder of the ETF Institute Geraci’s weekly ETF buzz revealed that October saw a record month of 136 ETF launches. However, Roundhill CEO Dave Mazza noted that it is difficult for small, upstart issuers to survive in the ETF Terrordome, emphasizing that this fact is well documented. Schwab says investors are flooding into ETFs Charles Schwab’s latest ETF study suggests that nearly 62% of investors can envision putting all their money into ETFs. Half (50%) said they could be fully invested in ETFs in the next five years. Schwab believes this signals growing affinity for and reliance on ETFs to meet a range of investment needs. Meanwhile, Schwab observed that 66% of the respondents who participated in the study started investing in ETFs within the past five years. The majority of investors (~94%) also agreed that ETFs help them maintain low costs within their portfolios. Another 46% said ETFs offered access to asset classes that would otherwise be inaccessible. David Botset, Managing Director, Head of Strategy, Innovation, and Stewardship at Schwab Asset Management, asserted that the world of investing is undergoing a rapid transformation. He particularly pointed out that ETF investors are at the forefront of this evolving landscape. Botset believes many investors are using ETFs, which now outnumber individual U.S. stocks, for low-cost core portfolio investments.

54224740,624359,1762754404,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/54224740.jpeg,Why Are Bitcoin OGs Dumping Billions Of Dollars In BTC?,https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-ogs-dumping-btc/,"A recent report from Bitcoinist highlighted a disturbing trend among early Bitcoin investors that could explain why the cryptocurrency’s price has been in a perpetual state of decline. According to data from on-chain data analytics platforms, these early Bitcoin whales , who hold thousands of BTC, had begun selling their considerable stash. But even after a month of consistent dumping, it seems these large investors are far from done, and more pain could be ahead. Bitcoin Whales Dump Billions Of Dollars On The Market As the Bitcoinist report showed, two early Bitcoin whales began moving their holdings into centralized exchanges back in October. This selling continued into the new month, and by the first week of November, these two whales had sent more than 16,000 BTC to exchanges. In total, the value of the BTC came out to over $1.7 billion, showing the considerable sell pressure that Bitcoin had faced at the time. Following these initial sell-offs into the start of November, there seemed to be a slowdown in the selling , but this did not last very long. On-chain data platform Lookonchain reported that the whales were back at it once again, and this time, one of the whales had returned and looks to be selling the rest of their holdings. Bitcoin OG Owen Gunden is at the center of all of this selling, recently moving the last of his considerable Bitcoin holdings onto a centralized exchange. In total, Gunden sent 3,549 BTC worth $362.84 million at the time of the transaction to the Kraken exchange, after previously sending out 600 BTC worth $61.17 million. In total, Gunden has sent 11,000 BTC worth $1.12 billion to exchanges, presumably to sell . Why The Selling Is Ramping Up With these early Bitcoin whales on the move and triggering significant selling pressure on the market, the question has been why these investors are choosing to sell now after waiting for all of this time. This comes as the $100,000 level remains threatened, and these billion-dollar sell-offs could trigger a bear market. While crypto community members look for some deep meaning in the sell-offs, crypto influencer Udi Wertheimer gave a short and precise answer: the OGs are simply taking profit. These whales had bought their BTC when it was dirt cheap and have held onto their stash for around 15 years. Having grown considerably since then, with most becoming billionaires, it is only natural for these whales to sell and cash out their profits. Instead of asking why the whales are selling, Wertheimer explains that what investors should really be asking is “why is btc price not down -70% when so many OGs are selling?” Given the strength that Bitcoin is demonstrating amid the selling, the crypto influencer believes “that’s what should keep the bears up at night.”",Bitcoin|bitcoin|bitcoin news|bitcoin price|btc|BTC news|btc price|btcusd|BTCUSDT,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|EXCHANGE|MARKET|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-11-10 06:00:04

The chart shared by ChartNerd shows the three-month Ichimoku Cloud setup, an indicator widely used to gauge market momentum and trend direction. What makes this chart stand out is the structural change identified by The Great Mattsby, who noted that XRP is exhibiting behavior never before seen in its price history. According to Mattsby, “The 3-month Ichimoku Cloud demonstrates how powerful $XRP’s bull trend actually is.” $XRP : Further Bullish Signals https://t.co/vyjqqFrVhe pic.twitter.com/Brl3jAyoje — ChartNerd (@ChartNerdTA) November 8, 2025 XRP’s New Bullish Indicator He explained that XRP “has never built a base above the 3-month conversion or baseline in its history, and it’s doing it now for the past year.” This development, highlighted in the chart, represents a critical phase for the cryptocurrency. The Ichimoku Cloud’s conversion and baseline lines often act as dynamic support and resistance levels. Sustained price action above these levels is generally interpreted as confirmation of bullish strength. The current chart shows XRP maintaining its structure above both lines for the past four consecutive quarters. Historically, such positioning has not occurred for the token, which previously struggled to establish stability above these mid-term indicators during prior market cycles. This shift suggests that the asset has transitioned from reactive rallies to a more defined structural uptrend . What the Indicator Suggests for XRP’s Momentum The Ichimoku Cloud model is designed to show equilibrium within the market. When price action remains above the conversion and baseline for an extended period, it typically signals control by buyers and indicates that pullbacks are being absorbed. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 For XRP, maintaining this position across multiple quarterly candles highlights the possibility of a new long-term base forming. This setup means XRP may be in the early stages of a sustained expansion. The three-month timeframe adds weight to the analysis, as longer intervals filter out short-term volatility and highlight genuine directional strength. Should XRP continue to hold above the baseline, traders could see the next major test around prior resistance zones near the $3 area. Looking Ahead This configuration also offers insight into XRP’s potential resilience against broader market fluctuations. If the price remains supported above these key Ichimoku levels, it could provide a technical foundation for further growth. While shorter-term corrections are always possible, maintaining structure above these support regions tends to attract more institutional and long-term interest . With XRP trading around $2.46, analysts are closely monitoring whether the asset can preserve this structural base through the coming months.
